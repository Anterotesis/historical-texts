            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF a variety of editions, and innumerable comments can be ſuppoſed to perfect and correct the inaccurate text of a celebrated au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſufficient, one would think, has been done to leave that of Shakſpeare without a blemiſh. So ſlow, however, or ſo inefficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is the progreſs and exertion of verbal criticiſm, when moiling in the duſt and cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs of antiquity, ſo much is to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, ſo much to be rebuilt, that it will not, except to thoſe who place implicit confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the intereſted and unqualifyed aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every publiſher, be a matter of much ſurpriſe to learn, that, after all that has been done by the labour of Shakſpeares numerous editors and commentators,—after all that has been urged or aſſumed in favour of the laſt
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0047200200:3"/>edition, — as much more ſtill remains to be done to bring his text back even to the ſtate of correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which it was left by his firſt editors. A reader of heſitation and reflection will hear this with perfect calmneſs; he will be no ſtranger to the fluctuating ſtate of former editions; he will have noticed the boldneſs and aſſurance, the legislative and dictatorial manner in which every ſucceeding editor has uſhered hisſelf into the world; and will not eaſyly forget the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of each in aſſuring the public that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further could poſſibly be done to his author:—Is not this the language of Rowe, and Pope, and Theobald, and Warburton, and Hanmer, and Capell? And where are they now? Where even dr. Johnſon and mr. Steevens may, in the courſe of a few revolving years, be ſent to accompany them:—the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of oblivion or disgrace.</p>
            <p>The chief and fundamental buſineſs of an editor is carefully to collate the original and authentic editions of his author. It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impoſſible for him to be certain that he is giving the genuine text, becauſe he does not know what that text is. There have been no leſs than eight profeſsed editors of Shakſpeare; and
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0047200200:4"/>yet the old copies, of which we have heard ſo much, have never been collated by any one of them: no, not even either of the two firſt folios, books indifferently common, and quoted by every body. And yet, ſtrange as it may ſeem, not one of the eight but has taken the credit of, or actually aſſerted, his having collated them. One may be well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to paſs by the pretenſions of thoſe prior to dr. Johnſon without particular notice; their falſehood is ſufficiently apparent in the margin of the late edition. Surely, men who thus proudly expoſe and ſeverely reprobate the crimes of their neighbours ſhould effectually guard theirſelves againſt ſimilar accuſations.</p>
            <p>"I," ſays dr. Johnſon, "collated ſuch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies as I could procure, and wiſhed for more
<note n="1" place="bottom">(1) Preface, p. 59.</note>:" "I collated ... all [the folios] at the beginning, but afterwards uſed only the firſt
<note n="2" place="bottom">(2) Ibidem, p. 49.</note>." He muſt be very hardy, indeed, that dares give a flat contradiction to ſuch poſitive aſſertions as theſe from ſo reſpectable a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But the cauſe of Shakſpeare and truth obliges one to ſay that the learned writer is certainly mistaken. The text of his own edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0047200200:5"/>the notes of mr. Steevens, and, in ſome reſpect, the remarks in the following ſheets, will prove that he never collated any one of the folios, —no not for a ſingle play,— or at leaſt that of his collations he has made little or no uſe. That he picked out a reading here and there from the old editions, is true: all his predeceſſors did the ſame: but this is not <hi>colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So much for dr. Johnſon.</p>
            <p>With regard to the laſt edition, mr. Steevens explicitly tells us that "it has been conſtantly compared with the moſt authentic copies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther collation was abſolutely neceſſary to the ſenſe, or not
<note n="3" place="bottom">(3) Advertiſement, p. 69.</note>." "Would not any one, from this declaration," to uſe the ingenious critics own words, "ſuppoſe that he had at leaſt <hi>compared</hi> the <hi>folios</hi> with each other
<note n="4" place="bottom">(4) Ibidem, p. 68.</note>?" But he has been deceived, no doubt, by the perſon employed in this laborious but neceſſary work. What an abuſe of that confidence and credit which the public naturally place in an editor of rank and character, to tell them, that "by a diligent collation of all the old copies hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto discovered, and the judicious reſtoration
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0047200200:6"/>of ancient readings, the text of this author ſeems now finally ſettled
<note n="5" place="bottom">(5) Malones preface to his Supplement.</note>!" To what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe can we aſcribe ſuch unfounded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions than to indolence and temerity? ſince, had the ingenious writer compared the old and preſent editions through a ſingle play, he muſt neceſſaryly have perceived, that all the old copies had NOT been diligently collated, that ancient readings had NOT been judiciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and that the text is no more finally ſettled at preſent than it was in the time of Theobald, Hanmer, and Warburton: nay, that it is, at large, in the ſame ſtate of inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and corruption in which it was left by mr. Rowe.</p>
            <p>Theſe, it may be objected, are merely nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and unproved aſſertions. It is very true. And they who do not think them confirmed in the courſe of the following pages, and will not give theirſelves the trouble to investigate their truth, are at liberty to disbelieve them. To publiſh the various readings of the old edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be a buſyneſs of ſome labour, and little utility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0047200200:7"/>
As to the notes and conjectures here offered to the public, very little need be ſaid. Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare is <hi>the God of the writers idolatry,</hi> and ſhould any one of theſe remarks be thought pertinent or uſeful in the opinion of a ſingle individual who, like him, admires the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this darling child of nature and fancy, whom, <hi>age cannot wither,</hi> and whoſe <hi>infinite variety custom cannot ſtale,</hi> it will be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient gratification to him for the pains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in drawing them up. And if there ſhould be a future edition of this favourite, this inimitable author, the writer is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity to hope that the following ſheets may ſtimulate the editors care and attention to give his text with integrity, judgement, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs, —
<q>
                  <l>— a conſummation</l>
                  <l>Devoutly to be wiſh'd;</l>
               </q> and, which muſt of conſequence follow, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the number of exuberant and impertinent notes
<note n="6" place="bottom">(6) From a republication of the laſt edition nothing is to be expected. The work will continue, like the editions of Warburton and Hanmer, to dishonour crit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and to inſult Shakſpeare.</note>.</p>
            <p>The freedom with which every editor has treated his predeceſſors precludes the neceſſity
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0047200200:8"/>of an apology for the liberties taken in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing pages, with the ſentiments of ſome of our moſt eminent literary characters. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of a commentators rank, however, does not intitle his blunders to reſpect. It were to be wiſhed that dr. Johnſon had ſhewn ſomewhat leſs partiality to <hi>pride of place;</hi> for, though he profeſses to have treated his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors with candour, Theobald, the beſt of Shakſpeares editors, experiences as much ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility and injustice at his hands, as Hanmer and Warburton, the worſt of them, do defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect. For this, however, the learned critic might have his private reaſons, which, as they could ſcarcely have justifyed his conduct, he did right to conceal.</p>
            <p>To controvert the opinions, or disprove the aſſertions of mr. Steevens, dr. Farmer and mr. Tyrwhitt, men no leſs remarkable for their learning and genius than for their obliging dispoſitions and amiable manners, has been a painful and odious taſk. But whereever the writer has been under the neceſſity of differing from any of theſe gentlemen either in point of opinion or in point of fact, he will not be
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0047200200:9"/>found to have expreſsed hisſelf in a manner inconſistent with a due ſenſe of obligations and the profoundeſt reſpect. Such, at leaſt, was his intention, ſuch has been his endeavour, and ſuch is his hope.</p>

                     <p>The ſlighteſt alteration in the name of this great writer is a circumſtance of ſo much importance to the public, that, although the editors may not have been too haſty in preferring SHAKSPEARE to SHAKESPEARE, it might be wiſhed that a more deciſive and leſs equivocal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than his WILL had been produced to justify and enforce the change. This will, it ſhould ſeem, the poet made in his laſt ſickneſs, when he appears to have been ſo incapable of paying that attention to the writing of his name which a man in health uſually does, that he has actually ſubſcribed it two different ways: SHAKSPERE, and SHAKSPEARE. So that we are ſtill uncertain which mode to adopt. How negligent, therefor, have the editors been, and how much are they to be blamed, for not procuring better and more poſitive evidence, if it were to be come at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Mr. Garrick, as they muſt have known, though they did not think it neceſſary to notice the fact, had then in his poſſeſſion a leaſe or mortgage from Shakſpeare of a houſe in Blackfriars, ſubſcribed (as we learn from mr. Colmans preface to Beaumont and Fletcher) with his own hand, WM. SHAKSPEARE; which, very luckyly, confirms the alteration made, with leſs authority, by the preſent editors. This deed was discovered among ſome old writings by mr. Wallis, of Norfolk-ſtreet, who preſented it to mr. Garrick, in the poſſeſſion of whoſe widow it, moſt probably, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.

                     <p>Whenever the <hi>Merry Wives of Windſor</hi> may have been writt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, it is certain, as well from the enquirers quotations and remarks, as from the play its ſelf, that the time of action is in the reign of king Henry the fourth. But "if it ſhould be placed," ſays he, "as dr. Johnſon obſerves it ſhould be read, between the <hi>Second part of K. Henry IV.</hi> and <hi>Henry V.</hi>" (where, however, it cannot be introduced without the moſt flagrant impropriety) "it muſt be remembered that mrs. Quickly, who is half-bawd, half-hoſteſs in <hi>K. Henry IV.</hi> is, in the <hi>Merry Wives of Windſor,</hi> Dr. Caius's houſekeeper, and makes a decent appearance; and in <hi>K. Henry V.</hi> is Piſtols wife, and dies in an hoſpital; a progreſſion that is not very natural." It is ſtrange enough that the critic ſhould not perceive that <hi>Dr. Caiuses houſekeeper</hi> and <hi>the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady of the Boars-head</hi> are totally diſtinct characters; and have not, if we except their name, ſex, ſentiments, and loquacity, a ſingle circumſtance in common between them. Shakſpeare could have been at no loſs for one of the ſame name and family in any town in England.</p>

                     <p>From this practice, he ſuppoſes, the author wrote <hi>reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleth,</hi> which, though it affords no jingle, completes the verſe. "The old ballad of <hi>Titus Andronicus,</hi>" adds he, "is written in this meaſure, where the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> lines <hi>only</hi> rhime."

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> theſe obſervations than either of the ingenious commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors was aware of. Neither Shakſpeare nor Spenſer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from the above inſtances, at leaſt, to have taken the ſmalleſt liberty in extending his words: neither has the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of <hi>l</hi> or <hi>r</hi> being ſubjoined to another conſonant any thing to do in the matter. But that great authors and great critics ſhould not be better acquainted with the orthography and grammatical ſtructure of their native tongue, is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which, if not to be wondered at, is, ſurely, very much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0047200200:17"/>to be regretted. The truth is, that <hi>every</hi> verb in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage gains an <hi>additional ſyllable</hi> by its termination in <hi>eſt, eth, ed, ing,</hi> or (when formed into a ſubſtantive) in <hi>er:</hi> and the above words, when rightly printed, are not onely unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but moſt juſt. Thus, <hi>reſemble</hi> makes <hi>reſemble-eth; wrestle, wrestle-er;</hi> and <hi>ſettle, whistle, tickle,</hi> make <hi>ſettle-ed, whistle-ed; tickle-ed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Semblance,</hi> indeed, cannot properly be written as three ſyllables; neither, perhaps, is it altogether neceſſary to pronounce it ſo. <hi>Childeren,</hi> however, would be certainly right.</p>
                     <p>Another inſtance of this ſort occurs in <hi>K. John:</hi>
                        <q>That were <hi>embatteled</hi> and rank'd in Kent:</q> which ſhould now be written <hi>embattleed;</hi> though the verb was, probably enough, in Shakſpeares time, uſually ſpelled <hi>embattel.</hi>

                     <p>This paſſage, dr. Johnſon very gravely remarks, is much confuſed, and of confuſion, ſays he, the preſent reading makes no end. There is not, however, the leaſt room for altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Shakſpeare has evidently intended to make honeſt Launce puzzle and confound hisſelf in the arrangement of his <hi>dramatis perſonae;</hi> and, it ſhould ſeem, he has tolerably well ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>A ſimilar thought, mr. Steevens obſerves, occurs in a play of an <hi>elder</hi> date than this: <hi>A Chriſtian turn'd Turk,</hi> 1612. The <hi>Two Gentlemen of Verona</hi> is mentioned by Meres in 1598; and, in the opinion of mr. Malone, "bears ſtrong internal marks of an early compoſition." He therefor refers it to the year 1593. Surely then the play quoted by mr. Steevens can hardly be ſuppoſed to be of an elder date.</p>

A <hi>curtail dog,</hi> ſimply, is one of that inferior ſpecies of thoſe animals, now called <hi>curs,</hi> from the prevailing uſage of cutting their tails. A piece of wanton barbarity which (though, by no means, ſingular, even in <hi>this</hi> country) can onely be perpetrated by unfeeling wretches who ſeem to enjoy no more reaſon than is juſt ſufficient to plunge them into a more degraded and brutal ſtate than that of the poor animal they ſo inhumanly mangle.</p>

                     <p>As this is the firſt <hi>clown</hi> who makes his appearance in the plays of our author, mr. Steevens thought it not amiſs, from a paſſage in <hi>Tarltons News out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>

<q>— I ſaw one actired in ruſſet, with a buttoned cap on his head, a great bag by his ſide and a ſtrong bat in his hand; ſo artificially attired for a <hi>clowne,</hi> as I began to call Tarlton's wonted ſhape to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may, probably enough, have been the dreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſuch a character as the <hi>clown</hi> or <hi>fool</hi> in <hi>As you like it, All's Well that Ends Well, Twelfth Night,</hi> and <hi>King Lear;</hi> but the clown of this play is a different perſonage, the tapſter to a bawdy-houſe, and reſembles the above cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter no more than <hi>Launce, Speed, Costard,</hi> or <hi>Launclot Gobbo,</hi> the note and quotation, therefor, which might had their uſe elſewhere, are here certainly misplaced.</p>

                     <p>This ſpeech, as mr.

The clown points her out as they enter; and yet, from Claudios telling Lucio <hi>that he knows the lady,</hi> &amp;c. one would think, he ſays, ſhe was not meant to have made her perſonal appearance upon the ſtage.</p>
                     <p>That Julietta enters at the ſame time with Claudio;— that ſhe is not preſent during his converſation with Lucio; —and that ſhe is afterwards in the custody of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt;—are evident and certain.

                     <p>It was <hi>fourteen years</hi> in all the editions prior to Theobald who made the alteration. The reaſon of which, he, in his note upon the place, ſays, will be obvious to him who recollects what the duke has ſaid in a foregoing ſcene. But the <hi>duke</hi> had not before uttered a ſyllable about the matter; he muſt therefor mean <hi>Claudio,</hi> who mentions
<q>
                           <l>—the enrolled penalties</l>
                           <l>Which have, like unſcour'd armour, hung by the wall,</l>
                           <l>So long, that <hi>nineteen zodiacks</hi> have gone round,</l>
                           <l>And none of them been worn.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theobald ſays, the author could not ſo disagree with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and that it is neceſſary to make the two accounts corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond. But there is no reaſon to charge the author with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistency, neither is it neceſſary that the two ſpeakers ſhould agree in their calculation. If it were, the dukes account ſhould moſt certainly be preferred, as he was doubtleſs much better acquainted with the exact time of the disuſe of thoſe laws than Claudio can be reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been. For, though he may not be too young a man to have a perfect recollection of the circumſtance, (and it ſhould rather appear he is) yet it muſt be obſerved that he is <hi>about to ſuffer</hi> by the <hi>revival</hi> of <hi>theſe very penalties,</hi> which, both his intereſt and inclination would naturally lead him to repreſent as much more obſolete than they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually were.

                        <hi>Band</hi> is here rightly preſerved, but it is pleaſant enough to mark the conſistency of the editors, who make a merit of reſtoring it from <hi>bond,</hi> which, they obſerve, is in the old editions, and was formerly ſpelled <hi>band.</hi> The word <hi>porpentine</hi> appears throughout all the old copies, and in many contemporary writers; but this they have moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed to <hi>porcupine.</hi> The affirmative <hi>I,</hi> always uſed by Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare and others, has been likewiſe changed to <hi>ay,</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the injury of both ſenſe and rime. A number of words in every play are in the ſame predicament. And even this identical word <hi>band</hi> is elſewhere turned into <hi>band.</hi> Happy Shakſpeare!</p>
                     <p>A <hi>band,</hi> Mr. Steevens obſerves, is likewiſe a <hi>neckcloth;</hi> and on this circumſtance, he believes, the humour of the paſſage turns. But the ingenious gentleman is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a double mistake. A <hi>band</hi> is not, nor ever was, a <hi>neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi> though, certainly, an appendage to the neck. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does the humour of the paſſage turn upon any ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; for there would be very little humour in it, if it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0047200200:36"/>did. Adriana means a <hi>written band,</hi> and Dromio quibbles upon a <hi>hempen one.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. Heath, in his fancyful way, propoſes a different reading, while mr. Steevens is contented with ridiculing the preciſeneſs and affectation of master Capell.</p>
                     <p>But, after all, the text is very clear and intelligible, and certainly right. <hi>Kinsman</hi> means no more than <hi>near relation.</hi> Many words are uſed by Shakſpeare with much greater latitude.</p>

                     <p>"This is an admirable ſtroke of humour: <hi>Dogberry</hi> ſays of the priſoners that they are falſe knaves, and from that denial of the charge, which one in his wits could not but be ſuppoſed to make, he infers a <hi>communication of counſels,</hi> and records it in his examination as an <hi>evidence of their guilt."</hi> SIR J. HAWKINS.</p>
                     <p>It is with infinite reluctance that the writer finds hisſelf obliged to differ in opinion from the learned magistrate, who, from his having ſo long and ſo ably preſided upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0047200200:42"/>ſimilar occaſions, muſt, no doubt, be perfectly acquainted with the nature of a judicial proceſs.</p>
                     <p>That there is infinite humour in the paſſage is very true; and that the ingenious commentator has not discovered it is equally ſo; the ſentiments and conduct of master Dogberry being the direct reverſe of what he ſuppoſes them to be. We clearly perceive that in this examination Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry takes all the precaution poſſible to come at the truth; he charges them <hi>ſeverally</hi> with being <hi>falſe knaves;</hi> he <hi>takes the utmoſt care</hi> that they ſhall have <hi>no communication of counſels,</hi> in order to concert a joint defence, by onely <hi>whiſpering</hi> to <hi>one,</hi> what he had before aſked in the <hi>hearing of both;</hi> he is, therefore, aſtoniſhed to find them <hi>both in a tale,</hi> and directs it to be recorded, as a proof of their <hi>innocence,—that they are no knaves:</hi>—becauſe they had <hi>both told him ſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the more evident from the behaviour of the ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; who, in mr. Steevenses opinion, and he ſeems per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly right, ſhews as <hi>much good ſenſe</hi> on the occaſion as any <hi>judge upon the bench</hi> could do, and who immediately tells Dogberry, that he <hi>goes not the way to examine,</hi> and that he muſt <hi>call the watch,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If the learned annotator will amend his comment, by omitting the word <hi>guilt,</hi> and inſerting the word <hi>innocence,</hi> it will (except as to the ſuppoſed inference of a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of counſels which ſhould be likewiſe omitted or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) be a juſt and pertinent remark.</p>

                     <p>Pageant <hi>of the</hi> Nine Worthies.] This ſort of proceſſion was the uſual recreation of our ancestors at Chriſtmas, and other festive ſeaſons. Such things, being chiefly plotted and compoſed by ignorant people, were ſeldom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, at leaſt with the view of preſervation, and are, of courſe, rarely discovered in the reſearches of even the moſt industrious antiquaries. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that nothing of the kind (except the ſpeeches in this ſcene, which were intended to burleſque them) ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in print. The curious reader will not, therefor, be displeaſed to ſee a genuine ſpecimen of the poetry and manner of this rude and ancient drama from an original manuſcript of Edward the Fourths time. (MSS. Tanner. 407.)</p>

                        <hi>Dr. Warburtons note upon the old Romances.]</hi> The learned prelate has received ſuch a complete dreſsing, from the hand of a master, in the <hi>Supplement,</hi> that there is neither occaſion nor opportunity for any further remark. At the foot of this page, however, there is a note, by the celebrated dr. Percy, which ſeems to deſerve ſome little attention; and the more ſo, as it is countenanced by the very ingenious gentleman alluded to, who has either not been aware of its fallacy, or, from private motives, forborn to expoſe it.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Warburton," ſays this redoubted critic, "is quite mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in deriving Oliver from (Palmerin de) Oliva, which is utterly incompatible with the genius of the Spaniſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage." So that, from his thus recurring to etymology, he clearly appears to be not a whit better acquainted with the history than dr. Warburton was. "The old ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance," continues he, "of which Oliver was the hero, is entitled in Spaniſh, "Historias de los nobles Cavalleros Oliveros de Caſtilla, y Artus de Algarbe, in fol. en Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lladolid, 1501, in fol. en Sevilla, 1507;" and in French thus, "Hiſtoire d'Olivier de Castille, &amp; Aitus d'Algarbe ſon loyal compagnon, &amp; de Heleine, Fille au Roy d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleterre,

                     <p>From ſo much ſeeming knowlege, from the annotators great credit, and from his very confident aſſertions, who would be foreward to ſuſpect his ignorance, or doubt his veracity? But it is even ſo; he knows no more of the history which he quotes with ſo much parade, than biſhop Warburton knew of Amadis or Palmerin; with <hi>either of which</hi> the ſtory of <hi>Oliver the Paladin</hi> has juſt as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection as it has with the history of <hi>Oliver of Castile and Arthur of Algarbe.</hi> With reſpect to the above French and Spaniſh titles, they are literally tranſcribed from Freſnoy.

                     <p>Shakſpeare, ſays mr.

Oberon, Titania, and Puck never dye; the inferior agents muſt neceſſaryly be ſuppoſed to enjoy the ſame privilege; and the ingenious commentator may rely upon it, that the oldeſt woman in England never heard of the death of a Fairy. <hi>Human mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> is, notwithſtanding, evidently put in oppoſition to <hi>Fairies,</hi> who partook of a middle nature between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>ſpirits.</hi> Puck in a ſubſequent ſcene ſays,

                     <p>At the rehearſal of the play, leſt "the ladies ſhould be afear'd of the lion," being, as Bottom obſerves, "the moſt fearful wild fowl living," it was ſettled, that there ſhould be a prologue to tell, that Snug, who was to perform this terrible part, was <hi>not</hi> a lion; his name was, likewiſe, to be named, and half his face ſeen through the lions neck; through which he was, moreover, to ſpeak, "ſaying thus, or to this defect,—Ladies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you think I come hither <hi>as a lion,</hi> it were pity of my life: no, I am <hi>no ſuch thing; I am a man as other men are:"</hi>—and there, indeed, he was "to name his name; and tell them plainly he 'was' Snug the joiner." This prologue he is now delivering; but the paſſage muſt be read and pointed thus; the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being ſtrangely misconceived and misrepreſented by the preſent editors:
<q>

                           <l>A lion fell nor elſe no lions dam:</l>

That is, I am neither <hi>lion</hi> nor <hi>lioneſs,</hi> I am <hi>Snug the joiner.</hi> The text makes him declare that he <hi>is</hi> a lion, or comes <hi>as</hi> a lion, which is utterly inconſiſtent with the reſt of his ſpeech; defeats the very end and deſign of his prologue; and would have been enough ("God ſhield us!") to ſcare the ladies out of their wits.

                        <l>Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft,</l>
                        <l>In the Rialto you have rated me</l>
                        <l>About my monies, and my <hi>uſances.</hi>

                        <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>uſance,</hi> mr. Steevens ſays, are both words anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently employed for <hi>uſury.</hi> And, to justify the explanation, he quotes the two following paſſages from an old play:
<q>
                           <l>Give me my <hi>uſe,</hi> give me my principal.</l>
                           <l>A toy; the main about five hundred pounds,</l>
                           <l>And the <hi>uſe</hi> fifty.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, after all, is he not mistaken? <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>uſance</hi> mean nothing more than <hi>intereſt.</hi> And the former word is ſtill uſed by country people in the ſame ſenſe. His own authorities prove this to be the ancient meaning. <hi>Give me my</hi> intereſt, <hi>give me my principal. The</hi> main (<hi>i. e.</hi> the principal) <hi>five hundred pounds, and the uſe fifty;</hi> i. e. <hi>intereſt</hi> at <hi>ten per cent,</hi> the <hi>legal rate</hi> in Shakſpeares time: when, perhaps, the word <hi>uſury</hi> itsſelf had a much more innocent meaning than has been ſince annexed to it. In the old ſong of <hi>Neptunes raging fury, or the gallant ſeamans ſufferings,</hi> it ſignifies onely a <hi>ſcrivener:</hi>

There is not the leaſt difficulty in the paſſage. Launcelot is talking nonſenſe, or, as the vulgar have it, putting the cart before the horſe; but whether deſignedly or not is left to the contemplation of the critics.

                     <p>The terms propoſed, ſays dr. Johnſon, have been misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.

                     <p>How others have misunderſtood Anthonios terms, does not by this edition appear, and it might be policy in dr. Johnſon to ſuppreſs the account, for it is very clear that they are <hi>not</hi> underſtood by HIM. Anthonio tells the duke, that, if he will abate the fine for the ſtates half, he (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio) will be contented to take the other, <hi>in truſt,</hi> after Shylocks death, to render it to his daughters husband. That is, it was, during Shylocks life, to remain <hi>at intereſt</hi> in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonios</hi> hands, and <hi>Shylock</hi> was to enjoy the <hi>produce of it.</hi> The preſent reading is perfectly right, clear, and intelligible.

                     </sp>
                     <p>The crown of Scotland, mr. Steevens obſerves, was originally not hereditary. When a ſucceſſor was declared in the life time of a king, (as was often the caſe) the title of <hi>prince of Cumberland</hi> was immediately beſtowed on him as the mark of his deſignation.</p>
                     <p>The propriety of this note is not very apparent.</p>
                     <p>The crown of Scotland had been hereditary for ages before Duncan,—nay, from the very foundation of the Scotiſh monarchy. The <hi>apparent</hi> or <hi>preſumptive heir</hi> was always the known and declared ſucceſſor; as in England and every other hereditary government. The kings <hi>eldeſt ſon,</hi> or grandſon (<hi>i. e.</hi> the heir apparent for the time being) alone was <hi>prince of Cumberland,</hi> as the king of Englands is prince of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0047200200:81"/>Wales; or the king of France's, the Dauphin. And it ſhould ſeem, from the play, that Malcolm was the <hi>firſt</hi> who had this title.</p>

                     <p>This note, dr. Johnſon tells us, was written before he was fully acquainted with Shakſpeares manner, and he does not now think it of ſo much weight: why did he then reprint it? becauſe the words which he once thought interpolated by the players, he now thinks to have been interpolated by the author. But there never was ſurely ſuch a number of words waſted to ſuch an idle purpoſe. Whether Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth would have made uſe of the image is not the question: the words are as evidently Shakſpeares as any others in the play. And where was the neceſſity of ſo much <hi>learning</hi> to discover the alluſion? The idea was perſectly familiar to him.

                     <p>The <hi>ſhard-born</hi> beetle is, perhaps, the beetle <hi>born</hi> among <hi>ſhards,</hi> i. e. (not cows-dung, for that is only a ſecondary or metonymical ſignification of the word, and not even ſo, generally, but) pieces of broken pots, tiles, and ſuch like things which are frequently thrown together in corners as rubbiſh, and under which theſe beetles may uſually breed, or (what is all the ſame) may have been ſuppoſed to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>Thus, in Hamlet, the prieſt ſays, of Ophelia,

                     <p>Would mr. Tollet ſay that <hi>cows-dung</hi> was to be thrown into the grave? The ſpelling of <hi>born</hi> can have no weight any way.

                     <p>The meaning of this abrupt dialogue, dr. Johnſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is this: the <hi>perfect ſpy,</hi> mentioned by Macbeth in the foregoing ſcene, has, before they enter upon the ſtage, given them the directions which were promiſed at the time of their agreement; yet one of the murderers ſuborned,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0047200200:84"/>ſuſpects him of intending to betray them; the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that, by his exact knowledge of <hi>what they were to do,</hi> he appears to be employed by Macbeth, and needs not be mistruſted. A comment which there are ſew beſides the learned author that would not have been aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
                     <p>In the preceding ſcene, Macbeth ſays to the two firſt murderers.
<q>
                           <l>I will adviſe you where to plant yourſelves;</l>
                           <l>Acquaint you with <hi>the</hi> perfect ſpy o'the time,</l>
                           <l>The moment on't.</l>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>i. e.</hi> the very time when you are to look out for him. But dr. Johnſon has changed it to
<q>
                           <hi>A</hi> perfect ſpy o'the time,</q> and ſeems too conſident or too careleſs to perceive the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity he introduces. For, if Macbeth had made the two firſt murderers acquainted with this <hi>perfect ſpy</hi> of dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and they had received their directions from him, how could the firſt murderer poſſibly aſk him <hi>who</hi> bid him join them?—O, but, ſays the learned critic, he ſuſpects him of an intention to betray them. Betray them! To whom? To Banquo? To be ſure they had wonderful cauſe to be afraid of one whom the king hisſelf had appointed them to kill!—The fact plainly is, that this additional or ſupernumerary villain is ſent from Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, by way of reinforcement, after the others had taken their ſtand. He has told them that he was acquainted with the deſign, but one of them, being unwilling, it ſhould ſeem, to admit a third to participate in the reward, and therefor deſirous to ſhuffle him off, very naturally aſks, who bid <hi>him</hi> join them.</p>

                     <p>"It muſt be owned," ſays dr. Warburton, "that Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare is often guilty of ſome ſtrange abſurdities in point of history and chronology: yet here he has artfully avoided one. He had a mind to hint, that the cure of the <hi>evil</hi> was to deſcend to the ſucceſſors in the royal line in compliment to James the firſt. But the Conſeſſor was the firſt who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the gift: how then could it be at that time ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpoken of, that the gift was hereditary? this he has ſolved by telling us that Edward had the gift of prophecy along with it."</p>

"The ingenious editor of the <hi>Houſhold Book</hi> of <hi>the Fifth Earle of Northumberland,</hi> dr. Percy," adds mr. Steevens, "very acutely obſerves on the ſubject of cramp rings, "that the miraculous gift of curing the <hi>evil</hi> was left to be claimed by the Stuarts; our ancient Plantagenets were humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to cure the <hi>cramp."</hi>

With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to dr. Warburton, one would be glad to know, how he became ſo certain that Edward the Confeſſor was the firſt who pretended to this gift. Shakſpeare may be ſometimes chargeable with great abſurdities, but he rarely, if ever, commits ſuch a one as his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned commentator would here force upon him. If <hi>Edward the Conſeſſor</hi> had been the <hi>firſt</hi> Engliſh monarch poſſeſsed of this <hi>hereditary faculty,</hi> it muſt neceſſaryly have <hi>dyed with him,</hi> for he not onely was a <hi>uſurper,</hi> but <hi>left no iſſue.</hi> So that king James neither did, nor poſſibly could either <hi>claim</hi> or <hi>get</hi> it from <hi>him.</hi> And his real titles were too

                     <p>"It <hi>appears,</hi>" ſays mr. Steevens, in a note upon this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, "from dr. Johnſons <hi>Journey to the Weſtern Islands of Scotland,</hi> that the natives had neither <hi>kail</hi> nor <hi>brogues,</hi> till they were taught the arts of planting the one, and making the other, by the ſoldiers of Cromwell; and yet," adds he,
<q>king James VI. thought it neceſſary to form an act againſt ſuperfluous banquetting.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a pity that the ingenious commentator has omitted the very candid and liberal inference which the great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veler draws from the above circumſtance of the kail, <hi>i. e.</hi> that, "when they had not <hi>that,</hi> they had <hi>nothing."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But under the favour of this ingenious critic, it does <hi>not appear:</hi>—dr. Johnſon, indeed, is pleaſed to <hi>ſay ſo,</hi> and they who would have believed him if he had given a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0047200200:88"/>of his voyage into the moon, may, if they chooſe, believe this. It is very ſeldom that we find people teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others arts of which they are ignorant theirſelves, and yet this muſt have been the caſe with Cromwells ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; who were accustomed neither to eat kail, nor to wear brogues. The truth is, that both articles have, in all probability, been known to the Scotiſh ever ſince the country was inhabited. So that they may ſafely admit the truth of the above very candid travelers good-natured poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Steevens ſeems to think it altogether needleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain luxury in diet, where people could get neither <hi>kail</hi> nor <hi>brogues;</hi> which, to be ſure, are the very eſſence of a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous feaſt.</p>

But all theſe objections to, and propoſed alterations of the old reading, ariſe entirely from its not being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. If the reader will conſider the paſſage a moment, he will perceive that it has ſenſe and meaning,—is quite in the ſpirit of the cardinals quibbling logic,—and infinitely ſuperior to any of theſe pretended emendations. Pandulf, having conjured the king to perform his firſt vow to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,—to be champion of the church,—tells him, that what he has ſince ſworn is ſworn againſt hisſelf, and therefor may not be performed by him: for <hi>that,</hi> ſays he, which you have ſworn to <hi>do amiſs,</hi> is <hi>not amiſs</hi> (i. e. becomes right) when it is <hi>done truely</hi> (that is, as he explains it, not done at all); and being <hi>not done,</hi> where it would be a <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>do it,</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> is <hi>moſt done</hi> when you <hi>do it not.</hi>

                     <p>There is no difficulty in this, but what the over buſy critic chooſes to make.</p>
                     <p>"It is ſtrange that, when the ſenſe is ſo clear, any commentator ſhould thus laboriously obſcure it, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a new reading; and yet ſtranger that he ſhould ſhew ſuch confidence in his emendation as to inſert it in the text. JOHNSON."</p>

This claim the dauphin now aſſerts, and it is poſſible that Shakſpeare imagined him to have the right he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But the fact is, Arthur had left an infant ſister (Eleanor of Britain), who was then right heir to the crown, and <hi>de jure</hi> queen of England; and who, to the everlaſting disgrace of this country, languiſhed all her days in obſcurity and confinement; and, even ſuppoſing <hi>her</hi> out of the question, John, and his ſon Henry, had a better title than Blanch, who was onely that kings ſisters daughter; unleſs, indeed, he might be ſaid to have forfeited all right, by his unnatural cruelty to his nephew, whom he is believed to have murdered with his own hands: yet ſtill, even on that idea, would young Henrys title remain unimpeached; for neither then, nor in our authors time, was it underſtood, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal misconduct of the ancestor, could, in any caſe, bar the ſucceſſion of the innocent iſſue.

For it is evident, from the preceding ſcene, that there was a force in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0047200200:95"/>Wales, which Bolingbroke might think it neceſſary to ſuppreſs; and why, dr.

                     <p>Dr. Johnſon here takes an opportunity to cenſure Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare for deſerting the manners of the age in which his drama is placed:—this weapon, he ſays, not being ſeen in England till two centuries aftewards. It would be as well, however, though not quite ſo eaſy, for the learned critic to bring ſome proof in ſupport of this and ſuch like aſſertions. Without which the authority of Shakſpeare is at leaſt equal to that of dr. Johnſon. And, even if he could prove what he aſſerts (which, however, it is believed he cannot), the poets friends would ſtill have an argument which would render both his aſſertions and his proofs equally nugatory and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0047200200:97"/>not being ſatisfyed with either alteration, propoſes <hi>entrants</hi> inſtead of <hi>entrance,</hi> and explains it by, "thoſe who ſet foot on this kingdom through the luſt of power or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt (which was the kings own caſe)."

<q>O, 'tis our ſetter; I know his voice.—<hi>Bardelph,</hi> what news?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This he pronounces to be abſurd; and therefor alters the paſſage as above; with very little reaſon, and againſt all authority. The modern editors, noticing an omiſſion, make Bardolph to enter with Gadshill. The learned critic calls this a countenancing of the impropriety, and, therefor,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0047200200:101"/>does not bring Bardolph on at all. There is no abſurdity in the paſſage, except that of which the learned commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator is guilty. Falſtaffs calling out for Bardolph is no proof that he was within hearing. The latters entrance ſhould be marked, and the old reading reſtored.</p>

                     <p>Dr. Johnſon is very fond of giving the reader continual information, that the play proceeds in one unbroken tenor through the firſt edition,—that there is, therefor, no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the diviſion of the acts was made by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; and that, ſince, every editor has the ſame right to mark the intervals of action as the players who made the preſent distribution, he would propoſe, to change them ſo and ſo.</p>

But there is little room to doubt that the pauſes of action marked in the firſt folio have been intended, or, at leaſt, approved by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. The player editors divided the different dramas juſt as they were <hi>broken in the repreſentation.</hi> And, moſt, if not all, of Shakſpeares plays having been performed at his own theatre, and under his own eye, it is very improbable that he ſhould not have given directions about the diviſion of the acts. If there had been no distinction of acts in the playhouſe copies, meſſieurs Hemings and Condell would never have troubled their heads about the matter. No edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has therefor any right to alter that diviſion which is eſtabliſhed by the two firſt folios: unleſs in two or three places where the misplacing of the <hi>actus</hi> is too glaringly abſurd to admit a doubt of its impropriety.</p>

                     <p>Notwithſtanding the learned prelate is ſo confident in his opinion, and ſo zealous to engage the king in a war with France, and to cauſe ſuch a deluge of Christian blood, it will not be improper for the readers of this play to reflect, that he had no more right to the throne of that kingdom, than Charles VI. had to the crown of England. Henry propoſes the invaſion and conqueſt of France in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the dying advice of the uſurping Machiavel his father:
<q>
                           <l>— to <hi>buſy giddy minds</hi>
                           </l>

                     </p>
                     <p>The poet, ſays Theobald, might intend, "take from them the ſenſe of reckoning thoſe oppoſed numbers; <hi>which</hi> might pluck their courage from them." But the <hi>relative,</hi> adds he, not being expreſsed, the ſenſe is very obſcure.</p>
                     <p>This change, according to dr. Johnſon, is rightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by biſhop Warburton. Sir Thomas Hanmer, it ſeems, reads:
<q>
                           <l>— the oppoſed numbers</l>
                           <l>Which ſtand before them.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reading, dr. Johnſon ſays, he borrowed from the old quarto, which gives the paſſage thus:
<q>
                           <l>Take from them now the ſenſe of reckoning,</l>
                           <l>That the oppoſed multitudes that ſtand before them</l>
                           <l>May not appall their courage.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. Tyrwhitt allows that Theobalds alteration makes a very good ſenſe; but he thinks that we might read, with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0047200200:120"/>leſs deviation from the old edition, what is adopted in the preſent text.</p>
                     <p>After all, the old reading appears to be right; though none of the commentators has attempted to explain it. The king prays that his men may be unable to reckon the enemys force; that their hearts (<hi>i. e.</hi> their ſenſe and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) may be taken from them: <hi>that they may be as brave as a total abſence of all feeling and reflection can make them</hi>
                        <note n="14" place="bottom">(14) Junius.</note>. An explanation which ſeems to be countenanced by the old 4to.</p>
                     <p>A learned friend inclines to think that, by—their <hi>hearts,</hi> the king means the hearts <hi>of the oppoſed numbers.</hi>

                     <p>This reading is certainly right, though not properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by dr. Johnſon.

The firſt part of dr. Warburtons note is ſingularly juſt. It is, indeed, a mockery of Heaven in Henry to expect pardon for a crime of which he continued to enjoy the benefit. And, certainly, if ever the divine judgement ought to have interfered, or did actually interfere in viſiting the ſins of the fathers upon the children, it was in this very caſe of the houſe of Lancaster.</p>

If we may believe the moſt authentic historians ſhe was no leſs diſtinguiſhed for virtue than courage. She was burnt, indeed, by the barbarous Engliſh, whom ſhe had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently driven before her, and who, to excuſe their want of courage or policy, and to justify their inhumanity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that ſhe had dealt with the devil! But her memory will, no doubt, be long held in deſerved veneration by her grateful countrymen, whom ſhe ſo largely contributed to reſcue from uſurpation and ſlavery. And it is not the leaſt praiſe of our elegant historian, mr. Hume, that he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do justice to the much injured character of this amiable, brave, wiſe, and patriotic female.</p>
                     <p>The dauphin, too, whom we are apt to look upon as a traitor, a coward, and a ſcoundrel, was, perhaps, the greateſt character of the age he lived in. He was one of the beſt kings France ever had, and England never had a better.</p>

This, ſays mr. Theobald, is king Henrys reply to his wife Margaret. There can be no reaſon, adds he, why the king ſhould forget his own wiſes name, and call her Nell inſtead of Margaret. As the change of a ſingle letter, he thought, ſet all right, he was willing to ſuppoſe it came from his pen thus:
<q>I thank thee. <hi>Well,</hi> theſe words content me much.</q> And this the editors have adopted without further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. That the queens name was <hi>Margaret</hi> and not <hi>Eleanor</hi> is an allowed fact. But that the king ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it is not at all ſurpriſing, as, in the progreſs of the ſcene, we find, that ſhe forgets it <hi>herſelf,</hi> calling herſelf <hi>Eleanor</hi> no leſs than three times in one ſpeech. Of this, however, it ſhould ſeem that mr. Theobald has not taken any notice: at leaſt none is taken of it in this edition, which every where reads <hi>Margaret.</hi> The change in the three inſtances alluded to was certainly requiſite: and the ſame neceſſity and the ſame reaſoning which displaced <hi>Eleanor</hi> and inſerted <hi>Margaret,</hi> muſt, in the paſſage under conſideration, displace <hi>Nell</hi> and inſert <hi>Meg.</hi>

                     <p>"I know not," ſays dr.

Rutland is under a mistake. The battle of St. Albans, in which old Clifford was ſlain, happened in 1455; that of Wakefield in 1460. He appears to have been at this time above ſeventeen years old.</p>

Clifford in his retreat was beſet with a party of Yorkiſts, when, "eyther," ſays the historian, "for heat or payne putting off his gerget ſodainly with an arrowe (as ſome ſay) without an hedde [he] was ſtriken into the throte, and incontinent rendered his ſpirite, and the erle of Weſtmerlandes brother, and almoſt all his company were thare ſlayn, at a place called Dinting-dale, not farr fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Towton."

                     <p>Shakſpeare is not ſingular in ſuppoſing Henry to be the true repreſentative of the line of Lancaster. The tyrannous and bloody dispoſition of this monarch, and his immediate ſucceſſor (neither of whom was at all inferior in cruelty, and the firſt of them far ſuperior in craft and cunning to the monſter he dethroned), joined to the goodneſs of their title under the houſe of York, made it unſafe, and perhaps unneceſſary to canvas his deſcent. So that fear, flattery, neglect, and ignorance, ſeem to have eſtabliſhed the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which moſt of our historians, and people in general hold of Richmonds being what he here pretends to be. But he is an impostor: his great grandfather, John duke of Somerſet, from whom he derived the little title he had, was bastard ſon to John of Gaunt, and, though legitimated by act of parliament as to other purpoſes, utterly incapable of inheriting the crown. The right heir of the houſe of Lancaster, which, indeed, as oppoſed to the line of York, had not the ſmalleſt legal pretenſions to the throne, was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0047200200:147"/>then, and ſtill is, in the royal family of Portugal, in virtue of its deſcent from the lady Philippa, eldeſt daughter to John of Gaunt.</p>

This, to be ſure, is one way for an editor to get rid of difficulties—by transferring them to his readers. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance, however, fortunately happens to be none. The moſt ſovereign preſcription in Galen, ſays Menenius, is, to this news, but <hi>empiricutic:</hi>—an adjective evidently formed by the author from <hi>empiric</hi> (<hi>empirique,</hi> F.) a quack.</p>

                     <p>This is a ſtrange charge. If nature have denyed to this great critic the ordinary feelings of humanity, is he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for to accuſe the poet? Surely, dr. Johnſon is the onely perſon living who would not be aſhamed to declare hisſelf
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0047200200:155"/>inſenſible to the intereſting and pathetic ſcenes of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable drama. So far from Shakſpeares adherence "to the real ſtory and to Roman manners" having "impeded the natural vigour of his genius," he ſeems to have riſen with the grandeur and importance of his ſubject; and, if there be any one play in theſe volumes which affects the heart more than the reſt it may be ſafely averred to be this of Julius Caeſar. And he who is not "agitated in peruſing it" may defy the powers of poetry to move him.</p>
                     <p>The characters or dogmatical criticiſms ſubjoined by the above learned philoſopher at the end of each play are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (as in the preſent inſtance) as unjuſt in theirſelves, as injurious to the immortal author; and, in many caſes, could onely proceed from one who either had not read the drama reviewed, or, from ſome natural defect, was inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its beauty and merit.</p>

Johnſon, in his preface to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, has very elaborately endeavoured to prove that an <hi>arm-gaunt</hi> ſteed is a ſteed with <hi>lean-ſhoulders. Arm,</hi> adds he, is the Teutonic word for <hi>want,</hi> or <hi>poverty. "Arm gaunt</hi> may be therefore an old word, ſignifying <hi>lean</hi> for <hi>want,</hi> ill-fed. Edwards's obſervation, that a worn out horſe is not proper for Atlas to mount in battle, is impertinent: the horſe here mentioned ſeems to be a poſt-horſe, rather than a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe."</p>
                     <p>It is ſomewhat remarkable that when this great critic is deſirous to introduce his own note on a paſſage whereon a much better has been already written, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally begins his obſervation by ridiculing that of his predeceſſor. Mr. Seward, (not <hi>Seyward</hi> as dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, mr. Steevens, and mr. Malone, have every where
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0047200200:157"/>throughout this edition corrupted his name) explains the word <hi>arm-gaunt</hi> by <hi>thin ſhoulders,</hi> which, he ſays, is known to be one of the principal beauties of a horſe. And he adds that the epithet has, from the uncommon uſe of either part of the compound word in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dr. Johnſons obſervation that this ſteed was a poſt horſe is "impertinent;" as a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe would ſcareely have made any distinction between Antony and his groom: and yet the author repreſents it ſo proud of its burthen that its neigh ſilenced the by-ſtanders.</p>

                     <p>That is, according to dr. Warburton, "Though it be now too late to retrieve your former fortunes, yet it is not too late to prevent, by the aſſiſtance of your friends, your future miſeries." Sir T. Hanmer, it ſeems, made the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, which, though undoubtedly wrong, dr. Johnſon thought right, and admitted into his text. The old read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, is not properly explained by dr. Warburton. <hi>Though I tell you this,</hi> ſays Flavius, <hi>at too late a period, perhaps, for the information to be of ſervice to you, yet late as it is, it is neceſſary that you ſhould be acquainted with it.</hi> It is evident that the ſteward had very little hope of aſſistance from his masters friends.</p>

                        <hi>Scene II.</hi> — <hi>Enter Poet and Painter.</hi>] "The Poet and the Painter were within view when Apemantus parted from Timon, and might then have ſeen Timon, ſince Apemantus, ſtanding by him could ſee them: But the ſcenes of the thieves and ſteward have paſsed before their arrival, and yet paſsed, as the drama is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, within their view. It might be ſuſpected, that ſome ſcenes are transpoſed, for all theſe difficulties would be removed by introducing the Poet and Painter firſt, and the thieves in this place. Yet I am afraid the ſcenes muſt keep their preſent order; for the Painter alludes to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0047200200:164"/>the thieves when he ſays, <hi>he likewiſe enriched poor ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling ſoldiers with great quantity.</hi> This impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act, and the Poet and Painter in another: but it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that in the original edition this play is not divided into ſeparate acts, ſo that the preſent distribution is arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and may be changed if any convenience can be gained, or impropriety obviated by alteration. JOHNSON."</p>
                     <p>Had the learned critic peruſed the ſmall remainder of the Painters ſpeech, he would have perceived another incongruity, of which he does not ſeem to be aware. In the immediately preceding ſcene (the firſt of the fifth act) Flavius, Timons ſteward, has a conference with his master, and receives gold from him. Between this and the preſent ſcene, a ſingle minute cannot be ſuppoſed to paſs; and yet the Painter tells his companion:—<hi>'tis ſaid, he gave</hi> his ſteward a <hi>mighty ſum.</hi> Where was it ſaid? Why in Athens, whence, it muſt therefor ſeem, they are but newly come. <hi>Here</hi> then ſhould be fixed the commencement of the <hi>fifth act,</hi> in order to allow time for Flavius to return to the city, and for rumour to publiſh his adventure with Timon. But how are we, in this caſe, to account for Apemantuses announcing the approach of the Poet and Painter in the laſt ſcene of the preceding act, and before the thieves appear? It is poſſible that, when this play was abridged for repreſentation, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this paſſage and the entrance of the Poet and Painter, may have been omitted by the players, and theſe words put into the mouth of Apemantus to introduce them: and that when it was publiſhed at large, the interpolation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed. Or, if we allow the Poet and the Painter to ſee Apemantus, it may be conjectured that they did not think his preſence neceſſary at their interview with Timon, and had therefor returned back into the city.</p>

                     <p>Dr. Warburton propoſes <hi>rear'd</hi> for <hi>read,</hi> and ſays, that the ſoldier had onely ſeen the rude heap of earth. But dr. Johnſon, who ſeems to have thought, that the chief part of his buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſted in a <hi>totis viribus</hi> oppoſition to the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious improvements of preceding commentators, and that there is as much honour to be got by the demolition, as by the erection, of an elegant ſtructure, obſerves that the ſoldier "had evidently ſeen ſomething that told him <hi>Timon was dead;</hi> and what could tell that but his tomb? The tomb he ſees, and the inſcription upon it, which not being able to read, and finding none to read it for him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims peeviſhly, <hi>ſome beaſt read this,</hi> for it muſt be read, and in this place it cannot be read by man."</p>
                     <p>Now with all proper deſerence to the misunderſtanding and confuſion under which the learned critic labours in the above note, it is evident that the ſoldier, when he firſt ſees the heap of earth does not know it to be a <hi>tomb.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that Timon muſt be dead, becauſe he receives <hi>no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> It is likewiſe evident that when he utters the words <hi>ſome beaſt, &amp;c.</hi> he has <hi>not</hi> ſeen the inſcription. And dr.

Dr. Johnſon is not content with repreſenting the ſoldier as peeviſh; he makes him a perfect fool. For thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſagacious commentators expoſition, will his ſoliloquy ſtand:—<hi>I cannot read theſe letters; I muſt get</hi> ſome beaſt <hi>to</hi> read them for me; <hi>for, read they muſt be; and read, in this place, they cannot be, by man!</hi> But, firſt, where was the ſo urgent neceſſity of the inſcription being read at all? and, ſecondly, why could <hi>no man</hi> read it where it was?</p>

                     <p>This paſſage convinces mr. Steevens, that this play was the work of one converſant with the Greek tragedies in their original language; and, therefor, not of Shakſpeare. "We have here," ſays he, "a plain alluſion to the <hi>Ajax</hi> of Sophocles, of which no translation was extant in the time of Shakſpeare." If the fact were true, of which, however, neither mr.

<note n="18" place="bottom">(18) Theobald has ſuppoſed a paſſage in this play to have been gleaned from the Hecuba of Euripides. But, ſays mr. Steevens, upon that occaſion, "mr. Theobald ſhould firſt have proved to us that our author underſtood Greek, or elſe that this play of Euripides had been translated. In the mean time becauſe neither of theſe particulars are verified, we may as well ſuppoſe he took it from the old ſtory book of the Trojan war, or the old translation of Ovid." Why ſhould mr. Steevens require a proof from Theobald of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which he hisſelf here aſſumes as a matter of fact?</note>, numbers of printed tracts, and even large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, having periſhed ſince that period, as accidents and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0047200200:167"/>the reſearches of antiquarians dayly prove, ſtill Shakſpeare might have been indebted for the circumſtance to ſome manuſcript verſion, or the information of a more learned friend. Or (as is very probable) the ſame alluſion may be contained in other old books. There are many expreſſions in the courſe of the play which do not prove the author to have been very familiar with the ancients. Among other inſtances which might be adduced, Marcus praiſes Lavinia for her excellent performance on the <hi>lute.</hi> And it will not be very eaſy to decide whether the characters, or, at leaſt, the times are Christian or Heathen.</p>

                     <p>The folio and quarto editions, it ſeems, read <hi>brooch,</hi> which leads dr. Johnſon to think the meaning equivalent to one of Achilles' <hi>hangers</hi>-on. Mr. Malone, who, it muſt be confeſsed, generally comes foreward to a very good or uſeful purpoſe, obſerves that <hi>Brooch</hi> had ſome meaning at preſent unknown. For, ſays he, in the following paſſage
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0047200200:169"/>in Lodges <hi>Roſalynde,</hi> 1592, it ſeems to ſignify ſomething very different from a <hi>pin</hi> or a <hi>bodkin:</hi> "His bonnet was green, whereon ſtood a copper <hi>brooch</hi> with the picture of St. Dennis." A <hi>brooch</hi> is an <hi>ornament;</hi> likewiſe a <hi>buckle</hi> of uncommon workmanſhip, for the hat or breaſt. Such a one as had an image or figure of St. Dennis upon it, would probably conceal the pin or prong, which kept it faſt to the hat or girdle. K. Lewis the eleventh of France generally wore a leaden figure of <hi>St. Andrew</hi> in his hat, which, perhaps, anſwered the purpoſe of a <hi>brooch</hi> or buckle.</p>

Mr. Steevens ſuſpects that <hi>you muſt not know when he ſups,</hi> ſhould be added to the ſpeech of Pandarus; and that the following one of Paris ſhould be given to Helen. He thinks that <hi>dispoſer</hi> ſhould be changed into <hi>depoſer;</hi> and ſuppoſes that ſhe addreſses herſelf to Pandarus, and, by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer,</hi> means—ſhe who thinks her beauty (or, whoſe beauty you ſuppoſe) to be ſuperior to mine.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Steevenses conjecture is very ingenious and happy, but the propriety of his explanation is very doubtful. The dialogue ſhould, perhaps, be regulated thus:</p>

                     <p>Dr. Johnſon mistakes in aſſerting the uniformity of the the copies. The ſecond folio reads the fifth ſpeech thus:

                     <p>

                        </q> But the interjection is certainly no part of the ſong: and conſequently ſhould not appear in the ſame character: it is uttered by Pandarus after he has done ſinging. This is evident from Helens obſervation:

                     <p>For the ſake of rime, dr. Johnſon ſays, we ſhould read:

Neither rime nor reaſon requires the alteration. Ulyſſes aſks her if he may <hi>beg</hi> a kiſs; ſhe ſays, he may; he then <hi>deſires</hi> it: ſhe bids him <hi>beg,</hi> which he does. The conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is plain enough; and if the rime be thought worth preſerving by a violence to the text we may read:
<q>Why beg <hi>toe.</hi>

                     <p>Each reading is right in its place. <hi>Couſin</hi> was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expreſſion from one kinsman to another, out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of parent and child, brother and ſister.

<q>But now my <hi>couſin</hi> Hamlet, and my <hi>ſon.</hi>
                        </q> And in this very play, act III. lady Capulet ſays,

Surely the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0047200200:187"/>poet and his friends are under very little obligation to the ingenious commentator for producing an indecent paſſage which he ſuppoſes one or other of them to have already ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsed. But, after all, the learned editor is mistaken: for, deſpicable as the lines are, they were NOT blotted either by the poet or by his friends:—and if he will take the trouble of turning to either of the folios he will THERE find them.</p>

                     <p>The hunts up, mr. Steevens ſays, was the name of the tune anciently played to wake the hunters, and collect them together. And, in proof of it, he quotes a number of paſſages; to which, if the pleaſe, he may add the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from Charles Cottons <hi>Virgil Travestie</hi> (which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is ſomewhat extraordinary he ſhould omit):
<q>I'll <hi>play</hi> the rakehells ſuch a <hi>hunts up.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There was likewiſe a little rude ſong, which, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was formerly in uſe on this occaſion, as we learn
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0047200200:192"/>from Puttenham, <hi>Art of Engliſh Poeſie,</hi> 1589. "One <hi>Gray,</hi>" ſays he, "what good estimation did he grow into with king Henry [the eighth], and afterward with the duke of Somerſet protectour, for making certain merry ballades, whereof one chiefly was, <hi>The hunte is up, the hunte is up.</hi>" Whether the following be the identical <hi>merry ballade,</hi> doth not clearly appear; it is, however, very old:
<q>
                           <l>The hunt is up, the hunt is up,</l>
                           <l>And now it is almoſt day;</l>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Master Gray was, probably, author of both words and muſic; and the tune may have remained in uſe, after the words were forgot.</p>

Whatever may be the temporary religion, Popiſh or Protestant, Paganiſm or Christianity, if its profeſſors have the ſlighteſt regard for genius or virtue, Shakſpeare, the poet of nature, addicted to no ſystem of bigotry, will always be a favourite. There never was but one ſet of men who profeſsed open enmity to his name and writings, and they were, at the ſame time, the declared and moſt virulent enemies of literature and morality, in every ſhape: It is ſcarcely neceſſary to add the mention of the barbarous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts of the laſt century; one, and perhaps the beſt founded of whoſe charges againſt that great and good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch whom they ſo ſavagely murdered was—his intimacy with the writings of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE!!!—The circumſtance would, at this time, at leaſt, paſs unnoticed in ſuch a miscreant as <hi>Cocke,</hi> to whom a hatred of letters was as natural as it was to his more illustrious predeceſſor <hi>Jack Cade:</hi>—but when we ſee Milton—the ſublime Milton—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon the enormity of this amiable trait in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his murdered and libeled ſovereign—our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for and detestation of the act is equaled by our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to find <hi>him</hi> the aſſaſſin!</p>

It was neceſſary, however, that the ſurviving characters ſhould be made acquainted with the circumſtances which produce the catastrophe, and we ſhould have had more reaſon to condemn the poet for being <hi>brief</hi> than <hi>tedious.</hi> That our judicious author knew when to tell his ſtory behind the curtain, and when upon the ſtage, is evident from the next play; and it was, perhaps, to avoid a ſameneſs between the concluſion of that and preſent, that he has made the friar reveal the transaction to the audience; which naturally introduces the reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the two families and the moral reflections at the end of the ſcene, which, whatever the critic may think, are too valuable to be ſacrificed to his mere rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs abridgement of it.</p>

Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly Marcellus was an officer, whoſe duty it was to viſit each watch, and perhaps continue with it ſome time.

                        <hi>Rots itſelf,</hi> is the reading of the two firſt folios; that of the <hi>quarto,</hi> mr.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0047200200:204"/>"To be in a quiescent ſtate" he ſays, "<hi>(i. e.</hi> to <hi>root itſelf</hi>) affords an idea of activity." Very little activity, one would imagine, is neceſſary for the purpoſe of a weed <hi>rooting itsſelf;</hi> and that little is made almoſt none, when it <hi>roots itsſelf in eaſe.</hi> To <hi>rot,</hi> he thinks, better ſuits with the dullneſs and inaction to which the ghoſt refers." "And yet," adds he, "the accuſative caſe <hi>itſelf</hi> may ſeem to demand the verb <hi>roots.</hi>" And with that reading the text would certainly be better. For, ſetting aſide the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of giving an <hi>octive</hi> ſignification to a <hi>neuter</hi> verb, it is far from being either neceſſary or even proper that the ghoſt ſhould have any alluſion to <hi>rottenneſs</hi> and <hi>decay:</hi> fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity being generally attended, at leaſt in this world, with a tolerable ſhare both of good health and of good fortune.</p>

                     <p>How far it detracts from the virtue of Hamlet to be repreſented as lying in wait for an opportunity to take an adequate and complete revenge upon the murderer of his father, is a question not, with ſubmiſſion to the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt, quite ſo eaſyly decided.

But, indeed, the reaſons Hamlet here gives for his conduct, as they are better than any other perſon can make for him, will fully justify both him and it, againſt all ſuch hypercritical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the end of time.</p>

Mr. Malone, however, with the aſſistance of a "ſlight correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already made by ſir T. Hanmer," thinks he has recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled all difficulties. By <hi>a dozen paſses between yourſelf and him,</hi> he underſtands a dozen paſses <hi>for each.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, ſays he, is—"The king hath laid, that in a dozen paſses a-piece between you and Laertes, he ſhall not have the advantage of you by three hits. <hi>He</hi> (viz. the king) <hi>hath laid on</hi> the terms of Laertes making twelve hits <hi>for nine</hi> which you ſhall make."—Or perhaps, he adds, the laſt <hi>he</hi> means Laertes, and then it will run—"<hi>He</hi> (viz. Laertes) hath laid on terms of making <hi>twelve hits</hi> for <hi>nine</hi> which you ſhall make." This, continues the ingenious critic, juſt exceeds Hamlets number by three. If therefor, ſays he, Laertes in his 12 paſses ſhould make 12 hits, and Hamlet in his 12 but 9, the king would loſe.—If on the other hand, Laertes ſhould make but 11 hits, and Hamlet 9, or Laertes 12 and Hamlet 10, his majesty would win.</p>

                     <p>"Let us review for a moment the behaviour of Hamlet, on the ſtrength of which Horatio founds this eulogy, and recommends him to the patronage of angels.</p>
                     <p>"Hamlet, at the command of his father's ghoſt, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes with ſeeming alacrity to revenge the murder; and declares he will baniſh all other thoughts from his mind. He makes, however, but one effort to keep his word, and that is, when he mistakes Polonius for the king. On ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, he defers his purpoſe till he can find an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of taking his uncle when he is leaſt prepared for death, that he may inſure damnation to his ſoul. Though he aſſaſſinated Polonius by accident, yet he deliberately procures the execution of his ſchool-fellows, Roſencrantz and Guildenſtern, who appear to have been unacquainted with the treacherous purpoſes of the mandate they were employed to carry. Their death (as he declares in a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent converſation with Horatio) gives him no concern, for they obtruded themſelves into the ſervice, and he thought he had a right to deſtroy them. He is not leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the distraction and death of Ophelia. He
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0047200200:225"/>comes to interrupt the funeral deſigned in honour of this lady, at which both the king and queen were preſent; and, by ſuch an outrage to decency, renders it ſtill more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the uſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r to lay a ſecond ſtratagem for his life, though the firſt had proved abortive. He comes to inſult the brother of the dead, and to boaſt of an affection for his ſister, which, before, he had denied to her face; and yet at this very time muſt be conſidered as deſirous of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the character of a madman, ſo that the openneſs of his confeſſion is not to be imputed to him as a virtue. He apologizes to Horatio afterwards for the abſurdity of this behaviour, to which, he ſays, he was provoked by that nobleneſs of fraternal grief, which, indeed, he ought rather to have applauded than condemned. Dr. Johnſon has obſerved, that to bring about a reconciliation with Laertes, he has availed himſelf of a dishoneſt fallacy; and to conclude, it is obvious to the moſt careleſs ſpectator or reader, that he kills the king at laſt to revenge himſelf, and not his father.</p>
                     <p>"Hamlet cannot be ſaid to have purſued his ends by very warrantable means; and if the poet, when he ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed him at laſt, meant to have enforced ſuch a moral, it is not the worſt that can be deduced from the play; for as <hi>Maximus,</hi> in Beaumont and Fletchers <hi>Valentinian,</hi> ſays,

"I have dwelt the longer on this ſubject, becauſe Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſeems to have been hitherto regared as a hero not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving the pity of the audience; and becauſe no writer on Shakeſpeare has taken the pains to point out the immoral tendency of his character."</p>
                     <p>There are very few, it is believed, at all acquainted with this inimitable author, who would not be ſurpriſed, nay aſtoniſhed, at ſuch a ſevere and unexpected attack upon his principal and moſt favourite character: a character every one has been hitherto led to admire and eſteem, not more by univerſal and long eſtabliſhed opinion, than by the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and feelings of his own mind. To find the amiable, the injured, the distracted, and unfortunate Hamlet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a worthleſs and immoral being, totally undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the leaſt pity from thoſe almoſt numberleſs audiences whom the united force of Nature, Shakſpeare, and Garrick has compelled to weep for his misfortunes; and whoſe compaſſion would not be leſs in the cloſet than in the theatre, ſeems the moſt extraordinary and irreconcilable proceeding in a writer of genius and learning that can be well imagined. However, as the heavy charges which are here brought againſt him will, upon the ſlighteſt examination, appear to be groundleſs, unwarrantable, and unjuſt, there is little reaſon to fear that the confidence and ingenuity with which they are advanced and ſupported will anſwer the purpoſe of the learned objector.</p>
                     <p>Hamlet, the onely child of the late king, upon whoſe death he became lawfully intitled to the crown, had, it ſeems, ever ſince that event, been in a ſtate of melancholy, owing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive grief for the ſuddenneſs with which it had taken place, and an indignant horror at his mothers ſpeedy and incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marriage. The ſpirit of the king his father appears, and makes him acquainted with the circumſtances of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0047200200:227"/>fate, which he excites him to <hi>revenge:</hi> this Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let engages to do: an engagement it does not appear he ever forgot. It behoved him, however, to conduct hisſelf with the greateſt prudence. The uſurper was powerful, and had Hamlet carryed his deſign into immediate execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it could not but have been attended with the worſt conſequences to his own life and fame. No one knew what the ghoſt had imparted to him; till he afterwards made Horatio acquainted with it: and though his interview with the ſpirit gave him certain proof and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reaſon to know and deteſt the uſurper, it would ſcarcely, in the eye of the people, have justifyed his killing their king. To conceal, and, at a convenient time, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, his purpoſe, he counterfeits madneſs, and, for his greater aſſurance, puts the ſpirits evidence and the uſurpers guilt to the teſt of a play, by which the truth of each is manifeſted. He ſoon after eſpies the uſurper at prayers, but reſolves, and with great justice reſolves, not to kill him in the very moment when he might be making his peace with heaven: inasmuch as a death ſo timed would have been rather a happyneſs than a puniſhment, and, by no means, a proper revenge for his fathers murder. We next find him in the queens apartment, endeavouring to make her ſenſible of the ſtate of vice and horror into which her unnatural connection with the uſurper had plunged her. At the beginning of this conference he mistakes Polonius, who was <hi>behind the arras,</hi> and about to alarm the houſehold, for the uſurper, and, under that apprehenſion, ſtabs him. The ſpirit appears (not very neceſſaryly, perhaps) "to whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his almoſt blunted purpoſe." He is, immediately, ſent off to England: and, in his paſſage, discovers the treacherous and fatal purpoſe of the commiſſion with which his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and pretended friends were charged. Theſe men, he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0047200200:228"/>knew, had eagerly ſolicited and even thruſt theirſelves upon this employment; and he had, of courſe, ſufficient reaſon to conclude that they were well acquainted with the nature and purport of their fatal packet. That Shakſpeare meant to charge them with this knowlege, and to repreſent them as <hi>participes criminis,</hi> is evident from the old black letter <hi>Hystorie</hi> which furniſhed him with the ſubject, where they are not only made privy to, but actually <hi>deviſe</hi> the ſcheme to take Hamlets life. His own ſafety depended on their removal; and, at ſuch a time, and under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he would have been fully justifyed in uſing any means to procure it.</p>
                     <p>That he is "accountable for the distraction and death of Ophelia" is a moſt ſtrange charge indeed. He had, to be ſure, accidentally killed her father, whom he <hi>took for his betters.</hi> This cauſes her distraction; and her distraction cauſes her death. A moſt lamentable train of circumſtances! and with which the moral character of Hamlet is as little concerned at that of the ingenious, though uncandid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator.</p>
                     <p>That "he comes to interrupt the funeral deſigned in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this lady," is an aſſertion which has nothing but the credit of the aſſerter to ſupport it. Walking with his friend Horatio through a churchyard, he enters into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with a grave-digger; but, preſently, obſerving the approach of a funeral proceſſion, he ſays to Horatio, to whom he was then ſpeaking:

                        </q> Hamlet exclaims: <hi>What! the fair Ophelia?</hi> His ſurpriſe and aſtoniſhment on hearing Laertes name his ſister are manifeſtly apparent, and may ſerve to convince the learned critic, and every one who has been misled by his ill-founded accuſations, that Hamlet does NOT come to interrupt the funeral, and is guilty of NO outrage what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. He as little "comes to inſult the brother of the dead," or "to boaſt of an affection for his ſister, which before he had [in a wild and careleſs manner when he was under the neceſſity of <hi>counterfeiting madneſs</hi>] denied to her face." Laertes bids
<q>
                           <l>— Treble woe</l>
                           <l>Fall ten times treble on that curſed head,</l>
                           <l>
                              <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0047200200:230"/>Whoſe wicked deed thy moſt ingenious ſenſe</l>
                           <l>Depriv'd thee of;</l>
                        </q> an execration Hamlet cannot but perceive to be pointed at hisſelf. Having uttered this curſe, Laertes, haſtyly, and in direct violation of all decorum, jumps into the grave, where he "rants and mouths it" like a player. This out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous proceeding ſeems to infect Hamlet; who, forgetting hisſelf, as he afterward, with ſorrow, owns to Horatio, and, by the "bravery" of the others grief being worked up "into a towering paſſion," leaps in after him: and he who thinks Hamlets madneſs or ſincerity counterfeit here does not appear to know ſo much of Shakſpeare or of human nature as every one who reads this play ought to do.</p>
                     <p>The affection Hamlet now boaſts for Ophelia was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and violent; we find him with the very ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the beginning of the play, and he has never once disowned it, except on a ſingle occaſion, when the ſacrifice was required by his aſſumed character; a circumſtance which cannot, at leaſt ought not to, be imputed to him as a crime.</p>
                     <p>The behaviour and language of Laertes is more ranting and unnatural, than noble and pathetic, and, with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration upon Hamlet previously to his leaping into the grave, and the violent ſhock which Hamlet might feel on learning the corſe to be Ophelias, might eaſyly work up to, and apologiſe for, a higher pitch of extravagance, a ſtronger and more compoſed mind than that of which Hamlet appears to have been then master.</p>
                     <p>Hamlets converſation with Laertes, immediately before the fencing ſcene, was at the queens earneſt intreaty, and though dr. Johnſon be pleaſed to give it the harſh name of "a dishoneſt fallacy," there are better, becauſe more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, judges who conſider it as a moſt gentle and pathetic
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0047200200:231"/>addreſs; and cannot perceive it to be either dishoneſt or fallacious: for, certainly, Hamlet did not intend the death of <hi>Polonius;</hi> of conſequence, unwittingly, and by mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, injured Laertes, who, after declaring that he was "ſatisfyed in nature," and that he onely delayed his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reconcilement till his honour were ſatisfyed by elder masters, whom, at the ſame time, (for he has the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death in his hand) he never meant to conſult, ſays,
<q>
                           <l>— Till that time,</l>
                           <l>I do receive your offer'd LOVE LIKE LOVE,</l>
                           <l>And WILL NOT WRONG IT.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>On which the truely virtuous, innocent, and unſuſpecting Hamlet replies,
<q>
                           <l>— I embrace it freely</l>
                           <l>And will this BROTHERS wager frankly play.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the conduct and ſentiments of Laertes, in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and in his converſation with the uſurper, together with his villainous deſign againſt the life of Hamlet, be examined and tryed by any rules of gentility, honour, or humanity, natural or artificial, he muſt be conſidered as a treacherous, cowardly, diabolical wretch. Is ſuch a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to riſe on the fall of the generous Hamlet?</p>
                     <p>Things are ſometimes obvious to very careleſs ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or readers, which are not discerned by thoſe who play cloſer attention to the ſcene. Hamlet, in a trial of ſkill with Laertes, receives an unexpected, a treacherous, and mortal wound. Immediately before the company enter, he appears to be much troubled in mind; his ſpirits fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding what was to happen: "If it be now," ſays he, "'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come; the readyneſs is all."
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0047200200:232"/>He does not appear to have ſuſpected Laertes of any unfair practice (he did not know ſo much of him as we do), but he had every reaſon to expect treachery and murder from the uſurper; he might too have heared ſomething of his ſecret juggling with Laertes; and, doubtleſs, intended to revenge the death of his father. Being thus wounded, and on the threſhold of futurity, if he had not killed the uſurper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, the villain would have eſcaped unpuniſhed. But he does not ſtab him for his treachery toward hisſelf,—he upbraids him with his crimes of INCEST and MURDER,— and conſigns him to the infernal regions,
<q>With all his 'rank offences' thick upon him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that he ſufficiently revenges his father, his mother (who, by the way, dyes, if not deſervedly, at leaſt unpityed), and hisſelf. As to his own fall, every reader or ſpectator muſt ſympathiſe with Horatio, for the untimely loſs of a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prince poſſeſsed of ſuch great and amiable qualities, rendered miſerable by ſuch unparalleled misfortunes;
<q>
                           <l>—For he was likely, had he been put on,</l>
                           <l>To have prov'd moſt royally;</l>
                        </q> and who falls a ſacrifice to the moſt baſe and infernal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations. His death, however, is not to be looked upon as a puniſhment; the moſt innocent, as Shakſpeare well knew, are frequently confounded with the moſt guilty; and the virtues of Hamlet were to be rewarded among thoſe angels which his friend Horatio invokes to eſcort him to everlaſting reſt.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Akenſide was a very ingenious, ſenſible, and worthy man: but enough has been ſaid to ſatisfy thoſe who doubt, that the conduct of Hamlet is neither unnatural nor inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible. That his intellects were really impaired by the circumſtances enumerated by the above learned phyſician,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0047200200:233"/>is very probable; and, indeed, Hamlet hisſelf, more than once, plainly inſinuates it. See, in particular, the latter part of his ſoliloquy at the end of the ſecond act.</p>
                     <p>The oppoſing and refuting of general charges by proof and circumſtance commonly requires much more time and ſpace than the making of them. The writer is ſenſible that the arguments here adduced are neither arranged ſo judiciously, nor expreſsed ſo well, as the objections of the learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator; but from what has been ſaid, and as it is ſaid, it will appear, that it has not been without ſtrong and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſons that Hamlet has "been hitherto regarded as a hero not undeſerving the pity of the audience;" and the ingenious critic will not, perhaps, have much cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate hisſelf, on being the onely perſon who has taken pains to point out the <hi>immoral tendency</hi> of as noble, as virtuous, and as intereſting a character,
<q>As e'er 'imagination' cop'd withall.</q>

                     <p>This paſſage is too ſtubborn for any but a master critic to attack; and thoſe who have hitherto attempted it have little reaſon to boaſt of their ſucceſs.

Mr. Tollet thinks one might read <hi>ſalſe wife.</hi> Mr. Tyrwhitt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the true reading is <hi>fair life.</hi> Mr. Steevens, in a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent note, obſerves, that <hi>almoſt damn'd in a wife</hi> can onely be ſaid of a man who is near being marryed; thinking, it ſeems, that a man actually marryed is not <hi>almoſt,</hi> but <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether damn'd.</hi> It is, however, ſettled that Caſſio is the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine, and evident that <hi>wiſe</hi> can never be the true word; ſince he neither is marryed, nor, till ſome time after, has any connection with a woman, at leaſt to our knowlege.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0047200200:235"/>Mr. Tyrwhitt ſeems to have come the neareſt to what we may conceive to be Iagos meaning; and as his emendation does ſo little violence to the text, the editors would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been justifiable in adopting it.</p>

                     <p>It may be the moſt ſpirited, but it is ſurely the leaſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.

Malones muſhroom aſſistants in this notable piece of editorial cookry, "that trenchers, which, in the time of our author, were generally uſed, were <hi>cleanſed</hi> by <hi>ſcraping</hi> ONLY, and were <hi>never waſhed.</hi> They were <hi>ſcraped</hi> daily," continues he, "till they were <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely worn away.</hi>" An aſſertion as ridiculous as untrue. The ſcraping of a trencher is merely preparatory and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to its being thoroughly <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>ſcoured.</hi> If <hi>ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> had been the <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>dayly</hi> proceſs, theſe laſting and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable utenſils would not onely have been ſoon entirely ſcraped away, but have ſcarcely been fit to eat off a ſecond time. And if mr. White (the trencher-ſcraper in the note) have been uſed onely to ſcrape, and never to waſh his trenchers, one cannot well envy his gueſts the luxury of <hi>fouling a plate with him.</hi>

                  <p>From this quibble mr. Malone conjectures that the word <hi>one</hi> was anciently pronounced as if it were written <hi>on.</hi> That this was the ancient and original pronunciation is very probable, as appears from the word <hi>only</hi> (onely), and the vulgar uſage in many counties at this day. But that it was not the general practice in our authors time is evident from the following paſſages:</p>

                     <p>The ingenious commentator is moſt certainly mistaken. Shakſpeare, ſo far from having deviated from history, has

Whethamſtede ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly tells us that the Lancastrians, in direct breach of a mutual agreement, and before the day appointed for the battle, fell ſuddenly upon the dukes army, and took him and the earl of Salisbury priſoners; treating both, but eſpecially the duke, in the moſt ſhameful manner. <hi>Nam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſtatuentes eum ſuper unum parvum formicarium colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, &amp; quoddam ſertum vile, ex palustri gramine confectum, imponentes, per modum coronae, ſuper capud ſuum, non aliter quam Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>THE GENUINE TEXT OF SHAKSPEARE.</head>
            <head>
               <hi>Preparing for the Preſs,</hi> AN EDITION OF THE PLAYS OF WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, WITH NOTES.</head>
            <p>THIS edition will be compriſed in eight duodecimo volumes; and will be carefully and accurately printed from the onely copies of real authority, the two firſt folios. But although theſe editions will be the ſtandard of the intended work, ſuch paſſages in the old quartos as may appear to have been omitted by accident, or with a view to ſhorten the repreſentation, and every various reading, will be maturely conſidered, and, if wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of inſertion, be adopted, either in the text or margin, as their importance or merit may ſeem to require. No variation, however, will be made from the ſtandard edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:0047200200:249"/>without appriſing the reader of it, unleſs the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould conſiſt merely in a ſlight typographical error. Nor is any difference between the various editions in other reſpects intended to be otherwiſe than occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. The orthography will be reduced with the utmoſt care to a modern and uniform ſystem, except where a change would be injurious to the authors ſenſe and meaning. Various or doubtful readings will be ſettled from an attentive examination of the ſentiments of every commentator. The notes, which will be very ſparingly introduced, and never but where they ſeem abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or peculiarly proper, will be chiefly extracted, under the names of their reſpective authors, from the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Theobald, Warburton, Johnſon, and Steevens; but not to the excluſion of better, though, perhaps, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous, intelligence, if it can be given. It is, however, no part of the editors deſign to fill his margin with a view of the corruptions, or a refutation of the errors of preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commentators.</p>
            <p>The authors life, with the uſual documents (particularly a more exact copy of his will than has been yet publiſhed), and the prefaces of his various editors will be prefixed to to the work: which will, likewiſe, be attended with a new, copious, and accurate gloſſary. And, in an additional vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, it is propoſed to give a complete verbal index, adapted to the intended edition.</p>
            <p>This edition will, with regard to the correctneſs of the text, be infinitely ſuperior to any that has yet appeared. It will poſſeſs all the advantages of every former edition, and be as little liable, it is hoped, as poſſible to the defects of any.</p>
