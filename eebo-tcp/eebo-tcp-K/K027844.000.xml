            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOUGH there are ſeveral excellent perſons of the church of England, whoſe good intentions and endeavours have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to propagate the goſpel in foreign parts, who have even combined into a ſociety for that very purpoſe, and given great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only for Engliſh miſſionaries in the Weſt-Indies, but alſo, for the reformed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, led by their example to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate chriſtianity in the Eaſt: It is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs acknowledged, that there is at this day, but little ſenſe of religion, and a moſt notorious corruption of manners, in the Engliſh colonies ſettled on the continent of America, and the iſlands. It is alſo acknowledged that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath hitherto made but a very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0563700800:3"/>
progreſs among the neighbouring Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, who ſtill continue in much-what the ſame ignorance and barbariſm, in which we found them above a hundred years ago.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore venture to ſubmit my thoughts upon a point, that I have long conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to better judgments, in hopes that any expedient will be favourably hearkned to, which is propoſed for the remedy of theſe evils. Now in order to effect this, it ſhould ſeem the natural proper method, to provide, in the firſt place, a conſtant ſupply of worthy clergy-men for the Engliſh churches in thoſe parts; and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, a like conſtant ſupply of zealous miſſionaries well fitted for propagating chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity among the ſavages.</p>
            <p>For tho' the ſureſt means to reform the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and ſoften the behaviour of men, be, to preach to them the pure uncorrupt doctrine of the goſpel, yet it cannot be denied that the ſucceſs of preaching dependeth in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the character and skill of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Foraſmuch as mankind are more apt to copy characters than to practiſe precepts, and foraſmuch as argument, to attain it's full ſtrength, doth not leſs require the life of zeal, than the weight of reaſon; and the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which maketh great impreſſion, when delivered with decency and addreſs, loſeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of its force by paſſing thro' aukward or unskilful hands.</p>
            <p>Now the clergy ſent over to America have proved, too many of them, very meanly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified both in learning and morals for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their office. And indeed little can be expected from the example or inſtruction of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0563700800:4"/>
thoſe, who quit their native country on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive, than that they are not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a livelihood in it, which is known to be often the caſe.</p>
            <p>And tho' it be allowed that ſome of theſe have approved themſelves men of merit, it will at the ſame time be allowed, that the moſt zealous and able miſſionary from England muſt find himſelf but ill qualified for converting the heathen, if we conſider the difference of language, their wild way of living, and above all, the great jealouſy and prejudice which ſavage nations have towards foreigners, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations introduced by them.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations make it evident, that a college or ſeminary in thoſe parts is very much wanted; and therefore the providing ſuch a ſeminary, is earneſtly propoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to all thoſe, who have it in their power, to contribute to ſo good a work. By this, two ends would be obtained.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the youth of our Engliſh plantations might be themſelves fitted for the miniſtry; and men of merit would be then glad to fill the churches of their native country, which are now a drain for the very dregs and refuſe of ours.</p>
            <p>At preſent, there are, I am told, many churches vacant in our plantations, and many very ill ſupplied; nor can all the vigilance and wiſdom of that great prelate, whoſe peculiar care it is, prevent this, ſo long as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid churches are ſupplied from England.</p>
            <p>And, ſupplied they muſt be, with ſuch as can be picked up in England or Ireland, till a nurſery of learning for the education of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0563700800:5"/>
is founded. This indeed might provide a conſtant ſucceſſion of learned and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſtors; and what effect this muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have on their flocks, I need not ſay.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the children of ſavage Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, brought up in ſuch a ſeminary, and well inſtructed in religion and learning, might make the ableſt and propereſt miſſionaries for ſpreading the goſpel among their countrymen; who would be leſs apt to ſuſpect, and readier to embrace a doctrine recommended by neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or relations, men of their own blood and language, than if it were propoſed by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who would not improbably be thought to have deſigns on the liberty or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their converts.</p>
            <p>The young Americans neceſſary for this purpoſe, may, in the beginning be procured, either by peaceable methods from thoſe ſavage nations, which border on our colonies, and are in friendſhip with us, or by taking captive the children of our enemies.</p>
            <p>It is propoſed to admit into the aforeſaid college only ſuch ſavages as are under ten years of age, before evil habits have taken a deep root; and yet not ſo early as to prevent retaining their mother tongue, which ſhould be preſerved by intercourſe among themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is further propoſed, to ground theſe young Americans thoroughly in religion and morality, and to give them a good tincture of other learning; particularly of eloquence, hiſtory, and practical mathematicks: to which it may not be improper to add ſome skill in phyſick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0563700800:6"/>
If there were a yearly ſupply of ten or a dozen ſuch miſſionaries ſent abroad into their reſpective countries, after they had received the degree of maſter of arts in the aforeſaid college, and holy orders in England, (till ſuch time as epiſcopacy be eſtabliſhed in thoſe parts) it is hardly to be doubted, but, in a little time the world would ſee good and great effects thereof.</p>
            <p>For, to any conſidering man, the employing American miſſionaries for the converſion of America, will, of all others, appear the moſt likely method to ſucceed; eſpecially if care be taken, that, during the whole courſe of their education, an eye ſhould be had to their miſſion; that they ſhould be taught betimes to conſider themſelves as train'd up in that ſole view, without any other proſpect of proviſion, or employment; that a zeal for religion, and love of their country, ſhould be early and conſtantly inſtilled into their minds, by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lectures and admonitions; that they ſhould not only be incited by the common topics of religion and nature, but farther animated and enflamed by the great examples, in paſt ages, of publick ſpirit and virtue, to reſcue their countrymen from their ſavage manners, to a life of civility and religion.</p>
            <p>If his majeſty would graciouſly pleaſe to grant a charter for a college to be erected in a proper place for theſe uſes, it is to be hoped a fund may be ſoon raiſed, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of well-diſpoſed perſons, ſufficient for building and endowing the ſame. For as the neceſſary expence would be ſmall, ſo there are men of religion and humanity in England,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0563700800:7"/>
who would be pleaſed to ſee any deſign ſet forward for the glory of God and the good of mankind.</p>
            <p>A ſmall expence would ſuffice to ſubſiſt and educate the American miſſionaries in a plain ſimple manner, ſuch as might make it eaſy for them to return to the coarſe and poor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of life in uſe among their countrymen; and nothing can contribute more to leſſen this expence, than a judicious choice of the ſituation, where the ſeminary is to ſtand.</p>
            <p>Many things ought to be conſidered in the choice of a ſituation. It ſhould be in a good air; in a place where proviſions are cheap and plenty; where an intercourſe might eaſily be kept up with all parts of America and the iſlands; in a place of ſecurity not expoſed to the inſuits of pyrates, ſavages, or other enemies; where there is no great trade, which might tempt the readers or fellows of the college to become merchants, to the neglect of their proper buſineſs; where there are neither rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es nor luxury to divert, or leſſen their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to make them uneaſy and diſſatisfied with a homely frugal ſubſiſtence: laſtly, where the inhabitants, if ſuch a place may be found, are noted for innocence and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of manners. I need not ſay of how great importance this point would be toward forming the morals of young ſtudents, and what mighty influence it muſt have on the miſſion.</p>
            <p>It is evident the college long ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in Barbadoes would be defective in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe particulars; for tho' it may have its uſe among the inhabitants, yet a place of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0563700800:8"/>
ſo high trade, ſo much wealth and luxury, and ſuch diſſolute morals, not to mention the great price and ſcarcity of proviſions; muſt at firſt ſight ſeem a very improper ſituation for a general ſeminary intended for the forming miſſionaries, and educating youth in religion and ſobriety of manners. The ſame objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lie againſt the neighbouring iſlands.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider the accounts given of their avarice and licentiouſneſs, their coldneſs in the practice of religion, and their averſion from propagating it, (which appears in the withholding their ſlaves from baptiſm) it is to be feared, that the inhabitants in the populous parts of our plantations on the continent are not much fitter, than thoſe in the iſlands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, to influence or aſſiſt ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. And as to the more remote and leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented parts, the difficulty of being ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with neceſſaries, the danger of being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the inroads of ſavages; and above all, the want of intercourſe with other places, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them improper ſituations for a ſeminary of religion and learning.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs to inſert here an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I remember to have ſeen in an abſtract of the proceedings, &amp;c. annexed to the Dean of Canterbury's ſermon, before the ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts; that the ſavage Indians, who live on the continent, will not ſuffer their children to learn Engliſh or Dutch, leſt they ſhould be debauched by converſing with their European neighbours; which is a melancholy, but ſtrong confirmation of the truth of what hath been now advanced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0563700800:9"/>
A general intercourſe and correſpondence with all the Engliſh colonies, both on the iſlands and the continent, and with other parts of America, hath been before laid down, as a neceſſary circumſtance, the reaſon whereof is very evident. But this circumſtance is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found. For on the continent, where there are neither inns, nor carriages, nor bridges over the rivers, there is no travelling by land between diſtant places. And the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſettlements are reputed to extend along the ſea-coaſt for the ſpace of fifteen hundred miles. It is therefore plain, there can be no convenient communication between them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by ſea; no advantage therefore, in this point, can be gained by ſettling on the continent.</p>
            <p>There is another conſideration, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually regards the continent and iſlands, that the general courſe of trade and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence lies from all thoſe colonies to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alone: Whereas, for our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it would be neceſſary to pitch upon a place, if ſuch could be found, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a conſtant intercourſe with all the other colonies, and whoſe commerce lies chiefly or altogether (not in Europe, but) in America.</p>
            <p>There is but one ſpot that I can find, to which, this circumſtance agrees: And that is the iſles of Bermuda, otherwiſe called the Summer Iſlands. Theſe having no rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity or manufacture, ſuch as ſugar, tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, or the like, wherewithal to trade to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, are obliged to become carriers for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, as the Dutch are for Europe. The Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudans are excellent ſhipwrights and ſailors,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0563700800:10"/>
and have a great number of very good ſloops, which are always paſſing and repaſſing from all parts of America. They drive a conſtant trade to the iſlands of Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antego, &amp;c, with butter, onions, cabbages, and other roots and vegetables, which they have in great plenty and perfection. They have alſo ſome ſmall manufactures of joyner's work and matting, which they export to the plantations on the continent. Hence Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan ſloops are oftner ſeen in the ports of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, than any other. And indeed, by the beſt information I could get, it appears they are the only people of all the Britiſh planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who hold a general correſpondence with the reſt.</p>
            <p>And, as the commerce of Bermuda renders it a very fit place, wherein to erect a ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo likewiſe doth its ſituation, it being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced between our plantations on the continent, and thoſe in the iſles, ſo as equally to reſpect both. To which may be added, that it lies in the way of veſſels paſſing from America to Great Britain; all which makes it plain, that the youth, to be educated in a ſeminary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Summer Iſlands, would have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities of going thither and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with their Friends. It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be owned, that ſome will be obliged to go a long way to any one place, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe reſorted to, from all parts of our plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but if we were to look out a ſpot the neareſt approaching to an equal diſtance from all the reſt, I believe it would be found to be Bermuda. It remains, that we ſee whether it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0563700800:11"/>
enjoys the other qualities or conditions laid down as well as this.</p>
            <p>The ſummer iſlands are ſituated near the latitude of thirty three degrees; no part of the world enjoys a purer air, or a more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climate, the great ocean which envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons them, at once moderating the heat of the ſouth winds and the ſeverity of the north weſt. Such a latitude on the continent might be thought too hot; but the air in Bermuda is perpetually fanned and kept cool by ſea-breezes, which renders the weather the moſt healthy and delightful that could be wiſhed, being, (as is affirmed by perſons, who have long lived there) of one equal tenour almoſt throughout the whole year, like the latter end of a fine May; inſomuch that it is reſorted to as the Montpelier of America.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe iſles leſs remarkable for plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than for health; there being, beſides beef, mutton, and fowl, great abundance of fruits, and garden-ſtuff of all kinds in perfection: To this, if we add the prodigious plenty and variety of excellent fiſh, which is every day taken on their coaſts, it would ſeem, that a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary could no where be ſupplied with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſions, or cheaper than here.</p>
            <p>About forty years ago, upon cutting down many tall cedars, that ſheltered their orange-trees from the north-weſt-wind (which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blows, even there, ſo as to affect that delicate plant) great part of their orange plantations ſuffered; but other cedars are ſince grown up, and no doubt a little induſtry would again produce as great plenty of oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as ever was there heretofore. I mention
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0563700800:12"/>
this, becauſe ſome have inferred from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſcarcity of that fruit, for which Bermuda was once ſo famous, that there hath been a change in the ſoil and climate for the worſe. But this, as hath been obſerved, proceeded from another cauſe, which is now in great meaſure taken away.</p>
            <p>Bermuda is a cluſter of ſmall iſlands, which lie in a very narrow compaſs, containing, in all, not quite twenty thouſand acres. This groupe of iſles is (to uſe Mr. Waller's expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) walled round with rocks, which render them inacceſſible to pyrates, or enemies; there being but two narrow entrances, both well guarded by forts. It would therefore be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find any where, a more ſecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for ſtudents.</p>
            <p>The trade of Bermuda conſiſts only in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-ſtuff, and ſome poor manufactures, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of cedar and the palmetto leaf. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muda hats are worn by our ladies: They are made of a ſort of mat, or (as they call it) platting made of the palmetto leaf, which is the only commodity that I can find exported from Bermuda to Great Britain; and as there is no proſpect of making a fortune by this ſmall trade, ſo it cannot be ſuppoſed to tempt the fellows of the college to engage in it, to the neglect of their peculiar buſineſs, which might poſſibly be the caſe elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Such as their trade is, ſuch is their wealth; the inhabitants being much poorer than the other colonies, who do not fail to deſpiſe them upon that account. But if they have leſs wealth, they have withal leſs vice and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive folly than their neighbours. They are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0563700800:13"/>
repreſented as a contented, plain, innocent ſort of people, free from avarice and luxury, as well as the other corruptions that attend thoſe vices.</p>
            <p>I am alſo informed, that they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendants on divine ſervice, more kind and reſpectful to their paſtor, (when they have one) and ſhew much more humanity to their ſlaves and charity to one another, than is obſerved among the Engliſh in the other plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: one reaſon of this may be, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned criminals, being employed in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of ſugar and tobacco, were never tranſported thither. But, whatever be the cauſe, the facts are atteſted by a Clergyman of good credit, who lived long among them.</p>
            <p>Among a people of this character, and in a ſituation thus circumſtantiated, it would ſeem that a religious ſeminary might very fitly be placed. The correſpondence with other parts of America, the goodneſs of the air, the plenty and ſecurity of the place, the frugality and innocence of the inhabitants, all conſpiring to favour ſuch a deſign. Thus much at leaſt is evident, that young ſtudents would be there leſs liable to be corrupted in their morals; and the governing part would be eaſier, and better contented with a ſmall ſtipend and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired academical life, in a corner from whence avarice and luxury are excluded, than they can be ſuppoſed to be in the midſt of a full trade and great riches, attended with all that high living and parade which our planters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and which, as well as all faſhionable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould be far removed from the eyes of the young American miſſionaries, who are to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0563700800:14"/>
lead a life of poverty and ſelf-denial among their countrymen.</p>
            <p>After all, it muſt be acknowledged, that though every thing elſe ſhould concur with our wiſhes, yet if a ſet of good governors and teachers be wanting, who are acquainted with the methods of education, and have the zeal and ability requiſite for carrying on a deſign of this nature, it would certainly come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>An inſtitution of this kind ſhould be ſet on foot by men of prudence, ſpirit, and zeal, as well as competent learning, who ſhould be led to it by other motives than the neceſſity of picking up a maintenance. For upon this view, what man of merit can be ſuppoſed to quit his native country, and take up with a poor college-ſubſiſtance in another part of the world, where there are ſo many conſiderable pariſhes actually void, and ſo many others ill ſupplied for want of fitting incumbents? Is it likely, that fellowſhips of forty or fifty pounds a year ſhould tempt abler or worthier men, than benefices of many times their value?</p>
            <p>And except able and worthy men do firſt engage in this affair, with a reſolution to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert themſelves in forming the manners of the youth, and giving them a proper education, it is evident the miſſion and the college will be but in a very bad way. This inconvenience ſeems the moſt difficult to provide againſt, and, if not provided againſt, it will be the moſt likely to obſtruct any deſign of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So true it is, that where ignorance or ill manners once take place in a ſeminary, they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0563700800:15"/>
are ſure to be handed down in a ſucceſſion of illiterate or worthleſs men.</p>
            <p>There are many inſtances of this in the Jeſuite's colleges throughout Italy, where the nobleſt foundations and the fineſt genius's in the world are quite loſt by a wrong turn and taſt in the regents. And to come nearer our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, the ſame may be obſerved in the two presbyterian colleges of New England, which have ſo long ſubſiſted to little or no purpoſe, if we may believe the accounts that are given of them. <hi>See Britiſh empire in America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this apprehenſion, which ſeems ſo well grounded, that a college in any part of America would either lie unprovided, or be worſe provided than their churches are, hath no place in Bermuda; there being at this time ſeveral gentlemen, in all reſpects very well qualified, and in poſſeſſion of good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and fair proſpects at home, who having ſeriouſly conſidered the great benefit that may ariſe to the church and to mankind from ſuch an undertaking, are ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in it, and to dedicate the remainder of their lives to the inſtructing the youth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, and proſecuting their own ſtudies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very moderate ſubſiſtence in a retirement, ſo ſweet, and ſo ſecure, and every way ſo well fitted for a place of education, and ſtudy, as Bermuda.</p>
            <p>Thus much the writer hereof thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to ſay of his aſſociates: For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he can only ſay, that as he values no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment upon earth, ſo much as that of being employed in the execution of this deſign; ſo he hopes to make up for other defects, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and zeal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0563700800:16"/>
In Europe, the proteſtant religion hath of late years conſiderably loſt ground, and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſeems the likelieſt place, wherein to make up for what hath been loſt in Europe, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the proper methods are taken: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Spaniſh miſſionaries in the South, and the French in the North, are making ſuch a progreſs, as may one day ſpread the religion of Rome, and with it the uſual hatred to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, throughout all the ſavage nations in America; which would probably end in the utter extirpation of our colonies, on the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereof depends ſo much of the nation's wealth, and ſo conſiderable a branch of his majeſty's revenue.</p>
            <p>But if this ſcheme were purſued, it would in all probability have much greater influence on the Americans, than the utmoſt endeavours of popiſh emiſſaries can poſſibly have; who from the difference of country, language and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, muſt lie under far greater difficulties and diſcouragements than thoſe, whom we ſuppoſe yearly ſent out from Bermuda to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their countrymen.</p>
            <p>It cannot indeed be denied, that the great number of poor regulars inured to hard living, and brought up in an implicit obedience to their ſuperiors, hath hitherto given the church of Rome, in regard to her miſſions, great advantage over the reformed churches. But from what hath been ſaid, it is, I think, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this advantage may be over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by our employing American miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>Nor is the honour of the crown, nation, and church of England unconcerned in this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0563700800:17"/>
ſcheme; which, it is to be hoped, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the reproach, we have ſo long lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that we fall as far ſhort of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Romiſh communion in zeal for propagating religion, as we ſurpaſs them in the ſoundneſs and purity of it. And at the ſame time, that the doing what may be ſo eaſily done, takes away our reproach; it will caſt no ſmall luſtre on his majeſty's reign, and derive a bleſſing from heaven on his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoſe who live under the influence thereof.</p>
            <p>Men of narrow minds have a peculiar ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at objection, being never at a loſs for ſomething to ſay againſt whatſoever is not of their own propoſing. And perhaps, it will be ſaid in oppoſition to this propoſal, that if we thought ourſelves capable of gaining converts to the church, we ought to begin with papiſts, infidels, and diſſenters of all denominations at home, and to make proſelytes of theſe, before we think of foreigners; and that therefore our ſcheme is againſt duty. And further, that conſidering the great oppoſition, which is ſound on the part of thoſe, who differ from us at home, no ſucceſs can be expected among ſavages abroad, and that therefore it is againſt reaſon and experience.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this I ſay, that religion like light is imparted without being diminiſhed. That whatever is done abroad, can be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance or let to the converſion of infidels and diſſenters at home. That thoſe who engage in this affair, imagine they will not be miſſed, where there is no want of ſchools or clergy; but that they may be of ſingular ſervice in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0563700800:18"/>
countries, but thinly ſupplied with either, or altogether deprived of both: That our colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, being of the ſame blood, language, and religion with ourſelves, are in effect our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. But that chriſtian charity, not being limited by thoſe regards, doth extend to all mankind. And this may ſerve for an anſwer to the firſt point, that our deſign is againſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond point I anſwer; that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not ſo incurable as error; that you muſt pull down as well as build, eraſe as well as imprint, in order to make proſelytes at home: Whereas, the ſavage Americans, if they are in a ſtate purely natural and unimpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by education, they are alſo unincumbred with all that rubbiſh of ſuperſtition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which is the effect of a wrong one. As they are leſs inſtructed, they are withal leſs conceited, and more teachable. And not being violently attached to any falſe ſyſtem of their own, are ſo much the fitter to receive that which is true. Hence it is evident, that ſucceſs abroad ought not to be meaſured by that which we obſerve at home, and that the inference, which was made from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the one to the impoſſibility of the other, is altogether groundleſs.</p>
            <p>It is moſt true, notwithſtanding our preſent corruptions, that there are to be found in no country under the ſun men of better inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or greater abilities for doing good than in England. But it is as true, that ſucceſs, in many caſes, dependeth not upon zeal, induſtry, wealth, learning, or the like faculties, ſo much as on the method, wherein theſe are applied.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0563700800:19"/>
We often ſee a ſmall proportion of labour and expence in one way, bring that about, which in others a much greater ſhare of both could never effect. It hath been my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſcover this way or method in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe. What hath been done, I ſubmit to the judgment of all good and reaſonable men; who, I am perſuaded, will never reject or diſcourage a propoſal of this nature on the ſcore of ſlight objections, ſurmiſes, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and thereby render themſelves charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the having prevented thoſe good effects, which might otherwiſe have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it.</p>
            <p>For it is, after all, poſſible, that unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen difficulties may ariſe in the proſecution of this deſign, many things may retard, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things may threaten to obſtruct it; but there is hardly any enterprize or ſcheme what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever for the publick good, in which difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not often ſhewing themſelves, and as often overcome by the bleſſing of God, upon the prudence and reſolution of the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: though, for ought that appears, the preſent ſcheme is as likely to ſucceed, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with as few difficulties, as any of this kind can poſſibly be.</p>
            <p>For to any man, who conſiders the divine power of religion, the innate force of reaſon and virtue, and the mighty effects often wrought by the conſtant regular operation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a weak and ſmall cauſe; it will ſeem natural and reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that rivulets perpetually iſſuing forth from a fountain, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoir, of learning and religion, and ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' all parts of America, muſt in due
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0563700800:20"/>
time have a great effect, in purging away the ill manners and irreligion of our colonies, as well as the blindneſs and barbarity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round them: Eſpecially, if the reſervoir be in a clean and private place, where its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, out of the way of any thing that may diſturb or muddy them, remain clear and pure: Otherwiſe, they are more likely to pollute than purify the places through which they flow.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who wiſh well to religion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, will need no other motive to forward an undertaking calculated for the ſervice of both: I ſhall, nevertheleſs, beg leave to obſerve, that whoever would be glad to cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins by an extenſive and well judged charity, or whoever, from an excellent and godlike temper of mind, ſeeks opportunities of doing good in his generation, will be pleaſed to meet with a ſcheme that ſo peculiarly puts it in his power, with ſmall trouble or expence, to procure a great and laſting benefit to the world.</p>
            <p>Ten pounds a year, would (if I miſtake not) be ſufficient to defray the expence of a young American in the college of Bermuda, as to dyet, lodging, cloaths, books, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And if ſo, the intereſt of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds may be a perpetual fund for maintaining one miſſionary at the college for ever; and in this ſucceſſion, many, it is to be hoped, may become powerful inſtruments for converting to chriſtianity and civil life whole nations, who now ſit in darkneſs and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, and whoſe cruel brutal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are a diſgrace to human nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0563700800:21"/>
A benefaction of this kind ſeems to enlarge the very being of a man, extending it to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant places and to future times; inaſmuch as unſeen countries, and after ages, may feel the effects of his bounty, while he himſelf reaps the reward in the bleſſed ſociety of all thoſe, who, <hi>having turned many to righteouſneſs, ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi>
