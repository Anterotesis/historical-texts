            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Hours of Meditation, when the Mind was on its reſearches for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs to the following Petit Drama, I was not long at a loſs for One to whom I might with propriety pay my reſpects. The very conſpicuous figure you have made upon the Stage, brought your Merits to my view, and from thoſe I thought there could be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in my laying this Trifle at your feet. The tutelary Siſters, Melpomene and Thalia, who preſide over all the Scenic Arts, have taken you by the hand and placed you on a pedeſtal ſo high, that Envy lowers her ſcowling front whene'er ſhe caſts her jaundiced Eye upon your exalted Station, for you juſtly aſſimulate the pathetic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the one, and faſcinate with the
<pb facs="tcp:0751700700:4"/>
bewitching archneſs of the other. This perhaps may look like flattery, but thoſe who know me, know <hi>that flattery is a talent which I never yet poſſeſſed,</hi> and, for the want of which, perhaps I may have hatched ſome Snakes and Scorpions who have endeavoured to breathe their venom upon the bloſſoms of my reputation. In the preſent inſtance certain malevolant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petiters attempted to ſting my riſing hopes and diſconcert the eminent and arduous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of the Performers, to whom I am ſo much indebted on this Piece's firſt aſſay;—yet I had the ſatisfaction to ſee it baffle all their Spleen, and now, Madam, I ſubmit it to the APPROBATION of the PUBLIC, and hope it will receive your PROTECTION.</p>

            <p>THE PRINTER begs leave to obſerve that the Reviewers of Theatricals in the MORNING HERALD and other reſpectable PRINTS, who ſaw the Repreſentation as well as the Editors of the LONDON, EUROPEAN, NEW LADY'S, and other MAGAZINES, have ſpoken of this New Piece in very Reſpectful Terms. <q rend="inline">"That it is replete with wit, whim, and good humour, and exhibits a well timed ſatire on the bent of fanciful individuals, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating that <hi>Every Man</hi> has his <hi>Hobby,</hi> and that all mankind, are, at ſome period of Life or other, the <hi>Dupes of Fancy.</hi> Upon the whole they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this Farce to ſurpaſs mediocrity, and that its merits juſtly deſerve that kind reception from the Public which it has experienced."</q> The Author is well known to the world by his Lectures on Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micry, Imitations, and other humourous writings;
<pb facs="tcp:0751700700:6"/>
and all lovers of dramatic productions and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in general will be highly gratified by a ſight and peruſal of this Comic Piece.</p>
            <p>On it's firſt appearance at the Hay Market, ſome objections were made to it's <hi>length,</hi> particularly in the Dinner Scene, but by the Author's Judicious curtailment for future Repreſentation, every objection of this kind will be obviated. It is however printed as originally written, and ſuch parts of it marked as were omitted in the repreſentation. It is preſumed it will be performed this Summer, at many of the Watering Places throughout the Kingdom, and that it will be brought forward with ſome amendment and alteration next Seaſon at the King's Theatre.</p>
