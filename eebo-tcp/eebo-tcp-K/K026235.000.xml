            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE preſent ſituation of Public Affairs
calls forcibly upon every good Subject,
to exert himſelf in the Public Service. Every
individual poſſeſſes a power, which can aid and
ſupport his country. He can draw his ſword in
her defence, contribute to her reſources, or
combat with argument, and expoſe to juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
thoſe, who have proved themſelves
her internal, and conſequently, her unnatural
enemies.</p>
            <p>The Author of the following Eſſay has long
entertained an opinion, that the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
foes of Great Britain were nurſed in her
own boſom: Theſe, under the maſque of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm,
fomented rebellion in her Colonies; and
by expoſing her pretended weakneſs, created a
combination of powerful States, not only againſt
her intereſt, but her very exiſtence, as a great
and independent Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the emergency, which is the reſult of that
combination, two objects ſeem neceſſary to the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0176902600:3"/>
Public Safety. Theſe are, the knowledge of
our friends from our enemies; and that ſpirited
exertion, which alone can extricate us, from our
preſent ſituation. If the facts advanced, and
encouragements exhibited, in the following Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
ſhall contribute to throw light, on the one;
or to add vigour to the other, the Writer has
attained his purpoſe.</p>

            <head>A SHORT
HISTORY
OF THE
OPPOSITION.</head>
            <p>IN every age, and almoſt in every country,
the ambition, which is inherent in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
has prompted individuals to aſpire to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
and pre-eminence, among their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens.
The means, uſed to obtain thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
are various; as to render them ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
they muſt be accommodated to the ſpirit
of the government, under which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
In deſpotic monarchies, the favour of
the Prince, who is the fountain of all prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is generally procured by intrigue or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.
In republics, influence and authority
are acquired, by gaining the confidence, or by
ſeducing the principles of the people; and, in
mixed governments, like that of Great Britain,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0176902600:5"/>
the neareſt road to power lies between thoſe two
extremes.</p>
            <p>The Revolution, which happened about
ninety years ago, though it made but few
changes in the forms of authority, eſtabliſhed a
balance of influence, between the Crown and the
People. The firſt retained the eſſence, but loſt
much of the terror of power. The repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the latter having a great deal to beſtow,
as a body, thought themſelves, as individuals,
entitled to a ſhare in a government, which they
ſupported. A mutual dependence was created,
by the poſſeſſion of the means of conferring mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
favours. A Prince, who ſtood in need of
ſupplies, was directed, by common prudence,
where to chuſe his ſervants. But as candidates
were more numerous than offices, the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
never failed to perſecute the ſucceſsful,
till, by watching faults, errors, or misfortunes,
they obtained their point, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
became, in their turn, the objects of
attack.</p>
            <p>As a degree of the public confidence was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to direct the Sovereign in his choice of
ſervants, men who wiſhed to be employed, took
care to ſupport, in their public appearances,
the principles and perhaps the prejudices of
the people. An habitual jealouſy of the power
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0176902600:6"/>
of the Crown, kept open the ears of the public
to every alarm. Scarce any meaſure of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
could be ſo free from error, as not
to be vulnerable on ſome popular ground.
Every Oppoſition ſeized this obvious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and aſſumed or obtained the title of "the
popular party." No diſtinction was made,
in this reſpect, between <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory.</hi> Each
party, when out of place, adopted the ſame
principles; and thus both were alternately
dignified with the once honourable name of
PATRIOTS.</p>
            <p>The preſent reign began, with advantages,
calculated to put an end to fooliſh diſtinctions,
which ought to have expired, with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
on which they had been founded. A
young prince had ſucceeded to the throne, who
diſdained to govern his people through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
of a faction. The door of preferment
was laid open to all his ſubjects; but though
this liberal conduct might have pleaſed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced,
it was incapable of extinguiſhing
party among the intereſted. Theſe, though of
different principles and characters, by impoſing
on the weak and credulous, formed new factions,
on the ſhadows of departed political tenets.
However heterogeneous before, the heat of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
and rage of diſappointment, as it
were, gradually melted them into one maſs;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0176902600:7"/>
and they revived in themſelves the name, though
little of the principles of WHIGS.</p>
            <p>The vehemence of the preſent Oppoſition
ſeems to have carried them to extremities,
which ſuperſede all former deſcriptions of party,
and which cannot fail to defeat their views. In
former times, the candidates for public favour
thought it prudent to adhere, in their exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to public principles. But in our times,
an eagerneſs to thwart the meaſures of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has expelled all regard for the opinions of
the people. The dignity and honour of the
nation were formerly the favourite themes of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
melancholy, meanneſs, and deſpair,
now fill the whole circle of patriotic oratory.
With a want of prudence, as well as of decency,
they tie up the hands of their country in the
hour of danger. They not only juſtify rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
againſt her authority, but indirectly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a foreign war againſt her very exiſtence:
By magnifying the power of her opponents,
they endeavour to depreſs her ſpirits; by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
her real or pretended weakneſs, they
wiſh to inſpire her enemies with a confidence of
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtrange poſitions, and many more of
the ſame kind, might be eſtabliſhed, on incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible
authorities, by a plain narrative of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0176902600:8"/>
conduct of oppoſition, ſince the commencement
of the preſent parliament. But, the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them through ſuch a variety of matter,
and ſuch a length of time, would be a taſk
of great labour, and little entertainment. We
ſhall, therefore, confine ourſelves to the moſt
ſtriking features of the laſt ſeſſion. In the
ſpace of ſeven months, they have contrived to
croud together moſt of the abſurdities of ſeven
years; and, though the ſtudied brevity of this
diſquiſition muſt neceſſarily exclude many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
enough, we truſt, will appear to
ſhew the principles, deſigns, and views of ſo
ſtrange a confederacy.</p>
            <p>On the 26th of November, 1778, the fifth
ſeſſion of the preſent parliament was opened,
with a ſpeech from the throne. A complaint
of the perfidy of France, in commencing hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and the obſtinacy of America, in refuſing
terms, together with a requeſt of ſupport, were
the chief heads of the ſpeech. It expreſſed, at
the ſame time, a regret "that the efforts of
his Majeſty had not been attended with all
the ſucceſs which the juſtice of the cauſe, and
the vigour of exertions, ſeemed to promiſe."
Unanimity was, in the uſual form, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and ſurely no period in hiſtory more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the unanimous exertion of the whole
nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0176902600:9"/>
Oppoſition have denominated themſelves
"an active Oppoſition;" and if zeal in thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
aſſiduity in obſtructing, and ſucceſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
public meaſures, merit a deſignation,
which implies a kind of applauſe, they are
certainly entitled to that name. The una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
and concert, which their Sovereign
requeſted, for the ſupport of the intereſts
and honour of the nation, exiſt only among
them, for the ruin of the one, and the tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the other. A ſhort detail of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which they advanced in the firſt exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſeaſon, will eſtabliſh the truth of
this obſervation. The orators in the Lower
Houſe mixed reflections on the paſt, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of future diſaſters. The firſt we ſhall
ſubmit to the judgment of the Reader; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the latter have been already refuted by
time.</p>
            <p>Oppoſition opened the political campaign,
with aſſertions, which had been often refuted;
and with predictions of national diſaſters, which
their own conduct ſeemed, uniformly, calculated
to realize. As the public misfortunes may be
deduced, from the rebellion in America, they
aſſerted, contrary to fact, that hoſtilities had
been firſt commenced by government. They
recurred to their uſual prophecies, relative to
foreign wars; and they even went ſo far as to arm
Holland, our ancient ally, againſt this devoted

the army and navy, they aſſerted that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had employed no commander of an army,

or with whom they had not quarrelled<note n="c" place="bottom">Speech of C. F<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

With a contradiction in terms, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that Miniſtry had ſucceeded in <hi>no inſtance</hi>;
yet that fortune had been favourable in <hi>every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
during the whole campaign<note n="d" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. They

            <p>Though the clogging the wheels of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

riſe and progreſs of the American war, they
traced the cauſe of the war to the pretended ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny

continued an atrocious rebellion for many years,

againſt her parent and benefactreſs; yet they
affirmed, that a war againſt America "is

With unexampled abſurdity, they alleged,

            <p>Aſſertions, which carried along with them
their own refutation, were not likely to make
converts within, nor proſelytes without doors.
But what the party could not effect by facts
and arguments, they endeavoured to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh,
by addreſs and intrigue. Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a conſequent want of ſuceeſs, on
every ſide of the war, had convinced the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there was an error in planning at
home, or a defect in the execution abroad.
Generals and Admirals had returned, from
their different commands, not only without
laurels, but ſome of them covered with diſgrace
or misfortune. The coldneſs, with which they
had been received, by their country, had raiſed
their reſentment, as it hurt their pride. As Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
brought forward no accuſation againſt
them, the preſumption was, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were partly to blame. As men of little
prudence and conſiderable names, are the fitteſt

care to ſecure engines, which they hoped to
play off with advantage, on the enemy.</p>

that he came from America, where he

Terentius Varro returned to Rome, from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
fields of Cannae. Men, in general, have
leſs blamed his conduct abroad, than his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
at home. His accepting a leave of abſence
from a Congreſs, who had ſhamefully evaded
hs own convention, the remembrance of recent
misfortunes, and a ſuſpicion of former errors,
juſtified the court, in adhering to an <hi>etiquette,</hi>
which excludes officers, who have been unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
from the Royal Preſence, till they are
acquitted by a Court Martial.</p>
            <p>The General forgot his own errors, if ſuch
exiſted, and remembered only, what he thought,
the ſeverity of Government. He alſo forgot,
that he had left his captive fellow-ſoldiers,
whom he ought to have protected from inſult
and oppreſſion, by his preſence; and he even,
eluded orders given him to return to their aid,
in their melancholy and ſevere captivity. It was
obſerved, upon the whole, that regret and pity
were all he could hope to meet with; but,
it ſeems, he expected approbation. Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
aroſe, in his mind, as from injuſtice;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0176902600:15"/>

but as he had deciſively improved no advantage,
the American war rather increaſed, than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,

<hi>routine</hi> of military knowledge, he ſeems to
have been capable of ſecuring from defeat <hi>ſuch</hi>
troops as <hi>be</hi> led againſt <hi>ſuch</hi> an enemy: But
the conducting them to any brilliant victory,
and the making a deciſive uſe of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
he enjoyed, appear to have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
foreign to his talents. Senſible, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
of this defect, in his own mind, he choſe
to prevent any reverie of fortune by retiring
from the command of the army; but as "mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
ſeceſſions," in the midſt of war, require
an explanation, his retreat was aſcribed to his
having loſt the confidence of men in power.
The fact might be true, but it was not ſufficient,
to ſatisfy the people. Though he was received
with kindneſs by the Sovereign, and attention
by the Miniſtry, he perceived that he was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
faſt from the memory of the nation.
In the ſpace of a few months, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of as little account, in the eſtimation
of the Public, as any of his own commiſſaries;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0176902600:16"/>
and, to recover his reputation, he cloſed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly,
with Oppoſition; as they promiſed him
their hearty aſſiſtance, in a Parliamentary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>To theſe lucky aids from America, the party
added a ſtill greater acquiſition in Europe. An
Admiral poſſeſſed of profeſſional reputation,
equal at leaſt to his merit, though connected
with Oppoſition, was placed at the head of the
Weſtern Squadron. The ſelecting men of <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi>
principles, for the command of fleets and
armies, has been long a favourite maxim of
Government. This conduct may have had its
foundation in liberal ſentiments; but it has ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
like weakneſs, and led to a train of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
Few officers are ſuch "ſturdy mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,"
as to exclude political prejudices from
the line of their duty.</p>
            <p>Our Admiral put to ſea, with one of the
moſt powerful ſquadrons, that ever ſailed, from
the ports of this kingdom. He met the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and a running fight, rather than an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
enſued. No trophies were loſt; but
no laurels were gained. The profeſſional terms,
in which the accounts of naval actions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
render them obſcure, if not unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0176902600:17"/>
to the generality of mankind. One
fact, however, was univerſally admitted: "A
ſuperior Britiſh fleet had engaged an inferior
French ſquadron; and neither advantage nor
trophy was obtained."</p>
            <p>A nation, accuſtomed to value themſelves
upon naval victories, were not likely to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with a drawn battle, under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
But though no ſymptoms of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appeared, no ſigns of reſentment were
ſhown. A cold ſilence certainly prevailed; a
ſpecies of cenſure, more mortifying to a feeling
mind, than even clamour. Had the Admiral
been permitted to remain, under this cloud, he
would have become a uſeleſs engine, in the
hands of his party. To derive benefit from his
former popularity, it was found neceſſary to
remove the ſtain, which want of ſucceſs had left
upon his character. Some officers, in his ſuite,
were, accordingly, induced to propagate inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,
to the diſadvantage of Vice-Admiral
Sir H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> P<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>r. That gentleman, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in place, might be ſuppoſed to act in
concert with men in power, for the ruin of his
Admiral; and to make the former the <hi>accuſer</hi>
was to arm the prejudices of the people in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0176902600:18"/>
The Vice Admiral being a man of more ſpirit
than foreſight, unfortunately fell into the trap
laid for him by the faction. Conſcious of his
deſerving praiſe, inſtead of cenſure, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
on the 27th of July, he became irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
at the injuſtice done to his reputation.
From being the <hi>accuſed,</hi> he became the <hi>accuſer</hi>;
and this ſtep turned the ſcale of opinion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his opponent. In this circumſtance
alone the gallant Vice-Admiral, as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appeared, was to blame. Had he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and inſiſted upon his own trial, his
character would have recovered its deſerved
luſtre; and that of the Admiral might have loſt
much of that ſplendour which was thrown upon
it, by his induſtrious friends.</p>
            <p>A party, who had loſt the confidence of the
nation, ſeized with eagerneſs the ſudden change
which appeared in the popular tide. Whiſpers
artfully propagated, without doors, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by degrees into a general clamour.
Within doors, every opportunity was taken, and
every artifice uſed to feed the riſing flame. The
two Admirals, if a vulgar expreſſion may be
uſed, were <hi>pitted</hi> againſt each other. Much
ſport, or what is the ſame thing to Oppoſition,
much miſchief, was expected from this conteſt.
A man of popularity was accuſed, by a man
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0176902600:19"/>
in office. The common changes of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
interference were rung, without ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the ears of the people. The helpleſs
condition of INNOCENCE, when perſecuted by
POWER, was echoed, from every corner, by
the runners, writers, and abettors of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The two houſes of Parliament reſounded
with vehement declamations, or broken accents
of whining oratory; and that amiable but much
abuſed virtue, pity, was excited, every where,
in the breaſts of the deluded, the credulous and
the weak.</p>
            <p>In vain had Sir H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r declared, in
the moſt ſolemn and public manner, that he
had not communicated his deſign to any man in
office. In vain did men in office affirm, upon
the faith of Gentlemen, that they knew nothing
of the accuſation, till it was officially delivered
to the Admiralty. No credit was to be given to
any member of a <hi>Tory</hi> Adminiſtration. They
were leagued together in one plan of oppreſſion,
in one dark deſign, in one pre-concerted conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
to ruin the reputation, and even to take
the life, of a <hi>Whig</hi> Admiral.</p>
            <p>In this general turmoil, this intemperate
joy of faction, Oppoſition not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
their poor country, but even their poor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0176902600:20"/>

their promiſed ſupport, for a moment, with all

than the benefits to be drived from the

Their abrogating the old forms of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
by removing a trial for a naval offence
to the land, to accommodate their own purpoſes,
their appearance at Portſmouth, upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
their biaſſing witneſſes, their carrying all
the indecencies of a play-houſe audience into a
Court of Juſtice, their ſoliciting the officers of
the navy, their ſowing diſcontents among the
common ſeamen, their parading the ſtreets, for
the purpoſe of inflaming the populace, were
ſuch mean, ſcandalous, and unjuſtifiable tricks
of faction, as can ſcarcely be paralleled by any
example in hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The pitiful victory which they obtained over
an unfortunate, becauſe a vehement, man, was
purſued with an intemperance inexcuſable even
in boys, and with a rancour which the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
and hard-hearted men, if prudent, would
have concealed, to preſerve, at leaſt, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of decency. That men of the firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
in this country, ſhould diſguiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
like porters to force illuminations by
breaking windows, is a circumſtance which
throws an indelible ſtain upon the times, as
well as on the party. It even appeared, that,
with every inclination to commit miſchief, the
riotous demagogues were obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the bottle, for that courage which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0176902600:22"/>
had denied. That in the hour of "intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and adſcititious boldneſs," they attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the feeble and old among the men, and
terrified into fits and miſcarriages ſeveral wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
by the rude barbarity of their behaviour.
That, however, as a juſt retribution for their
wanton cruelties, many of them ſuffered under
the hands and cudgels of the injured; and that
ſeveral were carried into Roundhouſes, covered
with ignominious marks of the chaſtiſement they
had received.</p>
            <p>Few men of ſenſe, who were not connected
with the views, or privy to the deſigns of the
party, could perceive any juſt grounds for this
ſpecies of vulgar ovation. Though the <hi>accuſer</hi>
had not brought his charges to the ſtandard of
legal proof, the <hi>accuſed</hi> had not exculpated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the ſatisfaction of the public. Thoſe who
were moſt willing to deny his want of conduct,
regretted his want of good fortune; and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
cry went forth, that an opportunity was
loſt, which might never return again.</p>
            <p>The conduct of the Admiral himſelf, on the
occaſion, was not calculated to eſtabliſh any
high idea of his good ſenſe or of his principles.
If he thought that he merited a triumph for the
drawn battle of the 27th of July, 1778, what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0176902600:23"/>
are we to think of his underſtanding? If, on
the other hand, he made himſelf the tool of a
faction, what judgment muſt we form of that
"dignified honour" which his friends annex to
his character? A victory, which had lain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
for ſeven months, and was, at length,
diſcovered by accident, was not, intrinſically,
worth the expence of many candles; and the
applauſe of a mob is the coarſeſt commodity
either a gentleman or his friends can purchaſe.</p>
            <p>But the Faction, as well as their naval friend,
acted as if they really gave credit to their own
aſſertions and aſſumptions. Whilſt HE paraded
the ſtreets amidſt the fooliſh, if not hired, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of a rabble, THEY were buſy in
weaving a wreath, for his brows, in both
Houſes of Parliament. Thinking, at length,
they had ſufficiently charged the engine with
popularity, they reſolved to bring it to bear,
not only upon Adminiſtration, but upon their
Sovereign. <hi>They</hi> propoſed to make motions,
againſt the former, on naval ſubjects; <hi>he</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
with peculiar modeſty, to write <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi>
to the latter. Even before this double

In ſupport of the motion, he alleged, that the

That, notwithſtanding this aſſertion, there
were not ſix ſhips of the line, in a ſtate to meet
an enemy, in the month of March 1778.
That early in the month of June, his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

of France, with twenty ſhips of the line only;
though it was known, or ought to have been

            <p>In oppoſition to theſe aſſertions, it was proved,

fit for meeting an enemy in June, amounted
to forty-four. That when Mr. K<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

which a large proportion was three-deckers, there
were but ſeventeen ſhips in the harbour of Breſt
ready for action. That ſhould it even appear,
which was by no means the caſe, that there
actually was a greater number of ſhips in Breſt,
it was well known to ſeamen, that an inferior
force may block up a ſuperior one in a narrow
harbour. That, upon the whole, the Board of
Admiralty had placed a number of ſhips, ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
to the ſervice, under the command of

            <p>Such were the aſſertions, which Oppoſition,
mixed with much abuſe and altercation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly
echoed, from ſide to ſide, in both
Houſes. Though the public, as well as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
are frequently invited to an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of politics, by ſome very <hi>eloquent</hi> Patriots,
the diſh ſerved up is always the ſame. To uſe
their own expreſſion, "they have travelled ſo
often over the ground," that they have trod
out every appearance of vegetation; and thoſe
who are ſo idle as to accompany them in the
"dreary journey," can neither expect amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor reap advantage.</p>
            <p>The operations of the party, <hi>without</hi> doors,
were more deciſive than their arguments <hi>within.</hi>
Confident of ſucceſs, or aſſuming the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of confidence, they had previouſly gained
the votes of ſeveral provident members, who
<hi>wiſely</hi> look into futurity. Lazy Whigs and
expecting patriots were roundly told, that to
ſhare in the ſpoil it was neceſſary to take an
active part in obtaining the victory. Mandates
were iſſued for the immediate appearance of all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0176902600:27"/>
abſentees, from every corner of the kingdom.
The beds of the ſick, the couches of the gouty
and lame were viſited; leaders were ſent to the
blind. In ſhort, patriotiſm crowded the lobbies
of both Houſes, with all the mortifying pictures
of age, misfortune and diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>To aid, with a ſpecies of mutiny among ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the attacks of Oppoſition upon Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
the ſeeds of ſedition had been ſown with a
laviſh hand at Portſmouth. Officers had been
attacked through their ruling paſſions; the vain
with flattery, the weak with fallacious reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and the avaricious and ambitious with
promiſes. To add indecency to preſumption
and folly, the nation was <hi>threatened,</hi> with what
is vulgarly called a <hi>Round Robin,</hi> from every
ſeaport. An Admiral, who had made ſuch a
<hi>ſplendid</hi> figure on the 27th of July, 1778,
dared to ſay to his ſovereign, that he would
withdraw his talents from the ſervice, unleſs the
Admiralty, and every department of the State,
were placed in the hands of men whom he
could truſt.</p>
            <p>Oppoſition drove, with ſo much rapidity and
ſo little judgment, that they overturned their
own deſigns. Their mean, and even criminal
conduct, offended the people; and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0176902600:28"/>
with becoming dignity, rejected their
inſolent requiſitions. The current turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and their ſpirit vaniſhed when their
hopes declined. The nation diſcovered their
inſidious deſigns, their luſt for power, their
thirſt for places. It was perceived that they
meant to ſacrifice Great Britain, her rights, her
intereſts, and even honour, to the demagogues
of America, by rendering her independent of
the parent from whom ſhe ſprung. Even thoſe
who had been ſeduced by their aſſurances, or
gained by their promiſes, finding their miſtake,
began to retreat. The friends whom they had
brought from the country, by a ſpecies of
<hi>habeas corpus,</hi> packed up their cloak-bags and
left the town. The beds of the ſick, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the lame, were re-occupied; and even
the blind found their way home. Ad<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

executed his threats againſt his <hi>devoted</hi> country,
by quitting her ſervice. The muddy ſtream,
which had overflowed the whole kingdom, and
covered it with ſlime, returned to its old bed;
and babbled, as formerly, through the rugged
channel of Oppoſition<note n="c" place="bottom">The <hi>Gazette de France, du Vendredi</hi> 26 <hi>Mars</hi> 1779,

The hopes of the Faction had been raiſed ſo
high, that diſappointment depreſſed their
minds in proportion to their former elevation.
Some, who either ignorantly or fondly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the nation would take their part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to talk of a ſeceſſion. A few orators are
ſaid to have actually retired, to vent the tropes
of unfiniſhed ſpeeches to the "echo of trees
and murmur of rills" on ſome friend's
eſtate.<note n="d" place="bottom">A certain Baronet, who in a fit of deſpair relative

            <p>Whilſt the expectations of Oppoſition were
at their height, by the aid received from A<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l

               </gap>l's acquittal, a new topic was ſtarted,
which, as it promiſed much miſchief to their
country, opened a freſh proſpect of advantage
to the party. The trade of Ireland, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
its revenue, had been on the decline
for ſome years paſt. The cauſes of that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
are more difficult to aſcertain than the
fact itſelf. Whether this diminution of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0176902600:30"/>
proceeded from a decreaſe of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
induſtry, or a failure of foreign markets,
it equally demanded a remedy, if it could be
applied. Some ſteps had been accordingly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
toward that object, in the preceding
ſeſſion. But it appeared, at the time, that the
facility with which relief was granted, inſtead
of ſatisfying Oppoſition, was calculated to
create new demands. Theſe demands, as they
interfered with the commerce of Great Britain,
were certain of being oppoſed: a circumſtance,
which could not fail to create the <hi>deſirable</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
which ſuits the views of the party.</p>
            <p>To thoſe, who really wiſhed to remove the
evil, it appeared that the Iriſh legiſlature ought
to be the beſt judges of the remedy. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that legiſlature, nor their conſtituents, had
ſignified any diſſatisfaction at the relief obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
To convince both of the impropriety of
their <hi>peaceable</hi> conduct, Oppoſition, by making
demands in the name of Ireland, pointed out
what ſhe might extort from Great Britain.
This artifice, they hoped, would reduce the
Miniſtry to a diſagreeable dilemma. Should
they grant the demanded relief to the Iriſh,
they could not fail to offend the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial
intereſt in great Britain: ſhould they
refuſe it, there was a proſpect, by proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0176902600:31"/>
of creating tumults, and, perhaps,
of kindling a rebellion in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Though this commercial adventure has not
yet been productive of all the profit expected
by the Faction, as the ſhip is ſtill at ſea, the
cargo may turn out to ſome account. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Iriſh are, and have been in a diſtreſſed
ſituation. The nature of the government, the
tenures of the country, a liſtleſs inactivity,
which always accompanies diſtreſs, a want of
induſtry, created by domeſtic diſcouragements
of various kinds, have combined to render
their condition more wretched than that of
almoſt any other in Europe. They have long
felt their own miſery, without knowing well
from whence it came. Our worthy Patriots,
by pointing out Great Britain as the author
of Iriſh diſtreſs, may have ſome chance of rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Iriſh reſentment. They have fomented
and encouraged reſiſtance in America, and
why may they not excite rebellion in Ireland?
The truth is, they ſeem to have injured their
country beyond <hi>their</hi> degree of forgiveneſs;
and if they cannot ſatisfy their ambition by
her misfortunes, they are at leaſt reſolved to
gratify their reſentment by her ruin.</p>
            <p>The attacks, in both Houſes were ſo ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
in manner, aſſertion, declamation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0176902600:32"/>
that it was apparent every meaſure had
been weighed and pre-concerted in the cabinet
of ſedition without doors. In this political war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
the poſt of honour was given to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
of the Lower Aſſembly, where the enemy
was ſuppoſed to be moſt vulnerable. After the
battle was loſt <hi>below,</hi> it was generally rehearſed
<hi>above</hi>; where ſome noble orators wielded, with
peculiar dexterity, thoſe very weapons of ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and invective, which had ſo little availed the
cauſe in the hands of their more humble friends.</p>
            <p>In the ſlighteſt ſkirmiſhes, with the common
enemy, the ſame co-operation, the ſame concert
appeared. Though compoſed of ſuch diſcordant
members, the whole party played in uniſon;
and every key, that was touched below, was
faithfully anſwered by a ſimilar note from above.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh buſineſs ſeemed to promiſe ſuch
a plentiful harveſt of confuſion, that the whole
party employed their joint labour, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the ſoil and ſowing the feed. Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
were not, in the mean time, idle, in
their ſeparate efforts, for the benefit of the

of Greenwich Hoſpital. The nature and fate of
this Inquiry, are ſo recent in the memory of the
Public, that a particular detail is as unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in itſelf, as it would be here out of place.</p>
            <p>It may be ſufficient to obſerve, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the enquiry was to criminate the firſt
Lord of the Admiralty. That after a moſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
examination, which laſted near three
months, not one of the charges was proved.
That the E. of S<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

cenſure, deſerved the higheſt praiſe. That he
had paid peculiar and uncommon attention to
the hoſpital. That he had improved its reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
increaſed the number of the penſioners,
prevented the admiſſion of improper objects,
made new regulations, for the more ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the ſick, and the better accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe in health. That inſtead of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſuperintendency of the charity to any
advantage, he had aboliſhed all ſinecures of
inferior offices, which had formerly been in
the diſpoſal of the firſt Lord. That, in direct
oppoſition to what had been alledged, there
is not one, out of 2169 penſioners at preſent in

himſelf, that he ſhould be able to lay the

of the miniſter for the American de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.
The nation found itſelf diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
but till matters were examined, it
was not known decidedly where cenſure ought
to fall. An unwillingneſs in Government, to
admit of a Parliamentary Inquiry, on a military
ſubject, furniſhed their enemies with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of drawing concluſions, unfavourable
to Miniſtry. Theſe concluſions, in the uſual
manner, became topics of patriotic invective
and declamation; which, in a manner, extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an inquiry, that had been once refuſed, by
a vote.</p>
            <p>But the reſult of the Inquiry, was very different
from what Oppoſition hoped. It appeared, that

were victorious, in every aſſault, attack, and

That the evacuation of Boſton had been too

            <p>With regard to the ſtrength of the country,
it appeared, that it preſented no advantages to
the natives, which it did not hold forth to the
invaders. That, on the contrary, it was rather
more favourable to the latter, than to the
former. That its great rivers, inſtead of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the retreat of the rebels, by being navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable,
laid them open to freſh misfortunes,
from an enemy, poſſeſſing the command of
the ſea. That Hudſon's River, in particular, by
dividing the whole continent from North to

between the revolted provinces. That the
ſeizing this barrier was an object of the firſt

this great advantage rendered the co-operation

            <p>In the courſe of the Evidence taken at home,
and more eſpecially by the moſt authentic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from abroad, it has appeared, that the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0176902600:40"/>
injudicious and inactive management of the
war has been the ſole obſtacle, to the reſtoration
of peace. That a very great majority of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of America are and have been, averſe to the
meaſures, and diſguſted at the tyranny of the
Congreſs<note n="n" place="bottom">Evidence, June 9. p. 12. June 16, <hi>paſſim.</hi>
               </note>. That they were prevented, from
exhibiting their loyalty to their Sovereign and
their averſion to uſurpation, by the deſultory
manner, in which the war was conducted, on
our part; as it deprived them of permanent
protection, and left them expoſed to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
cruelty, and revenge of their enemies.</p>
            <p>That the quitting of the Jerſeys, and the <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſea,</hi> with the whole army in July 1777,
terrified other provinces from ſubmitting, for
fear of being deſerred. That the three Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
Counties had offered their ſubmiſſion to
Government, on condition of their being <hi>only
aſſiſted,</hi> in protecting themſelves, againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels<note n="o" place="bottom">Evidence, June 16, p. 59.</note>.
That their application having either
been diſregarded or neglected, they adhered
to the uſurped government. That, as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
idea had gone abroad, that protection was
uncertain, or rather that deſertion was certain<note n="p" place="bottom">"We ſoon left the country. The rebels took up

the victory at the Brandywine, the taking of
Philadelphia, the deſtruction of the rebel ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
the reduction of Mud-Iſland and Red-Bank,
were attended with none of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which accompany ſucceſſes in war.
That no perſon of great conſequence, and few
of any conſequence at all, ſubmitted after
thoſe events. That, when a reſolution was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to evacuate Philadelphia, ſuch as had
ſubmitted were <hi>adviſed</hi> to make their peace
<note n="q" place="bottom">"Mr. Schumacker mentioned to me what he had

p. 74.</note>, with the congreſs. That ſome unfortunate
perſons, who followed that advice, fell a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to the relentleſs violence and unforgiving
tyranny of the rebels. That, in ſhort, the want
of protection on the one ſide, and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of puniſhment for defection, on the other,
eradicated every hope from the minds of the
loyal, and forced them to ſwear allegiance to
an uſurpation, which they deſpiſed and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0176902600:42"/>
Though theſe facts came forward with a
force, which commanded conviction, the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
adhered, with invincible obſtinacy, to the
line of their former conduct. With their uſual
inſult, upon the common feelings and common
ſenſe of mankind, they eſtabliſhed falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and deduced, from thoſe premiſes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for the total dereliction, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
for the dependance of America.
They affirmed, that rebellion can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed;
though the want of vigour, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
our ſucceſſes, has been the demonſtrable
cauſe of its continuing ſo long. They aſſerted,
that a general unanimity prevails againſt Great
Britain; though the adherence of the people
to the congreſs proceeded, from our not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
them a permanent protection, under
the ſhelter of our arms. They alleged, that the
courage of the rebels, and the natural ſtrength
of their country, are unſurmountable obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
though the firſt ſeldom appear in the
field, but to fly, and the latter opens every
where its boſom to invaſion, by the means of
extenſive arms of the ſea, and many great and
navigable rivers.</p>
            <p>When we deny other public virtues to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
we muſt allow, that they poſſeſs the
negative merit of conſiſtency in their political
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0176902600:43"/>
conduct. They ſtruck one key, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the American troubles, and they have
ever ſince continued the ſame note, or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon it, as events aroſe. When the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
began at Boſton, when licentiouſneſs and
riot exhibited their firſt wild ſcenes, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuil-Hall,
they encouraged the piece, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
the actors. The prints of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſteps of Freedom, like thoſe of Aſtraea,
were only to be found, they affirmed, round
the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> on Boſton Common. A
gloomy deſpotiſm had ſeized Great Britain at
home, and it became neceſſary, that her hands
ſhould be ſettered, to prevent the recovery of
her authority abroad. Every effort on the part
of the Mother-country was an exertion of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
every reſiſtance, in the colonies, was
an inſtance of public virtue. The grim tyrant,
Arbitrary Power, had taken up arms againſt
that <hi>innocent</hi> little child, American Liberty;
and to defend the weak againſt the ſtrong was
a ſervice of much reputation and little danger.</p>
            <p>Obvious as the deceptions, held forth by the
party, <hi>ought</hi> to have been, they were attended
with ſucceſs, both <hi>without</hi> and <hi>within</hi> doors.
The people thought, that aſſertions, ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and ſo often repeated, had ſome found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in truth; and, though Government knew
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0176902600:44"/>
the contrary, they acted, as if they gave them
credit. The conſequence was, that languid
meaſures were adopted, when vigour and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were neceſſary; and, thus, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of Adminiſtration, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Oppoſition, the inactivity or inability
of commanders, that monſter, REBELLION,
which ſhould have been ſtifled as ſoon as born,
was foſtered and reared to maturity.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for this country, Oppoſition
were permitted, in a manner, to take the lead
in American meaſures. War, and eſpecially
rebellion, being one of the greateſt evils, that
can afflict a ſtate, the moſt ſpeedy and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
remedies muſt be applied, to remove the
diſeaſe. The only certain road to peace lies
through exertion and victory. An anxiety for
negociation, being generally a mark of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
too often encourages an enemy to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of reſiſtance. It has alſo a moſt unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
effect on the ſpirit of the people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whoſe leaders ſuch anxiety appears. This
double conſideration had rendered the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
terms a favourite topic of patriotic elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
To depreſs the minds of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
to elevate thoſe of the rebels; to make
the firſt to doubt, the ſecond to become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of ſucceſs; to keep up, if the expreſſion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0176902600:45"/>
may be uſed, the ball of contention between
the parties, were circumſtances that probably
might lengthen the diſpute to the verge
of ſome public misfortune; that misfortune,
if it favoured not the views of ambition,
might, at leaſt, be turned to the purpoſes of
revenge.</p>
            <p>The calamity expected, with ſo much anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
by Oppoſition, at length arrived. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was loſt in America. A rebellion, which
ſeemed to ſtagger under partial and ill-purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
defeats, became firmly eſtabliſhed by vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
The ſpirits of the country began to ſink;
and the Faction added to the general depreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by their unmanly oratory. Inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
thoſe vigorous exertions, which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as well as intereſt of the nation required,
they recommended a tame ſubmiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
an acknowledgment of former errors,
and aſſurances of future amendment. The
world, in general, aſcribed to artifice a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
which could not be reconciled to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of common ſenſe. Was it probable that
inſurgents, who had offered no terms during
their misfortunes, would receive any in the
moment of victory? Or could it be expected,
that a Congreſs, who had declared for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
when thirty thouſand diſciplined
ſoldiers were ready to land on the coaſt, would
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0176902600:46"/>
relinquiſh that independence, after they had
made a whole army priſoners of war?</p>
            <p>The moſt ſanguine lovers of tranquility
could ſcarcely derive any hopes from this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
ſyſtem; but it was adopted. The Faction
thus obtained that degradation of their own
country, which ſeems to have been uniformly
a part of their plan. But as it had been juſtly
apprehended, that American reſiſtance might,
at laſt, ceaſe, through the failure of American
reſources, it had become neceſſary to procure
powerful allies, for the ſupport of the cauſe.
The defeat and capture of the army, under
G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l B<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ne, had certainly its weight in
the French cabinet. But the deplorable pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
given, in both Houſes, of the ſtate of this
kingdom, could only induce France to throw
her weight into the ſcale of America.</p>
            <p>The weight of France having been found
inſufficient in the operations of the laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the neceſſity of obtaining <hi>another</hi> ally, to
the <hi>cauſe of Liberty,</hi> became apparent during
the winter. Every encouragement and every
lure were held out to Spain. Under a pretence
of bewailing their unfortunate country, Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
expoſed her weakneſs. Their own decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
ſhewed that her councils were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by faction; and their aſſertions, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0176902600:47"/>
to the ſtate of her navy and army, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her to foreigners as an eaſy prey. To
bring the certainty of her approaching ruin to
a point of demonſtration, ſome theoriſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with figures, were employed to make
fictitious ſtates of her finances. Even ſome of
the party had the folly, or rather preſumption,
to aſſert, in public, that the very indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Great Britain was in the power of
the houſe of Bourbon<note n="r" place="bottom">Contemptible as ſuch aſſertions may ſeem, at home,
they make an impreſſion abroad; as appears, from the
<hi>Gazette de France du Vendredi</hi> 18 <hi>Juin</hi> 1779: "Il ſoutint
que les forces de la France étoient preſque egales a celle
de la Grand-Bretagne en Europe et en Amerique; que

            <p>The phlegmatic councils of Spain were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
too ſlow for the fire and vehemence of
her Britiſh friends. Though their eloquence
had its proper influence at Madrid, that <hi>deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
circumſtance had been concealed in "Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian
taciturnity." Deprived almoſt of every
hope, from the other ſide of the Bay of Biſcay,
the eyes of our Patriots were again turned to
the regions beyond the Atlantic. As the treaty
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0176902600:48"/>
attempted laſt ſummer had ſtopt the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of war, it was expedient to throw negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in the way of hoſtility in the preſent year.
Though the party had reprobated their <hi>own</hi>
meaſure, the conciliatory bills, as degrading
and diſgraceful, they propoſed the renewal of
the commiſſion, which thoſe bills authorized.
This mode of relief, or rather reſpite, to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
having been refuſed, the old propoſal, of
withdrawing the troops from America, was
renewed. This laſt effort was alſo unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and that melancholy gloom, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
covers the rear of unſucceſsful, political
campaigns, began to fall on the party.</p>
            <p>A ſudden, though not unexpected light,
broke through this gloom, and revived their

            <p>The uniform conduct of Oppoſition ſeemed
calculated, if not intended, to arm Spain in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of France and America; yet they affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a degree of melancholy when that event was
announced. With a pernicious conſiſtency,
they dwelt on the weakneſs of Great Britain,
and on the force of her enemies. Inſtead of
ſtanding forth with that manly boldneſs, which
other patriots have either felt or feigned, in
times of peril, they unbraced the nerves of their
country with womaniſh lamentations. To
magnify the danger, they pretended to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
unanimity; and to promife ſupport to

ſorrow were ſoon changed for the voice
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0176902600:50"/>
of diſcord; and it became apparent, that the
party lamented their own condition more than
the ſtate of their country.</p>
            <p>In the preceding detail, many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are omitted, equally deſcriptive of the
conduct, and expreſſive of the deſigns of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
with thoſe that have been related.
But, as the intention of this Eſſay is only
to give a general idea of the ſubject, it was
thought unneceſſary to deſcend to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
One obvious obſervation will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuggeſt itſelf to the mind of the Reader:
That an Oppoſition begun in ambition, has
degenerated, through diſappointment, into a
ſpecies of infinity; and that, in attempting
to ruin the Miniſtry, the party have given a
fatal ſtab to the honour and intereſts of their
country.</p>
            <p>In every popular government, oppoſition is
not only natural, but, when conducted on libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
principles, uſeful, and even neceſſary.
There is a kind of charm in authority, which
may induce the moſt virtuous magiſtrates to
extend it too far, if ſubject to no controul.
The original object of a national repreſentative,
was to watch over the political rights of the
executive power. The truſt is great; and,
ſtrictly ſpeaking, ought to be ſolely appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0176902600:51"/>
to the public good. Thoſe who uſe it
as an engine of private ambition and perſonal
inrereſt, meet with forgiveneſs, on account of
the frequency of the practice. But the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a weapon, given for the defence of our
country, againſt its exiſtence, is a ſpecies of
political aſſaſſination which no example can
juſtify, no ſtate ought to paſs without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If the great lines of the conduct of Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
during the laſt ſeſſion of parliament, have
been fairly traced, in the preceding diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no terms can be too ſevere, no indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too violent, in expoſing the principles and
plans of the party. If the account, which has
been given of their aſſertions and actions, has
been exaggerated, the Public will judge of
both with more candour. But, unfortunately
for Great Britain, the ſtamp of truth has been
affixed to the repreſentation, contained in this
Eſſay, by the moſt uncontrovertible of all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the events of the times: events unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled
in the hiſtory of any other age or country.</p>
            <p>Let the conſequences of an oppoſite conduct,
in the party, be conſidered, for a moment.
Let it be ſuppoſed, that, inſtead of abetting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and encouraging foreign war, they had
declared that, when the American Congreſs
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0176902600:52"/>
avowed Independence, and eſpecially when they
leagued with France, the grounds of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
queſtion were entirely changed. That, as
friends of their country, they had reſolved to
ſtrengthen her hands, to reſtore her authority,
to protect her intereſts, and to recover her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
That the object of their purſuit had been
to render Miniſters reſponſible for remiſſneſs in
carrying on the war; or for obſtinacy in refuſing
adequate and honourable conditions of peace.
That they had been the firſt to inquire into the
failure of meaſures in the execution; not to
aſſert without examination, that the error lay
in the cabinet and not in the field. That they
had taken meaſures to aſcertain, by what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management
or miſconduct, in commanders, an
army had been loſt, to a contemptible enemy,
and a ſuperior fleet had returned from action,
without a victory? That, inſtead of receiving
into the boſom of their party, a general, who
had quitted his command in the midſt of war,
they had inquired, why the advantages, he
either poſſeſſed or obtained, had not been more
deciſively improved?</p>
            <p>To render ſtill more finiſhed the picture of
the reverſe of their actual proceedings, let it be
ſuppoſed, that inſtead of announcing, to all
Europe, the weakneſs of Great Britain, they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0176902600:53"/>
had, in their ſpeeches and their actions, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
a ſpirited and diſintereſted love for their
country, an unanimity to arm her exertions,
not to clog her meaſures, a manly boldneſs to
meet, to break, to diſconcert the combinations
of her domeſtic and foreign enemies. What
would have been, in ſuch a caſe, the preſent
ſituation of public affairs? What the ſtate of
public opinion, relative to themſelves? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of America muſt have ceaſed. France
might have given up the conteſt; and the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spain would have been prevented.</p>
            <p>One ſhould ſuppoſe it hardly poſſible, that an
Oppoſition, conſiſting of ſeveral men, whoſe rank
and fortune connect their private intereſt with
that of the public, ſhould follow a line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
that leads to the deſtruction of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and, conſequently, to their own ruin. This
is an argument which they themſelves repeat, and
think unanſwerable. The truth is, that every
faction may avail itſelf of the ſame argument;
but general reaſoning muſt fall to the ground,
when contradicted by facts. There is a pride
and obſtinacy in party, which diſdain to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
error; and, therefore, though Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
may, nay muſt, perceive the pernicious
tendency of their conduct, they chooſe to perſiſt,
rather than own a fault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0176902600:54"/>
An opportunity offered itſelf lately, which
might have reflected credit on Oppoſition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſuppoſed diſgrace of changing their
former opinions. The Spaniſh <hi>Reſcript</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
this opportunity; yet the nation cannot
ſee, without indignation and aſtoniſhment, that
ACTS indiſpenſably neceſſary for the ſafety of
the State have been combated, with all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulence
and obſtinacy of oratory, in every ſtage
of their progreſs. That the party clogged every
meaſure for arming the kingdom, by ſea and
land, while they aſſerted, that the enemy were
ready to invade our coaſt, and that a few days
might bring the report of their guns to the ears
of both houſes of parliament. That, when a
ſpirit of unanimity and exertion became the duty
of all lovers of their country, the faction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
with a ſpecies of ſavage triumph, that
the City of London would not vote a man
or a ſhilling, for the national defence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
emergency. That, in ſhort, they preſumed to
aſſert in public, that the tyranny of France and
Spain would be more welcome to them, than
the continuance of their rivals in power.</p>
            <p>After ſuch proofs of averſion to the public
good, it will be in vain to hope for any reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in Oppoſition. The diſtreſs in which they
have involved their country, can advance but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0176902600:55"/>
one ſtep farther, to furniſh them with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of retreating from the line of their miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
That ſtep is an invaſion of this Iſland,
the laſt effort of the conſpiracy of our foreign
enemies. In that critical moment, a moment
which every good ſubject would meet with ſpirit
and confidence in his cauſe, there is every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to fear, that Oppoſition would be ſtill an
Oppoſition. Such has been the inveteracy which
a conſciouſneſs of criminality, a jealouſy of rivals,
a habit of oppoſing the intereſts and degrading
the dignity of their country; and a deſpair em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered
by an unpopular and fruitleſs conteſt of
many years, have mixed with every ſpring of
their actions, every power of their minds.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, we may fairly affirm,
that neither the talents they poſſeſs, nor the
conduct they have purſued, are likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
Oppoſition as proper perſons for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
public affairs at the preſent criſis. If
our ſituation is alarming, we muſt look for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to the reſources of the kingdom, and the
ſpirit of our countrymen, and not to thoſe, who
have uniformly endeavoured to depreciate the
firſt, and to damp the ſecond. The truth is,
that, very fortunately for this country, this
deſponding party have hitherto failed in their
views of convincing us that our ruin is inevitable.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0176902600:56"/>
We feel the contrary, in the internal vigour of
the ſtate, and in that unanimity of ſentiment
among the people, which forbids us to connect
danger with deſpair.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould either be mentioned, upon
the preſent occaſion? This country, with much
ſmaller reſources, and much leſs unanimity, has
repeatedly weathered more dreadful ſtorms than
thoſe which only <hi>ſeem</hi> to threaten it at preſent.
In the firſt Dutch war, France and Denmark
joined the enemy againſt England<note n="b" place="bottom">In 1665, 1666, &amp;c. <hi>Vide</hi> Life of Clarendon,
Burnet, Rapin, Ralph, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>. She had
no friendly port on the continent, from the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees
to the pole; no ally but the Biſhop of
Munſter. The Dutch came out, to a deciſive
battle, with one hundred and thirteen ſhips of
war, eleven fire-ſhips, and ſeven yatchts; led by
able, experienced, and brave commanders.
France, co-operating with her allies, entered
the Channel with forty ſhips of the line. The
uſual revenue of England amounted only to the
annual ſum of one million two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds; and the ſupplies granted, for the
year, exceeded not double that ſum. Our
ſtanding army ſcarcely conſiſted of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men; and there was no militia in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0176902600:57"/>
The nation was, in the mean time, viſited
with two of the moſt dreadful calamities that
can afflict a people, peſtilence and fire. Near
eighty thouſand perſons had been carried off by
the firſt, in London alone. The city had become
a kind of deſert; and graſs was obſerved to
grow in the middle of Cheapſide<note n="c" place="bottom">Baker, p. 637.</note>. The
plague followed thoſe who fled to the country;
and terror and death filled every corner of the
kingdom. This ſcourge was followed by a
fire, which conſumed fifteen out of the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſix
wards of the city, conſiſting of four hundred
ſtreets and lanes, thirteen thouſand houſes, and
eighty-nine pariſh-churches<note n="d" place="bottom">Vide Clarendon, Heath, Burnet.</note>. But theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
neither damped the ſpirits of the
people, nor obſtructed the meaſures of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Our fleets, though much inferior, fought,
and vanquiſhed the enemy. The alliance againſt
us was broken, and an honourable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
peace was obtained.</p>
            <p>In the year 1690, the French fleet entered
the Engliſh channel, appeared before Plymouth,
on the 20th of June, drove the combined fleets
of England and Holland, from the back, of the
iſle of Wight, engaged and totally defeated
them, in a general battle, near Beachy-head.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0176902600:58"/>
In this unfortunate action we loſt eight ſhips of
the line, beſides many more, that were rendered
unfit for ſervice; and the ſhattered remains of
the fleet were forced to ſhelter themſelves in the
Thames<note n="e" place="bottom">Lord Torrington's Letter, July 1, 1690.</note>. The French rode triumphant,
for ſome months, in the Channel. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
our ſea-ports; and threatened our coaſts
with invaſion. There were, at the time, no
more than <hi>five thouſand</hi> regular troops in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
the militia were not arrayed; King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
was, in a manner, confined to Ireland, by
the ſuperiority of the enemy at ſea.</p>
            <p>The nation was, at the ſame time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
and divided in opinion, on account
of a diſputed ſucceſſion. Public credit, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole war, was ſo low, that ſoon
after this period, Exchequer and Navy Bills
became almoſt of as little value, as the paſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
dollars of the American Congreſs; and
even the notes of the Bank of England were
at <hi>forty per cent.</hi> diſcount<note n="f" place="bottom">Kennet, Ralph, Burnet, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>. Near <hi>ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
trading veſſels were taken by the French in
the courſe of the war<note n="g" place="bottom">Vide Journals of the Commons, 169<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. Notwithſtanding
theſe misfortunes, the vigour of Government
and ſpirit of the people ſurmounted all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0176902600:59"/>
The enemy was diſappointed, in all his
ambitious views, an honourable peace was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the revolution confirmed, the proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
ſucceſſion ſecured, and public credit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
            <p>In the preſent times, our reſources are much
greater, our ſpirit equal, and our danger leſs,
than at either of thoſe periods. We have an
ample revenue, an untainted credit, a great and
a growing navy. Inſtead of <hi>five thouſand</hi> men,
we have above <hi>ſixty thouſand</hi> diſciplined troops,
for our internal defence; and we have a certain
proſpect of half as many more, in the ſpace of
a few months. A ſpirit of unanimity, vigour,
and exertion, begins to pervade the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Our nobility and gentry, with a ſpirit
becoming Britons, either ſerve in our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
defence, the militia, or with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and purſes exert themſelves, in raiſing
new corps. The greateſt commercial ſociety,
in the kingdom, has ſet a noble example to
their fellow-ſubjects, by an unanimous and
powerful aid to the ſtate, in the preſent emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.
Voluntary ſubſcriptions, for raiſing ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and for giving a bounty to ſailors, have
been opened, in ſeveral places; and the ſame
ſpirit will diffuſe itſelf through both the Britiſh
iſles. Such as are debarred, by infirmities and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0176902600:60"/>
years, from perſonal ſervice, will undoubtedly
exhibit, on the preſent occaſion, their love for
their country, and their zeal for its ſafety.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of being depreſſed, with a ſenſe of
danger, all ranks and degrees of men feel that
elevation, which threatened perils excite, in
generous minds. Inſtead of looking forward to
future diſgraces or diſaſters, they reflect on the
glory of former times. The poſterity of thoſe,
who conquered at Poictiers, Creſſy, and Agin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
and annexed France itſelf to the Engliſh
crown, cannot form to themſelves any fears from
a French invaſion. On the contrary, when they
have ſufficiently prepared for ſecurity at home,
they will act offenſively abroad; and carry back
to the boſom of the enemy that terror, which
he vainly hopes to create.</p>
            <p>If we are at war in America, we have
not the burden of a continental war; that
ſink, in which our treaſure has always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared,
without any hope of return. The
money laid out on our navy, or expended in
our Colonies, will return to the center of the
kingdom, through all the veins of commerce.
Our trade has been protected, againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to a degree unknown in any former war.
We have loſt, in no quarter of the world, any
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0176902600:61"/>
territory without an equivalent; in ſome we
have gained. In the Weſt Indies, we are ſtill
ſuperior to our Enemies. We have eradicated
them entirely from the Eaſt Indies, and we
have a flattering proſpect of a ſpeedy termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reſiſtance, in North America.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſtage of a war, the advantage of
attack is poſſeſſed, by that nation, who firſt
breaks the peace. The diſadvantages of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
muſt, for ſome time, remain with its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent.
A ſtate poſſeſſing ſuch extenſive do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
as Great Britain, cannot be ſuppoſed,
to be invulnerable, on every ſide. We may
ſuffer ſome loſſes, at the beginning; for what
people was ever uniformly ſucceſsful in war?
The Romans themſelves were not always invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
They frequently loſt provinces and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
yet they roſe ſuperior to all nations. The
profits and loſſes of war can only be eſtimated,
on the day, which concludes a peace. Let us
be unanimous among ourſelves, and that day
cannot be diſtant, diſadvantageous, or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;
on the contrary, it will be attended
with that glory, which the ſpirit and exertion of
a great ſtate cannot fail to acquire.</p>
