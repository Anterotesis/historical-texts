            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN a country, where addreſſes of this nature have generally waited upon the Great, upon a Wealthy Merchant, a Rich Commiſſary, or ſome New Man from the Sugar-iſlands, it will appear as ſurprizing, to many, as, no doubt, it will to yourſelf, that a New Form of Dedication ſhould now be introduced. For the trouble I am giving you it will, however, be unneceſſary to make any further apology, when I obſerve that in France, where talents are honoured, it has been frequently the practice of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated wits to do juſtice to thoſe, who, by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, are the very Organ of the Muſes. A VOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIRE and a MARMONTEL have paid their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a CLAIRON: and why may not an Engliſh Author, inferior as he is, and ever muſt be, to writers of that claſs, rival at leaſt their politeneſs, by addreſſing himſelf to Mrs. DANCER, one of the firſt Ornaments of the Britiſh Theatre?</p>
            <p>There are, indeed, I muſt confeſs it, ſome demands upon my gratitude on this occaſion, which even now are ſtruggling to call my attention another way. Mr. GARRICK, Madam, has a claim to all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome things that can be ſaid of him. His politeneſs from the moment he ſaw the play, his aſſiduity in preparing it for repreſentation, the taſte with which he has decorated it, and the warmth of his zeal for the honour of the piece, are circumſtances that call upon me for the ſtrongeſt acknowledgements. I
<pb facs="tcp:0642101100:4"/>
could employ my pen with pleaſure in thanking Mr. BARRY for the very fine exertion of his powers, wherever the Poet gave the ſmalleſt opportunity. Mr. HOLLAND, who had before now given ſpirit to ſuch ſcenes as mine, has renewed the obligation. I could add others to the liſt, but they, and even Mr. GARRICK at their head, muſt excuſe me, if I turn to Mrs. DANCER, and ſay with <hi>Hamlet,</hi> "Here's mettle more attractive."</p>
            <p>ZENOBIA, Madam, is your own entirely. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my inaccuracy has left imperfections, they are ſo happily varniſhed over by your ſkill, that either they are not ſeen, or you extort forgiveneſs for them: and if the Author is any where happy enough to <hi>ſnatch a grace</hi> beyond his uſual reach, it is multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by your addreſs into a number of beauties, like the SWORD in <hi>Taſſo'</hi>s <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which, when bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhed by the hand of <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> appears to the whole army to be THREE SWORDS.</p>
            <p>The fate of ZENOBIA has been very extraordinary. She was ſaved in her life-time from the waters of the <hi>Araxes</hi> by the hand of a ſhepherd, and now ſhe is ſaved from the critics by Mrs. DANCER.</p>
            <p>In teſtimony of the fact, the play, Madam, is now inſcribed to you by him, who admires your talents, and remains</p>

                  <l>Join'd with a certain IRISHMAN—O fye!</l>
                  <l>She made you, when you ought to laugh, to cry.—</l>
                  <l>Her ſiſter's ſmiles with tears ſhe try'd to ſmother,</l>
                  <l>Rais'd ſuch a tragi-comic kind of pother,</l>
                  <l>You laugh'd with one eye, while you cry'd with t'other.</l>
                  <l>What can be done?—ſad work behind the ſcenes!</l>
                  <l>There comic females ſcold with tragic queens.</l>
                  <l>Each party different ways the foe aſſails,</l>
                  <l>Theſe ſhake their daggers, thoſe prepare their nails.</l>
                  <l>'Tis You alone muſt calm theſe dire miſhaps,</l>
                  <l>Or we ſhall ſtill continue pulling caps.</l>
                  <l>What is your will?—I read it in your faces;</l>
                  <l>That all hereafter take their proper places,</l>
                  <l>Shake hands, and kiſs and friends, and—BURN THEIR CASES.</l>
