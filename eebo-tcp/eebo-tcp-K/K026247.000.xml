            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A
CONVERSATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN February, 1767, there happened one of the moſt remarkable incidents
of Johnſon's life, which gratified his monarchical enthuſiaſm, and which he
loved to relate with all its circumſtances, when requeſted by his friends. This
was his being honoured by a private converſation with his Majeſty, in the
library at the Queen's houſe. He had frequently viſited thoſe ſplendid rooms
and noble collection of books<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Johnſon had the honour of contributing his aſſiſtance towards the formation of this library; for I have read a long letter from him to Mr. Barnard, giving the moſt maſterly inſtructions on the ſubject. I wiſhed much to have gratified my readers with the peruſal of this letter, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that his Majeſty would have been graciouſly pleaſed to permit its publication; but Mr. Barnard, to whom I applied, declined it "on his own account."</note>, which he uſed to ſay was more numerous and
curious than he ſuppoſed any perſon could have made in the time which the
King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he ſhould
have every accommodation that could contribute to his eaſe and convenience,
while indulging his literary taſte in that place; ſo that he had here a very
agreeable reſource at leiſure hours.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty having been informed of his occaſional viſits, was pleaſed to
ſignify a deſire that he ſhould be told when Dr. Johnſon came next to the
library. Accordingly, the next time that Johnſon did come, as ſoon as he
was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he ſat by the fire, he ſeemed
quite intent, Mr. Barnard ſtole round to the apartment where the King was,
and, in obedience to his Majeſty's commands, mentioned that Dr. Johnſon was
then in the library. His Majeſty ſaid he was at leiſure, and would go to him;
upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that ſtood on the King's table,
and lighted his Majeſty through a ſuite of rooms, till they came to a private
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0523300700:4"/>
door into the library, of which his Majeſty had the key. Being entered, Mr.
Barnard ſtepped forward haſtily to Dr. Johnſon, who was ſtill in a profound
ſtudy, and whiſpered him, "Sir, here is the King." Johnſon ſtarted up, and ſtood
ſtill. His Majeſty approached him, and at once was courteouſly eaſy<note n="*" place="bottom">The particulars of this converſation I have been at great pains to collect with the utmoſt authenticity, from Dr. Johnſon's own detail to myſelf; from Mr. Langton, who was preſent when he gave an account of it to Dr. Joſeph Warton, and ſeveral other friends, at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's; from Mr. Barnard; from the copy of a letter written by the late Mr. Strahan the printer, to Biſhop Warburton; and from a minute, the original of which is among the papers of the late Sir James Caldwell, and a copy of which was moſt obligingly obtained for me from his ſon Sir John Caldwell, by Sir Francis Lumm. To all theſe gentlemen I beg leave to make my grateful acknowledgements, and particularly to Sir Francis Lumm, who was pleaſed to take a great deal of trouble, and even had the minute laid before the King by Lord Caermarthen, now Duke of Leeds, one of his Majeſty's Principal Secretaries of State, who announced to Sir Francis the Royal pleaſure concerning it by a letter, in theſe words: "I have the King's commands to aſſure you, Sir, how ſenſible his Majeſty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the converſation previous to its publication. As there appears no objection to your complying with Mr. Boſwell's wiſhes on the ſubject, you are at full liberty to deliver it to that gentleman, to make ſuch uſe of in his Life of Dr. Johnſon, as he may think proper."</note>.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty began by obſerving, that he underſtood he came ſometimes to
the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been
lately at Oxford, aſked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which
Johnſon anſwered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford ſometimes,
but was likewiſe glad to come back again. The King then aſked him what
they were doing at Oxford. Johnſon anſwered, he could not much commend
their diligence, but that in ſome reſpects they were mended, for they had put
their preſs under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius.
He was then aſked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge.
He anſwered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;
at the ſame time adding, "I hope, whether we have more books or
not than they have at Cambridge, we ſhall make as good uſe of them as they
do." Being aſked whether All-Souls or Chriſt-Church library was the largeſt,
he anſwered, "All-Souls library is the largeſt we have, except the Bodleian."
"Aye, (ſaid the King,) that is the publick library."</p>
            <p>His Majeſty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He anſwered,
he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and muſt
now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it ſhould ſeem with a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0523300700:5"/>
view to urge him to rely on his own ſtores as an original writer, and to continue
his labours, then ſaid, "I do not think you borrow much from any body."
Johnſon ſaid, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. "I ſhould
have thought ſo too, (ſaid the King,) if you had not written ſo well."—
Johnſon obſerved to me, upon this, that "No man could have paid a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer
compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was deciſive." When
aſked by another friend, at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, whether he made any reply
to this high compliment, he anſwered, "No, Sir. When the King had ſaid
it, it was to be ſo. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my ſovereign."
Perhaps no man who had ſpent his whole life in courts could have ſhewn a
more nice and dignified ſenſe of true politeneſs, than Johnſon did in this inſtance.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty having obſerved to him that he ſuppoſed he muſt have read a
great deal; Johnſon anſwered, that he thought more than he read; that he
had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill
health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for
inſtance, he ſaid he had not read much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon
which the King ſaid, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of ſuch general
knowledge, that you could ſcarce talk with him on any ſubject on which he
was not qualified to ſpeak; and that his learning reſembled Garrick's acting,
in its univerſality. His Majeſty then talked of the controverſy between
Warburton and Lowth, which he ſeemed to have read, and aſked Johnſon
what he thought of it. Johnſon anſwered, "Warburton has moſt general,
moſt ſcholaſtick learning; Lowth is the more correct ſcholar. I do not know
which of them calls names beſt." The King was pleaſed to ſay he was of
the ſame opinion; adding, "You do not think then, Dr. Johnſon, that there
was much argument in the caſe." Johnſon ſaid, he did not think there was.
"Why truly, (ſaid the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is pretty well at an end."</p>
            <p>His Majeſty then aſked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton's hiſtory,
which was then juſt publiſhed. Johnſon ſaid, he thought his ſtyle pretty good,
but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. "Why, (ſaid
the King,) they ſeldom do theſe things by halves." "No, Sir, (anſwered
Johnſon,) not to Kings." But fearing to be miſunderſtood, he proceeded to
explain himſelf; and immediately ſubjoined, "That for thoſe who ſpoke
worſe of Kings than they deſerved, he could find no excuſe, but that he could
more eaſily conceive how ſome might ſpeak better of them than they deſerved,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0523300700:6"/>
without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give,
thoſe who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
their praiſes; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly
excuſeable, as far as errour could be excuſeable."</p>
            <p>The King then aſked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. Johnſon anſwered,
that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately
mentioned, as an inſtance of it, an aſſertion of that writer, that he had
ſeen objects magnified to a much greater degree by uſing three or four micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes
at a time, than by uſing one. "Now, (added Johnſon,) every one
acquainted with microſcopes knows, that the more of them he looks through,
the leſs the object will appear." "Why, (replied the King,) this is not only
telling an untruth, but telling it clumſily; for, if that be the caſe, every one
who can look through a microſcope will be able to detect him."</p>
            <p>"I now, (ſaid Johnſon to his friends, when relating what had paſſed,)
began to conſider that I was depreciating this man in the eſtimation of his
ſovereign, and thought it was time for me to ſay ſomething that might be
more favourable." He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwithſtanding,
a very curious obſerver; and if he would have been contented to tell the
world no more than he knew, he might have been a very conſiderable man,
and needed not to have recourſe to ſuch mean expedients to raiſe his
reputation.</p>
            <p>The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the
<hi>Journal des Savans,</hi> and aſked Johnſon if it was well done. Johnſon ſaid,
it was formerly very well done, and gave ſome account of the perſons who
began it, and carried it on for ſome years; enlarging at the ſame time, on the
nature and uſe of ſuch works. The King aſked him if it was well done now.
Johnſon anſwered, he had no reaſon to think that it was. The King then
aſked him if there were any other literary journals publiſhed in this kingdom,
except the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and on being anſwered there were
no other, his Majeſty aſked which of them was the beſt: Johnſon anſwered,
that the Monthly Review was done with moſt care, the Critical upon the beſt
principles; adding, that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies
to the Church. This the King ſaid he was ſorry to hear.</p>
            <p>The converſation next turned on the Philoſophical Tranſactions, when
Johnſon obſerved, that they had now a better method of arranging their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0523300700:7"/>
materials than formerly. "Aye, (ſaid the King,) they are obliged to Dr.
Johnſon for that;" for his Majeſty had heard and remembered the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which Johnſon himſelf had forgot.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty expreſſed a deſire to have the literary biography of this country
ably executed, and propoſed to Dr. Johnſon to undertake it. Johnſon ſignified
his readineſs to comply with his Majeſty's wiſhes.</p>
            <p>During the whole of this interview, Johnſon talked to his Majeſty with
profound reſpect, but ſtill in his firm manly manner, with a ſonorous voice,
and never in that ſubdued tone which is commonly uſed at the levee and in
the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnſon ſhewed himſelf highly
pleaſed with his Majeſty's converſation and gracious behaviour. He ſaid to
Mr. Barnard, "Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the
fineſt gentleman I have ever ſeen." And he afterwards obſerved to Mr.
Langton, "Sir, his manners are thoſe of as fine a gentleman as we may
ſuppoſe Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second."</p>
            <p>At Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, where a circle of Johnſon's friends was collected
round him to hear his account of this memorable converſation, Dr. Joſeph
Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in preſſing him to
mention the particulars. "Come now, Sir, this is an intereſting matter; do
favour us with it." Johnſon, with great good humour, complied.</p>
            <p>He told them, "I found his Majeſty wiſhed I ſhould talk, and I made
it my buſineſs to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his
ſovereign. In the firſt place, a man cannot be in a paſſion—" Here ſome
queſtion interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would
have pointed out and illuſtrated many circumſtances of advantage, from being in
a ſituation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous
exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</p>
            <p>During all the time in which Dr. Johnſon was employed in relating to the
circle at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's the particulars of what paſſed between the
King and him, Dr. Goldſmith remained unmoved upon a ſopha at ſome
diſtance, affecting not to join in the leaſt in the eager curioſity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
He aſſigned as a reaſon for his gloom and ſeeming inattention, that he
apprehended Johnſon had relinquiſhed his purpoſe of furniſhing him with a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0523300700:8"/>
Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it
was ſtrongly ſuſpected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the
ſingular honour Dr. Johnſon had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankneſs
and ſimplicity of his natural character prevailed. He ſprung from the ſopha,
advanced to Johnſon, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining himſelf in the
ſituation which he had juſt been hearing deſcribed, exclaimed, "Well, you
acquitted yourſelf in this converſation better than I ſhould have done; for I
ſhould have bowed and ſtammered through the whole of it."</p>
