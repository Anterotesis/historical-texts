            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHAT various transformations we remark,</l>
               <l>From Eaſt Whitechapel to the Weſt Hyde-park!</l>
               <l>Men, women, children, houſes, ſigns, and faſhions,</l>
               <l>State, ſtage, trade, taſte, the humours and the paſſions;</l>
               <l>Th' Exchange, 'Change alley, whereſoe'er your ranging,</l>
               <l>Court, city, country, all are chang'd, or changing;</l>
               <l>The ſtreets ſometime ago, were pav'd with ſtones,</l>
               <l>Which, aided by a hackney coach, half broke your bones.</l>
               <l>The pureſt lovers then indulg'd no bliſs;</l>
               <l>They run great hazard if they ſtole a kiſs—</l>

                  <hi>One chaſte ſalute—the Damſel cry'd, O fye!</hi>

               <l>As they approach'd, ſlap went the coach awry,</l>
               <l>—Poor Sylvia got a bump, and Damon a black eye.</l>
               <l>But now weak nerves in hackney coaches roam,</l>

               <l>Conceal'd the ſhallow head from the beholders!</l>
               <l>But now the whole's revers'd—each fop appears,</l>
               <l>Cropp'd, and trimm'd up—expoſing head and ears;</l>
               <l>The buckle then it's modeſt limits knew—</l>
               <l>Now, like the ocean, dreadful to the view,</l>

                  <p>I own moſt of them are, indeed, but empty; yet there are delights, of which a private life is deſtitute, which may divert an honeſt man, and be a harmleſs entertainment to a virtuous woman: good muſick is one; and truly, (with ſome ſmall allowance) the plays, I think, may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another.</p>

                  <speaker>LD. FOPPINGTON.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſo much of your ladyſhip's mind, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that I have a private gallery in town, where I walk ſometimes, which is furniſhed with nothing but books and looking glaſſes.

                  <p>Nay, I love a neat library too, but 'tis, I think, the inſide of a book ſhould recommend it moſt to us.</p>

                  <p>That, I muſt confeſs, I am not altogether ſo fand of, far to my mind, the inſide of a book is to entertain one's ſelf with the forced product of another man's brain. Now I think a man of quality and breeding may be much more diverted with the natural ſprauts of his own; but to ſay the truth, Madam, let a

man love reading never ſo well, when once he comes to know the tawn, he finds ſo many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ways of paſſing away the four-and-twenty hours, that it were ten thouſand pities he ſhould conſume his time in that. Far example, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, now my life, my life, Madam, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtream of pleaſure, that glides through with ſuch a variety of entertainments, I believe the wiſeſt of our anceſtors never had the leaſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of 'em. I riſe, Madam, when in town, about twelve o'clock. I don't riſe ſooner, becauſe it is the worſt thing in the world for the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; nat that I pretend to be a beau, but a man muſt endeavour to look decent, leſt he makes ſo odious a figure in the ſide-bax, the ladies ſhould be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play; ſo, at twelve o'clock I ſay I riſe. Naw, if I find it a good day, I reſalve to take the exerciſe of riding, ſo drink my chocolate, and draw on my boots by two. On my return, I dreſs; and after dinner, lounge, perhaps to the Opera.</p>

                  <p>Like man and wife—aſunder—he lov'd the country—I the town.—He hawks and hounds—I coaches and equipage.—He eating and drinking—I carding and playing.—He the ſound of a horn—I the ſqueek of a fiddle.—We were dull company at table—worſe a-bed: whenever we met we gave one another the ſpleen, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agreed but once, which was about lying alone.</p>

                  <p>O yes.—I was forced to wear an odious Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows' band a twelve-month for't.</p>

                  <p>Women, I find, have different inclinations:—prithee, Berinthia, inſtruct me a little farther—for I'm ſo great a novice, I'm almoſt aſham'd on't.—Not Heav'n knows that what you call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues have any charms for me—the practical part of all unlawful love is—</p>

                  <p>O no, Amanda—there are a ſort of men make dreadful work amongſt 'em—men that may be called the Beaus Antipathy—for they agree in nothing but walking upon two legs. Theſe have brains—the beau has none.—Theſe are in love with their miſtreſs—the beau with himſelf.—They take care of their reputation—he's induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to deſtroy it—They are decent—he's a fop.

                  <p>Why then, my caſe in a word is this.—The neceſſary expences of my travels have ſo much exceeded the wretched income of my annuity, that I have been forced to mortgage it for five hundred pounds, which is ſpent. So unleſs you are ſo kind as to aſſiſt me in redeeming it, I know no remedy but to take a purſe.</p>

Dear, Tam, ſince things are thus fallen out, prythee give me leave to wiſh thee joy; I do it <hi>de bon coeur,</hi> ſtrike me dumb! You have married into a family of great politeneſs and uncommon elegance of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and your bride appears to be a lady beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in perſon, modeſt in her deportment, refined in her ſentiments, and of nice morality, ſplit my windpipe!</p>
