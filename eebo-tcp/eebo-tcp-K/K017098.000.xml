            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short ACCOUNT OF A Late Short ADMINISTRATION.</head>
            <p>THE late Adminiſtration came into Employment, under the Mediation of the Duke of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> on the Tenth Day of <hi>July</hi> 1765; and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, upon a Plan ſettled by the Earl of <hi>Chatham</hi> on the Thirtieth Day of <hi>July</hi> 1766, having laſted juſt One Year and Twenty Days.</p>
            <p>In that Space of Time</p>
            <p>The Diſtractions of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire were compoſed, by <hi>The Repeal of the American Stamp Act</hi>;</p>
            <p>But the Conſtitutional Superiority of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was preſerved, by <hi>The Act for ſecuring the Dependance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Private</hi> Houſes were relieved from the Juriſdiction of the Exciſe, by <hi>The Repeal of the Cyder Tax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perſonal Liberty of the Subject was confirmed, by <hi>The Reſolution againſt General Warrants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lawful Secrets of Buſineſs and Friendſhip were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered inviolable by <hi>The Reſolution for condemning the Seizure of Papers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1290601200:3"/>The Trade of <hi>America</hi> was ſet free from injudicious and ruinous Impoſitions — Its Revenue was improved, and ſettled upon a rational Foundation — Its Commerce extended with foreign Countries; while all the Advantages were ſecured to Great Britain, by <hi>The Act for repealing certain Duties, and encouraging, regulating, and ſecuring the Trade of this Kingdom, and the Britiſh Dominions in America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Materials were provided and inſured to our Manufactures— The Sale of theſe Manufactures was encreaſed—The <hi>African</hi> Trade preſerved and extended — The Principles of the Act of Navigation purſued, and the Plan improved — And the Trade for Bullion rendered free, ſecure, and permanent, by <hi>The Act for opening certain Ports in Dominica and Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Adminiſtration was the firſt which propoſed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged public Meetings, and free Conſultations of Merchants from all Parts of the Kingdom; by which Means the trueſt Lights have been received; great Benefits have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready derived to Manufacture and Commerce; and the moſt extenſive Proſpects are open'd for further Improvement.</p>
            <p>Under them, the Intereſts of our Northern and Southern Colonies, before that Time jarring and diſſonant, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, compared, adjuſted, and perfectly reconciled. The Paſſions and Animoſities of the Colonies, by judicious and lenient Meaſures, were allayed and compoſed, and the Foundation laid for a laſting Agreement amongſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1290601200:4"/>Whilſt that Adminiſtration provided for the Liberty and Commerce of their Country, as the true Baſis of its Power, they conſulted its Intereſts, they aſſerted its Honour Abroad, with Temper and with Firmneſs; by making an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Treaty of Commerce with <hi>Ruſſia</hi>; by obtaining a Liquidation of the <hi>Canada</hi> Bills, to the Satisfaction of the Proprietors; by reviving and raiſing from its Aſhes the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the <hi>Manilla</hi> Ranſom, which had been extinguiſhed and abandoned by their Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>They treated their Sovereign with Decency; with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. They diſcountenanced, and, it is hoped, for ever aboliſhed the dangerous and unconſtitutional Practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving military Officers for their Votes in Parliament. They firmly adhered to thoſe Friends of Liberty, who had run all Hazards in its Cauſe, and provided for them in preference to every other Claim.</p>
            <p>With the Earl of <hi>Bute</hi> they had no perſonal Connection; no Correſpondence of Councils. They neither courted him nor perſecuted him. They practiſed no Corruption; nor were they even ſuſpected of it. They ſold no Offices. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no Reverſions or Penſions, either coming in or going out, for themſelves, their Families, or their Dependants.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of their Meaſures they were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed by an Oppoſition of a new and ſingular Character; an Oppoſition of Place-men and Penſioners. They were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Confidence of the Nation. And having held their Offices under many Difficulties and Diſcouragements,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1290601200:5"/>
they left them at the expreſs Command, as they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted them at the earneſt Requeſt of their Royal Maſter.</p>
            <p>Theſe are plain Facts; of a clear and public Nature; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extended by elaborate Reaſoning, or heightened by the Colouring of Eloquence. They are the Services of a ſingle Year.</p>
            <p>The Removal of that Adminiſtration from Power, is not to them premature; ſince they were in Office long enough to accompliſh many Plans of public Utility; and by their Perſeverance and Reſolution, rendered the Way ſmooth and eaſy to their Succeſſors; having left their King and their Country in a much better Condition than they found them. By the Temper they manifeſt, they ſeem to have now no other Wiſh, than that their Succeſſors may do the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as real and as faithful Service as they have done.</p>
