            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE title page announces the termination of my authorial exiſtence, which took place on <hi>March</hi> 1ſt, 1791. Since that period, I have glided through the globe a harmleſs ſprite; have pervaded the continents of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and deſcribed them with the ſame authenticity as <hi>Gemelli Careri,</hi> or many other tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, ideal or real, who are to this day read with avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and quoted with faith. My great change is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by mortal eyes. I ſtill haunt the bench of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. I am now active in haſtening levies of our generous <hi>Britons</hi> into the field. However unequal, I ſtill retain the ſame zeal in the ſervices of my country; and twice ſince my departure, have experienced human paſſions, and have grown indignant at injuries offered to my native land; or have incited a vigorous defence againſt the lunatic deſigns of enthuſiaſtic tyranny, or the preſumptuous plans of fanatical atheiſts to ſpread their reign and force their tenets on the contented moral part of their fellow creatures. May I remain poſſeſſed with
<pb facs="tcp:1233201500:4"/>the ſame paſſions till the great EXORCIST lays me for ever. The two laſt numbers in the following pages are my poſt-exiſtent performances. Surviving friends, ſmile on the attempts! Surviving enemy, if any I can NOW have, forgive my errors!</p>

               <note place="margin">A TOUR IN CORNWAL, 1746 OR 7.</note> A TOUR I made into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> from <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the year 1746 or 1747, gave me a ſtrong paſſion for minerals and foſſils, in which I was greatly encouraged by that able and worthy man, the late reverend doctor <hi>William Borlaſe</hi> of <hi>Ludgvan,</hi> who, in the kindeſt manner, communicated to me every thing worthy my notice.</p>
            <p>THE firſt thing of mine which appeared in print was inſerted unknown to me; an abſtract of a letter I had written to my ever venerated friend and uncle <hi>James Mytton,</hi>eſq. on an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake which was felt at <hi>Downing, April</hi> the 2d, 1750.

               <note place="margin">FOLIO EDITION OF THE BRITISH ZOOLOGY, 1761.</note> About the year 1761 I began my <hi>Britiſh Zoology,</hi> which, when completed, conſiſted of cxxxii plates on imperial paper. They were all engraven by Mr. <hi>Peter Mazel,</hi> now living, and of whoſe ſkill and integrity I had always occaſion to ſpeak well. The painter was Mr. <hi>Peter Pallou,</hi> an excellent artiſt, but too fond of giving gaudy colours to his ſubjects. He painted, for my hall, at <hi>Downing,</hi> ſeveral pictures of birds and animals, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuitable landſcapes. Four were intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the climates. The frigid zone, and an <hi>European</hi> ſcene of a farm-yard, are particularly well done; all have their merit, but occaſion me to lament his conviviality, which affected his circumſtances and abridged his days.</p>
            <p>THE worthy and ingenious <hi>George Edwards,</hi> that admirable ornithologiſt, at firſt conceived a little jealouſy on my attempt: but it very ſoon ſubſided. We became very intimate, and he continued to his dying day ready and earneſt to promote all my labors. He preſented me, as a proof of his friendſhip, with numbers of the original drawings from which his etchings had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1233201500:11"/>been formed. Theſe I keep, not only in reſpect to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but as curious teſtimonies of his faithful and elegant pencil.</p>
            <p>I dedicated the <hi>Britiſh Zoology</hi> to the benefit of the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſchool, near <hi>Gray's-inn-lane, London,</hi> and ſupported the far greater part of the expence. I loſt conſiderably by it, notwithſtanding ſeveral gentlemen contributed. My agent was that very honeſt man, Mr. <hi>Richard Morris,</hi> of the navy office. His widow was left in narrow circumſtances, I therefore permitted her to keep the plates, and make what advantage ſhe could of them. I was, at the time of undertaking this work, unexperienced in theſe affairs, and was ill-adviſed to publiſh on ſuch large paper; had it been originally in quarto, the ſchool would have been conſiderably benefited by it.</p>

He was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my proficiency in natural hiſtory, and publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged his favorable ſentiments of my ſtudies in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth volume of his <hi>Hiſtoire Naturelle.</hi> Unfortunately, long before I had any thoughts of enjoying the honor of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, I had, in my <hi>Britiſh Zoology,</hi> made a compariſon between the free-thinking philoſopher and our great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious countryman Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> much to the advantage of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſubject was a Mole, really too ridiculous to have been
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1233201500:12"/>noticed; but ſuch was his irritability, that, in the firſt volume of his <hi>Hiſtoire Naturelle des Oiſeaux,</hi> he fell on me moſt unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, but happily often without reaſon. He probably relented, for in the following volumes he frequently made uſe of my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which fully atoned for a haſty and miſguided fit of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I did not wiſh to quarrel with a gentleman I truly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, yet, unwilling to remain quite paſſive, in my Index to his admirable works, and the <hi>Planches Enluminécs,</hi> I did venture to repel his principal charge, and, <hi>con amore,</hi> to retaliate on my illuſtrious aſſailant. Our blows were light, and I hope that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us felt any material injury.</p>
            <p>I MUST blame the <hi>Comte</hi> for ſuppreſſing his acknowlegement of ſeveral communications of animals which I ſent to him for the illuſtration of his <hi>Hiſtcire Naturelle.</hi> One was his <hi>Conguar Noir,</hi> Suppl. iii. 223. tab. lxii; my <hi>Jaguar</hi> or <hi>Black Tiger,</hi> Hiſt. Quadr. 1. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 190. Another was the drawing of his <hi>Iſatis,</hi> Suppl. iii. tab. xvii. which he attributes to good <hi>Peter Collinſon.</hi> The third was his <hi>Chacal Adive</hi> of the ſame work, p. 112. tab. xvi; and my <hi>Barbary</hi> Fox, Hiſt. Quadr. 1. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 171, of which I furniſhed him with the deſigns. Theſe are no great matters: I lament them only as ſmall defects in a great character.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">AT MONBARD.</note> I took the uſual road to <hi>Lyon,</hi> excepting a ſmall digreſſion in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in compliance with the friendly invitation of the <hi>Comte,</hi> to paſs a few days with him in his ſeat at <hi>Monbard.</hi> His houſe was built at the foot of a hill crowned with a ruined caſtle: he had converted the caſtle-yard into a garden, and fitted up one of the towers into a ſtudy. To that place he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired every morning, about ſeven o'clock, to compoſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent works, free from all interruption. He continued there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1233201500:13"/>till between one and two, when he returned, dined with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and gave up the whole remainder of the day to them and his friends, whom he entertained with the moſt agreeable and rational converſation.</p>

               <note place="margin">VOLTAIRE.</note> AT <hi>Ferney,</hi> in the extremity of the ſame province, I viſited that wicked wit <hi>Voltaire;</hi> he happened to be in good-humour, and was very entertaining; but, in his attempt to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſatisfied us that he was perfect maſter of our oaths and our curſes.</p>
            <p>THE forenoon was not the proper time to viſit <hi>Voltaire;</hi> he could not bear to have his hours of ſtudy interrupted; this alone was enough to put him in bad humour, and not without reaſon. Leſſer people may have the ſame cauſe of complaint, when a lounger, who has no one thing to do, breaks on their hours of writing, eſtimates the value of their time by his own, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts their attention in the moſt pretious hours of the rural morning.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Lyon</hi> I went to <hi>Grenoble</hi> and the <hi>Grand Chartreuſe, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berri,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and from thence over the greateſt part of <hi>Swiſſerland.</hi> At <hi>Bern</hi> I commenced acquaintance with that excellent man the late baron <hi>Haller,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ulm</hi> and <hi>Augſburg</hi> were the firſt cities I viſited in <hi>Germany. Donawert, Nurenberg, Erlang, Bamberg,</hi> and <hi>Frankfort</hi> on the <hi>Maine</hi> ſucceeded. At the declining city of <hi>Nurenberg</hi> I viſited doctor <hi>Trew,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">DOCTOR TREW.</note> a venerable patron of natural hiſtory. At <hi>Mentz</hi> I embarked on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and fell down that magnificent river

               <note place="margin">DOCTOR PALLAS.</note> I eſteem my meeting with doctor <hi>Pallas,</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> a momentous affair, for it gave riſe to my <hi>Synopſis of Quadrupeds,</hi> and the ſecond edition, under the name of the <hi>Hiſtory of Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds;</hi> a work received by the naturaliſts of different parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in a manner uncommonly favorable. This and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year, doctor <hi>Pallas</hi> reſided at the <hi>Hague.</hi> From conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niality of diſpoſition we ſoon became ſtrongly attached. Our converſation rolled chiefly on natural hiſtory, and, as we were both enthuſiaſtic admirers of our great <hi>Ray,</hi> I propoſed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking a hiſtory of quadrupeds on the ſyſtem of our illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious countryman a little reformed. He aſſented to my plan, and, on <hi>January</hi> the 18th, 1766, he wrote to me a long letter, in which he ſent an outline of his deſign, and his reſolution to purſue it with all the expedition conſiſtent with his other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. But this work was fated to be accompliſhed by an inferior genius. In the next year he returned to <hi>Berlin,</hi> his native place; his abilities began to be highly celebrated; his fame reached the court of <hi>Peterſburgh,</hi> and the empreſs, not more to her own honor than that of my friend, invited him into her ſervice, and in 1768 placed him at the head of one of the philoſophical expeditions projected for diſcovery in the moſt diſtant parts of her vaſt dominions. This was an expedition worthy of <hi>Pallas;</hi> it began in <hi>June</hi> 1768, and was concluded on the 30th of <hi>July</hi> 1774. It unfolded all his great talents, and eſtabliſhed his fame equal at left to the greateſt philoſophers of the age. He was loſt to me during that period. On hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his return I wrote to him at <hi>Peterſburgh,</hi> and ſent to

On <hi>November</hi> the 4th, 1777, I received from him the firſt letter of our renewed correſpondence, which continued ſeveral years, to my great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. He ſuppreſſed nothing that could be of ſervice to the cauſe of literature, nor did he deſiſt, till, overpowered with buſineſs, he dropt all epiſtolary duties except thoſe which were official. To this day he convinces me of his friendſhip by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preſents of the productions of his celebrated pen.</p>

            <p>I MAY here mention, that our firſt acquaintance commenced on <hi>March</hi> 19th, 1766, when he called on me at my lodgings in <hi>St. James's Street,</hi> and preſented me with that ſcarce book <hi>Turner de Avibus,</hi> &amp;c. a gift I retain as a valuable proof of his eſteem.

               <note place="margin">INDIAN ZOOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GY, 1769.</note> MY mind was always in a progreſſive ſtate, it never could ſtagnate; this carried me farther than the limits of our iſland, and made me deſirous of forming a zoology of ſome diſtant country, by which I might relieve my pen by the pleaſure of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1233201500:17"/>the novelty and variety of the ſubjects.

Twelve plates, in ſmall folio, were engraven at the joint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſir <hi>Joſeph Banks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loten,</hi> and myſelf; to which I added deſcriptions and little eſſays.

            <p>ON <hi>May</hi> the 18th, 1772, I began the longeſt of my journies in our iſland. In this year was performed my ſecond tour in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and my voyage to the <hi>Hebrides:</hi> my ſucceſs was equal to my hopes; I pointed out every thing I thought would be of ſervice to the country; it was rouzed to look into its advantages; ſocieties have been formed for the improvements of the fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and for founding of towns in proper places; to all which, I ſincerely wiſh the moſt happy event; vaſt ſums will be flung away; but incidentally numbers will be benefited, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of patriots tickled. I confeſs that my own vanity was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1233201500:23"/>greatly gratified by the compliments paid to me in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated town; <hi>Edinburgh</hi> itſelf preſented me with its freedom, and I returned rich in civic honors.</p>

               <note place="margin">NORTHERN TOUR OF THIS YEAR.</note> THIS likewiſe was a year of great activity. I rode (for almoſt all my tours were on horſeback) to Mr. <hi>Graham</hi>'s of <hi>Netherby,</hi> beyond <hi>Carliſle,</hi> through thoſe parts of <hi>Lancaſhire, Weſtmoreland,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which I had not before ſeen. I viſited <hi>Sefton, Ormſkirk, Blackburne,</hi> and <hi>Clithero,</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire; Malham Coves, Settle,</hi> and <hi>Ingleborough,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire; Kirkby Lonſdale, Kirkby Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Orton,</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland;</hi> and all the counteſs of <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s caſtles in that county; <hi>Naworth, Corbie,</hi> and <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> in <hi>Cumberland.</hi> In my way I ſkirted the weſtern ſide of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> I paſſed ſome hours with the reverend doctor <hi>Burn</hi> at <hi>Orton,</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> a moſt uſeful and worthy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>FROM <hi>Netherby</hi> I croſſed <hi>Alſton Moor</hi> into the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> made ſome ſtay with its prelate, doctor <hi>John Egerton,</hi> and entered <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> after croſing the <hi>Tees</hi> at <hi>Barnard Caſtle.</hi> From thence I viſited <hi>Rokeſby</hi> houſe; <hi>Catterick</hi> bridge; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular circular entrenchments attributed to the <hi>Danes:</hi> the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque <hi>Hackfall,</hi> and the venerable remains of <hi>Fountaine</hi>'s abby. The laſt attracted my attention ſo much that I reviſited them in <hi>May</hi> 1777, and each time they gave full employ to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Moſes Griffith.</hi> He etched two of his drawings: I here give one of the plates, as a ſpecimen of his extenſive genius.</p>
            <p>FROM thence I croſſed to <hi>Boroughbridge</hi> and <hi>Knareſborough.</hi>

            <p>FROM <hi>Harrogate</hi> I rode to <hi>York,</hi> where <hi>Moſes Griffith</hi> was by no means idle. Among many other drawings, I cauſed him, out of veneration to the taſte of Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> to make a ſecond drawing <note n="*" place="bottom">See Memoirs of his Life, &amp;c. p. 294, ſecond edition.</note> of the chapel, ſo much admired by that elegant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. From <hi>York</hi> I rode the great diagonal of the county to <hi>Spurnhead.</hi> Near <hi>Hull,</hi> payed a ſecond time my reſpects to my friend <hi>William Conſtable,</hi>eſq. of <hi>Burton Conſtable,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">WILLIAM CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STABLE, ESQ.</note>, a gentleman the moſt happy in a liberal and munificent turn of mind of any one I know. I kept along the <hi>Humber,</hi> and from its banks went to <hi>Howden, Pontefract, Doncaſter,</hi> and <hi>Kiveton;</hi> viſited <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, Welbeck,</hi> the antient houſe of <hi>Hardwick, Bolſover Caſtle, Derby, Dovedale, Buxton, Leek;</hi> and proceeded by <hi>Congleton</hi> and <hi>Cheſter</hi> to my own houſe. I kept a journal of the whole I mention, as well as numberleſs places which I omit. In every tour I made I kept a regular journal, all which are placed apart in my libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; theſe I wiſh never to be made public, as they may contain inaccuracies, either from haſte or miſinformation: yet, as they contain many deſcriptions of buildings, and accounts of places in the ſtate they were at the time they were made, they ought not totally to be neglected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes Griffiths</hi> made numbers of drawings: my ingenious friend Mr. <hi>Groſe</hi> honored me with uſing ſeveral for his fine work of the Antiquities of <hi>England;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">MR. HUTCHIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON.</note> and I believe Mr. <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinſon,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I COMMENCED a friendſhip with that gentleman in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in a moſt ſingular manner: I was mounted on the famous ſtones in the church-yard of <hi>Penrith,</hi> to take a nearer view of them, and ſee whether the drawing I had procured, done by the rev. doctor <hi>Tod,</hi> had the leſt foundation in truth. Thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, a perſon of good appearance, looking up at me, obſerved "what fine work Mr. <hi>Pennant</hi> had made with thoſe ſtones!" I ſaw he had got into a horrible ſcrape; ſo, unwilling to make bad worſe, deſcended, laid hold of his button, and told him, "I am the man!" After his confuſion was over, I made a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſhook him by the hand, and we became from that moment faſt friends.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject of part of this journey will be found among my poſthumous works, fairly tranſcribed, neatly bound in vellum, and richly illuſtrated with drawings by <hi>Moſes Griffith,</hi> and with prints. This will take in the ſpace from <hi>Downing</hi> to <hi>Orford,</hi> the ſeat of my worthy and venerable friend the late <hi>John Blackburne,</hi>eſq. From thence to <hi>Knowſly, Sephton, Ormſkirk, Latham,</hi> and (croſſing the country) to <hi>Blackborn, Whalley-abby, Ribcheſter, Mitton, Waddington-hall,</hi> and <hi>Clithero,</hi> moſt of them in the county of <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> In that of <hi>York,</hi> I viſited <hi>Sally-abby, Bolton-hall, Malham Coves, Settle, Giggleſwick,</hi> and <hi>Ingleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I THEN croſſed the <hi>Lune</hi> to <hi>Kirkby Lonſdale,</hi> and viſited all the parts of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> omitted in my printed tours of 1769 and 1772: and finally I finiſhed this M.S. vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume at <hi>Alſton,</hi> near the borders of <hi>Durham.</hi> For a more full
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1233201500:27"/>account of my various <hi>poſthuma</hi> I refer the reader to the latter pages of this book.</p>
            <p>IN this year I kept a regular journal of the road between my houſe and <hi>London,</hi> and did the ſame on my return, digreſſing to the right or to the left, as the places which merit notice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to lie.</p>
            <p>I BEGAN the account of this excurſion with ſaying, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all my tours were performed on horſeback; to that, and to the perfect eaſe of mind I enjoyed in theſe pleaſing jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I owe my <hi>viridis ſenectus;</hi> I ſtill retain, as far as poſſible, the ſame ſpecies of removal from place to place. I conſider the abſolute reſignation of one's perſon to the luxury of a carriage, to forebode a very ſhort interval between that, and the vehicle which is to convey us to our laſt ſtage.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Arctic Zoology</hi> gave occaſion to my being honored, in the year 1791, on <hi>April</hi> 15th, by being elected member of the <hi>American</hi> Philoſophical Society at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> (in the preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>David Rittenhouſe,</hi> eſq.) My labors, relative to that vaſt continent, were there favorably received: but this honor I eſteem as a reward above my merits. There, ſcience of every kind begins to flouriſh; among others, that of natural hiſtory;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1233201500:39"/>in which branch I may predict, that my correſpondent and friend doctor <hi>Benjamin Smith Barton</hi> will ſoon riſe into celebrity, and to his pen I truſt the many errors, reſpecting the zoology of his native country, will be corrected with tenderneſs and candor. In regard to the abilities of the ſociety, the volumes of its <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> already publiſhed, are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable proofs.</p>
            <p>IN this year came out a ſecond edition of the firſt volume of my <hi>Tour in Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN <hi>May</hi> 1784, I had the diſtinguiſhed honor of being elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm.</hi> In <hi>Sweden</hi> I am favored with the correſpondence of doctor <hi>Thunberg</hi> of <hi>Upſal,</hi> doctor <hi>Sparman</hi> of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilcke</hi> of the ſame city, and Mr. <hi>Odman</hi> of <hi>Wormden,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Stockholm.</hi> I muſt not forget a grateful tribute to the memory of departed friends, to that of baron de <hi>Geer,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor <hi>Wallerius,</hi> and above all doctor <hi>Solander;</hi> the laſt ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by urbanity of manners, and liberality of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the infinite knowlege he poſſeſſed.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>March</hi> the 5th I received the ſame honor from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Antiquaries at <hi>Perth.</hi>
            </p>

               <note place="margin">TOUR TO THE LAND'S END.</note> EVER ſince the year 1777 I had quite loſt my ſpirit of ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Another happy nuptial connection ſuppreſſed every deſire to leave my fire-ſide. But in the ſpring of this year I was induced once more to renew my journies. My ſon had returned from his firſt tour to the continent, ſo much to my ſatisfaction, that I was determined to give him every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that might qualify him for a ſecond, which he was on the point of taking over the kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> I wiſhed him to make a compariſon of the naval ſtrength and commercial advantages and diſadvantages of our iſland, with thoſe of her two powerful rivals; I attended him down the <hi>Thames;</hi> viſited all our docks; and by land (from <hi>Dartford</hi>) followed the whole coaſt to the very <hi>Land's End.</hi> On his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his ſecond tour, I had great reaſon to boaſt that this excurſion was not thrown away; as to myſelf it was a painful one; long abſence from my family was ſo new to me, that I may ſincerely ſay it caſt an anxiety over the whole journey.</p>
            <p>THESE were my greater labors. I, at ſeveral times, gave to the public ſome trifles, which were not ill-received; but few knew the author. Theſe I collected ſome years ago, <note place="margin">MISCELLANIES.</note> and printed, for the amuſement of a few friends, thirty copies, by the friendly preſs of <hi>George Allan,</hi> eſq. at <hi>Darlington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">HISTORY OF THE PATAGONIANS.</note> THE principal was my hiſtory of the <hi>Patagonians,</hi> collected from the account given by father <hi>Faulkner,</hi> in 1771, and from the ſeveral hiſtories of thoſe people by various writers. I believe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1233201500:41"/>that the authenticity of the ſeveral relaters is now very well eſtabliſhed. This was printed at the ſame preſs, in 1788.</p>
            <p>BESIDES theſe may be added, the <hi>ode on indifference,</hi> and the verſes on the lady being choſen patroneſs of a hunt and book-club in the ſame day.</p>
            <p>AN eſſay on the improper behaviour of married ladies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſex, 1774.</p>
            <p>A RIDICULE on the bold and maſculine faſhion of the ladies wearing riding-habits at all times of the day; which was republiſhed, in 1781, by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> with a good mezzotinto of a modern toilet.</p>
            <p>AMERICAN annals, an incitement to parlement-men to inquire into the conduct of our commanders in the <hi>American</hi> war. I omit this paper, unwilling to revive the memory of the moſt deplorable event in all the annals of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Flintſhire</hi> petition. The diſcontents of the year 1779 were grown to ſuch a height, that the county of <hi>Flint</hi> took ſhare in the attempt to produce a redreſs of grievances. I wiſhed to allay the popular fury as far as in me lay; becauſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the complaints were excited by that bane of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in all ages, pretended patriots. I formed a ſpeech, which I had not courage enough to ſpeak, ſo printed the lenitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as certainly it could do me no diſcredit. The event ſhewed that impoſſibilities were attempted, and that ſoon as the patriots got into power, no more was thought of the plan once urged with much violence.</p>
            <p>AN inſcription over the entrance of the new gaol at <hi>Flint</hi> is printed in Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s account of the principal <hi>Lazarettos</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>THE following grateful epitaph, in memory of my faithful
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1233201500:42"/>ſervant and friend, <hi>Louis Gold,</hi> may be ſeen on a ſmall braſs plate in <hi>Whiteford</hi> church, cloſe to which he was interred, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 22d, 1785.</p>
            <q>This ſmall Monument of eſteem was erected by his lamenting Maſter in Memory of LOUIS GOLD, a Norman by Birth, and above twenty years the faithful Servant and Friend of THOMAS PENNANT, Eſq. of Downing. In his various ſervices he made conſiderable ſavings, which he diſpoſed of by his laſt will (having no relations of his own) with affection to his friends and to his fellow-ſervants, with unmerited gratitude to his Maſter and his family, and with piety to the poor. Every duty of his humble ſtation, and every duty of life, he diſcharged ſo fully, That when the day ſhall come which levels all diſtinction of ranks, He may, By the favour of our bleſſed Mediator. hear theſe joyful words,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1233201500:43"/>"Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." He was born at St. Hermes de Rouvelle, in Normandy, Auguſt 22, 1717; died at Downing, Auguſt 20, 1785; and was interred in the Church-yard near this wall on the 22d of the ſame month.</q>
            <p>PREVIOUS to this I could not, in the warmth of my heart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt giving, in one of the <hi>Cheſter</hi> papers, the following paragraph as a notification of his death.</p>
            <p>
               <q>SATURDAY ſe'nnight, in the morning, died, at <hi>Downing,</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire, Louis Gold,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> by birth, and above twenty years the faithful ſervant and friend of <hi>Thomas Pennant,</hi> of that place, eſq.. He left the ſavings of his different ſervices, which were very conſiderable, to ſeveral of his friends, his fellow-ſervants, and to the poor; and bequeathed to his lamenting maſter, and his four children, handſome remembrances of his affection for them: the remainder to be applied, at the diſcretion of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, to charitable uſes.</q>

As father of a family, landlord of a ſmall but very numerous tenantry, and a not inactive magiſtrate. I had a great ſhare of health during the literary part of my days, much of this was owing to the riding exerciſe of my extenſive tours, to my manner of living, and to my temperance.

            <p>I PUBLISHED, at much expence, in 1777, the <hi>Flora Scotica,</hi> in two volumes, octavo, with xxxvii plates. This was the elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate work of my worthy friend, and fellow traveller, the rev. Mr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>

From <hi>London</hi> I follow the coaſts ſouthern to part of our iſland, and from <hi>Calais,</hi> along the oceanic ſhores of <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> till I have attained thoſe of <hi>New Guinea.</hi> Reſpecting theſe, I have collected every informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſible, from books antient and modern: from the moſt authentic, and from living travellers of the moſt reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of my time. I mingle hiſtory, natural hiſtory, accounts of the coaſts, climates, and every thing which I thought could inſtruct or amuſe. They are written on imperial quarto, and when bound, make a folio of no inconſiderable ſize; and are illuſtrated, at a vaſt expence, by prints taken from books, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1233201500:50"/>by charts and maps, and by drawings by the ſkilful hand of <hi>Moſes Griffith,</hi> and by preſents from friends. With the bare poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the volume relative to <hi>India,</hi> none of theſe books are to be printed in my life-time; but to reſt on my ſhelves, the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my advancing age. The following is the catalogue of theſe labors, all (excepting the firſt) compoſed in the ſpace of four years, all which will be comprehended under the general title of, OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I NOW execute the promiſe I made in town ſome time ago, of communicating to you the reſult of my viſit to Mr. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener,</hi> an antient jeſuit, who had paſſed thirty-eight years of his life in the ſouthern part of <hi>South America,</hi> between the river <hi>la Plata</hi> and the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> Let me endeavor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice you in favor of my new friend, by aſſuring you, that by his long intercourſe with the inhabitants of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> he ſeems to have loſt all <hi>European</hi> guile, and to have acquired all the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and honeſt impetuoſity, of the people he has been ſo long converſant with. I venture to give you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for the authenticity of; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſuch facts as he was eye-witneſs to, and ſuch as will (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) eſtabliſh paſt contradiction the veracity of our late circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigators,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1233201500:56"/>navigators, and give new lights into the manners of this ſingular race of men: it will not, I flatter myſelf, be deemed imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to lay before you a chronological mention of the ſeveral evidences that will tend to prove the exiſtence of a people of a ſupernatural height inhabiting the ſouthern tract. You will find that the majority of voyagers, who have touched on that coaſt, have ſeen them, and made reports of their ſize, that will very well keep in countenance the verbal account given by Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and the printed by Mr. <hi>Clarke:</hi> you will obſerve, that if the old voyagers did exaggerate, it was through the novelty and amazement at ſo ſingular a ſight; but the latter, forewarned by the preceding accounts, ſeem to have made their remarks with coolneſs, and confirmed them by the experiment of meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1519. The firſt who ſaw theſe people was the great <hi>Magellan;</hi> one of them juſt made his appearance on the banks of the river <hi>la Plata,</hi> and then made his retreat: but during <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s long ſtay at <hi>Port St. Julian,</hi> he was viſited by numbers of this tall race. The firſt approached him, ſinging, and flinging the duſt over his head; and ſhewed all ſigns of a mild and peaceable diſpoſition: his viſage was painted; his garment the ſkin of ſome animal neatly ſewed; his arms a ſtout and thick bow, a quiver of long arrows feathered at one end, and armed at the other with flint. The height of theſe people was about ſeven feet, <hi>(French)</hi> but they were not ſo tall as the perſon who approached them firſt, who is repreſented to have been of ſo gigantic a ſize, that <hi>Magellan</hi>'s men did not with their heads reach as high as the waiſt of this <hi>Patagonian.</hi> They had with them beaſts of burden, on which they placed their wives; by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1233201500:57"/>
                  <hi>Magellan</hi>'s deſcription of them, they appear to have been the animals now known by the name of <hi>Llama.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE interviews ended with the captivating two of the people, who were carried away in two different ſhips; but as ſoon as they arrived in the hot climate each of them died.</p>
               <p>I DWELL the longer on this account, as it appears extremely deſerving of credit; as the courage of <hi>Magellan</hi> made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence of ſear: nor could there be any miſtake about the height, as he had not only a long intercourſe with them, but the actual poſſeſſion of two, for a very conſiderable ſpace of time. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Ramuſios</hi> Coll.

               </p>
               <p>It was <hi>Magellan</hi> who firſt gave them the name of <hi>Patagons,</hi> becauſe they wore a ſort of ſlipper made of the ſkin of animals: <hi>Tellement,</hi> ſays <hi>M. de Broſſe</hi>

               </p>
               <p>IN 1525, <hi>Garcia de Louiſa</hi> ſaw, within the ſtreights of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> ſavages of a very great ſtature, but he does not particulariſe their height.</p>
               <p>AFTER <hi>Louiſa</hi> the ſame ſtreights were paſſed in 1535 by <hi>Simon de Alcazova,</hi> and attempted in 1540, by <hi>Alphonſo de Camargo,</hi> but without being viſited by our tall people.</p>
               <p>THE ſame happened to our countryman ſir <hi>Francis Drake;</hi> but, becauſe it was not the fortune of that able and popular ſeaman
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1233201500:58"/>to meet with theſe gigantic people, his contemporaries conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the report as the invention of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN 1579, <hi>Pedro Sarmiento</hi> aſſerts, that thoſe he ſaw were three ells high. This is a writer I would never venture to quote ſingly, for he deſtroys his own credibility by ſaying, the ſavage he made priſoner was an errant <hi>Cyclops:</hi> I only cite him to prove that he had fell in with a tall race, though he mixes fable with truth.</p>
               <p>IN 1586, our countryman, ſir <hi>Thomas Cavendiſh,</hi> in his voyage, had only opportunity of meaſuring one of their footſteps, which was eighteen inches long: he alſo found their graves, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their cuſtoms of burying near the ſhore. <note n="*" place="bottom">Purchas, <hi>i. 58.</hi>

               <p>IN 1591, <hi>Anthony Knevet,</hi> who ſailed with ſir <hi>Thomas Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> in his ſecond voyage, relates, that he ſaw, at <hi>Port Deſire,</hi> men fifteen or ſixteen ſpans high, and that he meaſured the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of two that had been recently buried, which were fourteen ſpans long. <note n="†" place="bottom">Purchas, <hi>i. 1232.</hi>

               <p>IN the ſame year <hi>Oliver du Nort,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> admiral, had a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre with this gigantic race, whom he repreſents to be of a high ſtature and of a terrible aſpect.</p>

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1233201500:59"/>1614.—<hi>George Spilbergen,</hi> another <hi>Dutchman,</hi> in his paſſage through the ſame ſtreight, ſaw a man, of a gigantic ſtature, climbing a hill as if to take a view of the ſhip. <note n="*" place="bottom">Purchas, <hi>i. 80</hi>

               </p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Falkener</hi> ſuppoſes, that formerly there exiſted a race of <hi>Patagonians</hi> ſuperior to theſe in ſize; for ſkeletons are often found of far greater dimenſions, particularly about the river <hi>Texeira.</hi> Perhaps he may have heard of the old tradition of the natives mentioned by, <hi>Cieza</hi>

               <p>1618.—<hi>Gracias de Nodal,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> commander, in the courſe of his voyage, was informed by <hi>John Moore,</hi> one of his crew, who landed between <hi>Cape St. Eſprit,</hi> and <hi>Cape St. Arenas,</hi> on the ſouth ſide of the ſtreights, that he trafficked with a race of men taller, by the head, than the <hi>Europeans.</hi> This, and the next, are the only inſtances I ever met with of the tall race being found on that ſide of the ſtreights.</p>
               <p>1642.—<hi>Henry Brewer,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> admiral, obſerved in the ſtreights <hi>le Maire,</hi> the footſteps of men which meaſured eighteen inches, this is the laſt evidence in the 17th century of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1233201500:60"/>of theſe tall people: but let it be obſerved, that out of the fifteen firſt voyagers who paſſed through the <hi>Magellanic</hi> ſtreights, not ſewer than nine are undeniable witneſſes of the fact we would eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>IN the preſent century I can produce but two evidences of the exiſtence of the tall <hi>Patagonians.</hi> The one in 1704, when the crew of a ſhip belonging to <hi>St. Maloes,</hi> commanded by captain <hi>Harrington,</hi> ſaw ſeven of theſe giants in <hi>Gregory</hi> bay. Mention is alſo made of ſix more being ſeen by captain <hi>Carman,</hi> a native of the ſame town; but whether in the ſame voyage my authority is ſilent. <note n="*" place="bottom">Frezier's Voy. <hi>84.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>BUT as it was not the fortune of the four other voyagers, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> John Narborough, <hi>in 1670;</hi> Bartholomew Sharp, <hi>in 1680;</hi> De Gennes, <hi>in 1696; and</hi> Beaucheſne Gouin, <hi>in 1699.</hi>
                  </note> who ſailed through the ſtreights in the 17th century, to fall in with any of this tall race, it became a faſhion to treat as fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous the account of the preceding nine, and to hold this lofty race as the mere creation of a warm imagination.</p>
               <p>IN ſuch a temper was the public, on the return of Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> from his circumnavigation, in the year 1766. I had not the honor of having perſonal conference with that gentleman, therefore will not repeat the accounts I have been informed he had given to ſeveral of his friends; I rather chuſe to recapitulate that given by Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">This able officer commanded the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> in captain <hi>Cook</hi>'s laſt voyage, and died off <hi>Kamtſchatka, Auguſt</hi> 22, 1779.</note> in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions</hi> for 1767, p. 75. Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> was officer in Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>'s ſhip, landed with him in the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and had for two
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1233201500:61"/>hours an opportunity of ſtanding within a few yards of this race, and ſeeing them examined and meaſured by Mr. <hi>Byron.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents them in general as ſtout and well proportioned, and aſſures us, that none of the men were lower than eight feet, and that ſome even exceeded nine; and that the women were from ſeven feet and an half to eight feet. He ſaw Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> meaſure one of the men, and, notwithſtanding the commodore was near ſix feet high, he could, when on tip-toe, but juſt reach with his hand the top of the <hi>Patagonian</hi>'s head; and Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there were ſeveral taller than him on whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment was made, for there were about five hundred men, women, and children. They ſeemed very happy at the landing of our people, and expreſſed their joy by a rude ſort of ſinging. They were of a copper color, and had long lank hair, and faces hideouſly painted; both ſexes were covered with ſkins, and ſome appeared on horſeback and others on foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. de Premontel</hi> makes this an object of ridicule, as if the ſize of the horſes were unequal to the burden of the riders. Our navigators tell us, that the horſes were fifteen or ſixteen hands high. It is well known, that a mill-horſe has been known to carry nine hundred and ten pounds, a weight probably beyon that of any <hi>Patagonian</hi> they ſaw.</p>
               <p>A FEW had on their legs a ſort of boot, with a ſharp-pointed ſtick at the heel inſtead of a ſpur. Their bridles were made of thong, the bit wood; the ſaddle as artleſs as poſſible, and without ſtirrups. The introduction of horſes into theſe parts by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> introduced likewiſe the only ſpecies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture they appear to be acquainted with. All their ſkill ſeems to extend no farther than theſe rude eſſays at a harneſs;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1233201500:62"/>and to equip themſelves for <hi>Cavaliers.</hi> In other reſpects they would be in the ſame ſtate as our firſt parents juſt turned out of paradiſe, cloathed in coats of ſkins; or at beſt in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which <hi>Caeſar</hi> found the ancient <hi>Britons;</hi> for their dreſs was ſimilar, their hair long, and their bodies, like thoſe of our anceſtors, made terrific by wild painting. Theſe people, by ſome means or other, had acquired a few beads and bracelets; otherwiſe not a ſingle article of <hi>European</hi> fabric appeared among them. Theſe they muſt have gotten by the intercourſe with the other <hi>Indian</hi> tribes: for had they had any intercourſe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they never would have neglected procuring knives, the ſtirrups, and other conveniences which the people ſeen by Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> had.</p>
               <p>I SHOULD have been glad to have cloſed, in this place, the relations of this ſtupendous race of mankind; becauſe the two following accounts given by gentlemen of character and abilities ſeem to contradict great part of what had been before advanced, or at leſt ſerve to give ſcoffers room to ſay, that the preceding navigators had ſeen theſe people through the medium of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying glaſſes, inſtead of the ſober eye of obſervation: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make my remarks on what has been before related, I ſhall proceed with the other navigators, and then attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the different accounts. In 1767, captain <hi>Wallis</hi> of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and captain <hi>Philip Carteret</hi> of the <hi>Swallow</hi> ſloop, ſaw and meaſured with a pole ſeveral of the <hi>Patagonians,</hi> who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan</hi> during his paſſage <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. <hi>1770, p. 21.</hi> Hawkeſworth's Voy. <hi>i. 374.</hi>
                  </note>, he repreſents them as a fine and friendly people, cloathed in ſkins,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1233201500:63"/>and on their legs a ſort of boots, and many of them tied their hair, which was long and black, with a ſort of woven ſtuff of the breadth of a garter, made of ſome kind of wool. That their arms were ſlings formed of two round balls, faſtened one to each end of a cord, which they fling with great force and dexterity. He adds, they hold one ball in their hand, and ſwing the other at the full length of the cord round their head, by which it acquires a prodigious velocity: they will fling it to a great diſtance, and with ſuch exactneſs, as to ſtrike a very ſmall object. Theſe people were alſo mounted on horſes; their ſaddles, bridles, &amp;c. were of their own making; ſome had iron, and others me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bits to their bridles, and one had a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> broad ſword; but whether the laſt articles were taken by war, or procurred by commerce, is uncertain; but the laſt is moſt probable. It ſeems evident that they had intercourſe with <hi>Europeans,</hi> and had even adopted ſome of their faſhions; for many had cut their dreſs into form of <hi>Spaniſh Punchos,</hi> or a ſquare piece of cloth with a hole cut for the head, the reſt hanging looſe as low as the knees. They alſo wore drawers; ſo theſe people had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a few ſteps farther towards civiliſation than their gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic neighbors; others again will appear to have made a far greater advance; for theſe ſtill devoured their meat raw, and drank nothing but water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Bougainville,</hi> in the ſame year, ſaw another party of the natives of <hi>Patagonia:</hi> he meaſured ſeveral of them, and declares that none were lower than five feet five inches, <hi>French,</hi> or taller than five feet ten; <hi>i. e.</hi> five feet ten, or ſix feet three, <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure. He concludes his account with ſaying, that he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1233201500:64"/>met with a taller people in the South Sea, but I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that he mentions the place.</p>
               <p>I AM ſorry to be obliged to remark, in theſe voyages, a very illiberal propenſity to cavil at and invalidate the account given by Mr. <hi>Byron:</hi> but at the ſame time exult in having had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity given me by that gentleman of vindicating his and the national honor. <hi>M. Bougainville,</hi> in order to prove he fell in with the identical people that Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> converſed with, aſſerts, that he ſaw numbers of them poſſeſſed of knives of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, certainly given them by Mr. <hi>Byron;</hi> but he ſhould have conſidered that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing, that the commerce between <hi>Sheffield</hi> and <hi>South America,</hi> through the port of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> is moſt uncommonly large; and that his <hi>Indians</hi> might have got their knives from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the ſame time that they got their gilt nails and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> harneſs: but for farther ſatisfaction on this ſubject, I have liberty to ſay, from Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>'s authority, that he never gave a ſingle knife to the people he ſaw; that he had not one at that time about him; that, excepting the preſents given with his own hands, and the tobacco brought by lieutenant <hi>Cummins,</hi> not the leſt trifle was beſtowed. I am furniſhed with one other proof, that theſe leſſer <hi>Indians,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> ſaw, were not the ſame with thoſe deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> as has been inſinuated: for the firſt had with him ſome officers who had been with him on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding voyage, and who bear witneſs, not only to the difference of ſize, but declare that theſe people had not a ſingle article among them given by Mr. <hi>Byron.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>'s letter at the end.</note>. It is extremely probable
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1233201500:65"/>that theſe were the <hi>Indians</hi> that Mr. <hi>Bougainville</hi> fell in with; for they were furniſhed with bits, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſcymeter, and braſs ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups as before mentioned.</p>
               <p>My laſt evidence of theſe gigantic <hi>Americans</hi> is that which I received from Mr. <hi>Falkener;</hi> he acquainted me, that about the year 1742 he was ſent on a miſſion to the vaſt plains of <hi>Pampas,</hi> which, if I recollect right, lie to the ſouth-weſt of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and extend near a thouſand miles towards the <hi>Andes.</hi> In theſe plains he firſt met with ſome tribes of theſe people, and was taken under the protection of one of the <hi>Caziques.</hi> The remarks he made on their ſize were as follows; that the talleſt, which he meaſured in the ſame manner that Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> did, was ſeven feet eight inches high; that the common height, or middle ſize, was ſix feet; that there were numbers that were even ſhorter; and that the talleſt women did not exceed ſix feet. That they were ſcattered from the foot of the <hi>Andes,</hi> over that vaſt tract which extends to the <hi>Atlantic Ocean,</hi> and are found as far as the <hi>Red River</hi> at <hi>Bay Anagada,</hi> lat. 40. 1; below that the land is too barren to be habitable, and none are found, except accidental migrants, till you arrive at the river <hi>Gallego,</hi> near the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY are ſuppoſed to be a race derived from the <hi>Chilian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> the <hi>Puelches</hi> who inhabited the eaſtern ſide of the <hi>Andes,</hi> the ſame brave nation who defeated and deſtroyed the avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Spaniard Baldivia,</hi> but after that were diſpoſſeſſed of their ſeat.</p>
               <p>THEY dwell in large tents covered with the hides of mares, and divided within into apartments, for the different ranks of the family, by a ſort of blanketing. They are a moſt migratory
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1233201500:66"/>people, and often ſhift their quarters; when the women ſtrike the tents, aſſiſt in putting them on their horſes, and, like the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of all ſavage countries, undergo all the laborious work.</p>
               <p>THEY have two motives for ſhifting their quarters; one, for the ſake of getting ſalt, which they find incruſted in the ſhallow pools near the ſea ſide.</p>
               <p>THE other inducement is the ſuperſtition they have of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dead within a certain diſtance of the ocean. And I may certainly add a third, that of the neceſſity they muſt lie under of ſeeking freſh quarters on account of the chace, which is their principal ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>THOSE who deny the exiſtence of theſe great people, never conſider the migratory nature of the inhabitants of this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious tract, and never reflect that the tribes who may have been ſeen this month on the coaſt, may the next be ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of miles inland, and their place occupied by a tribe or nation totally different. Theſe gentlemen ſeem to lay down as a certain poſition, that <hi>Patagonia</hi> is peopled by only a ſingle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from that falſe principle they draw their arguments, ſneer, inſult, and even groſsly abuſe all that differ in opinion. Among the moſt illiberal of theſe writers is <hi>M. de Premontal,</hi> who, with the rapid ingenuity of his country, mounts on his headſtrong courſer PREJUDICE, ſets off full ſpeed, rides over all the honeſt fellows that would inform him of his road, and ſpurns even Truth herſelf, though ſhe offers to be his guide: but truth is unadorned, and hated by this fantaſtic writer; it would ſpoil him of all the flowers of fiction, and tropes of abuſe, againſt a rival country; and would teach him facts that would ruin his argument,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1233201500:67"/>and reduce his eloquent <hi>memoire</hi> to a ſingle narrative of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted veracity.</p>
               <p>THEIR food is (almoſt entirely) animal: the fleſh of horſes, oxen, guanacoes, and oſtriches, all of which they eat roaſted or boiled. Their drink is water, except in the ſeaſon when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpecies of fruit are ripe, for of thoſe they make a ſort of fermenting liquor called <hi>Chucha,</hi> common to many parts of <hi>South America.</hi> One kind is made of a podded fruit called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garrova,</hi> which ſmells like a bug, and when bruiſed in water becomes an inebriating liquor. The ſame fruit is alſo eaten as bread. The other <hi>Chucha</hi> is made of the <hi>Molie,</hi> a ſmall fruit, hot and ſweet in the mouth: both theſe cauſe a deep drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, eſpecially the laſt, which excites a phrenetic inebriation, and a wildneſs of eyes, which laſts two or three days.</p>
               <p>THE cloathing of theſe people is either a mantle of ſkins, or of a woollen <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Puelches</hi> have no ſheep but what they purchaſe from the <hi>Voluches,</hi> who inhabit the <hi>Andes,</hi> cultivate ſheep, and raiſe corn; the wool is equally fine with that of <hi>Old Spain.</hi>
                  </note> cloth manufactured by themſelves; ſome is ſo ſtrong and compact as even to hold water: the color is various, for ſome are ſtriped and dyed with the richeſt red, made of cochineal and certain roots. They wear a ſhort apron before, which is tucked between the legs, and preſerves a modeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. They never wear feathered ornaments, except in their dances. Their hair is long, and tied up with a fillet. They have naturally beards <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>M. Premontal</hi> roundly aſſerts that they have no beards.</note>, but they generally pluck up the hairs; not but ſome leave muſtaches, as was obſerved by Mr. <hi>Carteret</hi> and <hi>M. Bougainville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1233201500:68"/>WHEN they go to war, they wear a fourfold coat, of the ſkin of the <hi>Tapiir,</hi> a cap of bull's hide doubled, and a broad target of the ſame. Their offenſive weapons are bows and arrows, the laſt headed with bone, lances headed with iron, and broad ſwords, both which they procure from the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> but their native weapons are ſlings; of theſe they have two kinds; one for war, which conſiſts of a thong, headed with ſtone at only one end; and during their campaigns they carry numbers of theſe wrapped about their bodies.</p>
               <p>THE ſlings which they uſe in the chace of horſes, cattle, or oſtriches, have a ſtone fixed to each end; and ſometimes another thong, with a third ſtone, is faſtened to the middle of the other: theſe, with amazing dexterity, they fling round the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the chace, be they beaſts or oſtriches, which entangle them ſo that they cannot ſtir. The <hi>Indians</hi> leave them, I may ſay thus tied neck and heels, and go on in purſuit of freſh game; and, having finiſhed their ſport, return to the animals they left ſecured in the ſlings.</p>
               <p>THEIR wars are chiefly with the other <hi>Indians,</hi> for <hi>Patagonia</hi> is inhabited by variety of people, not a ſingle nation. They have a great deal of intercourſe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and often come down to <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> to trade for iron, bugles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THIS commerce with the <hi>Europeans</hi> has corrupted them greatly, taught them the vice of dram-drinking, and been a dreadful obſtacle to their moral improvement. Mr. <hi>Falkener</hi> informed me, that he once prevaled on about five hundred to form a reduction, but that they grew unruly and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as ſoon as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> traders got among them.</p>
               <p>THEIR war and their chace are carried on on horſeback, for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1233201500:69"/>they are moſt expert riders, and have multitudes of horſes, with which the country is perfectly over-run, for they go in herds of thouſands. The price of a horſe at preſent is two dollars, or 9s. and 2d. provided it has been broken. About the year 1554 <note n="*" place="bottom">Garcilaſſe de la Vega, <hi>377,</hi> Engl. <hi>tranſlation.</hi>
                  </note> near the time of the conqueſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> the common price of one was from four to ſix thouſand to ten thouſand <hi>Peſos</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Peſos</hi> in the original; perhaps <hi>Peſos duros,</hi> which makes the above ſum.</note>, or from £.1350 to £.2250 <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE venereal diſtemper is common among them. They do not ſpeak of it as an exotic diſorder, ſo probably it is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</p>
               <p>IN reſpect to religion, they allow two principles, a good and a bad <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>M. de Premontal</hi> is clear they have no ſort of religion.</note> The good they call, the Creator of all things; but conſider him as one that, after that, never ſolicits himſelf about them. He is ſtyled by ſome <hi>Soucha,</hi> or chief in the land of ſtrong drink; by others <hi>Gauyara-cunnee,</hi> or Lord of the dead. The evil principle is called <hi>Hueccovoe,</hi> or the wanderer without. Sometimes theſe (for there are ſeveral) are ſuppoſed to preſide over particular perſons, protect their own people, or injure others. Theſe are likewiſe called <hi>Valichu,</hi> or dwellers in the air.</p>
               <p>THEY have prieſts and prieſteſſes, whoſe office is to mediate with theſe beings in caſe of ſickneſs or any diſtreſs; by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of the prieſt they are conſulted about future events; at thoſe ſeaſons the prieſt ſhuts himſelf up, and falls into a phre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1233201500:70"/>extacy <note n="*" place="bottom">The pretenders to ſecond ſight, in the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> and the <hi>Awenyddion,</hi> or the <hi>Inſpired,</hi> among the <hi>Welch,</hi> are ſeized with the ſame extaſies.</note> and appears epileptic. If he gives a wrong an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he lays the fault on the evil principle, who, he ſays, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him by not coming in perſon, but only ſent one of his ſlaves. At theſe times the great people aſſemble about the cabin, from whence the oracle is to be delivered, waiting its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with great anxiety.</p>
               <p>IF a <hi>Cazique</hi> dies, or any public calamity happens; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in particular, when the ſmall-pox had made great ravages among the tribes, the prieſts are ſure to ſuffer, for the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is preſumed to have happened through their neglect in not deprecating the evil; in theſe caſes they have no other method of ſaving themſelves, but by laying the blame on others of their brethren.</p>
               <p>PRIESTS are choſen from among the young people, the moſt effeminate they can find; but thoſe that are epileptic have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the preference, and theſe dreſs in a female habit.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Puelches</hi> have a notion of a future ſtate, and imagine that after death they are to be tranſported to a country, where the fruits of inebriation are eternal, there to live in immortal drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs or the perpetual chace of the oſtrich.</p>
               <p>WHEN a perſon of eminence dies, the moſt reſpectable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the place goes into the tent, clears the body of all the inteſtines, and ſcrapes off as much of the fleſh from the bones as poſſible, and then burns very carefully both that and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails: when that is done, the bones are buried till the reſt of the fleſh is quite decayed; they are taken up within a year;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1233201500:71"/>and if any of the bones drop out of their places they are refixed and tied together, and the whole formed into a perfect ſkeleton. Thus complete, it is packed up in a hide, put on the back of a favorite horſe of the deceaſed, and then tranſlated to the tomb of his anceſtor, perhaps 300 miles diſtant, and always within a ſmall ſpace from the ſea.</p>
               <p>THE ſkeleton is then taken out, and, decked in its beſt robes, and adorned with plumes and beads, is placed ſitting in a deep ſquare pit, parallel with thoſe buried before, with ſword, lance, and other weapons placed by them; and the ſkins of their horſes, ſtuffed, and ſupported by ſtakes, alſo accompany them. The top of the pit is then covered with turf, placed on tranſverſe beams.</p>
               <p>A MATRON is appointed to attend theſe ſepulchres, whoſe office it is to keep the ſkeletons clean, and to new-clothe them annually <note n="*" place="bottom">This account agrees with thoſe given by <hi>Lafitau</hi> in moſt particulars; vide <hi>Moeurs des Sauvages,</hi> xi. 438.</note> I forgot to add, that, on depoſiting a ſkeleton in its tomb, the <hi>Puelches</hi> make a libation of <hi>Chucha,</hi> and, like what I have heard of an honeſt <hi>Spaniard,</hi> drink <hi>Viva el morte,</hi> Long live the dead.</p>
               <p>THEY allow polygamy, and marry promiſcuouſly among other <hi>Americans;</hi> they are allowed as many as three wives apiece, but if any take more than that number, he is eſteemed a libertine, and held in very little eſteem.</p>
               <p>WIDOWS black their faces for a year after their huſbands deceaſe.</p>
               <p>IN reſpect to government, the <hi>Caziques</hi> are hereditary, it is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1233201500:72"/>their buſineſs to protect the property of their people, and they have power of life and death: the office is far from being eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; many reject it, becauſe they are obliged to pay all their people for their ſervices, who may at pleaſure change their <hi>Caziques,</hi> ſo that ſeveral refuſe to accept new vaſſals, who may offer themſelves; for it is not allowed any <hi>Indian</hi> to live out of the protection of ſome <hi>Cazique:</hi> in ſuch a caſe he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be looked on as an outlaw.</p>
               <p>ELOQUENCE is in high eſteem with them. If a <hi>Cazique</hi> wants that talent, he keeps an orator; juſt as leaders in oppoſition have been known to do among us.</p>
               <p>THIS cloſes the hiſtory Mr. <hi>Falkener</hi> favored me with; but I muſt not quit that gentleman without informing you, that he returned to <hi>Europe</hi> with a ſuit of <hi>Patagonian</hi> cloth, a cup of horn, and a little pot made of <hi>Chilian</hi> copper; the whole fruits the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left him, after the labors of a thirty-eight years miſſion.</p>
               <p>FROM the preceding account it appears, that the country, which goes under the name of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> extending from the river <hi>la Plata,</hi> lat. 35, to the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> lat. 53 <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>M. de Premontal</hi> will compare <hi>Patagonia</hi> to the ſpace between the <hi>Rivicre des Sardines</hi> and the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan.</hi>
                  </note>, and weſtward as far as the <hi>Andes,</hi> is inhabited by men who may be divided into three different claſſes; and to them may be added a fourth, a combination or mixture of others.</p>
               <p>THE firſt is a race of men of common ſize, who have been ſeen by numbers, and whoſe exiſtence is indiſputable. Theſe often are ſeen on the northern ſide of the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1233201500:73"/>and oftener on the <hi>Terra del Fuego</hi> ſide, even as low as oppoſite to <hi>Cape Horn.</hi> Theſe are frequently an exiled race, unhappy fugitives, drove by their enemies to take ſhelter from their fury, in thoſe diſtant parts; for ſuch is the information Mr. <hi>Falkener</hi> received from ſome <hi>Indians</hi> he met with in the ſouthern parts of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> and this will account for the ſettled melancholy of the people obſerved by the navigators in <hi>Terra del Fuego.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſecond claſs conſiſts of thoſe who (in general) exceed the common height of <hi>Europeans</hi> by a few inches, or perhaps the head; ſuch were thoſe who were ſeen by <hi>John Moore,</hi> who ſailed with <hi>Gracias de Nodal,</hi> in 1618; by Mr. <hi>Carteret,</hi> in 1767, and by <hi>M. Bougainville,</hi> in the ſame year.</p>
               <p>THE third claſs is compoſed of thoſe whoſe height is ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary as to occaſion ſo great a diſbelief of the accounts of voyagers; and yet they are indiſputably an exiſtent people; they have been ſeen by <hi>Magellan,</hi> and ſix others, in the 16th century, and by two if not three in the preſent.</p>
               <p>THE fourth claſs is a mixed race, who, careleſs about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their generous and exalted breed pure and undegenerate, have degraded themſelves by intermixing with the puny tribes of the country, and from that intercourſe have produced a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel breed of every ſize, except that of the original ſtandard; ſome few, as if by accident, ſeem to aſpire to the height of their anceſtors, but are checked in their growth, and ſtop at the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſeven feet eight inches, ſcarce the middle ſize of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine breed. But another reaſon may be aſſigned for the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy and inequality of ſize in this claſs: they live within the neighborhood of <hi>Europeans,</hi> they have intercourſe with them, and from them they have acquired the vice of dram-drinking,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1233201500:74"/>and all its horrible conſequences; this alone is ſufficient to make a nation of giants dwindle into pygmies.</p>
               <p>A THIRD reaſon may ſtill be aſſigned, viz. the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manufactories among them. Thoſe people, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the ſpoils of the chace for their habiliments, were certain of preſerving their full vigor, their ſtrength of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fulneſs of habit; while thoſe who are confined to the loom grow enervate, and loſe much of the force of their bodily faculties. They alſo live in tents lined with woollen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, which doubtleſsly are much more delicate, luxurious, and warm, than the dwellings of the third undegenerate claſs. We are unacquainted with the form of their tents, but we know that they ſtill cloath themſelves with the ſkins of beaſts, and that, among thoſe Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> ſaw, there was not the leſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of manufactury, excepting what related to their horſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. Theſe ſeem to have been the genuine remains of the free race; the conquerors of <hi>Pedro de Baldivia;</hi> the <hi>Puelches,</hi> whoſe original ſtation was among the <hi>Andes</hi> of <hi>Chiloe,</hi> in about latitude 43, and almoſt due eaſt of the iſle of <hi>Chiloe.</hi> Theſe were the deſcendants of the <hi>Indians</hi> who retreated to the ſouth, far out of the common track of <hi>Europeans,</hi> and who retain their primeval grandeur of ſize; the others, who fled north-eaſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of their original magnificent ſtature, loſt in general that noble diſtinction by unſuitable alliances, and the uſe of ſpirits, while the firſt probably only marry among themſelves, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have all ſtrong liquor in abhorrence: ſome of this tall race ſeem ſtill to inhabit the ſtations of their anceſtors, or ſome not very remote from them; for <hi>M. Frezier</hi> was aſſured by <hi>Don Pedro Molina,</hi> governor of <hi>Chiloe,</hi> that he once was viſited by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1233201500:75"/>ſome of theſe people, who were four <hi>varas,</hi> or about nine or ten feet high; they came in company with ſome <hi>Chiloe Indians</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Frezier's Voyage, <hi>page 86.</hi>
                  </note>, with whom they were friends, and who probably found them in ſome of their excurſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. de Premontal</hi> inſults <hi>M. Frezier</hi> with much acrimony on account of this relation; and charges him with changing the ſeat of thoſe people from the eaſtern coaſt to the weſtern, or the tract between <hi>Chiloe</hi> and the <hi>Magellanic</hi> ſtreights; but the truth is, that <hi>Frezier</hi> ſays no ſuch thing, but mentions them as a nation living up the country inland, not near the ſhores; <hi>M. Premontal</hi> alſo ſneers at the evidence of the crews of the <hi>Maloe</hi> ſhips; but they by no means place theſe tall people on the weſtern coaſt of <hi>South America,</hi> but at <hi>Gregory Bay,</hi> a place very little diſtant from the eaſtern entrance of the ſtreights, and near which theſe giants have been more frequently ſeen than any where elſe.</p>
               <p>MY remarks on <hi>M. de Premontal</hi> are but a tribute to the many civilities I have received from doctor <hi>Matie,</hi> who has been moſt unprovokedly, unjuſtly, and illiberally abuſed by this vague and pragmatical writer.</p>
               <p>THUS I conclude all that I collect relating to theſe ſingular people. Let me beg you to receive the account with your uſual candor, and think me, with the moſt regard,</p>

                  <p>THE people I ſaw, upon the coaſt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> were not the ſame that was ſeen the ſecond voyage. One or two of the officers that ſailed with me, and afterwards with captain <hi>Wallace,</hi> declared to me that they had not a ſingle thing I had diſtributed amongſt thoſe I ſaw. <hi>M. Bougainville</hi> remarks that his officers landed amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> I had ſeen, as they had many <hi>Engliſh</hi> knives amongſt them, which were, as he pretends, undoubtedly given by me: now it happened that I never gave a ſingle knife to any of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> nor did I even carry one aſhore with me.</p>
                  <p>I HAD often heard from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that there were two or three different nations of very tall people, the largeſt of which inhabit thoſe immenſe plains at the back of the <hi>Andes.</hi> The others ſomewhere near the river <hi>Galiegos.</hi> I take it to be the former that I ſaw, and for this reaſon:—returning from <hi>Port Famine,</hi> where I had been to wood and water, I ſaw thoſe peoples' fires a long way to the weſtward of where I had left them, and a great way inland, ſo, as the winter was approaching, they were certainly returning to a better cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. I remarked that they had not one ſingle thing amongſt them that ſhewed they ever had any commerce with <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans.</hi> They were certainly of a moſt amazing ſize: ſo much were their horſes diſproportioned, that all the people that were with me in the boats, when very near the ſhore, ſwore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1233201500:77"/>that they were all mounted upon deer; and to this inſtant I believe there is not a man that landed with me, though they were at ſome diſtance from them, but would ſwear they took them to be nine feet high. I do ſuppoſe many of them were between ſeven and eight, and ſtrong in proportion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> is much obliged to Mr. <hi>Pennant</hi> for the peruſal of his manuſcript, and thinks his remarks very judicious.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AT a time in which you feel the diſtreſſes in common with the reſt of the nation, it behoves every one of you to be made acquainted with the laws, in order (as much as is poſſible) to eaſe yourſelves of the burdens under which you labor, and legally to reſiſt every oppreſſion which may be attempted againſt you.</p>
               <p>THE moſt grievous load which you now feel (next to the poor's rate) is that which ariſes from the taxes to ſupport the militia. The laws relating to it are the moſt numerous, and the puniſhments attending the breach of them are ſo hard, that for fear that any of you ſhould offend, by reaſon of ignorance, I ſhall, in the briefeſt manner, ſet before you a few points which concern perſons in every ſtation of life. If I ſhould chance to ſpeak of any piece of hiſtory, or touch on any thing beyond the apprehenſions of any of you, your miniſter is, I truſt, reſident among you, and ready to expound any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>THE militia has been of very long ſtanding in this kingdom; ſeveral ſtatutes were from very old times enacted for its regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. were reviſed, <note place="margin">13, 14 Ch. II. c. 3. Stat. L. iii. 219. Digeſt 1.</note> and a new body of laws framed. Theſe were continued almoſt to the reign of his preſent majeſty; <note place="margin">30 G. II. c. 25. Stat. L. viii. 80.</note> for after they had undergone ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alterations in the latter part of his grandfather's time, they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1233201500:81"/>were totally repealed, and the laws under which we now act were made in their place; but many of the clauſes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſtatute were reſtored. The former is called the <hi>Old Militia.</hi> It certainly was of very little uſe as it then ſtood; but it had one advantage over the preſent; <note place="margin">13, 14 Ch. II. L. iii. ſ. 3.</note> for the expence of raiſing the men was founded on the trueſt juſtice. Thoſe who had great eſtates, palaces, and rich furniture to defend, were charged accordingly. The gentlemen of leſſer fortune, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, were charged leſs; and the honeſt farmer, who had nothing but his rick-yard, the hard fruit of his labor! his poor dwelling, and his coarſe bed, to care about, was only obliged to pay according to ſuch private agreement as might be made between him and his landlord; <note place="margin">The ſame, ſ. 29. Digeſt, p. 8.</note> and all this was done in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary reign of a <hi>Stuart!</hi> But at preſent there is, in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a more levelling principle. The poor laborer is, in ſome caſes, <note place="margin">2 G. III. ſ. 42. Stat. L. viii. 622. Digeſt 6.</note> obliged to contribute ten pounds (if he can raiſe it) towards the defence of the kingdom; and the greateſt ſquire in the principality is not bound to give a farthing more.</p>
               <p>IN the <hi>Old Militia,</hi> all buſineſs relating to the charging the ſubject with finding ſoldiers, was committed to the lieutenant of the county and his deputies, or to the major part of thoſe preſent; <note place="margin">13, 14 Ch. II. c. 3. ſ. 3. Stat. L. iii. 219. Digeſt 3.</note> or, in the abſence of the lieutenant, to the major part of the deputy lieutenants then preſent; which major part was to be <hi>three at leſt.</hi> I am ſorry to remark, that even at the firſt framing of the new militia, this important ſecurity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the poor ſubject was weakened: <note place="margin">2 G. III. ſ. 58. Stat. L. viii. 624.</note> for the powers were in that act entruſted to three deputy lieutenants or juſtices only; and ſince that time, <note place="margin">18 G. III. c. 59. ſ. 11. Stat. L. xiii. 288. Digeſt 47.</note> the number (when the militia is in actual ſervice) is reduced to two only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1233201500:82"/>THIS has been a moſt dangerous and imprudent alteration. Every one knows the hazard of truſting power in few hands. Friendſhip, relationſhip, or an unfortunate congenial turn of mind, may be found in two, which will hardly be met with in a greater number. In fact, two may become but as one, and this reduction be productive of the moſt ſhameful abuſes.</p>
               <p>BUT if it were poſſible, that a gentleman ſhould ſo far forget the duty he owes to his country, as to adopt a ſyſtem, in the moſt diſtant view productive of a military government; ſhould he, through miſtaken friendſhip, promote or ſecond any illega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of proceeding; Heaven have mercy upon poor <hi>Britain!</hi> Not the increaſing power of the crown; not the machinations of a faction; not the corruption of a parlement, will half ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ruin its conſtitution. Not the force of man can overturn it, if the civil powers are true to their truſt: nor leſs than the intervention of Heaven preſerve it, if they are falſe.</p>
               <p>AT preſent perhaps no danger is to be apprehended; but, for the ſake of poſterity, let us guard againſt events; and remember, that <q>an attack by ſtorm may be repulſed, but an unſuſpected ſap is ſure in the end to overturn the ſtrongeſt works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is the militia at preſent that pure aſſemblage of men of rank, fortune, and independence, as it was in the beginning? It may conſiſt of perſons of equal integrity. But is it not poſſible that a few may have crept in, deſtitute of qualification, or deſtitute of heads ſteady enough to bear the great trial of power? Are there no inſtances of their carrying the controul of the camp into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life; none, of their ruffling the tranquillity of the ſocial hour, clouding the bright moments of the gay aſſembly; or pre|
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1233201500:83"/>venting the impending nap of the quiet magiſtrate, who dared to differ in opinion with them?</p>
               <p>I SHALL make no remarks on the method of ballotting, except this: that a power is given to the deputy lieutenants and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices to order a freſh ballot, in caſe the lot falls on any perſon who, <note place="margin">18 G. III. c. 14 <note n="*" place="bottom">Abridged, and part of the clauſe omitted, in Mr. <hi>Rufſhead</hi>'s edition. See vol. xiii. 181.</note>. Digeſt, ed. 1778. p. 52.</note> by reaſon of infirmity, or want of ſize, is unfit to ſerve. This is extremely juſt: yet ſtrict attention ſhould be paid to this power; leaſt through too great nicety in the gentlemen, or too great favor to the commanding officer, they ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to reject thoſe to whom nothing but the moſt trivial, or perhaps affected objections could be made. Beſides, it moſt commonly happens, that on the day of appeal the liſts are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cleared from all objectionable perſons. For the ſake of the people therefore, a ſevere penalty ſhould be enacted, as a guard againſt the abuſe of this power.</p>
               <p>IF any of you who are ballotted, do not chuſe to ſerve, you have liberty of offering a ſubſtitute; and that ſubſtitute muſt be five feet four inches high, and fit for ſervice. You muſt offer none but ſuch who are active in body and ſound in mind: who can fully anſwer the purpoſe for which they are called out, that of defending our wives, children, and property. You muſt offer ſuch who will not ſhame you in diſtant counties, or give needleſs trouble to the gentlemen who command them, and who have, in many inſtances, for all our ſakes, given up for a time every comfort of a domeſtic life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1233201500:84"/>IF you happen to be ſix feet high, and formed as perfect as man can be, the magiſtrates ought not to refuſe a ſubſtitute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to you in thoſe advantages; it may be your good (or I may ſay in this caſe) your ill fortune to be ſo made: but ſtill they ought not to refuſe any one you offer, who comes within the above deſcription. Two deputy lieutenants, or one deputy lieutenant and one juſtice, have power to accept or refuſe them. If theſe two are reſolved to plague you, by the refuſal of proper ſubſtitutes, look about the room, and ſee if there are any others preſent, and pérhaps by their interference the former may be ſhamed into compliance; for there are none but have eyes as well as they, to diſcern whether a man is five feet four, and proper to be accepted; and ſenſe enough to know (in caſes where a ſubſtitute is accepted) that a ſingle man will be leſs burdenſome to a pariſh than a married man. A merciful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate will ſurely never heſitate to prefer the former?</p>
               <p>THE poſſible abuſe of the power of rejection, or acceptance of ſubſtitutes, when lodged in two only, ſhews the neceſſity of reſuming the antient mode, and of enlarging the number. At preſent, let the power be ever ſo much abuſed, you are left help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in this act, for there is no puniſhment for thoſe who make ſo wanton an exertion of it.</p>
               <p>BUT remember, that in caſe you are at length teized, by the refuſal of ſeveral ſtout ſubſtitutes, into the payment of ten pounds (which, properly ſpeaking, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 42. Stat. L. viii. 622.</note> is only to be levied in caſe you refuſe or neglect to provide a man in your room) remember, I ſay, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. s;. 51. Stat. L. viii. 624. Digeſt 57.</note> that you are to pay the money into the hands of the church-wardens and overſeers of your reſpective pariſhes only, who are alſo the only perſons appointed by law to receive and pay the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1233201500:85"/>ten pounds, or to agree or contract for any ſubſtitutes, unleſs you ſhould chuſe to do it yourſelves, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 52. Digeſt 58.</note> or ſhould chuſe to employ any friend to do it for you.</p>
               <p>AND obſerve, that in caſe any of the deputies or juſtices, or even the lord lieutenant himſelf, ſhould offend in any article of the above clauſe, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 51. Stat. L. viii. 624. Digeſt 57, 58.</note> you may lay an information againſt him, and he is liable to be fined <hi>one hundred pounds:</hi> half of which is to be paid to the proſecutor, and half to the poor of the pariſh in which the offence was committed; and you may recover it in any of his majeſty's courts of record.</p>
               <p>IF any deputy or juſtice demands and gets from you more than ten pounds, the offence becomes the dirty crime of extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Will not the world ſay, that the offender ſinks the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the generous <hi>Britiſh</hi> gentleman, or brave officer, into that of the recruiting ſerjeant; and that he forfeits the confidence of his poor countrymen, who look up to him for protection from every wrong? But you may have more ſubſtantial ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; you may bring an action againſt him, expoſe him in a court of juſtice, and recover full damages. This may atone for the private injury: but the public wrong is of that moment, as only to be expiated before one of our higheſt tribunals; and with all the ſolemnity of public juſtice.</p>
               <p>THERE is not one of your fellow-ſubjects, let him be ever ſo great, that can levy on you a farthing more than the law allows. One of our kings loſt his head for trying to raiſe money without conſent of parlement. Surely you have more ſpirit than to ſuffer any private man to tax you of his own authority? At the ſame time you muſt pay quietly the ten pounds penalty; but only in caſe you have by law incurred it. But remember, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1233201500:86"/>this payment does not exempt you from ſerving again at the end of the three years, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 42. Stat. L. viii. 622.</note> or from providing a ſubſtitute.</p>
               <p>THE militia is our great and conſtitutional ſecurity: it is the intereſt of us all to preſerve this bulwark of our freedom; but let us all take care that, what was ſo ſtudiouſly intended to be the guardian of our liberties, become not the inſtrument of our ſlavery, in the hands of men who know not the true uſe of power.</p>
               <p>IF it was poſſible that any deputy or juſtice ſhould refuſe your ſubſtitutes, and immediately after take thoſe very men in the room of other ballotted people, let his ſhame be his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for I fear that the act provides none. But as the preciſe deſcription of fit or unfit is quite unſettled, you will, in ſuch an inſtance, have the comfort of being aſſured by the very magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates themſelves, that you never wiſhed to affront them by the offer of inſufficient people.</p>
               <p>IF a poor man is made deſperate by the rejection of ſeveral fit ſubſtitutes, and by the inability of paying the ten pounds, and afterwards abſconds, he is liable to a more ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: how far it may exceed the offence, I ſubmit to public judgment. At firſt the law provided one which ſeemed equal to the fault, which was a fine of ten pounds, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 42, 128. Stat. L. viii. 621, 637.</note> or for want of diſtreſs, impriſonment in the common jail, there to live for three months among felons, and ſtarve; for I ſuſpect that he is in a worſe ſituation than them, not being comprehended within the king's or county allowance, which the vileſt of felons are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to.</p>
               <p>THIS clauſe was repealed, and the unhappy wretch is, in time of actual ſervice, liable to be ſeized, his name entered on the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1233201500:87"/>roll, be delivered to an officer of the corps he was ballotted for, torn from his family, hand-cuffed, and marched perhaps two hundred miles acroſs the country; <note place="margin">19 G. III. c. 72. ſ. 22. Stat. L. xiii. 485, Digeſt 62.</note> then to ſerve three years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perhaps an irritated commander: and ſhould he again ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond, be liable to the infamy of whipping, or to be ſhot like the moſt profligate deſerter. In the name of Heaven! let this clauſe be for ever blotted from our ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>THIS merits the more attention, becauſe nothing is eaſier to a mercileſs magiſtrate, than to bring a man within this clauſe. A poor creature may be able to raiſe ſix or ſeven pounds to give to the ſubſtitute whom he has engaged, and yet, with all his endeavours, not be able to raiſe ten pounds. The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates refuſe his ſubſtitutes, and finding neither money or effects to the value of ten pounds, inſtantly convict him of the crime of poverty, and he ſuffers accordingly. Or, he may not be a houſeholder, yet be able to pay the ten pounds; but through indignation at the treatment he has received, by the rejection of his ſubſtitutes, refuſes to depoſit the money, and having no effects, is in like manner ſubject to puniſhment.</p>
               <p>IN caſe any militia man is diſapproved by the commanding officer, <note place="margin">19 G. III. c. 72. ſ. 23. Stat. L. xiii. 485. Digeſt 55, 56.</note> after being enrolled, it is lawful for the officer to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him; but he muſt give his reaſons in writing, and be aſſiſted by two deputy lieutenants: ſo attentive, in this inſtance, have our law-givers been to the prevention of abuſe in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power! Why have they been ſo remiſs in the former far more important matter?</p>
               <p>PLEASE to obſerve, that throughout the militia act, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer is diſtinguiſhed from the civil power, or the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1233201500:88"/>deputy lieutenants and juſtices of the peace. <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 28. Stat. L. viii. 618. Digeſt 36.</note> The lord lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant alone is permitted to act as colonel: he alone is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to unite the civil and military characters, becauſe he can delegate his powers ſo that his abſence may be diſpenſed with. In every other inſtance, they are ſo very carefully ſeparated, as never to appear acting together; except in the inſtance of the diſcharge of a man, in which they have a ſhort correſpondence. The law plainly deſigns, that no perſon inferior to the lord lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, ſhould act in both capacities; much leſs to preſide at the meetings, and brow-beat the deputy lieutenants or juſtices in the diſcharge of their duty. <q>A prince, therefore, never ſhould give to military men a civil employment: on the contrary, they ought to be checked by the civil magiſtrate, that the ſame perſons may not have the confidence of the people, and the power to abuſe it <note n="*" place="bottom">Monteſquieu.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE civil power is the ſoul which is to animate the military machine, and put it in motion. <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 95. Stat. L. xiii. 631. Digeſt 72.</note> The civil power forms the men into regiments, or in ſmall counties into companies; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles men in convenient ſtations, and even poſts to each company its proper officers.</p>
               <p>THE time of training and exerciſing the men, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 99. Stat. L. viii. 632. Digeſt 74.</note> and the place of rendezvous, is alſo entirely in the power of the lieutenant and two deputies; or, in the abſence of the lieutenant, in that of three deputy lieutenants: <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 116. 16 G. III. c. 3. ſ. 1. Stat. L. xiii. 634. xii. 431. Digeſt 98.</note> and the power of embodying the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia is entruſted to the ſame, even in time of actual invaſion, or in caſe of rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1233201500:89"/>IN a few words; it does not appear that the commanding officer has ſcarcely any part to perform till he takes the field: the ballotting, the approving, and the rejecting of volunteers or ſubſtitutes, reſting entirely in the civil magiſtrates. The power of the commandant does not commence till, at ſooneſt, the time of enrolling; for within a month after that, he is at liberty to correct the choice of the deputy lieutenants, and to diſcharge any man whom they have ſuffered to paſs muſter, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 48. Stat. L. viii. 623. Digeſt 102.</note> and who is really unfit for ſervice.</p>
               <p>GOOD manners, and even prudence, ſhould induce the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to invite any diſcreet officer of the corps to attend the meeting for accepting of ſubſtitutes: or, if the corps is too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, prudence ſhould urge them to do the ſame to any fit offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of a neighboring corps, be it regular or militia. They ought not; they cannot be partakers of the power entruſted to the civil magiſtrates: but they may be uſefully conſulted on any caſes of acceptance, in which the magiſtrates may have doubts. Every officer is equally a citizen of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and I dare to ſay, on this occaſion would, in his advice, not forget that moſt important character.</p>
               <p>THE power given to the commandant, of diſcharging any man he diſlikes in one month after enrolling, ſhews, that it is not ſuppoſed he could be preſent at the ballot, or could have any concern in approving of the ſubſtitutes; otherwiſe, he could not poſſibly receive improper men one week, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 128. Stat. L. viii. 637. Digeſt 61.</note> I SHALL cloſe this ſuſpicion of the probability of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer's being excluded from all concern in the raiſing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1233201500:90"/>of the militia, with this remark, that the overplus of the penalty of ten pounds, if any remains, is to be paid by the deputy lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and juſtices to the clerk of the regiment or battalion <note n="*" place="bottom">By the by, an omiſſion in the Digeſt.</note>, who is to account for it to the colonel or commanding officer; a direction which ſufficiently points out the difference of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and diſtinction of the department.</p>
               <p>MANY of you, in order to eaſe yourſelves of expence, have formed clubs, in which every perſon liable to be ballotted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſmall ſum, and raiſed ſufficient to find a ſubſtitute, in caſe the lot fell on any one of the members. By this means you prevented a heavy load from falling on all ſuch, who by reaſon of ſickneſs, or any other infirmity, were excepted from ſerving; but not from the taxes attendant on the militia. This you did freely: and in caſe the lot fell upon any one of you who choſe to ſerve, you made uſe of the club-money, and ſcorned to put your poor neighbors (for whom you were going to fight) to any more expence than the ſupport of your families.</p>
               <p>THE law, by a very particular clauſe, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 53. Stat. L. viii. 624. Digeſt 58.</note> encourages the uſe of theſe clubs, and as it were, renders optional the uſe of a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going clauſe; and prevents it from being made burdenſome to any pariſhes, except thoſe which have been imprudent enough not to form theſe clubs, in eaſe to themſelves. But to levy the tax of half the price of a volunteer, as that clauſe directs, <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 47. 19 G. III. c. 72. Digeſt 101. Stat. L. viii. 623. xiii. 483.</note> is a mere wanton exertion of power, in all places where clubs have been eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1233201500:91"/>HALF the price of a volunteer has been generally fixed at four guineas, or four and a half: yet I have known, in the very week in which ten or twelve guineas have been prodigally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on a ſubſtitute, men equally good have been inliſted in the regulars for four; and within five weeks after enrolling, a militia ſubſtitute to ſupply a vacancy has been got by one of the pariſhes for four only.</p>
               <p>IN caſe half the price of a volunteer is to be raiſed on the country, you have an indulgence of deferring the payment one whole month. Among other reaſons, is this; it gives time to the overſeers of the poor, who are charged with the payment, to collect the money from their poor brethren, it being well known that many who are thus taxed are worſe off than thoſe for whoſe uſe the money is raiſed. Perhaps almoſt the whole month may be required for the diſtreſſed tenant to get in a little money, notwithſtanding all the trouble and ill-will the overſeer has in diſcharge of his office.</p>
               <p>BUT our law-makers had another reaſon for giving you a month's time for the payment; becauſe (as I ſaid before) the commanding officer has power to diſcharge any man he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes within one month after enrolling, <note place="margin">The ſame, Sect. 48 in one, 14 in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and then no ſuch money is to be paid to that perſon, but to the next choſen by lot in his ſtead. Now it may happen, that if you pay it to the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on, or ſoon after the day of enrolling, he may die within the month, or he may be diſcharged, and in the laſt caſe moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may have ſpent the money; in ſo much that the pariſh muſt pay the ſame ſum over again to the next perſon, who is as liable to be diſcharged within a day or two, as the other, and the pariſh
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1233201500:92"/>put, without remedy, to freſh expences. Never, therefore, pay the money till the end of the month, and you will be on the ſure ſide, and within the meaning of the law.</p>
               <p>YOU need not fear being put to the expence of maintaining the wives or children of the ſerjeants. In one of your counties, two well-meaning magiſtrates made the trial, but when their order came to the clerk of the peace, who is a very honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he took it, and the matter was totally ſuppreſſed. <note place="margin">2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 114. Digeſt 84. St. L. viii. 634. 2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 38. Digeſt 38. Stat. L. viii. 619. 2 G. III. c. 20. ſ. 39. Digeſt 39.</note> One ſhould have thought it impoſſible that they could miſtake a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commiſſion officer for a common man, or not have read, that ſerjeants were appointed from among the common men, and were, on any miſconduct, liable to be reduced to the rank of common men.</p>
               <p>THE above is the only perſonal alluſion in this little piece: but I hope I may make free with myſelf, and thus with ſhame and contrition perform my <hi>amende honorable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF any of you are oppreſſed in any manner whatſoever, do not deſpair of relief. Remember you live in a free country, where juſtice is open to the poor as well as the rich. It is not many years ago ſince a great lord, a ſecretary of ſtate, made the ſame miſtake as moſt country juſtices have done, and iſſued a general warrant againſt a private gentleman; who had ſpirit to take the law of his lordſhip, and recovered four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds damage. And I remember a cobler near <hi>London,</hi> who went to law with a former king for a foot-path, and caſt his majeſty.</p>
               <p>BUT let the law be your laſt reſource. I have not the moſt diſtant thought of ſetting you and the gentry at variance. They
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1233201500:93"/>are bound to give you protection by the duties of humanity: by their duty as magiſtrates. They are bound by their oaths <q>
                     <hi>to do equal juſtice to the poor and to the rich, after their cunning wit and power, and after the laws and cuſtoms of the realm, and the ſtatutes thereof made.</hi>
                  </q> You are bound to pay to them a manly reſpect; for on their integrity, knowlege, and power, YOUR OWN SAFETY DEPENDS. <hi>In our ſeveral ſtations we are</hi> ALL BOUND TO BE PROTECTIONS <hi>one to the other.</hi> If any of them, through heat, or forgetfulneſs of the law, ſhould have injured you, apply for redreſs in a private manner. I truſt that there are in every <hi>Welſh</hi> county ſome worthy gentlemen who will undertake your cauſe, and perform the bleſſed office of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. Thoſe who may have wronged you, need not be aſhamed of making the pooreſt of you amends. Reparation of an injury does honor to the offender, and wipes away the offence. The greateſt man in <hi>England</hi> may glory in the opportunity.</p>
               <p>IN diſtracted times, ſuch as the preſent, petty tyrants are apt to ariſe, who think they can act ſecure in the rage of the ſtorm, The watchman is not to be blamed who, in ſuſpicious ſeaſons, gives the alarm on the ſight of the riſing of a diſtant duſt. I hope, therefore, it will not be thought preſumptuous in me, unbidden, to take the office. Internal impulſes to prevent evils, ought not to be reſiſted. I am not a firſt-rate man among you: but a pygmy armed by juſtice goes forth a giant. Within the county in which I am deſtined to act, I am in a particular manner bound to befriend you; to befriend you in a good cauſe: but if you are wrong, and obſtinately wrong, my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhall be uſed to inflict on you every puniſhment in the power of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1233201500:94"/>BUT I hope that peace and mutual confidence will ever reign among us; and that rich and poor will, as is their joint intereſt, endeavour to promote, to the utmoſt of their abilities, RESPECT TO THE LAWS, AND RESPECT TO TRUE LIBERTY. Such,</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM obliged to you for your favor of <hi>January</hi> 24th, and ſhould have been extremely happy to have received an anſwer a little more ſatisfactory. I am moſt willing to believe that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns may at this time be pure, that you have no thought to eradicate monarchy, no more than hundreds of great characters had in the beginning of the troubles of the laſt century, but by the artifices of the popular leaders, they were drawn from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to violence, till their retreat became impracticable; and when they made the attempt, they were overwhelmed by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny which they unwittingly had helped to eſtabliſh, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1233201500:98"/>which ſoon after totally ſubverted the conſtitution <note n="*" place="bottom">A fimilar inſtance unhappily may be given in our times, when numbers of the firſt national aſſembly of <hi>France</hi> have been maſſacred by the very people they labored to free from one of the worſt of governments!</note>. You ſeem ſhocked at the idea, and are ready to ſay with <hi>Hazael,</hi> "Is thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant a dog, that he ſhould do theſe things?" What is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our kingdom, but the wiſe mixture of King, Lords, and Commons, each one deſigned to be a check on the ill-conduct of the others: if you deſtroy the powers of any one, and the others ſhould unite, you eſtabliſh the moſt abſolute deſpotiſm, for you take away the ſalutary control of the third. Your ſaying that the preſent majority is not anti-monarchial is ſaying nothing; for if you deprive the King of the power of chuſing his own ſervants, or of the other great executive privilege of appointing to places, you make him merely nominal; an arrant King Log.</p>
               <p>Within theſe two months the above has been (as yet happily) in vain attempted; firſt in the endeavour to place in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the diſpoſition of places in <hi>India</hi> and all its vaſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies; ſecondly, in the interference of Lord ****, in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> thirdly, in the preſent attempt to wreſt from Majeſty the undoubted right of chuſing his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: let theſe points be gained by the Commons, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy falls. Have your leaders informed you what govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they mean to eſtabliſh? If prerogative is deſtroyed, this cannot ſubſiſt; for I think the King will never ſubmit to be brought from his priſon at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, with the pageantry of majeſty, to give his aſſent to acts ſignified by the pleaſure of the Commons. I truſt that we both look with equal horror on a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1233201500:99"/>King without Commons, as Commons without King. The pernicious reſolutions of <hi>January</hi> the twelfth are without prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe unprovoked; the cauſe ought to have been of the firſt magnitude to have produced ſuch effects, which involve all ranks in their deſtructive conſequence. They are like a ſword which paſſes undiſtinguiſhed between innocent and guilty. Your conſtituents feel their ſhare. All buſineſs is obſtructed, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in a few days the whole army is to be let looſe on their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects. What crime has majeſty or miniſters committed, to bring on them and our country ſuch calamities? Has not year after year the King quietly aſſented to every bill paſſed by the two other branches of legiſlature for the weakening of his own power? Had he had ill deſigns, his own prerogative might have checked the abridgement of his authority. I inſtance only the act for taking away the vote of revenue officers, and that for the abolition of the board of trade. The county of **** with great zeal petitioned for the taking away of uſeleſs places. Had the inciters of thoſe petitions, when they came into power, purſued the deſign with the ſame ſincerity with which they were ſupported by the duped counties, they would not have leſt room to ſuſpect that the deſire of poſſeſſing the emoluments of Lord <hi>North</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration was not the chief end by them propoſed. Let me name another merit of this reign, for the ſecurity of our liberties, in which the Commons had no ſhare, I mean the ſpontaneous act of the crown which has made the judges independent of the King by giving them their places for life.</p>
               <p>To theſe merits of the King, let me oppoſe one glaring deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Commons. Did not the repreſentatives of the people, in 1716, betray their rights by the ſeptennial act, and veſt in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1233201500:100"/>themſelves four years more of power than the conſtitution or their conſtituents ever intended? I will not enter into a diſcuſſion of the eventual good or evil. The charge ought to be ſubject of deep conſideration with electors and elected. But if it was wrong, is not the preſent majority <hi>particeps criminis,</hi> by permitting it to continue unrepealed? But does there not appear the greater probability of its deſign of aſſuming a far longer continuance of its own power, ſhould it not be appalled by the warning voice of the people? I cannot give it a grain of credit for any one act of forbearance, any pretended moderation, ſince the awful ſound begins to roll over its head.</p>
               <p>THE King has lately dared to make uſe of his prerogative, in diſmiſſing his late ſervants, for unconſtitutionally trying to divert into another branch of the legiſlature his great prerogative of the diſpoſal of places. Pleaſe to apprehend <hi>that</hi> to be the only part of Mr. <hi>Fox's India</hi> bill to which I make any objection. I ſhould hold chartered rights moſt ſacred; but not ſuch which have affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lives and properties of millions, in the manner in which the abuſe of power is pretended to have done in our <hi>Indian</hi> empire.</p>
               <p>IN place of the miniſtry diſmiſſed, his majeſty has been pleaſed to put at the head of the new one a youth endued, I may ſay, with miraculous abilities; one in whom malice can find as few defects as can be found in human nature. When I had the honor of ſpeaking to you on the ſubject of his virtues, in the ſhort converſation I had with you in your way to town, you ſeemed to have had no objection to him. Has his ſhort admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration been marked by any flagitious deed? Would it not have been fair to have given the man of the King's choice a ſhort trial? Or, is it not becauſe he is the man of the King's
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1233201500:101"/>choice that the majority of mouths are open againſt him? I hope his virtues are not the object of jealouſy, and that the eloquence of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> is not to bear down the virtues of <hi>Ariſtides!</hi> ſurely the majority do not ſign the ſhell becauſe they are angry at every body calling <hi>Ariſtides</hi> juſt?</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY there are ſtrong contraſts to his character, who unite their force to pull him down. Why ſhould the affairs of the whole nation be ſtopped at the inſtance of ſuch perſons? Could you not ſuffer the buſineſs to go on, with only the proper objections to what was wrong? Surely the taxes might have paſſed, in order to prevent what may poſſibly enſue, univerſal bankruptcy. But moderation muſt not be adopted; it will ſuit neither the views nor intereſts of a ſet of men, whom po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and ambition have made nearly deſperate. The nonſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical exploded cry of ſecret influence is for private ends again revived.</p>
               <p>EXCUSE me for reminding you (but remind you I muſt) of the declaration you made at the laſt general election, that you would enliſt under no party, follow no ſet of men; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is far from impracticable; many illuſtrious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who obſerve thoſe excellent rules, exiſt at this very time. Your conſtituents wiſh you to do the ſame. They wiſh to prevale on you to compare your ſentiments with theirs; the ſooner it is done, the leſs will be the violence of the alteration. I firſt ſuggeſted the communication of our ſentiments, and from my model (ſuch as is incloſed) is drawn the declaration which I apprehend has by this time been ſent to you from the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ****, with the approbation of many reſpected charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this end of the county. You need not ſtart at the teſt offered to you. It is not deſigned to bind you to any party,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1233201500:102"/>to any ſet of men. It contains only conſtitutional fundamentals, ſuch as you might ſubſcribe without any derogation from your honor. If the name offends, change it to 'inſtructions,' and the offence is done away. Why ſhould the majority be alarmed at ſubſcribing to undeniable duties, who are daily offering to their Sovereign the moſt mortifying covenants? This ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh nicety reminds me of the giant in <hi>Rabelais,</hi> who daily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed wind-mills for his breakfaſt, and at laſt was choaked with a lump of butter before the mouth of a warm oven.</p>
               <p>To conclude: there is not a wiſh to change our repreſentative, provided he acts conſonant to our principles; but none of us ought to give up principle for affection. I truſt that your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will be clear and decided; ſo that in ſupporting you we ſhall ſupport the dictates of our own conſciences. The great majority of your conſtituents are firm friends to the legal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. They will re-elect you; yet how muſt they bluſh at their inconſiſtency if you take an adverſe part! I have been your friend, and I ſhall be ſorry to withdraw my intereſt from you. Excuſe me again if I ſay, with the ſpirit of a freeman, this muſt reſt in yourſelf. If we differ in ſentiments, there ought to be mutual forgiveneſs, for it is impoſſible to expect from either ſide a criminal compliment. I have never yet deceived you; nor will I begin in this late period of life. If we are ſo unhappy to diſagree in opinion, I will not vote againſt you: but cannot vote for you.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE long been very ſenſible of the ſeveral improvements which the military ſpirit, ſo prevalent in theſe kingdoms, and the frequent incampments, have introduced into the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant counties. At preſent I ſhall forbear mentioning the happy effects they have had on the morals of the male part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and confine myſelf to that ſex to which we are indebted for every thing which renders life endurable. I was always its ſincere admirer; and am happy to find any occaſion of pointing out whatſoever may add to their charms, or extend their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
               <p>I WAS laſt ſummer in a gentleman's family in the inland part of <hi>England,</hi> with whom I had a long and intimate acquaintance. I happened to reach the place in the dog-days; and finding the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1233201500:104"/>ladies ſitting in an alcove in their cloth riding habits, inſtead of their cool chintzes, I expreſſed my fear that I prevented them from taking their morning ride. They aſſured me, they did not mean to ſtir out; and one of them, clapping on a vaſt hat with a cockade, declared ſhe would only go for her work, and ſit down for the reſt of the morning. On turning round, how was my ruſticity ſurprized to ſee her hair clubbed behind! ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave me an opportunity of ſeeing a whiſking queue; and a third a greaſy braid, hanging down and dabbing the ſhining cape!</p>
               <p>AFTER the morning was far ſpent, Miſs <hi>Dorothy</hi> (for, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the quality, there are now no ſuch things as <hi>Dollies, Mollies,</hi> and <hi>Betties</hi>) with a great yawn flung her arms over her head, and her legs a yard before her, and informed us, it was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time: then pulling her watch out of (I believe) a tight lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern breeches, acquainted us, that it was half paſt two; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it to its place with a moſt officer-like air.</p>
               <p>I SAW the countenance of my good old friend change. As ſoon as the ladies had left the place, he gave vent to his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the following terms: "My dear <hi>Jack,"</hi> ſays he, <q>what an alteration is there in the manners of this houſe ſince I laſt had the happineſs of your company! A curſed viſit to <hi>Coxheath</hi> hath infected my poor girls to a degree that gives me the keeneſt concern. The chaſte and elegant dreſs, which was once their characteriſtic, is now converted into what you have juſt ſeen. Female delicacy is changed into maſculine cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and as much of the garb aſſumed as at firſt view almoſt leaves the difference of ſex undiſtinguiſhable. The manly habit is put on with the morning, and, as you will ſee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, only changed for another of the ſame kind. The
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1233201500:105"/>watch too has alſo quitted its modeſt ſtation, and the fair wearer, inſtead of conſulting the hour with the former grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recline of the head, now boldly lugs out the oracle, and aſterwards thruſts it—the lord knows where! My niece <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> in defence of this new mode, ſays, that its motions are conſiderably altered ſince it had experienced a new ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No wonder, ſince it had quitted the temperate for the torrid zone. A long ſtring, with all the maſculine load of ſeals, &amp;c. now affectedly hangs down the center of the fair frame; ſometimes it is formed of hair, ending with a ſtrange fringe of the ſame. A celebrated antiquarian aſſured me that this was the true love-lock. And a wicked rogue added, that it was an excellent conductor of amorous ideas to our ſex, a remembrancer to our ſlack youth, and, like a ſtrange peculiarity in the dreſs of the ladies of <hi>Siam,</hi> which ſerves as a whet to the depraved appetites of their copper-coloured gallants. Inſtead of—</q> I could no longer bear his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo diverted the diſcourſe: but not without giving internal aſſent to part of his reflections, even tinctured as they were by the fooliſh prejudices of old age. Laudable as a due attention is to faſhion in young people, yet I was brought to confeſs that there were indecencies in thoſe of the preſent year, which are the diſguſt of the grave, the ſcoff of the licentious; are marks of a light mind, or bring under ſuſpicion of levity the pureſt heart, which thoughtleſsly adopts the unſuitable manners or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of our ſex.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I WAS the other day in a coffee-houſe filled with (not the firſt rate) company of this great town, where I long ſate indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at the topic which employed every tongue. I could have born with patience the common ſubjects of politics, the mere offspring of ignorance and rancour; but when I found their licentious mouths filled with the moſt infamous inferences, drawn from the unhappy conduct of a lady not leſs eminent for her rank than her beauty, I flung down my penny in a rage, and retired to my apartments full of reflections on ſome events unfortunately at this time too well known.</p>
               <p>THE love of fame in either ſex is a principle implanted in us for the moſt noble purpoſes, and is often of itſelf productive of the moſt important and generous effects. The character of the tender part of the creation confines them to a narrower ſphere of action: but their duties are not leſs conſequential than thoſe of our ſex, which make more eclat; and are attended with all the rewards that public merit can claim. If it is the lot of the fair to become wives and parents, a virtuous diſcharge of the duties of thoſe relations ſhould be the ſum of their ambition. But if
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1233201500:107"/>it be their fortune to remain ſingle, an equal fame will attend them by that delicacy and eaſe of behaviour towards the men, which form the genuine characteriſtics of virtue. If once this honeſt ſpecies of ambition forſakes them, and an anxiety after foreign admiration ſeizes them, they become the mark of every profligate wretch, or fluttering inſect; who may perhaps ſinge his wings, but at the ſame time is ſure to impair the brightneſs of the luminary. Every ſoft look, and every little levity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes encouragement; and the enduring of one free action is ſure to lay a foundation for another. The man of gallantry preſumes on appearances, miſtakes culpable vanity for vitious inclinations, and in the end, moſt deſervedly, ſuffers for his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: he is diſgracefully driven from the chateau by inſulting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics; or ſuffers ſtill more marked mortifications, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the inſulted fair. She diſtreſſes her poor huſband with her complaints: ſhe wonders at the fellow's impudence. Alas! what can the unhappy ſpouſe reply, but what muſt add to her and his own miſery? He may (but it is more likely his ſuſpicions may take an unhappy turn at the ſame time) he may, I ſay, allow her to be innocent at the bottom; but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her with having given the gallant every reaſon to expect an eaſy conqueſt: he may alſo unjuſtly conceive a jealouſy that there may have been, or that there ſtill may be, moments when poor virtue may be caught napping, and the ſum of female diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour effected. His peace of mind is gone; and mutual wretchedneſs becomes the price of the mere moments of levity, or the love of tranſient admiration.</p>
               <p>EVERY attempt for that purpoſe becomes criminal; ſince the concluſion is often as uncertain as it is unexpected. To call
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1233201500:108"/>aloud in public to men of gaiety; to ſuffer an unmeaning whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; or to retire to a remote ſeat; are acts which bring with them the cauſe of the moſt cruel ſcandal. In private company to force yourſelf at table almoſt on the lap of your favorite; to rivet your eye on his; to catch frequently at his hand, or every now and then to place your's on his knee; or mutually to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle your hands over the elbow chair, that they may come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived in contact, give as great diſguſt to the company as they do ſolid injury to the reputation of the fair offender, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe is married or whether ſhe is ſingle. If the object of attraction be a married man, how aggravated is the offence: how pitiable is the ſituation of the poor injured ſpouſe! And yet this ſpecies of conduct is very frequent, but never is paſſed unnoticed: the encouragement either brings unhappineſs on the thoughtleſs fair; or buſy ſcandal fixes on her an indelible blot: a cruel penalty! yet ſhe falls unpitied, as it is brought on her by a criminal or inſolent inattention to appearances.</p>

            <head type="sub">MISCELLANIES. FLINTSHIRE PETITION.</head>
            <p>THE clamors raiſed in the year 1779, and the apparent diſcontents grew to ſuch a height, that I thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the county of <hi>Flint</hi> ſhould add its weight to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, ſo that by prevaling on government to leſſen every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary burden, the minds of the people might be eaſed, and all ill conſequences prevented, for civil war was almoſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. I at all times profeſſed my abhorrence of committees and aſſociations. Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn</hi> adviſed me to write to ſome of our principal gentlemen to inform them of the terms on which I undertook to excite the county to petition, ſo that they might decline ſubſcribing to the requiſition, in caſe they diſliked my plan: or if they did ſign it, ſupport me to its full extent. None to whom I wrote appeared at the meeting. Mr. <hi>Yonge,</hi> one of the friends to whom I wrote, diſliked the petition, and declined ſigning the requiſition. Sir <hi>Stephen Glynn,</hi> bart. and <hi>Philip Lloyd Fletcher,</hi> eſq. approved my plan, and promiſed it every ſupport, and to adhere to the very letter of it. Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> alſo
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1233201500:110"/>ſent my letter along with the requiſition to the gentlemen of his neighborhood, that they might not miſtake the terms on which they were to ſign. I came to the meeting in a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on the faith of my countrymen: but the dean of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> burning after the glory of chairman of a committee, and backed by friends he brought with him, propoſed a committee, and carried his point.</p>
            <p>I DID intend to deliver the following ſpeech, but my ſpirits failed me.</p>
            <q rend="inline normQuotes">
               <p>BEING totally unuſed to ſpeak in public, I beg leave, in faultering words, to lay before you the motives which induced me to promote this meeting.</p>
               <p>THE diſtreſſes of the times are too evident to admit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. To have recourſe to any legal method of alleviating our ſufferings is extremely natural. The only one which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf is, 'by petition to the high court of parliament,' a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege preſerved to us by the BILL of RIGHTS, and which can never be exerted with more propriety than at preſent, provided reſpect and moderation attend it.</p>
               <p>IT is ſaid by an able ſpeaker on the ſide of oppoſition, 'that 300,000l. may be annually ſaved by retrenching the emoluments of offices, and aboliſhing the long train of uſeleſs placemen and penſioners.' As I make no doubt but this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman can ſupport his aſſertion, let me obſerve, that the above ſum will, at the rate of five per cent. pay the intereſt of more than ſix millions of money; and of courſe, in the next year, eaſe the all-ſupporting landlord and tenant from a burden equal to that ſum.</p>
               <p>THIS alone, in the neceſſitous ſtate of our country (which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1233201500:111"/>from the nature of its trade ſuffers more in proportion than others) ought to determine us to make uſe of the propoſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of relief, leaving it to the wiſdom of parlement ſeverely to ſcrutinize into the nature of our grievances, and to rectify every one which may be diſcovered to exiſt. It is juſt to enquire before we condemn. Let the accuſed, if guilty, ſuffer the penalty of their neglect; if innocent, acquitted with honor. But let the minds of the people be eaſed, by a proper enquiry into the foundation of the national diſcontent.</p>
               <p>THAT invaluable compilation the <hi>Red-book</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Edition 1779, pages 39, 122.</note> furniſhes me with a very ſingular inſtance of a place of little moment, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a high ſalary. I cannot but ſmile at ſeeing the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of one of our firſt cities, and one of the lords commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the admiralty, unite with that important charge the poſt of <hi>letter-carrier</hi> to the court, with the laviſh ſalary of 730l. a year. The duty might perhaps be performed (if any there is) by a leſs reſpectable perſon, for 2s. 6d. a day; and I will not pay a very worthy gentleman ſo bad a compliment, as to ſuppoſe, that his principles will be in the leſt altered by being free from ſuch a degrading office.</p>
               <p>MANY ſimilar inſtances may probably be found, all worthy of being lopped off: but let me do the times the juſtice to ſay, that few of them are of recent formation; they are the antient marks of regal ſtate, created in proſperous days. In the progreſs of enquiry, it will be worthy to remark the periods when they ceaſed to be ornaments to the crown, and became the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1233201500:112"/>THE affair of contracts is beyond my power to ſpeak to. It will be our wiſh that parlement would guard againſt the abuſe of them, and examine whether the princely ſtate in which our contractors live, ariſes from any thing beyond the fair profits of their buſineſs.</p>
               <p>IN attending to the report of any party on that ſubject, or any other, we ought to take particular care not to be too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. I ſay this becauſe of the alarm that has (I truſt cauſeleſsly) ariſen among <hi>us,</hi> of a deſign of altering the courts of juſtice in the principality in a manner grievous to the <hi>Welch:</hi> let us wait with patience till the honorable member has laid open his deſign; and if it is then found to be a grievance, let us reſiſt it with the ſame firmneſs as we did the treaſury warrant. I hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, not only in my own name, but in that of many reſpectable friends, great and ſmall freeholders, that we do not, by ſigning the petition before us, exclude ourſelves from ſeeking legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from any innovation, which may appear unjuſt and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, let it come from any quarter whatſoever.</p>
               <p>THE body of us petitioners conſiſts of a ſtupendous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of perſons, actuated with very different objects. I believe I may ſay with confidence, that there is not an individual in this aſſembly who has not the moſt laudable motives in view, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from every party ſpirit whatſoever.</p>
               <p>THERE are many very worthy and well-meaning gentlemen who think we have choſen an improper ſeaſon for petitioning, amidſt the rage of war. But let it be obſerved, that the ſtrength of government conſiſts in the variety of its reſources, and if we are able to point out a moſt important one, we rather accelerate than impede its motion. In the peaceable times to refuſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1233201500:113"/>would be a proper inſult to an obſtinate miniſter; but NOW! in the moment of RETURNING VICTORY <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Rodney</hi>'s defeat of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſleet, <hi>January</hi> 16th, 1780.</note>! it would be a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fraught with certain danger and poſſible parricide.</p>
               <p>I AM not of conſequence enough to trouble you with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, eſpecially as I have no other object than to add my mite to ſerve my country; I ſhall only detain you, while I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the ſteps I took after I had formed the reſolution of exciting the county to aſſemble on this occaſion. I drew up the requiſition to the ſheriff: I ſent it, accompanied with a letter, experſſive of my ſentiments, to the three worthy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men before mentioned. That I did not ſend it to more, was for want of time, not of reſpect. From my letter, and from the ſubſtance of a petition I ſent with it, they might judge of the utmoſt limits of my intentions, that in caſe they diſapproved of my deſign, they might decline ſubſcribing to my requiſition. It was returned to me, ſigned by an ample number, to whom I beg leave to return thanks for the compliment they were pleaſed to pay me.</p>
               <p>I objected in that letter, and I do now in the ſtrongeſt manner object, to all party-aſſociations, and for myſelf decline the honors of committee-man.</p>
               <p>THE former may end in combinations injurious to our peace, and perhaps fatal at the laſt to thoſe who embark in them. We MUST not ſend our repreſentative to the houſe with our prayer in one hand, and a dagger in the other. We MUST not attempt to intimidate the houſe from freedom of debate, at the time we are ſtriving to wreſt from men of power the peſtilential baits
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1233201500:114"/>of corruption: we MUST not wound when we wiſh to amend the diſeaſes of our conſtitution: we MUST be conſiſtent with ourſelves. The parlement will ſuffer a civil death in leſs than a twelvemonth; it will be the fault of the people if they chuſe another compoſed of members with whom they are at preſent ſo diſcontented. They will, when that period arrives, have an opportunity of legally rejecting thoſe candidates whom they diſapprove, and ſelecting thoſe only worthy of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            </q>
            <p>MY mention of petitioning with a dagger in one hand gave great offence; but I thought myſelf vindicated by the indecent language of ſome of the petitioners, of which the following is a ſpecimen.</p>
            <q>SUCH were the people who agreed to the petition on which I now lean. Oeconomy in the expenditure of the public money is all they aſk. Will any man vote for rejecting ſo modeſt, ſo reaſonable a requeſt? I hope not. Will any man vote that this petition be not brought up? No man, I truſt, will dare do it. The miniſter will not dare do it, becauſe he knows he ought not to dare it. But there is another thing alſo which he ought not to dare; and that is, to attempt to defeat the object of it. If the miniſter is ſo inclined, with the turn of his finger he may deſtroy it: but let him beware how he directs his influence againſt it. Let me adviſe him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how he inſtitutes an enquiry into the merits of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it ſpeaks for itſelf; and the petitioners will look upon ſuch an enquiry as a mockery, as a parlementary or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial trick to put an indirect negative upon their petition. When they met to draw it up they were unarmed; they had
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1233201500:115"/>neither muſkets nor ſtaves; but if you mock them, they will — I'll leave blanks for the ſagacity of the houſe to fill up.</q>
            <p>LORD <hi>Ongly</hi> reprobated the idea of threats, notwithſtanding he was a petitioner, and voted in this inſtance with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority.</p>
            <q>LORD <hi>Ongly</hi> reprobated, in ſevere terms, the connection that ſubſiſted between the petition and county aſſociations. Threats had been hinted, and more than hinted, if the prayer of this and of other ſimilar petitions ſhould be rejected. This alone, in his lordſhip's opinion, was ſufficient to damn the petition. It puts me in mind, ſaid he, of the man who went about robbing, under pretence of ſelling rabbits. He held out the rabbits in one hand, and a piſtol in the other, and very civilly aſked thoſe he chanced to meet, whether they choſe to buy any rabbits. Such is the conduct of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in the different counties; a conduct, which, if it is not checked in the bud, may be productive of the moſt fatal conſequences to the liberty and happineſs of this country.</q>
            <p>THE clamor continued. I was attacked in the papers, and I put an end to the war by the following anſwer.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM much obliged to you for your favor of the 5th inſtant. I pay ſuch deference to your opinion, that I entirely lay aſide all thoughts of troubling your honorable houſe with the affair of repealing the act of exemption of mail-coaches from the payment of tolls. I would avoid every adventure which does not promiſe ſucceſs, and ſhould be much mortified to be unhorſed and laid ſprawling on the <hi>arena</hi> of <hi>St. Stephen</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>YET I ſhall be extremely ſorry that any member of your houſe ſhould, through any quickneſs of miſapprehenſion, wilful or natural, imagine me to be ſo wild as to think of an attempt that was not founded on reaſonable and honeſt principles.</p>
               <p>I AM ſenſible that the exemption of the mails from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tolls commenced very early: I think, firſt by an act of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> which was afterwards repeated in ſeveral others, till it was oppreſſively confirmed by that of the 25th <hi>Geo.</hi> III.</p>
               <p>THE moſt ſecond-ſighted of your houſe could never have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen that the uſage of the ſingle horſe and poſt-boy, afterwards in many parts converted into the light mail-cart drawn by one horſe, would be ſuperſeded by a <hi>royal</hi> carriage drawn by four horſes, and filled by paſſengers, who before rode in the common ſtages, and contributed to ſupport the roads which they paſſed over. This unfortunate change proceeded
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1233201500:119"/>from an extent of prerogative, repined at only when perverted to the injury of the ſubject; as this moſt inconteſtably muſt be allowed to have done.</p>
               <p>UNDER the ſanction of the firſt act, turnpike gates were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and immenſe ſums of money lent on the national faith. For a long time the ſecurity was eſteemed good; and in <hi>Wales,</hi> where five per cent. was given, people at firſt were happy to place their money on mortgages they imagined ſo ſafe. The transfer was then eaſy, and the public reſted perfectly content. The commiſſioners did their duty fully: they laid out the money to the beſt advantage; nor did they deſiſt till the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tolls, by the fatal change of the mode of conveyance, had taken place.</p>
               <p>I WILL exemplify the hardſhips only in the country I live. Other places equally remote from the capital muſt come in for their ſhare of the grievance: but they will fall under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſcription.</p>
               <p>BEFORE the inſtitution of mail-coaches, two ſtage-coaches ran through the county of <hi>Flint.</hi> And, were it not for an evaſion, the change of horſes between gate and gate in the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, one of the diſtricts principally aggrieved, each would have paid forty pounds a year. This unhappily was left unguarded in the act. By the help of that evaſion both together only paid that ſum: and even that ſum, had we not been deprived of it, would have enabled us to take up 800l. more; and given us the power of repairing every part of the road which was not unexceptionably good.</p>
               <p>MANY parts may have been allowed to have been indifferent; but they were adequate to the uſes of the country, not only for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1233201500:120"/>the uſe of the farmers and the carriers, but alſo for the luxury of carriages.</p>
               <p>IN this ſtate they were found at the introduction of mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaches. Theſe ſoon occaſioned the ſuppreſſion of the common ſtages, and deprived us at once of forty pounds of annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. In the year 1789, a perſon was ſent from the general poſt-office to ſurvey the roads. From his report, and by the orders of the poſt-office, indictments were preferred at the great ſeſſions at <hi>Mold,</hi> againſt the whole extent of road in the narrow but long county of <hi>Flint.</hi> In ſome inſtances, I fear the grand jury made a ſtrain of their conſciences in finding the bills; for ſome of the indicted places were in moſt admirable repair. But we were unwilling to obſtruct any thing that tended to promote the public good.</p>
               <p>FINES to the amount of 1200 l. were impoſed on the ſeveral townſhips, many of which were very ſmall, and the inhabitants compoſed of ſmall farmers, and laborers, poor and diſtreſſed to the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>Two of theſe townſhips had a great extent of road, and only a few labourers, and a few miſerable teams, to perform their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute duty. One of theſe townſhips, terrified with the proſpect of ruin, by the execution of the <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> performed twenty-two days duty upon the road. The other townſhip had only a ſingle farmer living in it, who performed a duty of twenty-eight days.</p>
               <p>THE vaſt expences which the commiſſioners had been at in the repairs of the roads, had almoſt exhauſted the credit, in ſome totally; ſo that at preſent 50 l. cannot be obtained for 400l. worth of our parchment ſecurities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1233201500:121"/>AT this period I was moved with compaſſion at the complaint and diſtreſſes of the poor. This induced me to write my circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar letter to the ſeveral grand juries of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> in order to induce them to unite in a common cauſe. I bluſh at my want of ſucceſs, reſulting from either ignorance of, or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to, the firſt principles of ſecurity of property. I was ſimple enough to think that the juſtice of the cauſe would have inſured an approbation of my plan. Inſtead of that, I am told, that in ſome places it was even treated with rudeneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I ventured even to write to two gentlemen with whom I was not perſonally acquainted: they never paid the leſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my letter: they forgot my character, and they forgot their own.</p>
               <p>I TOOK the liberty of getting my circular letter conveyed to a third gentleman high in office, with whom I was acquainted. It was returned with (written on a corner of it) "Mr. <hi>Pennant</hi> is in the wrong, and I will have no concern in the affair." The gentleman may be politically right; but I am confident that Mr. <hi>Pennant</hi> is not morally wrong.</p>
               <p>THERE has certainly been a ſtrong miſapprehenſion of my meaning. I did not intend the abolition of mail-coaches: they have their objections; whether we conſider the barbarity with which the poor horſes are treated, or the very frequent deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſſengers—our old <hi>Jehus</hi> may have ſlain their thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; our modern, their tens of thouſands. I only wiſhed that they might not prove oppreſſive to many of our counties, by cauſes I have before mentioned. True it is, that, in my firſt circular letter, I did moſt raſhly and unadviſedly hint, that they might, without injury, be converted into the mail-cart.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1233201500:122"/>The gentlemen of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> who, I muſt confeſs, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſomething ſhould be done for us, very juſtly fired on the idea of ſending their <hi>Theſpis</hi> again into his cart. A worthy friend of mine of that county warmly but kindly expoſtulated with me on the ſubject: but I hope this my declaration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will be admitted, and atone for my error.</p>
               <p>THE grand juries of <hi>Cheſhire, Berkſhire, Monmouthſhire,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>North Wales,</hi> united in the ſupport of my deſign. The reſt of the counties proved to me the truth of the remark of <hi>Swift,</hi>
                  <q>That he never knew any perſon who did not bear the misfortunes of another perfectly like a Chriſtian!</q>
               </p>
               <p>FAR the majority of the roads in <hi>England</hi> have great revenues, ariſing from the multitude of ſtage-coaches that keep their ground in defiance of mails. Our ſtages the obliged to deſiſt from travelling, and give the former a moſt unjuſt and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive monopoly. The counties intereſted in them feel not our unhappineſs, and want generoſity to contribute to the allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſtreſſes we ſuffer.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould have made a claim on the juſtice of the houſe, had we had the moſt diſtant proſpect of ſucceſs. We are now in the caſe of creditors defrauded by the ſuperior cunning of an artful debtor. Had an individual received an adequate mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage on his eſtate, and had afterwards the dexterity to leſſen the income, what name would he have deſerved? The higheſt term of reproach; but ſuch a one that could never be applied the moſt remotely to any member of your honorable houſe.</p>
               <p>THIS affair has never yet been ſeriouſly conſidered. Good men, I truſt, will now awake as from a ſleep; and ſtand amazed and confuſed at the ſad deluſion they diſcovered that they had labored under. Favourite ſyſtems run away with mankind,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1233201500:123"/>and totally annihilate all attention to the inconveniences they occaſion. The act was obtained late in the ſeſſions, hurried through a very thin houſe, and with the ſlighteſt oppoſition. The legiſlature obliges a certain time of notice to be given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the introduction of a common turnpike bill. Let me aſk. Should not at leſt the interval of a ſeſſion have been given for the diſcuſſion of ſo ſtrange and unequal a taxation?</p>
               <p>WHAT, may I aſk, could make the individual liable to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and the actions of the collective body be paſſed over without blame? Either the numbers defend, or ſome daemon, like the ghoſtly father of <hi>Charles</hi> I. has whiſpered in your ears, Have a double conſcience! one that is to make you conſult the plain dictates of honeſty: the other telling you to ſupport ſome fancied public good, at the expence of a certain number of perſons, who, in times not very remote, had truſted their money to the ſecurity of the public faith.</p>
               <p>OR may you not hold the ſame doctrine as the nuns in <hi>Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram Shandy;</hi> that the diviſibility of ſin may enable you to fritter it away into almoſt nothing?—You certainly have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, The nuns were but two, you are five hundred and fifty-two to bear the feather-weight of the wrong deciſion, you had moſt unwarily been induced to make.</p>
               <p>LET me now aſk, Are there no inſtances of repeal of acts on far leſs important occaſions? I well recollect two. The firſt is the <hi>Jew Act,</hi> which had in fact no conſequences to be feared, religious or political. The other was the cyder tax, eſteemed like ours a partial grievance; and yet its overthrow was eaſily effected. I reflect on theſe two acts repeated without cauſe, and on our oppreſſions continued in defiance of every principle of juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1233201500:124"/>SINCE your honorable houſe was determined to weaken our ſecurities, ought it not to have firſt paid off every turnpike mortgage? and then you might have had full liberty of doing what you pleaſed with the income of the gates.</p>
               <p>I BEG leave to lay before you a caſe in which your houſe once ſhewed a moſt ſcrupulous attention to the rights of creditors. That was by the repeal of a clauſe in the <hi>Kingſland</hi> turnpike act. Part of it leads from <hi>Shoreditch</hi> to <hi>Ware,</hi> and this part was croſſed by the <hi>Newmarket</hi> road, and tolls were taken by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the <hi>Ware</hi> road, from all travellers to and from that ſeminary of virtue, merely for croſſing the road. On the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the <hi>Kingſland</hi> turnpike act, the <hi>Newmarket</hi> people inſiſted that they ſhould paſs free of tolls. A clauſe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the new act for that purpoſe, and the croſs-gates were pulled down. The creditors of the <hi>Kingſland</hi> turnpike peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the houſe of commons for redreſs; they ſucceeded, and the croſs-gates were again erected, and the tolls taken till the whole of the creditors were paid.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1233201500:125"/>I IMAGINE that there is not a member of the houſe who has not acted as a commiſſioner of the turnpikes. Let me requeſt him to call to mind, whether he has not in that character, or in the character of a magiſtrate, treated with a harſh ſeverity the delinquent who, through poverty, has defrauded the gate of nine-pence. What pleas of conſcience have not the commiſſioners urged for maintaining the intereſts of the gates, and diſcharging their truſt like men of honor? Is there not a <hi>Lethean</hi> atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere in the chapel of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> ſo ſuddenly to efface all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of tranſactions in the common air of the world? I truſt that there is: otherwiſe the individual who, in one place and in one character, had been ſo ſtrenuous to ſave a poor nine-pence, ſhould in another place, and in another character, vote as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the comptroller-general of the poſt-office, an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mails from toll, a ſum amounting to not leſs than 90,000l. a year, on which he has a moſt conſiderable poundage, beſides ſome very good pickings from other articles. This I am aſſured of by a worthy member of your houſe. I think his ſalary is but 1500l. per ann. What a monſtrous quantity of ſack is allowed to his halfpennyworth of bread!</p>
               <p>So liberally ſupplied as the comptroller has been with the means, cannot ſomething be deducted to relieve our complaint? If the honorable houſe does not chooſe this mode, a ſmall, a very ſmall tax on the paſſengers, and on the immenſe ſums got by the carriage of parcels, would compenſate for the loſs of exemption of tolls. The rich <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſtricts would be above taking advantage of this diminution of revenue to the comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller-general. It is only for the poor <hi>Welch</hi> diſtricts, and a few others like circumſtanced, for which it is humbly aſked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1233201500:126"/>I HAVE a reſpect for the plan of the mail-coaches, and for the inventor; but I never could think of applying to him as the <hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zam al muluc,</hi> the regulator of the poſting-empire. There ought not to be in our conſtitution ſuch a monſter as a comptroller un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable by his legiſlature, or his ſuperiors in office: legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt now ſee its imprudence in permitting a latitude of ſo dangerous a nature. I, an individual, never could bear the thought: I looked for redreſs to the poſt-maſter general, or to the three eſtates of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>I FEAR too great a veneration has been paid to this new-created office, and mode of conveying the mail. I always wiſh to pay every individual and every office a due reſpect; but in this caſe I muſt preſerve the independent and uſeful man, and endeavour to correct every abuſe that falls within my ſphere as a provincial magiſtrate. What I am going to ſay may be deemed foreign to a legiſlative friend; yet as it may prove uſeful to many who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe new vehicles with a kind of veneration, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an affair which happened in our county in the laſt autumn. Let me premiſe, that thoſe protectors of the mail, the guards, relying on the name of royalty, had in the courſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> road through <hi>North Wales,</hi> committed great exceſſes. One, on a trifling quarrel, ſhot dead a poor old gate-keeper: a coroner's jury was huddled up; and, in defiance of the tears of the widow, no judicial notice has been taken of the affair to this very day. In <hi>Angleſey,</hi> another of theſe guards diſcharged his piſtol wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly in the face of a chaiſe horſe, drawing his maſter, the Rev. <hi>John Bulkely,</hi> who was flung out, and died either on the ſpot or ſoon aſter. Theſe guards ſhoot at dogs, hogs, ſheep and poultry,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1233201500:127"/>as they paſs the road, and even in towns, to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants. I determined to put a ſtop to theſe exceſſes, and ſoon had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>A NEIGHBORING gate-keeper laid before me a complaint, that one of the guards had threatened to blow his brains out; and had actually ſhot a dog that had offended him by his barking. I iſſued out my warrant, had the guard ſeized, and brought before me. He was a man who, for his great beauty and elegant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was called the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> I did not heſitate to play the Judge <hi>Gaſcoigne;</hi> but from the goodneſs of his appearance, and the propriety of his behaviour, I did not go quite the length that famous magiſtrate did. I took bail for his appearance at our quarter ſeſſions. He appeared before us, when, by the permiſſion of the chairman, I took the lead in ſpeaking. I repreſented to the audience, that the guards were intruſted with arms merely for the protection of the mail and the paſſengers, not for the terror of his Majeſty's ſubjects; that a mail-coach was no ſanctuary; that the bailiff might drag the debtor out of it; the conſtable, the felon; the exciſeman might rummage it for contraband goods, and that with as little ceremony as if it had been a higler's cart. I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, had the driver been the offender, as the guard was, he ſhould have been taken into cuſtody, and the poſt-maſter of the diſtrict left to provide another to convey the mail to the next ſtage. The behaviour of the delinquent was ſo becoming his ſituation, that by the leave of the court I diſmiſſed the offender with ſuch a reprimand as became the high ſtation of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> juſtice of the peace: an office in dignity and conſtitutional utility inferior to none in the land. Young men of the age, early initiate yourſelves into that great character!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1233201500:128"/>I BEG pardon for detaining you ſo long, but ſo much I thought was due to myſelf and to the public. A few papers I have ſubjoined will fling ſome farther light on the ſubject, as well as on my proceedings from the beginning. I remain, with much regard,</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM much indebted to you for your late favor, with an official letter incloſed. I have no kind of doubt but that the comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller general will, on cool re-conſideration of his deſign of altering the courſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> mail, be induced to lay it totally aſide. He will admit the importance of the county of <hi>Cheſter</hi> in its ancient ſtaple of the cheeſe, on which our fleets and armies ſo greatly depend. The city itſelf (if I may judge by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent advertiſements) is about to enter deeply on the fuſtian manufacture. The great remittances of taxes from the county, and from great part of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and the remittances to and from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thoſe occaſioned by the great biennial linen fairs, muſt be flung into the ſcale.</p>
               <p>THE port of <hi>Park-Gate</hi> has of late years riſen into much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. It at preſent maintains four ſtout pacquets, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly ply between that port and <hi>Dublin.</hi> The correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of the numbers of paſſengers embarking or diſembark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the great remittances through this channel, are of no ſmall moment, and of great general concern.</p>
               <p>THE county of <hi>Flint</hi> (little as it is of itſelf), thanks to you and other companies, ſettling among us, is now riſing into an amazing ſtate of opulence: few perhaps can rival it. Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1233201500:130"/>cient lead trade was always conſiderable; but by the introduction of the copper and cotton buſineſs, <hi>Holywell,</hi> its environs, and their dependencies, may boaſt of commercial property, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the amount of a million ſterling.</p>
               <p>I HAVE always conſidered Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi>'s plan as uſeful to his country, and an honor to himſelf, except in one article. I can never ſuppoſe that he will perſiſt in deviating from the utility of his ſcheme, by diverting the mail from ſuch a country as I have deſcribed. <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> has already its mail; after <hi>Oſweſtry</hi> is paſt, the greateſt part of the road to <hi>Conwy</hi> is mountainous, poor, and half depopulated.</p>
               <p>IT gives me concern to find our intereſts claſh with thoſe of the county of <hi>Salop.</hi> I muſt allow the excellency of the great ſtaples of its capital, brawn and rich cakes; but ſtill we have the balance in our favor; for on the moſt exact and impartial calculation, I do not find that at preſent the annual conſumption (of both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) can poſſibly exceed the ſum of 152,341l. 16s. 9¾d.</p>
               <p>THE exceptionable article I allude to is the exemption of the mail-coaches from tolls. This falls heavy on the leſſer diſtricts: poſſibly we might have endured even that, had we not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with indictments, and compelled to repairs beyond the real wants of the country. That is now over; we only wiſh the reſtoration of our loſt tolls, to enable us to ſupport the roads in the preſent ſtate, and to take away all future grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint from every quarter. This will induce me to perſiſt in my deſign of applying to parlement for redreſs of the grievance that affects the gates from <hi>Cheſter</hi> to <hi>Conwy,</hi> let the rich <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſtricts take what ſhare they pleaſe in their own concerns. There is one difficulty in <hi>Flintſhire</hi> in reſpect to the road itſelf—I mean
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1233201500:131"/>
                  <hi>Rhiallt Hill;</hi> the alteration is beyond the power of the poor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it lies in, and beyond the power of the poor <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſtrict to effect. Poſſibly the improvement may coſt from 300l. to 400l. a ſum adequate to the eſtimate has been raiſed by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubſcription of the neighboring gentlemen: and the placo moſtly complained of, has been moſt nobly improved, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of 221l. 18s. 3d. I wiſh a ſmall ſum might be got from parlement, for that and the relief of a few other poor townſhips. I cannot bear to drive over roads ſmoothed by the bread of the poor peaſantry. If the mail will be permanent, I will cheerfully ſubſcribe fifty guineas towards that improvement. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with ſaying, that a ſmall addition to the fare of paſſengers between <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Conwy,</hi> will indemnify the coach from the loſs by toll. Let Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> who cannot but be fertile in expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, conſider of the matter. My earneſt wiſh is to have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony reſtored, and the ſtrongeſt mutual efforts made for the general good.</p>

               <p>ON <hi>Thurſday</hi> two letters were laid by Mr. <hi>Smalley</hi> before the commiſſioners of the <hi>Flint, Holywell,</hi> and <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſtricts, ſigned <hi>D. Smith,</hi> and <hi>G. Boulton;</hi> in which our attention was requeſted to the repair of the roads which lay in our county in the courſe of the mail. It falls to my lot to deſire you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to your reſpectable corporation, what the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have done, and what they intend to do of their own proper motions, not from the fear of any of the very unbecoming me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces ſent forth.</p>
               <p>ON the road from <hi>Holywell</hi> to the extremity of the diſtrict (which is called the <hi>Flint),</hi> has been laid out, within two years, 953l. in the ſpace of five miles: great part of which, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the indictments, was in moſt admirable repair.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſtrict begins at the weſtern end of the <hi>Flint:</hi> much of it is in very good order: part is very indifferent, owing to the impoveriſhed ſtate of the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſtrict, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of the poor inhabitants of the townſhip in which <hi>Rhiallt-hill</hi> lies, to repair that part, which is bad by nature. I propoſe a ſubſcription: you ſee my offer in the incloſed. We look up to the city of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as both are engaged in a common cauſe.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Holywell</hi> diſtrict is, excepting near <hi>Halkin,</hi> in excellent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1233201500:133"/>repair. The part complained of will be attended to at the next meeting at <hi>Holywell,</hi> at eleven o'clock on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 8th of <hi>February.</hi> We ſhall be happy to ſee any gentlemen on the part of your city.</p>
               <p>EXCUSE me if I remind the city of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the county, and alſo the county of <hi>Flint,</hi> that our importance is ſuch, that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a mail is a matter of right; not a petition for favor. How ſuperior is the juſtice of our claim to that of <hi>Salop,</hi> which had long ſince its independent mail!</p>
               <p>IN reſpect to my particular actings, I never will perſiſt in any thing that is wrong; nor deſiſt from any thing that is right. Our clame for aboliſhing the exemption from tolls is founded on common honeſty. My ſeizing on the guard was the act of an attentive magiſtrate, to prevent future murders. Two, if not three, had been committed: one near <hi>Conwy;</hi> another in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſey:</hi> beſides the terror ſpread along the whole road by the wanton conduct of the profligate guards. I brought the affair before our quarter-ſeſſion; more to ſet it in the true light than to puniſh the offender. I was aſperſed in your city; but the examination wiped away the dirty paragraph.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I REQUEST you to lay before the public the following advertiſement, addreſſed by the commiſſioners of the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> turnpike diſtrict, in order to avert in future the hardſhips ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the townſhips of the county of <hi>Flint</hi> labor under in the repairs of the roads. The advertiſement itſelf relates to the greater part of the grievances. It was ſent to the paper too late to inform the <hi>Engliſh</hi> circuits, but has been approved by the grand juries of <hi>Cheſhire, Denbighſhire,</hi> and <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> at the Spring aſſizes, and by that of <hi>Berkſhire</hi> and <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> being the Autumn aſſizes. Let me here inform you, that, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments from the General Poſt-Office, fines to the amount of 1200l. have been laid on the ſeveral townſhips lying in the courſe of the poſt-roads in the little county of <hi>Flint,</hi> many of which are very ſmall, and labour under the greateſt poverty. One in particular has a vaſt extent of road to repair, and only a few labourers, and four miſerable teams to perform their ſtatute labor. Under thoſe circumſtances, terrified with the proſpect of ruin, they performed twenty-two days ſtatute duty. The French <hi>corvées,</hi> now ſo reaſonably aboliſhed, were introduced on Britiſh ground, yet in vain; for a fine of 82l. 10s. was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the poor people. So little intereſted were they, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1233201500:135"/>numbers of others of the <hi>Welſh</hi> townſhips, in the paſſage of the mail-coach, that poſſibly they do not receive a letter in a year; yet theſe townſhips muſt ſuffer equally with the moſt opulent and commercial towns. Many of the roads were unexceptionably repaired; the reſt were in ſufficient repair for the uſes of the farmer, for the uſes of the gentlemen's carriages, and for the uſes of the mail, before the late unguarded innovations. We are, like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> required to make brick without ſtraw. The means of repair are taken from us, and we are fined for not performing impoſſibilities. A poſt-road is a national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; that to a neighboring kingdom doubly ſo: and certainly that conſideration ſhould induce legiſlature to afford an aid in ſuch caſes in which it is found neceſſary; and if a road muſt be finiſhed with finical perfection, the expence ought never to fall on thoſe who are totally unintereſted in it. Juſtice can never require that the poor ſhould keep pace with the innovations made for the benefit of commerce or luxury. Much of the road-laws calls loudly for a reform: in all laws there ſhould be a point of limitation. The attention of the grand juries is requeſted at the enſuing aſſizes. It is hoped that they will direct their repreſentatives to make the mail-coaches liable to tolls. We mean no injury to Mr. <hi>Palmer:</hi> let him, before the meeting of parlement, ſuggeſt any remedy for the evil, and we ſhall reſt content. They will certainly do away the great parlementary opprobrium of the act paſſed by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; which leſſens a ſecurity granted on the faith of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement. And much more may be ſaid on this ſubject; but the detail is reſerved for another occaſion; you may be again
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1233201500:136"/>troubled with my complaints, as well as ſome account of a townſhip grievance, brought on it by thoſe whoſe peculiar office it was to have guarded againſt the deceptions which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on their judgment, and brought on a moſt erroneous and diſgraceful adjudication.</p>

                              <p n="1">1. AT a meeting of the truſtees of the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> turnpike, held at the houſe of <hi>Joſeph Roberts,</hi> at the <hi>Blue Bell,</hi> on <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 30, 1791, the ſtate of the roads was taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration:</p>
                              <p n="2">2. WHEN it appeared, that parts of the coal-road were greatly out of repair; the trade in which was the original foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this turnpike.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. THAT the preſent annual tolls are very inadequate to remedy the evil.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. THAT the failure of the tolls does not ariſe from any decay of trade in the country, but from the exemption granted by parliament, by the 25th <hi>Geo.</hi> III. c. 57, to the mail-coaches from the payment of any tolls.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. THAT, by ſuch exemption, the common ſtage-coaches have been obliged to deſiſt from travelling, by reaſon of the burthen they are ſingly to ſuſtain, and which the mail-coaches are freed from, and now in many places monopolize the buſineſs.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. THAT the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſtrict alone ſuffers a loſs of 40l. a year, which is the intereſt of 800l. the loſs of which prevents the truſtees from the repairing of road equal to the expenditure of ſuch a ſum.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. THAT the clauſe of exemption in favor of the mail-coaches
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1233201500:138"/>is highly detrimental to the credit of the tolls, and the fecurity of the lenders, who had lent their money under the pledge of parliamentary faith.</p>
                              <p n="8">8. ORDERED, That the expediency of petitioning parliament on this ſubject be farther taken into conſideration, and that theſe reſolutions be publiſhed in the next <hi>Cheſter</hi> paper, as they are public concerns; every poſt-road, and its ſeveral creditors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſted therein.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. THAT the ſum of ten guineas be paid into the hands of the ſolicitor, towards the expences of the propoſed bill, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing the exemption of tolls of the mail-coaches, and for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them to tolls, in caſe ſuch bill be brought into parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and that the commiſſioners of the ſeveral turnpike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts in <hi>Great Britain</hi> be invited to correſpond, by their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, on the ſubject, with <hi>Samuel Small,</hi> treaſurer of the <hi>Flint</hi> and <hi>Holywell</hi> diſtricts, and <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> aſſiſtant treaſurer of that of <hi>Moſtyn.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="10">10. THAT the thanks of the commiſſioners be given to the foremen and grand juries of the counties of <hi>Cheſhire, Denbigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> for their liberal concurrence with the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the commiſſioners of the <hi>Moſtyn</hi> diſtrict.</p>
                              <p n="11">11. THAT it is requeſted of the gentlemen of this county to attend at <hi>Mold,</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> to give a ſanction to this propoſal, and to prepare one or more petitions, or to give neceſſary inſtruction to the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the county and borough, &amp;c. as may then be thought proper.</p>
                              <p n="12">12. AND, in order to give force to this reaſonable clame
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1233201500:139"/>on parliament, it is recommended to the gentlemen of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring counties, who may attend the duty of their country on the enſuing grand juries, to take the above into conſideration, and add their weight to the common cauſe.</p>

               <p>IN THE COUNTY OF FLINT, Held at the <hi>Antelope,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Holywell,</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 20th day of <hi>December,</hi> 1792;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved unanimouſly,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT it is the opinion of this meeting, that aſſociations of all perſons enjoying the unexampled benefits of the happy and envied conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> are at this time highly expedient and neceſſary, to aſſiſt in preſerving the eſtabliſhed liberties and growing proſperity of our country.</p>
               <p>We do therefore aſſociate ourſelves;—and do profeſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our unalienable attachment to the Conſtitution, our firm and inviolable allegiance to our gracious Sovereign, under whoſe mild and beneficent reign we poſſeſs all the advantages of good
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1233201500:143"/>government; our obedience to the laws, and our anxious wiſhes for peace and good order in ſociety, which it is our determined reſolution to uſe all our exertions to preſerve; and we do expreſs our abhorrence of every attempt made to deprive us of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable bleſſings we now enjoy.</p>
               <p>Thus aſſociated, we feel it our duty to point out, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt all orders of men in this country to reflect on, the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefits of our excellent conſtitution.</p>
               <p>We are governed by known laws, that are juſt and equal, and reſpect not perſons; they alike reſtrain oppreſſion and curb licentiouſneſs: <hi>The higheſt</hi> (as hath been well obſerved) <hi>are within their reach, and the loweſt have their full protection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the arts, farming, manufactures, trade, and every employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and labour of man, are encouraged, and flouriſh beyond any thing known in any former period, or in any country; every man poſſeſſes in ſecurity the fruit of his labour. Talents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry are ſure of ſucceſs, and may, as we daily ſee, riſe to wealth and honor.</p>
               <p>We enjoy, and have long enjoyed, the perfection of civil liberty in our perſons, our property, and our honeſt opinions: and it is the glory of <hi>Britain,</hi> that of all the nations of <hi>Europe—HERE ONLY ALL MEN ARE FREE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is then our duty, and we ſolemnly pledge ourſelves, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and individually, to uſe our utmoſt endeavors to preſerve theſe invaluable bleſſings, by a firm and zealous attachment to our King and Conſtitution, a ready and ſtrenuous ſupport of the magiſtracy, and the moſt active and unremitted vigilance to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and prevent all tumult, diſorder, and ſeditious meetings and publications.</p>
