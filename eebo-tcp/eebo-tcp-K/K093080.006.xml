            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <byline>BY DR. AKENSIDE<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Mark Akenſide was born on the 9th of November, 1721, at Newcaſtle upon Tyne. His father Mark was a butcher of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Sect. He received the firſt part of his education at the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſchool of Newcaſtle, and was afterwards inſtructed by Mr. Wilſon, who kept a private academy. Being intended for the office of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting miniſter, he was ſent at the age of eighteen years to Edinburgh; but, altering his firſt deſign, he turned his application to the ſtudy of phyſick, which he afterwards continued at Leyden, where he took his degree of Doctor on the 16th of May, 1744. He firſt practiſed in his profeſſion at Northampton, from whence he removed to Hampſtead, and afterwards to London. He was choſen Fellow of the Royal Society; became a phyſician to St. Thomas's Hoſpital; was admitted by manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus to the degree of Doctor of Phyſic in the univerſity of Cambridge; and was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Phyſicians in London. Upon the Settlement of the Queen's houſehold he was appointed one of the phyſicians to her Majeſty. He died of a putrid fever June 23, 1770, and was buried at the church of St. James's, Weſtminſter.</note>. MDCCXLVI.</byline>

                  <p>The Nymphs who preſide over ſprings and rivulets are addreſſed at day-break in honour of their ſeveral functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the firſt allegorical dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of the Gods and the riſe of things. They are then ſucceſſively conſidered, as giving motion to the air and exciting ſummer-breezes; as nouriſhing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulneſs of navigable rivers, and conſequently to the main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenance of commerce, and by that means to the maritime part of military power. Next is repreſented their favourable influence upon health, when aſſiſted by rural exerciſe; which introduces their connection with the art of phyſic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal ſprings. Laſtly, they are celebrated for the friendſhip which the Muſes bear them, and for the true inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which temperance only can receive; in oppoſition to the enthuſiaſm of the more licentious poets.</p>

                           <hi>Elder than Chaos.</hi>] Heſiod, in his Theogony, gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldeſt of beings; though he aſſigns to Love neither father nor ſuperior; which circumſtance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus, in Plato's Banquet, as being obſervable not only in Heſiod, but in all other writers both in verſe and proſe: and on the ſame occaſion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is expreſsly ſtyled the eldeſt of all the gods. Yet Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, in The Birds, affirms, that <q>Chaos, and Night, and Erebus, and Tartarus, were firſt; and that Love was produced from an egg, which the ſable-winged night depoſited in the immenſe boſom of Erebus.</q> But it muſt be obſerved, that the Love deſigned by this comic poet was always diſtinguiſhed from the other, from that original and ſelf-exiſtent being the <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> or ſecond perſon of the old Grecian trinity; to whom is inſcribed an hymn among thoſe which paſs under the name of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the firſt-begotten, is ſaid to have been born of an egg, and is repreſented as the principal or origin of all theſe external appearances of nature. In the fragments of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus, collected by Henry Stephens, he is named Phanes, the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or diſcloſer; who unfolded the ideas of the ſupreme intelligence, and expoſed them to the perception of inferior beings in this viſible frame of the world; as Macrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the ſeveral paſſages of Orpheus, which they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                        <p>But the Love deſigned in our text is the one ſelf-exiſtent and infinite mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologiſts have not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or truly deſcribed in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances; yet, to a modern poet, it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular; though, in other reſpects, he profeſſeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions. For, in theſe great points of natural theology, they differ no leſs remarkably among themſelves; and are perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the philoſophical relations of things with the traditionary circumſtances of mythic hiſtory; upon which very account, Calſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, in his Hymn to Jupiter, declareth his diſſent from them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even an article of the national creed; adding, that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautic poem, aſcribed to Orpheus, it is ſaid, that <q>Love, whom mortals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eternally begotten Night;</q> who is generally repreſented, by theſe mythological poets, as being herſelf the parent of all things; and who, in the Indigitamenta, or Orphic Hymns, is ſaid to be the ſame with Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris, or Love itſelf. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautic poem, where the perſonated Orpheus introduceth himſelf ſinging to his lyre in reply to Chiron, he celebrateth <q>the obſcure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itſelf in a ſtate of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual viciſſitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined; the generation of the earth; the depth of the ocean; and alſo the ſapient Love, the moſt ancient, the ſelf-ſufficient; with all the beings which he produced when he ſeparated one thing from another</q> Which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſage is more directly to Ariſtotle's purpoſe in the firſt book of his metaphyſics than any of thoſe which he has there quoted, to ſhew that the ancient poets and mythologiſts agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras and the other more ſober philoſophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the neceſſity of mind and reaſon to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For, though neither this poem, nor the hymns which paſs under the ſame name, are, it ſhould ſeem, the work of the real Orpheus; yet beyond all queſtion they are very ancient. The hymns, more particularly, are allowed to be older than the invaſion of Greece by Xerxes; and were probably a felt of public and ſolemn forms of devotion; as appears by a paſſage in one of them, which Demoſthenes hath almoſt literally cited in his firſt oration againſt Ariſtogiton, as the ſaying of Orpheus, the founder of their moſt holy myſteries. On this account, they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant, the Theogony of Heſiod himſelf not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble; and the myſterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impreſſion upon the mind, cannot be better expreſſed than in that remarkable deſcription with which they inſpired the German edition Eſchenbach, when he accidentally met with them at Leipſic: "Theſaurum me reperiſſe credidi," ſays he, <q>&amp; proſecto theſaurum reperi. Incredibile dictu quo me ſacro hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore afflaverint indigitamenta iſta deorum: nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar, quod vel ſolum horrorem incutere animo poteſt, nocturnum; cum enim totam diem conſumſerim in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plando urbis ſplendore, &amp; in adeundis, quibus ſcatet urbs illa, viris doctis; ſola nox reſtabat, quam Orpheo conſecrare potui.

As to the three Fates, or Deſtinies of the poets, they repreſented that part of the general ſyſtem of natural cauſes which relates to man, and to other mortal beings: for ſo we are told in the hymn addreſſed to them among the Orphic Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love), and, contrary to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar notion, are diſtinguiſhed by the epithet of gentle, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted. According to Heſiod, Theog. ver. 904, they were the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Jupiter and Themis; but in the Orphic Hymn to Venus, or Love, that Goddeſs is directly ſtiled the mother of Neceſſity, and is repreſented, immediately after, as governing the three Deſtinies, and conducting the whole ſyſtem of natural cauſes.</note>;</l>

On this account he was induced to attempt ſomewhat in the ſame manner; ſolely by way of exerciſe: the manner itſelf being now almoſt intirely abandoned in poetry. And as the meer genealogy, or the perſonal adventures of heathen gods, could have been but little intereſting to a modern reader; it was therefore thought proper to ſelect ſome convenient part of the hiſtory of nature, and to employ theſe ancient divinities as it is probable they were firſt employed; to wit, in perſonifying natural cauſes, and in repreſenting the mutual agreement or oppoſition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world: which hath been accounted the very higheſt office of poetry.</note> ſhell,</l>

                  <l>Exulting Pindar<note n="c" place="bottom">Pindar was contemporary with Ariſtides and Cymon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at his height. When Xerxes invaded Greece, Pindar was true to the common intereſt of his country; though his fellow-citizens, the Thebans, had ſold themſelves to the Perſian king. In one of his odes he expreſſes the great diſtreſs and anxiety of his mind, occaſioned by the vaſt preparations of Xerxes againſt Greece. (Iſthm, 8.) In another he celebrates the victories of Salamis, Plata, and Himera. (Pyth. 1.) It will be neceſſary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the next concerning him. Firſt then, he was thought to be ſo great a favourite of Apollo, that the prieſts of that deity allotted him a conſtant ſhare of their offerings. It was ſaid of him, as of ſome other illuſtrious men, that at his birth a ſwarm of bees lighted on his lips, and fed him with their honey. It was alſo a tradition concerning him, that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and ſeen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real hiſtorical fact in his life is, that the Thebans impoſed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expreſſed in his poems for that heroic ſpirit, ſhewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty, which his own fellow-citizens had ſhamefully betrayed. And, as the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ode implies, that <hi>great poetical talents, and high ſentiments of liberty, do reciprocally produce and aſſiſt each other,</hi> ſo Pindar is perhaps the moſt exemplary proof of this connection, which occurs in hiſtory. The Thebans were remarkable, in general, for a ſlaviſh diſpoſition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth; at the time of its ruin by Philip; and even in its beſt ſtate, under the adminiſtration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas: and every one knows, they were no leſs remarkable for great dulneſs, and want of all genius. That Pindar ſhould have equally diſtinguiſhed himſelf from the reſt of his fellow-citizens in both theſe reſpects ſeems ſomewhat extraordinary, and is ſcarce to be accounted for but by the preceding obſervation.</note> ſaw to full perfection brought.</l>

               <head>The DROPSICAL MAN.</head>
               <byline>By Mr. TAYLOR.</byline>
               <l>A JOLLY, brave toper, who could not forbear,</l>
               <l>Though his life was in danger, old port and ſtale beer,</l>
               <l>Gave the doctors the hearing—but ſtill would drink on,</l>
               <l>'Till the dropſy had ſwell'd him as big as a ton.</l>
               <l>The more he took phyſic the worſe ſtill he grew,</l>
               <l>And tapping was now the laſt thing he could do.</l>
               <l>Affairs at this criſis, and doctors come down,</l>
               <l>He began to conſider—ſo ſent for his ſon.</l>
               <l>Tom, ſee by what courſes I've ſhorten'd my life,</l>
               <l>I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five;</l>
               <l>More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours,</l>
               <l>This manor, this houſe, and eſtate will be yours;</l>
               <l>My early exceſſes may teach you this truth,</l>
               <l>That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth.</l>
               <l>Says Tom (who's a lad of a generous ſpirit,</l>
               <l>And not like young rakes, who're in haſte to inherit):</l>
               <l>Sir, don't be diſhearten'd; although it be true,</l>
               <l>Th' operation is painful, and hazardous too,</l>
               <l>'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'.</l>
               <l>And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young,</l>
               <l>Your life after this may be happy and long.</l>
               <l>Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply,</l>
               <l>With a jeſt in his mouth, and a tear in his eye:</l>
               <l>Too well by experience, my veſſels, thou know'ſt,</l>
               <l>No ſooner are tapp'd, but they give up the ghoſt.</l>

               <head>To the Worthy, Humane, Generous, Reverend, and Noble, Mr. FREDERICK CORNWALLIS, now Archbiſhop of CANTERBURY.</head>
               <byline>By Dr. SNEYD DAVIES. Written in the Year 1743.</byline>
               <lg>
                  <l>IN frolic's hour, ere ſerious thought had birth,</l>
                  <l>There was a time, my dear Cornwallis, when</l>
                  <l>Fancy would take me on her airy wing</l>
                  <l>And waft to views romantic; there diſplay</l>
                  <l>Some motley viſion, ſhade and ſun: the cliff,</l>
                  <l>O'erhanging ſparkling brooks and ruins grey,</l>
                  <l>Bade me meanders trace, and catch the form</l>
                  <l>Of varying clouds, and rainbows learn to paint.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Sometimes ambition, bruſhing by, would twitch</l>
                  <l>My ſpirits, and with winning look ſublime</l>
                  <l>Allure to follow. What though ſteep the track,</l>
                  <l>Her mountain's top would overpay, when climb'd,</l>
                  <l>The ſcaler's toil; her temple there was fine,</l>
                  <l>And lovely thence the proſpects. She could tell</l>
                  <l>Where laurels grew, whence many a wreath antique;</l>
                  <l>But more advis'd to ſhun the barren twig,</l>
                  <l>(What is immortal verdure without fruit?)</l>

                  <l>What, pauſe a moment when Ambition calls!</l>
                  <l>No, the blood gallops to the diſtant goal,</l>
                  <l>And throbs to reach it. Let the lame ſit ſtill.</l>
                  <l>When Fortune gentle, at the hill's verge extreme,</l>

                  <l>Had cater'd well, if ſtomach could digeſt</l>
                  <l>Her viands, and a palate not too nice.</l>
                  <l>Unfit ſhe ſaid, for perilous attempt,</l>

                  <l>Amid the gloomy ſcene of fir and yew,</l>
                  <l>On apple ground; where Morpheus ſtrew'd the bed:</l>
                  <l>Obſcurity her curtain round me drew,</l>
                  <l>And ſyren Sloth a dull quietus ſung.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>WHILE you, my dear girls, in your paradiſe ſtray,</l>
                  <l>Diverting with innocent freedom the day,</l>
                  <l>I wander alone in a barbarous land,</l>
                  <l>Half bak'd by the ſun, half blind by the ſand.</l>
                  <l>Then your wood too and grotto ſo ſwim in my ſight,</l>
                  <l>They give me no reſpite by day nor by night;</l>
                  <l>No ſooner aſleep but I'm dreaming of you;</l>
                  <l>I am juſt wak'd from one,—would to God it were true.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown,</l>
                  <l>And had got, Lord knows how, an eſtate of my own.</l>
                  <l>Good-bye to plain Tom, I was rais'd a peg higher;</l>
                  <l>Some call'd me his worſhip, and others the ſquire.</l>
                  <l>'Twas a place, I remember, exactly like Eaſton,</l>
                  <l>A ſcene for an emperor's fancy to feaſt on.</l>
                  <l>There I built a fine houſe with great coſt and great care,</l>
                  <l>(Your la'ſhips have form'd many ſuch in the air)</l>
                  <l>Not of ſtucco, nor brick, but as good Portland ſtone</l>

                  <l>That every one ſaid, I'd an excellent taſte.</l>
                  <l>Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf,</l>
                  <l>Kept a coach for my ſiſters, a nag for myſelf,</l>
                  <l>With ſomething that's good when our Highclear friends come,</l>
                  <l>And, ſpite of 'ſquire Herbert, a fire in each room.</l>
                  <l>A canal made for profit as well as for pleaſure,</l>

                  <l>Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown,</l>
                  <l>With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down.</l>
                  <l>An exceeding great wood, that's been ſet a great while,</l>
                  <l>In length near a league, and in breadth near a mile.</l>
                  <l>There every dear girl her bright genius diſplays,</l>
                  <l>In a thouſand fine whimſies a thouſand fine ways.</l>
                  <l>O how charming the walks to my fancy appear!</l>
                  <l>What a number of temples and grottos are here!</l>
                  <l>My ſoul was tranſported to ſuch an extreme,</l>
                  <l>That I leap'd up in raptures,—when lo! 'twas a dream.</l>
                  <l>Then vexing I chid the impertinent day</l>
                  <l>For driving ſo ſweet a deluſion away.</l>

                  <l>And hie to the place where they buried their gold:</l>
                  <l>There hov'ring around until morning remain;</l>

                     <l>Not like thoſe kings, who vainly ſeek renown,</l>
                     <l>From countries ruin'd, and from battles won;</l>

                     <l>Raiſing their titles by their God's diſgrace.</l>
                     <l>Like fame to bold Eroſtratus we give,</l>

                     <l>For by that name the Ruſſian king was known,</l>
                     <l>And ſure a nobler ne'er adorn'd the throne.</l>
                     <l>In war he knew the deathful ſword to wield,</l>

                     <l>He ſeem'd as he were made for peace alone;</l>
                     <l>Then was the golden age again reſtor'd,</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>One day, as he purſued the dang'rous ſport,</l>
                     <l>Attended by the nobles of his court,</l>

                     <l>The road he came, but could not find the track;</l>

                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0394600106:199"/>Still turning to the place he left before,</l>
                     <l>And only lab'ring to be loſt the more.</l>
                     <l>The bugle horn, which o'er his ſhoulders hung,</l>
                     <l>So loud he winded, that the foreſt rung;</l>
                     <l>In vain, no voice but Echo from the ground,</l>

                     <l>And the hoarſe thunder, growling from afar,</l>
                     <l>With herald voice proclaim'd th' approaching war;</l>
                     <l>Silence awhile enſu'd,—then by degrees</l>
                     <l>A hollow wind came mutt'ring through the trees.</l>
                     <l>Sudden the full-fraught ſky diſcharg'd its ſtore,</l>
                     <l>Of rain and rattling hail a mingled ſhower;</l>
                     <l>The active lightning ran along the ground;</l>
                     <l>The fiery bolts by fits were hurl'd around,</l>

                     <l>Penſive and unreſolv'd awhile he ſtood,</l>
                     <l>Beneath the ſcanty covert of the wood;</l>
                     <l>But drove from thence ſoon ſallied forth again,</l>
                     <l>As chance directed, on the dreary plain;</l>

                     <l>Caught in the thicket, flound'ring in the lake.</l>

                     <l>Oft-times he doubted, it appear'd ſo far,</l>
                     <l>And hung ſo high, 'twas nothing but a ſtar,</l>

               <byline>BY MR. ALSOP<note n="a" place="bottom">Anthony Alſop, the author of this dialogue and of the three ſubſequent poems, was educated in Weſtminſter college, and from thence elected to Chriſt Church in Oxford, where he took the degrees of M. A. March 23, 1696, and of <hi>B. D.</hi> Dec. 12, 1706. On his coming to the univerſity he was very ſoon diſtinguiſhed by Dean Aldrich. He paſſed through the uſual offices in his college to that of Cenſor with conſiderable reputation, and for ſome years had the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the ſociety committed to his care. In this uſeful employment he continued until his merits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Biſhop of Wincheſter, who appointed him his chaplain, and ſoon after gave him a prebend in his own Cathedral, together with the rectory of Brightwell, in the county of Berks, which afforded him ample proviſion for a learned retirement, in which he remained to the end of his days; and ſo well ſatisfied was he with a recluſe life, that he could not be drawn from it by the repeated ſolicitations of thoſe who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher ſtation. His death, which happened June 10, 1726, was occaſioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door, the path being narrow, and part of it giving way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</note>.</byline>

                  <l>IXION, as the poets tell us,</l>
                  <l>Was one of thoſe pragmatic fellows,</l>
                  <l>Who claim a right to kiſs the hand</l>
                  <l>Of the beſt lady in the land;</l>
                  <l>Demonſtrating, by dint of reaſon,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He let his fancy ſoar much higher;</l>
                  <l>And ventur'd boldly to aſpire</l>
                  <l>To Juno's high and mighty grace,</l>
                  <l>And woo'd the goddeſs face to face.</l>
                  <l>What mortal e'er had whims ſo odd,</l>
                  <l>To think of cuckolding a God?</l>
                  <l>For ſhe was both Jove's wife and ſiſter,</l>

                  <l>With every charm of face and mind;</l>
                  <l>Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes ſo blue,</l>

                  <l>He, over head and ears her lover,</l>
                  <l>Try'd all the ways he could to move her;</l>
                  <l>He ſigh'd, and vow'd, and pray'd, and cry'd,</l>

                  <l>She let him ſigh, and pray, and cry on—</l>
                  <l>But now hear more about Ixion.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Goddeſs, proud (as folks report her),</l>
                  <l>Diſdain'd that mortal wight ſhould court her,</l>
                  <l>And yet ſhe choſe the fool to flatter,</l>
                  <l>To make him fancy ſome great matter,</l>
                  <l>And hope in time he might get at her;</l>
                  <l>Grac'd him with now and then a ſmile,</l>
                  <l>But inly ſcorn'd him all the while;</l>
                  <l>Reſolv'd at laſt a trick to ſhew him,</l>

                  <l>Why, thus I find it in my book.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>She call'd a pretty painted cloud,</l>
                  <l>The brighteſt of the wand'ring crowd;</l>
                  <l>For ſhe, you know, is queen o'th' air,</l>

                  <l>Governs at will, by nod or ſummons,</l>
                  <l>As Walpole does the houſe of commons.</l>
                  <l>This cloud, which came to her ſtark-naked,</l>
                  <l>She dreſs'd as fine as hands could make it.</l>
                  <l>For her own wardrobe out ſhe brought</l>
                  <l>Whate'er was dainty, wove or wrought;</l>
                  <l>A ſmock which Pallas ſpun and gave her,</l>
                  <l>Once on a time to gain her favour;</l>
                  <l>A gown that ha'n't on earth its fellow,</l>
                  <l>Of fineſt blue, and lin'd with yellow,</l>
                  <l>Fit for a goddeſs to appear in,</l>
                  <l>And not a pin the worſe for wearing;</l>
                  <l>A quilted petticoat beſide,</l>

                  <l>As like herſelf, as like could be:</l>
                  <l>So like, that could not I or you know</l>
                  <l>Which was the cloud, and which was Juno.</l>
                  <l>Thus dreſs'd ſhe ſent it to the villain,</l>
                  <l>To let him act his wicked will on:</l>

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0394600106:268"/>Then laugh'd at the poor fool aloud,</l>
                  <l>Who for a goddeſs graſp'd a cloud.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>This, you will ſay, was well done on her</l>

                  <l>But more of him you need not hear;</l>
                  <l>Only to Strephon lend an ear.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He never entertain'd one thought</l>

                  <l>His ſpotleſs love might be forgiven</l>
                  <l>By every ſaint in earth and heaven.</l>

                  <l>And prais'd it far beyond its worth:</l>
                  <l>Mildly receiv'd his fond addreſs,</l>
                  <l>And only blam'd his love's exceſs:</l>

On the acceſſion of King George the Firſt he was appointed Secretary at War, and afterwards Cofferer of the Houſhold. In 1725 he detached himſelf from his connexions at court, and entered ſo warmly into oppoſition to the meaſures of the Crown, that on July 1, 1731, he was ſtruck out of the liſt of Privy Counſellors with the King's own hand, and at the ſame time ordered to be put out of every commiſſion of the peace.

                  <l>LOOK round the wide world, each profeſſion, you'll find,</l>
                  <l>Hath ſomething diſhoneſt, which myſt'ry they call;</l>
                  <l>Each knave points another, at home is ſtark-blind;</l>
                  <l>Except but his own, there's a cheat in them all:</l>
                  <l>When tax'd with impoſture, the charge he'll evade,</l>
                  <l>And like Falſtaff pretend he but lives by his trade.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The hero ambitious (like Philip's great ſon,</l>
                  <l>Who wept when he found no more miſchief to do)</l>
                  <l>Ne'er ſcruples a neighbouring realm to o'er-run,</l>
                  <l>While ſlaughters and carnage his ſabre imbrue.</l>
                  <l>Of rapine and murder the charge he'll evade,</l>
                  <l>For conqueſt is glorious, and fighting his trade.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The ſtateſman, who ſteers by wiſe Machiavel's rules,</l>
                  <l>Is ne'er to be known by his tongue or his face;</l>
                  <l>They're traps by him us'd to catch credulous fools,</l>
                  <l>And breach of his promiſe he counts no diſgrace;</l>
                  <l>But policy calls it, reproach to evade,</l>
                  <l>For flatt'ry's his province, cajoling his trade.</l>

                  <l>With all its vain pomp, for a kingdom on high;</l>
                  <l>While earthly preferments are chiefly his prize,</l>
                  <l>And all his purſuits give his doctrine the lye;</l>
                  <l>He'll plead you the goſpel, your charge to evade:</l>
                  <l>The lab'rer's entitled to live by his trade.</l>

                  <l>While black he by ſophiſtry proves to be white,</l>
                  <l>And falſehood and perjury liſts in his cauſe,</l>
                  <l>With ſteady aſſurance all crime will evade:</l>
                  <l>His client's his care, and he follows his trade.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>

                  <l>While poverty's left to diſeaſes a prey,</l>
                  <l>Are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade:</l>
                  <l>Their practice is great, and they ſhine in their trade.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Since then in all ſtations impoſture is found,</l>
                  <l>No one of another can juſtly complain;</l>
                  <l>The coin he receives will paſs current around,</l>
                  <l>And where he is couſen'd he couſens again:</l>

               <head>A LETTER FROM CAMBRIDGE TO MASTER HENRY ARCHER, A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AT ETON SCHOOL.</head>
               <byline>BY DR. LITTLETON<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Edward Littleton was educated upon the Royal foundation at Eton School, from whence he was tranſplanted to King's College, Cambridge, in the year 1716. After four years reſidence at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, he was recalled to Eton as an aſſiſtant in the ſchool, where he ſo greatly acquired the reſpect of the provoſt and fellows, that in 1727 they elected him into their ſociety, and preſented him to the living of Maple Derham, in Oxfordſhire. On June the 9th, 1730, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed chaplain in ordinary to their Majeſties, and in the ſame year took his Doctor of Laws degree at Cambridge. He died of a fever in the year 1734, and was buried in his own pariſh church of Maple Derham.</note>.</byline>

                        <p>This has been condemned as a falſe thought, and more worthy of an Italian poet than of Mr. Gray. Count Algarotti, we have found in his letter to Mr. How, praiſes it highly; but as he was an Italian critic, his judgment, in this point, will not, perhaps by many, be thought to overbalance the objection. The truth is, that this fiction of the cauſe of Milton's blindneſs is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility, any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of Shakſpeare; and therefore would be equally admiſſible, had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known: on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the judgment revolts againſt it. Milton himſelf has told us, in a ſtrain of heart-felt exultation, (ſee his Sonnet to Cyriac Skynner) that he loſt his eye-ſight, <q>
                              <l>—overply'd</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>And, when we know this to have been the true cauſe, we cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fictitious one, however ſublimely conceived, or happily expreſſed. If therefore ſo lofty and unrivalled a deſcription will not atone for this acknowledged defect, in relation to matter of fact, all that the impartial critic can do, is to point out the reaſon, and to apologize for the poet, who was neceſſitated by his ſubject to conſider Milton only in his poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal capacity.</p>
                        <p>Since the above note was publiſhed, Mr. Brand, of Eaſt-Dearham, in Norfolk, has favoured me with a letter, in which he informs me of a very ſimilar hyperbole extant in a MS. commentary upon Plato's Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, written by Hermias, a chriſtian philoſopher, of the ſecond century, and which is printed in Bayle's Dictionary (Art. Achilles.) It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the following anecdote of Homer:—<q>That keeping ſome ſheep near the tomb of Achilles, he obtained, by his offerings and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, a ſight of that hero; who appeared to him ſurrounded with ſo much glory that Homer could not bear the ſplendor of it, and that he was not only dazzled, but blinded by the ſight.</q> The ingenious gentleman makes no doubt but Mr. Gray took his thought from this paſſage, and applauds him for the manner in which he has improved upon it: he alſo thinks in general <q>that a deviation from hiſtorical truth, though it may caſt a ſhade over the middling beauties of poetry, produces no bad effect where the magnificence and brilliancy of the images entirely fill the imagination;</q> and with regard to this paſſage in prticular, he intimates, <q>that as the cauſe of Milton's blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſo well known as the thing itſelf, the licence of poetical invention may allow him to aſſign a cauſe different from the real fact.</q> However this may be, the very exact reſemblance, which the two thoughts bear to one another, will, I hope, vindicate Mr. Gray's from being a modern concetto in the taſte of the Italian ſchool, as it has been deemed to be by ſome critics. But this reſemblance will do more (and it is on this account chiefly that I produce, and thank the gentleman for communicating it); it will prove the extreme uncertainty of dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſix lines before us convey, perhaps, the moſt beautiful piece of imagery in the whole Ode, and were a wonderful improvement on thoſe which he firſt wrote; which, though they would appear fine in an inferior poet, are infinitely below thoſe which ſupplanted them.

From thence we are hurried, with the wildeſt rapidity, into the midſt of battle; and the epithet <hi>kindred</hi> places at once before our eyes all the peculiar horrors of civil war.

            <p>HAVING now, by the advice and aſſiſtance of my friends, brought this Collection of POEMS to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent ſize, it has been thought proper that the farther progreſs of its growth ſhould here be ſtopp'd. From the looſe and fugitive pieces, ſome printed, others in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, which for forty or fifty years paſt have been thrown into the world, and careleſsly left to periſh; I have here, according to the moſt judicious opinions I could obtain in diſtinguiſhing their merits, endeavour'd to ſelect and preſerve the beſt. The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with, demands my warmeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection; and in this reſpect, if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent, I ſhall hope to be allowed the merit, which is all I claim, of having furniſhed to the Public an elegant and polite Amuſement. Little more need be added, than to return my thanks to ſeveral inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious friends, who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment. If the reader ſhould happen to find, what I hope he ſeldom will, any pieces which he may think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of having been inſerte; as it would ill become me to attribute his diſlike of them to his own want of Taſte, ſo I am too conſcious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to impute the inſertion of them to mine.</p>
