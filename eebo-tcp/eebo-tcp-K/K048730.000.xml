            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of this Poem had begun one, on the Subject, many Years ago: but, doubting whether in the Plan he was proceeding on he had enough expreſs'd the Senſe of one who had the Bleſſing to be born and educated in a Land of <hi>Liberty,</hi> he had Diſcretion to ſtop ſhort: and has poſtpon'd its Publication, for above three Times the Space preſcrib'd by <hi>Horace</hi> for impartial Re-examination of a Poet's firſt Conceptions.—He now finds, from the Reſult of this Deliberation, that, tho' his General Purpoſe then was right, as but preferring the <hi>Monarchic,</hi> to the <hi>Popular</hi> Forms of Government; yet, had he, at That Time, gone through his Work, He was in Danger to have <hi>err'd,</hi> in one particular Point, of moſt eſſential Conſequence: reſtraining Monarchy to its <hi>too ſimple Species</hi>—where It verges to, and looks like, Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0670901400:4"/>Early Prejudices are imbib'd too deeply to be rooted out at once. Experience, and Reflection, have, ſince, taught him, to <hi>conjoin,</hi> Ideas, which, before, ſeem'd <hi>inconſiſtent:</hi> and to know and own, as he now does, that Monarchy is there moſt nobly conſtituted, where Crowns inveſt their Wearers with the moſt extenſive Power to <hi>guard,</hi> the Public Liberty: without Inducement to expect Increaſe of Happineſs, or Glory, from Attempts to <hi>violate</hi> it.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>That</hi> Difference, and no other, between the firſt, and preſent, Purpoſe of the Poem.—The Fabric is the ſame, as formerly: but It has firmer Ground, for its Foundation. —The <hi>Hebrew Syſtem</hi> is, and muſt be, <hi>Monarchy:</hi> but It is <hi>ſuch</hi> a Monarchy, as GOD may be ſuppos'd, without Affront to his beſt Attributes, to have eſtabliſh'd at the Head of a <hi>Free</hi> People: whom he would not, by a Waſte of <hi>uſeleſs</hi> Miracles, have brought up out of Slavery to an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyrant; to have left 'em <hi>Slaves again,</hi> in a worſe Country, under Tyrants, of their own Fraternity.</p>
            <p>The Plan, as it now ſtands, is ſtrictly conſonant to This Idea: And ſo little Difference could ariſe from the miſtaken <hi>Species,</hi> where the <hi>Genus</hi> was <hi>monarchical,</hi> that almoſt every thing, in the <hi>Poetic</hi> View, retains its Place, as in its firſt Production: with Exception only to That nobler Taſte of <hi>Freedom</hi>; which the Writer ow'd to a diſintereſted, ſilent, and ſincere Attachment, never confeſs'd, till now, to the unconſcious Object of it. Here, firſt, and much too late, his touch'd Heart call'd upon him to record the Obligation.</p>
            <p>It has been thought adviſable to publiſh only Three Books at a Time: and with the firſt the Notes belonging to it. Partly by way of Specimen: but chiefly becauſe relative to the Deſign, and general Conſtitution, of the <hi>Epic Species.</hi> —The Notes to All the Books, will, laſt, be publiſh'd, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0670901400:5"/>
Themſelves: and may be bound diſtinct from the Poetic Part: or be annex'd to Each Book relatively; making, ſo, <hi>Two</hi> Volumes; at Election of the Reader: who may alſo, in this Method, chuſe to take, or leave, the <hi>Notes,</hi> at his own Pleaſure.—The Remaining Three Parts, of the Poem, will be publiſh'd in like manner as This Firſt: and at the ſhorteſt Diſtances which can conſiſt with Care, in the Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and Correction of ſo large a Work, and where Variety of Subjects claim the cloſeſt Application, of a Writer, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible with what a Reverence Men ſhould appear before the Public Eye; who dare aſpire to being held in View, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Dimneſs of a preſent Proſpect.</p>
            <p>He preſumes to call his preſent Proſpect but a <hi>dim</hi> one, without Arrogance, or Satire: being equally remote from dreaming too <hi>ſublimely,</hi> or too <hi>deſpicably,</hi> of the Age and Nation he was doom'd to take his Fate in.—He, but too well, knows 'em not the beſt diſpos'd, in any Kind, for <hi>giving Fame to Epic Poetry:</hi> yet, muſt proteſt againſt ſo far misjudging his Cotemporaries as to ſuſpect it poſſible, that many ſhould not now be living, as completely qualify'd, as in whatever other Time, or Country, to know how far a Poet has deſerv'd their Notice: and refuſe it only, where It ought not to be granted.</p>
            <p>For the Reſt, he caſts his Hopes upon <hi>Futurity:</hi> and, having but a ſhort Reſerve of perſonal Claim to <hi>Time,</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Expectation of Survival, to this Child of Leiſure, His <hi>Poetic Repreſentative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has nothing further, here, to add, concerning it, the <hi>Notes</hi> being very circumſtantial, and explanatory: only, that the Work (which is of <hi>Epic,</hi> or <hi>Heroic,</hi> Species), had for Object, the chief Virtues of a People: <hi>Intrepidity,</hi> in foreign <hi>War</hi>—and Spirit of domeſtic <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0670901400:6"/>As for the <hi>Notes,</hi> they are not merely of <hi>poetical,</hi> or <hi>critical,</hi> Intention: but conſiſt, occaſionally, of enlarg'd Diſcourſes upon different Subjects, drawn from old and modern <hi>Hiſtory</hi>; to elucidate and give Examples, to, <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Deductions, which ariſe from <hi>Incidents,</hi> remark'd upon. They are, alſo, <hi>Military, Geographic,</hi> and <hi>Commercial:</hi> and include Variety of other Subjects: as the Reader will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in their Progreſs.</p>
            <p>Among theſe Reflections, it may poſſibly give Satisfaction to the Learn'd and Reverend Body of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to ſee the following three Points touch'd, in the new Lights here given them.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, That the fine <hi>Theocracy,</hi> of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Inſtitution, was deſtroy'd, in its Progreſſion, but by natural Conſequence of one political Defect (that has not been enough adverted to, by Writers on that Subject), <hi>the Military Care disjoin'd from the Imperial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Form of Government was never, as it has by Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> (and almoſt generally) been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, <hi>a Popular Republic:</hi> but a plain <hi>Hereditary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:</hi> the ſovereign Power whereof was veſted in the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi>'s Perſon.</p>
            <p>And 3dly, That, with Exception only to this laſt <hi>peculiar</hi> Circumſtance, there ariſe great Probabilities, toward finding in the firſt eſtabliſh'd <hi>Hebrew Model,</hi> the Original of All the manly <hi>Celtic Forms:</hi> and, in particular, of That, which conſtitutes the <hi>preſent Syſtem in Great Britain</hi>;—not relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its, known, ſound Principles.</p>
            <p>Thus much ſeem'd needful to premiſe. What reſts, will follow, with the <hi>Notes,</hi> conjunctively: Thoſe on the firſt Book being publiſh'd previouſly, becauſe explanatory of the <hi>General</hi> Purpoſe.</p>

               <head>NOTES AND Miſcellaneous REFLECTIONS ON The FIRST BOOK.</head>
               <p>BEFORE the Reader enters on the Notes, in referential Order, He will probably forgive a ſhort Remark or two upon the Nature of this Kind of Poem: The Age we live in, ſo profuſely overflowing in the Practice without ſtopping to conſider Judgment, that, to common Apprehenſions, Poetry gives no Idea but of <hi>Words with muſical Cadences:</hi> that is to ſay, plain Senſe, in <hi>Rhyme,</hi> and <hi>Meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may ſeem ſurpriſing, that Pretenders to this Faculty (few of us having been thought guilty of too little Senſibility) ſhould reſt contented, under the Injuſtice of ſo mortifying a Contraction!—A Poet, when conſider'd in this narrow Light, were ſo contemptible a Creature, that he muſt give Place to a good <hi>Piper:</hi> who unqueſtionably has Power of raiſing <hi>Sounds,</hi> much more melodious, than Adjuſters of mere <hi>Words</hi> are capable of equalling.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, Numbers, in their ſofteſt, and moſt pleaſing Fluency, make up but one Part of the <hi>Means,</hi> miſtaken for the <hi>End.</hi> They were deſign'd but as a Vehicle, that ſhould inſinuate the inſtructive <hi>Bitter,</hi> hid behind the Promiſe of <hi>Delight.</hi> The Muſic having gain'd the Ear, the Matter thence found Entrance to the Heart; and there prevail'd againſt Diſtempers, which, but for the fine Diſguiſe it came conceal'd in, it had never reach'd with ſuch Advantage; there being a Reluctance in our Nature apt to riſe againſt a plain Reproof; as, in our Taſte, againſt ſuch Phyſic, as is offer'd us too coarſely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0670901400:46"/>All, as far as this, was well. The worſt was, that this Sweetneſs in the Art expos'd it, by Degrees, to Profanation by the Ignorant. Prompt Adventurers were ſo glad, to find the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> the moſt <hi>Eaſy,</hi> that This Handmaid of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Poetry, like the treacherous <hi>Mayors</hi> of the <hi>Palace</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ſat her down in, and poſſeſs'd, the Throne, ſhe was deſign'd but as a Servant to.</p>
               <p>The Learn'd will favour me with their Indulgence, while I note, for Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Readers, of the Sex, that will be always ſureſt to hold Intereſt in a Poet's Purpoſes, that <hi>Epic</hi> Poems are ſo call'd, from a <hi>Greek</hi> Term for <hi>ſpeaking</hi>; becauſe, here, the Verſe runs <hi>narratively:</hi> as Stage Poems, on the contrary, are call'd <hi>Dramatic</hi> ones, from the ſame Tongue, in Reference to their being <hi>Acted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be ſtill more neceſſary, that ſome <hi>Definition</hi> of this Species ſhould be alſo given, by an Attempter of it, who has Modeſty, and wiſhes to avoid a Charge of high Preſumption: Critics having repreſented it in ſuch a formidable Light, that they could poſſibly have done no more, had they been join'd in a Confederacy to prevent Attempts to write at all, inſtead of furniſhing Inſtructions how to write diſcerningly.—It will ſuffice, to hear but one or two of Theſe, as Witneſſes. The Voice is all the ſame; one Note throughout the whole Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is (ſays <hi>Rapin</hi>) the moſt bold, and greateſt Work, that human Wit is capable of. All the Nobleneſs, and all the Elevation of the moſt perfect Genius can hardly ſuffice to form one ſuch as is requiſite. The Difficulty of finding, together, <hi>Fancy,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> Heat of Imagination, and Sobriety of Reaſon, Precipitation of Spirit, and Solidity of Mind, cauſes the Rarity of this Character's happy Temperament. It requires great Images, and yet a greater Wit to form them.—Finally, there muſt be a Judgment ſo ſolid, a Diſcernment ſo exquiſite, ſuch perfect Knowlege of the Language, in which he writes, ſuch obſtinate Study, profound Meditation, and vaſt Capacity, that ſcarce whole Ages can produce One Genius fit for an <hi>Epic Poem.</hi> And it is an Enterprize ſo bold, that it cannot fall into a wiſe Man's Thoughts but it muſt affright him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this Time, it grows needful, that I haſten to cry out, and own, that the moſt <hi>vain,</hi> and empty Wretch in Nature, would be ſuch a <hi>Poet</hi> as, conceiving the tenth Part of theſe prodigious Difficulties in his Way, which the <hi>French</hi> Critic had, by overheating his Imagination, taught himſelf to think were really there, ſhould, notwithſtanding ſuch Belief, have Arrogance enough to undertake a Work, ſo terribly beyond his Compaſs!—under which neceſſary Shield of honeſt Truth, I will dare venture yet a little farther,—into what our own Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> has declar'd on the ſame Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am apt (ſays he, in his <hi>Eſſay</hi> upon the Art we are conſidering) to believe ſo much, of the Genius of Poetry, and of its Elevation, in <hi>Homer</hi>'s and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s EPIC Works, that I know not, whether, of all the Numbers of Mankind, who live within the Compaſs of a thouſand Years, for One Man that is born, capable of making ſuch a Poet, there may not be a thouſand born,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0670901400:47"/>
capable of making as Great Generals of Armies, or Miniſters of State, as any the moſt renown'd in Story.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caveats,</hi> ſo high-ſtrained as Theſe, have made it neceſſary for an Epic Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker to ſay ſomething, That may juſtify his Modeſty. A Definition of it, therefore, in the humbler Light I ſee it by, may hope to ſhew it a leſs arduous Adventure; and demonſtrate, that the Difficulty, however certainly conſiderable, is by no means ſo inſuperable, as Theſe Gentlemen appear to think it. Critical Syſtems reconcile two contradictory Extremes: and are, at once, too <hi>vaſt,</hi> and too <hi>reſtrictive.</hi> The Cauſe is, they lean with a too partial Biaſs, toward a few Great Names: to whoſe Example they would chain down Nature.</p>
               <p>Many Friends of Fancy, on the other Side, miſtake for Epic Poems, any Story, told in Verſe, containing a wild Series of Romantic Incidents, related of ſome Hero, whom the Piece takes Name from. But there are ſcarce two Things in Nature, which more widely differ, than theſe Hiſtories in Verſe, from <hi>Epic Poetry.</hi>—I wiſh I could have ſatisfied myſelf with <hi>Boſſu</hi>'s Definition: It had ſav'd me the Preſumption of attempting one, myſelf. But <hi>His</hi> appearing to be neither <hi>full,</hi> nor <hi>clear</hi>; and having never ſeen a better; I am forc'd on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of hazarding a new one, of my own; which will, I fear, be, ſtill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
               <p>I take an <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> then, to mean ſome noble Leſſon in Morality, delivered under Colour of <hi>One Action,</hi> which muſt be illuſtrious and important, in Itſelf, and in its Perſonages, intereſt ſupernatural Powers in its Succeſſes, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, delightfully, and ſurpriſingly deſcribed, in Verſe; with ornamental <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodic Parts,</hi> depending on, and riſing naturally out of the main Tendency. Throughout all which the Poet keeps no view before him, but to ſtrengthen, by Example, That one moral Leſſon, he propoſes to imprint, upon his Reader's Admiration.</p>
               <p>To explain This Definition, by enlarging its Particulars.—A Man, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes an <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> is not to write a <hi>Hiſtory</hi>; but to propagate a <hi>Moral. Homer,</hi> for Example, had conceiv'd ſuch Purpoſe.—It was not his Deſign to write the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi>; That Story was already known; and could have brought no Novelty, but in the Pleaſure of the Verſes.—Pleaſure was not his chief End: He aim'd to give <hi>Advice.</hi> His Proſpect was, to teach the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſplit into little independent States, that <hi>Union could recover Victory, when Diſcord had transferr'd it to an Enemy.</hi> The <hi>Grecian's</hi> Triumph over <hi>Troy</hi> was then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of with much Vanity, through all their inconfederate Diviſions. <hi>Homer</hi> obſerv'd this Senſe of <hi>General Glory,</hi> and deriv'd a Story from it, that would beſt enforce the Moral, he prepar'd to teach 'em: borrowing Names, and Incidents from that remember'd, and high-boaſted War; but giving 'em a new, and proper Turn, for the Conveyance of his Moral only.—Had <hi>Homer</hi> not been born, till <hi>Alexander</hi> had made <hi>Greece</hi> one Monarchy, the Moral he would then have choſen had been the <hi>proſperous Effect of Power in one wiſe, and brave Man's Hand: and what ſure Benefits accrue from Subjects Loyalty.</hi> As, we ſee, <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0670901400:48"/>
living in a Time, when the Republic of the <hi>Romans</hi> had given Place to Monarchy, made it the Purpoſe of his Poem, to reconcile his Countrymen to ſingle Sovereignty in the Perſon of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> under Fiction of a Prince, brave, wiſe, and pious, who, being guided by the favouring <hi>Gods,</hi> eſtabliſh'd, on the Ruins, of the old, a new Foundation, for Dominion of ſo much more Potency, that the whole Empire of the World was, by Decree of Heaven, to be included in it.—From That new Empire, then poſſeſs'd by Thoſe he writ to, All his Readers had deriv'd their Glory: ſo that it was eaſy to induce them to confide in, and to look for, the ſame Bleſſings from <hi>their</hi> Change of Government, which their great <hi>Anceſtors</hi> had gain'd, by Change of Country.</p>
               <p>To impreſs the Moral forcibly, ſome <hi>Action</hi> is to be related, pointing out an Inſtance, in as ſtrong a Light as poſſible, where this inſinuated Moral was prov'd good by an <hi>Example.</hi>—The Action muſt be <hi>ſuitable:</hi> That is, of Dignity adapted to the Greatneſs of Events wrought into it, as Steps toward the Reſult laſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. It muſt be <hi>ſingle:</hi> That is, unmix'd with other Actions of detach'd, or independent Tendency. There may be Incidents producing Incidents, the more Variety the better: but they muſt be ſuch, as ſerve but to bring forward, and illuſtrate, the One final Action, which intends Example from the Work. Neither is <hi>this</hi> Reſtriction any Nicety deduc'd from the particular Opinion of This Critic, or of That: It is a natural Neceſſity; and a Law of Reaſon; becauſe Actions not producing one another, as Effects from Cauſes, raiſe unpointed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Reflections; and divert, and weaken an Attention, which it is the Buſineſs of This Poem to bind down to one ſtrong Object. An Epic Poet, of the <hi>Arioſtine</hi> Model, is a Traveller, who, if his Road lay ſtrait through <hi>Crete,</hi> would take the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> in his Journey.</p>
               <p>The Action may be <hi>feign'd,</hi> or <hi>real:</hi> If no Story, fam'd in Hiſtory, can be directly levell'd to the Poet's Purpoſe, He may, then, invent one, to his Liking: For the <hi>Truth,</hi> here neceſſary, conſiſts not in the Reality of the Events, but in the natural Veracity exiſting in the <hi>Moral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be <hi>illuſtrious,</hi> and <hi>important</hi>; and the Perſons animating it, <hi>Great Princes,</hi> or diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Leaders:</hi> becauſe Every Man ſubmits to ſhrink, at Conſciouſneſs of Dangers, or Misfortunes, which he ſees have Power to puniſh Error in theſe <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> The Weakneſs of our Pride (that, looking down upon, conceives Itſelf ſecure, in its ſuperior Situation, from all abject Miſery) not daring to exempt itſelf from Menaces, It muſt <hi>look up</hi> to: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, in this Caſe, the Apprehenſion of its own Expoſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It muſt intereſt ſupernatural Powers in its Succeſſes</hi>; the Influence of well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Circumſtances, of this Kind, carrying <hi>Terror</hi> with it, that excites a Reverence, and induces Warmth, from <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> Awefulneſs, into the Subject; conſonant to thoſe Impreſſions we are educated to religious Senſe of: and which favour Diſpoſition to derive All <hi>Good</hi> Propenſities from <hi>Heaven</hi>; and throw off upon the <hi>Devil,</hi> all Inſtigations, which propel to <hi>bad</hi> ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0670901400:49"/>It muſt be <hi>probably, delightfully,</hi> and <hi>ſurpriſingly,</hi> deſcribed in Verſe.—<hi>Probably,</hi> becauſe whatever we ſuppoſe impoſſible, we find unworthy our Attention. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully,</hi> becauſe Variety of well-mark'd Characters, ſurpriſing Incidents, ſmooth-flowing Numbers, Strength of Imagery, exalted Thoughts, and beautiful Expreſſion, keep awake our Expectation, ſtimulate the Fancy, and detain us, to the Author's Purpoſe.—And <hi>ſurpriſingly</hi> is added ſeparately, tho' a connected Conſequence, and unavoidable Reſult, from ſuch a well-maintain'd Succeſſion of unlook'd for, and ſtill varying, Beauties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiſodes</hi> are neceſſary Members of extended Action: which, without them, would appear too ſhort, and general. But all theſe Epiſodic Members muſt be <hi>Limbs,</hi> not <hi>Wens:</hi> They muſt unite with ſuch Connexion, that diſplacing any <hi>One,</hi> will make the Reſt imperfect; and that <hi>adding Any</hi> would diſgrace the Symmetry.</p>
               <p>In general, the Note moſt capable of height'ning our Regard to, and elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the aſſerted Force of <hi>Epic Poetry,</hi> is from a Recollection, that it comes down recommended to us by a Choice and Practice, that to Reaſon, joins the <hi>beſt</hi> AUTHORITY.—<hi>And without</hi> a Parable, <hi>ſpoke He not to them.</hi> Being aſk'd by his Diſciples, WHY <hi>ſpeakeſt thou to Them in Parables?</hi> His Anſwer is, <hi>Becauſe to</hi> YOU <hi>it is given to underſtand the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; but to</hi> THEM <hi>it is</hi> NOT <hi>given.</hi> That is, the Obſtinacy of theſe People's Minds, miſled by Habitudes of Evil, makes it neceſſary, that the Doctrine, I would teach them, ſhould be cover'd, and approach attractively: where, elſe, the Pride, that alienates their Hearts, would riſe againſt <hi>Conviction,</hi> preſs'd too plainly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd <hi>without Diſguiſe</hi>; as Humble Men like <hi>you</hi> are willing to receive it.</p>
               <p>It is probable, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> carried with 'em, out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> this delightful Way of teaching; It is clear, at leaſt, that they arriv'd to great Perfection in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Greece</hi> grew civiliz'd from rude Barbarity. So far is it from true, that <hi>Homer,</hi> or ſome other Poet of his Country, was Inventer of the <hi>Epic</hi> Species. All the Books of the Old Teſtament abound with Inſtances, which prove the Skill of <hi>Hebrew Poets.</hi> And the Six hundred thouſand Volumes in the <hi>Ptolemaic Library</hi> could hardly fail to have contain'd ſome of their Poems of this Kind, in their due Length and Dignity.</p>
               <p>To ſhew how little Difference there is, except in Ornament, and Size, between the Epic Poem, as above defined, and the ſhort Parables, I have been ſpeaking of, I will ſelect <hi>Two</hi> only: the firſt, taken from the Mouth of <hi>Chriſt Himſelf.</hi> The other I will go ſo far more backward for, as to the Reign of <hi>David,</hi> who was King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo ſoon after the <hi>Trojan War,</hi> that he muſt neceſſarily have liv'd before the Time of <hi>Homer,</hi> to whom <hi>Greece</hi> would partially aſcribe the Merit of poetically teaching moral Truth by Fable. I ſhall give more Inſtances than one, of the unwarrantable Preſumption of thoſe <hi>Grecians</hi> Vanity, in arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating to Themſelves a Praiſe for Arts they borrow'd from the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> People; and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0670901400:50"/>The Perſecution of the Prophets, by the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts,</hi> was what <hi>Chriſt</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to <hi>reprove:</hi> but knew, their Power was great; and that the Pride, It had inſpir'd 'em with, would render a diſtaſteful Doctrine little Fruit, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagingly inſinuated. Under this Conviction, the Divine Reprover thus addreſſes them. <q>There liv'd, ſays he, in a far Country, a powerful Land-owner, who had planted Vineyards, rais'd Incloſures, and built habitable Farms, on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd Part of his Territory. He let out Theſe to Huſbandmen; and went, Himſelf, to where his chief Seat ſtood; upon a very diſtant Tract of his Poſſeſſions.—When the proper Seaſon came, the Lord ſent Servants to demand his Rents grown due. But thoſe ungrateful Tenants, truſting to the Diſtance for Security from due Revenge, inſtead of Payment, <hi>murder'd</hi> the Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; They deſtroy'd in the ſame Manner, other Servants, ſent with like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: At laſt, reſolv'd to try their Boldneſs to the utmoſt, His own <hi>Son</hi> was ſent, to whom, it was ſuppos'd, they could not dare refuſe their Reverence. But the Tenants, on the Heir's Appearance, hoping, by <hi>His</hi> Death, to make Themſelves a laſting Title to the whole Inheritance, determin'd on That exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Deed; and kill'd <hi>Him alſo:</hi>
                  </q>
—The Auditors inflam'd to an impatient Indignation, interrupt the Story, in this Part of it, and cry out angrily— <q>The Lord ſhould have deſtroyed Thoſe wicked Wretches, and let out his Vineyard to honeſter Huſbandmen.</q>
And, there, condemn'd by their own Sentence, and ſtruck dumb by conſcious Shame, they catch the <hi>Application,</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to make it: for, as the Text expreſſes it, <hi>They conſider'd his Parable, and perceiv'd, that he ſpoke of</hi> Them.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Inſtance, <hi>Nathan</hi> reproaches <hi>David,</hi> who had robb'd <hi>Uriah</hi> of his Wife, and caus'd the Huſband to be murder'd. But the Prophet, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding well the Danger of the King's Reſentment, caſts about to take him by Surprize, and does it under this Diſguiſe of <hi>Parable.</hi> 
                  <q>I am come, ſays he, to aſk Relief from Royal Juſtice, in Revenge of a poor Sufferer's Diſtreſs, againſt the Cruelty of his Oppreſſor. Two Men liv'd together: one rich, the other poor. The rich Man had exceeding many Flocks and Herds; but the poor Man had nothing, ſave one little Ewe-Lamb, which he had bought, and nouriſh'd up: and it grew up together with Him, and with his Children. It eat of his own Meat, and drank of his own Cup, and lay in his Boſom, and was unto him as a Daughter.

Had

                  <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpoke the Truth thus plainly, at its opening, It had prov'd, perhaps, of dangerous Conſequence to his own Life: but the Cloud of the Invention ſhielded him; and the King's Paſſions having firſt been artfully ſecur'd in the Reproacher's Intereſt, the Reproach'd, who had confeſs'd a generous Senſe of the Diſhoneſty, while not conſider'd as his own, became aſham'd to diſavow his Virtue, when the Guilt laid Claim to his Confeſſion. So <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Nathan,</hi> 
                  <q>—I have ſinn'd againſt the Lord.</q>
—It is impoſſible to produce a livelier, or more pathetic, Proof, both of the Nature and the Power of <hi>Epic Poetry:</hi> For it is evident, that theſe Two <hi>Parables</hi> differ in nothing, but their Want of Names, Extent, and Paint of Circumſtance, from the <hi>Poems</hi> of That Nomination.</p>
               <p>From their general Nature, I proceed to the particular Conſideration of this new Attempt, upon the Plan of <hi>Gideon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Poet, in an Age ſo factious as the Laſt has been, muſt have been blind, not to diſcern the Uſefulneſs of recommending <hi>Quiet,</hi> to a ſtormy Generation. It were ſaying nothing to the Purpoſe, to object, that we are now remote from <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Caſe, under no Yoke of Conqueſt, and above all Danger from a foreign Enemy. Civil Conteſt will be always the moſt likely Means of calling in, and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Attempts of, ſuch an Enemy. We have ſeen too recent Proofs, to doubt that Certainty. But, not to dwell unneceſſarily upon our preſent happy Proſpects, our invaded Anceſtors, too often, felt the Weight of ſuch a Situation, as had made a <hi>Gideon</hi> the moſt welcome Public Bleſſing.—Could they have <hi>found</hi> him, and could all his <hi>Miracles</hi> have ſerv'd but to unite them in <hi>one</hi> Wiſh, and <hi>one</hi> Endeavour, far leſs laſting, and leſs bloody, had Thoſe various Inſults, then, been repreſented, under the Diſgrace whereof our Hiſtory bluſhes, while it tells the Triumphs of ſo many Conqueſts over us,—by <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans!</hi>—Where, therefore, is the Nation to be found, that better ought to like, than Ours, a ſtrong <hi>Example,</hi> to ſo ſound a Moral, as, that <hi>tho' Diſunion ſhould enſlave a People, joint Attachment to the Legal Government could ſoon recover, and protect loſt Liberty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To cloathe this Moral in an <hi>Action,</hi> ſome ſuch diſunited People was to be made Choice of, ſuff'ring under foreign Conqueſt, from Effect of their Diviſions, and, when every human Hope had fail'd 'em, rais'd, at once, from their Deſpair, by Union of an inconſiderable Number, under a Reſtorer of their Laws and Freedom.</p>
               <p>This being what the Critics call the Allegorical, or General, Plan, I never could have found a fitter <hi>Action</hi> to illuſtrate it, than the Redemption of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> under <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Conduct, from the Yoke of foreign Conqueſt, as impos'd with infinite Contempt and Cruelty, by a confederate Body of <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes; whom the ſacred Writ diſtinguiſhes by the joint Name of <hi>Midianites.</hi> For the Events of this great War are, <hi>there,</hi> ſo comprehenſively related, as to ſuit at once with the Deſign, they are ſelected for, and leave ſufficient Scope for bold Invention, and Embelliſhment, in the particular Deduction. Whereas the Scripture Hiſtory of <hi>David</hi> (Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Choice) was a <hi>completed</hi> one, as Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> has objected to it, and is ſo circumſtantially deſcrib'd, as to reſtrain a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0670901400:52"/>
Poet's Fancy. Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> for this Reaſon, could not have ſucceeded, in That favourite Deſign of His, for forming a new Epic Poem from the Story of our Civil Wars in the laſt Century. Yet, I remember he has ſomewhere told us, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, whom he had acquainted with his Purpoſe, very much approv'd it: notwithſtanding which, I take it to have been to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of That Great Man's Memory, that his Deſign was never executed. The Story was too recent, to be treated, as it ought; and the ſublimeſt Beauties of Invention would have loſt their Force on Readers, in whom ſad and deep Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, from the Miſery of the real Facts, muſt needs have made All Fiction ſeem too <hi>ſportive,</hi> and an unbecoming Freedom taken with their ſolemn Sorrow. It was the very Caſe of <hi>Lucan</hi>; and his Subject barring out all Aids of the Poetic Kind, at leaſt Thoſe warm ones, which let looſe Imagination, his <hi>Pharſalia</hi> gain'd no Rank but among <hi>Hiſtories</hi>; and <hi>Verſe,</hi> indeed, is all the Right of That great Work to be conſider'd, as a <hi>Poem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mention, here, of Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> leads me to remember an Objection, which, I think, he has unjuſtly made to Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Choice of Subject, merely as a foreign one: as if it were a Violation of that natural Reſpect, a Poet owes his Country, to look out of it, for a great Character! If Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> had no better Reaſon for this Cenſure, than that ſince <hi>Homer</hi> was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and has writ of <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> being a <hi>Roman,</hi> writ of <hi>Romans,</hi> therefore, Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> ſhould have approv'd no other than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hero, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appears, to me, to be a very narrow, and mean-ſpirited one.—Nature is Nature every-where; and I ſhould never look for any Force of manly Reaſoning, from a Soul not large enough, to comprehend Mankind as One Fraternity.— However, more is to be ſaid, in Favour of a <hi>Hebrew</hi> Subject, than of All, or Any of, the Reſt, whatever.—The Reverence, we conceive, from the Old Teſtament, for Thoſe Objects of God's more immediate Care, has made Them <hi>Every Body's Countrymen.</hi> Beſides, the many <hi>Miracles,</hi> ſo terribly diſplay'd among them, are peculiar Helps, to a Poetic Fancy; and adorn their Hiſtory, above that of <hi>Any</hi> other Nation. Their Country was the Scene, too, of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Life, and Sufferings, a Reflection, which entitles it to Veneration, from All <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And, to add one ſmaller Circumſtance, that ſtill gives Strength|'ning to their Claim, They were Inventers, or, at leaſt, Improvers, and great Practiſers, of <hi>Poetry.</hi> The <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> their firſt Leader, liſts Him early in the Number.—<hi>Miriam, Deborah, David, Solomon,</hi> and innumerable other of their Nation, were fine Poets. And This ought, methinks, to recommend their Memory to the Reſpect of ſuch, who would be thought ſo, after them.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, the Reader, I believe, will hardly be diſpleas'd to ſee a <hi>Specimen</hi> of <hi>Hebrew Poetry.</hi> We meet with many noble ones, in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they have the Misfortune to lie ſhadow'd under obſolete Tranſlation. —One of our Critics has done Juſtice to the noble Images of theſe Originals, when he declares, that <hi>there is nothing, ſo ſoft, ſo tender, and pathetic, and at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0670901400:53"/>
the ſame Time, nothing ſo grand, ſo majeſtic, ſo terrible; and ſo barmonious, as the Poetic Part of the Bible: to which All the Heathen Verſe is flat, and low.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I look upon the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, was written in <hi>Hexameter Verſe,</hi> to have been a Kind of <hi>Lyric Ode,</hi> becauſe it ſeems to have been ſung, to ſome String-Muſic, and to certain meaſur'd Motions of the Body. This is plainly gather'd from the Text. <q>And <hi>Miriam</hi> the Propheteſs, the Siſter of <hi>Aaron,</hi> took a <hi>Timbrel</hi> in her Hand, and all the Women follow'd her, with <hi>Timbrels,</hi> and with <hi>Dances.</hi>
                  </q>
—And, when <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the male Singers, had open'd the Ode, <hi>Miriam,</hi> and the Women, anſwer'd, as a <hi>Chorus,</hi> 
                  <q>Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumph'd gloriouſly: The Horſe, and his Rider, hath he thrown into the Sea!</q>
               </p>

               <p>It has been attack'd, but, ſince we learn'd to <hi>read,</hi> and underſtand, <hi>Blank Verſe,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s noble Work: which (by the way) lay half an Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

The Copy of it was (with <hi>Doubt</hi> and <hi>Heſitation</hi>) bought—for infamous TEN POUNDS! which not being made demandable but on Condition of a <hi>new Impreſſion,</hi> never was receiv'd, at all; Its Author having been in his neglected Grave near Thirty Years, before his matchleſs Poem (and <hi>then</hi> only by Effect of <hi>One</hi> Man's ſingle Penetration) drew the leaſt Regard upon it from his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men! to the eternal Scandal be it noted, of our high-preſum'd Diſcernment, and the miſerable State of <hi>Patronage,</hi> among us!—This was the hoſpitable Welcome Blank Verſe found, in <hi>England:</hi> And, <hi>now</hi> (ſo ſtrangely can our Currents <hi>turn!</hi>) our Gentlemen of the new Light are indiſpos'd to <hi>ſee,</hi> by <hi>any other.</hi> They affect the Reputation of a Judgment too ſevere, to be delighted by Effect of <hi>Sounds:</hi> and would explode all Conſonance of Termination, as too trifling, and effeminate, for Ears of Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>What they have objected may, I think, be ſumm'd up in theſe few Particulars. <hi>Rhyme</hi> was a <hi>Goth,</hi> and came in with the <hi>Runic</hi> Impoliteneſs: Rhyme is <hi>unnatural:</hi> becauſe it puts Conſtraint upon Expreſſion: Rhyme is <hi>needleſs</hi>; becauſe Blank Verſe has nobler Harmony, and gives complete Delight without it.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of Theſe, 'tis quite miſtaken. Rhyme <hi>did not</hi> come in with thoſe Barbarities, they charge it to: and, if it <hi>had</hi> done ſo, what nobler Parentage could It have been deriv'd from, than the <hi>ſame to which we owe our Plans of Liberty?</hi> But, in Reality, It had a far more antient Origin. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Poetry was writ with Rhyme. The <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Arabian,</hi> ſo peculiarly depended on this Ornament, that they have a Kind of Poem in diſtinguiſh'd Reverence among them (and call'd <hi>Cacideh</hi>) deriv'd from immemorial Practice, and devoted to the Praiſe of GOD, and godlike Characters.

Some of them appear to have been moderniz'd <hi>Reductions</hi> (as our <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Works, by <hi>Dryden</hi>) their old Language being grown obſcure, in Both of the Countries above-mentioned.—So, this Argument, of Rhyme's Defect from want of due Antiquity, will carry little Weight againſt it; and might have an Anſwer ſtill more pointed and particular, if it deſerv'd to be allow'd, that Any-thing, in its own Nature good, could be the leſs ſo, for its <hi>Novelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They call Rhyme <hi>unnatural,</hi> becauſe it puts Conſtraint upon Expreſſion; which, however, is <hi>not true</hi>; for Poets have not only Liberty of <hi>changing</hi> ſtubborn Rhymes for ductile ones, but are <hi>oblig'd to do it,</hi> till they find ſuch new ones, as <hi>aſſiſt</hi> the Senſe, inſtead of ſtiffening, or obſcuring it.

               <p>Rhyme, then, is neither <hi>newer,</hi> in its Practice, nor leſs <hi>natural,</hi> in its Uſe, than other Licences to Verſe, which, yet, its Enemies are very partially attach'd to.—We will ſee, in the <hi>laſt</hi> Charge, whether It ought to be held <hi>needleſs,</hi> from Superiority of Harmony, or any nobler, or more maſculine Perfection in <hi>Blank Verſe</hi>—or Meaſure without Conſonance.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> one of the firſt Fallers in with the Applauſe of <hi>Milton</hi> (newly, in <hi>His</hi> Time, beginning to attract Conſenters), writes his <hi>Eſſay on tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Verſe,</hi> in the beſt <hi>Rhyme</hi> he found Himſelf at Leiſure to afford it: But, drawing near the End, and growing out of Humour with his Choice, breaks out at once into a rapturous Declamation, againſt <hi>Rhyme,</hi> and <hi>Bondage</hi>; in a Specimen, which he picks, here and there, and pieces artfully together, out of ſome of the ſublimeſt Parts of <hi>Paradiſe loſt,</hi> to recommend Blank Verſe, where He, Himſelf, had juſt been diſregarding it. I think this Manner of proceeding not a fair one: The ſtrong Images, which animate the glowing Lines, he there ſelected, would have made <hi>Proſe,</hi> Poetry. They ſhake the Fancy, and allow no Leiſure to the Judgment to examine <hi>Numbers.</hi>—We are hurried on by the Exaltedneſs of Thought, and riſe above Perception of the Mechaniſm! Would he have try'd the Cauſe impartially, he might have found a thouſand Lines in <hi>Milton,</hi> every one of which had turn'd it quite to the Reverſe of his Intention.</p>
               <p>But now, to let the Reader ſee, what Kind of Verſe it is, theſe Gentlemen would ſubſtitute in Place of Rhyme, I take the following Pattern from the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Lord's Tranſlation of the <hi>Ars Poetica.</hi>

               <p>If the Enemies to Rhyme had nothing better to produce in Room of it, than <hi>This,</hi> It would not fail to <hi>live</hi> and proſper; nor, indeed, is there an Argument they uſe for the Defence of their Opinion, but might better aid their Enemies; and ſerve (as moſt Deſerters do) with double Violence, againſt its Maſters. Meanwhile It is a pleaſant Kind of Tyranny they are for exerciſing over Reaſon! Firſt, they warp to their own Side the Pretence of Right to Harmony: and when they have apply'd all Sorts of Argument, unjuſtly, for their Service, and left none for ours, but what they think they may refuſe us, as of <hi>Counſel for the Plaintiff,</hi> they would run us down, full Cry, as if we had no Weapons to defend ourſelves withal.—It puts me in Mind of an honeſt <hi>Indian Traveller,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in hard Weather, to aſk ſomething, at the Houſe of a Great Man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bark'd at by his <hi>Maſtives,</hi> ſtoop'd for a Flint, but found it frozen to the Surface.

               <p>In <hi>Tragedy,</hi> Blank Verſe may claim a <hi>Preference,</hi> as coming nearer to our natural Mode of Speech, and yet retaining Dignity enough, by virtue of its Meaſure, to exalt it above <hi>Proſe.</hi> But <hi>Epic</hi> Poets ſpeak in Perſon; and, deſcribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at full Leiſure, are ſuppos'd to have due Time for <hi>Ornament</hi>; and it will therefore be expected from them: ſo that Blank Verſe does not ſuit <hi>Their</hi> Uſe; ſince where its Flatneſs is not animated, as in Tragedy, by reſtleſs Agitation of the Paſſions, It muſt ever lean to one of theſe Extremes: either degenerating to plain Proſe, as in the Example before us; or becoming harſh, affected, ſtiff, and obſolete; as but too many Times it does, in our Great <hi>Milton,</hi> from a Purpoſe to induce Appearance, of the <hi>Venerable,</hi> where the <hi>Sweet</hi> was wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0670901400:62"/>
No <hi>one Note,</hi> indeed, will make a <hi>Tune:</hi> But, as we hear with Pleaſure the ſame Note ſounded ſometimes twice, or thrice (in ſolemn Compoſitions more eſpecially), and then give way to different ones, the artful Intermixture of All which is <hi>Muſic,</hi> ſo any tuneful Note, tho' ſounded ſeparately, and more than once, is <hi>Harmony.</hi>—No JARRING Note can ſtand in Muſic. <hi>Diſcord</hi> there muſt be; but That Diſcordance is to riſe, from Oppoſitions <hi>All harmonious</hi> in their proper, and disjunctive Particles: and but differing (not <hi>claſhing</hi>) into Melody, by joint Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency of <hi>Variations</hi>; not of <hi>Inconſiſtencies.</hi>—Neither will it be needful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that Rhymes are <hi>Uniſons.</hi> The Queſtion is of no Importance, or it would be eaſy to explain their Difference.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon in Behalf of Rhyme is, that no Language is ſo naturally form'd, as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for receiving and becoming it. The <hi>Latin</hi> Verſe, tormented and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, as I have ſhewn it, in Purſuit of Harmony, could no way have admitted <hi>This:</hi> which that it was not in its Genius conſtituted for, or capable of, we need no plainer Proofs, than the ſequeſter'd Muſes of the <hi>Monks</hi> have furniſh'd us— if ever <hi>Muſe,</hi> at all, inſpir'd a <hi>Monaſtery.</hi>

               <p>But Peace be to the <hi>Manes</hi> of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues!

What has been hinted, of <hi>Italian,</hi> will effectually include the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>; the <hi>German</hi> muſt be own'd worth great Regard for its Antiquity, and Manlineſs; but will content itſelf with That juſt Praiſe, and claim no Merit from its Harmony. Whatever Roughneſs <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be thought to have retain'd, is but of <hi>Saxon Origin</hi>; and, to acknowlege a too obvious Truth, Poetry in <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> is like the <hi>Nile</hi> among its <hi>Cataracts:</hi> It may be rapid, and deep; but 'tis tumbling, and terrible: It has its Courſe obſtructed, every-where, by Mountains it muſt clamber over.—To carry Poetry ſtill further North, would be but drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her to ſeek for Friends, among her Enemies, the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> then, of modern Tongues, is fitted beſt for Poetry. Its copious Choice of <hi>Monoſyllables</hi> (which many have been raſh enough to call a <hi>Blemiſh</hi>) make it ſtrong, ſignificant, and comprehenſive. Its Derivatives, from <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> have adorn'd it with Variety of Cadences; and intermix'd its maſculine Exceſs of Conſonants with a melodious Fluency, from interpoſing Vowels.—It adorns, and is adorn'd by, <hi>Rhyme</hi>; yet takes it in but as a Subject, not obeys it, as her Tyrant: It is grave, ſlow, ſtately, ſoft, ſwift, wanton, or majeſtic. It
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0670901400:66"/>
has all the Lentor of Complaint and Pity; yet has all the Tranſport of excurſive Energy: It is an inexhauſtibly full Treaſury, ſupplied from the ſelected Tributes of whatever was moſt excellent, in other Speeches; but poſſeſſes them with ſo improv'd an Aptitude, as to have made <hi>That</hi> HONEY, which was raw <hi>Juice,</hi> in the Flowers It drew it from.</p>
               <p>But I digreſs too far from what I had begun to ſay, upon the Structure of my Verſe, which differs little from a Species, Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> toward the Cloſe of the laſt Century, firſt reduc'd to Practice, and miſnam'd <hi>Pindaric:</hi> But if he conceiv'd a <hi>Greek</hi> Name neceſſary, <hi>Dithyrambic</hi> had, I think, expreſs'd his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe better. From the Latitude of ſo diverſify'd a Numeroſity, there muſt ariſe a fuller Harmony, than can conſiſt with common Meaſure. Elſe, a Concert can be equall'd by a ſingle Inſtrument: our uſual Couplet-writing ſooner ſatiates, by too frequent, and too limited Returns, of the ſame Meaſure. Whereas, in this perpetual Change of Cadence, and new Courſe of Numbers, the Attention is beat up, provok'd, and render'd lively; the Ear, every-where, reliev'd; and Images of Actions, Sounds, or Things, how different ſoever they may be, are cloath'd with Words, beſt ſuited to their Nature.</p>
               <p>The Compaſs, and the Freedom of this Range of Verſe, have recommended its Attempt to many Practiſers in <hi>Odes,</hi> and ſuch brief Sallies; but, too generally, with bad Succeſs: They check'd the Gracefulneſs of Stepping, by too viſible a <hi>Fear</hi> to <hi>fall.</hi> Like Children, who, firſt learn to go alone, they took ſhort, tottering Starts; and hung upon, and reſted at, All ſtopping Places, they could ſtretch their Hands to. They confin'd their Muſe, too humbly, to a <hi>Lyric</hi> Length of Leading-ſtrings: and gave the ſnug, ſet, round-head <hi>Crop,</hi> to Stanzas, that ſhould flow out <hi>cavalierly. Pindaric,</hi> in ſhort Meaſure, is a Woman of Quality, in Knee-deep Petticoats; ſhe may have very well-ſhap'd Feet: but they can never be ſo fine, as to atone the <hi>Indecorum. Lyric</hi> Numbers carry ſong-like and familiar Levity, quite inconſiſtent with the <hi>Epic</hi> Gravity. A few bold Writers of <hi>Pindaric Odes</hi> have ventur'd, now-and-then, as far as the <hi>Hexameter:</hi> but hardly dar'd ſo much as dream of the <hi>Heptametrical</hi> ſeven-footed Line, of fourteen Syllables: Indeed the ſhorteſt Meaſure is too long, unleſs That Length is fill'd with Meaning. For nothing can be more ridiculous, than a weak lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Extent of Verſe without proportion'd Vigour in the Sentiment: Such Verſe plays looſe, like ſome vaſt main Sail of a Ship, that flags, and flutters heavily upon the Proſpect of a Breeze, but preſently falls back againſt the Maſt, for want of <hi>Wind,</hi> to ſwell it into Energy. It is in Poems ſuch as Theſe, where, as was paintedly expreſs'd by Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> (but might have been <hi>ſtill more ſo,</hi> by his length'ning out his ſecond Verſe to the <hi>Heptameter</hi> Extent juſt mentioned, and hereunder given it by an Addition only of the <hi>two</hi> ſmall Words, in <hi>Roman</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters)</p>

What his learn'd, and Reverend Editor would repreſent, as an Effect of generous Negligence, in a too active Race of Fancy, ſeeming to have been the cool, and moſt deliberate Reſult of wrong Election: we may plainly gather This, from his own Note to the firſt Book of <hi>Davideis</hi>; where he ſpeaks of This ſtrange Line.</p>

               <p>Painting the Image, by the <hi>Sound,</hi> is, queſtionleſs, one of the livelieſt Beauties, of which Verſe is capable. But how far That is done, by <hi>running out of Meaſure,</hi> and admitting plain <hi>Proſe,</hi> as an Ornament in <hi>Poetry,</hi> I leave to be determin'd by the Judgment of the Reader. He will recollect, that <hi>Homer</hi> was, and <hi>Virgil</hi> (in his Imitation) every-where, ambitious of this verbal colouring: but They neither of 'em thought it neceſſary to That End, to <hi>diſarray,</hi> and <hi>proſify</hi> their Numbers. On the contrary, they rais'd, and added to, their Harmony, by a melodious Latitude, that circumſcrib'd, at once, and diſſipated, by Effect of this all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Practice.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Ear indulg'd him in another equally untuneful Practice, which (in Reverence to the never-failing ſtrong Characteriſtic of the Tribe of Imitators) the <hi>Implicites</hi> in <hi>His</hi> Track have All, with devious Diligence, been careful not to ſtart a Step from.

               <p>That noble Writer ſeems to have been ſenſible of the Perplexity, this Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Numbers, now-and-then, muſt throw a Reader into.

               <p>That This Poem is divided into <hi>Twelve</hi> Books, was a Determination of ſo little Conſequence, that 'twere impertinent to offer at a Reaſon for it.

Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> profeſſedly imitated <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his Choice of Twelve Books, to his <hi>Davideis:</hi> tho', I think, he might as juſtly have rejected <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Number, as He (<hi>Virgil</hi>) had rejected <hi>Homer</hi>'s: The Number of whoſe <hi>Books,</hi> too, the <hi>Roman</hi> would, methinks, more <hi>gracefully</hi> have been a Borrower of, than of his <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> and <hi>Incidents.</hi>—Sir <hi>William D'avenant</hi> ſprings quite aſide from this old imitative Road; but into an Extreme, as wrong, tho' oppoſite. He is for neither <hi>Books,</hi> nor <hi>Propoſition, Invocation,</hi> or <hi>Machinery.</hi> Like ſome of thoſe ſtiff-hearted <hi>Puritans,</hi> who dirtied his own Times, and would hear Sermons with their Hats upon their Heads, in Defiance of <hi>Church Ceremony.</hi> He divides his <hi>Gondibert</hi> into <hi>Five Acts,</hi> as if it were a <hi>Tragedy:</hi> and Each Act into <hi>Cantos,</hi> which may hold, he ſays, the Place of <hi>Scenes.</hi>—This Method Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> in a long prefatory Tract, thought worth his Pains to juſtify; but was, I think, Himſelf, the ſole Supporter of his Argument. In Matters left indifferent, the old Way, if not <hi>beſt,</hi> is ſure to be the <hi>modeſteſt.</hi> For my Part, if Diviſion into Twelve Books needs more Reaſon than, becauſe the Subject offer'd Matter, for That Number, I ſhould think it fully juſtified, from the Diviſion of That People,

               <p>This ſtill continuing to be the Light, wherein they ſee That <hi>Hebrew Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 'twill be pulling down one Prop of their political Fabric, to make plain, in Courſe of theſe Reflections, that the Government of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as aſſign'd by GOD, was <hi>not</hi> a Commonwealth, but an <hi>Hereditary Monarchy</hi>: and that All the <hi>Hebrew's</hi> Miſeries, in thoſe ſucceſſive Slaveries they fell into, for three hundred Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were a natural Effect of Factions, and Confuſions, which the <hi>Princes</hi> of their <hi>Tribes</hi> became divided by, upon aſſuming to Themſelves, in their provincial Severalties, a ſecular Direction of the <hi>military</hi> Power, which, in their firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, was the <hi>Sovereign</hi>'s <hi>Prerogative, excluſively</hi>; together with a Right of <hi>Judicatory</hi> in the laſt Appeal on <hi>Civil</hi> Cauſes: only reſerving to the Popular <hi>Aſſent</hi> or <hi>Diſſent</hi> the Election, or Rejection of new Laws, originally to be brought before the <hi>Congregation,</hi> and <hi>enacted</hi> by and with the People's Approbation, and the <hi>Regal Fiat,</hi> of the Sovereign Authority.</p>

               <p>It may merit Recollection, that the <hi>Papal</hi> Claim to an <hi>Infallibility, in</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Spirituals,</hi> has ſometimes made ſuch near Approach to take in <hi>temporal Supremacy conjunctively,</hi> as in no very wide Degree to hold Itſelf remov'd from Proſpect of a <hi>new Theocracy.</hi> And nearer ſtill was That, of the old <hi>Caliph</hi>'s Claim, in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> firſt Outſtart of <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi>

               <p>Sect. II. L. 10.—<hi>Then</hi> GIDEON, <hi>wiſe, and generous Leader, roſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Line begins the PROPOSITION, (and the Progreſs of the Section ſpecifies the ACTION, of the Poem.)—In its Opening, it is <hi>general</hi>—to teach, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Leader nam'd, that the Inſpir'd by Heaven are to apprehend no Danger, from the moſt unequal Oppoſition: all <hi>divided</hi> Power becoming weaker, on Exertion; while <hi>united</hi> moves <hi>direct,</hi> and ſtill grows ſtronger, in That Motion. The Propoſition next deſcends to the <hi>particular:</hi> declaring it to be the <hi>Redemption</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from her Yoke of foreign Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>It is a terrible Duſt, the <hi>Critics</hi> raiſe, in their Diſputes, concerning the beſt Way of opening Propoſitions. Every body agrees, with them, in recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Modeſty:</hi> but <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> too, ſeems not at all unneceſſary.—I can be as unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with <hi>Statius,</hi> as <hi>Boſſu</hi> has been, for his encumb'ring the Propoſition of his <hi>Achilleid</hi> with Declarations, <hi>that his Hero had frighted the Thunderer:</hi> as alſo with his perſonal Boaſts, how nobly He (the Poet) had <hi>exhauſted Inſpiration</hi>; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſo ſung by <hi>Him,</hi> ſhould reverence him, as her <hi>ſecond Founder.</hi> In a juſt Diſlike of This, All Men, of common Senſe, muſt join; but, from Effect of the ſame Senſe, they ought to quit his Cauſe (I mean <hi>Boſſu</hi>'s), when undiſcerningly attach'd to every caſual Choice, of <hi>Homer,</hi> or of <hi>Virgil,</hi> he deduces an Authority to ſtate <hi>Their</hi> Practice, as a not to be diſputed Standard for All <hi>Epic</hi> Plans to follow.</p>
               <p>There is a celebrated <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> which has been too long conſented to, upon this very Subject, of the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and which it is now high Time to weigh, and find too light, even after I confeſs it <hi>Horace</hi>'s. If I have any Notion, what it is he means, He either has meant evidently wrong, or (which 'twere bolder to ſuſpect him guilty of) has <hi>miſ-expreſs'd</hi> his own true Meaning.—hear him, in <hi>Lord Roſcommon.</hi>

               <p>In the firſt Place, I can ſee no Reaſon, why, becauſe One Man has undertaken to deſcribe a War, and prov'd not equal to his Enterprize, Another therefore ſhould be <hi>arrogant,</hi> in but propoſing the ſame Subject. And, as to <hi>Modeſty</hi> of Propoſition, for the want of which the Writer is here treated ill by <hi>Horace,</hi> and accus'd of <hi>Noiſe,</hi> and <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> I am frank enough to dare confeſs, that the <hi>Immodeſty,</hi> if there is Any here, lies too conceal'd for my Diſcernment. Pray, what could any Author, who deſign'd That Subject, have contriv'd to ſay upon it, <hi>leſs,</hi> when he was entering on the Propoſition of it? Where is the too much <hi>Fire</hi> in his Beginning? Smoke in the Progreſs can be nothing to our Purpoſe: why is there more of <hi>Pomp</hi> expreſs'd, or why more Expectation rais'd, from a plain Promiſe to deſcribe the Ruin of <hi>one Town,</hi> and Death of <hi>one Man,</hi> than to ſhew the <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>many Men,</hi> and treat on the Affairs of <hi>many Cities?</hi> If we were not to expect Accounts, of not alone the Things <hi>Ulyſſes ſaw,</hi> but alſo <hi>why</hi> he ſaw them, to what End then did <hi>Homer</hi> promiſe any thing about 'em, in his Propoſition? If we were to entertain That Expectation, certainly our Hopes are higher rais'd by <hi>Homer,</hi> who aſſures us, we ſhall hear of many Cities, and of many Men, than by the <hi>other,</hi> who propos'd to ſet before us but the Ruin of one City, and one Man's Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Narrowneſs</hi> in theſe implicit Reverencers. They underſtand, and follow in their Author's Rear, with a too creeping, and too blind Servility. Who <hi>reads,</hi> and is not <hi>Horace</hi>'s Admirer? and yet, <hi>who</hi> ſhall be afraid of ſaying, He would better have inſtructed us, by ſome intelligible plain Precept, on this Point, of <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> than by Two ill-underſtood, and wide Examples?—To conclude with my own humble Notion of the Matter, He certainly propoſes well, who comprehends within his Propoſition, the Extent of his whole Meaning, and adds nothing further: And <hi>He errs,</hi> as certainly, who, being ſcrupulouſly terrified, by Words without a Reaſon, is kept back by groundleſs Fear of ſaying more, than This or That Man would have ſaid upon the Subject, and ſays <hi>leſs,</hi> than his own Meaning calls for.</p>

               <p>What People theſe <hi>Midianites</hi> were, into what Nations divided, how govern'd, and where ſeated, as alſo who are now their Deſcendents, I ſhall have Occaſion to deſcribe in the next Book. This Race had waſted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for ſeven Years; within the laſt of which, about the Time of Harveſt, the Poem takes Beginning: that ſo, the Unity of Action might be properly maintain'd, in comprehending only their Redemption, without Retroſpect to their Invaſion; which had form'd <hi>Two</hi> different Actions, and deſtroy'd the Regularity, requir'd in <hi>Epic Poetry.</hi> Critics believe they ſee, that for this Reaſon only, <hi>Homer</hi> commenc'd his <hi>Iliad,</hi> in the tenth Year of the Siege, and <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Aeneid</hi> in the laſt Year of the Voyage. No doubt, they had been, elſe, incumber'd by Exceſs of Matter.</p>
               <p>Sect. VII. L. 5.—<hi>To Theſe old</hi> Amalek <hi>her Standards join'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This numerous and mighty Nation will have Place at large, among the Notes of the ſucceeding Book. They were the <hi>Hebrew's firſt</hi> and <hi>ſureſt</hi> Enemies: <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe, <hi>They,</hi> firſt, attack'd 'em, in their March; when they were <hi>beaten,</hi> under <hi>Moſes.</hi>—And <hi>ſureſt,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> receiv'd particular Command from GOD, never to make Peace with the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> but purſue, till they had quite eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. And this, at laſt, they very nearly had accompliſh'd, after many hundred Years were paſt, firſt. What, in this Affair, I find leaſt comprehenſible, is, GOD's remembring, for a People, who Themſelves had long forgot, this Right to Vengeance. They appear to have deſerv'd it very little: it being <hi>after</hi> their <hi>Rejection</hi> of His Care concerning them. I am at ſome Loſs, therefore, to account for the ſurpriſing Rigour of the Curſe denounc'd on <hi>Saul,</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> three hundred and fifty Years after the Injury receiv'd: in Puniſhment of but a generous <hi>Pity,</hi> ſhewn to <hi>Agag,</hi> when his Priſoner. As the Compaſſion was a Virtue, and 'twere hard, to think the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Love of <hi>Vengeance</hi> keener than the <hi>King</hi>'s, the Anger could ariſe but from a Recollection, that ſuch Mercy, ſhewn to <hi>Amalek,</hi> was a Contempt expreſs'd, of <hi>Heaven:</hi> there ſtanding out an un-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd Decree, for total Extirpation of That People.</p>

But That Half Tribe of the <hi>Manaſſans,</hi> which is here alluded to, had their Allotment to the Weſt of <hi>Jordan.</hi> It was a long, but narrow, Slip of Land, which trended, from the River's Brink, 'twixt <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> almoſt to the Sea Coaſt abovemention'd. On a Mountain, toward the Eaſt End of this Slip of Land, in Sight of <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſtood the City of <hi>Ophra (Gideon</hi>'s Birth-place), ſafe from Inſults of an Enemy, by its impregnable Situation. At the Foot of this high Mountain, open'd a large, beautiful, and fruitful Valley, That of <hi>Jezreel</hi>; where the <hi>Midian</hi> Army is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to lie encamp'd at This Time, whence the Poem takes Beginning. This Valley of <hi>Jezreel</hi> has been the Scene of many bloody Battles. It was there, our <hi>Gideon</hi> overthrew the <hi>Midianites, Saul,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines: Achab</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi>; And, in more modern Times, the <hi>Tartars</hi> the <hi>Saracens.</hi>

               <p>That there was a Tree, and a Bench under it, before <hi>Joaſh</hi>'s Houſe, we have the Teſtimony of the Bible, which informs us, that an <hi>Angel of God came, and ſat there:</hi> but, that it was ſo large, and old a Tree, is a poetical Diſcovery.

And no Doubt, It <hi>will be ſo,</hi> by thoſe bold Sons of Liberty, who boaſt the Honour of their Birth within <hi>due Diſtance</hi> of its Shadow. The abovenam'd Gentleman aſſerts, from his own Knowlege, that there is This pleaſant Kind of Privilege annex'd to an old <hi>Oak,</hi> which has, Time out of Memory, been the Glory of <hi>Knoll Wood, near Trely Caſtle,</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire:</hi> The Shade of This Tree's Boughs, he ſays, is very ample; and, in due Reſpect to its Antiquity, whoever will make Oath, on Birth of any Child who muſt call nobody Its Father, that This Child was actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <hi>within any Part of Its Shadow,</hi> the Offence is free, and ſtands exempted from all Cognizance, whether of civil, or eccleſiaſtic Magiſtrate.—But, to return to the Longevity of Trees, undignified by ſo indulg'd a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lawſon,</hi> in his Tract of <hi>Orchards,</hi> has brought reaſonable Arguments to prove, a <hi>Pear</hi>-Tree's Life may be a <hi>thouſand Years.</hi> And truly, if the Age of <hi>Man,</hi> before the Flood, was from Six hundred to Nine hundred Years, it can be no great Raſhneſs to imagine, that an <hi>Oak,</hi> ſo much more durable, and ſolid, in its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not ſubject to the Dangers and Diſeaſes, which diſorder human Bodies, may be capable of living many thouſand Years; the Soil ſuppos'd <hi>adapted,</hi> and no Accident ariſing, that might interrupt, or ſtop its Progreſs.— And thus much I thought it not amiſs to note, in Reference to the Age I have aſſign'd the <hi>Oak of Gideon.</hi>

               <p>The Deſcription, which this Verſe begins, I took ſome Pains to make a pleaſing one; but would not have it thought, I introduc'd it, to make Way for Ornament.—Not but <hi>Deſcription</hi> is the <hi>Life</hi> of Epic Poetry; and it is There (as <hi>Boileau</hi> well obſerves) the Poet ought to laviſh all his Fancy, and his Rhetoric; yet, if it ſerves no other End than mere <hi>Delight,</hi> the Poem will be found to languiſh; for, the Race of <hi>Action</hi> is too coldly ſtopp'd, in Favour of <hi>detach'd Ideas.</hi> BOSSU writes much, to ſay a very little to the Purpoſe, in his Chapter of <hi>Deſcriptions:</hi> Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> is more clear, and hits the Point directly, in one ſhort Remark of his Diſcourſe againſt <hi>Prince Arthur.

               </p>
               <p>It is in this laſt View, that the Deſcription of the Morning, dawning over <hi>Gideon,</hi> ſhadow'd by his Oak, was introduc'd, in order to impreſs a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, not of the Place and Poſture ſimply, but of all the hoſtile Proſpect opening before him, to convey a local Image, and tranſmit the Senſe of Danger, and of his Reflections on it, from the <hi>Hero</hi>'s, to the <hi>Reader</hi>'s, Paſſions, as we ſee in common Life how forcibly Regards of <hi>Place</hi> aſſiſt Imagination.

               <p>The Uſe I make of <hi>Horſe,</hi> in the Progreſſion of this War, being frequent, and conſiderable, I take Occaſion, from their firſt being mention'd, in this Verſe, to aſſert the Uſe of <hi>Cavalry</hi> among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> leſt ſome haſty <hi>Doubt,</hi> perhaps, might cenſure it, as not in Practice, in That early Period. And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Homer,</hi> writing of a War much <hi>later,</hi> makes no Mention in His Work of <hi>Horſemen:</hi> but deſcribes That noble Creature in no other Manner, than as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs'd to the ſkirmiſhing little <hi>Chariots,</hi> of his <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Trojan</hi> Captains.—How this happen'd in the <hi>Iliad</hi> I am not able to account for: tho', that his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were then unſkilful to <hi>back Horſes,</hi> I can eaſily enough believe, becauſe, not long before, they had miſtaken the firſt Horſemen they had ever ſeen for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Creatures, Half-Man Half-Horſe, and given 'em the Name of <hi>Centaurs:</hi> from the Buſineſs they ſeem'd fondeſt of, which was, to ſteal their <hi>Cattle.</hi> But, that ſuch, too, ſhould have been the Caſe among the <hi>Trojans,</hi> muſt not be ſo readily admitted. <hi>Troy</hi> held the Empire, then, of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> and drew power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Allies to her Aſſiſtance, from ſo many diſtant Places, that it is impoſſible to fancy, they were All unſkill'd in <hi>Riding</hi>; when ſo many Ages before That, the Wars all over <hi>Aſia</hi> had been dreadfully diſtinguiſhable for the Number of their <hi>Cavalry —Ninus,</hi> the Founder of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> had enter'd <hi>Bactria</hi> with Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand <hi>Horſe,</hi> beſides his Chariots; which were above a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; <hi>Semiramis,</hi> his Wife, who was the Builder of <hi>Babylon,</hi> invaded <hi>India</hi> (ſays <hi>Suidas</hi>) with a Million of <hi>Horſemen:</hi> and of <hi>Chariots</hi> arm'd with <hi>Scyths</hi> at the End of their Axle trees, above a Hundred thouſand, alſo.</p>
               <p>It may be ſurmis'd, that Horſemen in ſuch Numbers, in thoſe early Ages, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were over-rated by the Inaccuracy of Hiſtorians: Let it be ſo; It has no Force againſt the <hi>Uſe</hi> of Horſe in War, ſo antiently.—If, therefore, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> thus abounded in their Cavalry, It muſt be paſt Diſpute, that bordering Nations alſo had the Uſe of 'em: and cou'd not have come ſo far with Purpoſe to invade

the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> without bringing Numbers, in their Armies.—As for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Themſelves, <hi>Scripture</hi> is full of Inſtances, how early They were able <hi>Horſemen:</hi> and it had been ſtrange, indeed, to find them otherwiſe, when we remember they came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> where the <hi>Pharaohs</hi> were ſo generally powerful, in Arms, and ſo particularly furniſh'd with fine <hi>Cavalry,</hi> that <hi>One</hi> of 'em purſued the <hi>Hebrew</hi> People, in their March to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> with <hi>Fifty thouſand Horſe</hi> (ſays <hi>Joſephus</hi>) and Two hundred thouſand Foot; <hi>beſides</hi> all the <hi>Chariots,</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Antients made great Uſe of <hi>Drums</hi>; though differing, in Shape, and Mode of beating, from the Ways in modern Practice. They were not ſtruck upon by <hi>Sticks</hi>; but with ſtrong Pulſion of the Hands alone, and both at Top and Bottom; being ornamented, round their Rims, with thick-ſet Plates of jingling Braſs.— And certainly, ſuch Drums muſt have deriv'd their Uſe from the moſt early Times; having been found with the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> when firſt diſcover'd by the <hi>Europaeans.</hi> And, for the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> there are ſuch concurring Proofs of its Antiquity, in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> that I was much ſurpriz'd at Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Aſſertion, in his Notes on <hi>Homer,</hi> that it was not yet invented, in the <hi>Trojan War!</hi> That War was in the Time of <hi>Abdon</hi>'s judging <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and Trumpets were ſo long before in Uſe among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the <hi>Ark</hi> was never mov'd, nor any Congregation ſummon'd, but by the Sound of this known Inſtrument. They had a Feſtival, too, call'd the Feaſt of <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</hi> The Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down, at Sound of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s <hi>Trumpets. Gideon</hi> blew a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and All <hi>Abiezer</hi> was gather'd after him. <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the very Wilderneſs, directs the making Silver <hi>Trumpets,</hi> whoſe Shape, and Dimenſions ſuit exactly with Thoſe, now, among us.—How has Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> then form'd this Notion, that they knew no Uſe of Trumpets in the <hi>Trojan</hi> War? Was it, becauſe he found it not in <hi>Homer?</hi> Poſſibly his <hi>Greeks</hi> were, yet, too rude to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Practice in their Armies. Poſſibly they held it too inſpiring, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: as we read, that ſome of their vain Countrymen (the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>) rejected it, long after, as a Stirrer up of Courage: which, it ſeems, they had a mind to repreſent, as naturally over-active, in their Conſtitution.—Therefore, march'd to Battles with the ſoft appeaſing Sound of <hi>Flutes</hi> and <hi>Flagelets,</hi> before 'em: They would induce their Enemies to think, They rather found it needful to correct the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0670901400:79"/>
overboiling of their Ardour, than propel and irritate it. <hi>Virgil,</hi> however, gives <hi>Aeneas</hi> a Trumpeter; and ſays, He had, before, belong'd to <hi>Hector: Virgil,</hi> therefore, thought the Trumpet was of That Antiquity: and, out of all Diſpute, It was of older Origin.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrews,</hi> after <hi>Joſhua</hi> was dead, concluded only a ſlight War, of little Conſequence, in the South Parts of <hi>Judah,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Phinehas</hi>; and then, with one concurrent Lapſe from any further Application to their inſtituted Modes of military Practice under general Attachment to <hi>dependent Regulation,</hi> threw That Care, in a <hi>divided</hi> Truſt, to their provincial Heads of Tribes: who, now, had their allotted <hi>Severalties,</hi> in Territory, and in Civil, and <hi>Palatinate</hi> Pretenſions: and fell in with the whole People's Diſpoſition to improve, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their <hi>Lands</hi>; drinking (as the Text expreſſes this Deſertion of the Public Duty, for the private Intereſt) <hi>Every Man under his own Vine, and</hi> eating <hi>under his own Fig-tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This univerſal Spirit of Defection met too little Oppoſition, from a Want of due Attention in their <hi>prieſtly Sovereigns,</hi> to the <hi>Civil</hi> Branch of their Prerogative, and of the <hi>Military</hi> ſtill more willingly; as from their Turn of Education, leſs adapted to its Duties. They depended on the awful Influence of their divine Pre-eminence, and their Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Ark of God,</hi> whereto lay All Appeals, and to whoſe final Sentence, in the <hi>High Prieſt</hi>'s Voice, the People were injoin'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, and direct, Obedience, under Penalty of <hi>preſent Death, by ſtoning</hi>; ſo, they took no Care to educate ſome martial Genius (ſuch as <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s had been), and to <hi>attach him, by his Intereſt,</hi> to ſole Dependence on the Royal Safety: under whoſe delegated Right to That Supremacy in warlike Exerciſe, the Tribes had been, till then, enur'd, and diſciplin'd, and held unitedly together.</p>
               <p>The Knot had long been looſening; but Love of Eaſe, and Taſte of Luxury, now all at once diſſolv'd it.—Till this fatal Lure, in their detach'd Diviſions of the <hi>Land,</hi> the Want of Property among Particulars ſuſtain'd no other than the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0670901400:80"/>
general Intereſt. Hope of the <hi>future,</hi> from the State's Proſperity, kept every Individual Eaſy in his <hi>preſent</hi> Indigency: The joint Diſtreſs of their collective Body held it cloſe compacted, like a Heap of Pebbles, in a watry Soil, froze hard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: The new Warmth of Self-dependency, diſſolving the Adheſion, Every Off-falling Pebble became a <hi>ſeparate Body,</hi> and contributed no longer to the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Univerſal.</hi> In this diſpers'd Condition, what, before, had been <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,</hi> by virtue of its <hi>Weight,</hi> lay liable, thenceforth, to be trod down by every Hoof; and only magnified its Breadth, to ruin its Conſiſtency.</p>
               <p>Plenty in Eaſe was the firſt Step toward Anarchy: It drew on Diſregard of public Happineſs: The next was Wealth with Luxury; to which ſucceeded Pride; and That, in natural Conſequence, produc'd Contempt of Law; ſoon follow'd by Defiance of Authority. The ſure Reſult of All together was Diſſenſion, and Confuſion.—Turbulent Ambition ſet up Every <hi>Tribe</hi> to wiſh, and act, with views to Independency; and under this relax'd Inſenſibility to National Coherence, the Remainder of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> (whom Avarice, not Mercy, had too indiſcretely ſpar'd) took Arms againſt ſo viſible a Weakneſs; and ſucceeded frequently in their Revolts: till they not only brought this factious People to the loweſt Pitch of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, but taught the Nations, that ſurrounded 'em, to think of, and to treat 'em, with <hi>Contempt:</hi> than which no State can poſſibly be curs'd with an unhappier, or more dangerous, Condition.</p>
               <p>The Progreſs of all This was natural.—It help'd 'em little, that they ſtill had Strength enough, to have repuls'd their Enemies. The <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> like Thoſe in the Old Fable, of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> thought it hard, that they ſhould work to <hi>feed</hi> the <hi>Stomach:</hi> and deſtroy'd themſelves in not ſuſtaining, what they were <hi>ſuſtain'd by.</hi>—While thoſe proud <hi>Hebrews</hi> multiplied their Claims into lean <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, Exemptions,</hi> and <hi>Immunities,</hi> they were pluck'd, One by One, away, like the Hairs of <hi>Sertorius</hi>'s <hi>Horſe-Tail,</hi> which if pull'd at, <hi>All together,</hi> had been found irradicable.—It is in Bodies Politic the ſame, as in a Body Natural: In the Rapidity of ſome wild Race, a Man perceives a gaping <hi>Pit,</hi> before him; what a Happineſs, in ſuch a Caſe, to have the Seat of Counſel, and of Power, the ſame! He ſees the Ruin in the Moment, that he ſhuns it in; for, Reaſon and Authority, concurring in the Head, put preſent Stop to the retracted Members; and they ſtand <hi>ſecur'd,</hi> upon the very Verge of their Precipitation. But, could we here ſuppoſe our Limbs ſtuck over with fine <hi>Mouths</hi> and <hi>Eyes,</hi> like <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Fame, and the imaginary <hi>Argus,</hi> and that every Mouth, and Eye, becauſe it look'd a little like a <hi>Face,</hi> would ſet up for a <hi>Head</hi> too, and lay Claim to Privilege of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; what Conſequence could we expect to ſee, from ſuch a <hi>Popular Balance?</hi> Clamour, more than enough, there could not fail to be, to give <hi>Alarm</hi> to ſuch a Body; but the Monſter's <hi>Neck</hi> would run the Hazard to be <hi>broke,</hi> before each Member could be aſk'd his Sentiment. There could not well be fanſied a more lively Emblem, than, when Reaſoners for Monarchy compare a Commonwealth to That imaginary Serpent, ſome old Writers dreamt of, with ſeven Heads, and but one Tail. The turbulent Reptile would, in ſpite of its big Hiſſing, only

hang itſelf in every Hedge: whereas, with but one Head, It would draw all its ſeven Tails <hi>through,</hi> and find no Danger, or Incumbrance.</p>

This Steel Head was triangular, in Length two Foot, and very ſharply edg'd, and pointed; ſo that the whole Length of the Javelin was about <hi>Six Foot:</hi> It was largeſt, where remoteſt from the Iron (though ſometimes

they are deſcrib'd as double-headed): The poizing Place, for Graſp, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about an Inch and a Quarter in Diameter.</p>
               <p>The Legionary Foot, All, carried this peculiar miſſile Weapon: and could hurl it with ſurpriſing Aim, and Force, againſt an Enemy. The Manner of their caſting it was thus—When the firſt Rank obſerv'd the Diſtance within Reach, they threw their Javelins, point-blank, and ſunk immediately upon one Knee, to give the ſecond Rank uninterrupted Sight, who, then, threw alſo, and knelt down, to give the ſame Advantage to the <hi>Third.</hi> And thus, when <hi>Ten</hi> whole Ranks had thrown ſucceſſively (which was diſpatch'd with an unceaſing Swiftneſs, and Agility), They ſtarted up together, with a general Shout, drew All their Swords at once, and ſo ruſh'd in upon the Enemy.</p>
               <p>What terrible Effects have been produc'd by Javelins, we have innumerable Inſtances in Hiſtory: but none more worthy Notice, than That Great one, at <hi>Pharſalia</hi>; where <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with his uſual Skill, foreſeeing, that <hi>Pompey's Horſe,</hi> compos'd of the moſt warm, and fiery Spirits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth of the Patrician Houſes, would be endeavouring to fall in upon his Rear, on That Wing, where his own few Horſemen were exceedingly out-reach'd, by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, He plac'd, in oblique Line, extending from behind the ſo-expos'd and threatened Flank of Cavalry, ſix choſen Cohorts of his veteran <hi>Foot</hi> (which made about Three thouſand Men) and order'd Theſe, when they receiv'd the Squadrons in their coming round upon 'em, to aim All their Javelins <hi>at the Faces only</hi> of Thoſe gay young Chargers. It ſucceeded, to his Wiſh. The Horſe came furiouſly <hi>about:</hi> but ſtarting unexpectedly on this Reſerve of ſuch experienc'd Wounders, were receiv'd with ſo ſucceſſive Showers of <hi>Javelins,</hi> in their Eyes, Cheeks, Necks, and Foreheads, that unable to ſupport the Horror of ſuch maim'd, and miſerable Faces (for the Horſe had no <hi>Vant-braces</hi> to their Helmets), they All turn'd their Backs precipitately, and diſordering their own <hi>Foot,</hi> loſt <hi>Pompey</hi> that important Day; and gave the World to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

Their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who were the ſole Repoſitories of their Learning, Faith, and Ceremonies, have been cut off, almoſt to a Man, in general and commiſſion'd Maſſacres: and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, which This produc'd, gave Room for Forgeries, and infinite Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, and ſuperſtitious Dreamings, to their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and their <hi>Talmudiſts.</hi> Nor have the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers, to ſay Truth, clear'd more from the Confuſion, than appears to have been added to it. <hi>Joſephus</hi> liv'd at the ſame Time with <hi>Chriſt's Apoſtles,</hi> and is one of our beſt Guides, in Searches of this Nature; but, beſides that he is often not ſo <hi>full,</hi> as might be wiſh'd, his Countrymen had undergone ſo many <hi>Changes</hi> before then, that <hi>Ten</hi> Tribes of the <hi>Twelve</hi> were utterly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated: and the Government, and Cuſtoms of the other <hi>Two,</hi> ſo different, in many of their moſt conſiderable Circumſtances, from the Inſtitutions left by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that for Matters of remote Antiquity we cannot ſafely reſt on <hi>his</hi> Authority. Thus much, however, may be gather'd, from his Teſtimony, and the <hi>Hebrew Model,</hi> as remaining in the Bible, that Each City had a <hi>Senate,</hi> of her <hi>Elders</hi>; that Theſe were generally <hi>Seven,</hi> with a <hi>Levite</hi> on each Hand, for Expoſition of their Law, and to record, as well as regulate, Proceedings.

               <p>Such a Light enlarg'd the Influence of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Virtues. It is not from the Merit of the Truths, he has been recommending, that the Senators derive their Warmth of Admiration. A Man, to whom ſuch Sentiments were natural, would doubtleſs have expreſs'd 'em many Times before, when, yet, they had produc'd no ſuch Effect in Favour of the Speaker. But the Caſe is, now, grown different. It is not to <hi>Gideon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> their Fellow Citizen, and old Acquaintance, they have all this while been liſt'ning. It is to <hi>Gideon</hi> made illuſtrious, by Applauſe and Wonder of the People. What had been common in the MAN, was grown prodigious in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>; and Words, which were, before, thought only worth Neglect, are found, by this new Light, to merit more than Admiration.</p>
               <p>Every Thing we have heard of, Every Thing we admire, will be found, upon Reflection, to have been the Gift of <hi>Opportunity.</hi> Had not <hi>Lucretia's Death</hi> ſucceeded to her <hi>Rape</hi>; or ſome equivalent Excitement rous'd the till-then latent Indignation of the <hi>Roman</hi> People into Tranſport; <hi>Brutus</hi> would ſtill have been conſtrain'd to have <hi>kept on</hi> his Cloak of unexampled Diſſimulation; and the Hiſtory of His Times had wanted one ferocious Inſtance, that Diſguiſe of Paſſions can conſiſt with the moſt ſtern Inflexibility.</p>
               <p>In the ſame City, the ſame Senate, and ſame People, who, while under Hope, or Fear from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Fortune, gave Conſent to all Indignities his Jealouſy could heap on <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and who, with a malignant Lazineſs, ſuppos'd him, in his Abſence, of no longer Conſequence, chang'd Diſpoſition in a Moment, and had, now, no Ear for any Thing but <hi>Caeſar.—Caeſar</hi>'s Valour! <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Goodneſs! <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune!—For they ſaw All This by the <hi>new Light,</hi> his unexpected March to <hi>Rome</hi> had lent 'em.

                  <hi>Baal</hi> was the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Aſhtaroth</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi>; at leaſt, they were moſt generally ſo reputed. But concerning theſe great Eaſtern Idols, and the different Accounts, in Writers, of their Forms, and Modes of Worſhip, much more might be noted,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0670901400:88"/>
than could be of Uſe, or Pleaſure, here.—It will be All the Subject calls for, to obſerve, that they were generally plac'd on <hi>Hills,</hi> with gloomy Groves ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. For they were worſhip'd in the open Air, becauſe it was ſuppos'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous to confine their <hi>Gods</hi> to Temples, who were Omnipreſent, and illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.—Therefore, when the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (as they often did) fell off to the Idolatry of their next-bord'ring Nations, <hi>They made them Images,</hi> ſays Scripture, <hi>and planted Groves about 'em; and ſet up an Idol upon every high Hill, and under every green Tree; after the Abominations of the Kingdoms, which were round about them.</hi>

               <p>From the Aid he here receives from the <hi>Ten Slaves,</hi> whom he had taken in the Cave, and ſaved their Lives, when ſentenc'd by the Senate, there ariſes ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opportunity to ſpeak a Word or two, concerning <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> in general. They never muſt deſerve the Name, which <hi>Horace</hi> gives the independent Parts of ſome of his Cotemporary's Pieces; they are, inſtead of the DISJECTI <hi>membra Poetae,</hi> to be found <hi>attach'd,</hi> as well as beautiful. To heap together a wild Store of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents unlook'd for, and ſurpriſing, will require but the Aſſiſtance of a lively <hi>Fancy.</hi> To chuſe <hi>which</hi> is fit, which not, This is a Buſineſs for the <hi>Judgment.</hi> There was, ſome time ſince, a <hi>Sheep,</hi> with a fine <hi>Top-knot</hi> on its Head: There was a little after, an <hi>Hungarian Girl,</hi> who had a Siſter <hi>growing</hi> to her <hi>Back.</hi> Both Theſe were Objects <hi>unexpected,</hi> and <hi>ſurpriſing</hi>; but they were, however, <hi>Monſters,</hi> and offenſively <hi>unnatural.</hi> They were like the Poems of <hi>Arioſto,</hi> (and I wiſh I could not add, ſome Paſſages in our Great <hi>Spencer</hi>'s) into which a fairy Dance of incoherent light Adventures, of the moſt <hi>Romantic</hi> Model poſſible—if we except the <hi>Tales</hi> in the <hi>Arabian Night's</hi> unmatchable Extravagancies—crouded on, and wedg'd themſelves without Connection, Cauſe, or Conſequence; All, looſe, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0670901400:89"/>
ſeparate, in their Natures, and yet ramm'd together by the Impulſe of the Poet's Spirit. In reading ſuch a Poem, I imagine it like looking down upon a <hi>Sea,</hi> where long Succeſſions of huge Surges after Surges, foaming from all Quarters, without Point of View to reſt upon, move <hi>Horror,</hi> tho', at the ſame time, they ſtrike with a wild Kind of Wonder, ſomething <hi>like</hi> Delight. The Whole amuſes the Attention: nothing leads it, in particular. A regular <hi>Epic</hi> Poet draws along the Mind, as <hi>Rivers</hi> do the Sight: however ſtrong the Current, and the Courſe tho' vaſt and winding, yet the Flow itſelf is orderly, the Force confin'd within its Banks, and if it takes in <hi>Epiſodical</hi> Brooks, it is, to <hi>deepen,</hi> not <hi>divide,</hi> its Chanel.</p>
               <p>Should therefore this Deliverance of the <hi>Slaves</hi> have purpos'd nothing further, than to ſet off <hi>Gideon,</hi> and diſplay his Generoſity, the Contrivance had been flat, and wanted the Characteriſtic of an <hi>Epic Epiſode.</hi> For, while it could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, that It had any Influence toward Advance of the main Action, the Reader would have thought their Hiſtory too inconſiderable to atone for the Digreſſion, they miſled him into. But the Intereſt of theſe honeſt Men becomes intitled to our whole Attention and Concern, as ſoon as we obſerve, that, from their Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, an Action is deriv'd, that gives Foundation to the great one, purpos'd by the Poem: and reflect, that no Men, leſs oblig'd, could have been drawn to a Participation, in ſo menacing a Danger.</p>
               <p>It is probable, in actual Truth, that Theſe ten Servants, who, the Text ſays, aided <hi>Gideon,</hi> in the Night (for Fear of the Inhabitants of <hi>Ophra,</hi> and the Reſt of their own Family), were Perſons, whom He had engag'd to his particular Intereſt, by Effect of ſome uncommon Obligation; It being impoſſible they ſhould not have <hi>foreſeen</hi> the Uproar and Reſentment, which attended their Preſumption: and no Ordinary Temptation had prevail'd on Men of Their expos'd Condition, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke ſo viſible a Hazard.</p>
               <p>It is the ſame again, in That <hi>next Epiſode</hi>; where the Defeat of <hi>Oreb</hi>'s <hi>Party,</hi> and His being made a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> was not introduc'd to give a Proof of <hi>Gideon's Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> but, from Effect of its Exertion, to poſſeſs him of the Public Admiration. I repeat the Obſervation, tho' already noted, to imprint Remembrance of this not to be diſpens'd with Requiſite, in <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> that they <hi>produce,</hi> and make Each other <hi>neceſſary</hi>; and contribute, All, to the <hi>Completion</hi> of the <hi>Epic Action.</hi>
