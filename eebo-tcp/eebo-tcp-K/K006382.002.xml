            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE RIGHT AND CAPACITY OF THE PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE TO JUDGE OF GOVERNMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>From</hi> CATO'S LETTERS.</p>
               <p>HONESTY and plainneſs go together, and the makers and multipliers of myſteries, in the political way, are ſhrewdly to be ſuſpected of dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. <hi>Cincinatus</hi> was taken from the plough to ſave and defend the <hi>Roman</hi> State; an office which he executed honeſtly and ſucceſsfully, without the grimace and gains of a ſtateſman. Nor did he afterwards continue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately at the head of affairs, to form a party, raiſe a fortune, and ſettle himſelf in power: As he came into it with univerſal conſent, he reſigned it with univerſal applauſe.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that government was not in thoſe days become a trade, at leaſt a gainful trade—honeſt <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinatus</hi> was but a farmer: and happy had it been for the <hi>Romans,</hi> if, when they were enſlaved, they could have taken the adminiſtration out of the hands of the emperors, and their refined politicians, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to ſuch farmers, or any farmers. It is certain, that many of their imperial governors acted more ridiculouſly than a board of ploughmen would have done, and more barbarouſly than a club of butchers could have done.</p>
               <p>But ſome have ſaid, <hi>it is not the buſineſs of private men to meddle with government.</hi> A bold, falſe, and diſhoneſt ſaying; and whoever ſay it, either knows not what he ſays, or cares not, or ſlaviſhly ſpeaks the ſenſe of others. It is a cant now almoſt forgot in England, and which never prevailed but when liberty and the conſtitution were attacked, and never can prevail but upon the like occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a vexation to be obliged to anſwer nonſenſe, and confute abſurdities:</hi> but ſince it is and has been the great deſign of this paper to maintain and explain the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0127200302:5"/>glorious principles of liberty, and to expoſe the arts of thoſe who would darken or deſtroy them; I ſhall here particularly ſhew the wickedneſs and ſtupidity or the above ſaying; which is fit to come from no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to the falſhood of the thing: Public truths ought never to be kept ſecrets; and they who do it, are guilty of a ſoleciſm, and a contradiction: Every man ought to know what it concerns all to know.

In this wretched ſituation, the people, to be ſafe, muſt be poor and lewd: there will be but little induſtry, where property is precarious; ſmall honeſty, where virtue is dangerous.</p>
               <p>Profuſeneſs, or frugality, and the like virtues or vices, which affect the public, will be practiſed in the city, if they be practiſed in the court; and in the country, if they be in the city. Even <hi>Nero</hi> (that royal monſter in man's ſhape) was adored by the common herd at <hi>Rome,</hi> as much as he was flattered by the great; and both the little and the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, or pretended to admire his manners, and many to imitate them. <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, that thoſe ſort of people long lamented him, and rejoiced in the choice of a ſucceſſor that reſembled him, even the profligate <hi>Otho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good government does, on the contrary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great virtue, much happineſs, and many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> while they continued free, were each of them, for the number of inhabitants, like one continued city; for virtue, knowledge, and great men, they were the ſtandards of the world; and that age and country that could come neareſt to them, has ever ſince been reckoned the happieſt. Their government, their free government, was the root of all theſe advantages, and of all this felicity and renown; and in theſe great and fortunate ſtates, the people were the principals in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; laws were made by their judgment and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and by their voice and commands were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates made and condemned. The city of <hi>Rome</hi> could conquer the world; nor could the great <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, the greateſt then upon earth, ſtand before the face of one <hi>Greek</hi> City.</p>
               <p>But what are <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> now? <hi>Rome</hi> has in it a herd of pampered monks, and a few ſtarving lay
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0127200302:7"/>inhabitants; the <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the fineſt ſpot of earth in <hi>Europe,</hi> is a deſart. And for the modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> they are a few abject contemptible ſlaves, kept under ignorance, chains, and vileneſs, by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarch, who keeps a great part of the globe intenſely miſerable, that he may ſeem great without being ſo.</p>
               <p>Such is the difference between one government and another, and of ſuch important concernment is the nature and adminiſtration of government to a people. And to ſay that private men have nothing to do with government, is to ſay that private men have nothing to do with their own happineſs and miſery.</p>
               <p>One man, or a few men, have often pretended the public, and meant themſelves, and conſulted their own perſonal intereſt, in inſtances eſſential to its well-being; but the whole people, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting their own intereſt, conſult the public, and act for the public by acting for themſelves: this is particularly the ſpirit of our conſtitution, in which the whole nation is repreſented; and our records afford inſtances, where the houſe of commons have declined entering upon a queſtion of importance, till they had gone into the country, and conſulted their principles, the people: ſo far were they from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that private men had no right to meddle with government. In truth; our whole worldly happineſs and miſery (abating for accidents and diſeaſes) are owing to the order and miſmanagement of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he who ſays that private men have no concern with government, does wiſely and modeſtly tell us, that men have no concern in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them moſt; it is ſaying that people ought not to concern themſelves whether they be naked or clothed, fed or ſtarved. deceived or inſtructed, and whether they be protected or deſtroyed: What non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and ſervitude in a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> nation!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0127200302:8"/>For myſelf, who have thought pretty much on theſe matters, I am of opinion that a whole nation are like to be as much attached to themſelves, as one man or a few men are like to be. who may be many means be detached from the intereſt of a nation. It is certain that one man, and ſeveral men, may be bribed into an intereſt, oppoſite to that of the public; but it is as certain, that a whole country can never find an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for itſelf, and conſequently <hi>a whole country can never be bribed.</hi> It is the eternal intereſt of every nation, that their government ſhould be good; but they who direct it, frequently reaſon a contrary way, and find their own account in plunder and oppreſſion; and while the public voice is pretended to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by one or a few, for vile and private ends, the public knows nothing what is done, till they feel the terrible effects of it.</p>
               <p>By the Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement at the <hi>Revolution,</hi> a right is aſſerted to the people of applying to the King and to the parliament by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and addreſs, for a redreſs of public grievances and miſmanagements, when ſuch there are, of which They are left to judge: and the difference between free and enſlaved countries lies principally here, that in the former, their magiſtrates muſt conſult the voice and intereſt of the people: but in the latter, the private will, intereſt, and pleaſure of the governors, are the ſole end and motives of their adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>Such is the difference between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Turky;</hi> which difference, they who ſay that private men have no right to concern themſelves with government, would abſolutely deſtroy; they would convert ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates into baſhaws, and introduce popery into politics.

               <p>HOW diſguſting is a ſtate of ſociety, when we obſerve men either tearing one another in pieces by violence; or taking every unjuſt means to undermine each other by cunning and treachery, each acts as if his <hi>only</hi> aim were the total extirpation of his ſpecies! how ſhocking the idea! that of all the animals ſcattered over this vaſt globe, man is the moſt ferocious.</p>
               <p>Seldom or never do we ſee the moſt ſavage ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals wage war with thoſe of the ſame kind: that is a refinement in cruelty of which man only is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0127200302:10"/>hurry mankind into all the horrors of deſolating war: ſeeming eager to deſtroy that ſociety they but a few months before, (nay, perhaps but a few days; ſword to be the guardian of.—Theſe ſerious reflections having a few nights ago taken poſſeſſion of my mind before going to ſleep, raiſed in my imagination the following dream.</p>
               <p>Methought I was tranſported to a large plain, green, flowery, and watered with innumerable rivulets; whoſe gentle murmurs formed an agreeable concert with the ſweet notes of ſongſters which flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon their verdant banks.—The inhabitants of this delightful place were divided into a number of different ſocieties; each governed by its own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular monarch.—As I was walking among them, obſerving their manners and cuſtoms, which I found were quite different, notwithſtanding their near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection; between ſome only a ſlight barrier; others had even but ſmall rivulets to fix their boundaries. I was much ſurpriſed to ſee them conſtantly wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and engaged in quarrels; ſometimes for the leaſt trifle; ſuch as the <hi>ducks</hi> of one diſtrict ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a <hi>pool</hi> belonging to another: or perhaps to ſatisfy the fooliſh caprice of ſome of the <hi>great men</hi>—for in each ſociety was a great number who were called <hi>Satellites</hi> of their reſpective crowns; who, as other ſecondary planets derive their luſtre from ſome primary planet, ſo they received their authority from the crown, and diſpenſed it to the people without the leaſt diminution. I was equally ſurpriſed at the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity</hi> of the one, and the <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience of the other. But my wonder ſomewhat abated when I ſaw their different manner of handling a controverſy: the multitude wholly unacquainted with the wiles of logic, had nothing to ſupport their cauſe but a parcel of phraſes and words now entirely obſolete; ſuch as <hi>reaſon, humanity,</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> with a long liſt of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated etceteras: whereas, on the other ſide, the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> and their <hi>jack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and many other ſyllogiſms of the ſame kind. This manner of <hi>perſuaſion,</hi> or rather <hi>compulſion,</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the <hi>logic of tyrants.</hi> Pain they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained was much better for clearing the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than reaſon; the latter actuating but ſlowly, whilſt the other was almoſt inſtantaneous. Having walked a little further, I gained a ſmall ſpot entirely ſurrounded by water: here, thought I, <hi>Peace</hi> muſt have her reſidence; no longer ſhall my ears be grated with the horrid din of war; my eyes ſhall not here behold the tears of the widow, with her children clung round her, bewailing the loſs of a fond huſband and tender father, torn by force from their arms.— But gueſs my aſtoniſhment, at finding them the moſt litigious and quarrelſome party I had yet met with: and though they boaſted of being free, were ſo <hi>only</hi> in idea! I wondered much how they were ſo eaſily duped, ſeeing no force uſed, not ſo much as a threat: they were even ſaid to have the reins of Government in their own hands, and allowed to drive at pleaſure. But their Monarch took a ſafer way of arguing them out of their liberties, though not leſs ſure than that practiſed in the other ſocieties through which I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed—I mean convincing by ready money; or, as ſome call it, <hi>bribing a man to an opinion.</hi> Experience has proved this to be the moſt effectual method. <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the mint</hi> will perſuade much ſooner than thoſe drawn from <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>philoſophy.</hi> Gold is a wonderful clearer of the underſtanding. It ſatisfies every doubt in an inſtant; ſilences the clamorous; ſtops the mouth of the orator; brings over the moſt inflexible ſtateſman; and, in ſhort, is capable of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men out of all their liberties.</p>
               <p>Wiſhing to ſee one of theſe <hi>ſupernatural beings</hi> called <hi>monarchs,</hi> I advanced towards a palace which ſtood at a little diſtance. At the gate was placed a number of guards, cloathed with all the tawdry pomp of power, in order to ſtrike with awe the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0127200302:12"/>beholders. They permitted me to paſs into a large hall, the walls thereof were gilded all for ſhow. At the upper end of the hall was a throne ſupported by magical contrivance upon a few <hi>gothic pillars.</hi> On one pillar I obſerved the word <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> on another <hi>divine right.</hi> Theſe two were in many places nearly mouldered to pieces; ſo that the throne actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tottered, and muſt have fallen, had it not been ſupported by a third pillar of that faſcinating metal called <hi>gold;</hi> whoſe luſtre dazzled the eyes of moſt of the beholders, to ſuch a degree, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to obſerve either the inſcriptions or defects of the other two. The throne was covered with a canopy, which glittered with all the riches which pomp could invent. Under it ſat DESPOTISM, arrayed in all the gorgeous trappings of <hi>arrogance</hi> and <hi>power. Folly</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered around his crown; ambition ſat like a ſpread eagle on the top of his ſcepter; and vanity ſupported the ſkirt of his train. At the foot of the throne ſat <hi>Flattery,</hi> giving her colours and complexions to every thing around: beſide her ſat <hi>Error,</hi> deluding the multitude, and ſtriving to conceal whatever defects might appear. Many other <hi>phantoms</hi> ſtalked round the hall; amongſt whom was <hi>Honour</hi> with nothing on but an old <hi>coat,</hi> the atchievment of ſome of his anceſtors: there was alſo <hi>Oſtentation</hi> holding up his head, and ſtrutting about on tiptoe. Near the prince's right hand ſtood <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> frowning on thoſe who did not bow before him.</p>
               <p>After gratifying my curioſity, and turning to leave the place, I perceived a buſtle at the door, and was not a ittle ſtartled at ſeeing <hi>Broken Credit, Shame, Poverty, Ruin, Scorn,</hi> and many others of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance force their way into the hall, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reſiſtance of the guards. Wondering what would be the conſequence, I ſaw one who was an entire ſtranger here, a grave, decent old man, called PLAIN DEALING, get up and harangue the multitude, in the following terms:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0127200302:13"/>"Citizens.</p>
               <p>"We are oppreſſed, becauſe we have no ſhare in our government. Let us ceaſe to petition for our rights; let us bluſh to bend the knee, and ſupplicate like beggars, for what nature bequeathed to us at our birth. Let us ſpeak in a tone that virtuous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors will hear, and tyrannical ones tremble at. They tell us we have liberty: yes, two or three hundred citizens have the liberty of lording it over all the others; of making and repealing laws at pleaſure; of engroſſing dignities, ranks and honours; of inveſting themſelves with the principal employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſtate, and diſpoſing of the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
               <p>"Can liberty be applied to a people who have no part in the government of themſelves, or their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives? We are no farther free than as we have a ſhare in the adminiſtration, and are a branch of the national council. How intolerable to have inſult added to ſlavery! to be even challenged to prove our wrongs! alas! a taſk but too eaſy. Are not many of our fellow-citizens ſhamefully excluded from all political truſts, by acts which reward falſehood and puniſh honeſty; which uſurp the dominion of that God whom they pretend to revere? Are we not loaded with <hi>taxes</hi> which wring from the poor peaſant great part of his hard-earned pittance, to ſupport fooliſh and profligate wars, entered into with all the madneſs of political <hi>quixotſm;</hi> and which threaten our poſterity with calamities unparalelled in any age?—Is there not an increaſing corruption in the adminiſtration of government? is not the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative houſe of the people become a chamber only for regiſtering miniſterial edicts? has there not been every attempt made to ſilence that guardian of our liberty—the preſs; without which, governors and their minions, might with impunity trample on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, the pretended bulwark of our freedom? is not the equipoiſe in our legiſlature the mere cant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0127200302:14"/>of viſionary theoriſts? In ſhort, is it not a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conſpiracy—a conſpiracy only to be removed by the force of popular opinion? Are theſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ills? Do they ſeem chimerical, on account of that ſecurity into which people ſeem to be lulled— ſome by intereſt, others by ſear?</p>
               <p>"They pretend we have a conſtitution, but nobody knows the mechaniſm of it.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0127200302:18"/>to oppreſs them; and he fancying his will to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly oppoſed, or his due more unjuſtly denied, is filled with a diſlike of what he ſees, and a fear of worſe for the future. Whilſt he endeavours to eaſe himſelf of the one, and to provide againſt the other, he uſually encreaſes the evils of both; and jealouſies are on both ſides multiplied. Every man knows that the governed are in a great meaſure under the power of the governor; but as no man or number of men is willingly ſubject to thoſe that ſeek their ruin, ſuch as fall into ſo great a misfortune, continue no longer under it, than force, fear, or neceſſity may be able to oblige them. But ſuch a neceſſity can hardly be longer upon a great people, than till the evil be fully diſcovered and comprehended, and their virtue, ſtrength, and power be united to expell it: The ill Magiſtrate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end, as ſo many preparatives to his ruin; and by the help of thoſe who are of his party, will endeavour to prevent that union, and diminiſh that ſtrength, virtue, power, and courage, which he knows to be bent againſt him. And as truth, faithful dealing, and integrity of manners are bands of union, and helps to good, he will always, by tricks, artifices, cavils, and all means poſſible, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh falſhood and diſhoneſty; whilſt other emiſſaries and inſtruments of iniquity, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the youth, and ſuch as can be brought to le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This diſtinguiſhes the good from the bad Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, the faithful from the unfaithful; and thoſe that adhere to either, living in the ſame principle, muſt wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

On the other ſide, he that would introduce an ill Magiſtrate, make one evil who was good, or preſerve him in the adminiſtration of injuſtice when he is corrupted, muſt always open the way for him by vitiating the people, corrupting their manners, deſtroying the validity of oaths, teaching ſuch eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, equivocations, and fraud, as are inconſiſtant with the thoughts that become men of virtue and courage; and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other, make it impoſſible for them to unite amongſt themſelves. The like arts muſt be uſed with the Magiſtrate: He cannot be for their turns, till he is perſuaded to believe he has no dependence upon, and owes no duty to the people; that he is of himſelf, and not by their inſtitution: that no man ought to enquire into, nor be judge of his actions; that all obedience is due to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be good or bad, wiſe or fooliſh, a father or an enemy to his country.

They worſhip what they find in the temple, though it be the vileſt of idols; and always like that beſt which is worſt, becauſe it agrees with their inclinations and principles.

Each nation is to itſelf the fleece of Gideon, and drinks excluſively the dew of ſcience; but as God is no reſpecter of perſons, ſo neither is he of nations; he has not, like earthly monarchs, his favourites.—There is a great deal even in our thankſgivings, which is exceptionable on this account; <q>God, we thank thee, that we are not like other nations;</q>—yet we ſurely load, ourſelves with every degree of guilt; but then we like to conſider <hi>ourſelves</hi> as a child that is chidden, and others as outcaſts.</p>

A ſtate, in which it becomes our buſineſs to hurt and annoy our neighbour, by every poſſible means; inſtead of cultivating, to deſtroy; inſtead of building, to pull down; inſtead of peopling, to depopulate; a ſtate, in which we drink the tears, and feed upon the miſery of our fellow-creatures; ſuch a ſtate, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the extremeſt neceſſity to juſtify it; it ought not to be the common and uſual ſtate of ſociety. As both parties cannot be in the right, there is always an equal chance, at leaſt, to either of them of being in the wrong; but as both parties may be to blame, and moſt commonly are, the chance is very great indeed againſt its being entered into from any adequate cauſe; yet war may be ſaid to be, with regard to nations, <hi>the ſin which moſt eaſily beſets them.</hi> We, my friends in common with other nations, have much guilt to repent of from this cauſe, and it ought to make a large part of our humiliation on this day. When we carry our eyes back through the long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of our hiſtory, we ſee wars of plunder, wars,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0127200302:22"/>of conqueſt, wars of religion, wars of pride, wars of ſucceſſion, wars of idle ſpeculation, wars of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt interference and hardly among them a war of neceſſary defence in any of our eſſential or very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intereſts. Of late years indeed we have known none of the calamities of war in our own country but the waſteful expence of it; and ſitting aloof from thoſe circumſtances of perſonal provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which in ſome meaſure might excuſe its fury, we have calmly voted ſlaughter and merchandized deſtruction—ſo much blood and tears for ſo many rupees, or dollars, or ingots. Our wars have been wars of cool calculating intereſt, as free from hatred as love of mankind; the paſſions which ſtir the blood have had no ſhare in them.

When they ſend out their armies to deſolate a country, and deſtroy the fair face of nature, they have the preſumption to hope that the ſovereign of the univerſe will condeſcend to be their auxiliary, and to enter into their petry and deſpicable conteſt. Their prayer, if put into plain language, would run thus: <hi>God of love, Father of all the families of the earth, we are going to tear in places our brethren of mankind, but our ſtrength is not equal to our fury, we beſeech thee to aſſiſt us in the work of ſlaughter. Go out, we pray thee, with our fleets and armies; we call them Chriſtians, and we have interwoven in our banners, and the decorations of our arms, the ſymbols of a ſuffering religion, that we may

               <p>IT is a vulgar proverb, that ſome people are twice children; this is ſometimes the lot of kings, and was the caſe of the ſon of Solomon, the ſon of David. This Prince was forty and one years old when he came to the kingdom, and was a child of a pretty competent age; but notwithſtanding his number of years, his folly ſhewed him to be but a child. It will be neceſſary to illuſtrate this Prince's childhood in a few particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He obſtinately refuſed to redreſs the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his people, and threatened to encreaſe them. Though money was plenty in the days of Solomon, the people were poor; gold and ſilver were plenty in Jeruſalem, and near the king's court, but it does not ſeem to have circulated as far as Shechem, and the extremities of Palaſtine. The real wealth of nations does not conſiſt in a large quantity of ſpecie, but in a proper balance of the value of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with the price of uſeful commodities. Solomon was rich, but his ſubjects were poor and oppreſſed. The misfortune of Solomon's government, for all the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0127200302:25"/>wiſdom that he had, was, that he brought more luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the nation than commodities profitable for the ſervice of the people. He was alſo very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in his houſhold expences, and the charges of his government. <hi>"His proviſion for one day was thirty meaſures of fine flour, and threeſcore meaſures of meal; ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the paſture, and an hundred ſheep, beſides harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowls. He had alſo forty thouſand ſtalls for horſes, for chariots, and twelve thouſand horſemen."</hi> This was a monſtrous peace eſtabliſhment. What a dreadful expence muſt this have been to the nation!</p>
               <p>Under all this ſhew of wealth and ſplendor in the king, the people were poor, and greatly oppreſſed. They therefore came to the new king, to aſk a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of their grievances, and to have their burdens made lighter. But he anſwered them roughly, and would not liſten to their humble petition. <hi>They ſpake unto him, ſaying, Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous ſervice of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter, and we will ſerve thee.</hi> There was nothing unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in all this; it was a very modeſt requeſt, and none, except a <hi>child</hi> or a <hi>fool,</hi> would have refuſed it. Solomon ſeems to have had ſome ſuſpicion of his ſon before he died; for he ſays, <hi>he hated all his labour, becauſe he was to leave it to the man that ſhould come after him, and he knew not whether he would be a wiſe man or a fool.</hi> What his father was afraid of he now ſhewed publicly, in refuſing the requeſt of his people, who promiſed willingly to ſerve him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would enable them to do it when it was in his power. Could any thing be more childiſh than to continue an expenſive government, and an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous civil liſt, when all ranks of perſons were groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under burdens, and complaining of oppreſſion? The complaints of the people are not to be trifled with; for if princes will not relieve them, they will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0127200302:26"/>themſelves, and the Almighty will help them to do it. It was a moſt childiſh action in that weak Prince to refuſe ſuch a reaſonable petition, which was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for his own intereſt to grant; for the people promiſed to ſerve him if he would eaſe them a little; ſo he might have ſaved all by a little condeſcenſion, which he loſt through wilfulneſs and obſtinacy. What can princes imagine the people are made of, when they treat them ſo ridiculouſly? they muſt ſurely think that they are not creatures of like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with themſelves, otherwiſe they would ſoon conclude, that they would not ſuffer the treatment which they often give them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Prince refuſed the advice of his father's aged and wiſe counſellors. <hi>They ſpake unto him ſaying, if thou wilt be a ſervant to this people, and will ſerve them, then they will be thy ſervants for ever.</hi> They deſerved every one a penſion for this advice; but ſuch words of wiſdom ſeldom meet with acceptance or preferment from childiſh princes. Thoſe old ſages knew the office and duty of a king. It is only that of a <hi>public ſervant</hi> to the community, by fulfilling of which, they ſecure the love and obedience of their ſubjects for ever, which is the beſt ſecurity. This wiſe counſel did not ſuit the humour of this <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>childiſh</hi> Prince. The word <hi>ſervant</hi> ſounded harſh in his deſpotic ears—A king to be a ſervant! how uncourtly the thought! how unroyal the idea! thoſe counſellors could not expect to continue long in his Majeſty's ſervice; they were far too honeſt and free in their advice, to ſuit the cabinet of a <hi>childiſh</hi> and <hi>obſtinate</hi> ſovereign. They, however, diſcharged their duty, and gave the beſt proofs of their regard and love to their Prince and their Country. Thoſe old men knew the ſtate of the nation, and were well perſuaded that the people would not long ſuffer the oppreſſions they were groaning under; they underſtood that many things had been now warped into government that were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0127200302:27"/>contrary to the conſtitution of the Kingdom. The law ſaid, <hi>that the King ſhould not multiply horſes, nor make the people return to Egypt for that purpoſe, neither was he to multiply to himſelf ſilver and gola.</hi> Solomon had tranſgreſſed in all theſe reſpects, and more than all, he had been guilty of idolatry, and had not walked in the ſtatutes of God, like David his Father. Theſe were all flagrant breaches of the conſtitution, which the old men knew were unwarrantable, and that the Lord would not ſuffer to paſs unpuniſhed if they were perſiſted in. They alſo knew that the people's claims were juſt and reaſonable, and ought to have been complied with, and for theſe reaſons gave him wholeſome counſel, which a wiſe prince would have received with thankfulneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with honor. But this childiſh Prince was fonder of the gewgaws of majeſty and ſtate, than the dignity of real government; and choſe rather to imitate the <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>follies</hi> of his Father's reign, than covet his wiſdom, wherein he was worthy of imitation.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be more fooliſh and weak, than to violate the fundamental laws of government. It was a fundamental law of the land, that the king ſhould not have his heart lifted up above his brethren; for if this ſhould happen, he nor his children were to prolong their days in the kingdom. Yet this he regarded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but for the ſake of unjuſt dominion, loſt the ten parts out of twelve of his whole dominions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was childiſh, to turn away men of age and experience, and to chuſe young counſellors who knew but little, and were on that account more ready to be raſh and headſtrong. He however ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed with the young men that had grown up with himſelf, who gave him counſel according to his own inclination. Perhaps ſome of them had been his <hi>tutors,</hi> and had taught him thoſe principles of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which they wiſhed to ſee put in practice now when he was come to the throne. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are manifeſt from the advice which they gave
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0127200302:28"/>their ſovereign. <hi>And they ſaid unto him, thus ſhalt thou ſpeak unto this people that ſpeak unto thee ſaying, thy Father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us: thus ſhalt thou ſay unto them, my little finger ſhall be heavier than my Father's loins, and now whereas my Father did lade you with a beavy yoke, I will add is your yoke, my Father did chaſtize you with whips, but I will chaſtize you with ſcorpions,</hi> This ſpeech, like many other ſpeeches that are made for king's, this childiſh Prince was ſo fooliſh as to deliver to the people, which made them change their petition into a remonſtrance, which he did not ſoon forget. <hi>The people anſwered the King and ſaid, what portion have we in David? Neither have we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w ſee to thine own houſe David.</hi> It is the greateſt folly in the world for kings to drive their ſubjects to deſpair; there is none can tell what a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with do when once they are awakened. All fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are alike to them when their own natural rights and privileges are come in competition.</p>
               <p>Whatever reaſons Rehoboam might give for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring theſe raſh counſellors inſtead of the old ſages who gave ſalutary advice, they certainly had their foundation in weakneſs and childiſhneſs. He might probably alledge that he had a right to chuſe his own ſervants and prefer his particular friends; this is a common argument with ſovereigns when they are challenged on this head. But they ought to conſider, that the government of a nation is very different from the government of a houſhold, or the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of domeſtic affairs. Though a king has a right to chuſe his own ſervants, yet thoſe ſervants have no right to ruin a whole nation to pleaſe one man. A prince may appoint whom he pleaſes to manage the affairs of his own houſe, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the nation concerning his conduct; but what relates to the public is quite different; the ſovereign and all his ſervants are accountable to the community
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0127200302:29"/>for the management of public affairs; for there can be no authority with uncontrollable power to ruin mankind, lodged in any department of ſociety.</p>

               <p>WHETHER it would not be very pleaſant to ſee one horſe claiming all the paſture as his, and ordering all the reſt to depart the ſame, unleſs they fulfilled certain conditions which he chuſed to impoſe? and whether to ſee thoſe poor beaſts gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the herbage with unceaſing anxiety and diligence eating only the worſt, but ſacredly refraining from the heſt and bringing it in large bundles with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and diſſidence to the <hi>gentle-horſe,</hi> who receives it with the higheſt air of ſuperiority and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;

               <p>Whether if one of thoſe unfortunate <hi>landleſs</hi> horſes ſhould offer to convince his fellow-ſufferers, that it was the moſt deſpicable ſillineſs, to drudge thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for permiſſion to live on the earth which they had as good a right to as their oppreſſors, and ſhould adviſe them to throw off ſuch ignominious ſervitude; and that, if their aſſuming lords would not give up all thoughts of ſuperiority and tyranny over their fellow-creatures, that they ſhould have their brains kicked out. I fay, whether this poor beaſt could be blamed for ſo doing, or juſtly branded with improper ſelfiſhneſs, levelling, turbulency, ſedition, or other hard names?</p>
               <p>Whether there would not be more reaſon for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſuch as took part with the <hi>gentle</hi> horſes of ſelfiſhneſs, as none certainly would, but from hopes of ſharing in the plunder, or of becoming <hi>gentry</hi> ſometime or other themſelves, and exempted from the labour of cutting their own graſs, whereas the poor levelling horſe could expect nothing from his impartial ſcheme but his bare natural due, which it is the higheſt honour to claim, and prevent all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon?</p>

               </head>
               <p>ONE of the thing which muſt exerciſed my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity after my arrival in Europe, was the Hiſtory and Origin of Republics. Thou knoweſt that generally the <hi>As;iatics</hi> have not ſo much as the leaſt idea of this ſort of government, and that their imagination never extended ſo far as to comprehend, there could poſſibly be any other ſort than the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic throughout the world.</p>
               <p>The firſt governments were monarchical: it was only by chance, and length of time, that republics were formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greece</hi> having been ſwallowed up by a deluge, new inhabitants came to people it: ſhe had almoſt all her Colonies from Egypt, and the neareſt <hi>Aſiatic</hi> countries: and thoſe countries being governed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The love of liberty, and averſion to kings, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Greece</hi> a long time in a ſtate of independence, and very far extended the republican government. The cities of Greece found allies in <hi>Aſia Minor;</hi> they ſent thither colonies as free as themſelves, which were ſo many ramparts againſt the attempts of the kings of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> This was not all: <hi>Greece</hi> peopled <hi>Italy; Italy, Spain,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Gaul.</hi> It is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that the great <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>peria,</hi> ſo famous among the antients, was at the beginning <hi>Greece,</hi> which was looked upon by its neighbours as the ſeat of felicity: the <hi>Greeks</hi> not finding at home that happy country,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0127200302:38"/>went and looked for it in <hi>Italy:</hi> thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Boetica</hi> or <hi>Portugal:</hi> ſo that all theſe regions went by this name among the ancients. Theſe <hi>Greek</hi> Colonies carried along with them a ſpirit of liberty, which they had aſſumed from that kindly climate. And accordingly we ſeldom or never, in thoſe remote times, meet with monarchies in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> or either of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> We ſhall ſee by and by, that the people of the <hi>North</hi> and of <hi>Germany,</hi> were no leſs free than the others; and if there are appearances of any thing like royalty among them, it is becauſe their leaders of armies, or heads of republics, were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for kings.</p>
               <p>All this happened in <hi>Europe:</hi> as for <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> they were ever oppreſſed with deſpotiſm: excepting ſome towns of <hi>Aſia Minor</hi> already taken notice of; and the republic of Carthage in Africa.</p>
               <p>The world was divided between two powerful republics, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage:</hi> nothing is ſo well known as the beginning of the Roman republic, and nothing ſo little known as the origin of that of <hi>Carthage:</hi> we are utterly ignorant of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>African</hi> Princes, after <hi>Dido,</hi> nor do we know by what means they came to loſe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The prodigious increaſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic would have been a great bleſſing to mankind, had there not been that unreaſonable difference between the citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the conquered nations; had they given to the governors of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, a more limited authority; had they paid due regard to thoſe divine laws, made to reſtrain their tyranny; and had they not, in order to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thoſe laws, employed the very treaſures which their rapine and injuſtice, had accumulated together.</p>
               <p>Liberty ſeems to be calculated to the genius of the nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſlavery adapted to tha of the <hi>Aſiatics.</hi> In vain did the <hi>Romans</hi> offer tht
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0127200302:39"/>invaluable treaſure to the <hi>Cappadocians;</hi> that worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nation refuſed it, and courted ſervitude with the ſame ardour as other nations purſued liberty.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Europe</hi> groaned a long time beneath the military and violent government; and the <hi>Roman</hi> mildneſs was changed into a hard-hearted oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Mean while, infinite numbers of unknown na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſwarmed from out the <hi>North:</hi> ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like torrents through all the <hi>Roman</hi> provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and finding it as eaſy a thing to make conqueſts, as to increaſe their piracies, they diſmembered thoſe provinces, and made kingdoms of them. Theſe people were free; and they ſo confined the authority of their kings, that they were properly ſpeaking no more than chieftains, or generals. Thus, thoſe kingdoms, though founded in force, felt not the yoke of a conqueror. When the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Aſia,</hi> namely the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Tartars,</hi> made any conqueſts, they being accuſtomed to the will and pleaſure of one ſingle perſon, thought of nothing more than bringing him new ſubjects, and by the force of arms eſtabliſh his violent authority; but the <hi>Nothern</hi> nations being free in their own country, when they had ſeized the <hi>Roman</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, took care not to beſtow on their chief, too large a power. Nay ſome of them, the <hi>Vandals,</hi> for inſtance, in <hi>Africa.</hi> the Goths in Spain, depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their kings whenever they were diſſatisfied with them: and the others too abridged the authority of the prince a thouſand ways: a great number of lords took ſhare of it with him; a war was never entered into without their conſent; the plunder was divided between the general and the ſoldiers; no taxation in favour of the prince; the laws were made in aſſemblies of the whole nation, ſuch was the fundamental principle of all thoſe ſtates that were formed out of the wrecks of the <hi>Roman</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>

               <p>IF riches were ſo great a bleſſing as they are commonly thought, they would at leaſt have this advantage, to give their owners cheerful hearts and countenances; they would often ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir them up to expreſs their thankfulneſs to God, and diſcover their ſatisfaction to the world. But in fact, the contrary to all this is true. For where are there more cloudy brows, more melancholy hearts, or more ingratitude to their great benefactor, than among thoſe who abound in wealth? And indeed it is natural that it ſhould be ſo, becauſe thoſe men, who covet things that are hard to be got, muſt be hard to pleaſe; whereas a ſmall thing maketh a poor man happy; and great loſſes cannot befal him.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe worth conſidering, how few among the rich have procured their wealth by juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: how many owe their fortunes to the ſins of their parents, how many more to their own? If men's titles were to be tried before a true court of conſcience, where falſe ſwearing, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vile artifices, (that are well known, and can
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0127200302:46"/>hardly be avoided in human courts of juſtice) would avail nothing; how many would be ejected with infamy and diſgrace? how many grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable by breach of truſt, by bribery and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How many have ſold their religion, with the rights and liberties of themſelves and others, for power and employments?</p>
               <p>And it is a miſtake to think, that the moſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſinner, who oweth his poſſeſſion or titles to any ſuch wicked arts of thieving, can have true peace of mind, under the reproaches of a guilty conſcience, and amidſt the cries of ruined widows and orphans.</p>
               <p>I know not one real advantage that the rich have over the poor, except the power of doing good to others: But this is an advantage which God hath not given wicked men the grace to make uſe of. The wealth acquired by evil means, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver employed to good ends: for that would be to divide the kingdom of <hi>Satan</hi> againſt itſelf. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been gained by fraud, avarice, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the like, muſt be preſerved and increaſed by the ſame methods.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add but one thing more upon this head which I hope will convince you, that God (whoſe thoughts are not as our thoughts) never intended riches or power to be neceſſary for the happineſs of mankind in this life; becauſe it is certain, that there is not one ſingle good quality of the mind ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to obtain them, where men are reſolved to be rich at any rate; neither honour, juſtice, temperance, wiſdom, religion, truth, or learning: for a ſlight acquaintance of the world will inform us, that there have been many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men in all ages, who have arrived at great poſſeſſions, and great dignities, by cunning, fraud or flattery, without any of theſe, or any other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rues that can be named. Now if riches and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were ſuch bleſſings, that good men without
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0127200302:47"/>them could have their ſhare of happineſs in this life; how cometh it to paſs, that God ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be often dealt to the worſt and moſt profligate of mankind? that they ſhould be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally procured by the moſt abominable means, and applied to the baſeſt and moſt wicked uſes? This ought not to be conceived of a juſt, a merciſul, a wiſe, and almighty being. We muſt therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that wealth and power are in their own nature, at beſt, but things indifferent, and that a good man may be equally happy without them, provided that he hath a ſufficiency of the common bleſſings of human life, to anſwer all the reaſonable and virtuous demands of nature, which his induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will provide, and ſobriety will prevent his wanting. Agur's prayer, with the reaſons of his wiſh, are full to this purpoſe. <q>Give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me; leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay who is the Lord? Or, leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain.</q>

               </head>
               <p>SACRILEGE we are told by ſome, ſignifies the robbing or ſtealing from God any thing which is peculiarly his. Now nothing can be ſtolen from God, nor can any thing be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him. Every thing being his, it is as much his in the hands of one man as in the hands of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, let who will have the uſe of it, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty cannot be altered: God who has all things, can never be put out of poſſeſſion of any thing, and as nothing can be taken from him, ſo neither can anything be given to him, becauſe all the world and every thing in it is aheady his: and it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0127200302:48"/>to imagine that any form of words, or change of place or poſition, can enlarge or leſſen his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in any thing. All that we have, we have from him: and to return him his own gifts back again, which we want and he does not, is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, nor any part of religion or reaſon: It is ſhewing ourſelves wiſer than he, in ſetting apart for his uſe thoſe things which he has graciouſly created and ſet apart for ours. Can we feed him? or can we cloath, adorn or enrich him? Can we build him a city to dwell in, or furniſh him with guards for the ſecurity of his perſon?</p>
               <p>Sacrilege therefore is either the robbing of men, or no robbery at all. And this crime is greater or leſs, according to the meaſure or miſchief done. To rob a poor man of his loaf, is a greater crime, in <hi>foro conſcientiae,</hi> than to rob a rich man of an Ox: To rob a man of a ſmall part of a thing that is neceſſary to him, is a greater crime, than the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him of a great ſuperfluity; and if I rob a man of a thing that will do him hurt, I hope I do him leſs an injury, than if I robbed him of a thing which does him good. But if I take a thing which no man has a right to, I myſelf have a right to it, by poſſeſſing it.</p>
               <p>To apply all this to the buſineſs of Sacrilege; if a man take away any of the books, veſtments, or utenſils, made uſe of in devotion, he only robs the congregation, who muſt buy more; and many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more able than one to bear the loſs, the offence, as to its effects, is leſs than if he robbed but one man. But if he take away from a Heathen Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, plate, or hidden treaſure, laid up there, but not uſed, he indeed does an action that he has no right to do, but an action that however does good to the world, by turning into uſe, that which was of none, or of bad uſe.</p>

He therefore, whoever he be, that takes it from thence, let him take it in what manner he will, does a better and more public thing, than he who keeps it there.</p>
               <p>No man can be robbed of a thing in which he has no property. Of this ſort was Apollo's wealth; and nobody was robbed in taking it away. So that whoever takes away golden images, or other dead wealth the means and objects of falſe adoration, is guilty of no other crime, than that of diſturbing erroneous conſciences: Nor need ſuch conſciences be much diſturbed, ſince the crime being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without their conſent, they have no ſhare in it.

               <p>I AM ſorry I cannot in all things conform myſelf to the advices of my friends; if theirs had any joint concernment with mine, I would willingly ſubmit my intereſt to theirs, but when I alone am intereſted, and they only adviſe to come over as ſoon as the act of indemnity is paſſed, becauſe they think it is beſt for me, I cannot wholly lay aſide my own judgment and choice. I confeſs we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to delight in our own country, and I have a particular love to mine; I hope I have given ſome teſtimony of it; I think that being exiled from it is a great evil, and would redeem myſelf from it with the loſs of a great deal of my blood: but when that country of mine, which uſed to be eſteemed a paradiſe, is now like to be made a ſtage of injury, the liberty which we hoped to eſtabliſh.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0127200302:51"/>oppreſſed, all manner of profaneneſs, looſeneſs, luxury and lewdneſs ſet up in its height; inſtead of the piety, virtue, ſobriety, and modeſty, which we hoped God, by our hands would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the beſt of our nation made a prey to the worſt, the parliament, court, and army corrupted, the people enſlaved, and all things vendible, and no man ſafe, but by ſuch evil and infamous means as flattery and bribery: what joy can I have in my own country in this condition? Is it a pleaſure to ſee all that I love in the world ſold and deſtroyed? Shall I renounce all my old principles, learn the vile court arts, and make my peace by bribing ſome of them? Shall their corruption and vice be my ſafety? Ah! no, better is a life among ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, than in my country upon ſuch conditions. Whilſt I live, I will endeavour to preſerve my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or at leaſt not conſent to the deſtroying of it, I hope I ſhall die in the ſame principle in which I have lived, and will live no longer than they can preſerve me. I have in my life been guilty of many follies, but as I think of no meanneſs, I will not blot and de file that which is paſt, by endeavouring to provide for the future. I have ever had in my mind, that when God ſhould caſt me into ſuch a condition, as that I cannot ſave my life, but by doing an indecent thing, he ſhews me the time is come wherein I ſhould reſign it. And when I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live in my own country, but by ſuch moans as are worſe than dying in it, I think he ſhews me, I ought to keep myſelf out of it. Let them pleaſe themſelves with making the king glorious, who think a <hi>whole</hi> people may juſtly be ſacrificed for the intereſt and pleaſure of <hi>one</hi> man and a <hi>few</hi> of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: let them rejoice in their ſubtility, who by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former powers have gained the favour of this, not only preſerved but advanced themſelves in theſe dangerous changes. Nevertheleſs (perhaps) they may find the king's glory is their ſhame, his plenty
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0127200302:52"/>the people's miſery: and that the gaining of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or a little money is a <hi>poor</hi> reward for deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a nation! (which if it were preſerved in liberty and virtue, would truly be the moſt glorious in the world) and that others may find they have with much pains purchaſed their own ſhame and miſery, a dear price paid for that which is not worth keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the life that is accompanied with it; the honour of Engliſh Parliaments have ever been in making the nation glorious and happy, not in ſelling and deſtroying the intereſt of it, to ſatisfy the luſts of one man. <hi>Miſerable Nation,</hi> that from ſo great a height of glory is fallen into the moſt deſpicable condition in the world, of having all its good depending upon the breath and will of the vileſt perſons in it! <hi>cheated</hi> and <hi>fold</hi> by them they truſt, <hi>infamous traffick,</hi> equal almoſt in guilt to that of Judas. In all preceding ages Parliaments have been the pillars of our liberty, the ſure defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the oppreſſed: They who formerly could bridle kings, and keep the balance equal between them and the people, are now become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all our oppreſſions, and a ſword in his hand to deſtroy us: They themſelves, led by a few intereſted perſons, who are willing to buy offices, for themſelves by the miſery of the whole nation, and the blood of the moſt worthy and eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in it. Deteſtable bribes, worſe than the oaths now in faſhion in his mercenary court! I mean to owe neither my life nor liberty to any ſuch means, when the innocence of my actions will not protect me, I will ſtay away till the ſtorm be overpaſſed. In ſhort, where <hi>Vane, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Haſlerigg</hi> cannot live in ſafety, I cannot live at all. If I had been in England, I ſhould have expected a lodging with them; or though they may be the firſt, as being more eminent than I, I muſt expect to follow their example in ſuffering, as I have been their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in acting. I am moſt in a maze at the miſtaken
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0127200302:53"/>informations that were ſent to me by my friends; full of expectations of favours, and employments. Who can think that they who impriſon them would employ me, or ſuffer me to live when they are put to death! If I might live and be employed, can it be expected that I ſhould ſerve a government that ſeeks ſuch deteſtable ways of eſtabliſhing itſolf? Ah! no, I have not learned to make my own peace, by <hi>perſecuting</hi> and <hi>betraying</hi> my brethren, more innocent and more worthy than myſelf: I muſt live by <hi>just means,</hi> and ſerve to <hi>just ends,</hi> or <hi>not at all,</hi> after ſuch a manifeſtation of the ways by which it is intended the king ſhall govern, I ſhould have renounced any place of favour into which the kindneſs and induſtry of my friends might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced me, when I found thoſe that were better than I, were only fit to be deſtroyed. I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſome jealouſies, the fraudulent proclamation for indemnity encreaſed the impriſoning of thoſe three men, and turning out of all the officers of the army, contrary to promiſe, confirmed me in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions not to return.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the tide is not to be diverted, nor the oppreſſed delivered; but God in his time, will have mercy on his People; he will ſave and defend them, and avenge the blood of thoſe who ſhall now periſh, upon the heads of thoſe, who in their pride, think nothing is able to oppoſe them. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thoſe whom God ſhall make inſtruments of his juſtice in ſo bleſſed a work. If I can live to ſee that day, I ſhall be ripe for the grave, and able to ſay with joy, Lord! now letteſt thou thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace, &amp;c. (So Sir Arthur Haſlerigg on Oliver's death.) Farewel, my thoughts as to king and ſtate, depending upon their actions. No man ſhall be a more faithful ſervant to him than I,

But <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaw the tyrant's deſign, and his own ſhame; and every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility was a freſh provocation. It was as if a thief
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0127200302:56"/>breaking into a houſe to rob a lady of her jewels, ſpoke thus to her ſon: <hi>Sir, pray permit me, or aſſist me to cut your mother's throat, and ſeize her treaſure and I will generouſly reward you with your life, and lend you one or two of her diamonds to ſparkle in as long as I think fit.</hi> Could ſuch a villainous civility as this engage the ſon, eſpecially a virtuous ſon, to any thing but revenge? And would not the only way that he could take it, be the beſt way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> took from <hi>Brutus</hi> his liberty, and his legal title to his life and his eſtate, and gave him in lieu of it a precarious one during his own arbitrary will and pleaſure. Upon the ſame terms he gave him ſome mercenary employments, as hire for that great man's aſſiſtance to ſupport his tyranny. Could the great and free ſoul of <hi>Brutus</hi> brook this? Could <hi>Brutus</hi> be the inſtrument or confederate of lawleſs juſt? <hi>Brutus</hi> receive wages from an oppreſſor! That great, virtuous, and popular <hi>Brutus:</hi> who, if the common wealth had ſubſiſted, might from his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, birth, abilities, and his excellent worth, have challenged the moſt honourable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous offices in it, without owing thanks to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the injuries done by <hi>Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> were great, heinous, and many: and the favours none. All the mercy ſhewn by <hi>Caeſar</hi> was art and affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pure ſelf-love. He had found in the <hi>Roman</hi> people ſo univerſal a deteſtation of the bloody meaſures of <hi>Marius, Cinna,</hi> and <hi>Sylla.</hi> He ſaw the whole empire ſo reduced and enervated by repeated proſcriptions and maſſacres, that he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t his intereſt to eſtabliſh his new-erected domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by different meaſures; and to reconcile. by a falſe and hypocritical ſhew of clemency, the minds of men, yet bleeding with the late and former wounds, to his uſurpation, that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtructive <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had ſlaughtered millions. and wantonly made havock of human race, had any other ſort of mercy, than the mercy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0127200302:57"/>of policy and deceit, will not be pretended by any man, that knows his and the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> therefore being the moſt reverenced and popular man in <hi>Rome,</hi> it became the craſt of the tyrant to make <hi>Brutus</hi> his friend; it was adding a ſort of ſanctity to a wicked cauſe. Whereas the death of <hi>Brutus</hi> by <hi>Caeſar</hi> would have made <hi>Caeſar</hi> odious and dreadful even amongſt his own follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, that <hi>Brutus</hi> ſubmitted to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and was bound by his own act. Here the allegation is true, but the conſequence falſe. Did not <hi>Brutus</hi> ſubmit to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as innocent men are often forced to ſubmit to the gallies, the wheel, and the gibbet? He ſubmitted as a man robbed and bound, ſubmits to a houſe-breaker, who with a piſtol at his heart, forces from him a diſcovery of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a promiſe not to proſecute him. Such engagements are not only void in themſelves, but aggravate the injuries, by the law of nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as by the poſitive inſtitutions of every country, all promiſes, bonds, or oaths, extorted by dureſs, that is, by unlawful impriſonments or menaces, are not obligatory. It is, on the contrary, a crime to fulfil them; becauſe an acquieſcence in the impoſitions of lawleſs villains, is abetting law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs villains.</p>
               <p>Beſides it was not in the power of <hi>Brutus</hi> to alter his allegiance, which he had already engaged to the Commonwealth, which had done nothing to forfeit the ſame. For how lawful ſoever it be for ſubjects to transfer their obedience to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror in foreign war, when the former civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can no longer protect them; or to a new magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate made by conſent, when the old had forfeited or reſigned: It is ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that they can transfer it to a domeſtic traitor and robbet; who is under the ſame ties and allegiance with themſelves, and by all acts of violence, treaſon,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0127200302:58"/>and uſurpation, extorts a ſubmiſſion from his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed maſters and fellow ſubjects. At leaſt ſuch allegiance can never be re-engaged, whilſt any means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>d to ſucceed a tyrant.

To own that no perſonal conſiderations, not even the higheſt upon earth, could reconcile him to a tyrant; and that he preferred the liberty of the world to the empire of the world!</p>
               <p>The above charges therefore againſt <hi>Brutus,</hi> can hardly come from any but thoſe, who, like the profane and ſlaviſh <hi>Eſau,</hi> would ſell their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for a meſs of pottage, would ſacrifice their duty to their intereſt; and, unconcerned what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the reſt of mankind, would promote ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, if they might but ſhine in its trappings. But an honeſt mind, a mind great and virtuous, ſcorns and hates all ambition, but that of doing good to men, and to <hi>all</hi> men; it deſpiſes momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary riches, and ill-gotten power; it enjoys no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and <hi>hard-hearted</hi> pleaſures, ariſing from the miſeries of others.

               <head>A memorable Letter from Brutus to Cicero.</head>
               <p>I HAVE ſeen by the favour of <hi>Atticus,</hi> that part which concerns me, in your letter to <hi>Octavius.</hi> The affection which you there expreſs for my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the pains which you take for my ſafety, are great; but they give me no new joy. Your kind offices are become as habitual for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as for you to beſtow; and by your daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and actions in my behalf, I have daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of your generous regard for myſelf and my reputation.</p>
               <p>However, all this hinders not but that the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned article of your letters to <hi>Octavius,</hi> pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with as ſenſible a grief as my ſoul is capable of feeling. In thanking him for his ſervices to the republic, you have choſen a ſtile which ſhews ſuch lowneſs and ſubmiſſion, as do but too clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that you have ſtill a maſter; and that the old tyranny, which we thought deſtroyed, is revived in a new tyrant. What ſhall I ſay to you upon this ſad head? I am covered with confuſion for your ſhameful condition, but you have brought it upon yourſelf; and I cannot help ſhewing you to yourſelf in this wretched circumſtance.</p>
               <p>You have petitioned <hi>Octavius</hi> to have mercy upon me, and to ſave my life—In this you intend my good, but ſought my miſery, and a lot worſe than death, by ſaving me from it; ſince there is no kind of death but is more eligible to me, than a life ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Be ſo good to recollect a little the terms of your letter; and having weighed them as you ought, can you deny that they are conceived in the low ſtile of an humble petition from a ſlave to his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lord, from a ſubject to a king? You tell <hi>Octavius</hi> that you have a requeſt to make him, and hope that he will pleaſe to grant it; namely to ſave thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0127200302:60"/>citizens who are eſteemed by men of condition, and beloved by the people of Rome. This is your honourable requeſt; but what if he ſhould not grant it, but refuſe to ſave us? Can we be ſaved by no other expedient; Certainly, deſtruction it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is preferable to life by his favour.</p>
               <p>I am not, however, ſo deſponding, as to imagine that heaven is ſo offended with the <hi>Roman</hi> people, or ſo bent upon their ruin, that you ſhould thus chuſe in your prayers; to apply rather to <hi>Octavius,</hi> than to the immortal Gods, for the preſervation, I do not ſay of the deliverers of the whole earth, but even for the preſervation of the meaneſt <hi>Roman</hi> citizen. This is a high tone to talk in, but I have pleaſure in it: It becomes me to ſhew that <hi>I ſcorn to pray to thoſe whom I ſcorn to fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Has then <hi>Octavius</hi> power to ſave us? and while you thus own him to be a tyrant, can you yet own yourſelf his friend? And while you are mine, can you deſire to ſee me in <hi>Rome</hi> and at the mercy of an uſurper? And yet that this would be my caſe, you avow by imploring from a giddy boy, my permiſſion to return, you have been rendering him a world of thanks, and making him many compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; pray how came they to be due to him, if he yet want to be petitioned for our lives, and if our liberties depend upon his ſufferance? Are we bound to think it a condeſcenſion in <hi>Octavius,</hi> that he chuſes that theſe our petitions ſhould rather be made to him than to <hi>Anthony?</hi> And are not ſuch low ſupplications the proper addreſſes to a tyrant? And yet ſhall we, who boldly deſtroyed one, be ever brought baſely to ſupplicate another? And can we who are the deliverers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, deſcend to aſk what no man ought to have it in his power to give?</p>
               <p>Conſider the mournful effects of that dread and deſpondency of yours, in our public ſtruggle, in which, however, you have too many to keep you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0127200302:61"/>in countenance. <hi>The Commonwealth has been los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, becauſe it was given for loſt.</hi> Hence Caeſar was firſt inſpired with the luſt of dominion; hence <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> not terrified by the doom of the tyrant, pants and hurries on to ſucceed him in his tyranny: and hence this <hi>Octavius,</hi> this green uſurper, is ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſuch a pitch of power, that the chiefs of the commonwealth, and the ſaviours of their country, muſt depend for their breath upon his pleaſure. Yes, we muſt owe our lives to the mercy of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſoftened by the prayers of aged ſenators.</p>
               <p>Alas, we are no longer <hi>Romans!</hi> If we were, the virtuous ſpirit of liberty would have been an ealy over-match for the traiterous attempts of the worſt of all men graſping after tyranny; nor would even <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> the raſh and enterpriſing <hi>Mark Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> have been ſo fond of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s power, as frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſate.</p>
               <p>Remember the important character which you ſuſtain. the great poſt which you have filled. You me a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is not <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill as dear to you as ſhe was? Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is your courage and vigilance leſs? And is not the occaſion greater? Or, could you ſuppreſs great traitors, and yet tolerate great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Recollect what you ought to do, by what you have done. Whence proceeded your enmity to <hi>Anthony?</hi> Was it not that he had an enmity to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, had ſeized violently on the public, aſſumed the diſpoſal of life and death into his own hands, and ſet up for the ſole ſovereign of all men? Were not theſe the reaſons of your enmity and of your advice to combat violence by violence, to kill him rather than ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t to him? All this was well, but why muſt reſiſtance be dropped, when there is a freſh call for reſiſtance? Has your courage ſailed you; or, was it not permitted to <hi>Anthony</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave us, but another may? As if the nature of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0127200302:62"/>were changed by changing names and perſons. No, we do not diſpute about the qualifications of a maſter; we will have <hi>no</hi> maſter.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that we might, under <hi>Anthony,</hi> have had large ſhares with him in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſpotic power; we might have divided its dignities, and ſhone in its trappings. He would have received us graciouſly, and met us half way.</p>
               <p>He knew that either our concurrence or acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence would have confirmed him monarch of <hi>Rome;</hi> and at what price would he not have purchaſed either? But all his arts, all his temptations, all his offers were rejected, liberty was our purpoſe, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue our rule: Our views were honeſt and univer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſal; our country and the cauſe of mankind.</p>
               <p>With <hi>Octavius</hi> himſelf there is ſtill a way open for an accommodation, if we choſe it. As eager as the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi> has made that raw ſtickler for empire, to deſtroy thoſe who deſtroyed <hi>Caeſar;</hi> yet, doubtleſs, he would give us good articles, to gain our conſent to that power to which he aſpires, and to which I fear, he will atrive; alas! what is there to hinder him? While we only attend to the love of life, and the impulſes of ambition, while we can purchaſe poſts and dignities with the price of liberty, and think danger more dreadful than ſlavery; what remains to ſave us?</p>
               <p>What was the end of our killing the tyrant, but to be free from tyranny?—A ridiculous motive, and an empty exploit, if our ſlavery ſurvive him! Oh, who is it that makes liberty his care? Liberty, which ought to be the care of all men, as it is the benefit and bleſſing of all! For myſelf rather than give it up, I will ſtand ſingle in its defence, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe, but with my life, my reſolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in freedom my country which I have ſet free: I have deſtroyed a veteran tyrant; and ſhall I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in a raw youth, his heir, a power to controul the ſenate, ſuperſede the laws, and put chains
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0127200302:63"/>on <hi>Rome?</hi> A power which no perſonal favours nor even the ties of blood could ever ſanctify to me; a power, which I could not bear in <hi>Caeſar;</hi> nor if my father had uſurped it, could I have borne him.</p>
               <p>Your petition to <hi>Octavius</hi> is a confeſſion that we cannot enjoy the liberty of Rome without his leave; and can you dream that other citizens are free, where we could not live free? Beſides, having made your requeſt, how is it to be fulfilled? You beg him to give us our lives; and what if he do? Are we therefore ſafe becauſe we live? Is there any ſafety without liberty; or rather, can we poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live having loſt it, and with it our honour and glory? is there any ſecurity in living at <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> is no longer free? That city, great as it is having no ſecurity of her own, can give me none—No, I will owe mine to my reſolution and my ſword; I cannot enjoy life at the mercy of another; <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s death alone aſcertained my liberty to me, which before was precarious: I ſmote him to be ſafe. This is a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpirit, and whitherſoever I carry it, every place will be <hi>Rome</hi> to me, who am <hi>Roman</hi> enough to prefer every evil to chains and infamy, which to a Roman are the higheſt of all evils. I thought that we had been releaſed from theſe mighty evils, by the death of him who brought them upon us; but it ſeems that we are not; elſe why a ſervile petition to a youth, big with the name and the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for mercy to thoſe patriots, who generouſly revenged their country upon that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and cleared the world of his tyranny? It was not thus in the Commonwealths of <hi>Greece</hi> where the children of tyrants ſuffered equally with their fathers, the puniſhment of tyranny.</p>
               <p>Can I then have any appetite to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> or, can <hi>Rome</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>Rome?</hi> We have ſlain our tyrant, we have reſtored our ancient liberty: But
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0127200302:64"/>they are favours thrown away; ſhe is made free in ſpite of herſelf; and though ſhe has ſeen a great and terrible tyrant bereft of his grandeur and his life, by a few of her citizens; yet baſely deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her own ſtrength, ſhe impotently dreads the name of a dead tyrant, revived in the perſon of a ſtripling.</p>
               <p>No more of your petitions to your young <hi>Caeſar</hi> on my behalf; nor, if you are wiſe, on your own. You have not many years to live; do not be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you over-rate the ſhort remains of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable life, by making prepoſterous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable court to a boy. Take care that by this conduct you do not eclipſe the luſtre of all your glorious actions againſt <hi>Mark Anthony:</hi> Do not turn your glory into reproach, by giving the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious a handle to ſay, that ſelf-love was the ſole motive of your bitterneſs to him; and that, had you not dreaded him, you would not have oppoſed him: And yet will they not ſay this, if they ſee that having declared war againſt <hi>Anthony,</hi> you notwithſtanding have life and liberty at the mercy of <hi>Octavius,</hi> and tolerate in him all the power which the other claimed? They will ſay that you are not againſt having a maſter, only you would not have Anthony for a maſter.</p>
               <p>I will approve of your praiſes given to <hi>Octavius</hi> for his behaviour thus far; it is indeed praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; provided his only intention has been to pull down the tyranny of <hi>Anthony,</hi> without eſtabliſhing a tyranny of his own. But if you are of opinion that <hi>Octavius</hi> is in ſuch a ſituation of power, that it is neceſſary to approach him with humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to ſave our lives and that it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he ſhould be truſted with this power; I can only ſay, that you lift the reward of his merits, far above his merits: I thought that all his ſervices were ſervices done to the republic, but you have conferred upon him that abſolute and imperial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which he pretended to recover to the republic.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0127200302:65"/>If, in your judgment, <hi>Octavius</hi> has earned ſuch laurels and recompences for making war again <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s tyranny, which was only the effects and remains of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s tyranny; to what diſtinctions, to what rewards would you entitle thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated, with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the tyranny of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for which they felt the bleſſings and bounty of the <hi>Roman</hi> people? Has this never entered into your thoughts? Behold here, how effectually the terror of evils to come, extinguiſhes in the minds all impreſſions of benefits received! <hi>Caeſar</hi> is dead, and will never return to ſhackle or frighten the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo he is no more thought of, nor are they who delivered that City from him. But <hi>Anthony</hi> is ſtill alive, and ſtill in arms, and ſtill terrifies; and ſo <hi>Octavius</hi> is adored, who beat <hi>Anthony.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Octavius</hi> is become of ſuch potent conſequence, that from his mouth the <hi>Roman</hi> people muſt expect our doom, the doom of their deliverers! And hence it is too that we (thoſe deliverers) are of ſuch humble conſequence, that he muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated to give us our lives!</p>
               <p>I, as ſaid, have a ſoul, and I have a ſword; and am an enemy to ſuch abject ſupplications; ſo great an enemy, that I deteſt thoſe that uſe them, and am an avowed foe to him that expects them. I ſhall at leaſt be far away from the odious company of ſlaves; and wherever I find liberty, there I will find <hi>Rome.</hi> And for you that ſtay behind, who not ſatiated with many years, and many honours, can behold liberty extinct, and virtue with us, in exile, and yet are not ſick of a wretched and precarious life; I heartily pity you. For myſelf, whoſe ſoul has never ebbed from its conſtant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I ſhall ever be happy in the conſciouſneſs of my virtue; owing nothing to my country, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which I have faithfully diſcharged my duty, I ſhall poſſeſs my mind in peace, and find the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of well-doing in the ſatisfaction of having
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0127200302:66"/>done it. What greater pleaſure does the world afford, than to deſpiſe the ſlippery uncertainties of life, and to value that only which is valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, private virtue, and public liberty; that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which is the bleſſing, and ought to be the birth-right of all mankind?</p>
               <p>But ſtill, I will never ſink with thoſe who are already falling; I will never yield with thoſe who have a mind to ſubmit: I am reſolved to be always firm and independent; I will try all expedients; I will exert my utmoſt proweſs, to baniſh ſervitude and ſet my country entirely free. If fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours me as ſhe ought, the bleſſing and joy will be every man's; but if ſhe fail me, and my beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours be thrown away, yet ſtill I will rejoice ſingle; and ſo far be too hard for fortune. What, in ſhort, can my life be better laid out in, than in continual ſchemes, and repeated efforts, for the common liberty of my country?</p>
               <p>As to your part in this criſis, my dear <hi>Cicero,</hi> it is my ſtrongeſt advice and requeſt to you, not to deſert yourſelf; do not diſtruſt your ability, and your ability will not diſappoint you; believe you can remedy our heavy evils, and you will remedy them. Our miſeries want no increaſe; prevent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by your vigilance, any new acceſſion. Formerly in quality of conſul, you defeated, with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and warmth for liberty, a formidable conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſaved the commonwealth; and what you did then againſt <hi>Cataline,</hi> you do ſtill againſt <hi>Anthony.</hi> Theſe actions of yours have raiſed your reputation high, and ſpread it far; but it will be all tarniſhed or loſt, if you do not continue to ſhew an equal firmneſs upon as great an occaſion; let this render all the parts of your life equal, and ſecure immortality to that glory of yours, which ought to be immortal.</p>
               <p>From thoſe, who, like you, have performed great actions, as great or greater are expected;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0127200302:67"/>by ſhewing that they can ſerve the public, they make themſelves its debtors; and it is apt to exact ſtrict payment, and to uſe them ſeverely, if they do not pay. But from thoſe who have performed no ſuch actions, we expect none. This is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference betwixt the lot of unknown talents, and of thoſe which have been tried; and the condition of the latter is no doubt the harder. Hence it is, that though in making head againſt <hi>Anthony,</hi> you have merited and received great and juſt praiſes, yet you have gained no new admiration: By ſo doing you only continued, like a worthy conſular, the known character of a great and able conſul. But if now at laſt you begin to truckle to one as bad as he; if you abate ever ſo little in that vigour of mind, and that ſteady courage, by which you expelled him from the ſenate, and drove him out of <hi>Rome;</hi> you will never reap another harveſt of glory, whatever you may deſerve; and even your paſt laurels will wither, and your paſt renown be forgot.</p>
               <p>There is nothing great or noble in events, which are the fruit of paſſion or chance. True fame refults only from the ſteady perſeverance of reaſon in the paths and purſuits of virtue. The care, therefore, of the commonwealth, and the defence of her liberties, belong to you above all men, becauſe you have done more than all men for liberty, and the commonwealth. Your great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, your known zeal, your famous actions, with the united call and expectation of all men, are your motives in this great affair; would you have greater?</p>
               <p>You are not therefore to ſupplicate <hi>Octavius</hi> for our ſafety; do a braver thing, owe it to your own magnanimity. Rouſe the <hi>Roman</hi> genius within you; and conſider that this great and free city, which you more than once ſaved, will always be great and fice, provided her people do not want worthy chiefs to reſiſt uſurpation, and exterminate traitors.</p>

               <p>A Certain man having many ſons all bred to a ſeafaring life, was deſirous that they ſhould live together in a juſt, brotherly, and ſocial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that though he wiſhed to encourage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual induſtry, and improvement in abilities, by providing that every one ſhould reap the fruits of the ſame, yet was he determined to form their plan of union in ſuch a manner that none, not even their children, ſhould be ſo depreſſed as to be excluded from the common benefits of their birth-right and of an equal token of the impartial regard of their common parent. Wherefore one day having called his ſons together, he addreſſed them to this effect. <q>My dear boys, my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and conduct towards you, has always been ſuch as to convince you, I was ſtrictly, juſt, and impartial. You were all equally my delight and care in your infancy, you have been equally provided with the means of education, and with every comfort and convenience. I have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0127200302:70"/>ſhewn no partiality to any, as being older or younger, I have been in all reſpects your common parent, and I wiſh you and your children to live together as my common children for ever, for I extend my parental regard to your offspring through every generation—Behold, then, this gallant ſhip, equipt and provided with every thing neceſſary for ſea, her rigging and tackle all of the beſt materials, and admirably adapted to the ocean you have to occupy; amply provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtores and proviſions for a long voyage, and waiting only for intelligent and ſkilful agents to conduct her whitherſoever they will. You my dear boys, are ſuch agents, ſufficiently qualified for the adventurous taſk. <hi>Accept, then my ſons of this my precious gift, but remember, I do not give it to one, or two, or a ſelect few, but to you all, and as many of your poſterity as ſhall ſail therein, as a</hi> COMMON PROPERTY <hi>You ſhall be all</hi> EQUAL OWNERS, <hi>and shall share the profits of every voyage equally among you.</hi> You ſhall chuſe from among yourſelves, one fit to be captain, another to be mate, another carpenter, &amp;c.—Theſe officers ſhall continue in office while you pleaſe, and and when you pleaſe you ſhall change them for others, that your affairs may be conducted in the beſt manner poſſible. At the end of the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or at other ſtated times agreed upon, you ſhall ſettle your accounts; and after paying the captain, the mate, and every other officer and man his wages, according to ſtation and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all bills for upholding wear and tear, proviſions, &amp;c. then the remainder, which is the neat profit of the voyage, and which would been mine had I retained the property of the ſhip in my own hands, is now <hi>your</hi> common property, and muſt be ſhared equally among you all, without reſpect to any office any any one may have held. For as I make you all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0127200302:71"/>equal owners, ſo ſhall you be equal ſharers in the profits of each voyage. You are all equal to me, and you ſhall be all equal in this reſpect to each other. Let not the captain, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the wages of a captain, or any other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who receives the wages of his ſtation, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that his brethren before the maſt, and who receive only the wages of common men, ſhould receive ſhare and ſhare alike with himſelf of the profits.

               <p>Theſe injunctions were received by the young men with inexpreſſible joy. And having wrote them, they were called the conſtitution of their MARINE REPUBLIC, and ſwore to maintain them inviolate to the end of time. They then choſe a captain, and other officers, and proceeded on a trading voyage, and being proſperous they ſhared very conſiderable dividends both at the end of this, and many future voyages.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time, however, it ſo happened that theſe marine republicans were diſſatisfied with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0127200302:72"/>the government of the country, in which they reſided. Wherefore taking all their families and all their effects on board, they ſet ſail for America, where they expected to ſee government adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more agreeably to their notions of equality and equity. But a violent ſtorm ariſing, they were driven far out of their courſe, and at laſt arrived at an uninhabited iſland of a luxurious ſoil, and an agreeable climate. Here they gladly landed after much danger, and their ſhip being ſo damaged as to be no more fit for ſea, they determined to ſettle on the iſland. The ſhip was now broke up, and houſes built with the materials, and preparations were made to cultivate the ſoil, as they muſt now think of living by gardening and agriculture. But they foreſaw that if they did not apply the Marine Conſtitution, given them by their father, to their landed property, they would ſoon experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible inconveniences. They therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the property of the iſland to be the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them all collectively in the ſame manner as the ſhip had been, and that they ought to ſhare the profits thereof in the ſame way. The iſland they named Spenſonia, after the name of the ſhip which their father had given them. They next choſe officers to mark out ſuch portions of land, as every perſon or family deſired to occupy, for which they were to receive for the uſe of the public, a certain rent according to its value. This rent was applied to public uſes, or divided among themſelves as they thought proper, But in order to keep up the remembrance of their rights, they decreed that they ſhould never fail to ſhare at rent-time, an equal dividend though ever ſo ſmall, and though public demands ſhould be ever ſo urgent.</p>
               <p>They now ſpread conſiderably over the country, and houſes and workſhops were built at the public expence. The ſpace inhabited became too exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive for one diſtrict, wherefore they divided it into
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0127200302:73"/>many, and called them pariſhes. As they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, when ſeamen, that every ſucceeding ſhip they ſhould build, and man, ſhould, according to their father's maxim, be the property of the crew, ſo, in conformity therewith, they decreed, that every diſtrict or pariſh which they ſhould people, ſhould be the property of the inhabitants, and the rents and police of the ſame at their diſpoſal. Thus they live in union and equality on land, as their father intended they ſhould do on ſea, and frame and people new pariſhes at the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as he deſigned they ſhould build new ſhips. A national aſſembly or congreſs conſiſting of dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from all the pariſhes, takes care of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concerns, and defrays the expences of ſtate, and matters of common utility, by a pound rate from each pariſh, without any other tax.</p>

               <p>WHEN rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power, and have their paſſions inflamed with diſſipation, they are ready to imagine that the whole community are as fooliſh a themſelves; and for that reaſon endeavour to perſuade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that it is faction to oppoſe their meaſures, and treaſon to maintain their own rights.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they will not miniſter to the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the luſts and appetites of thoſe who want to enſlave them, they are called factious and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious It is impoſſible that reaſon can demand, that government which was inſtituted for the good of ſociety ſhould be made the greateſt evil and the heavieſt curſe. It could never be the intent of the appointment of government, that rulers ſhould have a right to diſpoſe of more than belonged to the right adminiſtration thereof. With regard to oſtentations ſplendor, it adds nothing to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of government as a moral inſtitution; for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0127200302:76"/>there is more true dignity in a magiſtrate executing juſt laws in the home-ſpun manufacture of his own country, than in one ſupporting unrighteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and arbitrary authority, dreſſed in ermine, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> trimmed in gold</p>
               <p>Mankind are not in general ſo ignorant, as to ſuppoſe that pageantry and ſuperſtuity, add dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to government, and they can perceive either the fool or the villain through all the garniſhing and trappings of office. Neither the ſtar nor the garter are ſo able to dazzle their eyes, as to hinder them from perceiving the black ſpots that are underneath them, or, of diſcerning the wolf in ſheep's cloathing. Rulers fondly imagine that the people are not qualified to diſcern the injuſtice of refuſing their reaſonable requeſts, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſport themſelves with their petitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances: but in this they diſplay more their own want of judgment than the people do want of ſenſe and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>It is ſomewhat ſtrange that princes have not learned from experience and obſervation, that all unneceſſary expence and ſplendour in government, are only prognoſtications of the downfall of ſtates and forerunners of their ruin. The Hiſtory of the ſour great Monarchies, may ſerve to inſtruct all future generations of the folly of pageantry, and the unneceſſary expence in the government of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Luxury and diſſipation has generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a define of dominion, and made princes neglect paying a juſt regard to the complaints and grievances of their ſubjects; for they have been for the moſt part, fondeſt of dominion when they were leaſt fit to govern, and near to their downfall.</p>
               <p>It is undoubtedly a woeful thing to a nation, to be obliged to ſupply the extravagances of men, who inſtead of ruling it with wiſdom and juſtice, ſpend the ſubſtance thereof in all the vile arts of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0127200302:77"/>corruption and licentiouſneſs. And what adds to this woe is, that they charge the people with being licentious, after they have taken all the pains in their power to make them ſo.</p>

                     <p>I truſt that my ſentiments on the ſubject of <hi>Parliamentary Reform,</hi> are, in general ſufficiently known, and that, without further aſſurances, I might be <hi>depended upon for giving it every ſupport in my power;</hi> but ſome circumſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nces make me wiſh to ſtate them as briefly as poſſible to the county of Suſſex. They are formed on the <hi>experience of twenty-ſix years,</hi> which, whether in or out of government, has equally convinced me, that the <hi>Reſtoration of a genuine Houſe of Commons,</hi> by a <hi>renovation</hi> of the <hi>Rights of the People,</hi> is the <hi>only eſſential remedy</hi> againſt that <hi>ſyſtem of corruption</hi> which has brought the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſgrace and poverty, and threatens it with the <hi>loſs of liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I take the grievance of the preſent ſtate of election to be its <hi>groſs inequality.</hi> All the electors in Great Britain do not amount to <hi>one-ſixth</hi> part of the whole people, and a ſtill greater inequality ſubſiſts in elections made by that ſixth part; for <hi>one-ſeventh part of them</hi> elect a majority, ſo that <hi>one-forty-ſecond</hi> part of the nation, diſpoſe of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

                     </p>
                     <p>My ideas of reform undoubtedly go to one that ſhall be <hi>complete and general throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> I ſee ſuch fatal conſequences ariſe from the preſent partial and accidental ſtate of election, that I cannot take upon me to propoſe any new mode that partakes of the ſame defects. If we do not differ from the <hi>abettors of corruption</hi> upon the broad principle of equality in election, and the <hi>univerſal right of the people to be repreſented,</hi> and are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for a degree of partiality, more or leſs I fear our ground is not found; if we mean only to ſubſtitute partiality for partiality, and are ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I have thought that a <hi>Parliamentary Reform</hi> has much more ſimple and unerring guides to lead us to our end: I mean the <hi>true principles of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and the <hi>Rights of the People.</hi> If theſe exiſt, I do not conſider myſelf at liberty to ſpeculate upon ſyſtem. I have no choice, but to give to every man his own.</p>
                     <p>How far it is wiſe for thoſe who entirely agree in principle upon the <hi>Rights of Men,</hi> to endeavour to perſuade them that the <hi>recovery of their birth-rights,

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0127200302:87"/>without cancelling and reverſing the law of the univerſe, and unrolling the world into its firſt chaos of confuſion; nor ſhould I ſpeak a ſyllable againſt honours being hereditary, could the valour, religion, and prudence of anceſtors be as eaſily entailed on a line or family, as their honours and riches, could but their gallantry be made hereditary as well as their fortunes? Could they tranſmit their virtues as well as names unto their poſterity, I ſhould willingly become the advocate of ſuch a nobility, and ſuffer my ears to be bored to the poſts of their doors; and rather acknowledge them our perpetual maſters and dictators, than hazard the choice of worſe, upon the doubtful election of the people, with whom the beſt men are not always in greateſt reputation.</p>
               <p>But ſince no choice can be more perilous and unſafe, than the caſual lot of nature, I had rather ſtand to any election, than mere chance; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have oftener known fools the ſons of wiſe men by nature, than of the peoples choice or adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Honour is the crown and reward of virtue; is it not then unſeemly they ſhould wear the badge and livery, that were never admitted within the utmoſt court of her temple, that are the very ſlaves and vaſſals of vice and wickedneſs? I cannot but pay a greater tribute of reſpect and honour in my thoughts, to the worth of ſuch as have raiſed themſelves to a high degree and pitch of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, by the wings of their own merits, than to ſuch as are only borne up by thoſe the credit and reputation of their anceſtors hath bequeathed unto them; wherefore that honour may be a ſpur to valour, and the reward of virtue, let it not be proſtrated to every rich and ſordid miſer, who by abandoning all virtue, hoſpitality and humanity, hath with much oppreſſion and grinding the face of the poor, ſcraped much wealth together; but rather on ſuch as by their valour and prudence,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0127200302:88"/>have brought moſt credit and reputation to the commonwealth: wherefore if the parliament pleaſe out of ſuch to create knights, or make the chiefeſt miniſters of ſtate lords by office, or during life, I ſhould account it no ſoleciſm in a commonwealth, but an ornament thereto.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon I look upon the divine, the lawyer, and hereditary nobility, as ſuch irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable antagoniſts to a free ſtate, is not grounded ſingly on the real prejudice they either have, or are like to receive therefrom; but rather, on what their fears and jealouſies are apt to ſuggeſt upon their apprehenſions, being conſcious that their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſts ſtand in oppoſition to that of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; which could they be content to let go, and wave the advantages an injurious preſcription hath given them over their brethren, their concerns would be equally interwoven and wound up with others in that of a commonwealth; and might find it alike propitious to themſelves with any other of like parts and ingenuity: but ſuch is the evil na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, that to have done an injury, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for future enmity, and rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, than any way compenſate thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for a former diſcourteſy: therefore the beſt and the ſooneſt way to be reconciled to ſuch, is quickly to requite their injury; for meaſuring others thirſt of revenge, by the ſtandard of their own malice, they can never believe any one is friends with them, ſo long as he is in arrears to them for an ill turn: ſo that their fear of revenge breeds diſtance, and that encreaſes alienation and diſaffection, which brings forth farther hoſtility, with encreaſe of injuries. In analogy to which doctrine, the beſt way to give the antagoniſts of the commonwealth eaſe, and its ſelf ſecurity, is, by cauſing their fears to fall upon them, and thereby deliver them from further pain, and the public from its jealouſies and future danger; for it can
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0127200302:89"/>never be expected, they ſhould eſpouſe the intereſt of the public, before they have buried that of their private; that they ſhould embark themſelves in the ſame bottom with that of the commonwealth, ſo long as they have ſo many of their own to look after; till theſe are ſhipwrecked, they will not be much concerned in the ſafety and proſperity of the commonwealth.</p>
               <p>We ſhall never be ſo well united in our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſigns for public good, as when we are become all of one piece, and to have but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt: for it is nothing but the diverſity of intereſts that breaks us in pieces, and crumbles us into ſo many different factions and deſigns; which as it was good policy in our monarchs, ſo but bad prudence in a commonwealth: the intereſt of a prince being to break the ſtrength of his people, that one faction being balanced by another, he may with more eaſe and facility render himſelf maſter of all; according to the advice of the old maxim, <hi>Divide and Rule.</hi> But the ſtrength and glory of a commonwealth is its union. And indeed it had otherwiſe been impoſſible, that ever princes ſhould have been able to have tied up the hands of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and bound the ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon</hi> in cords, and bands of withies, had not their policy like that of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> firſt ſhorn their locks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of their ſtrength, had they not firſt according to the fable of the faggot, looſed their bond of union, by ſtarting many intereſts, and kindling divers animoſities among them, they had never faſtened the cords of ſlavery and bondage on them. The <hi>Philistines</hi> had never ſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> or <hi>Uliſſes</hi> with <hi>Polyphemas,</hi> had they not firſt put out their eyes. Nor had <hi>Princes</hi> ever put a hook into the noſtrils of the Leviathan, or played with the mighty Whale, had they not made uſe of a like ſtratagem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0127200302:90"/>Men complain much, and ſeem to have a great ſenſe of the many factions and diviſions in religion, as they are pleaſed to term them; but how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable are theſe to the grand national or civil factions. I confeſs thoſe of religion may ſometime be made uſe of to palliate, but there are other fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that are the bitter root of all our breaches and diviſions: were there not one intereſt of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, another of the commonalty; one of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, another of the laity; one of the lawyer, another of the countryman; one of the ſoldier, another of the citizen; one of the elder, another of the younger brethren, we might ſoon ſee an end of the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the intereſts that claſh ſo much one againſt another, and make ſuch tumults in the world; and were theſe once cancelled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, the other of Preſbyterian and independent, Quaker and Anabaptiſt, &amp;c. would ſoon vaniſh, or at leaſt, make little noiſe or diſturbance in the world. How happy might all men be, did it pleaſe God they might recover the ſight of their common intereſt, and their ſtrength which conſiſts in union. How eaſily might all the nations of the earth ſhake off the iron yokes the tyranny of princes hath put upon them by this means? and with how great facility might this be done! with how little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and det<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But to proceed, ſince it hath pleaſed God once more to put a price into our hands, and cauſe another opportunity of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our native rights and liberties to dawn upon us, I deſire we may not be as fools, not knowing how to uſe it; but that all ways that are ſafe and honourable may be taken for the ſecuring and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it; and therefore that the builders of our ſtate may be furniſhed with a ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

The ancient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths have been neceſſitated to make uſe ſometimes of violent phyſic, to purge and evacuate the rank humours of the body politic, and ſuch as I would not have preſcribed a chriſtian ſtate, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there may be found out ſuch as are more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

How often hath <hi>Greece,</hi> for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her liberty, ſacrificed that life, by which ſhe hath formerly been preſerved from ruin and deſtruction? Who hath not heard of the unhappy tragedy of that valiant captain, that more than once preſerved the capitol, and ſnatched <hi>Rome,</hi> as a prey, out of the very tecth of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> its barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and at laſt fatal enemies? And how often hath <hi>Greece</hi> rewarded her captains victories with baniſhment, inſtead of triumphs? and that upon the ſingle account of ſome ſmall ſuggeſtion of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0127200302:92"/>or weak argument of too great magnificence or popularity; ſo jealous were thoſe republics of their liberty, that the general of an army durſt not make uſe of a little plate in his houſe, leſt it ſhould cauſe envy, or render him ſuſpected of too much grandeur and ambition, and that he endeavoured to ſupplant the commonwealth, and render himſelf their lord and maſter. Others have been conſtrained to level their palaces with the ground, leſt the ſumptuouſneſs and magnificence of their ſtructure, ſhould become the object of the people's envy and hatred. When theſe things come into my mind, I cannot but wonder any ſhould think it ſo eaſy and facile a thing to erect a commonwealth, as that it may be done with a wet finger, and requires no more then inſerting, <hi>the keepers of the liberties,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the name <hi>king,</hi> and that then the work is finiſhed, without any farther trouble or alteration, as may ſeem to be of opinion. I confeſs, had we not at ſo dear a rate bought experience to inform us of the contrary, this miſtake might have paſt for venial, but that makes it an unpardonable error.</p>

               <p>HARD indeed muſt be the heart which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected with the preſent diſtreſs experienced by the Poor in general in this commercial nation. Thouſands of honeſt and induſtrious people in Great Britain, are literally ſtarving for want of bread; and the cauſe invariably aſſigned is a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant commerce. My opinion on this ſubject will perhaps appear to ſome a ſtrange phenomena—it is, that a ſtagnant commerce is not the real cauſe of the want of the neceſſaries of life among the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious poor. And I am confident, that while the "Earth yields her increaſe," there is a method founded on JUSTICE and REASON, to prevent the poor from wanting bread, be the ſtate of trade whatever it may.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, then, I will aſk, What are the principle ſources of human ſubſiſtence? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Corn and Graſs Corn is moulded into many ſhapes for the uſe of man, but chiefly into bread, which is the ſtaff of life; and from graſs, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive our fleſh, milk, butter, cheeſe, &amp;c. beſides wool and leather, which, I think, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of coal, and a few other minerals, nearly make up the real neceſſaries of life.</p>
               <p>I aſk again, then, who is ſo infatuated as to ſay,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0127200302:99"/>that the growing of corn or graſs, is dependant on, or connected with the proſperity or adverſity of trade? Certainly (thank Heaven!) they are not affected by the devouring ſword, or ruined com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce (except at the ſeat of war).—Corn grows not in the loom, nor Graſs upon the anvil! Why is it then, that while there is plenty of bread the poor are ſtarving? Is there not as much grain and graſs in the land as when the trade flouriſhed? Suppoſe trade were to riſe immediately to an amazing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, would it make one grain of corn or blade of graſs more? Certainly not. Why then, I aſk again, are the poor, who are the peculiar care of HIM who delights to do his needy creatures good, not ſatisfied with the good of the land?</p>
               <p>The following reaſons are at leaſt ſatisfactory to myſelf:—Becauſe, in the time of national proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, houſe and land rent (conſequently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are always raiſed by the wealthy and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, till they are, at leaſt at par with high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but, when WAR, or any other cauſe has ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or impeded commerce, and reduced wages, <hi>rents</hi> and <hi>proviſions</hi> remain unabated, The poor calico weavers in the vicinity of Mancheſter, notoriouſly illuſtrate this argument, as they are now (they who can get any) working for fifty and ſixty per cent. leſs wages than at this time two years back, and the neceſſaries of life are rather agumented in their prices than diminiſhed!!!</p>
               <p>Hearken, O ye poor of the Land! While great men have an unbounded power to raiſe <hi>their</hi> rents and <hi>your</hi> proviſions—and, at the ſame time, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled power to make <hi>War,</hi> and conſequently to dry up, or diminiſh, the ſcources of your income, your ſubſiſtance will, at the beſt, be precarious, and your very exiſtence often miſerable!—The preſent want of Bread and Butcher's Meat amongſt the Poor, is not owing to the want of Grain of Graſs in the world, nor, I preſume, in this Land
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0127200302:100"/>but owing to the price of it being exceſſively above the price of labour. When, therefore, the price of labour cannot be brought up to the rate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, proviſions ſhould be reduced to the rate of labour. Till this is practicable, the poor are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable!</p>
               <p>During the laſt twenty years, mechanical wages have been varied according to circumſtances, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and not unuſually, in ſome branches, twenty, thirty, forty, and even fifty per cent.— I mean on the lowering, as well as the riſing ſide of the medium. But, with regard to <hi>land-rent,</hi> its variations have always been progreſſive: and to find a ſingle inſtance to the contrary, would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not altogether, impoſſible!</p>
               <p>It requires but little ſagacity to ſee, that the game laws, riot act, laws againſt vagrants and felons, &amp;c. &amp;c, are made chiefly for the ſecurity of the <hi>rich</hi> againſt the depredations of the <hi>poor.</hi> But what ſecurity have the <hi>poor</hi> againſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and extortion of the <hi>rich?</hi> Certainly none at all. As every comfort of life is derived from land, and as the rich are the proprietors thereof, it may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid, that they hold the iſſues of life and death; and, whilſt they can, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly, raiſe their rents without limitation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, they have an alarming and unbounded power over, not only the happineſs, but even the <hi>lives</hi> of the great maſs of the people—the <hi>poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then, ſtateſmen have a right to advance their lands in times of proſperity, the <hi>poor</hi> ought to have a parliament of their <hi>own chuſing,</hi> inveſted with power to reduce them in days of adverſity. This balance of power between the <hi>rich</hi> and the <hi>poor,</hi> would be productive of a thouſand times more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to this nation, than the chimerical non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of court-jugglers, <hi>"the balance of power in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope."</hi> Nor can I imagine that any judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would call ſuch a power in parliament unjuſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0127200302:101"/>or irrational, which when exerciſed, could rum none, but bleſs millions! if it would be cruel to make a ſtateſman of twenty thouſand pounds per annum, live a year or two upon ten thouſand pounds; how much more remorſeleſs is it, to make the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talfield and Norwich weavers, as well as ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſands more, live upon nothing—or, what is little better upon <hi>charity!!!</hi> Beſides, it is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth, that the very ſuperfluities which ruin hundreds of the voluptuous great, would render happy the innumerable unhappy part of mankind.</p>
               <p>GREAT GOD! What ſpectacle ſo affecting to a reflecting mind as Great Britain in her preſent ſtate!—On the one hand, we ſee the impudent nobles advertiſing their <hi>"grand dinners,"</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>AN AMERICAN ANECDOTE.</p>
                     <p>An Indian, who lately came to one of the American ſettlements to barter away his furs, had beads and other ſmall trinkets deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, wrapt up in pieces of Engliſh newſpapers. Curious to know what was going on in this country, he aſked a trader WHO COULD READ, to explain the contents. The firſt para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph was—"Yeſterday his majeſty, aceompanied by Lord C. and Lord W. and ſeveral other noblemen and gentlemen, took the diverſion of hunting." The next, "The Windſor hunt was laſt week moſt numerouſly attended;"—this was followed by "The Dutcheſs of Gordon's SUPERB dinner, attended by all the cabinet miniſters, except three, who had unfortunately SPLEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DID dinners at their own houſes, the ſame evening; but for theſe gentlemen, her grace has declared her intention of having a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificient feaſt next week." The next paragraph was dated from Yorkſhire, and gave a long account of Colonel Thornton's hounds having run a fox more than 50 miles. The reader was going on with the relation of ſeveral other dinners for LORDS and COMMONS, when the Indian interrupting him, cried out, "Stop, let me hear no more—I ſee that in what you call a civilized country, and boaſt ſo much about, the whole buſineſs of life is the ſame as with us—HUNTING and FEASTING."</p>
                  </note> in the very face of the hungry poor, whom they have ruined!! On the other hand, widows, orphans, and others, are weeping, and often dying for want of bread! What can be more odious in the ſight of Heaven, than feaſt and famine in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0127200302:102"/>Yet this is literally, the caſe in this kingdom at this moment, and not only in the nation, but in every town, in every ſtreet, yea, often under the ſame roof!</p>
               <p>Open your eyes. O ye poor of the land! in vain are your hands and your mouths open!—Do you not ſee how you are cajoled and degraded, by the paltry ſubſcriptions made for you at different times and in various parts of the nation; which ſerve only to make your ſlavery more ſervile, and baſe and your miſery of longer duration? I revere generous ſubſcribers and collectors, but I ſcorn the means! Ye poor, take a farther look into your rights, and you will ſee, that, upon the principles of reaſon and juſtice, every peaceable and uſeful perſon has a right, yea, a <hi>"divine right"</hi> to be ſatisfied with the good of the land! † Beſides, is it not monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoking to be robbed by wholeſale, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by retail! Look again, and you will ſee that public collections, ſubſcriptions and charities, are nothing more than the appendages of corruption, extortion, and oppreſſion! If the benevolent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the univerſe did not ſend amongſt mankind proviſions enough, and more than enough and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over, ſuch is the waſte of the great and the gluttonous, that many of you poor, would get none at all! Say not, therefore, ye oppreſſed, <hi>"there is a famine, or ſcarcety of proviſions in this land!"</hi> It would be falſe.

                  </gap>f proviſions were (as they ought to be) reduced to your wages, you would enjoy your unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able right; a comfortable ſufficiency.</p>
               <p>But, beſides the deſtruction of your trade, and the means of ſubſiſtence, you have the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſee your bread eaten by dragoon and hunting horſes, ſpaniels, &amp;c. and your parental, affectionate, loving, provident and tender guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, can give you a good reaſon why—it is their own!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0127200302:103"/>Hearken! O ye poor of the land! Do you fret and whine at oppreſſion—"yes,"—"Then, as ye do, ſo did your fathers before you"—and, if you <hi>do no more,</hi> your children may whine after you! Awake!

               <p>A ſole legiſlator, proceeding according to art or knowledge, produces government in the whole piece at once and in perfection.

               <p>ENGLAND produces every article neceſſary for the ſupport of mankind; and might, by proper cultivation extended, produce treble the quantity, The lower claſs of the people reap very little benefit from profuſion, becauſe every device is made uſe of to enhance the value of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities requiſite for their ſubſiſtence. Methinks, one half of the inhabitants of this kingdom are dying of hunger and concomitant miſery, while the other half, from wallowing in abundance, are dying of indigeſtion. The ſpirit of gaming has ſo diffuſed itſelf through every rank, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman riſks his thouſands on the out of a card, or the turn of a die; the tradeſman ventures his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds on the riſe and fall of ſtocks; whilſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic and ſervant loſe their guineas on the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a lottery ticket. Hence the penſioned peer, the bankrupt tradeſman, and the crowded priſons.</p>
               <p>Our trading juſtices, our pettifoggers, and our affidavit men, are the locuſts which conſume our property and deſtroy our peace. We have been king-ridden, and prieſt-ridden, but what is much worſe than either, we are at this enlightened age, as is termed, law-ridden, by a ſet of as honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

If the laws are made for the good and obſervance of the ſubject, why are they not brought within the compaſs of common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and given to him to guide his moral conduct? For, how can a man, injuſtice, be held amenable to laws, fabricated by men, with whom he has no intercourſe, and from whom he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot receive any information? And why ought he to be puniſhed for the violation of a law, with which he was never made previouſly acquainted? 'Tis true, there are certain plain rules laid down for man's conduct, in his walks through life; and theſe he may learn by reading his catechiſm; we will there find that the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue compriſes the duty we owe to God and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and I will venture to affirm that a few comments, <hi>if neceſſary,</hi> on each command, would be quite ſufficient for the regulation of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal

               <p>THE magiſtrate ought to do juſtice between citizen and citizen: every nation ought to do the ſame between themſelves and another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This ſecond diſtribution of juſtice requires no maxim but what are uſed in the firſt.</p>

                  </gap>ider, whether the perſon we declare war againſt, is worthy of death. For to make war upon any one is to ſeek to puniſh him with death.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſevere act of juſtice in the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is war; its end being the deſtruction of ſociety,</p>
               <p>Repriſals are of the ſecond degree. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the penalty to the crime, is a method which no tribunal could ever help obſerving.</p>
               <p>A third act of juſtice is to deprive a prince of the advantages he reaps from our commerce, ſtill meaſuring the puniſhment by the offence.</p>
               <p>The fourth act of juſtice, which ought to be the moſt frequent, is a renunciation of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of the people againſt whom we have cauſe of complaint. This penalty is anſwerable to that of baniſhment in common tribunals, which cuts off the criminal from ſociety. So a prince whoſe alliance we renounce, is thereby cut off from our ſociety, and is no longer one of our members.</p>
               <p>There can be no greater affront done to a prince than to renounce his alliance, and no greater honour than to court it. There is nothing among
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0127200302:115"/>men more glorious nor more uſeful, than to have others concerned as watchful for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>But in order to make an alliance binding it muſt be juſt: ſo that an alliance made between two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to oppreſs a third, is not lawful, and may honourably and innocently be broke.</p>
               <p>Neither does it become the dignity and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a prince to enter into an alliance with a tyrant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. We read that a certain Egyptian monarch ſent to reprehend the king of <hi>Samos</hi> for his cruelty and tyranny, calling upon him to amend: and upon his not doing it, he gave him to know that he renounced his friendſhip and alliance.</p>
               <p>The right of conqueſt is no right at all. A ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety can never be founded upon any thing but the free conſent of all the members: if it is deſtroyed by conqueſt, the people are thereby freed from their old engagements: it does not make a new ſociety; and if the conqueror goes about to do it, he acts the tyrant.</p>
               <p>As to treaties of peace, they are never lawful when they ordain a ceſſion or reparation more conſiderable than the damage done: this is mere violence, and may at any time be lawfully ſet aſide; unleſs in order to recover what we have loſt, we are obliged to have recourſe to ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent methods as will create miſchiefs greater than the advantage ſought after.</p>

               <p>MOST of the governments in <hi>Europe</hi> are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchic; or rather called ſo: for I know not whether there were ever any ſuch in reality: at leaſt it is impoſſible they ſhould ſubſiſt long: it is a ſtate of violence, and always fall into a deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical government, or into a republic: the power can never be equally divided between the prince and the people: the equilibrium is too difficult to preſerve: the power muſt diminiſh on one ſide, while it encreaſes on the other; but the advantage generally happens on the ſide of the prince, who is at the head of the armies.</p>
               <p>And accordingly the power of the <hi>European</hi> kings is very great, and one may venture to ſay,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0127200302:117"/>as great as they pleaſe to make it: but they do not ſtretch it ſo far as our ſultans: firſt, becauſe they would not ſhock the manners and religion of their ſubjects. Secondly, becauſe it is not their intereſt to carry it ſo far.</p>
               <p>Nothing brings down a prince ſo near to the condition of his ſubjects, as exerciſing an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant power over them: nothing expoſes them ſo much to the turns and caprices of fortune.</p>
               <p>The cuſtom they uſe of cauſing all that offend them to be put to death upon the leaſt ſignal, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the proportion which ought to be kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the faults and the puniſhments, which is in a manner the ſoul of a ſtate, and the harmony of an empire; and this proportion being ſcrupulouſly obſerved by the chriſtian princes, gives them an infinite advantage above our ſultans.</p>
               <p>A Perſian who, either by imprudence or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, has drawn upon himſelf the diſpleaſure of his prince, is ſure of death: the leaſt fault or the leaſt caprice brings him into this caſe. But if he had attempted the life of his ſovereign; if he had gone about to betray his ſtrong towns to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he could ſtill but loſe his life: therefore he runs no greater riſk in this laſt caſe than in the firſt.</p>
               <p>So that upon the leaſt diſpleaſure finding death unavoidable, and having nothing worſe to fear, he is naturally inclined to diſturb the peace of the ſtate and to conſpire againſt his ſovereign; this being the only refuge he has left.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo with the great men in Europe, who loſe nothing by being diſgraced, but the good-will and favour of their prince: they retire from court and think of nothing but enjoying a quiet life, and the advantages of their birth. As they ſeldom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their lives but for high treaſon, they are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of being drawn into it, conſidering how much they have to loſe, and how little to gain; which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0127200302:118"/>is the reaſon that here we ſeldom ſee rebellions, or kings deſtroyed by violent deaths.</p>
               <p>If in the unlimited authority our princes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, they did not uſe ſo many precautions to guard their lives, they would none of them live a day; and if they did not keep in pay an infinite number of troops to tyrannize over the reſt of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, their empire would not ſubſiſt a month.</p>

               <p>SUCH were the words of that great good man, loſt with thoſe of many others of his time, and his fame, as far as power could hurt it, put in the ſhade along with them. The conſequences we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0127200302:119"/>have all ſeen and felt; America, from an obedient affectionate colony, became an independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and two millions of people, nurſed in the very lap of our monarchy, became the willing ſubjects of a republican conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in that great and calamitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine fought in the ſame field of reaſon together, but with very different ſucceſſes. Mr. Burke ſpoke to a parliament in England, ſuch as Sir George Saville deſcribes it, that had no ears but for ſounds that flattered its corruptions. Mr. Paine, on the other hand, ſpoke TO A PEOPLE; reaſoned with them, that they were bound by no ſubjection to any ſovereignty, further than their own benefits connected them; and by theſe powerful arguments prepared the minds of the American people for that GLORIOUS, JUST, and HAPPY revolution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have a right to diſtinguiſh it by that appellation, becauſe I aver that at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is as ſacred a regard to property; as inviolable a ſecurity to all the rights of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; lower taxes! fewer grievances; leſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, and more to admire, in the conſtitution of America, than that of any other country under heaven. I wiſh indeed to except our own, but I cannot even do that till it ſhall be purged of thoſe abuſes, which, though they obſcure and deform the ſurface, have not as yet <hi>(thank God)</hi> deſtroyed the vital parts.</p>
               <p>Why then is Mr. Paine to be calumniated, and reviled, becauſe out of a people conſiſting of near three millions, he alone did not remain attached in opinion to a monarchy. Remember, that all the blood which was ſhed in America, and to which he was for years a melancholy and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant witneſs, was ſhed by the authority of the crown of Great Britain, under the influence of its parliament, ſuch as Sir George Saville has
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0127200302:120"/>deſcribed it, and ſuch as Mr. Burke himſelf will be called upon by and by in more glowing colours to paint it. How then can it be wondered at, that Mr. Paine ſhould return to this country in his heart a republican? Was he not equally repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican when he wrote common ſenſe? yet that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume has been ſold without reſtraint or proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every ſhop in England ever ſince, and which nevertheleſs <hi>(I appeal to the book, which I have in court, and which is in every body's hands)</hi> contains every one principle of government, and every abuſe in the Britiſh conſtitution, which is to be ſound in the Rights of Man. Yet Mr. Burke himſelf ſaw no reaſon to be alarmed at its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor to cry down its contents, even when America, which was ſwayed by it, was in arms againſt the crown of Great Britain. You ſhall hear his opinion of it, in his letter to the ſheriffs of Briſtol, page 33 and 34.</p>

                     </gap>ingenuous compilation, and ſtrange medley of railing and flattery, was adduced, as a proof of the united ſentiments of the people of Great Britain, there was a great change throughout all America. The tide of popular affection, which had ſtill ſet to wards the parent country, began immediately to turn, and to ſlow with great rapidity in a contrary courſe. Far from concealing theſe wild declarations of enmity, <hi>the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence,</hi> inſiſts largely on the multitude and the ſpirit of theſe addreſſes; and draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he ſuppoſes) muſt be irreſiſtible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of government ſo partial to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as not to allow, that the hoſtile mind of the rulers to their people, did fully juſtify
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0127200302:121"/>a change of government; nor can any reaſon whatever be given, why one people ſhould vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a ſuppoſition of great affection and benevolence towards them. Unfortunately for rulers, truſting to other things, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this great principle of connexion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a time it ſeems for all things.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the conſequences of this mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution are too notorious to require illuſtration. No audience would ſit to hear (what every body has ſeen and felt,) the independence of America notoriouſly produced, not by remote and circuitous effect, but directly and palpably, the revolutions that now agitate Europe, and which portend ſuch new changes over the face of the earth. Let governors take warning. The revolution in France was the conſequence of her incurably corrupt and profligate government. God forbid that I ſhould be thought to lean, by this declaration, upon her unfortunate monarch, bending, perhaps at this moment, under affliction which my heart ſinks within me to think of; but, when I ſpeak with deteſtation of the former politics of the French court, I faſten as little of them upon that fallen and unhappy prince, as I impute to our gracious ſovereign the corruptions of our own government. I deſire, indeed, in the moſt diſintereſted manner, to be underſtood that I mean to ſpeak of his majeſty, not only with that obedience and duty which I owe to him as a ſubject, but with that juſtice which I think is due to him from all men who examine his conduct either in public or private life.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Paine happened to be in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land when the French revolution took place, and notwithſtanding what he may be ſuppoſed and allowed from his hiſtory to have felt upon ſuch a ſubject, he continued wholly ſilent and inactive. The people of this country too appeared to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0127200302:122"/>ſpectators of the animating ſcene. They ſaw, without viſible emotion, deſpotiſm deſtroyed, and the king of France, by his own conſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the firſt magiſtrate of a free people. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, at leaſt, it produced none of thoſe effects which are ſo deprecated by government at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; nor, moſt probably, ever would, if it had not occurred to the celebrated perſon, whoſe name I muſt ſo often mention, voluntarily to provoke the ſubject; a ſubject which, if dangerous to be diſcuſſed, he ſhould not have led to the diſcuſſion; for, ſurely, it is not to be endured, that any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man is to publiſh a creed for a whole nation: to tell us that we are not to think for ourſelves— to impoſe his own fetters upon the human mind— to dogmatize at diſcretion—and that no man ſhall ſit down to anſwer him without being guilty of a libel!!! I aſſert, that if it be a libel to miſtake our conſtitution—to ſupport it by means that tend to deſtroy it—and to chooſe the moſt dangerous ſeaſon for the interference, Mr. Burke is that libeller; but not therefore the object of a criminal proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, whilſt I am defending the motives of one man, I have neither right nor diſpoſition to criminate the motives of another. All I contend for, is a fact that cannot be controverted, viz. that this officious interference was the origin of Mr. Paine's book. I put my cauſe upon its being the origin of it—the avowed origin—as will abundantly appear from the introduction and preface to both parts, and throughout the whole body of the work; nay, from the very work of Mr. Burke himſelf, to which both of them are anſwers.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, for the hiſtory of that celebrated work, I appeal to itſelf.</p>
               <p>When the French revolution had arrived at ſome of its early ſtages, a few, and but a few, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (not to be named when compared with the nation) took a viſible intereſt in theſe mighty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0127200302:123"/>events; and intereſt well becoming Engliſhmen. They ſaw a pernicious ſyſtem of government, which had led to cruel deſolating wars, and had been for ages the ſcourge of Great Britain, giving way to a ſyſtem which ſeemed to promiſe harmony and peace amongſt the nations. They ſaw this with virtuous and peaceable ſatisfaction: And a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend divine [Dr. Price] eminent for his eloquence, recollecting that the iſſues of life are in the hands of God, ſaw no profaneneſs in mixing the ſubject with public thankſgiving; reminding the people of this country of their own glorious deliverance in former ages. It happened, alſo, that a ſociety of gentlemen, France being then a neutral nation, and her own monarch <hi>ſwearing almoſt daily upon her altars to maintain the new conſtitution,</hi> thought they infringed no law by ſending a general congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their numbers, indeed, were very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, ſo much ſo, that Mr. Burke, with more truth than wiſdom, begins his volume with a ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſm upon their inſignificance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Until very lately he had never heard of ſuch a club. It certainly never occupied a moment of his thoughts; nor, he believed, thoſe of any perſon out of their own ſet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Why then make theſe proceedings the ſubject of alarm throughout England?—There had been no proſecution againſt them, nor any charge founded upon ſuſpicion of diſaffection againſt any of their body. But Mr. Burke thought it was reſerved for his eloquence to whip theſe curs of faction to their kennel. How he has ſucceeded, I appeal to all that has happened ſince the introduction of his ſchiſm in the Britiſh empire, by giving to the king, whoſe title was queſtioned by no man, a title which it is his majeſty's moſt ſolemn intereſt to diſclaim.</p>
               <p>After having in his firſt work, laſhed Dr. Price in a ſtrain of eloquent irony for conſidering the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0127200302:124"/>monarchy to be elective, which he could not but know Dr. Price, in the literal ſenſe of election, neither did or could poſſibly conſider it. Mr. Burke publiſhed a ſecond treatiſe, in which, after reprinting many paſſages from Mr. Paine's former work, he ridicules and denies the ſuppoſed right of the people to change their government, in the following words:</p>
               <p>"The French revolution, <hi>ſay they,</hi>" (ſpeaking of the Engliſh ſocieties) <q>was the act of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, <hi>the people of England, for inſtance,</hi> wiſh to make the ſame change, they have the ſame right; juſt the ſame undoubtedly; that is, none at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then, after ſpeaking of the ſubſerviency of will to duty, (in which I agree with him,) he, in a ſubſtantive ſentence, maintains the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The conſtitution of a country being once ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon ſome compact, tacit or expreſſed, there is no power exiſting of force to alter it, without the breach of the covenant, or the conſent of all the parties. Such is the nature of a contract.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that if reaſon, or even Revelation itſelf, were now to demonſtrate to us, that our conſtitution was miſchievous in its effects; that, to uſe Mr. Attorney-General's expreſſion, we had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanes for the many centuries we have ſupported it; yet that ſtill, if the king had not forfeited his title to the crown, nor the lords their privileges, the univerſal voice of the whole people of England could not build up a new government upon a legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate baſis.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, not to argue for the preſent againſt ſuch a propoſition, and ſuppoſing it could, beyond all controverſy, be maintained; for heaven's ſake, let wiſdom never utter it! If you ſeek the ſtability of the Engliſh government, rather put the book
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0127200302:125"/>of Mr. Paine which calls it bad, into every hand in the kingdom, than doctrines which bid human nature rebel even againſt that which is the beſt.— Say to the people of England, look at your conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, there it lies before you—the work of your pious fathers, handed down as a ſacred depoſit from generation to generation, the reſult of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue, and its parts cemented together with kindred blood. There are indeed a few ſpots upon its ſurface; but the ſame principle which reared the ſtructure will bruſh them all away; you may keep it, or you may deſtroy it.—To ſuch an addreſs, what would be the anſwer? A chorus of the nation.—<hi>Yes, we will preſerve it.</hi> But ſay to the ſame nation, even of the very ſame conſtitution, it is yours, ſuch as it is, for better or for worſe; it is ſtrapped upon your backs, to carry it as beaſts of burthen, and you have no juriſdiction to caſt it off. Let this be your poſition, and you inſtantly raiſe up (I appeal to every man's conſciouſneſs of his own nature) a ſpirit of uneaſineſs and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Yet it is the controverſy alone, which this uſeleſs and miſchievous propoſition ſtirred up, that has pointed moſt of the paſſages arraigned before you, which it will be preſently my duty to explain.</p>
               <p>But let the prudence of the argument be what it may, the argument itſelf is untenable.</p>

               <head>ON THE UTILITY OF POLITICAL SOCIETIES.</head>
               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>[From Cooper's Reply to Burke.]</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS outcry againſt the exiſtence and mutual correſpondence of political ſocieties, foreign and domeſtic, is no ſlight argument of their utility. It amounts to proof that this means of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating knowledge to the public, is likely to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with beneficial effects to the beſt intereſts of mankind, or it would not be an object of ſo much alarm to the penſioned advocates of ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. The people now ſee the great importance of political enquiries, and extenſive influence of the maxims of government; which operate directly or indirectly on every moment of our exiſtence, and every action of our lives. They perceive much to learn, and much to unlearn on the queſtion of civil government; they expect as their right, a free acceſs to all peaceable means of information, and exclaim with reaſon, <q>we will be kept in the trammels of implicit belief no longer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>However plain and ſimple the true principles of government may be, when diveſted of that garb of complication and myſtery in which ſtate-craft has enveloped them, it is certain that they are not yet fully ſettled among thoſe who profeſs to write, and reaſon on the ſubject. The beſt political writers of the preſent day, among the Engliſh and French, are not agreed on points of conſiderable moment; and Mr. Burke himſelf has taken no ſmall pains to magnify the difficulties attending a branch of knowledge, of which, he dreads while he promotes the public diſcuſſion. Difficulties there are; ſuch as ignorance and artifice have created; but if they exiſt, (of whatever kind they may be) why throw obſtacles in the way of enquiry, and deny the means of removing them? At any rate, Mr. Burke, whoſe time for two years paſt, has been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0127200302:131"/>chiefly occupied in publiſhing diſcourſes of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical myſticiſin, ought to be the laſt to cry out againſt any ſource of information on a ſubject which he has laboured ſo indefatigably to obſcure. —Equally aware, that public ignorance is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of courts, and public information the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the people, the patriotic ſocieties of France and England, profeſs the ſame general principles of equal liberty, and have preciſely the ſame <hi>general</hi> object in view, viz. the improvement and propagation of political knowledge. In France, as is natural, they diſcuſs the temporary occurrences of their own country; we, thoſe of ours; but the ſame ſcience and the ſame principles are equally applicable to both. Theſe ſocieties, in each kingdom, entertaining therefore the ſame general deſign of extending the bounds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on the moſt important of all ſubjects of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, can it be deemed improper or unbecoming, that they ſhould mutually communicate for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon purpoſe? Is there any impropriety in the <hi>philoſephical</hi> ſocieties of London, Paris, or Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm, correſponding for the improvement of che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, or experimental philoſophy? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, do they not all court correſpondencies, as the moſt effectual means of diffuſing information? Why then ſhould ſocieties inſtituted for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>political</hi> knowledge, be debarred from the common means of improvement? If it be a crime to enlighten the people upon the ſubject of politics, why do not our adverſaries ſay ſo at once, and take that ground of accuſation: if it be no crime, why deny the common methods of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication permitted and adopted in every other branch of human ſcience.</p>
               <p>But after all, why this anxiety among the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of Europe (our own among the reſt) to ſtop the progreſs of knowledge, and cut off the ſources of political information? Why this dread
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0127200302:132"/>leſt the people (the <hi>ſwiniſh multitude,</hi> as their friend, Mr. Burke, calls them) ſhould think too much, and reaſon too much on their own rights, and their own intereſts; leſt the deep veil of myſtery, which ſtate-craft has thrown over the ſcience of government, ſhould perchance be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and the tranſactions of court-polities be expoſed to public obſervation? If the foundations of theſe gaudy ſuperſtructures be unſound, this conduct is eaſily explained: but if governments do actually mean well, if their principles and actions will bear examination, why this general dread of inveſtigation? Why give room to ſuſpect that "Men love darkneſs rather than light—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deeds are evil."</p>

               <p>The author of a pamphlet called, "Peace and Reform," charges our divines, with recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending a conduct equally ſanguinary with the French; and infers there from, that French prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of liberty are no more to be condemned on account of the exceſſes committed by a part of that nation, than the Britiſh conſtitution is to be condemned on account of the exceſſes recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from the pulpit. The following is the paſſage we allude to:</p>
               <p>THE faſt-day, inſtead of being paſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with its profeſſed purpoſe, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0127200302:133"/>before God, in prayers for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of unbelievers, the reformation of ourſelves, and the general peace and happineſs of mankind; inſtead of a day on which every prieſt made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exertion of his powers in imploring the benevolence of the Almighty to enlighten the minds, to ſoften the hearts, and to ſpare the blood of his people, it was chiefly celebrated by the moſt dreadful maledictions. The Supreme Being, who, true religion tells us, enjoins brotherly love, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, humanity and virtue, was addreſſed by our Divines as if he had been more mercileſs and blood-thirſty than any divinity that ever diſgraced Paganiſm; and the temples of the God of Peace were made to reſound with imprecations, from which even our anceſtors would have recoiled when engaged in the worſhip of their ſerocious Odin, whom they revered as <q>the terrible and ſevere God; the active roaring Deity; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſlaughter; the God that carrieth deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and fire, and nameth thoſe that are to be flain.<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Edda.</note>

               <p>The ſolemnity of the ſcene was well calculated for rouſing and miſleading the paſſions, and every artifice was employed to excite hatred towards the French, and provoke us to fury. The prieſthood, as well as the princes, felt themſelves intereſted in the cauſe, and their zeal ſhook the pulpit with exhortations to vengeance. The biſhop of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, before the houſe of lords, thus ſpoke of that nation:— <q>Infatuated and remorſeleſs peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!

               <p>
                  <q>And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid, ſuppoſe ye theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</q>

               <p>The other Faſt Day Sermons were in uniſon with that of the biſhop of Glouceſter, with a very few exceptions. The Rev. J. Gardener, at Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſaid, <q>Shall we not labour to bring ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (as the French, and reformers in general) to a proper ſenſe of their duty, <hi>or exterminate them and their opinions?</hi>
                  </q> and the Rev.

               </p>
               <p>Similar paſſages from the ſermons preached on that chriſtian day would fill a volume. Moſt of them tend to inflame the people to a war of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and inſinuate the deſtruction of thoſe who deſire a parliamentary reform. Surely our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines cannot be ſo much miſtaken as to imagine theſe harangues gratifying to the head of the church? Their affection towards the crown, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is natural. The biſhop of Durham's promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has taught them the road to preferment; and my lord of Glouceſter has been long looking for a tranſlation: but not ſuch as Elijah's: His preſent ambition looks no higher than Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Nor were the ſermons publicly preached more inflammatory than the writings anonymouſly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by our high church men: one of which, in Birmingham, under the fictitious name of Job Nott, thus ſpeaks of thoſe whom it calls <q>New-faſhioned, reſtleſs diſſenters,</q> and the members of a ſociety inſtituted on the principles of Mr. Pitt and the duke of Richmond for procuring a reform of parliament, <q>Do be off; only think of the New Drop; you may be recorded in the New-gate

Yet the author of this elegant book calls himſelf a friend to conciliation and unanimity, a moderate man, a man of peace! He may be ſo for a Birming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham man; but if ſuch are the friends to peace and moderation in that town, can we wonder at the atrocities, which have taken place there, and ſtill may be repeated, while Job Nott, and ſuch publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are publicly ſold with a bookſeller's name to them, and are even boaſted of by their authors.</p>

               <p>IF kings were exhibited ſimply as they are in themſelves to the inſpection of mankind, the ſalutary prejudice, as it has been called, which teaches us to venerate them, would ſpeedily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; it has therefore been found neceſſary to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them with luxury and expence. Thus are luxury and expence made the ſtandard of honour, and of conſequence the topics of anxiety and envy, However fatal this ſentiment may be to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and happineſs of mankind, it is one of thoſe illuſions which monarchical government is eager to cheriſh. In reality, the firſt principle of virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feeling, as has been elſewhere ſaid, is the love of independence. He that would be juſt muſt before all things eſtimate the objects about him at their true value. But the principle in regal ſtates has been to think your father the wiſeſt of men becauſe he is your father, and your king the foremoſt of his ſpecies becauſe he is a king. The ſtandard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual merit is no longer the man but his title. To be drawn in a coach of ſtate by eight milk-white horſes is the higheſt of all human claims to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

If no ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent paſs through his mind, it is a proof that the corrupt inſtitutions of ſociety have already diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of all ſenſe of juſtice.

That the well being of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires men to be treated otherwiſe than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their intrinſic merit? Whether he be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this anſwer or no, will he not aſpire to poſſeſs that (which in this inſtance is wealth) to which the policy of mankind has annexed ſuch high diſtinction? Is it not indiſpenſible, that, before he believes in the rectitude of this inſtitution, his original feelings of right and wrong ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverſed? If it be indiſpenſible, then let the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of the monarchical ſyſtem ingenouſly declare, that, according to that ſyſtem, the intereſt of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in the firſt inſtance requires the total ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of moral truth and juſtice.</p>
               <p>With this view let us again recollect the maxim adopted in monarchical countries, "that the king never dies." Thus with true oriental extravagance we ſalute this imbecil mortal, "O king, live for ever." Why do we this? Becauſe upon his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the exiſtence of the ſtate depends. In his name the courts of law are opened. If his political capacity be ſuſpended for a moment, the centre to which all public buſineſs is linked, is deſtroyed. In ſuch countries every thing is uniform: the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is all, and the ſubſtance nothing. In the riots in the year 1780, the mace of the houſe of lords was propoſed to be ſent into the paſſages by the terror of its appearance to quiet the confuſion; but it was obſerved that, if the mace ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>doly detained by the rioters, the whole would be thrown into anarchy. Buſineſs would be at a ſtand, their inſignia, and with their inſignia their legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and deliberative functions be gone. Who can
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0127200302:140"/>expect firmneſs and energy in a country, where every thing is made to depend not upon juſtice, public intereſt and reaſon, but upon a piece of gilded wood? What conſcious dignity and virtue can there be among a people, who, if deprived of the imaginary guidance of one vulgar mortal, are taught to believe that their faculties are benumbed, and all their joints unſtrung.</p>
               <p>The evils that ariſe out of avarice, an inordinate admiration of wealth, and an intemperate purſuit of it, are ſo obvious, that they have conſtituted a perpetual topic of lamentation and complaint. The object in this place is to conſider how far they are extended and aggravated by a monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, by a conſtitution the very eſſence of which is to accumulate enormous wealth upon a ſingle head, and to render the oſtentation of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor the choſen inſtrument for ſecuring honour and veneration. The object is to conſider in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the luxury of courts, the effeminate ſoftneſs of favourites, the ſyſtem, never to be ſeparated from the monarchical form, of putting men's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and good word at a price, of individuals buying the favour of government, and government buying the favour of individuals, is injurious to the moral improvement of mankind. As long as the unvarying practice of courts is cabal, and as long as the unvarying tendency of cabal is to bear down talents, and diſcourage virtue, to recommend cunning in the room of ſincerity, a ſervile and ſupple diſpoſition in preference to firmneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility, a convenient morality as better than a ſtrict one, and the ſtudy of the red book of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion rather than the ſtudy of general welfare, ſo long will monarchy be the bittereſt and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all the adverſaries of the true intereſts of mankind.</p>

               <p>WHERE the arms in bulk are proper, and conſiſting of citizens, they have other trades, and therefore are no ſoldiers of fortune; and yet becauſe the commonwealth has arms for her trades (in regard ſhe is <hi>a magiſtrate given for the good of mankind, and bears not her ſword in vain</hi>) they are all educated as well in military as civil diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, taking their turns in ſervice of either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to the occaſion, and the orders of the commonwealth, as in <hi>Iſrael, Athens, Lacedemon,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> which had (if their territories permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſometimes as I may ſay whether their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories permitted or no, as in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) the vaſteſt, the higheſt tempered, and the beſt diſciplined mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, that is to be found in the whole compaſs of ſtory.

                  <hi>[From Voltaire's Philoſophical Dictionary.]</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FAMINE, the plague, and war, are the three moſt famous ingredients in this lower world. Under famine may be claſſed all the noxious foods, which want obliges us to have recourſe to; thus ſhortening our life, whilſt we hope to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>In the plague are included all contagious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; and theſe are not leſs than two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Theſe two gifts we hold from providence; but war, in which all thoſe gifts are concentered, we owe to the fancy of three or four hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſcattered over the ſurface of the globe, under the name of princes and miniſters; and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it may be, that in ſeveral dedications, they are called the living images of the Deity.</p>
               <p>The moſt hardened flatterer will allow, that war is ever attended with plague and famine, eſpecially if he has ſeen the military hoſpitals in Germany, or paſſed through any villages where ſome notable feat of arms has been performed.</p>
               <p>It is unqueſtionably a very noble art to ravage countries, deſtroy dwellings, and <hi>communibus annis,</hi> out of a hundred thouſand men to cut off forty thouſand. This invention was originally cultivated by nations, aſſembled for their common good; for inſtance, the diet of the Greeks ſent word to the diet of Phrygia and its neigbours, that they were putting to ſea in a thouſand fiſhing-boats, in order to do their beſt to cut them off root and branch.</p>
               <p>The Roman people, in a general aſſembly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that it was their intereſt to go and fight the Vejentes or the Volſcians before harveſt; and ſome years after, all the Romans being angry with all the Carthaginians, fought a long time both by ſea and land. It is otherwiſe in our time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0127200302:149"/>A genealogiſt ſets forth to a prince that he is deſcended in a direct line from a count, whoſe kindred, three or four hundred years ago, had made a family compact with a houſe, the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of which is extinguiſhed. That houſe had ſome diſtant claim to a province, the laſt proprietor of which died of an apoplexy. The prince and his council inſtantly reſolve, that this province belongs to him by divine right. The province, which is ſome hundred leagues from him, proteſts that it does not ſo much as know him; that it is not diſpoſed to be governed by him; that before preſcribing laws to them, their conſent, at leaſt, was neceſſary: theſe allegations do not ſo much as reach the prince's ears; it is inſiſted on that his right is inconteſtable. He inſtantly picks up a multitude of men, who have nothing to do, nor nothing to loſe; cloaths them with coarſe blue cloth, one ſou to the ell; puts them on hats bound with coarſe white worſted; makes them turn to the right and left; and thus marches away with them to glory.</p>
               <p>Other princes on this armament, take part in it to the beſt of their ability, and ſoon cover a ſmall extent of country, with more hireling murderers than Gengis-Kan, Tamerlane, and Bajazet had at their heels.</p>
               <p>People, at no ſmall diſtance, on hearing that fighting is going forward, and that if they would make one, there are five or fix ſous a day for them, immediately divide into two bands, like reapers, and go and ſell their ſervices to the firſt bidder.</p>
               <p>Theſe multitudes furiouſly butcher one another, not only without having any concern in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, but without ſo much as knowing what it is about.</p>
               <p>Sometimes five or fix powers are engaged, three againſt three, two againſt four, ſometimes even one
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0127200302:150"/>againſt five, all equally deteſting one another; and friends and foes, by turns, agreeing only in one thing, to do all the miſchief poſſible.</p>
               <p>An odd circumſtance in this infernal enterprize is, that every chief of theſe ruffians has his colours conſecrated; and ſolemnly prays to God before he goes to deſtroy his neighbour. If the ſlain in a battle do not exceed two or three thouſand, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate commander does not think it worth thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for; but if, beſides killing ten or twelve thouſand men, he has been ſo far favoured by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as totally to deſtroy ſome remarkable place, then a verboſe hymn is ſung in four parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a language unknown to all the combatants, and beſides ſtuffed with barbariſms<note n="†" place="bottom">Te Deum.</note> The ſame ſong does for marriages and births, as for maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres; which is ſcarce pardonable, eſpecially in a nation of all others the moſt noted for new ſongs.</p>
               <p>All countries pay a certain number of orators to celebrate theſe ſanguinary actions; ſome in a long black coat, and over it a ſhort docked cloak; others in a gown with a kind of ſhirt over it; ſome again over their ſhirts have two pieces of a mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-coloured ſtuff hanging down. They are all very long-winded in their harangues, and to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate a battle fought in Weteravia, bring up what paſſed thouſands of years ago in Paleſtine.</p>
               <p>At other times theſe gentry declaim againſt vice; they prove by ſyllogiſms and antitheſes, that ladies, for ſlightly heightening the hue of their cheeks with a little carmine, will aſſuredly be the eternal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of eternal vengeance; that Polyeucte and Athalia<note n="‡" place="bottom">Two French tragedies.</note> are the devil's works; that he, whoſe table, on a day of abſtinence, is loaded with fiſh to the amount of two hundred crowns, is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaved; and that a poor man, for eating two
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0127200302:151"/>penny-worth of mutton, goes to the devil for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Among five or ſix thouſand ſuch declamations, there may be, and that is the moſt, three or four, written by a Gaul named Maſſillon, which a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman may bear to read; but in not one of all thoſe diſcourſes has the orator the ſpirit to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert on war, that ſcourge and crime which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all others. Theſe groveling ſpeakers are continually prating againſt love, mankind's only ſolace, and the only way of repairing it: not a word do they ſay of the deteſtable endeavours of the mighty for its deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Bourdaloue<note n="§" place="bottom">A celebrated preacher.</note> a very bad ſermon have you made againſt impurity, but not one either bad or good on thoſe various kinds of murders, on thoſe rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, on thoſe violences, that univerſally rage, by which the world is laid waſte! Put together all the vices of all ages and places, and never will they come up to the miſchiefs and enormities of only one campaign.</p>
               <p>Ye bungling ſoul-phyſicians, to bellow for an hour and more againſt a few flea-bites, and not ſay a word about that horrid diſtemper, which tears us to pieces. Burn your books, ye mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing philoſophers! Whilſt the humour of a few ſhall make it an act of loyalty to butcher thouſands of our fellow-creatures, the part of mankind deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to heroiſm will be the moſt execrable and deſtructive monſters in all nature. Of what avail is humanity, benevolence, modeſty, temperance, mildneſs, diſcretion, and piety; when half a pound of lead diſcharged at the diſtance of ſix hundred paces ſhatters my body; when I expire at the age of twenty under pains unſpeakable, and amidſt thouſands in the ſame miſerable condition; when my eyes at their laſt opening ſee my native town
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0127200302:152"/>all in a blaze; and the laſt ſounds I hear are the ſhrieks and groans of women and children expiring among the ruins, and all for the pretended intereſt of a man who is a ſtranger to us!</p>

               <p>HIS majeſty undoubtedly was not elected to the throne. No man can be ſuppoſed, in the teeth of fact, to have contended it; but did not the people of England elect King William, and break the hereditary ſucceſſion? and does not his majeſty's title grow out of that election? It is one of the charges againſt the defendant, his having denied the parliament which called the Prince of Orange to the throne to have been a legal conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole people; and is not the very foundation of that charge, that it was ſuch a legal convention, and that it was intended to be ſo? and if it was ſo, did not the people then confer the crown upon King William without any regard to hereditary right? Did they not cut off the Prince of Wales, who ſtood directly in the line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and who had incurred no perſonal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture? Did they not give their deliverer an eſtate in the crown totally new and unprecedented in the law or hiſtory of the country? And laſtly, might they not, by the ſame authority, have given the royal inheritance to the family of a ſtranger? Mr. Juſtice Blackſtone, in his Commentaries, in terms, aſſerts that they might; and aſcribes their choice of King William, and the ſubſequent limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the crown, not to the want of juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to their true origin, to prudence and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0127200302:154"/>diſcretion in not diſturbing a valuable inſtitution further than public ſafety and neceſſity dictated.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh government ſtands thenon this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic conſent, the true root of all governments. And I agree with Mr. Burke, that, while it is well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, it is not in the power of factions or libels to diſturb it: though when miniſters are in fault, they are ſure to ſet down all diſturbances to theſe cauſes. This is moſt juſtly and eloquently exemplified in the thoughts on the cauſe of the preſent diſcontents, page 5 and 6.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Miniſters contend that no adequate provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been given for ſo ſpreading a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, our affairs having been conducted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with remarkable temper and conſummate wiſdom. The wicked induſtry of ſome libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, joined to the intrigues of a ſew diſappointed politicians, have, in their opinion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation.</p>
                  <p>Nothing, indeed, can be more unnatural than the preſent convulſions of this country, if the above account be a true one. I confeſs I ſhall aſſent to it with great reluctance, and only on the compulſion of the cleareſt and firmeſt proofs; becauſe their account reſolves itſelf into this ſhort but diſcouraging propoſition, 'That we have a very good miniſtry, but that we are a very bad people;' that we ſet ourſelves to bite the hand that feed us; and, with a malignant inſanity, oppoſe the meaſures, and ungratefully vilify the perſons of thoſe whoſe ſole object is our own peace and proſperity. If a few puny libellers, acting under a knot of factious politicians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out virtue, parts, or character (for ſuch they are conſtantly repreſented by theſe gentlemen,) are ſufficient to excite this diſturbance, very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe muſt be the diſpoſition of that people, amongſt whom ſuch a diſturbance can be excited by ſuch means.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0127200302:155"/>
He ſays true: never were ſerious diſturbances excited by ſuch means!</p>
               <p>But to return to the argument.—Let us now ſee how the rights of the people ſtand upon authority, and whether this great ſource of government is not maintained by perſons on whom my friend will find it hard to faſten the character of libellers.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the moſt modern author on the ſubject of government—a gentleman, whoſe work lies ſpread out before me, as it often does for my delight and inſtruction in my leiſure hours. I have alſo, by the favour of a friend who ſits near me in court, the honour of his perſonal acquaintance, He is a man, perhaps more than any other, devoted to the real conſtitution of the country, as will be found throughout his valuable work; and he is a perſon, beſides of great learning, which enable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him to infuſe much uſeful knowledge into my learned friend who introduced me to him. [Mr. Law, king's counſel.] I ſpeak of Mr. Paley, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Carliſle, and of his work, entitled, The Principles of Political and Moral Philoſophy, in which he inveſtigates the firſt principles of all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, a diſcuſſion not thought dangerous till lately; and I hope we ſhall ſoon get rid of this ridiculous panic.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paley profeſſes to think of government what the chriſtian religion was thought of by its firſt teachers: 'If it be of God it will ſtand;' and he puts the duties of obedience to them upon free will and moral duty. After diſſenting from Mr. Locke as to the origin of governments in compact, he ſays.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the application, we aſſign for the only ground of the ſubjects obligation, THE WILL OF GOD, AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0127200302:156"/>The ſteps by which the argument proceeds are few and direct. 'It is the will of God that the happineſs of human life be promoted;' this is the firſt ſtep, and the foundation, not only of this, but of every moral concluſion. 'Civil ſociety conduces to that end;' this is the ſecond propoſition, 'civil ſocieties cannot be upheld, unleſs in each, the intereſt of the whole ſociety be binding upon every part and member of it;' this is the third ſtep, and conducts us to the concluſion, namely, 'That, ſo long as the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the whole ſociety requires it (that is, ſo long as the eſtabliſhed government cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted or changed without public inconveniency) it is the will of God (which will univerſally determines our duty) that the eſtabliſhed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be obeyed,' <hi>and no longer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who ſhall judge of this? We anſwer, <hi>Every man for himſelf.'</hi> In contentions between the ſovereign and the ſubject, the parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no common arbitrator; and it would be abſurd to commit the deciſion to thoſe whoſe conduct has provoked the queſtion, and whoſe own intereſt, authority, and fate, are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned in it. The danger of error and ahuſe is no objection to the rule of expediency, becauſe every other rule is liable to the ſame or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon the ſubject (like all rules which appeal to, or bind the conſcience) muſt, in the application depend upon private judgment. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, however, that it ought equally to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the exerciſe of a man's private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether he determines by reaſonings and concluſions of his own, or ſubmits to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the advice of others, provided he be free to chooſe his guide.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He then proceeds in a manner rather inconſiſtent
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0127200302:157"/>with the principles entertained by my learned friend in his opening to you:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>No uſage, law, or authority whatever, is ſo binding that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be changed with advantage to the community. The family of the prince—the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſucceſſion—the prerogative of the crown —the form and parts of the legiſlature—together with the reſpective powers, office, duration, and mutual dependency of the ſeveral parts, are all only ſo many laws, mutable, like other laws, whenever expediency requires, either by the ordinary act of the legiſlature, or, if the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion deſerve it, BY THE INTERPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No man can ſay that Mr. Paley intended to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe diſcontent by this declaration. He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be taken to think with me that freedom and affection, and the ſenſe of advantages, are the beſt and the only ſupports of government. On the ſame principle he then goes on to ſay, <q>Theſe points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe; they are repreſented to the mind as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the conſtitution, ſettled by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and being ſettled, to be no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to innovation or debate; as foundations never to be ſtirred; as the terms and conditions of the ſocial compact, to which every citizen of the ſtate has engaged his fidelity, by virtue of a promiſe which he cannot now recall. Such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have no place in our ſyſtem.</q>

               <p>Such are the ſentiments of this excellent author, and there is no part of Mr. Paine's work, from the one end of it to the other, that advances any other propoſition.</p>
               <p>But the attorney-general will ſay, theſe are the grave ſpeculative opinions of a friend to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh government, whereas Mr. Paine is its profeſſed enemy; what then? the principle is, that every
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0127200302:158"/>man, while he obeys the laws, is to think for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to conduct himſelf as he thinks. The very ends of ſociety exact this licence, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the law, in its proviſions for its ſecurity, has tacitly ſanctioned it. The real fact is, that writings againſt a free and well-proportioned go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, need not be guarded againſt by laws. They cannot often exiſt, and never with effect. The juſt and awful principles of ſociety, are rarely brought forward, but when they are inſulted or denied, or abuſed in practice; Mr, Locke's Eſſay on Government, we owe to Sir Robert Filmer, as we owe Mr. Paine's to Mr. Burke; and indeed, between the arguments of Filmer and Burke, I ſee no eſſential difference; ſince it is not worth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, whether a king exiſts by <hi>divine</hi> right, or indiſſoluble <hi>human</hi> compact, if he exiſts whether we will or no; if his exiſtence be without our conſent, and to continue without our benefit, it matters not a farthing, whether his title be from God or from man.</p>

               <p>I WAS not at *** when your letter came; you embarraſs me greatly; I ſhall only anſwer you for the pleaſure of entertaining myſelf with a man who is much better able to reſolve the doubts which he propoſed, than the perſon to whom he ſent them.</p>
               <p>I am not of your opinion with regard to deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and deſpotic princes. It appears to me horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abſurd to the laſt degree, that a whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0127200302:159"/>ſhould blindly ſubject themſelves to the caprice of one, even if he were an angel. For my own part, I would not live under him a ſingle day. This angel may become in a moment a monſter, thirſting after blood. Deſpotiſm is to me the moſt abominable and diſguſtful of all bad governments; man is perpetually cruſhed, debaſed, and degraded by it. Look into hiſtory, ancient and modern, if ever there was one upon earth that was not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on mankind, and the diſgrace of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Monarchy would doubtleſs be the beſt of governments, if it was poſſible to find ſuch kings as Henry IV, the only one who ever deſerved the homage and veneration of his ſubjects. Kings ſhould always be brought up in the ſchool of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as this great man was; ſuch alone are truly great, and the lovers of mankind. Before we can feel for the misfortunes of others, we muſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been unfortunate. But on the other hand, the hearts of princes, corrupted by proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the ſlaves of pride and folly, are inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to pity, and inſenſible to true glory.</p>
               <p>I am not at all ſurprized, that in monarchies, and eſpecially in our own, there ſhould be ſo few princes worthy of eſteem. Incircled by corrupters, knaves, and hypocrites, they accuſtom themſelves to look upon their fellow-creatures with diſdain, and ſet no value on any but the ſycophants, who careſs their vices and live in perpetual idleneſs and inactivity. Such is generally the condition of a monarch; great men are always ſcarce, and great kings ſtill more ſo. Add to this, that the ſplendor of a monarchy is ſhort and tranſitory. France is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſunk into miſery and diſgrace; an age more will annihilate her, or ſhe will fall a prey to the firſt intrepid conqueror.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh government has nothing to ſupport it but a deluſive outſide, extremely flattering to the people, who fancy themſelves the ſole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0127200302:160"/>I do not know any country where it is more eaſy to create ſuch open diſſentions as may overthrow the ſtate. A man of ſenſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity may, in ten years time, erect himſelf into a deſpotic prince with more ſafety at London than at Moſcow: Remember Crom well. Money alone is ſufficient to corrupt the whole parliament.</p>
               <p>The great, ever fond of riches and power, and proſtrate at the feet of fortune, who always attend the throne, will promote the views of their maſter; and the great, once gained over, this phantom of liberty, which appears at intervals in the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions of the commons, which awakens, ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es itſelf, and ſoon vaniſhes, will be totally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated at the firſt ſignal given by the Supreme Ruler.</p>
               <p>I know indeed of no monarchy that is fixed, conſtant and perfect; the wiſeſt kings oppreſs their ſubjects to arrive at deſpotiſm. Adieu, my friend; live in freedom and obſcurity. Solitude will procure you the beſt and trueſt pleaſure, ſelf-content. The fooliſh and the wicked ſeen far off, will only excite your compaſſion; to look nearly upon them, would raiſe your contempt and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                  <p>Sir, it is well known we are a trading nation, and conſequently cannot thrive in a bargain where nothing is to be gained. The poor electors, who run from their ſhops, or the plough, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their country, are they not to be conſidered for their labour and their loyalty? The candidates, who, with the hazard of their perſons, the loſs of their characters, and the ruin of their fortunes, are preferred to the ſenate, in a country where they are ſtrangers, before the very lords of the ſoil; are they not to be rewarded for their zeal to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſervice, and qualified to live in your metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis as becomes the luſtre of their ſtations.</p>
                  <p>Sir, if I have given great numbers of the moſt profitable employments among my own relations and neareſt allies, it was not out of any partiality, but becauſe I know them beſt, and can beſt depend upon them. I have been at the pains to mould and cultivate their opinions. Abler heads might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have been found, but they would not be equally under my direction. A huntſman, who hath the abſolute command of his dogs, will hunt more effectually than with a better pack, to whoſe manner and cry he is a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>Sir, upon the whole, I will appeal to all thoſe who beſt knew your royal father, whether that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0127200302:162"/>bleſſed monarch had ever one axious thought for the public, or diſappointment, or uneaſineſs, or want of money for all his occaſions, during the time of my adminiſtration? And, how happy the people confeſſed themſelves to be under ſuch a king, I leave to their own numerous addreſſes; which all politicians will allow to be the moſt infallible proof how any nation ſtands affected to their ſovereign.</p>

               <p>A ſtill more flagrant inſtance of cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice toward the poor, is the practice of <hi>impreſſing.</hi> The labour of the poor man conſtitutes the whole of his wealth, and his domeſtic connections almoſt the whole of his happineſs. But on a ſudden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dubious authority of a preſs-warrant, he is cut off from his peaceful habitation and domeſtic ſociety, and forcibly dragged on board the floating priſon of a tender: he is compelled to labour in the dreadful ſervice of murdering his fellow-creatures at the command of his ſuperiors, and paid ſuch ſcanty wages, not as he can earn or deſerves, but as the niggardly ſyſtem of government finance thinks fit to allow. His family, mean while, who look up to him for comfort and ſubſiſtence, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his misfortune, are anxiouſly expecting his wonted return; perhaps their homely repaſt for the night depended on his earnings for the day: but his uſual hour of return to his family is gone by; each paſſing footſtep, each noiſe of diſtant ſimilarity, is eagerly liſtened to in vain: Hope ſtill draws out the lengthened evening, till a ſleepleſs night of lamentation and deſpair ſucceeds the dreary melancholy hours of ſucceſſive diſappointment and fruitleſs expectation. The next, or ſucceeding day, brings the mournful tidings of his deſtiny; and leaves the widowed wife (perhaps the pregnant mother) to eke out a comfortleſs exiſtence, unde: the accumulated preſſure of want, and labour, an ſorrow, and diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Innumerable are the caſes of this nature, that muſt of neceſſity attend the practice of impreſſing for ſoldiers and mariners. But the miſeries of the lower claſſes of ſociety are borne in torpid ſilence, and patient reſignation, The feeble voice of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering poverty can ſeldom extend beyond the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0127200302:171"/>limits of her own habitation; ſtill leſs can it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the joyous manſions of the great, or intrude on the pompous occupations of the ſtateſman:—otherwiſe, it might truly ſuggeſt, that even if WARS <hi>be</hi> neceſſary, this tyrannical ſyſtem of violence and robbery is not ſo. It is the offspring of ſtate-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony alone. Why not add a fourth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a half, to the common wages, to induce volunteers? Why not double the pay?—Why not?—Becauſe the over-grown fortunes of the rich land-holders, the monopolizers of waſtes and commons, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience an almoſt imperceptible diminution. While, by the good old faſhion of dragging away the poor, by means of a preſs-gang, no taxes are laid upon the wealthy; and a due portion of the Swiniſh multitude, the ſcum of the earth, are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodically ſwept away as food for powder.</p>
               <p>Such are ſome among the numerous hardſhips of which the Britiſh poor have too much reaſon to complain. Indigence, one would think, is of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſufficient evil to an inhabitant of ſociety, without being held out as a reproach, or converted into a crime. Why then ſhould ſlavery be added to poverty, and the rights of man be emerged in the misfortunes of the citizen? A citizen, indeed, is an improper appellation; the poor man is not a citizen: for being denied, <hi>even by the ſpirit of the conſtitution,</hi> the privilege of repreſentation, he is ſubjected to the will of thoſe who make, and the power of thoſe who execute the laws; and he is at beſt but an inhabitant of his native land, for the benefit of his richer neighbour.</p>
               <p>Hence I cannot help regarding any ſcheme of reform as inſignificant, to ſay no worſe of it, which ſhall not include in the ſcheme itſelf (without truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſtant promiſes and fair profeſſions) ſome effectual means of raiſing and meliorating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of what are called the lower claſſes of the people. <hi>Patriots</hi> (as Dr. Johnſon very ſhrewdly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0127200302:172"/>and ſarcaſtically remarked) <hi>are fond of levelling down to themſelves, but they ſeldom propoſe to level up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> It is fit that this reproach ſhould be done away from the advocates of a good cauſe. It is the people, the lower claſſes of ſociety, that conſtitute the bulk of mankind, that form the great maſs of capability, and preſent to the politician the moſt important object of national improvement. For my own part, I care little in compariſon for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that ſhall ſerve merely to diminiſh the taxes paid by the rich, or gratify the wiſhes of ſenatorial orators or would-be ſtateſmen, whether in or out of parliament. Away with ſuch half-meaſured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers—men of rank and reſpectability, as they ſometimes call themſelves; who deſire no farther reform than to extend the ariſtocratic monopoly of power to that circle in which themſelves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; who make the people the ſtalking-horſe to their deſigns, and the ſtep-ladder to the official ſituations which they aſpire to obtain; who have temperance and moderation in their mouths, and pride and ambition in their hearts; and who raiſe the hue and cry of violence, innovation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm, againſt every man who looks beyond the petty intereſts of a party, or includes in his notions of patriotiſm a deſire to promote not the privileges of a corporation, but the rights of man.</p>
               <p>Hence, alſo, it is to me no matter of ſurprize that the people, the multitude, feel no intereſt in the repeated outcries for parliamentary reform, when the evils they feel are hardly touched upon, and advantages held out which they have no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to enjoy. Who has yet talked of dividing the waſtes and the commons—of aboliſhing tythes—of rewarding population—of comfortably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the old age of the labourer, the manus facturer, the artificer—of exonerating the poor from the indirect taxes which they pay without
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0127200302:173"/>knowing it; as well as from the direct impoſition, which miniſters ſecretly lay on—and above all of providing ample means of PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, that the poor man may know what his rights are, and what is the object of government, and what are the duties of the ſervants of the people. That he may become if he chuſes a human creature, and not a machine; and having the capacity of mental improvement given to him by his Maker, that he may me as he ought the talent thus committed to his care. Why ſhould the truth be concealed? There is among us too much inequality of rank—too much inequality of riches—too much inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of labour. The poor work too much, and know too little: inceſſant labour ſtupifies the mental fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and produces an inclination to ſatisfy the cravings of nature beyond the neceſſities of nature. Hence the amuſements of the poor are groſs; their hours of relaxation intemperate, and habits of drunkenneſs and expence are inſenſibly formed, till the whole man is degraded, and ignorance and poverty linked with him as companions for life. I wiſh it were not true that theſe habits are rather encouraged than ſuppreſſed, that nine tenths of the nation may be mere machines to execute the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, of which the other tenth enjoys the profit.</p>
               <p>My notions then of an effectual reform in the repreſentation of the people would take in the whole of that ariſtocratical apoſtate the Duke of Richmond's idea, in his Letter to Colonel Sharman. I would have the man, whoſe ſtake in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity conſiſts of life, and liberty, and labour, with a penny in his pocket, to have an equal voice in the choice of legiſlators, by whoſe laws that ſtake is to be protected, with another man who has life, and liberty, and labour, with a hundred thouſand pounds in his pocket. In compariſon with the three firſt articles of the catalogue, which are cotm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, (and which are the means to ihe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0127200302:174"/>acquiſition of the reſt) the laſt is of trifling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is the ſmall duſt of the balance, an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of exiſtence; of artificial, and not of natural importance; which when weighed againſt the ſolid gifts of nature to her common offspring, will kick the beam.</p>

               <p>AS liberty can never ſubſiſt without equality, nor equality be long preſerved without an <hi>Agrarian</hi> law, or ſomething like it; ſo when men's riches are become immeaſurably or ſurprizingly great, a people, who regard their own ſecurity, ought to make a ſtrict enquiry how they came by them, and oblige them to take down their own ſize, for fear of terrifying the community, or maſtering it. In every country and under every government, particular men may be too rich.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Romans</hi> had well obſerved the <hi>Agrarian</hi> law, by which the extent of every citizen's eſtate was aſcertained, ſome citizens could never have riſen ſo high as they did above others; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, one man could never have been ſet above all the reſt, and have eſtabliſhed, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did at laſt, a tyranny in that great and glorious ſtate. I have always thought that an enquiry into men's fortunes, eſpecially monſtrous fortunes raiſed out of the public, like <hi>Milton</hi>'s infernal palace, as it were in an inſtant, was of more importance to a nation, than ſome other enquiries which I have heard of.</p>
               <p>But, will ſome ſay, is it a crime to be rich? Yes, certainly, at the public expence, or to the danger of the public. A man may be too rich for a ſubject; even the revenues of kings may be too
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0127200302:175"/>large. It is one of the effects of arbitrary power, that the prince has too much, and the people too little; and ſuch inequality may be the cauſe too of arbitrary power. It is as aſtoniſhing as it is melancholy, to travel through a whole country, as one may through many in <hi>Europe,</hi> gaſping under endleſs impoſts, groaning under dragoons and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and all to make a wanton and luxurious court, filled for the moſt, with the worſt and vileſt of all men. Good God! What hard-heartedneſs and barbarity, to ſtarve perhaps half a province, to make a gay garden! And yet ſometimes even this groſs wickedneſs is called public ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe forſooth a few workmen and labourers are maintained out of the bread and the blood of half a million.</p>
               <p>In thoſe countries, were the judgment of the people conſulted, things would go better; but they are deſpiſed, and eſteemed by their governors <hi>happy enough, if they do not eat graſs;</hi> and having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, or ſhare in the government, they have no remedy. Such indeed is their miſery, that their caſe would be greatly mended, if they could change conditions with the beaſts of the field; for then being deſtined to be eaten, they would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fed: ſuch a misfortune is it to them that their governors are not <hi>cannibals!</hi> Oh HAPPY Britain may'ſt thou continue ever ſo!</p>
               <p>For a concluſion: As the preſervation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is the ſource of national happineſs, whoever violates property, or leſſens or endangers it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe ſays, that he is an enemy to his country, and public ſpirit ſays, that he ſhould feel its ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.

               <p>GOVERNMENT is an inſtitution for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the people governed, which they have power to model as they pleaſe; and to ſay, that they can have too much of this power, is to ſay, that there ought to be a power in the ſtate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that which gives it Being, and from which all juriſdiction in it is derived. Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which has been commonly mentioned, as an extreme of liberty, is indeed its oppoſite. It is government by the will of rapacious individuals in oppoſition to the will of the community, made known and declared in the laws. A free ſtate, at the ſame time that it is free itſelf, makes all its members free by excluding licentiouſneſs, and guarding their perſons and property and good name againſt inſult. It is the end of all juſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the ſame time that it ſecures the liberty of the public againſt <hi>foreign</hi> injury, to ſecure the liberty of the individual againſt <hi>private</hi> injury. I do not, therefore, think it ſtrictly juſt to ſay, that it belongs to the nature of government to entrench on private liberty. It ought never to do this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as far as the exerciſe of private liberty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaches on the liberties of others. That is; it is licentiouſneſs it reſtrains, and liberty itſelf only when uſed to deſtroy liberty.</p>
               <p>It appears from hence, that licentiouſneſs and deſpotiſm are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike inconſiſtent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that the one is the licentiouſneſs of <hi>great</hi> men, and the other the licentiouſneſs of <hi>little</hi> men; or that, by the one, the perſons and property of a people are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0127200302:177"/>ſubject to outrage and invaſion from a king, or a lawleſs body of <hi>grandees;</hi> and that, by the other, they are ſubject to the like outrage from a <hi>lawleſs mob.</hi>—In avoiding one of theſe evils, mankind have often run into the other. But all well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted governments guard equally againſt both. Indeed of the two, the laſt is, on ſeveral accounts, the leaſt to be dreaded, and has done the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. It may be truly ſaid, that if licentiouſneſs has deſtroyed its thouſands, deſpotiſm has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed its millions. The former, having little power, and no ſyſtem to ſupport it, neceſſarily finds its own remedy; and <hi>a people ſoon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it.</hi> But a deſpotiſm, wearing the form of government, and being armed with its force, is an evil not to be conquered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dreadful ſtruggles. It goes on from age to age, debaſing the human faculties, levelling all diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and preying on the rights and bleſſings of ſociety.—It deſerves to be added, that in a ſtate diſturbed by licentiouſneſs, there is an animation which is favourable to the human mind, and which puts it upon exerting its powers.

                     <hi>are born under government, and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one. Every one is born a ſubject to his father, or his prince, and is therefore under the perpetual tie of ſubjection and allegiance."</hi> But it is plain, mankind never owned nor conſidered any ſuch natural <hi>ſubjection that they were born in,</hi> to one or to the other, that tied them, without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, to a ſubjection to them and their heirs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is true, that whatever engagements or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes any one has made for himſelf, he is under the obligation of them, but cannot, by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact whatſoever, bind his children or poſterity; for his ſon, when a man, being altogether as free as his father, <hi>any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the ſon, than it can of any body elſe.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So much for Mr. Locke's opinion of the Rights of Mankind. Let us now examine his ideas of the ſuppoſed danger of truſting them with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Perhaps it will be ſaid, that the people being ignorant, and always diſcontented, to lay the foundation of government in the unſteady opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expoſe it to certain ruin; and no government will be able long to ſubſiſt, if the people may ſet up a new legiſlature, whenever they take offence at the old one. To this, I anſwer quite the contrary: People are not ſo eaſily got out of their old forms, as ſome are apt to ſuggeſt; they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0127200302:180"/>are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged faults in the frame they have been accuſtomed to; and if there be any original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or adventitious ones introduced by time, or corruption, it is not an eaſy thing to be changed, even when all the world ſees there is an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it. This ſlowneſs and averſion in the people to quit their old Conſtitutions, has in the many revolutions which have been ſeen in this kingdom, in this and former ages, ſtill kept us to, or after ſome interval of fruitleſs attempts, ſtill brought us back again to our old legiſlative of kings, lords, and commons; and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from ſome of our princes heads, they never carried the people ſo far as to place it in another line.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I wiſh I had ſtrength to go on with all that is material, but I have read enough, not only to maintain the true principles of government, but to put to ſhame the narrow ſyſtem of diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that Mr. Locke went great lengths in his poſitions, to beat down the contrary doctrine of divine right, which was then endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the new eſtabliſhment. But that cannot be objected to Mr. David Hume, who maintains the ſame doctrine; ſpeaking of the Magna Charta in his hiſtory, vol. 2. Page 88, he ſays, <q>It muſt be confeſſed, that the former articles of the great Charter, contain ſuch mitigations and explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the feudal law, as are reaſonable and equitable; and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the equal diſtribution of juſtice and free enjoyment of property; the great object for which political ſociety was founded by men, <hi>which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall;</hi> and which no time, nor precedent, nor ſtatute, nor poſitive inſtitution, ought to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0127200302:181"/>deter from keeping ever uppermoſt in their thoughts and attention.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe authorities are ſufficient to reſt on, yet I cannot omit Mr. Burke himſelf, who is, if poſſible, ſtill more diſtinct on the ſubject, ſpeaking not of the ancient people of England, but of colonies planted almoſt within our memories, he ſays, <q>If there he one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this; that the diſpoſition of the people of America, is wholly averſe to any other than a free government, and this is indication enough to any honeſt ſtateſman, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their caſe. If any aſk me what a free government is, I anſwer, THAT IT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK SO; AND THAT THEY, AND NOT I, ARE THE NATURAL, LAWFUL AND COMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENT JUDGES OF THIS MATTER. If they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is conſiſtent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom, I ought to thank them for ſo great a truſt, and not to endeavour to prove from thence, that they have reaſoned amiſs, and that having gone ſo far, by analogy, they muſt hereafter have no enjoyment but by my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am ſorry to feel my time conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conſumed, before I am arrived at what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the material ſubject of your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For all that I have been ſtating now, is only to ſhew, that there is not that novelty in the opinions of the defendant, that ſhould lead you to think that he does not <hi>bona ſide</hi> entertain them, much leſs when connected with the hiſtory of his life, which I therefore brought in review before you—But ſtill the great queſtion remains unargued: Had he a right to promulgate theſe opinions? Gentlemen, if he entertained them, I ſhall argue that he had—And although my arguments upon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0127200302:182"/>the Liberty of the Preſs, may not to day be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your, or the court's approbation, I ſhall retire not at all diſheartened, conſoling myſelf with the reflection, that a ſeaſon may arrive for their reception.—The moſt eſſential freedoms of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have been but ſlowly and gradually received, and ſo very late, indeed, do ſome of them come to maturity, that not withſtanding the attorney-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tells you that the very queſtion I am now agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, is moſt peculiarly for <hi>your</hi> conſideration, AS A JURY, under our ANCIENT conſtitution, yet I muſt remind both you and him, that your juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to conſider and deal with it at all in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is but A YEAR OLD.—When before that late period, I ventured to maintain this very RIGHT OF A JURY, over the queſtion of libel under the ſame <hi>ancient</hi> conſtitution. (I do not mean before my lord, for the matter was gone to reſt in the courts, at leaſt long before he came to ſit where he does.) But when before a noble and reverend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the moſt exalted underſtanding, and of the moſt uncorrupted integrity, to give effect to it, I had occaſion to maintain it, he treated me, not with diſregard, indeed, for of that his nature was incapable; but he put me aſide with indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as you do a child while it is liſping its prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of ſeaſon: and if this had been tried then, inſtead of now, the defendant muſt have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly convicted on the proof of the publication, whatever <hi>you</hi> might have thought of his caſe.—Yet, I have lived to ſee it reſolved, by an almoſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous vote of the whole Parliament of England, that I had all along been in the right. If this be not an awful leſſon of caution concerning opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where are ſuch leſſons to be read!</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have inſiſted, at great length, upon the origin of government, being in the conſent of the people, and detailed the authorities which you have heard upon the ſubject, becauſe I conſider it to be not only a ſupport, but, indeed, the only foundation of the liberty of the preſs. If Mr.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0127200302:183"/>Burke be right in HIS principles of government, I admit that the preſs, in my ſence of its Freedom, ought not to be free, <hi>nor free in any ſenſe at all;</hi> and that all addreſſes to the people upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of government, and all ſpeculations of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of what kind or nature ſoever, are illegal and criminal:—For, if the people have, without poſſible recall, delegated all their authorities, they have no juriſdiction to act and therefore none to think, upon ſuch ſubjects, and it is a libel to arraign government or any of its acts, before thoſe that have no juriſdiction to correct them. But on the other hand, as it is a ſettled rule in the law of England, that the ſubject may always addreſs a competent juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on every matter within it, no legal argument can ſhake the freedom of the preſs in any ſenſe of it, if I am ſupporaed in my doctrines concerning the great unalienable rights of the people, to change or reform their government.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is becauſe the Liberty of the Preſs reſolves itſelf into this great iſſue, that it has been in every time and country, the laſt liberty which ſubjects have been able to wreſt from power.— Other liberties are held under governments, but the liberty of opinion keeps governments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in due ſubjection to their duties. This has produced the martyrdom of truth in every age, and <hi>the world has only purged itſelf from ignorance with the innocent blood of thoſe who have enlightened it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my ſtrength and time are waſted, and I can only make this melancholy hiſtory paſs like a ſhadow before you.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the grand type and example.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0127200302:186"/>was to prevent ſuch conſequences, that Mr. Burke ſo benevolently counſelled the princes of Europe to undertake that <hi>cruſade</hi> in which they are now ſo piouſly engaged.</p>
               <p>If, on the other hand, the efforts of France be unſucceſsful; if her liberties be deſtroyed, there can be little doubt that ſuch a ſhock will moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully impel the current of opinion to the ſide of monarchy: a direction in which it will be likely for ſeveral ages to continue. The example of the deſtruction of the great French Republic would diffuſe, diſmay, and ſubmiſſion among a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who only judge by events; and the bloody ſcenes which muſt attend ſuch a deſtruction, would indeed be ſufficient to appal the ſterneſt and moſt ardent champions of liberty. The ſpirit of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope would crouch under the dark ſhade of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, in dead repoſe and fearful obedience. The royal confederacy which had effected this ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would doubtleſs continue its concert and its efforts. The principle of maintaining the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal independence of nations, being deſtroyed by the example of France, no barrier would any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be oppoſed to the arbitrary will of kings.

               <p>I PROCEED to conſider monarchy, not as it exiſts in countries where it is unlimited and deſpotic, but, as in certain inſtances it has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a branch merely of the general conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Here it is only neceſſary to recollect the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which applied to it in its unqualified ſtate, in order to perceive that they bear upon it with the ſame explicitneſs, if not with great force, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every poſſible modification. Still the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is founded in falſehood, affirming that a certain individual is eminently qualified for an important ſituation, whoſe qualifications are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſcarcely ſuperior to thoſe of the meaneſt member of the community. Still the government is founded in injuſtice, becauſe it raiſes one man for a permanent duration over the heads of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0127200302:190"/>of the community, not for any moral recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he poſſeſſes, but arbitrarily and by accident. Still it reads a conſtant and powerful leſſon of immorality, to the people at large, or exhibiting pomp and ſplendour, and magnificence, inſtead of virtue, as the index to general veneration and eſteem. The individual is, not leſs than in the moſt abſolute monarchy, unfited by his education to become either reſpectable or uſeful. He is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly and cruelly placed in a ſituation that engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ignorance, weakneſs and preſumption, after having been ſtripped in his infancy, of all the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that ſhould defend him againſt the inro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds of theſe adverſaries. Finally, his exiſtence implies that of a train of courtiers and a ſeries of intrigue, of ſervility, ſecret influence, capricious partialities and pecuniary corruption. So true is the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monteſquieu, that "we muſt not expect under a monarchy to find the people virtuous."</p>
               <p>But if we conſider the queſtion more narrowly, we ſhall perhaps find, that unlimited monarchy has other abſurdities and vices which are peculiarly its own. In an abſolute ſovereignty, the king may if he pſeaſe be his own miniſter, but in a limited one a miniſtry and a cabinet are eſſential parts of the conſtitution. In an abſolute ſovereignty, princes are acknowledged to be reſponſible only to God; but in a limited one there is a reſponſibility of a very different nature. In a limited monarchy there are checks, one branch of the government coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting the exceſſes of another, and a check without reſponſibility, is the moſt flagrant of all contradictions.</p>
               <p>It was a confuſed feeling of theſe truths, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodueed into limited monarchies, the principle "that the king can do no wrong<note n="†" place="bottom">This, it muſt be confeſſed, is a maxim of the Engliſh law; but, whatever meaning it may have, the examples of Edward II. Richard II. Charles I. and James II. ſufficiently prove that the kings of England are neither incapable of doing wrong nor exempt from being puniſhed for it. Note added by one of the Swiniſh Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note>". Obſerve
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0127200302:191"/>the peculiar conſiſtency of this proceeding. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a ſpecimen it affords us of plain dealing, frankneſs and unalterable ſincerity. An indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual is firſt appointed, and endowed with the moſt momentous prerogatives, and then it is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, not he, but other men are anſwerable for the abuſe of theſe prerogatives. This pretence may appear tolerable to men bred among the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of law, but justice, truth and virtue revolt from it with indignation.</p>
               <p>Having first invented this fiction, it becomes the buſineſs of ſuch constitutions as nearly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to realiſe it. A ministry must be regularly formed; they must concert together; and the meaſures they execute must originate in their own diſcretion. The king muſt be reduced as nearly as poſſible to a cypher, So far as he fails to be completely ſo, the constitution must be imperfect.</p>
               <p>What ſort of a figure is it that this miſerable wretch exhibits in the face of the world? Every thing is with great parade tranſacted in his name. He aſſumes all the inflated and oriental style which has been already deſcribed, and which indeed was upon that occaſion tranſcribed from the practice of a limited monarchy. We find him like Pharaoh's frogs "in our houſes and upon our beds, in our ovens, and our kneading troughs."</p>
               <p>Now obſerve the man himſelf to whom all this importance is annexed. To be idle is the abſtract of all his duties. He is paid an immenſe revenue only to dance and to eat, to wear a ſcarlet robe and a crown. He may not chooſe any one of his meaſures. He muſt liſten with docility to the conſultations of his miniſters, and ſanction with a ready aſſent whatever they determine. He muſt not hear any other adviſers for they are his known and conſtitutional counſellors. He muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to any man his opinion, for that would be a ſiniſter and unconſtitutional interference.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0127200302:192"/>To be abſolutely perfect he muſt have no opinion, but be the vacant and colourieſs mirror, by which theirs is reflected. He ſpeaks, for they have taught him what he ſhould ſay; he affixes his ſignature, for they inform him that it is neceſſary and proper.</p>
               <p>A limited monarchy in the articles I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, might be executed with great facility and applauſe, if a king were what ſuch a conſtitution endeavours to render him, a mere puppet, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by pullies and wires<note n="*" place="bottom">Such a monarch has been projected; and as the ſcheme may poſſibly pleaſe the pigs, is will follow this extract.</note>. But it is perhaps the moſt egregious and palpable of all political miſtakes to imagine that we can reduce a human being to this ſtate of neutrality and torpor. He will not exert any uſeful and true activity, but he will be far from paſſive. The more he is excluded from that energy, that characteriſes wiſdom and virtue, the more depraved and unreaſonable will he be in this caprices. Is any promotion vacant, and do we expect that he will never think of bestowing it on a favourite, or of proving by an occaſional election of his own, that he really exists? This promotion may happen to be of the utmost importance to the public welfare; or, if not; every promotion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritedly given is pernicious to national virtue, and an upright minister will refuſe to aſſent to it. A king does not fail to hear his power and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives extolled, and he will no doubt at ſome time wiſh to eſſay their reality in an unprovoked war against a foreign nation or against his own citizens.</p>
               <p>Such then is the genuine and uncontrovertible ſcene of a mixed monarchy. An individual placed at the ſummit of the edifice, the centre and the fountain of honour, and who is neutral, or muſt ſeem neutral in the current tranſactions of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This is the firſt leſſon of honour, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and truth, which mixed monarchy reads to its ſubjects. Next to the king come his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0127200302:193"/>and the tribe of courtiers; men driven by a fatal neceſſity, to be corrupt, intriguing and venal; ſciected for their truſt by the moſt ignorant and ill-informed of their countrymen; made ſolely accountable for meaſures of which they cannot ſolely be the authors; threatened, if diſhoneſt, with the vengeance of an injured people; and, if honeſt, with the ſurer vengeance of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s diſpleaſure. The reſt of the nation, the ſubjects at large.</p>
               <p>Was ever a name ſo fraught with degradation and meanneſs as this of ſubjects? I am, it ſeem, by the very place of my birth, become a ſubject. Of what, or whom? Can an honeſt man conſider himſelf as the ſubject of any thing but the laws of juſtice? Can he acknowledge a ſuperior, or hold himſelf bound to ſubmit his judgment to the will of another, not leſs liable than himſelf to prejudice and error? Such is the idol that monarchy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in lieu of the divinity of truth and the ſacred obligation of public good. It is of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whether we vow fidelity to the king and the nation, or to the nation and the king, ſo long as the king intrudes himſelf to tarniſh and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the true ſimplicity, the altar of virtue.</p>
               <p>Are mere names beneath our notice, and will they produce no ſiniſter influence upon the mind? May we bend the knee before the ſhrine of vanity and folly without injury? Far otherwiſe. Mind had its beginning in ſenſation, and it depends upon words and ſymbols for the progreſs of its aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The true good man must not only have a heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſolved, but a front erect. We cannot practiſe objection, hypocriſy and meanneſs, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming degraded in other men's eyes and in our own. We cannot "bow the head in the temple of Rimmon," without in ſome degree apoſtatiſing from the divinity of truth. He that calls a king a man, will perpetually hear from his own mouth the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0127200302:194"/>leſſon that he is unfit for the truſt repoſed in him he that calls him by any ſublimer appellation, is haſtening faſt into the moſt palpable and dangerous errors.</p>
               <p>But perhaps "mankind are ſo weak and imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, that it is in vain to expect from the change of their inſtitutions the improvement of their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." Who made them weak and imbecile? Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to human inſtitutions they had certainly none of this defect. Man conſidered in himſelf is merely a being capable of impreſſion, a recipient of perceptions. What is there in this abſtract cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that precludes him from advancement? We have a faint diſcovery in individuals at preſent of what our nature is capable: why ſhould individuals be fit for ſo much, and the ſpecies for nothing? Is there any thing in the ſtructure of the globe that forbids us to be virtuous? If not, if nearly all our impreſſions of right and wrong flow from our intercourſe with each other, why may not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe be ſuſceptible of modification and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? It is the moſt cowardly of all ſyſtems that would repreſent the diſcovery of truth as uſeleſs, and teach us that, when diſcovered, it is our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to leave the maſs of our ſpecies in error.</p>
               <p>There is not in reality the ſmalleſt room for ſcepticiſm reſpecting the omnipotence of truth. Truth is the pebble in the lake; and however ſlowly in the preſent caſe the circles ſucceed each other, they will infallibly go on till they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the ſurface. No order of mankind will for ever remain ignorant of the principles of juſtice, equality and public good.

               <p>Let us beware by an unjuſtifiable perverſion of terms of confounding the common underſtanding of mankind. A king is the well known and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appellation for an office, which, if there be any truth in the arguments of the preceding chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, has been the bane and the grave of human virtue. Why endeavour to purify and exorciſe what is entitled only to execration? why not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the term to be as well underſtood and as cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deteſted as the once honourable appellation of tyrant, afterwards was among the Greeks? Why not ſuffer it to reſt a perpetual monument of the folly, the cowardice and miſery of our ſpecies?</p>

               <p>IF I were a Corſican, I ſhould certainly be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel; that is, I ſhould hazard my life and eſtate to recover my liberty; but if after all I muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be a ſlave, I would be a ſlave to Baron Nieuhoff<note n="†" place="bottom">Theodore Baron Nieuhoff, elected King of Corfica.</note>, or even to a Ruſſian Bojar, rather than to my old taſk maſters of Genoa.</p>
               <p>The Corfican chiefs, if they would be adviſed by me, ſhould form the plan of their future govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even while their affairs are low, and the event uncertain, leſt, hereafter, they ſuffer great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evils than ever yet they have felt, by inteſtine diviſions; and are prompted by a ſpirit of jealouſy or ambition to deſtroy one another, when they have no other enemies to conquer. Were I to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0127200302:196"/>preſide in their council, and the direction of this important affair were to be left to my judgment, I would not make choice of any form of government which is now adminiſtered in the world: neither would I borrow my ſyſtem from Plato's republic, or Sir Thomas More's Utopia, which ſound well in theory, but can never be reduced to practice. In ſhort, I would preſerve the rank and dignity of my country, by reſtoring the ancient form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was <hi>kingly</hi> or <hi>monarchial.</hi> A king I would have, and a king with a crown on his head, and a ſcepter in his hand; to whom ſhould be given the title of royal or imperial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. But my king ſhould not be a tyrant. He ſhould be even incapable of committing any acts of violence, or oppreſſion. He ſhould be entirely free from pride, avarice, and ambition. He ſhould neither injure himſelf, or his ſubjects, through the heat and intemperance of youth, or the folly and dotage of old age. Love which has made one king a fool, and another mad, ſhould never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex his head, or hurt his conſtitution. His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould be without blemiſh; and his greateſt enemies (if undeſervedly he muſt have enemies) ſhould not be able to impute to him any impurity of mind, any unfriendly diſpoſition, or unevenneſs of temper. In a word, I would have ſuch a king as Jupiter firſt gave to the frogs<note n="†" place="bottom">See the fable of the frogs who petitioned Jupiter for a king.</note>; who, by the way poſſeſſed his empire by divine right, and therefore his ſubjects were juſtly puniſhed by his ſucceſſor for the inſults which they offered to his perſon and character. However, I would not have a plain unfaſhionable Log. My prince ſhould be made of the heart of oak, and wrought into the ſhape and figure of a man by the moſt ſkilful artiſts in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak intelligibly, I would have an image or ſtatue as big as the life, well ſhaped, and finely
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0127200302:197"/>painted; with a diadem on his head, a royal mantle on his ſhoulders, and a ſcepter in his right hand. He ſhould be placed under a rich canopy, and ſeated on a magnificent throne. A guard of an hundred halberdeers ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend him, not ſo much for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his perſon, as to ſerve for pomp and ſhew at the audience of ambaſſadors. This guard ſhould be the only ſtanding army in Corſica. For as there could be no uſe for ſoldiers, but to defend the country in caſe of an invaſion, ſo, in that caſe, every man ſhould be a ſoldier. There ſhould be an eſtabliſhed militia, in which all the male inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, from eighteen to fifty years of age, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing arms, ſhould be inrolled, as is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed at this day among the Swiſs-Cantons. This militia ſhould be provided with good arms, and regularly exerciſed. The generals, colonels, and regularly exerciſed. The generals, colonels, and all inferior officers, ſhould be named by the ſenate, as well as all other officers military and civil; among the reſt I include all the great officers of the crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then it ſhould not be lawful for any officer to excerciſe the employment confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him, till his nomination had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the king, who ſhould always be allowed a negative voice.</p>
               <p>In like manner, new laws ſhould be of no force till they had received his majeſty's approbation, which ſhould always be ſignified by his ſilence. But whenever he refuſed his aſſent, he muſt be obliged to pronounce the word VETO three times with an audible voice, ſo that it might be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard by all the people.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſecured the liberties of the ſubject, I think it in the next place incumbent on me, as a Corſican legiſlator, to maintain the dignity of the crown. I would not indeed ordain it as an article of faith, that the king held the reins of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a divine indefeaſible right; but yet I would
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0127200302:198"/>have his perſon ſacred and inviolable. His ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of all degrees and orders ſhould approach him with the greateſt reverence. Thoſe who were it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No perſon ſhould preſume to ſit, or ſpit, or cough, or be covered in his preſence; unleſs it might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be thought proper, as a reward for great merit and ſervices to create a claſs of <hi>grandees.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">A Spaniſh grandee keeps his hat on in the king's preſence. He increated by the words, be covered! without further ceremony.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Foreign miniſters, who are ſent to compliment the king on his acceſſion, muſt obſerve the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial eſtabliſhed at the court of Turin, when the King of Sardinia was acknowledged in that quality. All proper laws ſhould be deviſed for his ſecurity. And therefore, if any one ſhould be ſo audacious as to ſteal away his majeſty, or to maim, or disfigure his perſon, or to rob him of his crown or ſceptre, or any part of his robes, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender ſhould be guilty of treaſon, and be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death.</p>
               <p>If any perſon ſhould propoſe in writing, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to aboliſh the preſent form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by depoſing his wooden majeſty, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting in his ſtead a monarch of fleſh and blood, whether man, woman, or beaſt, the offender ſhould likewiſe be guilty of high-treaſon. Provided always, that the words be expreſs and ſufficiently proved, and that no free Corſican be vexed or puniſhed by <hi>innuendos,</hi> and forced conſtructions; or for any figurative, allegorical, or ambiguous ſpeeches. Provided likewiſe, that this law ſhall not extend to reſtrain the freedom of debate in the ſenate and council.</p>
               <p>But now I deſire it may be underſtood, that in this new ſcheme of government, which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for the good people of Corſica, I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0127200302:199"/>the ſubſtance of the king's perſon to be of oak. I do not abſolutely inſiſt that he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways retain a human form. Let it be varied accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigencies of the ſtate, or the humours of the people.</p>
               <p>For the matter, I prefer the oak to all other tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, on account of its duration; and becauſe that tree, conſidered only as a ſimple vegetable, bears ſome analogy to a crown'd head: it having been held ſacred in all countries and ages of the world, The ancient Druids paid a greater veneration to the oak, than to the moſt illuſtrious of the ſons of Adam. And even among us Engliſhmen, in a very inquiſitive and polite age, I mean about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the laſt century, this tree obtained the title of <hi>royal.</hi>—The Greeks and Romans had ſo great a reverence for this tree, as to imagine, that every oak was the habitation of a divinity; and there was an oaken grove, within one of the gates of Rome, where all the trees were worſhipped as ſo many nymphs and goddeſſes.</p>
               <p>But the moſt renowned of all their ſpecies were the Epirotick oaks, the illuſtrious natives of Dodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; who were not only endued with human ſpeech, but were prophets and poets, the moſt exalted characters of mankind; and by which two of the greateſt princes in the world have been ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>If the compaſs of my paper would allow it, I would add much more in honour of the oak. But what I have ſaid may ſuffice, to prevent the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule of political writers, and the objections and indignities, which they might otherwiſe offer to my wooden king.</p>
               <p>I am fully perſuaded, there is not a monarch now living upon the earth, who would not think himſelf very happy, and bleſſed above all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to be heart of oak; eſpecially if he be turned of fifty. And the bleſſing would be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0127200302:200"/>if by this change he might be allowed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive his pedigree from the houſe of Dodona. In truth, an oak of this family is capable of governing the greateſt kingdoms, even the vaſt empire of China and Japan. How would the people of thoſe countries admire his eminent qualities, and the faculties of his mind! And I am ſure they would not preſume to find fault with his perſon and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who was deſcended from as ancient a ſtock, and formed of as good ſtuff as their gods. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ingenuouſly confeſs, that the oaks of this race are not for my purpoſe, and muſt therefore be excluded from my ſcheme of government. Prophets of all complections, nations, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether great or ſmall, whether falſe or true, when they are once made kings, will claim an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute independent ſovereignty. The hiſtory of all ages, and the actions of all the royal prophets, from King David down to King Mahomet, ſufficiently verify my aſſertion. For that reaſon I recommend the oaks of Dodona to the government of the eaſt, where every king and every vice-king is a tyrant.</p>
               <p>As for the monarchs of Corſica, according to my eſtabliſhment, they muſt not have the uſe of ſpeech, and then they will have no uſe for power. Wherefore I adviſe thoſe iſlanders to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with kings that are the growth of their own woods, if they have any woods left. If not, they may import a good ſtout king of any ſize, well ſhaped and poliſhed, and faſhionably dreſſed, from any great city on the continent<note n="†" place="bottom">The principal manufactories of this ſort are thought to be the Hague in Holland, and a little inſignificant place in ſome part of Germany, the name of which I cannot immediately recollect, but believe it begins with an H.</note> I muſt ſubmit to the conſideration of the ſenate, whether they will be at the charge of a queen. For as ſhe can contribute nothing to the ſucceſſion, the expence of the ſculpture, her royal veſtments, ſervants and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0127200302:201"/>officers will be an unneceſſary incumbrance on the civil liſt; beſides I can prove from ancient hiſtory, that a wooden queen, hath ſometimes done as much miſchief as a wooden horſe, and overturned mighty kingdoms.</p>
               <p>I would certainly provide by the ſtrongeſt laws, that no prieſt ſhould have a vote in the ſenate or council, nor any employment about the perſon of his Corſican majeſty. I ſhould be under dreadful apprehenſions, leſt thoſe teeming heads exalt my king into a god, and then tax the people to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh proviſions for his table. <hi>Seeſt thou not how he eateth and drinketh, and thinkeſt thou not that he is a god?</hi> In which caſe, the theocracy of the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en god would prove the worſt kind of tyranny. For this little iſland would ſoon be devoured to manifeſt the power of the governor, and ſupport the luxury of his miniſters; who are better craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than to be diſcovered, like thoſe idiot prieſts of Bel, by a trap door, and a ſack of aſhes ſtrewed upon the pavement.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I am writing this, I am informed by the Holland mail, that King Theodore has abdicated the crown of Corſica, and is now impriſoned for debt at Amſterdam<note n="†" place="bottom">He was long confined on the ſame account, in the King's Bench priſon! and died ſoon after his diſcharge, under the inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent debtors act, having given up his kingdom for the benefit of his creditors.</note>, Though I am as truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the misfortune of this enterpriſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as any of his loving ſubjects, yet I muſt own, it leſſens my grief to conſider, that this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den revolution will make way for my propoſal, and facilitate the acceſſion of my wooden king. For which reaſon, I will direct theſe ſhort hints to be tranſlated into Italian, for the uſe of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſican chiefs, and the people now in arms under their command.</p>
               <p>How ſhall I rejoice to be the inſtrument of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0127200302:202"/>them a king, who, to ſpeak without a figure, can do no wrong! a ſucceſſion of ſuch princes would not be leſs glorious for themſelves, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to their country. They would be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally eſteemed during their reigns, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories ſweet and precious. Happy had it been for the world, if the long catalogue of Roman emperors (three or four only excepted) had been of the wooden ſpecies!</p>
               <p>Reaſon, which is the diſtinguiſhing excellence of human nature, can only prove a bleſſing to thoſe whether princes or private perſons, who are men of honour and virtue.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE continent not being far diſtant from the Iſland of Spenſonia, produced ſeveral inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views between the reſpective inhabitants, and of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0127200302:207"/>courſe frequent traffickings and dealings, which, on the part of the Spenſonians, were conducted with the utmoſt ſimplicity and good faith. This uprightneſs gained much on the affections of the Indians, and naturally produced a yet nearer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Contrary to expectation, they here ſaw a people, much ſuperior in the comforts of life, as independent as themſelves; and though Chriſtians, without thoſe <hi>odious tyrants</hi> to mankind, LAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LORDS. "How," ſaid an Indian to a Spenſonian, "How is it that you have no Landlords? We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard that men could be civilized, or be Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, without giving up their common right to the earth, and its natural produce to tyrants, called Landlords. Among ſuch people, according to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal report, the land is claimed by a few indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, who diſpoſe of it at pleaſure, and parcel it out to others for tribute or rent. Many colonies of Chriſtians have eſtabliſhed themſelves in various parts of America, and carry on here, as in their original country, the iniquitous traffick in the ſoil. They expel, or exterminate us, the natives, becauſe we will not work, or pay rent to them, for living in our own country; neither have theſe Europeans the common honeſty to ſhare equally, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their unrighteous plunder; but levy rents of each other here, as they do at home. Yes, their religion it ſeems will not allow of equality of rights. Their God, they tell us, has ordained that there ſhall be many <hi>ſorts and conditions of men,</hi> and that ſome few ſhall have the lordſhip and diſpoſal of the earth, whilſt the far greater part muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſupplicate to become their tributaries and vaſſals. This has always made us hate your God and your religion. Juſtice being impartiality, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality muſt be injuſtice; and that God, who is ſo partial, cannot be juſt; and not being juſt, cannot be loved. We cannot love injuſtice, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of injuſtice. Neither can we, free-born Indians, ſubmit to pay homage or rent to any man
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0127200302:208"/>for leave to dwell on the earth, though he ſhould ſay that God would have it ſo. But you ſay, <hi>you</hi> are Chriſtians, and that you, <hi>nevertheleſs.</hi> have <hi>no</hi> Landlords; but have an equitable way of enjoying the common benefits of this iſland which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, and yet preſerve to each man his independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! — This is very amazing to me!"</p>
               <p>The curioſity of this Indian was ſatisfied; he was made to comprehend the brotherly ſyſtem, and that the God of the Chriſtians was belied by deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prieſts, colleagued with overbearing knaves; and that he did not approve, but condemned and puniſhed injuſtice, uſurpation, and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>The enraptured Indian ſighed for the domeſtic happineſs of civilized life, combined with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive independence. He was adopted a citizen, and was happy. Other Indians heard, ſaw, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the example. The iſland now became very populous and highly cultivated, and many villages encreaſed to large towns, adorned with public edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and other marks of opulence and refinement; Trade flouriſhed, ſhips were built, and commerce extended to diſtant ſhores its reciprocal bleſſings.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of proſperity (ſays the author of this account) did I find this riſing colony, when by accident, ſome years ago, our ſhip was driven upon this happy iſland.</p>
               <p>I, like the aforeſaid Indian, was aſtoniſhed when I underſtood their ſyſtem of government, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of holding landed property. For inſtead of anarchy, idleneſs, poverty, and meanneſs, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequences, as I narrowly thought, of a ridiculous levelling ſcheme, I ſaw nothing but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, induſtry, wealth, and magnificence. So being anxious to know the utmoſt of this new-faſhioned commonwealth, I took occaſion to have my doubts reſolved by a communicative Spenſonian as follows:</p>

               <p>Auth. <hi>Would it not tend to make the people more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious if they could lay out their riches in poſſeſſions?</hi>

Being poſſeſſed of landed property, men would ceaſe to be otherwiſe induſtrious, than in watching their tenants, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to raiſe their rents, and infringe their liberties. Their poſterity alſo, would become equally uſeleſs, except in the ſame laudable buſineſs of oppreſſion. The ſame pretence, as to objects of induſtry, might extend to religion, and the perſons of men. Why ſhould traffic be denied to monied men in any thing capable of being an object of commerce!! But why deſpair of induſtry? You ſee no want of it among us: No, nor yet among the Jews, though neither they nor we can buy land; but, on the contrary, you ſee a general induſtry, not one idle. Riches, unſupported by an eſtate, would ſoon take wings, if dot prevented by induſtry. But in your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Europe, (for I know your cuſtoms, we came originally from England,) what great incitement, pray, can it be to induſtry, to give the cream of one's endeavours, unthanked to the Landlord? For what Landlord was ever yet thankful for his rents? They think the tenants rather owe thanks to them for permiſſion to live on theit earth forſooth!</p>

Therefore, the ſtories of enormous and tyrannical giants, dwelling in ſtrong caſtles, which have been thought fabulous, may reaſonably be looked upon as diſgaiſed truths, and to have been invented as juſt ſatires upon great lords. For, if thoſe fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous monſters were ſaid to eat the people and their children, your real monſters, of Landlords, really eat their meat, and the ſavour out of every enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; reducing them to ſuch miſery, that eating their bodies, as the giants did, would be much more beneficent. They toil them to death in their endleſs drudgery, haraſs and butcher them in their villainous wars, and drag them from every ſocial connection. Theſe are the monſters, or giants, that the world want to be rid of. The extirpation of theſe ſhould employ the philanthropic giant-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, the deliverers of mankind.</p>
               <p>Auth. <hi>But notwithſtanding all your heat againſt thoſe Landlords, thoſe monſters as you call them, I ſhould like to know why you think they will never get crept in among you, as they have in all other civilized nations?</hi>

                  <hi>Spen.</hi> Why, you muſt know, the intereſt of every individual is ſo intimately and palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with our preſent ſyſtem, that the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation would immediately be felt, and, of courſe, oppoſed. People are generally very much attached to their landed propenty, and ſocieties in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are very tenacious of ſuch, eſpecially when they, as we do, find daily the benefit thereof. Then can we ſuppoſe any would be ſo hardy as attempt to touch a whole nation in ſo ſenſible a part?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Spen.</hi> Well, I will let you ſee that though you were to bribe the whole nation you could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by voting, and that you muſt have a very large majority, before you can have any chance by fighting. You muſt underſtand we never vote but by ballot, or in a ſecret manner, either in parochial or parliamentary buſineſs. Now ſuppoſe you would bribe the whole of the voters in any affair, and I were one of them, I would reaſon thus with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: If I vote as I am brihed to do, I muſt do wrong to the public, whoſe intereſt includes alſo my own, and perhaps the intereſt likewiſe of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.

So, in conſequence of this reaſoning, I would vote againſt you; and ſo would every one elſe from the ſame conſideration. Let us ſee how this caſe will ſtand then? Why you would chide me privately (for you durſt not do it public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) for not voting for you, though hired. I would ſay, how do you know that? Becauſe, ſay you, I have not one vote, <hi>(for remember, if you had but one vote, I would lay claim to it.)</hi> and therefore not yours. What, not one vote! I would exclaim, No, not one; ſay you. Well then, I would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I have the comfort to think I am no worſe than others: This will teach you to come hither again to buy votes, Beſides, if I had voted for you, others might have claimed, with you, the merit of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Spen.</hi> In your country they vote in the open manner you commend. What is the conſequence? Why the Miniſtry tells you it is neceſſary to have a majority on their ſide for the diſpatch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which amounts to the ſame thing as pleading for no parliament at all. A majority therefore is procured, in a very honourable way no doubt. ſhe minority not being bought (for a majority is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient) take every opportunity to ſhew their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by oppoſing all buſineſs indiſcriminately, whether right or wrong. Indeed they have often but too much reaſon to oppoſe, yet let their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues be ever ſo violent, they can never make the majority underſtand in any other way than the Miniſter would have them; for they are too faſt aſleep in the lap of corruption, to regard either their arguments or the praiſes of their country. Thus you ſee the weak influence of fame, which you build ſo much on, even among ſenators; what ſtrength muſt it then have among the poor free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders and burghers, after ſo glorious an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample!</p>

Then would your controverſies about this, and the other way of cobling, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally agitate you, be done away; and you would walk along the rugged and dirty path of life eaſy and dry-ſhod.</p>
               <p>And now you ſhall witneſs with your own eyes, that force is likely to ſucceed as ill againſt us as ſecret corruption. Therefore you muſt go with me to-moorow, a few miles off, it being a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral review day, when the inhabitants of ſeveral pariſhes together are to go through their military exerciſe, under the eye of a general, provided by the ſtate. Every pariſh, or ward of a pariſh, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves at their own convenience; but two or three times a year, ſeveral pariſhes are affembled together, as I ſaid, to accuſtom themſelves to act in large bodies, as you will ſee to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Accordingly next morning we were rouſed early by the drums all over the country beating to arms. No man lagged behind that was able to march: but my friend, luckily for me, happened to be lame, yet not ſo as to prevent his hobbling there to be a ſpectator. I was a ſtranger, and therefore had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them; and ſo went with my friend alſo to look on. The morning was exceeding fine, the military ground was ſpacious, and kept always in paſturage for that purpoſe. The pariſhes, in different liveries, came marching in from every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, with artillery, banners, and muſic. Thoſe who had good horſes, were horſemen; and formed into troops according to the colour of their horſes. The very boys too were furn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhed with ſmall arms, and claſſed according to their ſizes. It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to behold ſo many thouſand citizen ſoldiers in arms only of defence; an army of <q>men, who their duties know, and know their rights; and, knowing, dare maintain.</q> In ſhort, they made
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0127200302:214"/>a gallant appearance, and every one was adorned with what little ornament his rank and uniform admitted of; as medals received for improvements, public ſervices, &amp;c. Every eye ſparkled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and every countenance was expreſſive of happineſs, for this is their moſt agreeable ſport Emulative obedience to command, and dexterity of action, was every where conſpicuous. What contributed much to this, was, that nothing but eminent merit can advance any to be officers, who muſt paſs through every ſtation to the higheſt, if their merit can carry them ſo far. They went through their ſeveral manceuvres like veterans, but the boys in particular made a pleaſing ſight. No play whatever gives them ſuch delight as this military exerciſe, which they apply to with ſuch diligence, that before they leave ſchool, or are fit for other employments, they are as complete there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as the oldeſt. For this purpoſe all due encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is given them; a particular inſtance of which appeared at this time: They made a mock fight with the men and drove them off the ground, which cloſe the review. Every party then with colours flying as they came, marched to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective homes, to ſpend the remainder of the day in feſtivity and joy.</p>
               <p>The merry bells now ſounded from every ſteeple. The glad females, after feaſting their manly ſpouſes and paramours, prepared for the dance; and thro' the evening, revelled in pleaſures known to love and innocence alone. Among other ſports, there were ſhooting matches and cudgel playing, which are favourite diverſons, and encouraged, on ſuch days as this, by medals from the pariſhes. The victors are very proud of theſe medals, and, as obſerved before, wear them on extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and field days.</p>
               <p>I can never enought admire the beauty of the country. It has more the air of a garden, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0127200302:215"/>a paradiſe than a gencral country ſcene; and indeed it is only a continuation of gardens and orchards. For beſides the infinite number of real gardens, the very fields, meadows and paſtures, are plentifully ſtrewed with fruit trees, and the corn is cuitivated in rows. and as carefully as garden herbs. The houſes and every thing about them are ſo amiably neat, and ſo indicative of domeſtic happineſs, ſo far diſtant from the inſlated pomp and ghaſtly ſolemnity of the palaces of the great, and the confined, miſerable depreſſion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of the wretched, that they ſeem the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of rational be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>On expreſſing my ſurprize at ſo much private felicity and public convenience, my friend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "The pariſhes build and repair houſes, make roads, plant hedges and trees, and in a word do all the buſineſs of a Landlord. And you have ſeen what ſort of Landlords they are. I ſuppoſe you do not meet with much to repair or improve, And it is no wonder, for a pariſh has many heads to contrive what ought to be done. Inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating about mending the ſtate, as with you, (for ours needs no mending) we employ our ingenuity nearer home, and the reſult of our debates are in every pariſh, how we ſhall work ſuch a mine, make ſuch a river navigable, drain ſuch a fen, or improve ſuch a waſte. Theſe things we are all immediately intereſted in, and have each a vote in executing; and thus we are not mere ſpectators in the world, but as all men ought to be, actors, and that only for our own benefit."</p>
               <p>The next day following we commenced again our political converſation, as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spen.</hi> Now our whole country is trained and peopled as you have ſeen, I therefore ſuppoſe you

Nay, we will not ſuffer any law in the leaſt impolitic, to give us uneaſineſs long; for we are too knowing and too powerful to be impoſed upon or brow-beat; which makes our Parliament very careful how they make laws.</p>
               <p>Auth. <hi>I must indeed own that you have no great reaſon to be afraid of any encroachment on your consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, whilst you continue your two guardian angels; I mean</hi> VOTING BY BALLOT, <hi>and</hi> THE UNIVERSAL U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spen.</hi> So you think that the unreaſoning deſires of wayward individuals ſhould be complied with, to the detriment of a whole people? Private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in land, is either juſt, according to the law of nature, or it is not. That it is not, is evident from the unnatural and oppreſſive conſequences flowing from it. If all tyranny, and abuſes in government, flow only from that monopolizing ſyſtem, it muſt, of courſe, be the fountain head of tyranny; ſearch hiſtory, and ſee, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every country ever was, and is, in the proprietors of land. If then the people wiſh to have the government in their own hands, they muſt begin firſt, by taking the land into their own hands.</p>
               <p>Who is the Lord Paramount of the univerſe? Is he not God? He then, and he alone, or thoſe whom he deputes, muſt have the rents. Now the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ipture ſays, that the has given the earth to the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0127200302:217"/>children of men; given it to mankind in common Then mankind in their reſpective diſtricts are his ſubſtitutes and repreſentatives, and have a right to receive, and diſpoſe of the revenues ariſing from the Domains, which he in his providence permits them ſeverally to poſſeſs. Some will ſay, that though God gave the earth to the chidren of men, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they may have private poſſeſſions. I anſwer, yes; if they live far, I mean <hi>very far,</hi> aſunder. But in no populous country, ſince the beginning of the world, was private property in land enjoyed, but to the detriment of multitudes of the ſame community: Suppoſe a populous country were divided equally among the inhabitants, as was the land of Canaan among the Iſraelites, how long would their ſhares continue equal? In a few years ſome men's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies would increaſe and others decreaſe, which would ſcon produce inequality of eſtates, even though neither the right of primogeniture nor alienation of property were allowed. Thoſe who became heirs to thoſe decreaſed families, would become richer; and thoſe who had but a ſmall ſhare among many brethren, of their paternal inheritance would become poorer; and even a periodical jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee would not prevent injuſtice and inequality. But, by ſharing the rents, man's equal rights and dignity is preſerved, in every generation, and in every ſtate of population. If God be juſt he muſt approve of ſo juſt and impartial a ſyſtem. We preſume that he is ſo, and that he is not diſpleaſed at his revenues, being diſpoſed of ſo much to the happineſs of mankind.</p>
               <p>We then admit but of ONE LORD, as we do of ONE GOD; and in his name our rents are collected and diſpoſed of as we believe, according to his will and pleaſure. We do not murmer, as you ſuppoſe, at paying rent: How ſhould we, when we conſider for whoſe uſe it is? Does not the ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> paid here, ſerve inſtead of taxes and rates of ever
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0127200302:218"/>deſcription and is it not wholly at our own d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal? And when the public eſtabliſhments are provided for, is not the remainder divided equally among us? If when premiſes become vacant by death, or otherwiſe, they be let to the beſt bidder; is not that the faireſt way? It ſhews no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and prevents colluſion to the prejudice of the public.</p>
               <p>And do you think that the people, while a man lives and pays his rent, will be ſo ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as turn him out of his houſe or farm? No—To prevent families indeed, from looking on their tenements as hereditary, the public may think it prudent, at the deceaſe of a man, or his widow, to take again their property into their own hands, and diſpoſe of it again to the beſt bidder. And what juſt reaſons will the ſons have to complain? Are they not part of that public, whoſe intereſt every man ought to promote and be jealous of for his own ſake? But to prevent all colour of injuſtice, on account of improvements, medals and premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums are always beſtowed on thoſe, while they live, who remarkably improve the public property. Your European landlords give no ſuch rewards nor ſhew ſuch favour, on account of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that you need to ſurmiſe ſo many idle grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances under a ſyſtem of purity ſufficient for the heavens.</p>
               <p>I could not, in my heart, teaze my friend any further, with my frivolous objections; for I was fully convinced that, if ever there be a millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium or heaven upon earth, it can only exiſt under the <hi>benign</hi> SYSTEM of SPENSONIA.</p>
               <p>The wiſe and beneficient regulations and lawse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating from this ſyſtem of ſimplicity are beyond conception, beautiful and conducive of public happineſs. Many inſtances might be given, which, other ſocieties, not built on the public good, can
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0127200302:219"/>never adopt. For example: If any man poſſeſs an invention, or ſecret, in medicine, or other ſcience, or art, of importance to mankind, the ſtate does not firſt tax the poſſeſſor by ſelling him a patent, and then load his manufactures with ſtamps and duties, thereby counteracting as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the kind intentions of the deity, in bleſſing his creatures with ſuch an invention. No: the parliament is <hi>obleged</hi> to purchaſe the ſecret, and publiſh it. Remember, I ſay, <hi>obliged;</hi> for as it is only for purpoſes evidently uſeful, that their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment dare diſpoſe of the public money, at all, ſo neither dare they be ſparing, when public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity demands it. Thus no quacks or impoſters, under pretence of ſecrets, are ſuffered to impoſe on mankind, to ruin their healths, or pick their pockets. Neither does any complain, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, or his labours have been unrewarded, through all the <hi>happy regions of</hi> SPENSONIA.</p>

               <head type="sub">(From the Analytical Review for March, 1792.)</head>
               <p>COURTEOUS reader, we announce to thee, the publication of the Second part of the Rights of Man. Wert thou pleaſed with the firſt part? Thou wilt be delighted with the ſecond. Didſt thou ſay of the former, ſuch a work deſerves no other conſutation than that of criminal juſtice? Thou wilt ſay of this, the only way to anſwer it is to hang the author.</p>
               <p>For our parts, we wiſh neither to kindle thy hopes, nor to provoke thy horrors. Lo! we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce thee to the author, and leave thoe and him to ſettle the proper mode of confutation. Only keep your tempers. We will ſit by; and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewers of the controverſy, will occaſionally break ſilence. We will alſo take the liberty of dropping at the cloſe a few remarks, to qualify your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, if you ſhould chance to diſagree.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt perceive, reader, at the outſet, that Mr. P: ſo far from thinking he has received any defeat from the replies made to his former publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conceives himſelf to ſtand on an eminence, aſſerts a victory, and claims a triumph. p. vii.</p>
               <p>'Several other reaſons contributed to produce this determination (of deferring the remainder of his work.) I wiſhed to know the manner in which a work, written in a ſtyle of thinking and expreſſion different to what had been cuſtomary in England, would be received before I proceeded farther. A great field was opening to the view of mankind by means of the French Revolution. Mr. Burke's outrageous oppoſition thereto brought the controverſy into England. He attacked prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which he knew (from information) I would conteſt with him, becauſe they are principles I believe to be good, and which I have contributed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0127200302:225"/>to eſtabliſh, and conceive myſelf bound to defend, Had he not urged the controverſy, I had moſt probably been a ſilent man.</p>
               <p>'Another reaſon was, that Mr. Burke promiſed in his firſt publication to renew the ſubject at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity, and to make a compariſon of what he called the Engliſh and French Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I therefore held myſelf in reſerve for him, He has publiſhed two works ſince, without doing this; which he certainly would not have omitted, had the compariſon been in his favour.</p>
               <p>'In his laſt work, <hi>"His appeal from the new to the old Whigs,"</hi> he has quoted about ten pages from the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> and having given himſelf the trouble of doing this, ſays, <q>he ſhall not attempt in the ſmalleſt degree to refute them,</q> meaning the principles therein contained. I am enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. Burke to know, that he would if he could. But inſtead of conteſting them, he immediately after conſoles himſelf with ſaying, that "he has done his part."—He has not done his part. He has not performed his promiſe of a compariſon of conſtitutions. He ſtarted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, he gave the challenge, and has fled from it; and he is now a <hi>caſe in point</hi> with his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that, <hi>"the age of chivalry is gone!"</hi>
               </p>

To put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhelter of other men's authority, as Mr. Burke has done, ſerves to bring them into ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Mr. Burke is not very fond of dividing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s honours, but in this caſe he is artfully dividing the diſgrace.</p>
               <p>'But who are thoſe to whom Mr. Burke has made his appeal? A ſet of childiſh thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kers and half-way politicians born in the laſt century; men who went no farther with any principle than as it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0127200302:226"/>ſuited their purpoſe as a party; the nation was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leſt out of the queſtion; and this has been the character of every party from that day to this. The nation ſees nothing in ſuch works, or ſuch politics worthy its attention. A little matter will move a party, but it muſt be ſomething great that moves a nation.</p>
               <p>'Though I ſee nothing in Mr. Burke's Appeal worth taking notice of, there is, however, one expreſſion upon which I ſhall offer a few remarks. After quoting largely from the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> and declining to conteſt the principles contained in that work, he ſays, <q>this will moſt probably be done <hi>(if ſuch writings shall be thought to deſerve any other refutation than that of criminal juſtice)</hi> by others, who may think with Mr. Burke, and with the ſame zeal,</q>
               </p>
               <p>'In the firſt place, it has not yet been done by any body. Not leſs I believe, than eight or ten pamphlets intended as anſwers to the former part of the "Rights of Man" have been publiſhed by different perſons, and not one of them, to my knowledge, has extended to a ſecond edition, nor are even the titles of them ſo much as generally remembered. As I am averſe to unneceſſarily mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying publications, I have anſwered none of them. And as I believe that a man may write himſelf out of reputation when nobody elſe can do it, I am careful to avoid that rock.</p>
               <p>'But as I would decline unneceſſary publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the one hand, ſo would I avoid every thing that might appear like ſullen pride on the other. If Mr, Burke, or any other perſon on his ſide the queſtion, will produce an anſwer to the "Rights of Man," that ſhall extend to an half, or even to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights of Man extended, I will reply to his work. But untill this be done, I ſhall ſo far take the ſenſe of the public for my guide, (and the world knows
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0127200302:227"/>I am not a flatterer) that what they do not think worth while to read, is not worth mine to anſwer, I ſuppoſe the number of copies to which the firſt part of the <hi>Rights of Man</hi> extended, taking En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Scotland, and fieland, is not leſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween forty and fifty thouſand.</p>
               <p>Mr. P. taking the common notion of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Engliſh conſtitution (Mr. P. will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our uſing that expreſſion) to be fallacious, and aiming to prepare his readers for remarks on its imperfections, proceeds as follows. P. XIV.</p>
               <p>'As to the prejudices which men have from education and habit, in favour of any particular form or ſyſtem of government, thoſe prejudices have yet to ſtand the teſt of reaſon and reflection. In fact, ſuch prejudices are nothing. No man is prejudiced in favour of a thing, knowing it to be wrong. He is attached to it on the belief of its being right; and when he ſees it is not ſo, the prejudice will be gone. We have but a defective idea of what prejudice is. It might be ſaid, that until men think for themſelves the whole is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and <hi>not opinion;</hi> for that only is opinion which is the reſult of reaſon and reflection. I offer this remark, that Mr. Burke may not conſide too much in what has been the cuſtomary preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the country.</p>
               <p>'I do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and candidly dealt by. They have been impoſed upon by parties, and by men aſſuming the character of leaders. It is time that the nation ſhould riſe above thoſe trifles. It is time to diſmiſs that inattention which has ſo long been the encouraging cauſe of ſtretching taxation to exceſs. It is time to diſmiſs all thoſe ſongs and toaſts which are calculated to enſlave, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to ſuffocate reflection. On all ſuch ſubjects men have but to think, and they will neither act wrong, nor be miſled. To ſay that any people are
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0127200302:228"/>not fit for freedom, is to make poverty their choice, and to ſay they had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If ſuch a caſe could be proved, it would equally prove, that thoſe who govern are not fit to govern them, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>'But admiſſing government <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be done without convulſion or revenge. It is not worth making changes or revolations, unleſs it be for ſo ne great national benefit; and when this ſhall appear to a nation, the danger will be, as in America and France, to thoſe who oppoſe.'</p>
               <p>Speaking of the expectations to be formed from the prevailing bias towards revolutions in different nations, our author of ſerves, P. 4.</p>
               <p>'As revolutions have begun, (and as the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is always greater againſt a thing beginning than of proceeding after it has begun), it is natural to expect that other revolutions will follow. The amazing and ſtill encreaſing expences with which old governments are conducted, the numerous wars they engage in or provoke, the embarraſſments they throw in the way of univerſal civilization and commerce, and the oppreſſion and uſurpation they act at home have wearied out the patience, and exhauſted the property of the world. In ſuch a ſituation, and with the examples already exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revolutions are to be looked for. They are become ſubjects of univerſal converſation, and may be conſidered as the <hi>Order of the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'If ſyſtems of government can be introduced, leſs expenſive, and more productive of general happineſs, than thoſe which have exiſted, all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to oppoſe their progreſs will in the end be fruitleſs. Reaſon, like time, will make its own way, and prejudice will fall in a combat with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. If univerſal peace, civilization, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, are ever to be the happy lot of man, it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0127200302:229"/>cannot be accompliſhed but by a revolution in the ſyſtem of governments. All the monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are military. War is their trade, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and revenue their objects. While ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments continue, peace has not the abſolute ſecurity of a day. What is the hiſtory of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical governments, but a diſguſtful picture of human wretchedneſs, and the accidental reſpite of a few years repoſe? Wearied with war, and tired with human butchery, they ſat down to reſt, and called it peace. This certainly is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that Heaven intended for man; and if <hi>this be monarchy,</hi> well might monarchy be reckoned among the ſins of the Jews.</p>
               <p>'The revolutions which formerly took place in the world, had nothing in them that intereſted the bulk of mankind. They extended only to a change of perſons and meaſures, but not of principles, and roſe or ſell among the common transactions of the moment. What we now behold, may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called a <hi>"counter revolution"</hi> Conqueſt and tyranny, at ſome early period, diſpoſſeſſed man of his rights, and he is now recovering them. And as the tide of all human affairs has its ebb and flow in directions contrary to each other, ſo alſo is it in this. Government ſounded on a <hi>moral theory, on a ſyſtem of univerſal peace, on the indefea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hereditary Rights of Man,</hi> is now revolving from weſt to eaſt, by a ſtronger impulſe than the government of the ſword revolved from eaſt to weſt. It intereſts not particular individuals, but nations, in its progreſs, and promiſes a new aera to the human race.'</p>
               <p>This work is divided into five chapters, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarks on ſociety and civilization—on the origin of the preſent old Governments (among the old governments comes poor old England)—on the old and new ſyſtems of governments—on conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0127200302:230"/>ways and means of improving the condition of Europe.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the chapter on civilization, we cannot help expreſſing our admiration of many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which betray great political capacity, and much originality of thought. Mr. Paine ſuppoſes, from the intereſt men have in ſociety, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which a formal government has any real benefit are few, and that the more perfect civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation is, the ſeſs occaſion there is for government. Our author obſerves, P. 11.</p>
               <p>'If we look back to the riots and tumults, which at various times have happened in England, we ſhall find, that they did not proceed from the want of a government, but that government was itſelf the generating cauſe; inſtead of conſolidating ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, it divided it: it deprived it of its natural coheſion, aud engendered diſcontents and diſorders, which otherwiſe would not have exiſted. In thoſe aſſociations which men promiſcuouſly form for the purpoſe of trade, or of any concern, in which government is totally out of the queſtion, and in which they act merely on the principles of ſociety, we ſee how naturally the various parties unite; and this ſhews, by compariſon, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, ſo far from being always the cauſe or means of order, are often the deſtruction of it. The riots of 1780 had no other ſource than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of thoſe prejudices, which the government itſelf had encouraged. But with reſpect to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland there are alſo other cauſes.</p>
               <p>'Exceſs and inequality of taxation, however diſguiſed in the means, never fail to appear in their effects. As a great maſs of the community are thrown hereby into poverty and diſcontent, they are conſtantly on the brink of commotion; and deprived, as they unfortunately are, of the means of information are eaſily heated to outrage. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the apparent cauſe of any riots may be, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0127200302:231"/>real one is always want of happineſs. It ſhews that ſomething is wrong in the ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that injures the felicity by which ſociety is to be preſerved.</p>
               <p>In ſpeaking of the origin of the old governments, Mr. P. traces monarchy to a banditti of Ruffians! Do but hear him! p. 15.</p>
               <p>'It is impoſſible that ſuch governments as have hitherto exiſted in the world, could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced by any other means than a total violation of every principle ſacred and moral. The obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in which the origin of all the preſent old go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments is buried, implies the iniquity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with which they began. The origin of the preſent government of America and France will ever be remembered, becauſe it is honourable to record it; but with reſpect to the reſt, even flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery has conſigned them to the tomb of time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inſpiration.</p>
               <p>'It could have been no difficult thing in the early and ſolitary ages of the world, while the chief employment of men was that of attending flocks and herds, for a banditti of ruffians to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run a country, and lay it under contributions. Their power being thus eſtabliſhed, the chief of the band contrived to loſe the name of robber in that of monarch; and hence the origin of monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and kings.</p>
               <p>'The origin of the government of England, ſo far as relates to what is called its line of monarchy, being one of the lateſt, is perhaps the beſt record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The hatred which the Norman invaſion and tyranny begat, muſt have been deeply rooted in the nation, to have outlived the contrivance to obliterate it. Though not a courtier will talk of the curfeu bell, not a village in England has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it.'</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks, however, though they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0127200302:232"/>to moſt of the monarchies which have been eſtabliſhed, will certainly not apply to all,</p>
               <p>When treating on the origin of the old and new ſyſtems of government, our author makes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſevere reflections on hereditary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 21.</p>
               <p>'Government ought to be a thing always in full maturity. It ought to be ſo conſtructed as to be ſuperior to all the accidents to which individual man is ſubject; and therefore, hereditary ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by being <hi>ſubject to them all,</hi> is the moſt irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and imperfect of all the ſyſtems of government.</p>
               <p>'We have heard the <hi>Rights of Man</hi> called a <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling</hi> ſyſtem; but the only ſyſtem to which the word <hi>levelling</hi> is truly applicable, is the hereditary monarchical ſyſtem. It is a ſyſtem of <hi>mental level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> It indiſcriminately admits every ſpecies of character to the ſame authority. Vice and virtue. ignorance and wiſdom, in ſhort, every quality, good or bad, is put on the ſame level. Kings ſucceed each other, not as ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ionals, but as ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. It ſignifies not what their mental or moral characters are. Can we then be ſurprited at the abject ſtate of the human mind in monarchial countries, when the government itſelf is formed on ſuch an abject levelling ſyſtem?—It has no fixed character. To day it is one thing; to-morrow it is ſomething elſe. It changes with the temper of every ſucceeding individual, and is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bject to all the varieties of eaeh. It is government through the medium of paſſions and accident. It appears under all the various characters of childhood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitude, dotage, a thing at nurſe, in leading-ſtrings, or in crutches. It reverſes the wholeſome order of nature. It occaſionally puts children over men, and the conceits of non-age over wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and experience. In ſhort, we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more ridiculous figure of government, than hereditary ſucceſſion, in all its caſes preſents.</p>

               <p>In ſpeaking on the tendency of elective govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, many political writers have ſpoken of them as the cauſe of civil wars. Mr. Paine on the other hand contends, that civil wars, which have origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from conteſted hereditary claims, are more numerous, and have been more dreadful, and of longer continuance, than thoſe which have been occaſioned by elective governments. Mr. Paine's views here correſpond to the reflections made on the ſame ſubject by the illuſtrious ſufferer Algernon Sidney.</p>
               <p>One hardly can help ſmiling at the following remark, p. 36.</p>
               <p>'Whether I have too little ſenſe to ſee, or too much to be impoſed upon; whether I have too much or too little pride, or of any thing elſe, I leave out of the queſtion; but certain it is, that what is called monarchy, always appears to me a filly, contemptible thing. I compare it to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing kept behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of buſtle and fuſs, and a wonderful air of ſeeming ſolemnity; but when, by any accident, the curtain happens to be opened, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſee what it is, they burſt into laughter.'</p>
               <p>Whether the remark be true or falſe, we do not determine; <hi>fed riſum teneatis amici?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thoſe which follow be all true, however, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0127200302:234"/>as we were to ſmile, we could not avoid being grave. p. 38.</p>
               <p>'That monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money, is evident (at leaſt to me), in every character in which it can be viewed. It would be impoſſible, on the rational ſyſtem of repreſentative government, to make out a bill of expences to ſuch an enormous amount as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception admits. Government is not of itſelf a very chargeable inſtitution. The whole expence of the federal government of America, founded, as I have already ſaid, on the ſyſtem of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and extending over a country ten times as large as England, is but ſix hundred thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, or one hundred and thirty-five thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>
               <p>'I preſume, that no man in his ſober ſenſes, will compare the character of any of the kings of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope with that of General Waſhington. Yet, in France, and alſo in England, the expence of the civil liſt only, for the ſupport of one man, is eight times greater than the whole expence of the federal government in America. To aſſign a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this, appears almoſt impoſſible. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of people in America, eſpecially the poor, are more able to pay taxes, than the generality of people either in France or England.</p>
               <p>'But the caſe is, that the repreſentative ſyſtem diffuſes ſuch a body of knowledge throughout a nation, on the ſubject of government, as to explode ignorance, and preclude impoſition. The craft of courts cannot be acted on that ground. There is no place for myſtery; no where for it to begin. Thoſe who are not in the repreſentation, know as much of the nature of buſineſs as thoſe who are. An affectation of myſterious importance would there be ſcouted. Nations can have no, ſecrets; and the ſecrets of courts, like thoſe of individuals, are always their defects.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0127200302:235"/>'Our author, after ſtating the manner in which America proceeded in forming her conſtitution, ſtill inſiſts on what he had formerly advanced, viz. that England has no conſtitution. Whether truly or no, we leave others to decide. We will juſt quote a word or two on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>'In England, (p. 50. 51.) it is not difficult to perceive that every thing has a conſtitution, except the nation. Every ſociety and aſſociation that is eſtabliſhed, firſt agreed upon a number of original articles, digeſted into form, which are its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. It then appointed its officers, whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and authorities are deſeribed in that conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the government of that ſociety then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. Thoſe officers, by whatever name they are called, have no authority to add to, alter, or abridge the original articles. It is only to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting power that this right belongs.</p>
               <p>'From the want of underſtanding the difference between a conſtitution and a government, Dr. Johnſon, and all writers of his deſcription, have always bewildered themſelves. They could not but perceive, that there muſt neceſſarily be a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling</hi> power exiſting ſomewhere, and they placed this power in the diſcretion of the perſons exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the government, inſtead of placing it in a conſtitution formed by the nation. When it is in a conſtitution, it has the nation for its ſupport, and the natural and the political countrouling powers are together. The laws which are enacted by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, countroul men only as individuals, but the nation, through its conſtitution, countrouls the whole government, and has a natural ability ſo to do. The final controuling power, therefore, and the original conſtituting power, are one and the ſame power.'</p>
               <p>Having, as he thinks, demoliſhed the doctrine of an 'Engliſh conſtitution,' he then drops a word or two on precedents, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0127200302:236"/>'In numerous inſtances, he ſays (P. 58.) the precedent ought to operate as a warning, and not as an example, and requires to be ſhunned inſtead of imitated; but inſtead of this, precedents are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the lump, and put at once for conſtitution and for law.</p>
               <p>'Either the doctrine of precedents is policy to keep a man in a ſtate of ignorance or is it a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical confeſſion that wiſdom degenerates in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as governments increaſe in age, and can only hobble along by the ſtilts and crutches of precedents. How is it that the ſame perſons who would proudly be thought wiſer than their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, appear at the ſame time only as the ghoſts of departed wiſdom? How ſtrangely is antiquity treated! To anſwer ſome purpoſes it is ſpoken of as the times of darkneſs and ignorance, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer others, it is put for the light of the world.</p>
               <p>'If the doctrine of precedents is to be followed, the expences of government need not continue the ſame. Why pay men extravagantly, who have but little to do? If every thing that can happen is already in precedent, legiſlation is at an end, and precedent, like a dictionary, determines every caſe. Either, therefore, government has arrived at its dotage, and requires to be renovated, or all the occaſions for exerciſing its wiſdom have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.'</p>

               <p>'When extraordinary power and extraordinary pay are allotted to any individnal in a government, he becomes the center, round which every kind of corruption generates and forms. Give to any man a million a year, and add thereto the power of creating and diſpoſing of places, at the expence of a country, and the liberties of that country are no longer ſecure. What is called the ſplendor of a throne is no other than the corruption of the ſtate. It is made up of a band òf paraſites, living in luxurious indolence, out of the public taxes.</p>
               <p>'When once ſuch a vicious ſyſtem is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it becomes the guard and protection of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior abuſes.

It is always his intereſt to defend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior abuſes, as ſo many out-works to protect the citadel; and in this ſpecies of political fortification, all the parts have ſuch a common dependence that it is never to be expected they will attack each other <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>'It is ſcarcely poſſible to touch on any ſubject that will not ſuggeſt an alluſion to ſome corruption in governments. The ſimile of "fortifications," unfortunately involves with it a circumſtance, which is directly in point with the matter above alluded to.</p>
                     <p>'Among the numerous inſtances of abuſe which have been acted or protected by governments, ancient or modern, there is not a greater than that of quartering a man and his heirs upon the public, to be maintained at its expence.</p>
                     <p>'Humanity dictates a proviſion for the poor; but by what right, moral or political, does any government aſſume to ſay, that the perſon called the Duke of Richmond, ſhall he maintained by the public? Yet, if common report is true, not a beggar in London can purchaſe his wretched pittance of coal, without paying towards the civil liſt of the Duke of Richmond. Were the whole produce of this impoſition but a ſhilling a year, the iniquitous principle would be ſtill the ſame; but when it amounts, as it is ſaid to do, to not leſs than twenty thouſand pounds per ann. the enormity is too ſerious to be permitted to remain.—This is one of the effects of monarchy and ariſtocracy.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0127200302:239"/>In remarking on what Mr. Burke ſaid relative to the Houſe of Peers, the following fact is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which Mr. Paine calls a fact not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled in the hiſtory of taxation.</p>
               <p>P. 100. 'Notwithſtanding taxes have encreaſed and multiplied upon every article of common conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the land tax, which more particularly affects this 'pillar' has diminiſhed. In 1788, the amount of the land-tax was 1,950,000<hi>l.</hi> which is half a million leſs than it produced almoſt an hundred years ago <note n="†" place="bottom">'See Sir John Sinclair's Hiſtory of the Revenue.' The land tax in 1646 was 2,473,499l.</note>, notwithſtanding the rentals are in many inſtances doubled ſince that period.</p>
               <p>'Before the coming of the Hanoverians, the taxes were divided in nearly èqual proportions between the land and articles of conſumption, the land bearing rather the largeſt ſhare; but ſince that aera, nearly thirteen millions annually of new taxes have been thrown upon conſumption. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which has been a conſtant encreaſe in the number and wretchedneſs of the poor, and in the amount of the poor-rates. Yet here again the burthens does not fall in equal proportions on the ariſtocracy with the reſt of the community. Their reſidences, whether in town or country, are not mixed with the habitations of the poor. They live apart from diſtreſs, and the expence of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. It is in manufacturing towns and labouring villages that thoſe burthens preſs the heavieſt; in many of which it is one claſs of poor ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another.</p>
               <p>'Several of the moſt heavy and productive taxes are ſo contrived, as to give an exemption to this pillar, thus ſtanding in its own defence. The tax upon beer brewed for ſale does not affect the ariſtocracy, who brew their own beer free of this duty. It falls only on thoſe who have not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency or ability to brew, and who muſt purchaſe it in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0127200302:240"/>ſmall quantities. But what will mankind think of the juſtice of taxation, when they know, that this tax alone, from which the ariſtocracy are from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances exempt, is nearly equal to the whole of the land-tax, being in the year 1788, and it is not leſs now, than 1, 666, 152<hi>l.</hi> and with its proportion of the taxes on malt and hops, it exceeds it.—That a ſingle article, thus partially conſumed, and that chiefly by the working part, ſhould be ſubject to a tax, equal to that on the whole rental of a nation, is, perhaps, a fact not to be parelleled in the hiſtories of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.'</p>
               <p>'The taxes levied by William the Conqueror, beginning in the year 1066, were 400,000<hi>l.</hi>—In the year 1466 they had decreaſed to 100,000. Five hundred years after the conqueſt (1566) the annual amount of taxes was 500,000<hi>l.</hi> Annual amount of taxes in 1791, 17,000,000<hi>l.</hi> excluſive of the expence of collection, and the drawbacks, which are nearly 2,000,000<hi>l.</hi> more.' The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt 400 years and the laſt three, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues Mr. P. is ſo aſtoniſhing as to warrant an opinion that the national character of the Engliſh has changed. About 9,000,000<hi>l.</hi> of this ſum is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to pay the intereſt of the national debt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paine ſuppoſes, from a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances taken together, that the annual expenditure might be fixed at 1,500,000<hi>l.</hi> The ſurplus of more than 6,000,000<hi>l.</hi> out of the preſent current expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he ſuppoſes, might be diſpoſed of as follows. The poor rates might be aboliſhed, and in lieu of them a remiſſion of taxes might be made to the poor of double the amount of thoſe rates out of the ſurplus taxes. By which means the poor would be benefited 20,000<hi>l.</hi> and the houſekeepers 20,000<hi>l</hi> This remiſſion he ſuppoſes to be applied to the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of poor children, and the ſupport of old people paſt their labour; to the education of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a claſs of people, who, though not ſtrictly
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0127200302:241"/>poor, are incapable of giving their children educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: to the relief of workmen (making the demand) on the birth of a child, and of every new married couple claiming in like manner; and 20.000<hi>l.</hi> to defray the funeral expences of perſons who, travelling for work, die at a diſtance from their friends; 20,000<hi>l.</hi> to what he calls 'a world of little caſes,' ariſing particularly in London. To make up the deficiency, neceſſary to ſupply the demand of theſe caſes, he propoſes to add 20,000<hi>l.</hi> the tax laid on coals in London, 'ſo iniquitouſly and wantonly applied to the ſupport of the Duke of Richmond. The ſum of 2,000,000<hi>l.</hi> of the current expences, Mr. Paine wonld apply as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: 117,000<hi>l.</hi> to the relief of diſbanded ſoldiers; additional pay to the remaining ſoldiers 19,500<hi>l.</hi> To the officers of the diſbanded corps 117,000<hi>l.</hi> to the diſbanded navy the ſame ſum, amounting to 253,500<hi>l.</hi> the total 507,000<hi>l.</hi>; he alſo propoſes, that as any part of this half million falls in, part of the taxes may be taken off. There now remain at leaſt one million and an half of ſurplus taxes: he therefore propoſes that the tax on houſes and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows may be taken off, amounting to 516, 299<hi>l.</hi> 6<hi>s.</hi> 0<hi>d.</hi> ¼, and the ſurplus of 10,000<hi>l.</hi> of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus taxes to be kept in reſerve for incidental mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>In this plan of reform Mr. Paine propoſes, that the commutation tax may be taken off, and that there be ſubſtituted in its room a tax on eſtates, ſo regulated as to deſtroy the unnatural law of primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture, ſo fruitful of corruptions at elections.</p>
               <p>Our author alſo propoſes, that the laws regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing workmens wages ſhould be aboliſhed, and the yet remaining ſum of ſurplus taxes (10000<hi>l.</hi>) he propoſes to be applied to increaſe the ſalary of the inferior revenue officers, and of the inferior clergy.</p>

               <p>p. 162.

On this point the old government of France was ſuperior to the preſent government of England, becauſe, on extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions, recourſe could be had to what was then called the States General: But in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land there are no ſuch occaſional bodies; and as to thoſe who are now called Repreſentatives, a great part of them are mere machines of the court, placemen, and dependants.</p>
               <p>'I preſume, that though all the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land pay taxes, not an hundreth part of them are electors, and the members of one of the houſes of parliament repreſent nobody but themſelves. There is, therefore, no power but the voluntary will of the people that has a right to act in any matter reſpecting a general reform; and by the ſame right that two perſons can confer on ſuch a ſubject, a thouſand may. The object, in all ſuch prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proceedings, is to find out what the general ſenſe of a nation is, and to be governed by it. If it prefer a bad or defective government to a reform, or chuſe to pay ten times more taxes than there is occaſion for, it has a right ſo to do; and ſo long as the majority do not impoſe conditions on the minority, different from what they impoſe on themſelves, though there may be much error, there is no injuſtice. Neither will the error continue

               <p>THE univerſal God of nature,—the Saviour of mankind,—the fountain of all light, who came to pluck the world from eternal darkneſs, expired upon a croſs, the ſcoff of infidel ſcorn; and his bleſſed apoſtles followed him in the train of Martyrs. When he came in the fleſh, he might have come like the Mahometan prophet, as a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſovereign, and propagated that religion with an unconquerable ſword, which even now, after the lapſe of ages, is but ſlowly moving, under the influence of reaſon, over the face of the earth: But ſuch a proceſs would have been inconſiſtent with his miſſion, which was to confound the pride, and to eſtabliſh the univerſal rights of men; he came therefore in that lowly ſtate which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0127200302:244"/>in the goſpel, and preached his conſolations to the poor.</p>
               <p>When the foundation of this religion was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be invulnerable and immortal, we had political power taking the church into partnerſhip; thus began the corruptions both of religion and civil power, and, hand in hand together, what havock have they not made in the world; ruling by ignorance and the perſecution of truth; but this very perſecution only haſtened the revival of letters and liberty, which was to deſtroy the one, and to raiſe up the other. Nay, you will find, that in the exact proportion that knowledge and learning have been beat down and fettered, they have deſtroyed the governments that bound them. The court of Star-chamber, the firſt reſtriction of the preſs in England, was erected, previous to all the great changes in the conſtitution. From that moment no man could legally write without an imprimatur from the ſtate; but truth and freedom found their way with greater force through ſecret channels, and the unhappy Charles, unwarned by a free preſs, was brought to an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>When men can freely communicate their thoughts and their ſufferings, real or imaginary, their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſpend themſelves in air, like gunpowder ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the ſurface; but pent up by terrors, they work unfeen, like ſubterraneous fire, burſt forth in earthquake, and deſtroy every thing in their courſe. Let reaſon be oppoſed to reaſon, and argument to argument, and every good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will be ſafe.</p>
               <p>The uſurper, Cromwell, purſued the ſame ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of reſtraint in ſupport of his government, and the end of it ſpeedily followed.</p>
               <p>At the reſtoration of Charles the Second, the Star-chamber ordinance of 1637, was worked up into an act of Parliament, and was followed up during that reign, and the ſhort one that followed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0127200302:245"/>it, by the moſt ſanguinary proſecutions; but what fact in hiſtory is more notorious, than that this blind and contemptible policy prepared and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened on the revolution. At that great aera theſe cobwebs were all bruſhed away: The freedom of the preſs was regenerated, and the country, ruled by its affections, has ſince enjoyed a century of tranquility and glory.—Thus I have maintained, by Engliſh hiſtory, that in proportion as the preſs has been free, Engliſh government has been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will now ſupport the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth by very great authorities. Upon a ſubject of this kind, reſort cannot be had to law-caſes. The ancient law of England know nothing of ſuch libels; they began, and ſhould have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Star-chamber. What writings are ſlanderous of individuals muſt be looked for where theſe proſecutions are recorded; but upon general ſubjects we muſt go to general writers. If indeed, I were to refer to obſcure authors, I might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that my very authorities were libels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of juſtifications or examples; but this cannot be ſaid with effect of great men, whoſe works are claſſics in our language, taught in our ſchools, and printed under the eye of government.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall begin with the poet Milton, a great authority in all learning.—It may be ſaid, indeed, he was a republican, but that would only prove that REPUBLICANISM IS NOT INCOMPATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE WITH VIRTUE; it may be ſaid too, that the work which I cite was written againſt previous licencing, which is not contended for to-day. But in my opinion, if every work is to be adjudged a libel, which is adverſe to the wiſhes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the opinions of thoſe who may try it, the revival of a licencer would be a ſecurity to the public: For, if I preſent my book to a magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate appointed by law, if he rejects it, I have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0127200302:246"/>only to forbear from the publication, and in the forbearance I am ſafe; and he too is anſwerable for the abuſe of his authority. But, upon the argument of to-day, a man muſt print at his peril, without any guide to the principles of judgment, upon which his work may be afterwards proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and condemned. Milton's argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore applies, and was meant to apply, to every interruption to writing, which, while they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the individual, endanger the ſtate.</p>
               <p>"We have them not," ſays Milton, <q>that can be heard of, from any ancient ſtate, or polity, or church, nor by any ſtatute left us by our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, elder or later, nor from the modern cuſtom of any reformed city, abroad; but from the moſt antichriſtian council, and the moſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous inquiſition that ever exiſted. Till then, books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; <hi>the iſſue of the brain was no more ſtifled than the iſſue of the womb.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>To the pure all things are pure; not only meats and drinks, but all kind of knowledge, whether good or evil; the knowledge cannot defile, nor conſequently the books, if the will and conſcience be not defiled.</p>
                  <p>Bad books ſerve in many reſpects to diſcover, to confuſe, to forewarn, and to illuſtrate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of what better witneſs can we expect I ſhould produce, than one of your own, now ſitting in Parliament, the chief of learned men reputed in this land, <hi>Mr, Selden;</hi> whoſe volume of natural and national laws proves, not only by great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities brought together, but by exquiſite reaſons and theorems, almoſt mathematically demonſtrative, that all opinions. yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main ſervice and aſſiſtance toward the ſpeedy attainment of what is trueſt.</p>
                  <p>Opinions and underſtanding are not ſuch
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0127200302:247"/>wares as to be monopolized and traded in by tickets and ſtatutes, and ſtandards. We muſt not think to make a ſtaple commodity of all the knowledge in the land, to mark and licence it, like our broad-cloth, and our wool-packs.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it to the common people leſs than a reproach; for if we be ſo jealous over them, that we cannot truſt them with an Engliſh pamphlet, what do we but cenſure them, for a giddy, vicious, and ungrounded people; in ſuch a ſick and weak eſtate of faith and diſcretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a licencer. That this is care or love of them we cannot pretend.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe corruptions which it ſeeks to prevent, break in faſter at doors which cannot be ſhut.</p>
                  <p>To prevent men thinking and acting for themſelves, by reſtraints on the preſs, is like to the exploits of the gallant man, who, thought to pound up the crows by ſhutting his park gate.</p>
                  <p>This obſtructing violence meets for the moſt part with an event, utterly oppoſite to the end which it drives at: inſtead of ſuppreſſing books, it raiſes them and inveſts them with a reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the puniſhment of wits enhances their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſaith the viſcount St. Albans; and a forbidden writing is thought to be a certain ſpark of truth, that flies up in the face of them who ſeek to tread it out.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He then adverts to his viſit to the famous Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo, whom he found and viſited in the inquiſition, <q>for not thinking in aſtronomy with the Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can and Dominican monks.</q> And what event ought more deeply to intereſt and affect us. The very laws of nature were to bend under the rod of a licencer; this illuſtrious aſtronomer ended his life within the bars of a priſon, becauſe, in ſeeing the phaſes of Venus through his newly invented
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0127200302:248"/>teleſcope, he pronounced, that ſhe ſhone with borrowed light, and from the ſun as the center: that ſun which now inhabits it upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mathematical truth, which enables us to travel the pathleſs ocean, and to carry our line and rule amongſt other worlds, which but for Galileo we had never known, perhaps even to the receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of an infinite and immortal God.</p>
               <p>Milton then, in the moſt eloquent addreſs to the parliament, puts the Liberty of the Preſs on its true and moſt honourable foundation. <q>Believe it Lords and Commons, they who counſel ye to ſuch a ſuppreſſing of books, do as good as bid you ſuppreſs yourſelves; and I will ſoon ſhew how.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If it be deſired to know the immediate cauſe of all this free writing and free ſpeaking, there cannot be aſſigned a truer than your own mild, and free, and humane government; it is the liberty, lords and commons, which your own valourous and happy counſels have purchaſed us; liberty which is the nurſe of all great wits: this is that which hath rarified and enlightened our ſpirits like the influence of Heaven; this is that which hath enfranchiſed, enlarged and lifted up our apprehenſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above themſelves. Ye cannot make us now leſs able, leſs knowing, leſs eagerly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, unleſs ye firſt make yourſelves, that made us ſo leſs the lovers leſs the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ignorant again, brutiſh formal and ſlaviſh, as ye found us; but ye then muſt become that which ye cannot be, oppreſſive, arbitrary and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye freed us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts now more erected to the ſearch and expectation of greateſt and exacteſt things, is the iſſue of your own virtue propagated in us. Give me
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0127200302:249"/>the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conſcience, above all liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will now refer you to another au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whoſe opinion you may think more in point, as having lived in our own times, and as holding the higheſt monarchical principles of government. I ſpeak of Mr. Hume, who, nevertheleſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that this liberty of the preſs extends not only to abſtract ſpeculation, but to keep the public on their guard againſt all the acts of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>After ſhewing the advantages of a monarchy to public freedom, provided it is duly controlled and watched by the popular part of the conſtitution; lie ſays, <q>Theſe principles account for the great liberty of the preſs in theſe kingdoms, beyond what is indulged in any other government. It is apprehended, that arbitrary power would ſteal in upon us, were we not careful to prevent its progreſs, and were there not an eaſy method of conveying the alarm from one end of the kingdom to the other. <hi>The ſpirit of the people muſt frequently be rouſed, in order to curb the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the court;</hi> and the dread of rouſing this ſpirit muſt be employed to prevent that ambition. Nothing is ſo effectual to this purpoſe, as the liberty of the preſs, by which all the learning, wit, and genius of the nation, may be employed on the ſide of freedom; and every one be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to its defence. <hi>As long, therefore, as the republican part of our government can maintain itſelf againſt the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the preſs open, as of importance to its own preſervation.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There is another authority co-temporary with the laſt, a ſplendid ſpeaker in the upper Houſe of Parliament, and who held during moſt of his time high offices under the king; I ſpeak of the Earl
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0127200302:250"/>of Cheſterfield, who thus expreſſed himſelf in the Houſe of Lords:— <q>One of the greateſt bleſſings, my lords, we enjoy, is liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil—licentiouſneſs is the alloy of liberty, it is.</q>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Kenyon.</hi> Doctor Johnſon claims to pluck that feather from Lord Cheſterfield's wing; he ſpeaks, I believe, of the eye of the political body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Erſkine.</hi> Gentlemen, I have heard it ſaid, that Lord Cheſterfield borrowed that which I was juſt about to ſtate, and which his lordſhip has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Kenyon.</hi> That every ſpeech which did Lord Cheſterfield ſo much honour, is ſuppoſed to have been written by Doctor Johnſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Erſkine.</hi> Gentlemen, I believe it was ſo, and I am much obliged to his lordſhip for giving me a far higher authority for my doctrine. For though Lord Cheſterfield was a man of great ingenuity and wit, he was undoubtedly far inferior in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in monarchical opinion, to the celebrated writer to whom my lord has now delivered the work by his authority. Doctor Johnſon then ſays, <q>One of the greateſt bleſſings we enjoy, one of the greateſt bleſſings a people, my lords, can enjoy, is liberty; but every good in this life has its alloy of evil: Licentiouſneſs is the alloy of liberty; it is an ebullition, and excreſcence; it is a ſpeck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle, with trembling hand, left I deſtroy the body, leſt I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is ſuch a connection between licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and liberty, that it is not eaſy to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the one, without dangerouſly wounding the other; it is extremely hard to diſtinguiſh the true limit between them; like a changeable ſilk, we can eaſily ſee there are two different colours, but we cannot eaſily diſcover where
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0127200302:251"/>the one ends, or where the other begins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, I cannot help agreeing with this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed author. The da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ger of touching the preſs is the difficulty of marking its limits. My learned friend, who has juſt gone out of court, has drawn no line, and unfolded no principle. He has not told us, if this book is condemned, what book may be written. If I may not write againſt the exiſtence of monarchy, and recommend a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, may I write againſt any part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? May I ſay that we ſhould be better without a Houſe of Lords, or a Houſe of Commons, or a Court of Chancery, or any other given part of our eſtabliſhment? Or if, as has been hinted, a work may become libellous for ſtating even regal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſarcaſtic phraſe, the difficulty becomes the greater, and the liberty of the preſs more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to define.</p>
               <p>The ſame author purſuing the ſubject, and ſpeaking of the fall of Roman liberty, ſays, <q>But this ſort of liberty came ſoon after to be called licentiouſneſs; for we are told that Auguſtus, after having eſtabliſhed his empire, reſtored or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Rome, by reſtraining licentiouſneſs. God forbid we ſhould in this country have order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, or licentiouſneſs reſtrained, at ſo dear a rate as the people of Rome paid for it to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let us conſider, my lords. that arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has ſeldom, or never been introduced into any country at once. It muſt be introduced by ſlow degrees, and 2s is were ſtep by ſtep, leſt the people ſhould ſee its approach. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers and fences of the people's liberty, muſt be plucked one by one, and ſome plauſible preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt be found for removing or hoodwink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one after another, thoſe centries who are poſted by the conſtitution of a free country, for warning the people of their danger. When
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0127200302:252"/>theſe preparatory ſteps are once made, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may then, indeed, with regret, ſee ſlavery and arbitrary power making long ſtrides over their land; but it will be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſtage, my lords, and the preſs, are two of our out-ſentries; if we remove them, if we hoodwink them, if we throw them in fetters, the enemy may ſurprize us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this ſubject was ſtill more lately put in the juſteſt and moſt forcible light, by a noble perſon high in the magiſtracy; and whoſe mind is not at all turned to the introduction of diſorder by improper popular exceſſes: I mean Lord Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, chief juſtice of the court of common pleas. I believe I can anſwer for the correctneſs of my note, which I ſhall follow up with the opinion of another member of the Lord's Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the preſent Earl of Stanhope; or rather, I ſhall take Lord Stanhope firſt, as his lordſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces the ſubject by adverting to this argument of Lord Loughborough's. "If," ſays his lordſhip, <q>our boaſted liberty of the preſs, were to conſiſt only in the liberty to write in praiſe of the conſtitution, this is a liberty enjoyed under many arbitrary governments. I ſuppoſe it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offence, even by the Empreſs of Ruſſia, if any man were to take into his head to write a panegvric upon the Ruſſian form of government. Such a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as that might therefore properly be termed, <hi>the Ruſſian liberty of the preſs.</hi> But <hi>the Engliſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the preſs,</hi> is of a very different deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, by the law of England, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to publiſh ſpeculative works upon the conſtitution, <hi>whether they contain praiſe or cenſure:</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Stanhope's defence of the libel bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee therefore, as far as the general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple goes, I am ſupported by the opinion of Lord
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0127200302:253"/>Stanhope, for otherwiſe the noble lord has written a libel himſelf, by exciting other people to write <hi>whatever they may think,</hi> be it good or evil, of the conſtitution of the country. As to the other high authority, Lord Loughborough, I will read what applies to this ſubject—'Every man' ſaid Lord Loughbourough, <q>may publiſh at his diſcretion his opinions concerning forms and ſyſtems of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If they be wiſe and enlightening, the world will gain by them; if they be weak and abſurd, they will be laughed at and forgotten, and, if they be <hi>bona ſide,</hi> they cannot be criminal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever erroneous. On the other hand, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and the direction may give a different turn to writings, whoſe common conſtruction is harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or even meritorious. Suppoſe men, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in diſturbance of the peace, to pull down mills or turnpikes, or to do any other miſchief, and that a miſchievous perſon ſhould diſperſe among them, an excitation to the planned miſchief known to be both writer and reader, <hi>To your tents, O Iſrael!</hi> that publication would be criminal. But how criminal? not as a libel, not as an abſtract writing, but as an act; and the act being the crime <hi>it muſt be ſtated as af act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinfic on the record:</hi> for, otherwiſe, a court of error could have no juriſdiction, but over the natural conſtruction of the writing: nor would the defendant have any notice of ſuch matter at the trial, without a charge on the record. To give the jury cognizance of any matter beyond the conſtruction of the writing, the averrment, ſhould be in the caſe as I have inſtanced, that certain perſons were, as I have deſcribed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; and that the publiſher, intending to execute theſe perſons ſo aſſembled, wrote <hi>ſo and ſo.</hi> Here the crime is complete, and conſiſts in an overt-act of wickedneſs evidenced by a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0127200302:254"/>In anſwer to all theſe authorities, the attorney general may ſay, that, if Mr Paine had written his obſervations with the views of thoſe high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and under their circumſtances, he would be protected and acquitted: to which I can only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that no facts or circumſtances attending his work are either charged or proved; that you have no juriſdiction whatever but over the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the work before you, and that I am therefore brought without a flaw in the deduction to the paſſages which are the particular ſubject of complaint.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am come now to obſerve on the paſſages ſelected by the information; and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the firſt I ſhall diſpoſe of it in a moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All <hi>hereditary</hi> government is in its nature ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. An hereditable crown, or an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble throne, or by what other fanciful name ſuch things may be called, have no other ſignificant explination than that mankind, are heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>property.</hi> To inherit a government, is to <hi>inherit the people,</hi> as if they were flocks and herds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And is it to be endured, ſays the attorney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that the people of this country are to be told that they are driven like oxen or ſheep? Certainly not. I am of opinion that a more dangerous doctrine cannot be inſtilled into the people of England. But who inſtills ſuch a doctrine? I deny it is inſtilled by Paine. For when he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that hereditary monarchy inherits a people like flocks and herds, it is clear from the context <hi>(which is kept out of view,)</hi> that he is combating the propoſition in Mr. Burke's book, which aſſerts, that the hereditary monarchy of England is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened upon the people of England by indiſſoluble compact. Mr. Paine, on the contrary, aſſerts the King of England te be the <hi>magiſtrate of the people,</hi> exiſting by their conſent, which is utterly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patable
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0127200302:255"/>with their being driven like herds His argument, therefore, is this, and it retorts on his adverſary: he ſays, ſuch a king as you repreſent the King of England to be, inheriting the people by virtue of conqueſt, or of ſome compact, which, having once exiſted, cannot be diſolved while the original terms of it are kept, <hi>is an inheritance like flocks and herds.</hi> But I deny that to be the King of England's title, he is <hi>the magiſtrate of the people,</hi> and that title I reſpect. It is to your own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary King of England therefore, and not to his majeſty, that your unſounded innuendos apply. It is the monarchs of Ruſſia and Pruſſia, and all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments faſtened upon unwilling ſubjects by hereditary indefeaſible titles, that are ſtigmatiſed by Paine, as inheriting the people like flocks. The ſentence, therefore, muſt either be taken in the pure abſtract, and then it is not only merely ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, but the application of it to our own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment fails altogether, or it muſt be taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the matter which conſtitutes the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and then it is Mr. Burke's King of England, and not his majeſty whoſe title is denied.</p>
               <p>I paſs therefore to the next paſſage, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an extraordinary ſelection. It is taken at a leap from page 21, to page 47, and breaks in at the words, "This convention." The ſentence ſelected ſtands thus, <q>This convention met at phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia in May 1787, of which General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was elected preſident. He was not at that time connected with any of the ſtate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or with congreſs. He delivered up his commiſſion when the war ended, and ſince then had lived a private citizen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The convention went deeply into all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and having after a variety of debate and inveſtigation, agreed among themſelves upon the ſeveral parts of a federal conſtitution, the next queſtion was, the manner of giving it au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and practice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0127200302:256"/>
                  <q>For this purpoſe, they did not like a cabal of courtiers, ſend for a Dutch ſtadtholder, or a German elector; but they referred the whole matter to the ſenſe and intereſt of the country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſentence, ſtanding thus by itſelf, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a mere ſarcaſm on King William, upon thoſe who effected the revolution; and upon the revolution itſelf, without any reaſoning or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: But when the context and ſequel are looked at and compared, it will appear to be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hiſtorical compariſon between the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on effected in England in 1688, and the late one in America when ſhe eſtabliſhed her independ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence; and no man can doubt that his judgment on that compariſon was ſincere. But where is the libel on the conſtitution? For whether King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was brought over here by the ſincereſt and juſteſt motives of the whole people of England, each man acting for himſelf, or through the motives and agencies imputed by the defendant, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not one farthing at this time of day to the eſtabliſhment itſelf. Blackſtone warns us not to fix our obedience or affection to the government on the motives of our anceſtors, or the rectitude of their reaſonings, but to be ſatisfied that it is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. This is ſafe reaſoning, and for my own part, I ſhall not be differently affected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of my country, which my own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding approved, whether angels or demons had given it birth.</p>
               <p>Do any of you love the reformation the leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Henry the Eighth was the author of it? Or becauſe luſt and poverty, and not religion, were his motives. He had ſquandered the treaſures of his father, and he preferred Anne Bullen to his queen: theſe were the cauſes which produced it. What then! does that affect the purify of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, undermine its eſtabliſhment, or ſhake the king's title as prince of the country, to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0127200302:257"/>the excluſion of thoſe who held by the religion it had aboliſhed? Will the attorney general affirm, that I could be convicted of a libel for a whole volume of aſperity againſt Henry the Eighth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rely becauſe he effected the reformation; and if not, why againſt King William, who effected the revolution? Where is the line to be drawn? Is one, two, or three centuries to be ſtatute of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But do not our own hiſtorians detail this very cabal of courtiers, from the records of our own country? If you will turn to Hume's hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, volume the eighth, page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>But what of all this, concerning the motives of parties, which is recorded by Hume. The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>what is the thing brought about,—Not</hi> HOW it was brought about. If it ſtand as Blackſtone argues it, upon the conſent of our anceſtors, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by our own, no individual can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his obedience. If he diſlikes the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him ſeek elſewhere for another; I am not contending for uncontroled <hi>conduct,</hi> but for freedom of <hi>opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With regard to what has been ſtated of the <hi>Edwards,</hi> and <hi>Henries.</hi> and the other princes under which the author can only diſcover <q>reſtrictions on power, but nothing of a conſtitution:</q> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my friend is not in earneſt when he ſelects that as a libel.</p>
               <p>Paine inſiſts, that there was no conſtitution under thoſe princes, and that Engliſh liberty was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from uſurped power by the ſtruggles of the people. SO SAY I. And I think it for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage of the country that it ſhould be known. Was there any freedom after the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal eſtabliſhment of the Normans by conqueſt?
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0127200302:258"/>Was not the MAGNA CHARTA <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reſted from John by open force of arms at Runnymead? Was it not again re-enacted whilſt menacing arms were in the hands of the people? Were not its ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions broken through, and two and forty times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enacted by parliament, upon the firm demand of the people in the following reigns? I proteſt it fills me with aſtoniſhment to hear theſe truths brought in queſtion.</p>
               <p>I was formerly called upon under the diſcipline of a college to maintain them, and was rewarded for being thought to have ſucceſsfully maintained, that our preſent conſtitution was by no means a remnant of Saxon liberty, nor any other inſtitution of liberty, but the pure conſequence of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Norman tenures, which ſpreading the ſpirit of freedom from one end of the kingdom to the other, enabled our brave fathers, inch by inch, not to re-conquer, <hi>but for the firſt time to obtain</hi> thoſe privileges which are the unalienable inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all mankind.</p>
               <p>But why do we ſpeak of the Edwards and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when Hume himſelf expreſsly ſays, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all we have heard to-day of the antiquity of our conſtitution, that our monarchy was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſolute till the middle of laſt century. I have his book in court, and will read it to you. It is his eſſay on the liberty of the preſs. Vol. 1. page 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All abſolute governments, and ſuch in great meaſure was England, till the middle of the laſt century, <hi>notwithſtanding the numerous panegyrics on</hi> ANCIENT <hi>English liberty,</hi> muſt very much depend on the adminiſtration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is Hume's opinion; the concluſion of a grave hiſtorian from all that he finds recorded as the materials for hiſtory: and ſhall it be ſaid that Mr. Paine is to be puniſhed for writing to-day what was before written by another, who is now a diſtinguiſhed claſſic in the language? All the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0127200302:259"/>verdicts in the world will not make that palateable to an impartial public, or to poſterity,</p>
               <p>The next paſſage arrained is this: P. 56. <q>The attention of the government of England, (for I rather chuſe to call it by this name, than the Engliſh government) appears, ſince its political connection with Germany, to have been ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely engroſſed and abſorbed by foreign affairs, and the means of raiſing taxes, that it ſeems to exiſt for no other purpoſes. Domeſtic concerns are neglected; and with reſpect to regular law, there is no ſuch a thing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the government of this country is, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of its connection with the continent, and the continental wars which it has occaſioned, been continually loaded with grievous taxes, no man can diſpute; and I appeal to your juſtice, whether this ſubject has not been, for years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the conſtant topic of unreproved declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and grumbling?</p>
               <p>As to what he ſays with regard to there hardly being ſuch a thing as regular law, he ſpeaks in the abſtract of the complexity of our ſyſtem; but does not arraign the adminiſtration of juſtice <hi>in its practice.</hi> But with regard to criticiſms and ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the general ſyſtem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it has been echoed over and over again, by various authors; and even from the pulpits of our country, that the law of the land is mainly defective, devoid of regularity and preciſion, and overloaded with a variety of expenſive and unneceſſary forms. I have a ſermon in court written during the American war, by a perſon of great eloquence and piety, part of which I will read to you on this ſubject, in which he looks forward to an exemption from the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable grievances of our old legal ſyſtem in the infant eſtabliſhment of the new world.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It may be in the purpoſes of providence, on you weſtern ſhores, to raiſe the bulwark of a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0127200302:260"/>purer reformation than ever Britain patronized; to found a leſs burthen ſome, more auſpicious, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and incorruptible government than ever Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has enjoyed; and to eſtabliſh there a ſyſtem of law more juſt and ſimple in its principles, leſs intricate, dubious and dilatory in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, more mild and equitable in its ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more eaſy and more certain in its execution; wherein no man can err through ignorance of what concerns him, or want juſtice through poverty or weakneſs, or eſcape it by legal arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or civil privileges, or interpoſing power; wherein the rule of conduct ſhall not be hidden or diſguiſed in the language of principles and cuſtoms that died with the barbariſm which gave them birth; wherein haſty formulas ſhall not diſſipate the reverence that is due to the tribunals and tranſactions of juſtice; wherein obſolete preſcripts ſhall not pervert, nor entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, nor impede the adminiſtration of it, nor in any inſtance expoſe it to deriſion or to diſregard; wherein miſrepreſentation ſhall have no ſhare in deſiding upon right and truth; and under which no man ſhall grow great by the wages of chicanery, or thrive by the quarrels that are ruinous to his employers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is ten times ſtronger than Mr. Paine; but who ever thought of proſecuting Mr. Cappe?</p>
               <p>In various other inſtances you will find defects in our juriſprudence. pointed out and lamented, and not ſeldom by perſons called upon by their ſituations to deliver the law in the ſeat of magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy, therefore, the authors <hi>general</hi> obſervation does not appear to be that ſpecies of attack upon the magiſtracy of the country as to fall within the deſcription of a libel.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the two houſes of parliament, I believe I ſhall be able to ſhew you that the very perſon who introduced this controverſy, and who
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0127200302:261"/>certainly is conſidered by thoſe who now admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the government, as a man uſefully devoted to maintain the conſtitution of the country in the preſent criſis, has himſelf made remarks upon theſe aſſemblies; that upon compariſon you will think more ſevere than thoſe which are the ſubject of the attorney general's animadverſion. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in Mr. Paine runs thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>With reſpect to the <hi>two houſes,</hi> of which the Engliſh Parliament is compoſed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one, and, as a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, to have no temper of its own. The miniſter, who ever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it ſleeps obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But if we look at the diſtinct abilities of the two houſes, the difference will appear ſo great, as to ſhew the inconſiſtency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to uſe it. Wretched as the ſtate of repreſentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the Houſe of Lords; and ſo little is this nick-named houſe regarded, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſcarcely enquire at any time what it is doing. It appears alſo to be moſt under influence, and the furtheſt removed from the general intereſt of the nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The concluſion of the ſentence, and which was meant by Paine as the evidence of the previous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, the attorney general has omitted in the information, and in his ſpeech, it is this: <q>In the debate on engaging in the Ruſſian and Turkiſh war, the majority in the Houſe of Peers in favour of it, was upwards of ninety, when in the other houſe, which is more than double its numbers, the majority was ſixty three.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The terms, however, in which Mr. Burke ſpeaks of the Houſe of Lords, are ſtill more expreſſive. <q>It is ſomething more than a century ago, ſince
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0127200302:262"/>we voted the Houſe of Lords uſeleſs. They have now voted themſelves ſo, and the whole hope of reformation</q> (<hi>ſpeaking of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> "is caſt upon us." This ſentiment, Mr. Burke not only expreſſed in his place in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where no man can call him to an account; but it has been ſince, repeatedly printed amongſt his other valuable works. And his opinion of BOTH THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, which I am about to read to you, was originally publiſhed as a pamphlet, and applied to the ſettled abuſes of theſe high aſſemblies. Remember, I do not uſe them as <hi>argumenta ad hominem,</hi> or <hi>ad invidiam</hi> againſt the author, for if I did, it could be no defence of Mr. Paine. But I uſe them as high authority, the work [<hi>Mr. Burke's thoughts on the cauſe of the preſent diſcontent, publiſhed in</hi> 1775] having been the juſt foundation of ſubſtantial and laſting reputation. Would to God that any part of it were capable of being denied or doubted.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Againſt the being of parliament, I am ſatisfied no deſigns have ever been entertained ſince the revolution. Every one muſt perceive that it is ſtrongly the intereſt of the court to have ſome ſecond cauſe interpoſed between the miniſters and the people. The gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons have an intereſt equally ſtrong, in ſuſtaining the part of that intermediate cauſe. However they may hire out the <hi>uſufruct</hi> of their voices, they never will part with the <hi>fee</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> Accordingly thoſe who have been of the moſt known devotion to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a court, have at the ſame time been moſt forward in aſſerting an high authority in the Houſe of Commons. <hi>When they knew who were to uſe that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought it never could be carried to far.</hi> It muſt be always the wiſh of an unconſtitutional ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that an Houſe of Commons, <hi>who are entirely
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0127200302:263"/>dependant upon him, ſhould have every right of the people dependant on their pleaſure.</hi> FOR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMS OF A FREE AND THE ENDS OF AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT, WERE THINGS NOT ALTOGETHER INCOMPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TABLE.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The power of the crown almoſt dead and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as prerogative, has grown up a new, with much more ſtrength, and far leſs odium, under the name of <hi>influence.</hi> An influence which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates without noiſe and violence; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the very antagoniſt into the inſtrument of power; which contains in itſelf a perpetual principle of growth and renovation; and which the diſtreſſes and the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> an admirable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for a prerogative, that being only the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its original ſtamina irreſiſtable principles of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and diſſolution. The ignorance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a bottom but for a temporary ſyſtem; but the intereſt of active men in the ſtate is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perpetual and infallible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke therefore, in page 66, ſpeaking of the ſame court party, ſays:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Parliament was indeed the great object of all theſe politics, the end at which they aimed, as well as the INSTRUMENT by which they were to operate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And purſuing the ſubject in page 70, proceeds as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They who will not confirm their conduct to the public good, and cannot ſupport it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan. They have totally abandoned the ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and old-faſhioned fortreſs of prerogative, and made a lodgment in the ſtrong hold of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf. If they have any evil deſign to which there is no ordinary legal power commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0127200302:264"/>they bring it into parliament. <hi>There the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. And the power of obtaining their object abſolute; and the ſafety in the proceeding perfect; no rules to confine nor after reckonings to terrify,</hi> For parliament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any propriety puniſh others for things in which they themſelves have been ACCOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLICES.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus its controul upon the executory power is loſt; becauſe it is made to partake in every conſiderable act of government, <hi>and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>achment, that great guardian of the purity of the conſtitution, is in danger of being loſt even to the idea of it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an aſſembly; ſtill in ſome ſort popular, led to the greateſt honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is reverſed; and the favour of the court is the only ſure way of obtaining and holding thoſe honours which ought to be IN THE DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSAL OF THE PEOPLE.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke, in page 100, obſerves with great truth, that the miſchiefs he complained of, did not at all ariſe from the monarchy, but from the parliament, and that it was the duty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to look to it. He ſays, <q>The diſtempers of monarchy were the great ſubjects of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and redreſs, in the <hi>last century; in this,</hi> the diſtempers of parliament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Not the diſtempers of parliament in this year or the laſt, but in <hi>this century,</hi> i. e. its ſettled habitual diſtemper. <q>It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary diſorders can be completed; and hardly indeed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the people ought to be <hi>excited</hi> to a more ſtrict and detailed attention to the conduct of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives. Standards for judging more ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematically upon their conduct, ought to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0127200302:265"/>in the meetings of counties and corporations, and frequent and correct liſts of the voters in all important queſtions ought to be procured.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By ſuch means ſomething may be done, ſince it may appear who thoſe are, that by an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate ſupport of all adminiſtrations, have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally baniſhed all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded the beſt men with the worſt; and weakened and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, inſtead of ſtrengthening and compacting the general frame of government.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I wiſh it was poſſible to read the whole of this moſt important volume—but the conſequences of theſe truths contained in it were all eloquently ſummed up by the author in his ſpeech upon the reform of the houſehold.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But what I confeſs was uppermoſt with me, what I bent the whole courſe of my mind to, was the reduction of that <hi>corrupt influence</hi> which is itſelf the perennial ſpring of all prodigality and diſorder; which load us more than millions of debt; which takes away vigour from our arms, wiſdom from our councils, and every ſhadow of authority and credit from the moſt venerable parts of our conſtitution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame important truths were held out to the whole public, upon a ſtill later occaſion, by the perſon now at the head of his majeſty's councils; and ſo high (as it appears) in the confidence of the nation. <hi>He,</hi> not in the abſtract like the author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, but upon the ſpur of the occaſion, and in the teeth of what had been just declared in the Houſe of Commons, came to, and acted upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions which are contained in this book. <hi>(Mr. Erſkine took up a book.)</hi> Reſolutions pointed to the purification of a parliament, dangerouſly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the very state deſcribed by Mr. Paine. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member here too, that I impute no cenſure to Mr, Pitt. It was the most brilliant paſſage in his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0127200302:266"/>life, and I ſhould have thought his life a better one, if he had continued uniform in the ſupport of opinions, which it is ſaid he has not changed, and which certainly have had nothing to change them. But at all events, I have a right to make uſe of the authority of his ſplended talents and ſituation, not merely to protect the defendant, but the public, and to reſiſt the precedent, that one man may do in England with approbation and glory, what ſhall conduct another man to a pillory or a priſon.</p>
               <p>It was the abuſes pointed out by the man before you, that led that right honourable gentleman to aſſociate with many others of high rank, under the banners of the Duke of Richmond, whoſe name ſtands at the head of the liſt, and to paſs various public reſolutions, concerning the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of purifying the Houſe of Commons; and we collect the plan from a preamble entered in the book. <q>Whereas the life, liberty and property of every man is or may be affected by the law of the land in which he lives, and every man is bound to pay obedience to the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And whereas, by the conſtitution of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the right of making laws is veſted in three eſtates, of king, lords, and commons, in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled, and the conſent of all the three ſaid eſtates, comprehending the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is neceſſary to make laws to bind the whole community. And whereas the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons repreſents all the commons of the realm, and the conſent of the Houſe of Commons binds the conſent of all the commons of the realm, and in all caſes on which the legiſlature is competent to decide.</q>

               <p>Theſe with many others, were publiſhed, not as abſtract, ſpeculative writings, but within a few days after the Houſe of Commons had declared that no ſuch rights exiſted, and that no alteration was neceſſary in the repreſentation. It was then that they met at the thatched-houſe, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their opinions and reſolutions to the country at large.—Were any of them proſecuted for theſe proceedings? Certainly not, (for they were legal proceedings.) But I deſire you as men of honour
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0127200302:268"/>and truth, to compare all this with Mr. Paine's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of miniſter's touching parliament with his opiate wand, and let equal juſtice be done—that is all I aſk—LET ALL BE PUNISHED, OR NONE—do not let Mr. Paine be held out to the contempt of the public, upon the ſcore of his obſervations on parliament, while others are enjoying all the ſweets which attend a ſuppoſed attachment to their country, who have ſaid the ſame things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their opinions to practice.</p>
               <p>But now every man is to be cried down for ſuch opinions. I obſerved that my learned friend ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly raiſed his voice in naming Mr. Horne Tooke, as if to connect him with Paine, or Paine with him. This is exactly the ſame courſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; for after all he ſaid nothing of Mr. Tooke. What could he have ſaid, but that he was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber with the great names, I have read in theſe proceedings which they have thought fit to deſert.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, let others hold their opinions and change them at their pleaſure; I ſhall ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to be the deareſt privilege of the people of Great Britain to watch over every thing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects their good government, either in the ſyſtem, or in the practice; and that for this purpoſe the preſs muſt be free. It has always been ſo, and much evil has been corrected by it.—If govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment finds itſelf annoyed by it, let it examine its own conduct, and it will find the cauſe,—let it amend it, and it will find the remedy.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am no friend to ſarcaſms in the diſcuſſion of grave ſubjects, but you muſt take writers according to the view of the mind at the moment; Mr. Burke as often as any body indulges it;—hear his reaſon in his ſpeech on reform, for not taking away the ſalaries from lords who attend upon the Britiſh court. "You would," ſaid he, <q>have the court deſerted by all the nobility of the kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0127200302:269"/>
                  <q>Sir, the moſt ſerious miſchiefs would follow from ſuch a deſertion. Kings are naturally lovers of low company; they are ſo elevated above all the reſt of mankind, that they muſt look upon all the irſubjects as on a level; tbey are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occaſional reſiſtance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, or their pride. It muſt indeed be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, paraſites, pimps, and buffoons, as any of the loweſt and vileſt of mankind can poſſibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, with ſome lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe. The Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, almoſt from the beginning, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſuch hands; and the miſchief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed every day, till its decline, and its final ruin. It is, therefore, of very great importance (provided the thing is not overdone,) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſuch an eſtabliſhent as muſt, almoſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his perſon, a great number of his firſt nobility; and it is rather an uſeful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that gives them a pride in ſuch a ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have, therefore, not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the king's perſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is this, but ſaying that a king is an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſo incurably addicted to low company, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to bring on by it the ruin of nations; but nevertheleſs, he is to be kept as a neceſſary evil, and his propenſities bridled by ſurrounding him
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0127200302:270"/>with a parcel of miſcreants ſtill worſe if poſſible, but better than thoſe he would chooſe for himſelf. This therefore, if taken by itſelf, would be a moſt abominable and libellous ſarcaſm on kings and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: but look at the whole ſpeech, and you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a great ſyſtem of regulation; and no man, I believe, ever doubted Mr. Burke's attachment to monarchy. To judge, therefore, of any part of a writing, the whole muſt be read.</p>
               <p>With the ſame view, I mean to read to you, the beginning of Harrington's Oceana: but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to name this well known author without expoſing to juſt contempt and ridicule, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or profligate miſrepreſentations which are vomited forth upon the public, to bear down eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man as deſperately wicked, who in any age or country has countenanced a republic, for the mean purpoſe of prejudging this trial.</p>
               <p>Is this the way to ſupport the Engliſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Are theſe the means by which Engliſhmen are to be taught to cheriſh it? I ſay, if the man upon trial were ſtained with blood inſtead of ink, if he were covered over with crimes which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature would ſtart at the naming of, the means employed againſt him would not be the leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful.</p>
               <p>For this notable purpoſe then, Harrington not above a week ago, was handed out to us as a low, obſcure wretch, involved in the murder of the monarch, and the deſtruction of the monarchy, and as addreſſing his deſpicable works at the ſhrine of an uſurper. Yet this very Harrington, this low blackguard, was deſcended (you may ſee his pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at the Herald's-office for ſixpence,) from eight dukes, three marquiſſes, ſeventy earls, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven viſcounts, and thirty-ſix barons, ſixteen of whom were knights of the garter; a deſcent which I think would ſave a man from diſgrace in any of the circles of Germany. But what was he
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0127200302:271"/>beſides?—A BLOOD-STAINED RUFFIAN? Oh; brutal ignorance of the hiſtory of the country. He was the moſt affectionate ſervant of Charles the Firſt, from whom he never concealed his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; for it is obſerved by Wood, that the king greatly aflected his company; but when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to talk of a common-wealth, he would ſcarce endure it.—'I know not,' ſays Toland, <q>which moſt to commend; the king for truſting an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, though a republican; or Harrington for owning his principles while he ſerved a king.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But did his opinions affect his conduct? Let hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory again anſwer.—He preſerved his fidelity to his unhappy prince to the very laſt, after all his fawning courtiers had left him to his enraged ſubjects. He ſtaid with him while a priſoner in the Iſle of Wight, came up by ſtealth to follow the fortunes of his monarch and maſter; even hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the boot of the coach when he was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Windſor; and ending as he began, fell into his arms and fainted on the ſcaffold.</p>
               <p>After Charles's death, the Oceana was written, and, as if it were written from juſtice and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ction to his memory: for it breathes the ſame noble and ſpirited regard, and aſſerts that it was not Charles that brought on the deſtruction of the monarchy, but the feeble and ill-conſtituted nature of monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy itſelf.</p>
               <p>But the book was a flattery to Cromwell.—Once more and finally let hiſtory decide.</p>
               <p>It was ſeized by the uſurper as a libel, and the way it was recovered was remarkable. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to ſhew that Cromwell was a wiſe man in himſelf, and knew on what government muſt ſtand for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

The Oceana was afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored on her petition; Cromwell anſwering with the ſagacity of a ſound politician, <q>Let him have his book; if my government is made to ſtand, it has nothing to fear from PAPER SHOT.</q>
                  <q>—He ſaid true.—No good government will ever be battered with paper ſhot. Monteſquieu ſays that In a free nation, it matters not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther individuals reaſon well or ill; it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that they do reaſon. Truth ariſes from the colliſion, and from hence ſprings liberty, which is a ſecurity from the effect of reaſoning.</q> The attorney general read extracts from Mr. Adams's Anſwer to this book. Let others do like Mr. Adams: I am not inſiſiting upon the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Mr. Paine's doctrines: if they are errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, let them be anſwered, and truth will ſpring from the colliſion.</p>
               <p>A diſpoſition in a nation to this ſpecies of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, is no proof of ſedition or degeneracy, but quite the reverſe, as is mentioned by Milion, [I omitted to cite the paſſage with the others] who in ſpeaking of this ſubject, riſes into that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſublime ſtile of writing, wholly peculiar to himſelf. He was indeed no plagiary from any thing human: he looked up for light and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he himſelf wonderfully deſcribes it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout prayer to that great being, who is the ſource of all utterance and knowledge; and who ſendeth out his ſeraphim with the hallowed fire of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleaſes. 'When the chearfulneſs of the people,' ſays this mighty poet, <q>is ſo ſprightly up, as that is has not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and ſafety, but to ſpare, and to beſtow upon the ſolideſt and ſublimeſt points of controverſy and new inventions, it betokens us not degenerated
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0127200302:273"/>nor drooping to a fatal decay, but caſting off the old and wrinkled ſkin of corruption to outlive theſe pangs, and wax young again, entering the glorious ways of truth and proſperous virtue, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to become great and honourable in theſe latter ages. Methinks I ſee in my mind, a noble and puiſant nation rouſing herſelf, like a ſtrong man after ſleep, and ſhaking her invincible locks: methinks I ſee her as an eagle muing her migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day beam; purging and unſealing her long abuſed ſight at the fountain itſelf of heavenly radiance; while the whole noiſe of timorous and flocking birds, with thoſe alſo that love the twilight, flutter about, amazed at what ſhe means, and in their envious gabble would prognoſticate a year of ſects and ſchiſms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, what Milton only ſaw in his mighty imagination, I ſee in fact; what he expected, but what never came to paſs, I ſee now fulfilling: methinks I ſee this noble and puiſſant nation, not degenerated and drooping to a fatal decay, but caſting off the wrinkled ſkin of corruption to put on again the vigour of her youth.</p>
               <p>And it is, becauſe others, as well as myſelf ſee this, that we have ALL THIS UPROAR;—France and its conſtitution are the mere pretences. It is, becauſe Britons begin to recollect the inheritance of their own conſtitution, left them by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: It is, becauſe they are awakened to the corruptions which have fallen upon its moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, that forſooth THE NATION IS IN DAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GER OF BEING DESTROYED BY A SINGLE PAMPHLET.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have marked the courſe of this alarm: It began with the renovation of thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the public, which the authors of the alarm had themſelves originated and deſerted; and they became louder and louder when they ſaw theſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0127200302:274"/>principles avowed and ſupported by my admirable and excellent friend Mr. Fox; the moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honeſt and enlightened ſtateſman, that hiſtory brings us acquainted with: a man whom to name is to honour, but whom in attempting adequately to deſcribe, I muſt fly to Mr. Burke, my conſtant refuge when eloquence is neceſſary: a man, who to relieve the ſufferings of the moſt diſtant nation, <q>put to the hazard, his eaſe, his ſecurity, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, his power, even his darling popularity, for the benefit of a people whom he had never ſeen,</q> How much more than for the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of his native country; yet this is the man who has been cenſured and diſavowed in the manner we have lately ſeen.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have but a few more words to trouble you with; I take my leave of you with declaring, that all this freedom which I have been endeavouring to aſſert, is no more than the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which belongs to our inbred conſtitution; I have not aſked to acquit Mr. Paine upon any new lights, or upon any principle but the law, which you are ſworn to adminiſter: My great object has been to inculcate, that wiſdom and policy, which are the parents of the law of Great Britain, forbid this jealous eye over her ſubjects: and that, on the contrary, they cry aloud in the language of the poet, employed by Lord Chatham on the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſubject of America, unfortunately without effect:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Be to their faults a little blind,</l>
                  <l>"Be to their virtues, very kind;</l>
                  <l>"Let all their thoughts be unconfin'd,</l>
                  <l>"And clap your padlock on their mind."</l>
               </q>
               <p>Engage them by their affections, convince their reaſon, and they will be loyal from the only prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that can make loyalty ſincere, vigorous, or rational, a conviction that it is their trueſt intereſt,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0127200302:275"/>and that their form of government is for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. Conſtraint is the natural parent of reſiſtance, and a pregnant proof, that reaſon is not on the ſide of thoſe who uſe it. You muſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, gentlemen, Lucian's pleaſant ſtory: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter and a countryman were walking together, converſing with great freedom and familiarity upon the ſubjects of Heaven and earth. The country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man liſtened with attention and acquieſcence, while Jove ſtrove only to convince him; but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to hint a doubt, Jupiter turned haſtily round, and threatened him with his thunder. "Ah! ha!" ſays the countryman, <q>now Jupiter, I know that you are wrong; you are always wrong when when you ſeek to convince by your thunder.</q>

               <p>THE preſent inhabitants of Swiſſerland are deſcended from the ancient Helvetii, who were ſubdued by Julius Caeſar. They continued long under little better than the nominal dominion of the Houſes of Burgundy and Auſtria, till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 14th century, when the ſeverity with which they were treated by the Auſtrian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, excited a general inſurrection, and gave riſe to what is now called, from the ancient name of the country, the Helvetic confederacy.</p>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thus related: Albert, Emperor of Germany, having in vain attempted to compel all the Switzers to ſubmit to the yoke of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouſe of Auſtria, theſe people were ſo cruelly treated, that they entered into a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, in order to ſupport their ancient rights and privileges. Griſler, the governor of Uri, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcover the authors of the conſpiracy, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that his hat ſhould be fixed on the top of a pole in the market place of Altof, the capital of that province; and all thoſe who paſſed by it were obliged, on pain of death, to pay obeiſance to it, as if to the governor himſelf.</p>
               <p>William Tell, a man of influence in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, diſdaining the mark of viſſalage and ſlavery, refuſed to obey the tyrant's order; upon which the latter cauſed him to be arreſted, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſhoot an apple from the head of his only ſon, who was about five years old. Tell anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he would rather ſuffer death himſelf, than riſque the ſafety of his ſon. The tyrant declared, that he would hang them both, if he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0127200302:277"/>obey. Thus compelled, Tell reluctantly took his bow, and from the head of his ſon, who was tied to a tree, he ſhot away the apple, to thr admiration of all the ſpectators. The governo perceiving that he had a ſecond arrow, demanded what he intended to do with it; aſſuring him at the ſame time of his full pardon, if he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the truth.—'To pierce thy heart,' replied Tell, 'If I had been ſo unfortunate as to kill my ſon.'</p>
               <p>Griſler, baſely violating his promiſe, loaded him with chains, and made him embark with him on board a veſſel that was to croſs Lake Uri, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to confine him in a dungeon in one of his caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; but a dreadful tempeſt ariſing, the governor found that Tell's aſſiſtance was neceſſary to ſave himſelf and his crew. He therefore ordered his fetters to be taken off; and Tell, having ſteered the veſſel with ſafety towards a landing place, with which he was well acquainted. threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the water with his bow, and fled to the mountain. He there waited in a place that Griſler was obliged to paſs, and ſhot him in the heart with his remaining arrow. The brave Switzer then haſtened to announce the death of the tyrant, and their conſequent deliverance, to the confederates; and putting himſelf at the head of a multitude of his gallant countrymen, he took all the fortreſſes, and made the governors priſoners.</p>
               <p>Such is the celebrated hiſtory of the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Swiſs liberty, which ſome of the greateſt painters have ſelected as a favourite ſubject. It muſt not be concealed, however that ſome hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians affect to call in queſtion, the circumſtance of the apple; while others, on the contrary, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly received it.</p>
               <p>But, not to inveſtigate this ſubject further, all hiſtorians are agreed, that William Tell was one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed authors of this glorious
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0127200302:278"/>revolution; Griſler was unqueſtionably killed by him with an arrow. He entered into an aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Werner Stouffacher. Walter Furſt, and Arnold de Melctal, whoſe father had been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his ſight by the inhuman monſter. The plan of this revolution was formed on the 14th of November, 1307. The Emperor Albert, who would have treated theſe illuſtrious men as rebels, was prevented by his death. The Archduke Leop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old marched into their country with an army of 20,000 men.</p>
               <p>With a force, not exceeding 500, the brave Switzers waited for the main body of the Auſtrian army in the defiles of Morgate. More fortunate than Leonidas and his Lacedemonians, they put the invaders to flight, by rolling down great ſtones from the tops of the mountains. Other bodies of the Auſtrian army were defeated at the ſame time, by a number of Switzers equally ſmall. This vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory having been gained in the Canton of Schweitz, the other two Cantons gave this name to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, into which by degrees other Cantons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>Berne, which is to Switzerland what Amſterdam is to Holland, did not accede to this alliance till the year 1352; and it was not till 1513, that the ſmall diſtrict of Appenzel united to the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, and completed the number of thirteen. No people ever fought longer, nor better for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. They gained more than 60 combats againſt the Auſtrians, and it is believed, will long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their independence. A country, which is not too extenſive, nor too opulent, and where the laws breathe a ſpirit of mildneſs, muſt neceſſarily be free.</p>
               <p>This revolution in the government, produced another in the aſpect of the country. A barren ſoil, neglected under the dominion of tyrants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at length the ſcene of cultivation. Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0127200302:279"/>were planted on rocky mountains, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage tracts, cleared and tilled by the hands of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, became the fertile abode of peace and plenty.</p>

               <p>'TIS owing to the arts and induſtry of Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that the people are ſometimes uneaſy and diſcontent under a good government; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a government they are naturally inclined to be quiet and ſubmiſſive, and it muſt be very ill uſage that will tempt them to throw it off, when they are not firſt notoriouſly miſled. There were inſurrections againſt Guſtavus Ericſon, ſo there were againſt Queen Elizabeth; all animated by the ſame ſpirit, ſuperſtition managed and inflamed by prieſts. But when a juſt adminiſtration is once ſettled, and become familiar to the people, and where no violent innovations are attempted, they
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0127200302:280"/>will not be apt ſo diſturb it, nor to wiſh ill to it. They are in truth very ſlow to reſiſt, and often bear a thouſand hardſhips before they return one. The Romans long ſuffered the encroachments, inſults and tyranny of the laſt tarquin, before they drove him out, nor would they have done it ſo ſoon, but for the rape and tragical fate of Lucretia. The Dutch endured the tyranny of Spain, till that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny grew intolerable. When King Philip had wantonly violated his ſolemn oath, deſtroyed their ancient liberties and laws, ſhed their blood, acted like an implacable enemy, and uſed them like dogs, it was high time to convince him that they were men, and would continue free men in ſpite of his wicked attempts to enſlave them. They did ſo to ſome purpoſe, to their own immortal glory, and eſtabliſhment in perfect independency, to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite loſs and laſting ſhame.</p>
               <p>The people of Swiſſerland groaned long under the heavy yoke of Auſtria, ſuſtained a courſe of ſufferings and indignities too many and too great for human patience. So inſolent and barbarous were their governors, ſo tame and ſubmiſſive the governed. At laſt they rouſed themſelves, or rather their oppreſſive governors rouſed them, ſo as not to be quelled. Yet they carried their vengeance no farther than was barely neceſſary for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſecurity. They ſpilt little or none of the blood of their tyrants and taſk-maſters, the rulers from Auſtria, who had ſo freely ſpilled theirs. They only conducted theſe lawleſs ſpoilers to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the country, and there diſmiſſed them in ſafety, under an oath never more to return into their territories. What could be more ſlow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, what more meek in their reſiſtance than that brave and abuſed people? They were indeed ſo brave and had been ſo abuſed, as to reſolve never more to ſubmit to the imperial power. Thence forth they aſſerted their native freedom, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0127200302:281"/>it with amazing valour. With handfuls of men they overthrew mighty hoſts, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be conquered by all the neighbouring powers. Their exploits againſt the imperial armies, againſt thoſe of Lewis the Eleventh, then Dauphin, againſt Charles the bold, Duke of Burgundy are ſcarce credible. Three hundred and fifty Swiſs routed at one time, eight thouſand Auſtrians, ſome ſay ſixteen thouſand. An hundred and thirteen van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, the arch-duke Leopald's army of twenty thouſand, and killed a great number; an hundred and ſixteen beat another army of near twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and ſlew him.</p>
               <p>It was no ſmall provocation, no caſual miſtakes, or random ſallies of paſſion in their rulers, that drove the Dutch and Swiſs to expel theirs. No; the oppreſſion, the acts of violence were general, conſtant, deliberate and encreaſing. For ſuch is the nature of men in power; that they will rather commit two errors than retract one, as Lord Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon juſtly obſerves. Sometimes they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſecond, to ſhew that they are not aſhamed of the firſt, but reſolved to defy reſentment, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their contempt of the people, and how much they are above fear and amendment. Some of them have delighted to heighten cruelty by mirth and deriſion, like him in Swiſſerland, who having long inſulted and abuſed the poor people, and ſtill thinking their ſervitude imperfect, ſet up his cap in the market place, and obliged all that paſſed by to pay it reverence; nay to puniſh one for failing in duty to that cap, he cauſed him to place an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon his ſon's head, and at ſuch a diſtance to cleave it with an arrow. Was there not cauſe, was it not high time to exterminate ſuch inſtruments of cruelty?</p>
