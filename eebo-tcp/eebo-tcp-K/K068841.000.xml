            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF THE EDITOR.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very Body is convinced, that Men are created for Society-ſake; and no Body is ignorant, that without the Aſſiſtance of a great many others, he would be more miſerable than a Beaſt itſelf. But every Body is not convinc'd, that it is naturally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to become happy or rich, without contributing proportionably towards the Happineſs or Riches of others. At leaſt the Experience we have every Day of a great many People's building their Happineſs and Riches upon the Ruins of others, evidenceth clearly, that either they muſt be ſtark mad, or are not convinc'd that in ſo doing, they are acting againſt their own Intereſt. Nevertheleſs, there is nothing more true and nothing more deſerving our Attention than the Welfare of others, in Caſe we have a Mind to be happy ourſelves: It is nothing elſe but a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, to think, that Riches do conſiſt in the ſole Poſſeſſion of a great Quantity of Goods, and that ſuch a Quantity of Goods hath a ſovereign Virtue, to free ourſelves from all Troubles and Accidents. Since Men are not able to live without the perſonal Miniſtry of others, true Riches have no other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0135100100:3"/>than what is given them by the Will, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Power, and the Number of ſuch, who are to make Uſe thereof; they have no Value and no Price in themſelves, but what they receive from this Number; and accordingly as this Will, this Power, and this Number is preſerved, accordingly our pretended Riches have an Eſtimation. Without it, they are no more than Duſt.</p>
            <p>An infinite Number of <hi>Examples</hi> as well antient as modern do convince us thereof, and I have in a <hi>particular Treatiſe on the Way and Means to get Rich,</hi> now ready for the Preſs, purpoſely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to give a full Demonſtration of this Truth, where I remit the curious Reader. I ſhall only in this Place draw a Concluſion from what I have ſaid, which is, that if our Riches have no other Value and Eſtimation than what is given them by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of others, and if we cannot be rich without them, it is evident, that inſtead of ruining others contrary to our Intereſt, we ought proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to contribute towards the Preſervation of this Will, this Power, and this Number; and in caſe we really do intend to get rich and happy, we ought to be in Harmony with ſuch as are to give a Value and a Price to our Subſtance; and as we do not know preciſely, who is to give a Value to our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, we ought to regard every Body as ſuch.</p>
            <p>If every Body is to be conſider'd, to be of the Number of ſuch as are to give a Value to our Riches, and if without the perſonal Miniſtry of Men we cannot live, it is our Intereſt to have them in a Condition to render the ſame; if this Number liveth for us, their Condition muſt be perfect in Conſequence, that their Service may be perfect and intire. Their Bodies muſt be brought to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of natural Perfection, that their Organs may be well diſpos'd to receive the Commandments of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will, wherewith they are animated
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0135100100:4"/>for our Service and for our Preſervation, and that the Inactivity and the Defects of their Bodies may not hinder the Activity of their Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>This is the total Sum of the Obligations we lye under in Caſe we love our own Intereſt. It is therefore a pernicious Enviouſneſs in ſome, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter of ſome good Invention for ſhortening and making eaſy the Labours and Fatigues of their Fellow-Creatures, chooſe rather to keep it in their Cloſets as an idle Object of their Curioſity, than to have the Publick reap the Advantage thereof, which conſequently would be beneficial to themſelves by reaſon of the Maxim I have before, advanc'd.</p>
            <p>If ſuch an Enviouſneſs is to be blamed in reſpect of Inventions for ſhortening and making eaſy the Labours and Fatigues of Men; it is the more in reſpect of Diſcoveries tending towards the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Reſtoring of Health; and I may boldly ſay, that ſuch as are backwards therein, are in ſome Meaſure anſwerable for the Languiſhings and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of their Fellow-creatures. The Life and Health of a ſingle Perſon is more precious than all what vulgarly we underſtand under the Notion of Riches; not ſo much for reaſon of the Excellency of the Structure of a Man, but becauſe Wealth and Riches can never exiſt without a Number of People, who are to give it its Value and Eſtimation. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, it is a Chimaera and no more than Duſt; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the more this Number increaſeth, the more Value our pretended Riches are receiving, and conſequently the more richer we actually become.</p>
            <p>Few are ignorant of the great Uncertainty we labour under in Phyſicks; and I ſhould think, it would not be out of the Way, if Phyſicians would follow the Example of Painters, who for the more excelling in their Art have divided themſelves in ſeveral Branches. Some apply themſelves only to Painting of Faces, ſome of Landſkips, ſome of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0135100100:5"/>Pieces, and even ſome only to paint Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this Way each one cometh to a Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The Object of Phyſick being the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preſerving of our Health, a Conſideration far ſurpaſſing all others of what Nature ſoever, it is evident, that the Art of Phyſick, inſtead of being founded only upon Probabilities, would attain to a Degree of Certainty, if each Phyſician would direct his Attention only to certain Diſeaſes and publiſh the Diſcoveries made in Curing them. <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant, omnes vincuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt ableſt Phyſicians do acknowledge that oftentimes they are at a Loſs in forming a ſolid Judgment of the Diſeaſes of their Patients; and I am ſure, that not ſeldom the Remedy preſcribed in ſuch a Perplexity is worſe than the Diſeaſe itſelf. Why do we refuſe then to make Uſe of Magnetical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies experienc'd by our Anceſtors and left by them upon Record to Poſterity? and why do we refuſe to make a farther Enquiry into the Virtues of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies? The Uſe thereof would at leaſt never be detrimental, nor is there to be apprehended, that the Practice of ſuch Remedies is liable to prove more fatal than the Diſeaſe itſelf.</p>
            <p>A great deal more could be ſaid in Praiſe of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Cures, but as <hi>Experientia ſemel inſtituta plus valet quam mille rationes,</hi> I appeal to the Authors quoted in this Treatiſe, and content myſelf to have fulfill'd the Duty every Body lyeth under, which is, to contribute proportionably to the Happineſs of others in caſe we pretend to be happy ourſelves. And as the Method diſcover'd for curing Wounds without Pains and without an immediate Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Remedies, hath been ſufficiently experienc'd, and always found to anſwer the Purpoſe, I hope it will be receiv'd with the ſame Candour as it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE VIRTUE and Efficient CAUSE OF MAGNETICAL CURES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is needleſs, to give a Definition of what is underſtood by Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cures. Since the Invention of a certain Powder made of Vitriol calcin'd, or rather exſiccated by the Reverberation of the Sun-beams, commonly call'd <hi>Sympathetical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> People ſeem almoſt to be convinc'd, that there is another Way for Curing, chiefly certain Wounds, than by an immediate Application of certain Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Part afflicted. Only the Difference lieth herein, that a great many either out of Prevention, or perhaps ſometimes out of Ignorance or Self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſtiffly maintain, that the Cauſe of ſuch Cures is in nothing elſe to be look'd for, than in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0135100100:7"/>of certain People. Some go ſtill farther, and do aſcribe the Virtue to certain Ceremonies and even to Charms. Of the laſt Opinion are at th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Day few, more of the firſt; and it ſeems, as if this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was ſupported by the Experience itſelf made by many People, with the ſaid Sympathetical Powder to no Purpoſe; which hath given Room to them to ſay, that the Effects of this Powder, if there are any, are only viſible according to the more or leſſer Share of Superſtition, the Perſon is poſſeſs'd with, who maketh Uſe thereof. Moreover the little Practice made with this Powder, tho' nothing at all expenſive, and though the Advantage of Novelty it hath, is again an other Argument by which they ſtrive to evidence, that there is no relying at all on this Remedy.</p>
            <p>In my Opinion both Parties are equally to be blamed. The one, for aſcribing to a Thing more than really is in it, or can be produced by its Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, though all imaginable Care is taken in the Preparation of it; and the other, for deriding every Thing they are not able to comprehend with their Senſes. My Intention is therefore here, to conſider on the efficient Cauſe of Magnetical Cures, which will be a Means to prove the Poſſibility there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and this being done, I ſhall conclude with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing for the Good of the Publick, a Method to be depended upon, and hitherto kept as a Secret in private Families, for magnetically curing certain Wounds without Pains and without the Application of any Remedy.</p>
            <p>There is a Kind of Affection between all and every Thing, by Virtue of which, they alter or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one another without a viſible Touching. The daily Experience convinceth us thereof, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth it,
<q>Oſtendi Solem poſtulat ille ſibi.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0135100100:8"/>
            <p>The Examination and Knowledge of theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and hidden Virtues in Nature, is call'd natural Magick, founded upon the Sympathies of Things, and who is acquainted with the Concord or Diſcord therein, is call'd ſkilful in Magicks, and able to produce many marvelous Effects, appearing to the Vulgar to be contriv'd by the Help of Daemons; though this Myſtery is nothing elſe, but a Science of the Sympathies and Antipathies between ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and inferiour Things.</p>
            <p>Sympathy is a mutual Conſent between Phyſical and Natural Things, by which they friendly embrace one another, call'd by ſome a Compaſſion. <hi>Galen</hi> uſeth the Word of Friendſhip, <hi>Pliny</hi> Concord, and <hi>Tully</hi> a Conveniency and natural Continuation; for though the Bodies of Iron and a Loadſtone are diſtant from one another, nevertheleſs Nature is alſo continued in them, that they agree or meet in one. The ſame calleth it an Affinity in Nature, and <hi>Bapt. Porta</hi> a Conſent; by others it is metaphorically named a Symphony or Harmony. Antipathy is a mutual Affection between Things, by virtue of which they ſhun, abhor, or are againſt one another. <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> are calling it a Fighting and Diſcord; others a Diſſenting, Enmity, Variance and Hatred; others a Reſiſtance, as hindering or reſiſting Actives to be applied to Paſſives.</p>
            <p>As from the Sympathy of ſuperiour and celeſtial Virtues ariſeth a Drawing, <hi>(attractio)</hi> and conveying <hi>(deductio)</hi> to the Terrene and inferiour Body, alſo from Antipathy a Reſiſtance; <hi>Plato</hi> calls therefore Magick the Attraction or Drawing of one Thing from another, cauſed by an Affinity in Nature.</p>
            <p>Now all the Parts of this World, or all the Members of one Animal, depending from one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Principle, are joyned together by one and the ſame Nature. In us, the Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver and the Reſt draw ſomething from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0135100100:9"/>and mutually aſſiſt one another; alſo that if one of them ſuffereth, the Others are likewiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or compatiſing. The ſame it is in reſpect of all the Bodies in this World joined together; they likewiſe ſerve and are ſerved mutually by one another; and from this common Alliance, or Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ariſeth a common Love, and from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Love a common Attraction or Drawing. This is the Reaſon, that the Loadſtone draws Iron unto it, and the Sun many Flowers: This is the Reaſon that <hi>Heliotropium</hi> turneth with the Sun both at Riſing and going down, and <hi>Selinetropium</hi> with the Moon.</p>
            <p>We ought to conſider Sun, Moon and the reſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terrene Quality; and Stones, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and Animals according to the celeſtial Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſo we will find, that what is above, hath Connexion with what is below, and what is below, with what is above. For, by the fatal Law given by our Creator, the terrene Body is to ſerve the celeſtial; and as every individual Part of the firſt is endued with a Matrix adapted to bring forth its like, ſo the laſt is appointed to animate it continually with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Subſtance, which is able to cauſe its engendering and begetting without Intermiſſion. The Sympathy and Antipathy, ſo notable in Animals, Minerals and Vegetables, is therefore to nothing elſe to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, than to the Influence of the celeſtial Bodies; and their Impreſſion according to the Conſtitution of each Species and individual Being, either in general or ſometimes according to the ſingular Fabrick of one Species in particular. Alſo a Saphire, to ſpeak generally, is no where offenſive to the Eyes; but nevertheleſs there hath been found one who did ſtrike the Sight of the Eye by the firſt Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But by what Means ſome natural Things join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is very difficult to demonſtrate out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0135100100:10"/>Philoſophy. Becauſe what is joyned or coupled to a Thing, is of the ſame Being or Eſſence, or is of the Quality of this Being; or is in it, as the Form is in the Subject, or appertains to it or toucheth it either like a Thing tranſmuting, in reſpect to what is tranſmuted, or like Art in reſpect of the Subject Matter. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have clearly expounded to us five Things faſten'd or knit together; Heaven and Earth, Earth and Voidneſs, a bottomleſs Gulph and Darkneſs, the Spirit of God and the Waters, Light and Bodies. The firſt Way of this Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is ſignified by the Earth empty and void. For an empty and void Earth is its Matter before it is ſupply'd with a Form from elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Way of Connexion is ſignified by Darkneſs all over the Face of the bottomleſs Gulph.</p>
            <p>The third by Light ſpringing up, riſing, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Bodies.</p>
            <p>The fourth, by Heaven and Earth; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined to the other, as Actives to Paſſives, or as a Thing tranſmuting, to what is to be tranſmuted.</p>
            <p>The fifth, by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee, how this is in us. Earth is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Body, empty of Life, void of Senſe; above it are Darkneſs, Dulneſs, Death, Stupidity, and no Feeling.</p>
            <p>Light is Life, which quickeneth, moveth, ſtirreth, and giveth Senſe to it.</p>
            <p>Heaven is the Soul and the Spring of this Light.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God is the Underſtanding, the Brightneſs of the divine Countenance. The Reaſon of this Joyning, or Connexion is this: The Body is void in itſelf, hath its Darkneſs; then it is joined to Light, through Light to Heaven, through Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a ſpiritual Subſtance, as appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Here we ſee in what Order Things created are knit together. Here we ſee the Bond and Knot of the Natural Benevolence. But what Philoſophy is this you will ſay? Certainly not a vulgar one, which judgeth of Things by Senſe, Matter and manifeſt Qualities; but a heavenly, more ſubtile and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraſe one.</p>
            <p>Body and Soul being Subſtances very far diſtant from one another, there was need of a mean Bond to join theſe diſtant Subſtances together, and to this Purpoſe is that thin and ſpiritual ſmall Body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, which Phyſicians, as well as Philoſophers, call Spirit. This copulating Spirit is more excellent than the Elements, and even anſwers to Heaven. <hi>Ariſtoteles</hi> ſpeaks of this Proportion thus: Like as all the Virtue of the Heavens is conveyed to the Earth by the Vehicle of Light; alſo all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Life, Motion and Senſes are, by the Help of this bright Spirit, convey'd and transferr'd to the terrene Body. That all what I have ſaid, may be more convincing, I ſhall produce ſome memorable Examples of <hi>Antipathys</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathys,</hi> which Authors of no little Authority have left to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all we meet with a notable Antipathy in Poiſons; not every Antidote reſiſts all Sorts of Poiſon, according to <hi>Galen.</hi>—<hi>de Antid.</hi> Each Kind of Poiſon hath its particular Antidote.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scythians</hi> were uſed to beſmear their Arrows, and Sabres, with a certain Poiſon compos'd of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood, and a Matter coming out of Putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; corrupt and filthy Blood of Vipers; a ſlight
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0135100100:12"/>Wound with an Inſtrument alſo prepared was dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and nothing could help but <hi>Cantharides,</hi> which, againſt all other Poiſons is ineffectual, according to <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to <hi>Pliny,</hi> there is no greater Poiſon for Trees than wild <hi>Parſnip,</hi> becauſe, being near them, it taketh not only all the Subſtance away, but it boreth and pierceth Holes, like as with a Sword, through the very Roots of the Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen,</hi> I. de Theriaca ad <hi>Piſon.</hi> affirms, that a Herb call'd <hi>Trifoly</hi> boiled and applied to Bitings of Vipers, is to take immediately away all Pains; but if apply'd on ſound People, that it cauſeth the ſame Pains People ſuffer being bit by Vipers. <hi>Scaliger</hi> endeavours to give a Reaſon of this Myſtery, but it is more according to the Subtilty of his Genius than a true one. So much of Poiſons.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay of the invincible Hardneſs of a Diamond, which contemptibly withſtands the two greateſt; Forces in Nature; and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yields to Goat's Blood, being ſteep'd therein when it is freſh and warm?</p>
            <p>Is not this a ſurprizing Example of a natural Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance or Diſcord? By what Ingenuity hath this been found out? By what Accident, or what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture was there only to experiment ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Secret, chiefly in a Goat, the filthieſt of all Animals?</p>
            <p>A Lion, feared by all Animals, and who careth neither Tyger nor Bear, is, notwithſtanding aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Sight of a far weaker Animal, a Cock. Do you aſk the Reaſon thereof? Perhaps there is a certain Strength in the Eyes of a Cock, as ſome think, repugnant to the Eyes of a Lion. Certainly we cannot look for the Reaſon of it in the Matter or Senſes, otherwiſe we would fall into endleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities; but we muſt look for it in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Things above us. I remit my Readers to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0135100100:13"/>
               <hi>Proclus</hi> in his Book of <hi>Magicks,</hi> where he giveth a Reaſon, <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> of this ſeeming Prodigy.</p>
            <p>Who knows not the Diſcord between a Spider and a Toad or Serpent? The firſt, perceiving one of the laſt under the Shade of a Tree, after having it artfully entangled in its Web, pierceth its Brains with ſuch a Force, that it is no more able to diſentangle itſelf from its Priſon; nor dothit find an End thereof till it is dead.</p>
            <p>The Antipathy between an Aſh-Tree and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, hath been ſo much experimented, that we know from thence, that a Serpent will always ſhun, even the Morning and Evening Shade of this Tree, and fly from it ſo far, that a Fire being made on one Side, and on the other a Semi-Circle of Leaves and Branches of an Aſh-Tree, it rather will jump, and endeavour to eſcape through the Fire, than paſs the Aſh-Tree.</p>
            <p>I proceed to Vegetables, where equally we meet with an evident and notable Diſcord. For an Oak-Tree will not proſper in Places where Olives grow; and an Olive-Tree leaveth in Groves of Oaks, ſuch offenſive Roots, which actually do kill the Oak-Trees. The ſame being planted near Wallnut-Trees, either dieth itſelf or remains always weak, or cauſeth the ſame Effects in the Wallnut.</p>
            <p>The Hatred between Colewort or Cabbage and Vines, is more viſible. For a Vine with its crooked Tendrels doth tye and bind itſelf to every Thing that it doth catch, only it refuſeth the ſame to Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, and being near it, it bends to the oppoſite Side. Colewort or Cabbage being boiling, if only a few Drops of Wine are pour'd upon it, will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ceaſe to boil, and the Cabbage will loſe its Colour. The ſame will dry through and through, if <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamen,</hi> a Kind of Briony or Origan, or wild Marjorum is near it; and Vines will become worſe in the Neighbourhood of Bay-Trees.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0135100100:14"/>
            <p>There is ſuch an Antipathy between a Crab and Polypody, that this Herb being apply'd, will cauſe its throwing off the Shell wherewith it is covered, or at leaſt its Claws. Fern and Reeds are ſo repugnant to one another, that neither of them will ſuffer the other near it, which is the Reaſon that we neither find Fern in Places where Reeds grow, nor Reeds in Ferny Grounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homer, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> do report, that Alyſſon, St. John's Wort and Rue, or Herbgrace, are of ſuch a natural Repugnancy againſt malignant Spirits, that like Heads of Wolves affixed to Gates, ſo theſe Herbs hang'd up in Houſes, do ſecure Men and Beaſts againſt all kinds of Sorcery or Poiſon. <hi>Homer,</hi> who by his Travels got a great Skill in Magicks, relateth, that <hi>Mercurius</hi> arm'd <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> againſt the Inchantments of <hi>Circe</hi> by the uſe of Rue or Herbgrace. And in the Hiſtory of <hi>Toby,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us by Sacred Writ, we find, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel taught <hi>Toby</hi> to take Part of the Heart of a Fiſh drawn out of the River, and to caſt it upon Coals; the Smoke of which was to rid Men and Women of all kinds of Demons. We ought therefore not to call in Queſtion the like Amulets, grounded on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſons, ſince a certain Subſtance is iſſuing out from them, which according to Experience is capable effectually to repair the Strength of Bodies, and to reſiſt Poiſons or any thing elſe that is offenſive.</p>
            <p>THE Root of white Peony, and the Hoof of an Elk, are of an Antipathy againſt the Falling Sickneſs; the Seed of Melanthium, againſt Rheums or falling down of raw Humours; Wolf's Dung againſt Colicks; not by virtue of Charms, as ſome very ignorantly think, but becauſe ſome Vapours like Atoms iſſue from their Subſtance, which ſent forth to the Brain, do dry it, and alter the Cauſe of the Sickneſs by their own Virtue. <hi>Galen,</hi> after many
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0135100100:15"/>Trials, ſpeaks thereof: That we are to depend upon the like Amulets, as working by their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not by the virtue of imaginary Charms, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>de Simplic. Medic.</hi>

            <p>The Hand of a Fiſherman is ſtupify'd, as ſoon as he toucheth a Fiſh call'd the <hi>Cramp Fiſh,</hi> though it be with a long Pole. A little Fiſh, half a Foot in length, call'd a <hi>Suckſtone</hi> or <hi>Sea Lamprey,</hi> cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Keel of a Ship, hindreth the Courſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though Wind and Weather is favourable. This is not done by virtue of Charms, but by Reaſons I have juſt now mention'd. It is certainly a ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Miracle of Nature, that ſuch a ſmall Fiſh is capable to ſtay a like Bulk, and to hinder the Courſe of a great Ship, though in full Sail, by no other means, than by cleaving to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that the imperial Ship, wherein <hi>Antony</hi> did intend to circuit and to exhort his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was ſtay'd by ſuch a Fiſh; and that he was oblig'd to go into another Ship, mean while that his Fleet was driven a great way off. <hi>Caius</hi>'s Gally bound for <hi>Antium,</hi> an ancient City in <hi>Italy,</hi> and rowed by four hundred Hands, had the ſame Fate; and it ſeems this Fiſh to be ominous, ſince this Prince, ſoon after his coming back, was deadly wounded. There was no longer Room to dive into the reaſon of this Staying, as ſoon as this Fiſh was found cleaving to the Stern of the Ship. But being brought into the Ship, it proceeded; and it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to be admir'd, why it was able to ſtay the Ship by cleaving to it, and could not do the ſame after being brought into the Ship. We muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Nature here is intricate, and cannot be underſtood by our Senſes. For beſides what I have ſaid, it ſeems as if ſhe knowing of an approaching Danger did intend to remove it. The Ship wherein the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Periander</hi> were ſent, for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0135100100:16"/>having the noble Boys gelded, was ſtay'd in its Courſe; as if Nature did judge it deteſtable to rob Men of what is given them to their Preſervation. The Ship of <hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> not long after aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Rome,</hi> was ſtay'd, as if Nature commiſerating <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Fate, would keep him back from this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and hinder his unhappy Courſe. As much of <hi>Sea Lampreys.</hi>

            <p>A kind of Spider that hath in his Legs three Knots or Joints, whoſe Sting is perilous and deadly, called Phalangium, immediately dieth by touching a certain Herb we know by the Name of Crocis.</p>

            <p>The ancient Hiſtory doth report of <hi>Aemilianus Scipio,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Africanus Minor,</hi> that he opened the Gates of <hi>Carthage</hi> with a peculiar Herb, and dry'd Moors and fenniſh Places With Aethiopis, an Herb before mentioned: And who hath ever come near all the hidden Virtues of Nature?

            <p>The Preſence of a Diamond hindereth the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to draw Iron unto it, and the Preſence of Oil hindereth Amber to draw Straw unto it. And if we conſider the Enmity between things to hurt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is not unlikely, that our Anceſtors did infer from thence, that perhaps ſome Remedy for their own uſe might lie concealed under it; the Succeſs hath anſwer'd their Conjectures, and we are oblig'd to reverence likewiſe ſomething hidden in Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies which is of a confederate Virtue either to keep at a diſtance, or to expel ſomething that is bad.</p>

            <p>Every Day we meet with a notable Concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Herbs and the celeſtial Bodies. We are aſſur'd of the ſolar Preſence by the Flowers of an Herb call'd <hi>Cichoreum, Succory,</hi> which at the Riſing of the Sun openeth, and at its Setting cloſeth itſelf up again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lapinus</hi> a Kind of Pulſe, is daily turn'd about with the Sun, alſo that the Sky being cloudy, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen know by it, what o' Clock it is. The Herb Mallows conforms itſelf likewiſe to the Motion of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Authors of no ſmall Credit unanimouſly affirm that Thunder and Lightning never hurts a Bay or Fig-tree, nor an Hide of a Sea-calf, or Hyaena, nor a white Vine. <hi>Octavius Aguſtus</hi> therefore arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the laſt, and <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> by wearing a Crown made of Bay-leaves, ſecur'd, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Thunder; becauſe theſe Things are not only of a Nature to refiſt the Vehemency of Lightning, but alſo to throw back the Blaſts of it. There is a wonderful Sympathy between Metals and the Miners-Rod, or a little Twig with two Branches cut off a Haſle-tree, by the Help of which Miners ſearch after Gold and Silver Veins. It would be in vain to ſeek for the Cauſe thereof in the manifeſt Qualities.</p>
            <p>The Sympathy ſubſiſting between Stones and the celeſtial Bodies is ſtill greater: Their Power is more extenſive than that of Herbs; becauſe they ſeem not only to command the celeſtial Bodies, but alſo Men. Who is ignorant of the Pilot's Needle, a Piece of Iron rubb'd with the Load-ſtone, always pointing to the Arctic Pole? Selenites, a Stone found in <hi>Arabia,</hi> hath a White in it, which decreaſeth and increaſeth as the Moon doth.</p>
            <p>A Turquois, according to <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> doth change and wax very pale, being worn by a ſick or decaying Perſon; but it is more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, that the precious Colour of this Stone is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0135100100:20"/>chang'd into a ſooty and ſmoaky one, or receiveth ſome Spots, or appears to be chink'd, when there is a conſiderable Danger approaching the Perſon it is worn by.</p>
            <p>And for Antipathies, the ſame Authors do report, that the Emerald effectually doth reſiſt Fevers and Poiſons; and that it breaks, being overcome by Poiſon.</p>
            <p>Androdamas, a precious Stone, hard and heavy, bright like Silver, and in form of divers little Squares, putteth away the Fury of Anger, and Rage of Letchery.</p>
            <p>Genianes, a precious Stone, procureth Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Man's Enemy.</p>
            <p>Dendritis, a precious Stone, which, being put under a Tree, maketh that the Ax in cutting it ſhould hot be dull'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Siderites,</hi> a Stone like Iron, hath Power to cauſe Variance amongſt Men. No doubt, theſe Stones do actually ſpout or drive out an inviſible hidden Power. And though they are ſolid Things, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the native Heat and Rubbing and Touching draws out a Virtue, which it communicateth to the Heart and Brains. There are Medicines of a great Uſe by Reaſon of their Reſemblance, we ſee them daily prevail againſt many Diſeaſes for no other Reaſon but becauſe the have one another's Anatomy and <hi>Signatura.</hi> This is a Way of making Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations by Reſemblance, by which the Creator of all Things oftentimes diſcovereth ſublime and hidden Things to inſtruct us by the Idea of their Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to what they have been from the Beginning deſtinated.</p>
            <p>All Herbs, Flowers, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are magical Signs granted by their Author, the Knowledge Whereof brings us to the true Phyſick, <hi>i. e.</hi> Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; becauſe the Signs externally diſcover'd by Nature, are Tokens of certain internally hidden Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0135100100:21"/>and that Signatum, and the inward Kernel, is always ſignify'd by the outward Phyſiognomy.</p>
            <p>What is the Reaſon, that many Diſeaſes cannot be cur'd with every Remedy? Becauſe they proceed from an aſtral Impreſſion of the Firmament, there is need of an aſtronomical Influence; that is to ſay, of Things which have an Analogy between the great and leſſer World: Herein doth conſiſt the true mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Virtue of the Firmament, and the Means to reſiſt Diſeaſes cauſed by ſuch Impreſſions. This Influence and Signatura we obſerve in ſome Plants; the notableſt and moſt evident do appear in Hyperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and Perſicaria; the firſt is pierc'd or bor'd with ſmall Holes, and the other ſpotted with red Spots, as if Blood had dropp'd upon it.</p>
            <p>The ſame Signaturae, ſo very uſeful to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſeaſes, are likewiſe to be met with in other Vegetables; and it is not ſufficient for a <hi>Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> to ſearch into the external Signaturae of Plants, their Time and Place of growing; but he ought alſo to concern himſelf about the inward Principle, and their Virtue, which is the Image of God implanted in Things created. This Principle is known by many Names; ſome call it the <hi>Balſam of Nature, vital Sulphur, radical Seed, firſt Matter;</hi> ſome <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heat, Mercury of Life, univerſal Spirit.</hi> It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is deſtroy'd in the Corruption of Things; the Elements and all mix'd Bodies being diſſolv'd, it will nevertheleſs remain. This Balſam doth occupy the whole Anatomy of Bodies in living Creatures and Plants; in ſome Animals rather a certain Part, as the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and according to the Diverſity of Impreſſions, Tincture, Abundance of Humours, Quality, and Difference, it produceth different and divers Actions. By virtue of this Balſam ſome Plants and Parts of Animals are of an Antipathy againſt Diſeaſes; and by the Virtue and Power of this Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam ſome Parts of Animals are of a Sympathy with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0135100100:22"/>ſome Parts of the human Body, aiding, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preſerving it in its radical Vigour.</p>
            <p>Who neglects this Principle, the Signature of Things, without overcoming a thorough Knowledge thereof, is unworthy of the Name of a Phyſician. If there were nothing elſe, the Knowledge of this Myſtery would make a Phyſician excel in his Art, according to what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays of thoſe, who know before-hand which can be cured, and which muſt die.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that every Diſeaſe hath its particular Signs, procuring the Knowledge thereof to us; and the ſame Signs are to be found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies alſo mark'd by Nature. We may therefore ſay in general, and with a great deal of Truth, that this Diſeaſe is a Diſeaſe for this Remedy, and this Remedy is a Remedy for this Diſeaſe. The Herb <hi>Tuſſilago</hi> is a Remedy for obſtructed Lungs, becauſe it weareth the ſame Mark. The Herbs <hi>Lingua Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina</hi> and <hi>Scolopendrium</hi> are a Remedy againſt a puff'd-up or ſwollen Milt, becauſe they repreſent the Figure of the Milt. The maketh appear, that it is poſſible to overcome a Knowledge of Nature by the Signs of the Remedies; and that the Myſtery of Sympathies and Antipathies, in reſpect of Things, as well as their Qualities, are of a vaſt Benefit for a Phyſician.</p>
            <p>Theſe who are ſkilful in this ſecret Philoſophy, and have watch'd Opportunities to experience Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Strength, are capable of producing many wonderful Effects: And as the Way of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as in many other Things, is hidden and conceal'd, the unſkilful not ſeldom aſcribe the Cauſe of their Actions to the Deluſions of Daemons; that is to ſay, to Magick call'd <hi>Goëtia,</hi> from Mourning; becauſe it is an Invocation of evil Spirits near Tombs, and German-ſiſters to Necromancy, which, for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of the Dead, requireth the Effuſion of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0135100100:23"/>humane or ſome other Blood of black Cattle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Daemons are delighted.</p>
            <p>True Magick, grounded upon natural Cauſes, is nothing elſe but a thorough Knowledge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or Diſcord between Stones, Herbs, Minerals, Animals, and the Stars, which, exactly to learn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a great deal of Wiſdom, and is in no way contrary to divine Laws.</p>
            <p>This natural Magick hath always been honour'd and approv'd of by diligent Searchers in the celeſtial and ſublunar Beings, as tending to the Admiration of the Works of God. Who is diving therein, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but overcome a Knowledge of an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Things, impoſſible to be underſtood by any other Means.</p>
            <p>It will add a great deal of Light to the further Unfolding of our Myſtery, to make mention in this Place of ſome Experiments made with Rings of Gold, Silver, Latten, or any other Metal dedicated to ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ial Bodies, whoſe Virtue one intends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to himſelf. I ſay of Rings, in whoſe Cavity is faſten'd a Stone, and under it an Herb of a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with the ſame Star. <hi>Trallianus, Gordonius, Meſue,</hi> and many others, do report, that the Virtue thereof is to rejoice the Heart, and to expel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gyges,</hi> a King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> got a Stone, taken out of the Head of a Dragon, inclos'd in his Ring, which when he turn'd to the Palm of his Hand, he could be ſeen of none; but he himſelf could ſee every one; whence the Proverb, <hi>Gygis annulus:</hi> By the Help of this Ring, it is ſaid, he flew <hi>Candaules,</hi> and committed Adultery with his Wife. <hi>Alexander Trallianus</hi> tells us, that the Image of <hi>Hercules</hi> ſtrangling a Lyon, ſet in a Ring, cureth the Cholick. The Philoſopher <hi>Eudaemus</hi> is ſaid to have prepar'd Rings againſt Stingings of Serpents, Charms, and Diſeaſes. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> reports to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0135100100:24"/>have ſeen, in the Preſence of the Emperor <hi>Veſpaſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> one <hi>Eleazar,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> apply to the Noſe of one poſſeſs'd with a Daemon a Ring, under the Seal of which was laid a Root found by <hi>Solomon;</hi> and that this <hi>Eleazar</hi> did draw out of the Noſe the Daemon, who immediately falling on the Ground, was baniſh'd by him, upon reciting <hi>Solomon</hi>'s conjuring Hymn againſt Daemons. The ſame doth tell us, that <hi>Solomon</hi> hath been very ſkilful in Magicks: And that <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Lawgiver of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did begin to learn Magicks in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he made Rings of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Forgetfulneſs:</hi> The Ring of <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> he gave to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Women to forget him, which cauſed his free returning from <hi>Egypt.</hi> This was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Help of prohibited Magick, as <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> and <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> have tax'd <hi>Moſes</hi> with, and therefore been refuted by the ſaid <hi>Joſephus;</hi> but by the Help of a thorough Knowledge of the celeſtial and ſublunar Beings, their Deſtination and Virtues. And it is known, that <hi>Empedocles, Pythagoras, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, learn'd Magicks from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts.</p>
            <p>It is therefore not generous, to call intirely in queſtion all Cures perform'd by Characters, graven Images tied to the Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is natural, and perform'd by the wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the celeſtial Bodies agreeing with our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It is not reaſonable intirely to deny Credit to what our Anceſtors, diligent Searchers in <hi>Nature</hi>'s Cloſet, have left to Poſterity, in reſpect of Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Seals, wrought at certain times, according to the Virtue and Influence of the Bodies above us, without any Superſtition, (which is fram'd only by the Ignorance of this Myſtery) without any Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or Offence to the Name of God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Violation of Faith or Religion. That this uſeful Knowledge hath in After-times been ſo very much hidden, and ſeems at this Day almoſt intirely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0135100100:25"/>loſt, can be aſcrib'd to no other Reaſon but to the Miſuſe of theſe characters. Men falling to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and not underſtanding the Reaſon of their Working, did attribute more to them than our Creator had granted, and intended to diſcover there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. I am very far off to attribute to theſe Images a Virtue in themſelves; nor do I affirm, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or Names, graven under Conſtellations, have a Virtue by reaſon of the Figure; becauſe the Figure, Number, Bigneſs, Situation, and the Solution of what is continual, are no Principles of Actions. I would intirely deny their Virtue, in caſe there were nothing elſe acting or moving, by whoſe Authority Characters are powerful. I have been oblig'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon this Subject for Reaſon to make appear what is true, it being the Perfection of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and to ſhew what Difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and phyſical Signaturae, and ſuperſtitious and unlawful ones, which, for Contemplation-ſake, we may know, but no-where but in Practice. There is no Virtue in Heaven and Earth, which hath not its Offspring from God: Alſo Medicines are viſible to the Body, Words inviſible to the Body; now if Herbs or Words are curing, the Cauſe is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in God; therefore the Herb itſelf is not the Medicine, but it is hidden in it inviſibly by God. It ſhews a great deal of Ignorance to condemn, or to deride things remote or diſtant from our Senſes, and not fit to be comprehended by them. Who is not aſtoniſh'd at the wonderful Effects of precious Stones? Nevertheleſs we cannot deny, that there is a great natural Power in them, chiefly when under certain Conſtellations certain Figures and Signatures are graved therein. It is falſe what ſome report, that the Effects of precious Stones are produced by a magical Virtue, and not by a natural one: It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the School of Magicians, who uſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, graven under certain Conſtellations,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0135100100:26"/>for a Pretext of their Inchantments. It is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that an Emerald gets looſe from the Finger at the Death of the Perſon it is worn by; and that a Stone, which comes from <hi>New Spain,</hi> known by the Name of <hi>Lapis Nephriticus,</hi> is of great Efficacy againſt the Stone in the Kidneys, if but bound to one's Arm. Who does not admire the Virtues of a <hi>Turquois?</hi> and an infinite Number of Experiments made with precious Stones, as well as Herbs, could be quoted; which if they do not every-where, and not always anſwer, nevertheleſs do not deſerve to be call'd in queſtion; becauſe not every thing doth every-where and always concur, and the Rarity or Singularity of Effects doth never take away the Cauſe in Nature; for wonderful Things in Nature are perform'd by a due Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Actives to Paſſives hereunto diſpos'd ſo cloſely and ſo ſecretly, that the Cauſe thereof ſeems exceedingly remote or diſtant. It is outragious to aſcribe every thing immediately to the Works of <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> which are remote from our Senſes, as if a hidden Virtue in Nature, the Inſtrument of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, was not able to produce many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Things without the Aſſiſtance of this Prince of evil Spirits. It is likewiſe outragious in ſuch, who intirely given to Superſtition, either out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or out of a fooliſh Doubtfulneſs, maintain the moſt evident Things to proceed from hidden Cauſes, who, beſides the Colour and Taſte, aſcribe no other Virtues to Plants; as if a particular Concord or Agreement between them and ſomething above us, was not capable to produce, beſides their firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Virtues, ſome hidden ones; witneſs the daily Experience. I take it, therefore, to be very indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet to aſſign, in ſingular Facts, no other Cauſe than what ſeems to us to be; for who can deny, that either by ſome Inſpiration, or by Chance and meer Accidents, Effects are produced ſemblable to natural
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0135100100:27"/>ones? And it is ſufficient for one, who underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or ſetteth out the Cauſes of Things natural, to have ſhew'd ſuch a ſemblable Effect to be the Effect of natural Cauſes, either always or for the moſt part, And tho' the Event doth not always anſwer, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Power and Motion in Nature is not to be denied; becauſe all Cauſes for producing one Effect do ſeldom concur, which is to be ſeen in Things, which, for reaſon of their Fewneſs, Variety, and Singularity, are conſider'd as Miracles and Prodigies; for theſe Things have natural Cauſes, but they are ſeldom diſpos'd or ready for the like Effects. If therefore the Effect is natural, the Cauſe muſt be the ſame, and alſo contrarywiſe. Now the Effects of Images, graven under the Conſtellation of certain celeſtial Bodies, are natural; conſequently the Cauſe thereof muſt likewiſe be natural. And tho' this Cauſe is hidden, and hard to be underſtood, and very remote from our outward Senſes, nevertheleſs there is no Occaſion to have recourſe to a diabolical Power; but we ought attentively to conſider by what Help, and by what Concurrence of Cauſes, ſuch an Effect is produced or not produced; and we ought rather to take an Opportunity from theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Cauſes, and the natural Effects produced by them, to acknowledge and to proclaim the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Power of God; who having evidently implanted ſuch marvellous Virtues in Nature, how wonderful muſt He appear in Things intirely hidden from us?</p>
            <p>Having ſent this before, I proceed to the Seals themſelves. The Image of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is graved in a white or clear Stone, or pure Silver or Pewter, for procuring a healthful Life, Honour and Riches.</p>
            <p>The Image of <hi>Mars</hi> againſt Timorouſneſs and Puſillanimity.</p>
            <p>The Image of <hi>Sol</hi> in pure Gold, for procuring the

            <p>The Image of <hi>Venus</hi> holding in her Hand Flowers and Apples, for procuring Mirth, Beauty and Strength to the Body.</p>

            <p>The Image of <hi>Luna,</hi> to procure Honour and Wealth, and to cure Diſeaſes afflicting the Brains. Theſe Seals are to be made under certain Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diligently and exactly to be obſerved by one skillful in Aſtrology; and as there is a great Nicety requir'd for making them, I think proper to ſend my Readers to the Authors themſelves, who have treated of theſe I have related, as well as of a great many more, in an ample manner, ſatisfactory to each one's Deſires. I proceed now to other Images and Monuments, to whom the antient Sophi and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors aſcribe a marvellous Virtue, if they are ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in convenient Stones and worn and kept with Honour and Reverence (without all manner of Superſtition.) The firſt of all are the Arcana's of the ancient and great <hi>Rhagael,</hi> who is ſaid to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd the following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Image of a comely Dragon, graved in a Ruby or any other Stone of the like nature, to have a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to increaſe Wealth, and to keep him who wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in Health and Chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>The Image of a Falcon, graved in a Topaz, to help to acquire the Benevolence of Kings, Princes and great People.</p>
            <p>The Image of an Aſtrolabium, an Inſtrument wherewith the Motions of the Stars are gathered and the Diſtance, to keep him who weareth it, healthfull and free from all Diſeaſes and unfortunate Accidents in travelling.</p>
            <p>The Figure of a Frog, graved in a precious Stone call'd Beryl, found in <hi>India,</hi> in Faſhion fix-ſquare, in Colour like Oyl or Water in the Sea, to have the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0135100100:29"/>Virtue to reconcile Enemies, and make Friendſhip amongſt Men, by touching only Perſons being at Variane.</p>
            <p>The Image of a Bat, graved in a precious Stone call'd Heliotropium, in colour green like a Leek Blade, to make him who weareth it able to reſiſt Daemons.</p>
            <p>The Image of a well-dreſs'd Man having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Hand which is handſome, being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Cornelian, to have the Virtue to ſtop Blood, and to help to Honour.</p>
            <p>The Image of <hi>Leo</hi> or <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> graven in a Stone, to reſiſt Poiſon, and to free from Agues.</p>
            <p>The Image of a Man with a Sword in his Hand, graven in a Cornelian, to preſerve the Place wherein it is, againſt Lightning and Thunder.</p>
            <p>The Image of a Man with his right Hand erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, graven in a Chalcedony, to enable him who wears it to accomodate Quarrels, to make him heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and overcome all Accidents in travelling.</p>
            <p>The Name of God being graven in a precious Stone call'd Cerauni, of a high Colour with a Star in the midſt of it, to preſerve every Place where this graven Image is, againſt Tempeſts, and to give him who weareth it Strength and Victory againſt his Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Image of an armed Man graven in a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, to render him who weareth it victorious in War. So far <hi>Rhagel.</hi>

Perceiving the Effects thereof, he compiled a Book of the Virtue of ſuch Images, amongſt which the following are the moſt notableſt. Hallowed be God, who hath given ſuch Virtues to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0135100100:30"/>the Earth for the Welfare of the human Generation. Theſe Words are to be found in the very Beginning of the Book written by the ſaid <hi>Chael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Figure of a Man ſitting behind a Plow, with a long Beard, a long Face and bent Eye-brows, four Men leaning upon his Neck, he himſelf having in his Hands a Fox and a Vulture; if ſuch a Stone in which theſe things are graven, is tyed to one's Neck, he will be able to diſcover hidden Treaſures; he will dream of Treaſures, and of the manner to overcome them. There is ſtill another Virtue to free Beaſts from Sickneſs, if they drink the Water wherein this Stone hath been waſhed. This Stone muſt be graved in the day and hour of <hi>Venus.</hi> But what Stone is muſt be, is not ſignify'd.</p>
            <p>The Image of a Man, having on his Neck a Shield, on his Head a Helmet, and in his Hand a Sword, treading under Foot a Serpent, being graven in a red Jaſper, and ty'd to the Neck, is to make him who weareth it to overcome his Enemies in a Battle, chiefly if ſuch a Battle is fought on a <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>

            <p>The Figure of a Man ſitting and a Woman ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him with her Hairs ſpread abroad, the Man looking upwards; this Figure alſo graven in a Cornelian, will procure the Benevolence of every Body touch'd therewith.

            <p>The Figure of a Baſiliſk fighting with a Dragon, and above it the Head of a Man graven in a Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and ty'd to the Neck, cauſeth him who wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to vanquiſh all kind of Beaſts, as well on Earth as in the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Figure of a naked Man puff'd up, and the Figure of another Man well dreſs'd, having in one Hand a Cup, and in the other a Bough of an herb or Plant, being graved in an Agath, has a Virtue to free from all kind of Fevers and Agues, if it is worn only for three Days.</p>

            <p>The Figure of a Serpent, above it a Man, and on the Man ſitting a Raven, being graved in a Stone, to make him who weareth it witty and prudent.</p>
            <p>The Figure of a Man ſtanding, and being cloathed with a Coat of Mail, and having a naked Sword in his Hand, being found graved in a Stone, and ſet in an Iron Ring of the ſame Weight, to cauſe him who weareth it to be irreſiſtible in War.</p>

            <p>The Image of a Man of a great Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtanding, graved in a Stone call'd Diadochus, (a Stone like a Beryl) having in the right Hand an Obolus, or an Halfpenny, and in the other a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, above him the Figure of the Sun, and under his Feet keeping a Lion proſtrate; if ſuch a Stone is ſet in a Ring of Lead with a little of Mugwort or Motherwort, and the Root of Fenugreek, it will impower him who weareth it, to call on the Shore of a River the Spirits belonging to the Waters, and to receive anſwer to what he is aſking of them.</p>
            <p>The Figure of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> (one of the Signs of the Zodiack) being graved in a green Jaſper, and worn, cauſeth Profit in buying and ſelling. A Bird carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Bill a Leaf, and the Head of a Man being in his Sight looking at the Bird, if this is graved in a precious Stone, called Pangonius, having many Angles, and ſet in Gold, is to cauſe him who wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to become rich and reſpected by every Body.</p>

            <p>The Figure of a Man on Horſeback, holding in one Hand the Bridle, and in the other a Bow bent, and girded with a Sword; if ſuch a Figure is graved in a precious Stone call'd Pyrites, before mentioned, and ſet in Gold, it is to render him who weareth it victorious in a Battle, and no body can reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>The Figure of a Woman, having her Hairs ſpread over her Breaſt, and in her Sight a Man as coming unto her and making ſome Signs of Love, being graved in a Jacinct or Cryſtal and ſet in Gold, and under the Stone a little Ambergriſe.

            <p>The Image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is a Man ſitting on a Throne or Chair with four Feet, having in one Hand a Rod, and in the other a Globe, and at his Feet an Eagle; but the Doctors of Magicks form it otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Figure of a Man with a Ram's Head, withered Heels and a little Breaſt, which being graved in a Stone, chiefly in one called Kraba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, is to make him who weareth it fortunate, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and reſpected by religious People, and to raiſe him to Honour and Dignity.</p>

The Virtue of this Image is to cauſe Succeſs in Expeditions, Honour and Wealth, a Celerity and Facility in all Undertakings and the Bringing of every Thing to the deſired End.

            <p>But why and wherefore Rings, Images and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures graved in certain Metals and Stones have the Virtues I have recited, is a Queſtion not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0135100100:45"/>by the Temperament or manifeſt Qualities, nor is it to be aſſign'd to the Subſtance itſelf, but to a Heavenly and magical One, that is to ſay, to a Superiour and mo re ſublime Cauſe, which ſome not unfitly have call'd a ſpiritual Vehicle and Bond. By the Help of it Body and Soul, Subſtance very diſtant and remote from one another, are joyned, and by the Intervention or Interceſſion of this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, the Loadſtone draweth Iron unto it, and <hi>Cichoreum</hi> follows the Motion of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Not every Philoſophical Demonſtration is to be taken from the Senſes and Qualities. A manifeſt Proof thereof is in the Colour of a white Roſe; from whence doth its Colour proceed? if you aſcribe the Cauſe thereof to a colder Temperament, what will you ſay of the Red one? A Kind of Intybus giveth a milky Juice, which you aſcribe to a cold Quality: but what will you ſay of Tithymalus, a Herb call'd Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettice, Wolfes-milk or Milk-thiſtle, which giveth likewiſe a milky Juice and is hot enough? The Bitterneſs of Aloe, you ſay, doth proceed becauſe it is of a hot Nature; but Opium, which killeth by its pernicious Coldneſs, hath likewiſe a great Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is in vain to aſcribe every Thing to the manifeſt Qualities: <hi>Scalciger</hi> calleth it a great Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſhews the Inſufficiency of ſuch Reaſons only in the ſeveral Kinds of Poiſons.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have conſider'd the Principles and Cauſes of marvelous and hidden Actions in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it remains now to make an Application of theſe Principles to the Method of Curing Wounds, I am going to publiſh.</p>
            <p>I believe every Body is convinc'd by what I have ſaid, that Plants, Roots, Stones, Metals, the Spirit and celeſtial Signs, are by a divine Law as it were partaking and conſpiring together, ſeemingly for no other Reaſon, than as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, becauſe to each
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0135100100:46"/>Species is a peculiar celeſtial Sign, like the Pole to the Loadſtone, by our Creator conſecrated and dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; alſo that each Plant, each Metal, and each pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone is of a Sympathy with a certain Star or celeſtial Sign. But the more ſublime this Poſition is, the farther we are to go back to the Beginning, and the more diligent Search we are to make therein. We do all agree that Heaven and every Thing hath been immediately created by God, and that every Thing hath received and doth keep its Virtue as well for preſerving itſelf, as for bringing forth its like. Becauſe God, who ever works by the moſt compendious Way, hath, after having given every Things its particular Virtue, appointed the Heavens for the farther continual Working thereby. Now as the Seed is endued with a vital Power, which prepareth, diſpoſeth and maketh fit the Matter for bringing forth its like, alſo, that at all Times it may receive and draw unto itſelf that animating and ſpiritual Power from Heaven, which is the very Cauſe of the Support of all what is created, we may ſay, that the Seed furniſheth the Matter, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven putteth on the Form. Alſo a Man doth beget a Man, the Man by Virtue of the Seed procureth and brings together the Apparel, and is <hi>cauſa prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ima.</hi> The Spirit and the Warmth which is in the Seed, prepareth the Matter of the Seed: firſt it cauſeth a Mingling and Tempering together conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to each ſignal Part which is to be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and then it giveth the Structure, Conformity and Poſture; laſtly it diffuſeth itſelf through all the Parts and abideth therein as a Ruler, and refuſes to forſake what it hath temper'd, form'd, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the other efficient Cauſe of a Man's Being, and indeed the Firſt and Principal one is, which giveth a Species Form or Shape to this ſingle prepar'd Matter,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0135100100:47"/>which is Heaven; for the Species of Things are caſt in by Heaven, and not by the Matter itſelf.</p>
            <p>The Sayings of the Antients: <hi>Deum per naturas eſſe diviſum,</hi> and <hi>Deorum plena eſſe omnia,</hi> are to be underſtood, that the Virtue received and infuſed by God remains in every thing; that a godly Virtue is in every thing, by whoſe Power every thing cometh forth; but otherwiſe in Heaven and otherwiſe in Things which are not able to bear up themſelves; in ſuch it is more obſcure, but in Heaven more evident and more excellent to the Generation of Things. What therefore God hath created in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, is intirely maintain'd and ruled by him; the celeſtial Ones immediately by himſelf, and the terreſtrial Ones by the Subordination of the Heavens appointed for the Procreation and Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all ſublunary Beings. The Species, Forms or Shapes of all living Creatures, Roots, Stones and Metals, which ever have been or can be, are compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Power Heaven is endued with, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing big, as it were, with an innumerable Number of Species or Forms, ingenders every thing; and by this way one Power and Faculty hath in itſelf the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of all the Bodies below. Heaven therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth without Seed many things, but no Seed is able to bring forth any thing without Heaven; but it being duly prepared and ſet in Order, Heaven caſts into it its Species and Perfection, it raiſeth up Life in every thing by the Interceding of the Bright univerſal Spirit: For this is the Carrier between Heaven and Earth, diffuſed throughout the whole Univerſe, who communicateth to all and every thing at one and the ſame Time its Species, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vital Heat accommodated to its Ingendring. It is he, who doth contain every thing, and doth cheriſh it with Heat and Life; through his Power and Help Things without Life do ſubſiſt, and animate Things
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0135100100:48"/>have a Soul according to each Kind, a nouriſhing one, ſome have a ſenſual one, and ſome a Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with or partaking of Reaſon. But this Power deſcending from Heaven, doth accommodate itſelf to every thing; it ſerveth each one with as much as its Nature deſireth, and never giveth more than the Condition of each Subject can bear. Neither is this Virtue always like unto itſelf, nor doth it always and in the ſame Manner exhibit itſelf to every thing, but variouſty according to the Station of the Stars and their different caſting forth of Beams, who for the moſt Part do vary very much, though this Carrier, I ſay, this univerſal Spirit, is always the ſame and of a not changing Subſtance.</p>
            <p>It is therefore not likely, as ſome think, that this Spirit of the World can impart to every thing Life and Form, without being in Want of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the celeſtial Bodies, or the Stars; for if this was poſſible, he would ingender always the like in one and the ſame Way, that is to ſay, in the ſame Meaſure and perpetually. For he carrieth with him a vital Soul and Nature itſelf, and maketh lively all what he entereth, but all this according to the Nature, Condition, Diſpoſition and Preparation of each Subject.</p>
            <p>It being evident by what I have ſaid, that the celeſtial Bodies do concur to the Procreation and Preſervation of all Things; and that all Parts of the World do cleave or are joyned together, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another, by this common Carrier the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit, being of a middling Subſtance between Heaven and the ſublunar Beings; and that there is no one Thing in the World ſo abject, upon which this Spirit doth not beſtow ſome Virtue and Quality, with which it is infuſed by Heaven and the celeſtial Bodies; that, as this Spirit meddleth with the bringing forth of all Things, every Thing muſt be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0135100100:49"/>comprehended in it; I ſay, as all this is evident by what I have advanced, who can doubt of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of curing Wounds without applying any Remedy, only by anointing the Inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſuch a Wound is made? Or, who can deny that ſuch Cures are natural? Certainly they can be demonſtrated out of the very Principles of Nature itſelf, and who denieth it, is either ignorant thereof, or thinks proper to meaſure every Thing with his Senſes. For theſe Cures are performed merely by Nature and a magnetical Power, Drawing <hi>(Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio)</hi> and Conveying <hi>(Deductio)</hi> the Influence of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies working by the Elements; and this ſo often mentioned Carrier the univerſal Spirit, who, as the mean Bond, induceth from proper Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Sympathy, knitting together, or Conveniency, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, out of which next a healing Virtue is derived to the Inſtrument, from whence afterwards it goeth out, and is continued and conveyed to the wounded Part; laſtly, by the Action of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Virtue, the Effect enſueth. For between the Wound and the Inſtrument is a magnetical Drawing and Conveying Power <hi>(Attractrix &amp; Deductrix);</hi> the firſt tends to the Part afflicted or the Wound, that is to ſay, the Drawing <hi>(Attractio)</hi> goeth to the wounded Part, and the conveying of the Virtue <hi>(Deductio)</hi> to the Inſtrument anointed.</p>
            <p>But there is objected, that the Space coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Time and Place doth hinder this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying or healing, and that nothing can act beyond its limited Space; moreover that it is neceſſary the Body to be healed, ſhould be touch'd by that which is to heal; and properly touching cannot be ſaid but of Things whoſe Extremities or Ends meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now ſuch a Touching doth not happen between the Wound and the Inſtrument anointed; conſequently no Cure can be perform'd.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0135100100:50"/>
            <p>Nobody will argue in this Manner but ſenſual Philoſophers: But it is very eaſy to confute their Arguments. Who knows not that many Things act at a Diſtance, whoſe Outſides, or Superficies, can never be joyned, and notwithſtanding they meet together, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun and a Man's Body; though their Superficies can never be joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nevertheleſs the Beams, being between, actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do join them; for no natural Actives can act <hi>in extremum</hi> before acting <hi>in medium,</hi> becauſe every phyſical or natural Action is performed by Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Sun warmeth the inferior World by the Orb of the Moon, though it never toucheth it, nor warmeth the Sphere of the Moon. Alſo all Bodies, between which is a Sympathy or Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, mutually affect one another, and work upon one another without any viſible Touching, that is to ſay, the Virtue of one is carried to the other by the Intervention or Interceſſion of the univerſal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; alſo, that though the Space is very great, this Virtue is nevertheleſs not alter'd nor diſpers'd by Winds, nor diſſolved by a cold and moiſt Air, but by Reaſon of its natural Communion, Accord and Bond, preſerved and continued.</p>
            <p>Alſo in Contagions, Bodies do not touch one another; and, in peſtilential Fevers, many are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected who never come near ſick People, that is to ſay, their extreme Parts do not meet: For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and corrupt Quality of theſe Fevers defileth the Bodies by propagating and diffuſing itſelf and continuing. Therefore who communicateth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Diſeaſe, needs not to touch him, but the corrupt Breath or Vapours may be ſent and hidden in Garments and other Things, (witneſs the daily Experience,) and infect another many Days after; and though we cannot properly ſay, that ſuch an infected one hath been touched by another, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0135100100:51"/>we can without Doubt affirm, that no Diſeaſe can be communicated from one to another without a Body, that is to ſay, they cannot be carried or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed without the Intervention of a ſpiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Humour. It is therefore undeniable, that there are many Actions performed without a viſible Touching, and that many Bodies act upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutually, without meeting together by the Touching of their Bodies, but of their Virtues; and this Virtue which Bodies make uſe of and put forth at a Diſtance, is a Quality without a Body, wherein the whole Power lieth. Alſo the Power iſſuing from this Ointment doth not ſpread itſelf out in the Stone, in Iron or Wood, with which it hath no Affinity, but propagateth itſelf to the Wound by Virtue of its Mover.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing which moveth in this Ointment, is the Balſamic Power hidden in the Blood and in the Moſs, which, by the Intervention of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bond, is continued to the Wound, and except the Diſtance is too great, becometh one and the ſame with it by joining both Forms. I ſay, they join, becauſe their Forms do extend themſelves, and mutually meeting they unite together. Both what moveth and what is moved, becometh one, either by an immediate Application and Joyning of both Superficies, or the Virtue of one is conveyed to the Superficies, conſequently to the Body of the other; let it be done by Light, Beams or any other hidden Quality and ſpiritual Touching. Therefore this Ointment reacheth the Wound, or is joined to the Wound as an efficient Power, or as Actives to Paſſives; or as a Thing tranſmuting or altering to a Body to be tranſmuted: In the ſame manner Heaven is joyned to Earth, which nevertheleſs according to its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies is not contiguous with it, that is to ſay, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0135100100:52"/>Extremities of Heaven and Earth do not touch one another.</p>
            <p>The vulgar phyſical Canons are therefore not to be underſtood without Exceptions, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Extremities of Actives and Paſſives do always touch one another; and that Actives have no Power upon Paſſives, except their ſuperficial Outſides or Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities touch together. For the Quality, or the celeſtial and magnetical Virtue by the Help of this conveying Spirit, is in the Ointment, the Cauſe, and as it were the Vehicle, which being moved, the Thing to be carried is likewiſe moved. In the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle is required, that it may be apt for carrying, and for carrying is nothing more apt than the celeſtial magnetical Virtue; which, as it were, intercedeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Inſtrument and the wounded Place, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and directing every Thing for obtaining the deſir'd Effect. For between this Virtue and Vehicle is firſt of all a Sympathy, which afterwards is conveyed to the Inſtrument; from thence to the Wound by Reaſon of the Familiarity and Similitude; for this is the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe, why Things are wrapp'd and ty'd together. Therefore nobody can deny, that there is a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Inſtrument and the Wound, though it is not performed immediately by joyning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities together, becauſe there is no Neceſſity for it in this Myſtery. The Principles which are acting in this Caſe not being corporeal, there is likewiſe no corporeal Touching required. The Virtue is brought to the Wound mediately by interceding (as I have often repeated) of a more ſublime and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Power, which the Doctors of natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks have called a magnetical one.</p>
            <p>It remains nothing but to give a Deſcription of the Ointment wherewith magnetical Cures of Wounds without Pains, and without an immediate Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Remedy, are performed. <hi>Baptiſta Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0135100100:53"/>giveth a Deſcription of ſome ſuch Compoſition, and introduceth <hi>Paracelſus</hi> for its Author: But this Compoſition is very defective, as every body may ſee by comparing it to the following. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it hath been contradicted by many, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> could be the Author thereof, which joyn'd to the Credulity wherewith the ſaid <hi>Porta</hi> hath col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and publiſhed a great many Compoſitions, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to be depended upon, giveth Room to believe, that he was unable to aſſure the Veracity of his Deſcription by any other means than by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>Paracelſus</hi> for its Author. I believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the following Deſcription will be the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, as by long Experience of different Perſons it hath been found to anſwer the End for which it is deſign'd.</p>
            <p>The Deſcription is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Sanicle (Lat. Sanicula)</hi> which is ſpotted, and hath the Signature of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Bugle (Lat. Conſolida media, Buglum, Bugla, Bugula)</hi> both being gathered freſh, and dryed in the Shade, and afterwards made to Powder; you take of each one Ounce.</p>
            <p>Oil of Linſeed.</p>
            <p>Turpentine.</p>
            <p>Armeniac Bolus, of each two Drachms.</p>
            <p>Human Fat, four Ounces.</p>
            <p>Genuine Mummy.</p>
            <p>Human Blood, being yet warm.</p>
            <p>Of the Moſs which groweth upon the Skull of a Man, being hanged and left hanging; of each one Ounce.</p>
            <p>All being well mixed in a Mortar, muſt be kept cloſe in a Glaſs or earthen Veſſel with a narrow Neck, being glazed within.</p>
            <p>The whole is to be made when the Sun doth exiſt in <hi>Libra;</hi> but the Moſs is to be gathered when the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0135100100:54"/>Moon increaſeth and doth exiſt in the Houſe of <hi>Venus</hi> if poſſible, not in <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars.</hi> If you cannot expect the Moon's exiſting in the Houſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> you are diligently to obſerve when <hi>Luna</hi> is in the Sign of <hi>Piſces,</hi> to gather the Moſs at that time, becauſe this Sign is the moſt convenienteſt by reaſon of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Dwelling Place, and <hi>Venus</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation; the next after it is <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Libra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Ointment alſo prepared, all manner of Wounds given by Inſtruments, either pierced, or ſtricken, or blown, are cured, if only the Inſtrument can be had; but ſuch Wounds are excepted where the Arteries or ſome of the principal Members, as the Heart, Brains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are hurted.</p>
            <p>The Inſtrument with which the Wound is made, or in want thereof, a piece of Wood or a little Bough of Willow, ſteeped in the bloody Opening, is to be plunged in the Ointment and therein to be left: The wounded Perſon, meanwhile, hath only to waſh the Wound daily once with his Urine or freſh Water, and to cover it with a piece of clean Linen, always wiping away the Filth, and the Wound will heal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate without any Pains. If the Inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Wound is made cannot be had, another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is to be ſteeped in the Wound, and after it is anointed on both Sides with this Inſtrument, it is to be kept in a clean and temperate Place, becauſe if it is expoſed to the Air or too much Cold, the Wound will begin to ſmart. It is likewiſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, if the Wound is made edgling or pointingly. In the laſt Caſe the Inſtrument is to be anointed from the Point towards the Handle; in the firſt, from the Edge towards the Back; and in all Caſes the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is diligently to be cover'd. If it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how deep the Inſtrument hath been in the Wound, all is to be anointed, but if it appears, only the Part which was plunged in the Wound.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0135100100:55"/>
            <p>As for the Moſs growing upon the Skull of a Man being hanged, it may ſeem to many to be a uſeleſs Nicety, and that perhaps any other, tho' not grown upon the Skull of a Man hanged, may do the ſame. But the following Reaſon, with which I conclude, may be given for why the laſt hath a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Compoſition of this Magnetical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The vital Spirits of a Man to be ſtrangled, by reaſon of the Preſence of his unhappy Chance, do retire to the Head and Brains, and the violent Conſtriction hindereth their going back to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they remain alſo there and mingle, and are confounded with the Spirits and the Balſam of the Head and Brains; and though all animal Functions do ceaſe, nevertheleſs there remains a certain Heat or Warmneſs in the Bones, Nerves, and the other ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parts, which is in Stones and in Pepper, that is to ſay, an elemental one. Now after this Mixture, and through the help of this Heat and the joint working of a heavenly Influence, Moſs, like a Vegetable grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Skull of a Man being hang'd, muſt needs be of a greater Force than ſuch as grows upon the Head of another who dy'd of ſome Diſeaſe.</p>
