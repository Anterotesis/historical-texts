            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ART of this POEM had the Honour of your Lordſhip's Peruſal when in Manuſcript, and it was no ſmall Pride to me, when it met with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1017900500:4"/>
Approbation from ſo diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Judge: Should the reſt find the like Indulgence, I ſhall have no Occaſion (whatever its Succeſs may be in the World) to repent the Labour it has coſt me.—But my Intention is not to purſue a Diſcourſe on my own Performance; No, my Lord, it is to embrace this Opportunity of throwing out Sentiments that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to your Lordſhip's Goodneſs, the Generoſity of which, give me Leave to ſay, I have greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd.</p>
            <p>I offer it not as a new Remark, that Dependance on the Great, in former Times, generally ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in Diſappointment; nay, even their Bounty (if it could be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1017900500:5"/>
called ſuch) was in its very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ungenerous. It was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with-held thro' an indolent, or wilful Neglect, 'till thoſe, who lingered in the Want of it, grew almoſt paſt the Senſe of Comfort. At length it came, too often, in a Manner, that half cancell'd the Obligation, and, perchance, muſt have been acquired too by ſome previous Act of Guilt in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, the Conſequence of which was Remorſe and Infamy.</p>
            <p>But <hi>that I live,</hi> my Lord, is a Proof that Dependance on your Lordſhip, and the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, is an Aſſurance of Succeſs. I am perſuaded Diſtreſs, in many other Inſtances, affects your Soul with a Compaſſion, that always

ſhews itſelf in a manner moſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and active; that to forgive Injuries, and confer Benefits, is your Delight; and that to deſerve your Friendſhip is to deſerve the Countenance of the beſt of Men: To be admitted into the Honour of your Lordſhip's Converſation (permit me to ſpeak but Juſtice) is to be elegantly introduced into the moſt inſtructive, as well as entertaining, Parts of Literature; it is to be furniſh'd with the fineſt Obſervations upon human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to receive from the moſt unaſſuming, ſweet, and winning Candour, the worthieſt and moſt polite Maxims—Such as are always enforc'd by the Actions of your own Life. I could alſo take Notice of your many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-ſpirited
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1017900500:7"/>
Services to your Country in Parliament, and your conſtant Attachment to Liberty, and the Royal, Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe of our Moſt <hi>Gracious Sovereign;</hi> But, my Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, your own Deeds are the nobleſt and fitteſt Orators to ſpeak your Praiſe, and will elevate it far beyond the Power of a much abler Writer than I am.</p>
            <p>I will therefore turn my View from your Lordſhip's Virtues to the kind Influence of them, which has been ſo lately ſhed upon me; and then, if my future Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Writings ſhall gain any Approbation from Men of Parts and Probity, I muſt acknowledge all to be the Product of your
