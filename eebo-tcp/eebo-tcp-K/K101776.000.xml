            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Poems was taken from the World at the time when ſhe firſt began to meet with Encouragement to print them, and, in Compliance with her dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, they are now publiſhed for the Benefit of her Father, who is deſirous to make uſe of this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of returning his humble Thanks to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers for the Favour they have been pleaſed to ſhew him.</p>
            <p>The ſhort Account which has been given of Mrs. <hi>Leapor,</hi> with the Propoſals for a Subſcription, it is hop'd, will ſufficiently apologize for the Defects that ſhall be found in this Collection. Had ſhe lived to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and finiſh theſe firſt Productions of a young unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted Genius, certainly they would have been greatly improved, tho', as they now appear in their native Simplicity, they cannot ſurely but afford an agreeable Entertainment to the Reader, and ſerve as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proof of the common Aphoriſm, <hi>Poeta naſcitur, non fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Leapor</hi> from a Child delighted in reading, and particularly Poetry, but had few Opportunities of procuring any Books of that kind. The Author
<pb facs="tcp:0157500400:3"/>
ſhe moſt admired was Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> whom ſhe chiefly endeavoured to imitate; how far ſhe ſucceeded in this, or any other of her Attempts, muſt be left to the Judgment of the Publick. And indeed if the Poems will not recommend themſelves to the Reader, little Advantage is to be expected from any thing that can be ſaid of them here; but, in Juſtice to the Memory of the Author, as well as for the Satisfaction of all thoſe who have ſo chearfully and generouſly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to improve the beſt Legacy ſhe could bequeath to her Father, we beg leave to inform them, that her Conduct and Behaviour entirely correſponded with thoſe virtuous and pious Sentiments which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in her Poems. She was courteous and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all, chearful, good-natured, and contented in the Station of Life in which Providence had placed her. The generous and charitable Spirit that appeared in her was exerted upon all Occaſions to the utmoſt of her Ability, and was ſuch as would have been ornamental in a much higher Sphere, to which in all Probability, if it had pleaſed God to ſpare her Life, her own Merit would have raiſed her.</p>
            <p>Some of her Papers, a little time before her Death, were communicated to ſeveral Perſons of Rank and of diſtinguiſhed Taſte and Judgment, who were pleaſed to expreſs a great Satisfaction in the View they had of promoting a Subſcription for their being printed, and by that means encouraging her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in a Science ſo agreeable to herſelf, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to them; but her Friends are now left to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her Loſs, and that ſo great a Part of a ſhort and valuable Life was ſpent in Obſcurity.</p>

               <l>Whoſe Wit inſpired, and whoſe Follies charm'd:</l>
               <l>Who, with Invention, rack'd her careful Breaſt</l>
               <l>To find new Graces to inſult the reſt,</l>

While on her Cheeks the fading Roſes die,</l>
               <l>And the laſt Sparkles tremble in her Eye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Bright Sol had drove the ſable Clouds away,</l>
               <l>And chear'd the Heavens with a Stream of Day,</l>
               <l>The woodland Choir their little Throats prepare,</l>
               <l>To chant new Carols to the Morning Air:</l>
               <l>In Silence wrap'd, and curtain'd from the Day,</l>
               <l>On her ſad Pillow loſt <hi>Dorinda</hi> lay;</l>

               <l>No Pleaſures charm her, nor no Slumbers pleaſe.</l>
               <l>For if to cloſe her weary Lids ſhe tries,</l>
               <l>Deteſted Wrinkles ſwim before her Eyes;</l>
               <l>At length the Mourner rais'd her aking Head,</l>
               <l>And diſcontented left her hated Bed.</l>
               <l>But ſighing ſhun'd the Relicks of her Pride,</l>
               <l>And left the Toilet for the Chimney Side:</l>
               <l>Her careleſs Locks upon her Shoulders lay</l>
               <l>Uncurl'd, alas! becauſe they half were Gray;</l>
               <l>No magick Baths employ her skilful Hand,</l>

She ſlights her Form, no more by Youth inſpir'd,</l>
               <l>And loaths that Idol which ſhe once admir'd.</l>
               <l>At length all trembling, of herſelf afraid,</l>
               <l>To her lov'd Glaſs repair'd the weeping Maid,</l>
               <l>And with a Sigh addreſs'd the alter'd Shade.</l>
               <l>Say, what art thou, that wear'ſt a gloomy Form,</l>
               <l>With low'ring Forehead, like a northern Storm;</l>
               <l>Cheeks pale and hollow, as the Face of Woe,</l>
               <l>And Lips that with no gay Vermilion glow?</l>

               <l>But now a Spectre in its room appears,</l>
               <l>All ſcar'd with Furrows, and defac'd with Tears;</l>
               <l>Say, com'ſt thou from the Regions of Deſpair,</l>
               <l>To ſhake my Senſes with a meagre Stare?</l>
               <l>Some ſtragg'ling Horror may thy Phantom be,</l>
               <l>But ſurely not the mimick Shape of me.</l>
               <l>Ah! yes—the Shade its mourning Viſage rears,</l>
               <l>Pants when I ſigh, and anſwers to my Tears:</l>
               <l>Now who ſhall bow before this wither'd Shrine,</l>

               <l>BENEATH a Mountain's ſolitary Shade</l>
               <l>Liv'd <hi>Catharina,</hi> then an ancient Maid,</l>
               <l>An uſeful Dame that ev'ry Simple knew,</l>
               <l>And from choice Herbs exhal'd a cordial Dew.</l>
               <l>Rude was her Dome, and hid from prying Eyes,</l>
               <l>By lofty Hills that ſeem'd to reach the Skies;</l>
               <l>Deep in a Rock the winding Cavern run,</l>
               <l>A bending Cypreſs skreen'd it from the Sun:</l>
               <l>From its rude Side a Fountain us'd to flow,</l>
               <l>That pour'd inceſſant on the Stones below:</l>

                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0157500400:211"/>
This Muſick lull'd the penſive Dame to Reſt,</l>
               <l>And drew ſoft Slumbers on her aching Breaſt:</l>
               <l>No Sun was there, nor ſcarce a dawning Gleam,</l>
               <l>No twinkling Stars, nor <hi>Cynthia</hi>'s ſilver Beam.</l>
               <l>There naked Elms and ſapleſs Oaks appear'd,</l>
               <l>With Age grown rotten, and by Light'ning ſear'd;</l>
               <l>There perch'd the Raven and the gray-ey'd Owl,</l>
               <l>With his wiſe Viſage and his ſerious Scowl;</l>
               <l>No Flow'rets there bedeck the moſſy Ground,</l>
               <l>But a thick Foreſt ſpread its Shade around,</l>
               <l>Where the ſmooth Box and browner Haſel grew,</l>
               <l>The ſolemn Pine-tree and the baleful Yew:</l>
               <l>Here no glad Sound was heard nor human Tongue,</l>
               <l>Not <hi>Colin</hi>'s Flute nor <hi>Blouzelinda</hi>'s Song:</l>
               <l>Theſe gloomy Shades for Grief were only made,</l>
               <l>And howling Wolves that ſcamper'd thro' the Glade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here <hi>Catharina</hi> ſpent her irkſom Days,</l>
               <l>Secluded both from Envy and from Praiſe.</l>
               <l>Not ſo her laughing Moments us'd to run,</l>
               <l>When her bright Eyes were like a Morning Sun:</l>
               <l>When to her Flock repair'd the gazing Swains,</l>
               <l>Her Flock was then the faireſt of the Plains:</l>

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0157500400:212"/>
And ſhe no leſs—with Veins of ſprightly Blue,</l>
               <l>And Cheeks like Roſes wrap'd in Morning Dew,</l>
               <l>The Loves and Graces round her Features flew.</l>
               <l>Her Mind was chearful as the riſing Day,</l>
               <l>Mature as Summer and as <hi>April</hi> gay;</l>
               <l>Yet Fate too ſoon eclips'd her early Joy,</l>
               <l>She fell the Victim of the winged Boy,</l>
               <l>The winged Boy that bears the fatal Darts:</l>
               <l>Henceforth may Virgins better guard their Hearts.</l>
               <l>'Twas <hi>Celadon,</hi> 'twas he that caus'd her Pain,</l>
               <l>The faireſt Shepherd of the rural Train;</l>
               <l>Whoſe careleſs Beauty made her Heart his Prize,</l>
               <l>And ſtole the Slumbers from her wakeful Eyes.</l>

               <l>Long time her Pride and cooler Reaſon ſtrove</l>
               <l>Againſt the Power of encroaching Love,</l>
               <l>In vain—her Cheeks and mournful Eyes declare</l>
               <l>The ſmother'd Paſſion and the ſecret Care,</l>
               <l>While the dull Youth, whom Beauty ne'er cou'd pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Who ſought no more than Indolence and Eaſe,</l>
               <l>Rang'd o'er the Vallies with his darling Tray,</l>
               <l>Or near ſome Fountain ſlumber'd out the Day:</l>

All Nymphs he ſtrove (but moſtly her) to ſhun,</l>

               <l>Strange Paſſions labour'd in her penſive Breaſt;</l>
               <l>She loſt her Crook—her Flocks no more were told,</l>

               <l>The Tyrant view'd her with a ghaſtly Look,</l>
               <l>His Heart beat heavy, and his Sinews ſhook;</l>
               <l>When lo a Spectre horrible to view,</l>
               <l>Roſe quick as Vapours of a Morning Dew;</l>
               <l>Whoſe Preſence caſt unpleaſing Darkneſs round,</l>
               <l>A Cypreſs Wreath his faded Temples crown'd:</l>
               <l>Strange Forms were painted on his ſable Robe,</l>
               <l>One Hand extended bore a cryſtal Globe;</l>
               <l>Where the pale Sinner might his Picture find,</l>
               <l>Yet not his Features, but his darker Mind:</l>

In vain to ſhun the faithful Glaſs he tries,</l>
               <l>It plays unask'd before his aking Eyes:</l>
               <l>His quick left Hand with this perform'd its Part,</l>
               <l>His Right was dreadful with a poiſon'd Dart:</l>
               <l>Then with a loud and horrid Voice he cry'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lyſegus,</hi> mourn thy Cruelty and Pride:</l>
               <l>From the fair Court of Equity I came,</l>
               <l>Call'd by thy Sins, and Conſcience is my Name:</l>
               <l>This venom'd Dart ſhall now thy Entrails tear,</l>
               <l>And teach thy Eyes to know the melting Tear:</l>
               <l>Prepare thy Spirits for their Weight of Woe,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Celia</hi>'s Name I arm the dreadful Blow:</l>
               <l>He ſaid and ſtruck—the viſionary Dart</l>
               <l>Sought the dark Bottom of <hi>Lyſegus'</hi> Heart:</l>
               <l>He fell—and falling rais'd a fearful Cry;</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Mira</hi> 'woke, and found the Morning Sky.</l>
