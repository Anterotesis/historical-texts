            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRANSLATION, OF Abbé GIRARD's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF ſociety be formed, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of ideas and ſentiments, ſpeech, is, undoubtedly, its moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and moſt graceful band, being, at once, the pencil of the mind, the image of its operations, and, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the heart. The more, we go
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0199300801:6"/>abroad, among men, the more, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that language, is the true ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every delight. When all things elſe fail, or, when, through age, we have no other enjoyment, that of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will furniſh amuſement in our latter hours, and, will, at that time, grow more and more ſatisfactory; as it will, in ſome meaſure, make up for the want of thoſe pleaſures, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of receiving. In all times, and, on all occaſions, ſpeech is delightful: there can be no true happineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the joys of the mind; no good fortune, that we do not long to make known; no ſecret, we do not wiſh to communicate; no tender ſentiment, we are not anxious to declare; no ſyſtem, we do not thirſt to unfold; no evil, we are not eager to complain of; no comfort, without the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic breathings of friendſhip; no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, without the voice of renown;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0199300801:7"/>in a word, nothing, without the aid of language, at leaſt, nothing, which can ſatisfy our underſtandings, or, flatter our inclinations. Who then would be ſo indolent, as, to pay no attention to the graces, or, ſo wanting, as, to diſregard the power of one faculty, which gives luſtre to every other? Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite nation, can never entertain notions, injurious to true taſte. Good education extends her care, equally, to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a people, as, their morals: ſhe does not confine herſelf, to the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mind, inwardly, with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſcience, and, virtue; but, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, alſo, to grace it, outwardly, by teaching it the art of ſhewing itſelf to advantage. Her deſire is, that our expreſſions ſhould correſpond with our thoughts, and, that our reputation ſhould be anſwerable to our merit. Speech, then, deſerves our beſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we ought to think ourſelves
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0199300801:8"/>indebted to thoſe, who ſtudy its culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; whether by learned rules, drawn up according to its peculiar ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, to give a knowledge of it, with preciſion; or, by judicious criticiſms, in order, to preſerve its purity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rejecting the new advantages, of which, it is ſuſceptible; or, by ſuch uſeful acquiſitions, as may enrich it, without rendering it unintelligible. But how much ſhould we be obliged to that perſon, who could in any meaſure fix it, and, put a ſtop to thoſe many innovations which mere caprice, daily, ſtrives to introduce? This is a taſk, I fear, beyond the power of individuals: the deſtiny of whatever is living, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids its continuing, always, in the ſame ſtate. However, be the fate of our language, in after-ages, as it may; neither the fear of its alteration, nor, even, its annihilation, ſhall deter me from publiſhing the obſervations I have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0199300801:9"/>made. They have neither the rules of grammar, nor the purity of cuſtom, for their object, but the delicate differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, only, between words, reputed ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous; that is to ſay, the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing characteriſtics of ſuch words, as, reſembling each other, in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral idea, may, nevertheleſs, be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable, one from another, by ſome additional one, peculiar to each of them; from whence ariſes, on many occaſions, a neceſſity of choice, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to uſe them with propriety, and, elegance; a thing, as uncommon, as it is beautiful; and, by which taſte is enabled to give brilliancy to truth, and, ſolidity to wit. Avoiding all empty words, it teaches us to reaſon ſoundly; averſe to the abuſe of terms, it makes our diction intelligible; judicious in the choice of words, it gives eaſe and elegance to our expreſſions: with the greateſt accuracy, it baniſhes all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetched,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0199300801:10"/>vague and ſpiritleſs images, with which the trifling and ſuperficial, are content to expreſs themſelves; an enemy to confuſion, it prevents our rambling in the ſtudy of the ſciences; in ſhort, I will venture to affirm, that this ſpirit of juſtneſs and diſtinction, is the true ray that ſhines; and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, is the lively touch, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the man of delicacy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, from the vulgar and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>In order to acquire this juſtneſs, we muſt be a little nice upon words, not imagining, that ſuch, as are called ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous, are really ſo, exactly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in their ſenſe, and, reſemble each other, as perfectly, as two drops of water from the ſame ſpring: for, on a cloſer examination, we ſhall ſee, that this reſemblance, does not take in the whole extent and force of ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but conſiſts, only, in one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0199300801:11"/>idea, which, they all expreſs; each word differing from the other, by ſome relative one, which conſtitutes its proper and particular character. That reſemblance, which conveys one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral idea, makes, then, the words, ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous; and, the difference, that ariſes from the particular idea, that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the general, makes them, far from being perfectly alike, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as various ſhades of the ſame colour.</p>
            <p>I will not, abſolutely, ſay, that there are not occaſions, on which, ſo nice a choice may be diſpenſed with; but, I maintain, that there are ſtill more, where they ought not, or, cannot paſs one for another, eſpecially, in ſtudied and elaborate compoſitions. I will allow it to be a matter of indifference, in chooſing a yellow habit, whether we take the hue of the marigold or jonquil; but, would we make an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0199300801:12"/>agreeable variety, it is neceſſary to conſult the different ſhades or tints: how ſeldom, then, does it happen, that the mind, does not find itſelf, in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances? Very rare indeed! as in that conſiſts, the whole art of writing.</p>
            <p>Leſt any one, under a falſe notion, that the richneſs of a language conſiſts, in the plurality and abundance of words, ſhould explode this ſyſtem of mine, relative to the dictinction of thoſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſynonymous; I muſt ſay, that though language is enriched by an abundance of words, yet, that abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is not merely numeral; which is fit for nothing, but, as it were, to fill the coffers of a miſer; but, ſuch as ſprings from diverſity, like that, which is obſerved, in the various productions of nature. It is the ſatisfaction of the mind, and, not the tickling of the ear, which is the object of all converſation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0199300801:13"/>and writing; for which reaſon, the quantity of words, is not ſo much to be eſteemed, as their quality. If they vary, only, from each other in their ſounds, and, not in their greater or leſs degrees of energy, comprehenſion, preciſion, &amp;c. they, in my opinion, ſerve more to burthen the memory, than, enrich or facilitate the art of ſpeech. To ſtand up for a number of words, without any regard to their ſenſe, is, confounding abundance, with ſuperfluity; ſuch a taſte, I cannot better compare, than, to that, of the maſter of a feaſt, who ſhould think the magnificence of an entertainment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted more, in the number of diſhes, than, of eatables. Where is the great utility in having many terms to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs one ſingle idea? Is there not more advantage in having proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions for every idea we can form?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0199300801:14"/>It will be in vain for Pleonaſm, to alledge in its defence, that by this abundance, we avoid the bad effects of repetition; for, we are deceived with reſpect to the cauſe of that effect; it is not the repeating of the ſame ſound, that offends ſo much, as the repetition of the ſame idea. If the ſame word diſpleaſes, when uſed a ſecond time, it is not, becauſe it hath already ſtruck the ear; but, becauſe it hath, before, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the mind, which grows weary, and, is diſguſted, without the graces of novelty. Hence, came the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certain words, we call Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns; the repetition of which, cuſtom hath made familiar, having given them no other office, than, ſimply, to recall the matter in queſtion, without any redundancy of words. For the ſame reaſon, what we call Articles, and, Prepoſitions, are, equally, repeated without diſguſt; nothing being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0199300801:15"/>from them, but, a bare nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or indication; for having nothing to determine of themſelves, they, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, appear new, when the ſubject they indicate, is new. This is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proof that the beauty of words, is more owing to their variety of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than, to their different articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, that 'tis a multiplicity of ideas, that produces, in effect, a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of terms. If any one, yet, doubts this, he has nothing to do, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them a little cloſer, and, be a little nicer in his choice; or, without giving himſelf the trouble of ſuch exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, let him peruſe, only, with attention, the reflections here, laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; for, be the remarks, either juſt or not, they will, plainly, ſhew, that, there are no words, ſo perfectly, ſynonymous, as, to ſignify, exactly, the ſame, upon all occaſions; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they admit of a particular nicety
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0199300801:16"/>in choice. It is this choice, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſheets endeavour to determine, by definitions, and, examples, which diſtinguiſh, and, diſcloſe the proper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of theſe words; in which, it is hoped, they will, in ſome meaſure, ſucceed.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the work itſelf, it may be ſaid, without, either, vanity or affected modeſty, that, it is copied from no one; neither was there any one to copy; if it, therefore, merits nothing, from the manner of its execution; it will, at leaſt, from its novelty: to this may be added that of variety; for, almoſt, every page, contains ſomething differing from, and, independent of, that, which goes before, or, follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, although of the ſame ſort. Never book was, at the ſame time, more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and, more diverſiſied: its peruſal needs not be, either, continued or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; let the reader open it, where he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0199300801:17"/>will, he cannot fail of finding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and, that, entire; which will, at leaſt, ſatisfy his curioſity, if not content his underſtanding: it will ſerve as well, to amuſe a quarter of an hour, as, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a whole day; and, may be taken up, and, laid aſide, at any time.</p>

               <p>THE words <hi>abandon</hi> and <hi>leave</hi> imply involuntary acts; the words <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, relinquiſh</hi> and <hi>deſert,</hi> thoſe that are voluntary.</p>
               <p>To <hi>abandon,</hi> is more applicable to things; <hi>leave,</hi> to perſons. He was under a neceſſity of <hi>abandoning</hi> his poſſeſſions, and compelled to <hi>leave</hi> his friends.</p>
               <p>To <hi>forſake,</hi> implies leaving in reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſlike; to <hi>relinquiſh,</hi> quitting

               <p>Being treated with diſreſpect, we are apt to <hi>forſake</hi> even the perſon, whoſe cauſe we were ſtudious to eſpouſe. Every honeſt man, finding his plea not backed by juſtice, would readily <hi>relinquiſh</hi> his claim, and even make his competitor a recompence adequate to the expence and trouble he had put him to. It is an act of the greateſt baſeneſs to <hi>deſert</hi> one's friend in time of diſtreſs.</p>

               <p>To <hi>abdicate</hi> is an involuntary act; <hi>renounce</hi> and <hi>reſign</hi> are voluntary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abdicate</hi> more particularly relates to a throne; <hi>renounce,</hi> to matters of religion; <hi>reſign,</hi> to employments.</p>
               <p>King James the ſecond <hi>abdicated</hi> the throne of England, when he could keep poſſeſſion of it no longer. Many perſons, through conviction of mind, have formally <hi>renounced</hi> the errors of the church of Rome. We frequently <hi>reſign</hi> our employments, through a deſire of retirement.</p>
               <p>To <hi>abdicate</hi> a crown, is ever looked upon as diſgraceful; to <hi>renounce</hi> a religion, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, when done through the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of truth; and to <hi>reſign</hi> and office, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when generouſly given up in favour of another, and with the approbation of the perſon we ſerve.</p>

               <head>3. To <hi>Abale, Diminiſh,</hi> To <hi>Decreaſe, Leſſen.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Theſe words are nearly ſynonymous, when they are verbs neuter; they, then, mean to grow leſs: as verbs active, they are very different. Even as neuters, they will carry ſome difference in their meaning.</p>
               <p>To <hi>abate,</hi> implies a decreaſe in action; <hi>diminiſh,</hi> a waſte in ſubſtance; <hi>decreaſe,</hi> a decay in moral virtue; <hi>leſſen,</hi> a contraction of parts.</p>
               <p>Want of ſpirits, when a man is running, will <hi>abate</hi> his ardour, and, conſequently, his pace. Febrifuges, if properly applied, will <hi>abate</hi> a fever. Put ſugar into water, and it will <hi>diminiſh</hi> viſibly. An object, ſeemingly, <hi>diminiſhes,</hi> in proportion to the diſtance, from which, we view it.</p>
               <p>Through a contempt of religion, men, daily, <hi>decreaſe</hi> in virtue, a <hi>decreaſe</hi> in piety, is uſually accompanied with falſe notions of God. Draw the air from a blown-up blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and it <hi>leſſens,</hi> proportionably.</p>
               <p>As verbs active; to <hi>abate,</hi> more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, implies, to lower in the price of;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0199300801:27"/>
                  <hi>diminiſh,</hi> to make leſs by abſciſion or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, either with reſpect to bulk, value, quality or quantity; <hi>leſſen,</hi> to a voluntary act of degradation.</p>
               <p>Shop-keepers, generally, aſk their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers an advanced price for goods, that they may be enabled to <hi>abate,</hi> if deſired.</p>
               <p>By dividing of ſubſtance, we <hi>diminiſh</hi> its bulk; by breaking a diamond, we <hi>diminiſh</hi> its value; by mixing water with ſpirits, we <hi>diminiſh</hi> the quality; and by taking one yard from ten, we <hi>diminiſh</hi> the quantity.</p>
               <p>A mean action always <hi>leſſens</hi> us, in the ſight of good men; and whatever falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vanity may inculcate, we ever ſeem <hi>leſs,</hi> when we ſtrive to appear greater.</p>

               <p>All theſe words imply averſion, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be differently uſed, upon different occaſions.</p>
               <p>To <hi>abhor,</hi> implys an averſion to that, to which, we have a natural antipathy; <hi>hate,</hi> an averſion actuated by revenge: <hi>loath,</hi> is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0199300801:28"/>more applicable to food: <hi>deteſt,</hi> implies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion actuated by diſapprobation.</p>
               <p>We <hi>abhor,</hi> what we cannot endure. We are apt to <hi>hate</hi> the perſon, who injures us. We <hi>loath</hi> the food, by which we have been ſurfeited. We <hi>deteſt</hi> the man, who is guilty of a mean action.</p>
               <p>The ſpendthrift, naturally, <hi>abhors</hi> nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlineſs, and the niggard, profligacy. The <hi>hatred</hi> of the revengeful man, is rouſed, whenever the object of his revenge approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

               <p>As the words <hi>abject</hi> and <hi>low</hi> are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately uſed, when meant to ſignify a perſon's ſtate or condition; ſo are the words <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>beggarly,</hi> when we would expreſs the diſpoſition: but the impropriety of ſo doing, is very evident.</p>
               <p>By <hi>abject,</hi> is underſtood that forlorn ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0199300801:29"/>in life, that a man brings himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by ill conduct; by <hi>low,</hi> that, in which Providence has placed him: the firſt, is voluntary; the latter, involuntary.</p>
               <p>Divine Wiſdom hath thought proper, for various reaſons, to make diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men, placing ſome, in a higher ſphere, others, in a <hi>lower;</hi> but never was he the cauſe of any one's <hi>abjectneſs.</hi> Want of merit or fortune, often, renders a man <hi>low;</hi> but it muſt be a villainous character, to make him <hi>abject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to the words <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly,</hi> when meant to expreſs the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the abſurdity of uſing them, one for the other, is, equally, viſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mean,</hi> ſignifies a man's readineſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a dirty or illicit action; whereas <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly,</hi> is, more particularly, expreſſive of a narrow, groveling ſpirit.</p>
               <p>He who can ſtoop, to be guilty of a <hi>meanneſs,</hi> merits the contempt of all who know him. It has, ever, been accounted <hi>beggarly,</hi> to live below the rank of life we are in.</p>
               <p>When a man is brought into a ſtate of penury and contempt, by a long courſe of infamy, we, juſtly, call him <hi>abject;</hi> if his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0199300801:30"/>narrow circumſtances are, only, owing to the poverty of his parents, we, then, repute him <hi>low;</hi> when guilty of any thing, beneath the character of an honeſt man, or a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, we account him <hi>mean;</hi> and when the treaſures of the rich, are ſullied by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row notions of the poor, we call it <hi>beggarly.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Aboliſh,</hi> is a term, rather to be uſed with reſpect to cuſtoms; <hi>abrogate</hi> and <hi>repeal,</hi> with regard to laws; <hi>diſannul</hi> and <hi>revoke,</hi> to private contracts.</p>
               <p>When old cuſtoms have been, by long experience, found to be detrimental, they have, very prudently, been <hi>aboliſhed.</hi> New faſhions, <hi>aboliſh</hi> old ones.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>abrogate,</hi> is generally uſed with reſpect to ancient laws; <hi>repeal,</hi> to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern: that is, when we talk of rendering old laws null, we call it <hi>abrogating;</hi> when thoſe lately made, <hi>repealing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deſpotic power has frequently <hi>abrogated</hi> what was inſtituted by equity. Upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0199300801:31"/>enaction of a new law, many inconveniences have ſometimes appeared, before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of; this, has occaſioned a <hi>repeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>abrogation</hi> of a fundamental law, frequently cauſes the ruin of the ſovereign, or of the people; and, ſometimes, of both. The legiſlative power has often found itſelf obliged to <hi>repeal</hi> an act of parliament one ſeſſions, which paſſed the laſt; merely, to appeaſe the clamours of the people.</p>
               <p>The difference in meaning, between the words <hi>diſannul</hi> and <hi>revoke,</hi> is not very great; yet ſuch, as to admit of a diſtinction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſannul</hi> is applied to a written contract; <hi>revoke</hi> to a verbal.</p>
               <p>He, who gives a conditional bond to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has a right to <hi>diſannul</hi> it, if the ſpecified conditions are not punctually obſerved.

               </head>
               <p>With reſpect to the three firſt words, the proper idea of <hi>finiſhing,</hi> is, the bringing a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0199300801:32"/>thing to its laſt period: the <hi>completion</hi> of any thing, is, the actual arrival of that laſt period: and the characteriſtic of <hi>ending,</hi> is ceſſation or diſcontinuation.</p>
               <p>Lazy people begin many things, without <hi>finiſhing</hi> any.

               <p>By the word <hi>conclude,</hi> we underſtand, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the laſt act of ratiocination; widely differing from <hi>complete.</hi> We <hi>complete</hi> a piece of mechaniſm; but <hi>conclude</hi> an oration.</p>

               <p>The abſurdity of a contrary diction, is evident from the following change of words: it was his honour, <hi>upon</hi> which, he ſwore.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the word <hi>upon</hi> is uſed with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, even detached from ſubſtance, when the ſenſe is figurative; as for inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he relied <hi>upon</hi> the promiſe of his friend; intimating, that, that promiſe, was the ſtaff, <hi>upon</hi> which, he leaned: but, on other occaſions, the impropriety is groſs.</p>

               <p>An elegant ſpeaker, will not ſay, a <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act,</hi> a <hi>good or a vitious act;</hi> but an <hi>act of virtue,</hi> or <hi>of goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>of iniquity:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, to ſay, a <hi>virtuous action,</hi> or <hi>a good</hi> or <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious action,</hi> is proper and elegant.</p>
               <p>'Tis, generally ſpeaking, a good <hi>action</hi> to conceal the faults of our neighbours; and it is the rareſt <hi>act</hi> of charity, among mankind.</p>
               <p>The ſentiments of the heart, are not, ſo much, to be judged of, from words, as from <hi>actions.</hi> It is an <hi>act,</hi> of great heroiſm,

The word <hi>action,</hi> in this light, relates, more, to the power that acts; and the word <hi>act,</hi> is, more, applicable to the effect itſelf, produced by that power; this makes the one, properly, the attribute of the other: ſo, that it may be, juſtly, ſaid, we ſhould always have a preſence of mind, attendant upon our <hi>actions,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, all of them, either <hi>acts</hi> of bounty, or <hi>acts</hi> of juſtice.</p>

               <p>When we give our opinion, on being ſeriouſly aſked, we are ſaid, to <hi>declare</hi> it: when we would give that declaration, more force, we <hi>affirm</hi> it: and, to ſtrengthen that affirmation, we <hi>proteſt</hi> it, ſolemnly; that is we <hi>affirm</hi> it, by invoking the Deity.</p>
               <l>The other words, are, ſufficiently, explained above.</l>

               <p>The words <hi>avouch,</hi> and <hi>atteſt,</hi> tho' often uſedas ſynonynous, with the foregoing; have a very different ſignification. The word, <hi>avouch,</hi> implies, an aſſertion, in defence of another; <hi>atteſt,</hi> a bearing, witneſs to what another has, juſt before, ſaid.</p>
               <p>When the reputation of an honeſt man has been, undeſervedly, hurt, 'tis the part of a friend, to <hi>avouch</hi> his good character.</p>

               <p>Ladies, always, owe their <hi>attractions</hi> and their <hi>charms,</hi> to a happy formation of their features and perſons; but they, ſometimes, procure their <hi>allurements,</hi> at their toilettes.</p>
               <p>I know not whether I may fall in with the taſte of mankind; but in my opinion, <hi>attractions</hi> riſe from thoſe ordinary graces, which nature has beſtowed upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with more or leſs liberality, and which are the common appendages of the ſex; <hi>allurements,</hi> from thoſe cultivated graces, which form a faithful mirrour of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and are ſtudied, merely, with a deſire to pleaſe; <hi>charms,</hi> from thoſe ſingular graces, which nature, ſometimes, beſtows as a moſt valuable gift, and which are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and perſonal.</p>
               <p>Defects not ſeen at firſt, but afterwards obſerved, leſſen <hi>attractions</hi> greatly. <hi>Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> vaniſh, as ſoon as the artifice appears. <hi>Charms</hi> loſe their force, when time and cuſtom hath rendered them familiar.</p>
               <p>Theſe words are not in uſe only, with regard to beauty, and the graces of the ſex; but, with reſpect to every thing that pleaſes. In this caſe, <hi>attractions</hi> and <hi>charms,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0199300801:50"/>are applied, only, to ſuch things, as are amiable in themſelves; whereas, the word <hi>allurements,</hi> is, ſometimes, applied to ſuch things, as are even in themſelves odious; but, which we love nevertheleſs.</p>
               <p>Virtue has <hi>attractions,</hi> which the moſt vicious of men cannot avoid being ſenſible of. The riches of the world are <hi>allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which never fail to captivate, in ſpite of their ill tendency. Pleaſure has ſuch <hi>charms,</hi> that it is hunted after by every one, as well by the philoſopher, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine.</p>

               <p>By <hi>good-nature,</hi> is meant, that diſpoſition, which partakes the felicity of all mankind; that promotes the ſatisfaction of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, within the reach of its ability; that relieves the diſtreſſed, comforts the afflicted, diffuſes bleſſings, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates happineſs, as far as its ſphere of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can extend; whereas, <hi>good-humour</hi> is nothing more, than a chearful, pleaſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, ariſing, either from a natural gaiety of mind, or, an affectation of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, joined to an affability of behaviour, which is the reſult of good-breeding, and a compliance with the taſte of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.—This kind of <hi>good-humour,</hi> is by far, the moſt ſtriking quality; 'tis frequently miſtaken for, and complimented with, the ſuperior name of real <hi>good-nature.</hi> A man, by this ſpecious appearance, has often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that appellation, who, in all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his private life, has been a moroſe,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0199300801:64"/>cruel, revengeful, ſullen, haughty tyrant. On the contrary, a man of a true benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, and formed, to promote the happineſs of all around him, may ſometimes, perhaps, from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable openneſs of heart, above the meanneſs of diſguiſe, be guilty of little ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of peeviſhneſs or <hi>ill-humour,</hi> that may carry the appearance of, and be, unjuſtly, thought to proceed from, <hi>ill-nature,</hi> by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are not acquainted with his true character; and, who take them for ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous terms, tho', in reality, they have not the leaſt analogy to each other.</p>

                  <hi>Be,</hi> agrees with all ſorts of ſubjects, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or modes; with all manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, real or ideal: <hi>Exiſt,</hi> is uſed, only, with reſpect to ſubſtances, and thoſe, real: <hi>Subſiſt,</hi> is applied, equally, to ſubſtances or modes, but with reference to the duration of their being, which is not expreſſed by the other two words.</p>
               <p>We ſay, of qualities, forms, actions, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, of all their different relations, that, they <hi>are;</hi> we ſay, of matter, ſpirit,

               <p>The verb, <hi>be,</hi> is commonly, uſed to mark the event of any modification or quality, in the ſubject: that, of <hi>exiſt,</hi> is in uſe, only, to expreſs the end of ſimple exiſtence: and we employ <hi>ſubſiſt,</hi> to point out the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that exiſtence or modification.

               <p>The maid of Orleans, cried down by the Engliſh, but, eſteemed by the French, was, equally, <hi>famous,</hi> in both nations.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0199300801:98"/>an impoſſibility.

               <p>Theſe three ways of ſpeaking, are, upon occaſion, ingenious methods of concealing one's true meaning: but we make uſe of an <hi>equivocation,</hi> to deceive; of an <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity,</hi> to keep in the dark, from all; and of a <hi>double-entendre,</hi> to conceal, from ſome.</p>

               <p>The purity of language, depends upon its <hi>words;</hi> the preciſion, upon its <hi>terms;</hi> and brilliancy, upon its <hi>expreſſions.</hi>
               </p>

We are <hi>fatigued</hi> with work.</p>
               <p>When we are <hi>weary</hi> of a thing, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete it, we lack ſpirits; when, <hi>tired,</hi> we are, totally, unable; when <hi>fatigued,</hi> we want ſtrength to go through it, as we would.</p>

                  <hi>Wearineſs,</hi> proceeds, ſometimes, from an unwillingneſs, in what we undertake; we are, frequently, <hi>tired,</hi> through diſpoſition of body, and ſlow circulation of blood; but, <hi>fatigue,</hi> is, always, the conſequence of much action; it ſuppoſes exceſs of work, with reſpect, either to difficulty or length of time.</p>
               <p>In a figurative ſenſe, a petitioner grows <hi>weary,</hi> through his impatience; <hi>tired,</hi> thro' his perſeverance; and <hi>fatigued,</hi> through his importunities.</p>

               <p>An impatient agitation, or, riſing of the blood, againſt any one, who has offended us, is the common import of the two firſt, of theſe terms: The word, <hi>angry,</hi> implies, a paſſion more internal and laſting; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the expreſſion, <hi>in a paſſion,</hi> carries in its idea, a ſudden, external guſt of anger; ſhort, but violent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anger,</hi> ſhall, ſometimes, brood in the breaſt, for years; till at laſt it becomes, as it were, fixed and ſettled; ſometimes, it will diſſemble, for a long while together; but, often, finds it extremely difficult to pardon: On the contrary, it is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral characteriſtic of thoſe, who are <hi>in a paſſion,</hi> to forgive, as ſoon as it ſubſides; which may, perhaps, be the next quarter of an hour; beſides, the man, <hi>in a paſſion,</hi> cannot diſſemble; his violence of <hi>anger,</hi> muſt have vent; when that's obtained, he is as cool as before: indeed, his <hi>paſſion,</hi> will now and then, ſettle into confirmed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0199300801:154"/>
                  <hi>anger,</hi> but when that is the caſe, it is, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, owing to repeated offences.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the word, <hi>paſſionate,</hi> there is a wide difference, between the man <hi>in a paſſion,</hi> and the <hi>paſſionate</hi> man; the one, being extraordinary, the other, ordinary.</p>
               <p>Few men, for example, can avoid being <hi>in a paſſion,</hi> when, they are, greatly, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; but <hi>paſſionate</hi> people, are heated, on the moſt trifling occaſions.</p>

               <p>The true meaning of the word, <hi>hump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backed,</hi> is, having a riſing, upon the back, owing either to <hi>crookedneſs,</hi> or ſome other cauſe, and may be either natural or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental: tho' the words, <hi>crooked</hi> and <hi>deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> convey other ideas, ſtill nothing is more common, than to find them, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, in uſe to expreſs the ſame as <hi>hump-backed.</hi> By <hi>crookedneſs,</hi> is underſtood, any deviation from natural ſtraitneſs. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> implies, any part of the body being imperfect or unnatural. Thus, a man is <hi>crooked,</hi> if any ways, twiſted or bent from the natural ſhape; and <hi>deformed,</hi> if he has an eye, a finger, or, a toe, too little, or, too much. We may be <hi>hump-backed,</hi> or, <hi>crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> by a fall, or, ſome other accident; but <hi>deformed,</hi> we cannot be, otherwiſe, than by a defect or exuberance in nature.</p>

               <p>Taking theſe words in the ſenſe, of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power over the minds of others; <hi>weight,</hi> implies, prevalence, tho' ſmall; <hi>influence,</hi> ſeems to have more force; <hi>ſway,</hi> is more abſolute.</p>
               <p>Superiority of rank and reaſon, gives <hi>weight;</hi> it is commonly by perſuaſion, that it acts. Attachment to perſons contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to the <hi>influence,</hi> they have over us; it is by ſollicitation, it prevails. The art of finding out and taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the weakneſs of men, forms the <hi>ſway,</hi> we bear over them; 'tis by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their motion, that we ſucceed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>weight</hi> we have with others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, always, from ſome worth, in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either of mind, birth or fortune. <hi>Influence</hi> is owing to ſome tye, either of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0199300801:172"/>heart or intereſt. <hi>Sway,</hi> riſes from an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency, arrogated by art, or, ceded to us, thro' weakneſs.</p>
               <p>A perſon of <hi>weight,</hi> has ſucceeded, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when arguments would have no force. <hi>Influence,</hi> on ſome occaſions, hath wrought, almoſt, miracles, effecting that, which money could not bring to bear. <hi>Sway,</hi> is a wonderful operator on weak minds: procuring that, through art, which no other thing can, poſſibly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>What perverſeneſs then, can poſſibly withſtand a man of ſome <hi>weight</hi> in himſelf; whoſe <hi>influence</hi> is great, and, who knows how to bear a proper <hi>ſway.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>We find in the word, <hi>authority,</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent energy to make us perceive a right, either of civil or politic adminiſtration. There is in the word, <hi>power,</hi> a particular relation to the ſubordinate execution of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0199300801:173"/>ſuperior orders. The word, <hi>dominion,</hi> carries with it, an idea of empire.</p>
               <p>It is the law, which gives <hi>authority;</hi> it deriving all its might, from thence. <hi>Power,</hi> is inveſted in delegates, thoſe, to whom the execution of the laws is entruſted, and is, conſequently, in ſubordination to <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Dominion,</hi> ſprings from the joint conſent of the people, or, from the force of arms, and, is either lawful or tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</p>
               <p>We are happy, in living under the <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of a Prince, who prides himſelf in juſtice; whoſe miniſters aſſume no <hi>power,</hi> beyond what is legal; and, who makes the welfare of his ſubjects, the baſis of his <hi>dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Authority,</hi> if weak, is expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; it is, equally, as dangerous, not to make uſe of it on proper occaſions, as, even, to abuſe it. A blind <hi>power,</hi> which acts in oppoſition to juſtice, becomes odious, and paves the way to its own ruin. A jealous <hi>dominion,</hi> that admits of no ſharer, makes itſelf formidable; awakens, on that ao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the ardor of its enemies, and, thus, uſhers in its own fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0199300801:174"/>There appears to me, particularly, in the idea of <hi>authority,</hi> ſomething juſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable; in the idea of <hi>power,</hi> ſomething ſtrong and active; and, in the idea of <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion,</hi> ſomething great and elevated.</p>
               <p>As there is none but God, that has an unlimited <hi>authority;</hi> ſo, there is none elſe, who has infinite <hi>power;</hi> neither is there any abſolute, ſovereign, and independent <hi>domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> than his.</p>
               <p>Nature has eſtabliſhed no <hi>authority</hi> among men, but that of fathers, over their children; all other, proceeds from poſitive right. The <hi>power</hi> of the paſſions, is the true ſpring of action, and, determines us, with reſpect, either to good or evil. It is not only by the diſpoſition of human laws, that marriage places the woman under the <hi>dominion</hi> of the man; but, it is, alſo, ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by the divine.</p>

               <p>We are apt to uſe theſe words indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, one as well as the other, to expreſs a great degree of any thing.

               <p>In the figurative ſenſe, the difference of theſe words, is ſo extremely great, as to need no pointing out; in the literal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they are, often, confounded; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered then, in this laſt ſenſe, <hi>heavineſs,</hi> is that quality in a body, which we feel, and, diſtinguiſh by itſelf: <hi>weight,</hi> is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of that quality, which we cannot aſcertain, but, by compariſon.</p>
               <p>We ſay, abſolutely, and, in an undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſenſe, that a thing is <hi>heavy;</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, and, in a manner determined, that, it is of ſuch a <hi>weight,</hi> for example, of two, three, or, four pounds.</p>
               <p>A thouſand circumſtances, prove the <hi>heavineſs</hi> of the air; and, the mercury, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines its exact <hi>weight.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>We are ſaid, to <hi>return,</hi> what has been lent or given us: to <hi>ſurrender,</hi> what we have in pledge or charge: to <hi>reſtore,</hi> what we have taken or ſtolen.</p>
               <p>We ought to <hi>return,</hi> punctually; to <hi>ſurrender,</hi> faithfully; and, to <hi>reſtore,</hi> wholly.</p>
               <p>We borrow, with an intent to <hi>return;</hi> we take a thing in charge, with a view of <hi>ſurrendering</hi> it again; but, we ſeldom take, with a deſign to <hi>reſtore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cuſtom makes uſe of theſe words, on the following occaſions; the firſt, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to civility, favours, preſents, or, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of kindneſs: the ſecond, with reſpect to what, we are entruſted with; honours, employs, or, offices, with which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted: the third, with relation to things taken away, that have been our due. Thus, we <hi>return</hi> money, that has been lent us; preſents, we have received; and, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to a deſerted ſweet-heart: we <hi>ſurrender</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0199300801:236"/>a child, to its parents; the ribbon of an order, the ſtaff of command, ſeals, and, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to a prince; we <hi>reſtore,</hi> an accuſed perſon, when found innocent, to his eſtates and honours; and, a minor, to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his effects, which have been held from him.</p>

                  <hi>Sincerity,</hi> prevents our ſpeaking, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than we think; and, is a virtue. <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> makes us ſpeak, as we think; and, is a natural effect. <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> is, ſpeaking, freely, what we think; and, ſprings, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, from want of reflection. <hi>Ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> makes us declare what we know; and, is, often, a folly.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſincere</hi> man, will not deceive; a <hi>frank</hi> man, will not diſſemble; a <hi>plain</hi> man, is not apt to flatter; an <hi>ingenuous</hi> man, knows not how to conceal any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sincerity,</hi> is of great value, in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the heart. <hi>Frankneſs,</hi> facilitates
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0199300801:237"/>the commerce of the world. <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> is, often, conſidered, as a want of politeneſs. <hi>Ingenuouſneſs,</hi> is, frequently, found to err, againſt prudence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſincere,</hi> are, always, eſteemed. The <hi>frank,</hi> pleaſe all the world. The <hi>plain,</hi> ſometimes, offend. The <hi>ingenuous,</hi> often, betray themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Experiment,</hi> relates, properly, to the truth of things; it determines, whether a thing is, or, is not; clearing up of doubt, and, diſſipating ignorance. <hi>Trial,</hi> concerns, particularly, the uſe of things; judging, whether they are proper, or, not; it ſettles the matter, and, determines the will. <hi>Proof,</hi> has a greater relation to the quality of things; teaching us, whether they are good, or, bad, diſtinguiſhing the beſt, and, taking away any fear of being deceived.</p>
