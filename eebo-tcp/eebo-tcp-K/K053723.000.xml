            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Opera was written upon the ſpur of the occaſion; a circumſtance which may palliate, though not excuſe its faults. The ſubject of the fable remains as in the original; but a few alterations have been made in its conſtruction; and the writer has attempted to heighten the characters by a colouring of humour.</p>
            <p>FEW pieces have experienced a more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſecution. Previous to its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the Manager and Writer were peſtered with anonymous letters, threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its deſtruction, by the force of party, for their daring to attempt an emulous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Romance under the ſame title then preparing at <hi>Drury Lane:</hi> and, after it appeared, ſeveral of the prints teemed with ſevere animadverſions and abuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0055202300:6"/>ONE critic diſplayed his judgment with great ingenuity and candour: he opened his old ſchool ſatchell, and quoted both Greek and Latin, to point out paſſages analogous to claſſic ideas; every literal error of the preſs was produced and animadverted on with aſtoniſhing ability; he found proſaic lines in the poetry, and poetic thoughts in the proſe; but, above all, he made this great diſcovery, that the ſentiments of <hi>loyalty</hi> breathed through the dialogue, were inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the Britiſh conſtitution.</p>
            <p>As men of ſenſibility <hi>feel</hi> when their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity is brought forward, this critic ſhall not be put to the bluſh, but be permitted to indulge in the ſecret ſatisfaction ariſing from his friendly exertions.</p>

                  <p>I was taught to live upon nothing by loſing every thing—The leeches of Paris ſucked up my patrimony; its pleaſures I found pains; its ſweets, bitters.
