            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>And Wealth engag'd my wandering view;</l>
                  <l>And Pleaſure wooed me to her arms:</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>To each by turns my vows I paid,</l>

            <l>Thy lovely mother's gentle mind inherit,</l>
            <l>Thy father's honeſt heart, and generous ſpirit—</l>
            <l>Yes, Yes, I ſee (ſo ſtrong prophetic power!)</l>
            <l>An embryo genius in this riſing flower,</l>
            <l>A hand that's valiant, and a heart that's true</l>
            <l>To ſerve his neighbours, and his nation too:</l>
            <l>Thus in the acorn's little folds we ſee</l>
            <l>An oak imperial in epitome;</l>
            <l>By ſlow degrees the leaves, the boughs expand,</l>
            <l>Riſe, ſpread, ſhade, flouriſh, and defend the land.</l>

            <l>LET fools religion in opinion place,</l>
            <l>And call whim, ſpleen, and ſuperſtition, grace;</l>
            <l>Put in mock'd Virtue's legal hand a reed,</l>
            <l>And on her throne, vile idol! rear a creed,</l>
            <l>While weeping Charity is doom'd to ſeel</l>
            <l>The ſmarting ſcourge of unrelenting Zeal;</l>
            <l>And ſainted Bigotry, with impious pride,</l>
            <l>Claims all the ſky, and damns the world beſide.</l>
            <l>O! taught of heaven! be thine the better part,</l>
            <l>With ſacred love to touch the kindling heart;</l>
            <l>Still mild benevolence, like Jeſus preach,</l>
            <l>And ſpread the truths he liv'd and died to teach;</l>
            <l>Still build ſalvation on the Saviour's plan,</l>
            <l>And God's own glory on good-will to man;</l>
            <l>So ſhall good-nature at thy voice refine,</l>
            <l>And what was moral ſhall be more—divine!</l>
            <l>Self-love ſhall learn to taſte of ſocial joy,</l>
            <l>And public works the miſer's hands employ;</l>
            <l>Folly inform'd, converted Vice ſhall own,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>THE ſolemn hand of ſable ſuited night</l>
               <l>Enwraps the ſilent earth with mantle drear,</l>
               <l>Thick murky clouds obſcure Diana's light,</l>
               <l>Nor ſhines one ſtar the duſky ſcene to cheer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O'er the ſad manſion, hid in awful gloom,</l>
               <l>The Aethiop darkneſs ſpreads her ebon ſway,</l>
               <l>Save that alone, from yonder ſtudious room,</l>
               <l>The waſting taper ſheds a feeble ray.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now while the tenants of this ſacred dome</l>
               <l>Turn the grave page, or ſink to ſoft repoſe,</l>
               <l>Along the Gothic cloiſters let me roam,</l>
               <l>And, deep in thought, the lazy moments loſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now breathes the whiſtling ſtorm a mournful ſong,</l>

               <l>Whilſt Echo roves the lonely vaults among,</l>
               <l>Sadly-reſponſive to the midnight bell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And hark! the penſive owl, with boding ſtrain,</l>
               <l>Shrieks notes of terror from the learned grove;</l>
               <l>All! horrid ſounds! full well ye ſooth my pain,</l>

               <l>But pour in ceaſeleſs groans my love-ſick ſoul,</l>
               <l>'Till fades the lamp at bright Aurora's ray.</l>

               <l>How, at the fragrant hour of riſing morn,</l>

            <head>ON THE FOLLY OF ATHEISM.</head>
            <l>HOW weak the Atheiſt's argument, how odd?</l>
            <l>Who, to be happy, firſt denies a God;</l>
            <l>Then, with too little faith truth to believe,</l>
            <l>Can ſhow too much, an error to conceive;</l>
            <l>So inconſiſtent, and his folly ſuch,</l>
            <l>He truſts too little, while he truſts too much.</l>
            <l>A foe profeſs'd to God Almighty's laws,</l>
            <l>Yet a blind bigot in the Devil's cauſe;</l>
            <l>He from free-thinking hopes to gain ſome light;</l>
            <l>Thinks free on every ſubject, but the right;</l>
            <l>A hint there is a God raiſes a doubt,</l>
            <l>And Prejudice puts weaker Reaſon out:</l>
            <l>Of Reaſon proud, by Paſſion rul'd alone,</l>
            <l>Becauſe he'd have no God, concludes there's none;</l>
            <l>Thinks chance with blind effect nice order brings,</l>
            <l>And harmony from wild confuſion ſprings,</l>
            <l>Springs of itſelf—for all ſpontaneous grow,</l>
            <l>And the created are creators too:</l>
            <l>Then immortality he'll diſbelieve,</l>
            <l>Yet ſtarts to think he cannot always live;</l>
            <l>Dreading it true, a future ſtate denies,</l>
            <l>And while he laughs at death, with fear he dies;</l>
            <l>Deſpairing launches to ſome future ſtate,</l>
            <l>Repents his folly—but repents too late.</l>
