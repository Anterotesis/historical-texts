            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF <hi>Samuel Richardſon,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Printer; With regard to the INVASION of his PROPERTY IN The Hiſtory of Sir Charles Grandiſon, Before PUBLICATION, By certain BOOKSELLERS in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE EDITOR of The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON had intended to ſend the Volumes of it, as he did thoſe of the HISTORY of CLARISSA HARLOWE, to be printed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before he publiſhed them himſelf in <hi>London.</hi> Accordingly, when he had printed off ſo conſiderable a Part of the Work, as would have conſtantly employed the Preſs to which he purpoſed to conſign them, he ſent over 12 Sheets of the Firſt Volume to Mr. <hi>George Faulkner;</hi> intending to follow it with the reſt, as Opportunity offered.</p>
            <p>He had heard an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bookſeller boaſt, ſome Years ago, That he could procure from any Printing-Office in <hi>London,</hi> Sheets of any Book printing in it, while it was going on, and before Publication; and Mr. <hi>Faulkner</hi> cautioning him on this Subject, with regard to this Work, he took particular Care to prevent, as he hoped, the Effects of ſuch an infamous Corruption, as it muſt be called; ſince it could not be done but by bribing the Journeymen or Servants of the <hi>London</hi> Printer. He gave a ſtrict Charge, before he put the Piece to Preſs, to all his Workmen and Servants, as well in PRINT (that it might the ſtronger impreſs them), as by Word of Mouth, to be on their Guard againſt any out-door Attacks. This was the Subſtance of the printed Caution which he gave to his Workmen, on this Occaſion: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A Bookſeller of <hi>Dublin</hi> has aſſured me, That he could get the Sheets of any Book from any Printing-houſe in <hi>London,</hi> before Publication. I hope I may depend upon the Care and Circumſpection of my Friends, Compoſitors and Preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that no Sheets of the Piece I am now putting to Preſs be carried out of the Houſe; nor any Notice taken of its being at Preſs. It is of great Conſequence to me. Let no Stranger be admitted into any of the Work-rooms. Once more, I hope I may rely on the Integrity and Care of all my Workmen—And let all the Proofs, Reviſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be given to Mr. <hi>Tewley</hi>" [his Foreman], "to take care of."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He had no Reaſon to diſtruſt their Aſſurances; moſt of them being Perſons of experienced Honeſty; and was pleaſed with their declared Abhorrence of ſo vile a Treachery, and of all thoſe who ſhould attempt to corrupt them. Yet, to be ſtill more ſecure, as he thought, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Sheets, as they were printed off, to be depoſited in a <hi>ſeparate</hi> Warehouſe; the Care of which was entruſted to One, on whom he had laid ſuch Obligations, as, if he is guilty, has
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0061902300:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made his Perfidy a Crime of the blackeſt Nature<note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Biſhop,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs was to read Proofs to the Corrector, and to employ his Leiſure Hours in the Warehouſes; and who (and no other Perſon) being entruſted with the Sheets of Sir <hi>Charles Grandiſon,</hi> as wrought off; and to lay-by Three Sheets of each of the Twelves Edition, and One of the Octavo, for Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi>'s ſole Uſe; had an Opportunity which no other Man, however inclined, could have, to perpetrate this Baſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> on Suſpicions too well-grounded, diſmiſſed <hi>Biſhop</hi> from his Service; and, after he was gone, having Reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Thomas Killingbeck,</hi> one of his Compoſitors, as the Confederate of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and by whoſe means, he having worked ſome Years in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was eaſy for him to manage this Piece of Treachery; and <hi>Killingbeck,</hi> on Examination, giving him Cauſe to ſtrengthen his Suſpicions; yet aſſerting his Innocence; he propoſed to him the ſaid <hi>Killingbeck</hi> to draw up <hi>himſelf</hi> ſuch an Affidavit as he thought he could ſafely take, to exculpate himſelf. <hi>Killingbeck</hi> made poor Excuſes and Pretences; but, at laſt, took till the next Morning to draw it up. The next Morning he told Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> that he was adviſed not to draw up ſuch an Affidavit; and gave ſuch evaſive Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as induced every body to believe him guilty. Upon this, Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> diſcharged him from his Service. He left his Houſe, pretending he would draw up ſomething, as deſired; but never ſince came near it; and is now applying for Work elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Since writing the above, Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> has received a Letter from <hi>Biſhop,</hi> on Occaſion of ſome Friend of his adviſing him to an ample Confeſſion; and to depend on that forgiving Temper which he had before experienced; in which he offers Circumſtances to prove that <hi>Killingbeck</hi> might find Opportunities to ſteal the Sheets without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance; tho', were <hi>that</hi> the Caſe, none (after ſuch repeated Warnings and Cautions) to clear himſelf of the moſt culpable Negligence.</p>
               </note>. Having Three Printing-houſes, he had them compoſed, and wrought, by different Workmen, and at his different Houſes; and took ſuch other Precautions, that the Perſon to whoſe Truſt he committed them, being frequently queſtioned by him as to the Safety of the Work from Pirates, <hi>as</hi> frequently aſſured him, That it was impoſſible the Copy of any complete Volume could be come at, were there Perſons in his Houſe capable of being corrupted to attempt ſo vile a Robbery.</p>
            <p>What then muſt be his Surprize, when Intelligence was ſent him from <hi>Dublin,</hi> That Copies of a conſiderable Part of his Work had been obtained by Three different Perſons in that City; and that the Sheets were actually in the Preſs? The <hi>honeſt</hi> Men publiſhed their own Names, in Three different Title-Pages ſtuck up, in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the following Words:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Dublin, Aug.</hi> 4. 1753. <hi>Speedily will be publiſhed,</hi> The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON. In a Series of Letters Publiſhed from the Originals, By the EDITOR of PAMELA and CLARISSA. In Seven Volumes. <hi>Dublin:</hi> Printed by and for HENRY SAUNDERS, at the Corner of <hi>Chriſt-Church-Lane.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Second:—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Aug.</hi> 4th, 1753. In the Preſs, The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON" (as in the other). "<hi>Dublin:</hi> Printed by JOHN EXSHAW, on <hi>Cork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</hi>"</q> 
            </p>
            <p>The Third:—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Dublin, Aug.</hi> 4th, 1753. <hi>In the Preſs, and ſpeedily will be publiſhed,</hi> The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON" (as in the Two others). "<hi>London:</hi> Printed for <hi>S. Richardſon:</hi>" [Vile Artifice!] "<hi>Dublin:</hi> Reprinted for PETER WILSON, in <hi>Dame-ſtreet.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Editor had <hi>convincing</hi> Proofs given him, that one of theſe Men had procured a Copy of a conſiderable Part of the Work in <hi>Octavo;</hi> another in <hi>Duodecimo;</hi> and that they were proceeding to print it at ſeveral Preſſes.</p>
            <p>Terms having been agreed upon between Mr. <hi>Faulkner</hi> and the Editor, in Conſideration of the Preference to be given him (One of which related to the Time of publiſhing the <hi>Dublin</hi> Edition, that it might not interfere with the Appearance of the <hi>London</hi> one) Mr. <hi>Faulkner,</hi> in conſequence of the ſucceſsful Corruption, ſignified to the Editor, that it was needleſs to ſend him any more than the 12 Sheets he <hi>had</hi> ſent him; and that he had obtained a Fourth Share of theſe <hi>honourable</hi> Confederates: But that (to procure this Grace, as is ſuppoſed) he had been <hi>compelled,</hi> as he calls it, to deliver up to them, to print by, the Copy of the 12 Sheets aforeſaid, which had ſome few Corrections in them, which occurred on a laſt Reviſal; but which are of no Moment with regard to the Hiſtory: Tho' poſſibly this <hi>worthy</hi> Confederacy may make uſe of thoſe few Corrections in thoſe 12 Sheets, in order to recommend their ſurreptitious Edition as preferable to that of the Proprietor. Of what will not Men be capable, who can corrupt the Servants of another Man to betray and rob their Maſter?</p>
            <p>The Editor, who had alſo great Reaſon to complain of the Treatment he met with in his <hi>Pamela,</hi> on both Sides the Water, cannot but obſerve, that never was Work more the Property of any Man, than <hi>this</hi> is his. The Copy never was in any other Hand: He borrows not from any Author: The Paper, the Printing, entirely at his own Expence, to a very large Amount; Returns of which he cannot ſee in ſeveral Months: Yet not troubling any of his Friends to leſſen his Riſque by a Subſcription: The Work, Copies of which have been ſo <hi>immorally</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0061902300:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obtained, is a <hi>moral</hi> Work: He has never hurt any Man; nor offended theſe: They would have had Benefits from the Sale, which the Editor could not have, being not a Bookſeller; and he always making full and handſome allowances <hi>to</hi> Bookſellers.</p>
            <p>But nothing leſs, it ſeems, would content theſe Men, than an Attempt to poſſeſs themſelves of his whole Property, without Notice, Leave, Condition, or Offer at Condition; and they are haſtening the Work at ſeveral Preſſes, poſſibly with a View to publiſh their piratical Edition before the lawful Proprietor can publiſh his. And who can ſay, that, if they can get it out before him, they will not advertiſe, that <hi>his</hi> is a Piracy upon <hi>theirs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet theſe Men know, that they have obtained the Parts of the Work they are poſſeſſed of, at the Price of making an innocent Man unſafe in his own Houſe; and of diſhonouring him in the Opinion of his Employers; who, probably, may not chooſe to truſt their Property in the Hands of a Man, who cannot ſecure his own from inteſtine Traitors.</p>
            <p>Since the above was written, Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> has been acquainted, that his Work is now print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Four ſeveral Printing-houſes in <hi>Dublin,</hi> for the Benefit of the Confederacy; <hi>viz.</hi> Two Volumes at Mrs. <hi>Reiley</hi>'s; One at Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi>'s; One at Mr. <hi>Powell</hi>'s; One at Mr. <hi>M'Culloch</hi>'s; and that they hope at Mrs. <hi>Reiley</hi>'s to get another Volume to print; and are driving on to finiſh their Two Volumes for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Work will make Seven Volumes in <hi>Twelves;</hi> Six in <hi>Octavo;</hi> and he apprehends, from the Quantity he himſelf had printed, when the Fraud was diſcovered, that the Confederacy have got Poſſeſſion of Five entire Volumes, the greateſt Part of the Sixth, and of ſeveral Sheets of the Seventh and laſt; but the Work being ſtopt when the Wickedneſs was known, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the better Half of the concluding Volume.</p>
            <p>He is further aſſured, that theſe worthy Men are in Treaty with Bookſellers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for their printing his Work, in that Part of the United Kingdom, from Copies that they are to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; and alſo, that they purpoſe to ſend a Copy to <hi>France,</hi> to be tranſlated there, before Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: No doubt for pecuniary Conſiderations; and in order to propagate, to the utmoſt, the Injury done to One, who never did any to them; and who, till this Proceeding, he bleſſes God, knew not that there were ſuch Men in the World among thoſe who could look out in broad and open Day.</p>
            <p>It has been cuſtomary for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bookſellers to make a Scramble among themſelves who ſhould firſt intitle himſelf to the Reprinting of a new <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book; and happy was he, who could get his Agents in <hi>England</hi> to ſend him a Copy of a ſuppoſed ſaleable Piece, <hi>as ſoon as it was printed,</hi> and <hi>ready to be publiſhed.</hi> This Kind of Property was never conteſted with them by Authors <hi>in England;</hi> and it was agreed among <hi>themſelves</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bookſellers and Printers) to be a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Title; tho' now-and-then a <hi>Shark</hi> was found, who preyed on <hi>his own Kind;</hi> as the News-papers of <hi>Dublin</hi> have teſtified. But the <hi>preſent</hi> Caſe will ſhew to what a Height of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuch an undiſputed Licence is arrived.</p>
            <p>After all, if there is no Law to right the Editor and ſole Proprietor of this new Work <hi>(New</hi> in every Senſe of the Word), he muſt acquieſce; but with this Hope, that, from ſo flagrant an Attempt, a Law may one Day be thought neceſſary, in order to ſecure to Authors the Benefit of their own Labours: Nor does he wiſh, that even theſe Invaders of his Property in <hi>Ireland</hi> may be excluded from the Benefit of it, in the Property of any of the Works to which they are, or ſhall be, fairly and lawfully intitled. At preſent, the <hi>Engliſh Writers</hi> may be ſaid, from the Attempts and Practices of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bookſellers and Printers, to live in an Age of <hi>Liberty,</hi> but not of <hi>Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> This is not a Contention between Bookſellers of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and on a <hi>doubtful</hi> Property; but between a lawful Proprietor of a <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Work — AND <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
