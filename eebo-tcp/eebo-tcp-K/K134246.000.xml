            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>FAR in a Wild, remote from publick view,</l>
            <l>From Youth to Age, a rev'rend Hermit grew,</l>
            <l>The Moſs his Bed, the Cave his humble Cell,</l>
            <l>His Food the Fruits, his Drink the Chryſtal Well:</l>
            <l>Unknown to Man, with God he paſs'd the Days,</l>
            <l>Pray'r all his Bus'neſs, all his Pleaſure Praiſe.</l>
            <l>A life ſo ſacred, ſuch ſerene Repoſe</l>
            <l>Seem'd Heaven itſelf; till one Suggeſtion roſe;</l>
            <l>That Vice ſhould triumph, Virtue Vice obey,</l>
            <l>Hence ſprung ſome Doubts of Providence's Sway;</l>
            <l>His Hopes no more a certain Proſpect boaſt,</l>
            <l>And all the Tenor of his Soul is loſt:</l>
            <l>To clear this Doubt, to know the World by Sight,</l>
            <l>To find if Books or Swains report it right;</l>
            <l>He with the Sun a riſing Journey went,</l>
            <l>Sedate to think and watching each Event.</l>
            <l>The Morn was waſted in the Pathleſs Graſs,</l>
            <l>And long and loneſome was the Wild to paſs;</l>
            <l>But when the ſouthern Sun had warm'd the Day</l>
            <l>A Youth came poſting o'er a croſſing Way.</l>
            <l>His rayment decent, his complexion fair,</l>
            <l>And ſoft in graceful Ringlets wav'd his Hair,</l>
            <l>Then near approaching, Father, Hail! he cry'd,</l>
            <l>And Hail, my ſon, the rev'rend Sire reply'd.</l>
            <l>Words followed Words, from Queſtions Anſwers flow'd</l>
            <l>And Talk of various kind deceiv'd the Road.</l>
            <l>Till each with other pleas'd and loth to part,</l>
            <l>While in their Age they differ, join in Heart,</l>
            <l>Thus ſtands an aged Elm in Ivy bound;</l>
            <l>Thus youthful Ivy claſps an Elm around.</l>
            <l>Now ſunk the Sun, the cloſing Hour of Day</l>
            <l>Came onward mantled o'er with Sober gray,</l>
            <l>Nature in Silence bid the World repoſe,</l>
            <l>When near the Road a ſtately Palace roſe,</l>
            <l>It chanc'd the generous Maſter of the Dome</l>
            <l>Still made his Houſe the wand'ring Strangers Home</l>
            <l>Yet ſtill the Kindneſs, from a thirſt of Praiſe</l>
            <l>Prov'd the vain flouriſh of expenſive Eaſe.</l>
            <l>The Pair arrive: The liv'ry'd Servants wait,</l>
            <l>Their Lord receives them at the pompous Gate</l>
            <l>The Table groans with coſtly Piles of Food,</l>
            <l>And all is more than hoſpitable good.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0748000700:2"/>Then led to reſt, the Day's long Toil they drown</l>
            <l>Deep ſunk in ſleep and Silk and Heaps of Down.</l>
            <l>At length 'tis Morn; and at the Dawn of Day</l>
            <l>Along the wide Canals the Zephyrs play,</l>
            <l>Up riſe the Gueſts obedient to the call,</l>
            <l>An early Banquet deck't the ſplendid Hall.</l>
            <l>Rich luſcious Wine a golden Veſſel grac'd</l>
            <l>Which the kind Maſter forc'd the Gueſts to taſte;</l>
            <l>Then pleaſ'd and thankful, from the Porch they go</l>
            <l>And, but the Landlord, none had cauſe of Woe:</l>
            <l>His Cup was vaniſh'd, for in ſecret Guiſe</l>
            <l>The younger Gueſt purloin'd the glittering Prize.</l>
            <l>As one who ſpies a Serpent in his Way</l>
            <l>Gliſt'ning and baſking in the ſummers Ray,</l>
            <l>Diſorder'd ſtops, to ſhun the Danger near,</l>
            <l>Then walks with Faintneſs on, and looks with Fear</l>
            <l>So ſeem'd the Sire when far upon the Road</l>
            <l>The ſhining ſpoil his wiley Partner ſhow'd;</l>
            <l>He ſtopp'd with Silence, walk'd with trembling Heart,</l>
            <l>And much he wiſh'd but durſt not aſk to part,</l>
            <l>Murmuring he lifts his Eyes and thinks it hard</l>
            <l>That generous Actions meet a baſe Reward.</l>
            <l>While thus they paſs the Sun his Glory ſhrouds</l>
            <l>The changing Skies hang out their Sable Clouds,</l>
            <l>A Sound in Air preſag'd approaching Rain</l>
            <l>And Beaſts to Covert ſcud a-croſs the Plain:</l>
            <l>Warn'd by the Signs the wand'ring Pair retreat</l>

            <l>'Twas built with Turrets on a riſing Ground,</l>

            <l>Its Owner's Temper, timorous and ſevere</l>
            <l>Unkind and griping caus'd a Deſart there.</l>
            <l>As near the Miſer's heavy Doors they drew</l>
            <l>Fierce riſing Guſts with ſudden Fury blew,</l>
            <l>The nimble Light'ning mix'd with Showers began</l>
            <l>And o'er their Heads loud rolling Thunder ran.</l>
            <l>Here long they knock', but knock or call in vain,</l>
            <l>Driv'n by the Wind and batter'd by the Rain;</l>
            <l>At length ſome Pity warm'd the Maſter's Breaſt</l>
            <l>'Twas then his Threſhold firſt receiv'd a Gueſt,</l>
            <l>Slow creaking turns the Door with jealous Care</l>

            <l>One frugal Faggot lights the naked Walls</l>

            <p>THE Inſpiration of God, and the clear Information of the Holy Scriptures aſſures us, that God reſerves his choiceſt Secrets for the pureſt Minds, and that its uncleaneſs of Spirit, not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Method in ſeeking after God, that ſeparates us from him; true Holineſs being the only ſafe Entrance into divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> declares Act. 10, 34, <hi>That he perceived of a Truth that God is no reſpecter of Perſons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted with him.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo tells the <hi>Galatians</hi> Chap. 6, 15, <hi>That in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſſion availeth any Thing, nor Uncircumciſſion but a new Creature.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Clearneſs of theſe and many more ſuch Doctrines contained in the Scriptures, Selfiſhneſs and Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, thoſe inhuman and baſe Qualities have been ſuffered to prevail even amongſt ſuch, as are eſteemed the moſt pious in the ſeveral Sects and Parties of the Chriſtian Church: They have raiſed and ſtill raiſe in every Communion, a ſelfiſh partial Orthodoxy, which conſiſts in courageouſly defending all its Opinions and Practices, and condemning the Doctrines and Practices of others; and thus every one is train'd up in Defence of their own Church, their own Truth, their own Opinion; And he often is judged to have the moſt Merit, and the moſt Honour, who likes every Thing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends every Thing amongſt themſelves, and leaves nothing uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in thoſe that are of a different Communion. Now how can Truth, Goodneſs and Religion be more ſtruck at, than by ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of it? If you ask why the great Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> wrote ſo many learned Books againſt all Parts of the Reformation, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was born in <hi>France,</hi> Had he been born in <hi>England,</hi> had he been bred <hi>at Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he might have rivall'd our great Biſhop <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> and would have wrote as many learn'd Folio's againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he has done. And yet I will venture to ſay, that if each Church could produce but one Man a Piece, that had the Piety of an Apoſtle, and the impartial Love of the firſt Chriſtians, they would not want half a Sheet of Paper to hold their Articles of Union, nor be half an Hour before they were of one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. If we loved Truth as ſuch; if we ſought it for its own ſake; if we loved our neighbours as our ſelves; if we deſir'd nothing by our Religion but to be acceptable to God; if we equally deſir'd the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Men; if we were afraid of Error only becauſe of its hurtful Nature to us, and our Brethren of other Communions, then nothing of this Spirit could have any Place in us. <hi>For God is Love, and they which dwell in God, they dwell in Love,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 16. That uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Love which gives the whole Strength of the Heart to God, and which makes us love every Man as we love ourſelves, is the nobleſt, the moſt divine, and God-like State of the Soul, and is the utmoſt Perfection to which the moſt perfect Religion can raiſe us, and no Religion does any Man any good, but ſo far, as it brings this perfect Love with it. Perfection can no where be found, but in a pure disintereſted Love of God and our Neighbour. There is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0748000700:7"/>therefore a Communion of Saints in the Love of God, which no one can learn from that which is called Orthodoxy in the different Sects, but is only to be had by a total Dying to all worldly Views, by a pure Love of God, and by ſuch an Unction from above, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the Mind from all Selfiſhneſs, and makes it love Truth and Goodneſs with an Equality of Affection in every Man, let his Name and Profeſſion to Religion be what it may. And by thus uniting in Heart and Spirit with all that is holy and good in all profeſſions, we enter into the true Communion of Saints, and become real Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true univerſal Chriſtian Church, tho' we are confin'd to the outward Worſhip of only one particular Part of it. It is thus, that the Angels, as miniſtring Spirits, aſſiſt, join, unite and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with every Thing that is holy and good in every Diviſion of Mankind. He that has been all his Life long uſed to look with great Slight upon thoſe of other Profeſſions, whom he has called <hi>Superſtitious Biggots, dreaming Viſionaries, canting Enthuſiaſts &amp;c.</hi> muſt naturally expect they will be treated by God, as they have been by him; and if he had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, ſuch People would find it hard, to get a Place in it. But it ſtands greatly in Hand to get rid of this Temper before we dye; for if nothing but univerſal Love can enter into the Kingdom of God, what can be more neceſſary for us, than to be full of this Love before we dye?</p>
            <p>We often hear of People of great Zeal and Orthodoxy, declaring on their Death-Beds their ſtrict Attachment to the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and making ſolemn Proteſtations againſt all other Churches; but how much better would it be, if ſuch a Perſon was to ſay, <q>In this divided State of Chriſtendom, I muſt conform to ſome outward divided Part of it, and therefore I have choſen to live and dye in outward Communion with the church of England; fully believing, that if I worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, in this divided Part of the Church, I ſhall be as acceptable to him, as if I had been a faithful Member of the one whole Church before it was broken into ſeparate Parts. But as I am now going out of this diſordered Diviſion, into a more univerſal State of Things, as I am going to the God of all Churches, to a Kingdom of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Love, which muſt have its Inhabitants from all People, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Languages of the Earth; ſo in this Spirit of univerſal Love, I deſire to perform my laſt Act of Communion in this divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, uniting and joining in Heart and Spirit with all that is Chriſtian, Holy, Good and acceptable to God in all other Churches; praying, from the Bottom of my Soul, that every Church may have its Saints; that God's Kingdom may come, his Will be done in every Diviſion of Chriſtians and Men, and that every Thing that hath Breath may praiſe the Lord?</q>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0748000700:8"/>THE Humble, Meek, Merciful, Juſt, Pious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Souls are every where of one Religion; and when Death has taken off the Maſk, they will know one another, tho' the divers Liveries they wear here makes them Strangers. Let us chuſe to commune where there is the warmeſt Senſe of Religion; where Devotion exceeds Formality, and Practice moſt correſponds with Profeſſion; and where there is at leaſt as much Charity as Zeal.

            <p>AN Eminent Servant of God who had known deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the dark Powers and experimentally felt the Powers of the World to come a few Hours before his Death, expreſſed himſelf in the following Words. <q>There is a Spirit which I feel, that delights to do no Evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all Things, in Hopes to enjoy its own in the End; Its Hope is, to outlive all Wrath and Contention, and to weary out all Exaltation and Cruelty, or whatſoever is of a Nature contrary to itſelf; it ſees to the End of all Temptations; as it bears no Evil in it ſelf, ſo it conceives none in Thought to any other; for its Ground and Spring is the Mercies and Forgiveneſs of God; its Crown is Meekneſs; its Life is everlaſting Love unfeigned, and takes its Kingdom with Intreaty, and not with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and keeps it by lowlineſs of Mind; in God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it can rejoice, tho' none elſe regard it, or can own its Life; 'tis conceived in Sorrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at Grief and Oppreſſion; it never rejoiceth but thro' Sufferings, for with the World's Joy it is murdered. I found it alone being forſaken: I have Fellowſhip therein with them that lived in Dens and deſolate Places of the Earth, who through Death obtained Reſurrection and eternal holy Life.</q>
