            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Tale is—what very few Tales now-a-days are,—true. The Hero of it no other than the Author himſelf. It was indeed <hi>catching the</hi> merriment <hi>as it roſe;</hi> for it was written in the New-market Coffee Room;—In which the Author, being elected a member of the Jockey Club, had the happineſs of paſſing ſeveral ſprightly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humoured Evenings—Juſt when the whimſical Adventure happened, which is here related.</p>
            <p>POETICAL Licence however (and is it not right that it ſhould be ſo?) has been taken. Particularly, in Juſtice to my own Perſon, I muſt declare that a certain figure of Speech, called by Rhetoricians Hyperbole or Exaggeration, has been made pretty free with.</p>

MY Reaſons for publiſhing it are twofold. One is my own: The other I borrowed from Lord SHAFTESBURY. The former is, without flattery, the merit of the Poem. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Heyday!—to be ſure!—why this is Impudence without a Parallel;"</q> ſays ſome Don Choleric or another.</p>
            <p>I cannot agree with you there, Sir Teſty—Pardon me, Sir,—hear my Explanation. Theſe Verſes have had the honour of being approved by thoſe whoſe Taſte it would be the higheſt Arrogance in me to call in queſtion. Now, Sir, what have you to ſay to that?</p>
            <p>THE latter is in order to let my friends have Copies of it, which they may be in no danger of not being able to read. And ſurely I may be rather excuſed for making the Preſs my Amanuenſis than the noble Lord, who might have had half a dozen Secretaries at his command. If I have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid enough, fifty other reaſons may be invented by my ingenious Readers.</p>
            <p>AND now for the Critics—Pray, good Gentlemen, be quiet. Do not apply your confounded Squares and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes to a Performance, whoſe Beauty—if it has any—but that, you know, is underſtood—conſiſts in a careleſs eaſe. What have your grave Countenances to do here?—It is not

at all becoming in People of your Dignity and Conſequence, to keep company with <hi>Cubs.</hi> What the Deuce! can't a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical fellow take a hearty laugh, but one of you <hi>ſage Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> muſt clap on a pair of damnation Spectacles, and ſtare him full in the Face, in order to find out Pimples upon his Noſe?</p>
            <p>COMMEND me, however, as much as you pleaſe. Take full ſcope there. And for your further encouragement, if you will tickle my fancy with a few obliging encomiums, I promiſe you a SCOTCH-PINT-BOTTLE of mine excellent Hoſt <note n="*" place="margin">At the BEDFORD-HEAD.</note> WILDMAN's beſt Claret; which, by the by, has been facetiously reckoned no ineffectual Bribe to one formidable <hi>Baſhaw</hi> amongſt you.</p>
            <p>JESTING apart. My dear Boy CUB! go along;—puſh thy way;—ſhift for thyſelf. All that is required of thee is, to relax the Muſcles of ſuch as have not got theſe organs of riſibility over and above conſtricted.—Play thy Part well; and reſt aſſured of eternal applauſe from thy loving PROGENITOR.</p>
