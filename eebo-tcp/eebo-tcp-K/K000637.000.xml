            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Publiſher's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE World is much indebted to the famous Sir
<hi>Humphry Poleſworth,</hi> for his ingenious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Account of <hi>John Bull</hi>'s Law-Suit; yet
there is juſt Cauſe of Complaint againſt him,
in that he retails it only by Parcels, and won't give
us the whole Work; This forces me, who am only the
Publiſher, to beſpeak the Aſſiſtance of his Friends and
Acquaintance, to engage him to lay aſide that ſtingy
Humour, and gratify the Curioſity of the Publick, at
once. He pleads in excuſe, that they are only private
Memoirs, wrote for his own Uſe, in a looſe Style, to
ſerve as a help to his ordinary Converſation. I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him the good Reception the two firſt Parts
had met, that tho' they had been calculated by him,
only for the Meridian of <hi>Grubſtreet,</hi> yet they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Notice of by the better ſort; that the World was
now ſufficiently acquainted with <hi>John Bull,</hi> and intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
it ſelf in his little Concerns. He Anſwer'd with
a Smile, that he had indeed ſome trifling Things to
impart that concerned <hi>John Bull</hi>'s Relations and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Affairs; if theſe would ſatisfy me, he gave
me free leave to make uſe of them, becauſe they would
ſerve to make the Hiſtory of the Law-Suit more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.
When I had look'd over the Manuſcript, I
found likewiſe ſome further Account of the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which perhaps may not be unacceptable to ſuch
as have read the two former Parts.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The Character of <hi>John Bull's</hi> Mother.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN</hi> had a Mother, whom he Lov'd and Honour'd
extremely, a Diſcreet, Grave, Sober Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd,
Cleanly Old Gentlewoman, as ever
liv'd; ſhe was none of your Croſs-grain'd termagant
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:5"/>
ſcolding Jades, that one had as good be hang'd as
live in the Houſe with, ſuch as are always cenſuring
the Conduct, and telling ſcandalous Stories of their
Neighbours, extolling their own good Qualities, and
undervaluing thoſe of others. On the contrary, ſhe
was of a Meek Spirit, and as ſhe was ſtrictly Virtuous
her ſelf, ſo ſhe always put the beſt Conſtruction upon
the Words and Actions of her Neighbours, except
where they were irreconcileable to the Rules of Honeſty
and Decency. She was neither one of your preciſe
<hi>Prudes,</hi> nor one of your phantaſtical old <hi>Belles,</hi> that
Dreſs themſelves like Girls of Fifteen; as ſhe neither
wore a Ruff, Fore-head Cloth, nor High-crown'd
Hat, ſo ſhe had laid aſide Feathers, Flowers, and
crimpt Ribons in her Head-dreſs, Furbulow Scarfs and
Hoop'd Petticoats. She ſcorn'd to Patch and Paint,
yet ſhe lov'd to keep her Hands and her Face Clean.
Tho' ſhe wore no flaunting lac'd Ruffles, ſhe would
not keep her ſelf in a conſtant Sweat with greaſy Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel:
Tho' her Hair was not ſtuck with Jewels, ſhe
was not aſham'd of a Diamond Croſs; ſhe was not
like ſome Ladies, hung about with Toys and Trinkets,
Twiſer Caſes, Pocket-Glaſſes and Eſſence Bottles; ſhe
us'd only a Gold Watch and an Almanack, to mark
the Hours and the Holy-Days. Her Furniture was
neat and genteel, well fancy'd with <hi>a bon Gouſt.</hi> As
ſhe affected not the Grandeur of a State with a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
ſhe thought there was no Offence in an Elbow
Chair; ſhe had laid aſide your Carving, Gilding and
Japan Work, as being too apt to gather Dirt, but
ſhe never could be prevail'd upon to part with plain
Wainſcot and clean Hangings. There are ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that affect to ſmell a ſtink in every Thing; they
are always highly perfum'd, and continually burning
Frankincenſe in their Rooms; ſhe was above ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
yet ſhe never would lay aſide the Uſe of
Brooms and ſcrubbing Bruſhes, and ſcrupl'd not to lay
her Linnen in freſh Lavender: She was no leſs genteel
in her Behaviour, well-bred without Affectation, in
the due mean between one of your affected Curſying
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:6"/>
pieces of Formality, and your Romps that have
no regard to the common Rules of Civility. There
are ſome Ladies that affect a Mighty regard for their
Relations; <hi>We muſt not Eat to Day, for my Uncle</hi> Tom<hi>,
or my Couſin</hi> Betty <hi>dy'd this time ten Years</hi>; <hi>Let's have
a Ball to Night, it is my Neighbour ſuch a ones Birth-day</hi>;
ſhe look'd upon all this as Grimace; yet ſhe conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerv'd her Husband's Birth-day, her Wedding-day,
and ſome few more. Tho' ſhe was a truly good
Woman, and had a ſincere Motherly Love for her Son
<hi>John,</hi> yet there wanted not thoſe who endeavour'd to
create a Miſunderſtanding between them, and they
had ſo far prevail'd with him once, that he turn'd her
out of Doors to his geeat Sorrow, as he found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
for his Affairs went all at ſixes and ſevens. She
was no leſs Judicious in the turn of her Converſation
and Choice of her Studies, in which ſhe far exceeded
all her Sex; your Rakes that hate the Company of all
ſober, grave Gentlewomen, would bear hers, and ſhe
would by her handſome manner of proceeding ſooner
reclaim than ſome that were more ſower and reſerv'd;
ſhe was a zealous Preacher up of Chaſtity, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Fidelity in Wives, and by no means a Friend to
the new-fangl'd Doctrine of the <hi>Indiſpenſible Duty of
Cuckoldom:</hi> Tho ſhe advanc'd her Opinions with a
becoming Aſſurance, yet ſhe never uſher'd them in,
as ſome poſitive Creatures will do, with dogmatical
Aſſertions, <hi>This is infallible; I cannot be miſtaken;
none but a Rogue can deny it.</hi> It has been obſerv'd that
ſuch People are oftner in the Wrong than any Body;
tho' ſhe had a thouſand good Qualities, ſhe was not
without her Faults, amongſt which one might perhaps
reckon too great Lenity to her Servants, to whom
ſhe always gave good Counſel, but often too gentle
Correction. I thought I could not ſay leſs of <hi>John
Bull</hi>'s Mother, becauſe ſhe bears a part in the following
Tranſactions.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. The Character of <hi>John Bull</hi>'s Siſter <hi>Peg,</hi> with the Quarrels
that happen'd between Maſter and Miſs, in their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN</hi> had a Siſter a poor Girl that had been ſtarv'd
at Nurſe; any Body would have gueſs'd Miſs to
have been bred up under the Influence of a cruel
Step-Dame, and <hi>John</hi> to be the Fondling of a tender
Mother. <hi>John</hi> look'd ruddy and plump, with a pair
of Cheeks like a Trumpeter; Miſs look'd pale and
wan, as if ſhe had the Green-Sickneſs; and no wonder
for <hi>John</hi> was the Darling, he had all the good Bits,
was cramm'd with good Pullet, Chicken, Pig, Gooſe
and Capon; while Miſs had only a little Oatmeal and
Water, or a dry Cruſt without Butter. <hi>John</hi> had his
golden Pippens, Peaches and Nectarnes; poor Miſs
a Crap Apple, Sloe or Blackberry. Maſter lay in the
beſt Apartment, with his Bed Chamber toward the
South Sun. Miſs lodg'd in a Garret, expos'd to the
North Wind, which ſhrevel'd her Countenance;
however, this Uſage tho it ſtunted the poor Girl in
her Growth, gave her a hardy Conſtitution; ſhe had
Life and Spirit in abundance, and knew when ſhe was
ill uſed; Now and then ſhe would ſeize upon <hi>John</hi>'s
Commons, ſnatch a Leg of a Pullet, or a bit of good
Beef, for which they were ſure to go to Fiſticuffs.
Maſter was indeed too ſtrong for her, but Miſs would
not yield in the leaſt Point, but ev'n when Maſter
had got her down, ſhe would ſcratch and bite like a
Tyger; when he gave her a Cuff on the Ear, ſhe
would prick him with her Knitting-Needle. <hi>John</hi>
brought a great Chain one Day to tye her to the Bed
Poſt, for which Affront Miſs aim'd a Pen-knife at his
Heart: In ſhort, theſe Quarrels grew up to rooted
Averſions, they gave one another Nicknames, ſhe
call'd him <hi>Gundyguts,</hi> and he call'd her Louſy <hi>Peg:</hi>
Tho' the Girl was a right clever Wench as any was,
and thro' her pale Looks, you might diſcern Spirit and
Vivacity, which made her not indeed a perfect Beauty,
but ſomething that was agreeable. It was barbarous
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:8"/>
in Parents not to take Notice of theſe early Quarrels,
and make them live better together, ſuch Domeſtick
Fewds proving afterwards the occaſion of Misfortunes
to them both. <hi>Peg</hi> had indeed ſome odd Humours and
comical Antipathy, for which <hi>John</hi> would jeer her.
<hi>What think you of my Siſter</hi> Peg (<hi>ſays he</hi>) <hi>that faints at
the Sound of an Organ, and yet will dance and frisk at the
Noiſe of a Bagpipe? What's that to you,</hi> Gundy-guts<hi>,
(quoth</hi> Peg<hi>) every Body's to chuſe their own Muſick.</hi>' Then
Peg had taken a Fancy not to ſay her <hi>Pater-noſter,</hi>
which made People imagine ſtrange things of her. Of
the three Brothers that have made ſuch a Clutter in
the World, Lord <hi>Peter, Martin</hi> and <hi>Jack</hi>; <hi>Jack</hi> had of
late been her Inclinations; Lord <hi>Peter</hi> ſhe deteſted;
nor did <hi>Martin</hi> ſtand much better in her good Graces,
but <hi>Jack</hi> had found the way to her Heart. I have
often admir'd what Charms ſhe diſcover'd in that
aukward Booby, till I talk'd with a Perſon that was
acquainted with the Intrigue, who gave me the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Account of it.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Jack</hi>'s Charms, or the Method by which he gain'd <hi>Peg</hi>'s
Heart.</head>
            <p>IN the firſt place, <hi>Jack</hi> was a very young Fellow, by
much the youngeſt of the three Brothers, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
indeed wonder'd how ſuch a young upſtart Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anapes
ſhou'd grow ſo pert and ſaucy, and take ſo
much upon him. (2.) <hi>Jack</hi> brag'd of greater Abilities
than other Men; he was well gifted, as he pretended;
I need not tell you what ſecret Influence that has upon
the Ladies. (3.) <hi>Jack</hi> had a moſt ſcandalous Tongue,
and perſuaded <hi>Peg</hi> that all Mankind beſides himſelf
were pox'd by that ſcarletfac'd Whore <hi>Signiora Bubo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
               <q rend="inline">As for his Brother Lord <hi>Peter,</hi> the Tokens
were evident in him Blotches, Scabs, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona:
His Brother <hi>Martin</hi> though he was not quite
ſo bad, had ſome nocturnal Pains, which his Friends
pretended were only Scorbutical; but, he was ſure,
proceeded from a worſe Cauſe.</q> By ſuch malicious
Inſinuations, he had poſſeſs'd the Lady, that he was
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:9"/>
the only Man in the World, of a ſound, pure, and
untainted Conſtitution: Tho' there were ſome that
ſtuck not to ſay, that <hi>Signiora Bubonia</hi> and <hi>Jack</hi> rail'd
at one another, only the better to hide an Intrigue;
and, that <hi>Jack</hi> had been found with <hi>Signiora</hi> under
his Cloak, carrying her home in a dark ſtormy Night.
(4.) <hi>Jack</hi> was a prodigious Ogler; he would Ogle
you the outſide of his Eye inward, and the White up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
(5.) <hi>Jack</hi> gave himſelf out for a Man of great
Eſtate in the Fortunate Iſlands, of which the ſole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
was veſted in his Perſon; by this Trick he chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
abundance of poor People of ſmall Sums, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to make over Plantations in the ſaid Iſlands;
but, when the poor Wretches came there with <hi>Jack</hi>'s
Grant, they were beat, mock'd, and turn'd out of
Doors. (6.) I told you that <hi>Peg</hi> was whimſical, and
lov'd any thing that was particular: In that way <hi>Jack</hi>
was her Man; for he neither thought, ſpoke, dreſs'd,
nor acted like other Mortals: He was for your bold

in the World; inſtead of the common Faſhion,
he would viſit his Miſtreſs in a Mourning Cloak, Band,
ſhort Cuffs, and a peaked Beard. He invented a way
of coming into a Room backwards, which he ſaid ſhew'd
more Humility, and leſs Affectation: where other
People ſtood, he ſat; where they ſat, he ſtood; when
he went to Court, he us'd to kick away the State, and
ſit down by his Prince Cheek by Choul, <hi>Confound theſe
States</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they are a modern Invention</hi>; when he

upon him; if he was advis'd to faſt for his Health he
would eat Roaſt beef; if he was allow'd a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Diet, then he would be ſure that Day to live
upon Watergruel; he would cry at a Wedding, laugh
and make Jeſts at a Funeral. He was no leſs ſingular
in his Opinions; you would have burſt your ſides to
hear him talk Politicks: <q rend="inline">All Governments (ſays
he) is founded upon the right Diſtribution of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;
decent Executions keep the World in
awe; for that Reaſon the Majority of Mankind
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:10"/>
ought to be hang'd every Year; for Example, I
ſuppoſe, the Magiſtrate ought to paſs an irreverſible
Sentence upon all blue-ey'd Children from the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
but that there may be ſome ſhew of Juſtice in
his proceeding, theſe Children ought to be Train'd
up, by Maſters appointed for that purpoſe, to all
ſorts of Villany, that they may deſerve their Fate,
and the Execution of them may ſerve as an Object
of Terror to the reſt of Mankind.</q> As to the giving
of Pardons he had this ſingular Method, That when
theſe Wretches had the Ropes about their Necks, it
ſhould be enquired, who believ'd they ſhould be
hanged, and who not? The firſt were to be Pardon'd,
the laſt hang'd out-right: Such as were once par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
were never to be hang'd afterwards, for any
Crime whatſoever. He had ſuch Skill in Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that he would pronounce peremptorily upon a
Mans Face, That Fellow (ſays he) do what he will,
can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t avoid Hanging; he has a hanging Look. By
the ſame Art, he would prognoſticate a Principality
to a Scoundrel. He was no leſs particular in the
Choice of his Studies; they were generally bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
exploded Chimera's, the <hi>perpetum Mobile,</hi> the
circular Shot, Philoſopher's Stone, and ſilent Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
making Chains for Flea's, Nets for Flies,
and Inſtruments to unrevel Cobwebs, and ſplit Hairs.
Thus, I think, I have given you a diſtinct Account of
the Methods he practis'd upon <hi>Peg.</hi> Her Brother would
now and then ask her. <q rend="inline">What a Devil doſt thou ſee
in that pragmatical Coxcomb, to make thee ſo in
Love with him? He is a fit Match for a Tailor or a
Shoemaker's Daughter, but not for you that are a
Gentlewoman. Fancy is free (quoth <hi>Peg</hi>) I'll take
my awn way, do you take yours; I do no care for
your flaunting Beaus, that gang with their Breaſts
open, and their Sarks over their Waiſtcoats, that
accoſt me with ſet Speeches out of <hi>Sidney</hi>'s <hi>Arcadia,</hi>
or, <hi>The Academy of Compliments. Jack</hi> is a ſober grave
Youngman; tho' he has none of your ſtudy'd Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,
his Meaning is ſincere: He has a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

to his Father's Will; and he that ſhews himſelf
a good Son, will make a good Husband; beſides, I
know he has the Original Deed of Conveyance to
the Fortunate Iſlands; the others are Counterfeits.</q>
There is nothing ſo obſtinate as young Ladies in their
Amours; the more you Croſs them, the Worſe they

            <head>CHAP. IV. How the Relations reconcil'd <hi>John</hi> and his Siſter <hi>Peg,</hi> and
what return <hi>Peg</hi> made to <hi>John's</hi> Meſſage.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN BULL,</hi> otherwiſe a good natur'd Man,
was very hard-hearted to his Siſter <hi>Peg,</hi> chiefly
from an Averſion he had conceived in his Infancy.
While he flouriſh'd, kept a warm Houſe, and drove a
plentiful Trade, poor <hi>Peg</hi> was forc'd to go hawking
and pedling about the Streets, ſelling Knives, Sciſſars
and Shoe-buckles; now and then carry'd a Basket of
Fiſh to the Market; ſow'd, ſpun and knit for a poor
Livelihood, till her Fingers-end were ſore; and when
ſhe could not get Bread for her Family, ſhe was forc'd
to hire 'em out at Journey-work to her Neighbours;
Yet in theſe her poor Circumſtances, ſhe ſtill preſerv'd
the Air and Mien of a Gentlewoman; a certain decent
Pride, that extorted Reſpect from the haughtieſt of
her Neighbours; when ſhe came into any full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
ſhe would not yield the <hi>pas</hi> to the beſt of them.
If one ask'd her, Are not you related to <hi>John Bull</hi>?
Yes (ſays ſhe) he has the Honour to be my Brother.
So <hi>Peg</hi>'s Affairs went, till all the Relations cry'd out
ſhame upon <hi>John,</hi> for his barbarous Uſage of his own
Fleſh and Blood; that it was an eaſie matter for him
to put her in a credible way of living, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Hurt, but with Advantage to himſelf, being ſhe
was an induſtrious Perſon, and might be ſerviceable
to him in his way of Buſineſs. Hang her, Jade, (quoth
<hi>John</hi>) I can't endure her, as long as ſhe keeps that
Raſcal <hi>Jack</hi>'s Company. They told him, the way to
reclaim her was to take her into his Houſe; that by
Converſation, the childiſh Humours of their younger
days might be worn out. Theſe Arguments were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:12"/>
by a certain Incident. It happen'd that <hi>John</hi>
was at that time about making his Will, and entailing
his Eſtate, the very ſame in which <hi>Nic. Frog</hi> is nam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d
Executor. Now his Siſter <hi>Peg</hi>'s Name being in the
Entail, he could not make a thorough Settlement
without her Conſent. There was indeed a malicious
Story went about as if <hi>John</hi>'s laſt Wife had fall'n in
love with <hi>Jack,</hi> as he was eating Cuſtard a Horſeback;
that ſhe perſwaded <hi>John</hi> to take his Siſter <hi>Peg</hi> into
the Houſe the better to drive on her Intrigue with
<hi>Jack,</hi> concluding he would follow his Miſtreſs <hi>Peg.</hi> All
I can infer from this Story is, that when one has got
a bad Character in the World, People will report
and believe any thing of them, true or falſe. But to
return to my Story; when <hi>Peg</hi> receiv'd <hi>John</hi>'s Meſſage,
ſhe huff'd and ſtorm'd like the Devil: <q rend="inline">My Brother
<hi>John</hi> (quoth ſhe) is grown wondrous kind hearted
all of a ſuddain, but I meikle doubt, whether it be
not mair for his awn Conveniency than my good; he
draws up his Weits and his Deeds forſooth, and I
mun ſet my Hand to them, unſight unſeen. I like
the young Man he has ſettled upon well enough, but
I think I ought to have a valuable Conſideration
for my Conſent: He wants my poor little Farm,
becauſe it makes a Nook in his Park Wall; ye may
e'en tell him, he has mair than he makes good uſe
of; he gangs up and down drinking, roaring and
quarrelling through all the Countrey Merkats ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fooliſh Bargins in his Cups, which he repents
when he is ſober; like a thriftleſs Wretch, ſpending
the Goods and Gear that his Fore-Fathers won with
the Sweat of their Brows; light come, light go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
cares not a Farthing: But why ſhould I ſtand Surety
for his ſilly contracts? the little I have is free, and
I can call it my own; Hame's hame be it never ſo
hamely; I ken him well enough, he could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
me, and when he has his ends he'll e'en uſe me
as he did before; I'm ſure I ſhall be treated like a
poor Drudge; I ſhall be ſet to tend the Bairns, darn
the Hoſe, and mend the Linnen. Then there's no
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:13"/>
living with that auld Carline his Mother, ſhe rails
at <hi>Jack</hi> and <hi>Jack</hi>'s an honeſter man than any of her
Kin: I ſhall be plagu'd with her Spells and her <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters</hi>
and ſilly auld warld Ceremonies: I mun ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pair my Nails on a Friday, nor begin a Journy
on <hi>Childermas day,</hi> and I mun ſtand becking and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
as I gang out and into the Hall: Tell him he
may e'en gan his get, I'll have nothing to do with
him, I'll ſtay like the poor Country Mouſe, in my
own Habitation.</q> So <hi>Peg</hi> talkt; but for all that,
by the Interpoſition of good Friends, and by many a
bonny thing that were ſent and many more that were
promis'd <hi>Peg,</hi> the matter was concluded, and <hi>Peg</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the Houſe upon certain Articles; one of
which was, That ſhe might have the Freedom of <hi>Jack</hi>'s
Converſation, and might take him for Better and for
Worſe, if ſhe pleas'd; provided always, he did not
come into the Houſe at unſeaſonable Hours, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb

one ſide, and moderate the Reſentments on the other;
a good Friend acts both parts, the one without the

was ill paid; then <hi>Peg</hi> lov'd a little good Liquor, and
the Servants ſhut up the Wine-Cellar, but for that <hi>Peg</hi>

complain'd that they were debar'd from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

thing within the Houſe; if they offered to come into
the Warehouſe, then ſtrait went the Yard ſlap over
their Noddle; if they ventur'd into the Counting-Room,
a Fellow would throw an Ink bottle at their
Head; if they came into the beſt Apartment, to ſet
any thing there in order, they were ſaluted with a

it was odds but the Cook laid them over the

up into the Coach box, were told, that one of
their Companions had been there before that could
not drive, then ſlap went the long Whip about their
Ears: On the other Hand it was complain'd, that <hi>Peg</hi>'s
Servants were always asking for Drink-Money, that they
had more than their ſhare of the <hi>Chriſtmas-box</hi>; to ſay
the Truth, <hi>Peg</hi>'s Lads buſtl'd pretty hard for that, for
when they were endeavouring to Lock it up, they got
in their great Fiſts, and pull'd out Handfuls of Half-Crowns,
ſome Shillings and Six-pences, others in the
Scramble pick'd up Guineas and Broad-pieces. But
there happen'd a worſe thing than all this, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
that <hi>Peg</hi>'s Servants had great Stomachs, and
brought too many of their Friends and Acquaintance
to the Table; that <hi>John</hi>'s Family was like to be Eat
out of Houſe and Home. Inſtead of regulating this
Matter as it ought to be, <hi>Peg</hi>'s young Men were thruſt
away from the Table; then there was the Devil and
all to do, Spoons, Plates and Diſhes, flew about the
Room like mad, and Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> who was now <hi>Major
Domo,</hi> had enough to do to quiet them. <hi>Peg</hi> ſaid this

was contrary to Agreement, whereby ſhe was in all
things to be treated like a Child of the Family; then
ſhe call'd upon thoſe that had made her ſuch fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,

               <p>After we had come back to the Tavern, and
taken t'other Bottle of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> we quarrell'd a
little about the Diviſion of the Eſtate; <hi>Lewis</hi> hall'd
and pull'd the Map on one ſide, and <hi>Frog</hi> and I on t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till we had like to have tore the Parchment to
pieces. At laſt <hi>Lewis</hi> pull'd out a pair of great Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's
Shears and clip'd off a Corner for himſelf, which
he ſaid was a Mannor that lay convenient for him,
and left <hi>Frog</hi> and me the reſt to diſpoſe of, as we pleas'd.
We were over-joy'd, to think <hi>Lewis</hi> was contented with
ſo little, not ſmelling what was at the bottom of the
Plot. There happen'd, indeed, an Incident, that
gave us ſome Diſturbance; A Cunning Fellow, one
of my Servants, two Days after, peeping through the
Key-hole, obſerv'd that Old <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſtole away
our part of the Map, and ſaw him fiddling and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Map from one Corner to the other, trying to
join the two pieces together again: He was mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſomething to himſelf, which he did not well hear,
only theſe Words, <hi>'Tis great Pity, 'tis great Pity</hi>! My
Servant added, that he believ'd this had ſome ill-meaning;
I told him he was a Coxcomb, always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be Wiſer than his Companions; <hi>Lewis</hi> and
I are good Friends, he's an honeſt Fellow, and, I dare
ſay, will ſtand to his Bargain. The Sequel of the
Story prov'd this Fellow's Suſpicion to be too well-grounded;
for <hi>Lewis</hi> reveal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d our whole Secret to the
Deceas'd Lord <hi>Strutt,</hi> who, in Reward to his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and Revenge to <hi>Frog</hi> and me, ſettled his whole
Eſtate upon the preſent <hi>Philip Baboon</hi>: Then we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
what he meant by piecing the Map toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>Why, truly Wife, it was not eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to the common Methods, but then it was the
Faſhion to do ſuch things: I have read of your Golden
Age, your Silver Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one might juſtly call this
the Age of the Lawyers. There was hardly a Man
of Subſtance in all the Country, but had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Counterfeit
that pretended to his Eſtate: As the Philoſophers
ſay, that there is a Duplicate of every Terreſtrial A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
at Sea, ſo it was in this Age of the Lawyers,
there was at leaſt two of every thing; nay, o' my
Conſcience, I think there were three Eſquire <hi>Hackums</hi>
at one time. <hi>Lewis Baboon</hi> entertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d a Fellow that
call'd himſelf <hi>John Bull</hi>'s Heir; I knew him no more
than the Child unborn, yet he brought me into ſome
Trouble and Expence. There was another that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be Eſq. <hi>South</hi>; and two Lord <hi>Strutts,</hi> you
know. In ſhort, it was uſual for a parcel of Fellows
to meet, and diſpoſe of the whole Eſtates in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
<hi>This lies convenient for me</hi> Tom; <hi>Thou would do
more good with that</hi> Dick, <hi>than the Old Fellow that has it</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So to Law they went with the true Owners; the
Lawyers got well by it, every Body elſe was undone.
It was a common thing for an honeſt Man, when he
came Home at Night, to find another Fellow domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
in his Family, hectoring his Servants, calling
for Supper, and pretending to go to Bed to his Wife.
In every Houſe you might obſerve two <hi>Sofia</hi>'s quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling

            <p>AS <hi>John Bull</hi> and his Wife were talking together,

(quoth Sir <hi>Roger</hi>) <hi>leave them to me.</hi> And in eed it
was pleaſant enough to obſerve Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s Method
with theſe importunate Duns; his ſincere Friendſhip
for <hi>John Bull,</hi> made him ſubmit to many things, for his
Service, which he would have ſcorn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to have done
for himſelf. Sometimes he would ſtand at the Door
with his long Poll to keep off the Duns, 'till <hi>John</hi> got
out at the Back-Door. When the Lawyers and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
brought extravagant Bills, Sir <hi>Roger</hi> us'd to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
before hand, for leave to cut off a quarter of a
Yard in any part of the Bill he pleaſed; he wore a

Cellar, and gage the Casks: In his leiſure Minutes he
<pb facs="tcp:0147503600:21"/>
was poſting his Books, and gathering in his Debts;
uch frugal Methods were neceſſary where Money was
ſo ſcarce, and Duns ſo numerous. All this while <hi>John</hi>
kept his Credit, could ſhow his Head both at <hi>Change</hi>
and <hi>Weſtminiſter-Hall</hi>; no Man proteſted his Bill, nor
refus'd his Bond, only the Sharpers and the Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
the Lawyers and other Clerks pelted Sir <hi>Roger</hi>
as he went along. The Squirters were at it with their
Kennel-Water, for they were mad for the loſs of their
Bubble, and that they could not get him to Mortgage
the Mannor of <hi>Bullocks Hatch.</hi> Sir <hi>Roger</hi> ſhook his Ears

was doing a charitable Work, in reſcuing an honeſt
Man from the Claws of <hi>Harpies</hi> and Blood-ſuckers.
Mrs. Bull did all that an affectionate Wife, and a good

However I don't blame you for vindicating your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

of Iniquity. The Witneſſes made Oath, That they
had heard ſome of the Livery-men frequently railing at
their Miſtreſs. <q rend="inline">They ſaid, She was a troubleſome
fiddle faddle old Woman, and ſo ceremonious that
there was no bearing of her. They were ſo plagu'd
with bowing and cringing as they went in and out of
the Room, that their Backs ach'd; ſhe us'd to ſcold
at one for his dirty Shoes, at another for his greaſie
Hair, and not combing his Head: Then ſhe was ſo
paſſionate and fiery in her Temper, that there was no
living with her; ſhe wanted ſomething to ſweeten
her Blood; that they never had a quiet Night's reſt,
for getting up in the Morning to early Sacraments;
