            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not my intention, in this preface, to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece. I am afraid there are too many: But thoſe who are beſt able to diſcover, will be moſt ready to pardon them. They alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is: and this is a firſt attempt.</p>
            <p>I beg leave only to mention the reaſon that determined me to make choice of this ſubject. What pleaſed me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, tho' perhaps it will not be leaſt liable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with ordinary readers, was the great ſimplicity of the ſtory. It is one, regular, and uniform, not charged with a multiplicity of incidents, and yet afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral revolutions of fortune; by which the paſſions may be excited, varied, and driven to their full tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of emotion</p>
            <p>This unity of deſign was always ſought after, and admired by the antients: and the moſt eminent among the moderns, who underſtood their writings, have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to imitate them in this, from an intire conviction that the reaſon of it muſt hold good in all ages. And here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to tranſlate a paſſage from the celebrated <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Racine,</hi> which contains all that I have to ſay on this head.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">We muſt not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of thoſe who made it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can touch us in tragedy, but what is probable. And what probability is there, that, in one Day, ſhould happen a multitude of things, which could ſcarce happen in ſeveral Weeks? There are ſome wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> think that this ſimplicity is a mark of barrenneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> invention. But they do not conſider, that, on the
<pb facs="tcp:1269801800:5"/>
contrary, invention conſiſts in making ſomething out of nothing: and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets, who did not find in their genius either richneſs or force enough to engage their ſpectators, for five acts together, by a ſimple action, ſupported by the violence of paſſions, the beauty of ſentiments, and the nobleneſs of expreſſion.</q>—I would not be underſtood to mean that all theſe things are to be found in my performance: I only ſhew the reader what I aimed at, and how I would have pleaſed him, had it been in my power.</p>
            <p>As to the character of <hi>Sophoniſba</hi>; in drawing it, I have confined myſelf to the truth of hiſtory. It were an affront to the age, to ſuppoſe ſuch a character out of nature; eſpecially in a country which has produced ſo many great examples of public ſpirit and heroic virtues, even in the ſofter ſex: and I had deſtroyed her character intirely, had I not marked it with that ſtrong love to her country, diſdain of ſervitude, and inborn averſion to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which all hiſtorians have diſtinguiſhed her. Nor ought her marrying <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> while her former huſband was ſtill alive, to be reckoned a blemiſh in her character. For, by the laws both of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> the captivity of the huſband diſſolved the marriage of courſe; as among us impotence, or adultery: not to mention the reaſons of a moral and public nature, which I have put into her own mouth in the ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and <hi>Syphax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all I have to ſay of the play itſelf. But I cannot conclude without owning my obligations to thoſe concerned in the repreſentation. They have indeed done me more than juſtice. Whatever was deſigned as amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and engaging in <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> ſhines out in Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s action. Mrs. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> in the character of <hi>Sophoniſba,</hi> has excelled what, even in the fondneſs of an author, I could either wiſh or imagine. The grace, dignity, and happy variety of her action have been univerſally applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are truly admirable.</p>

               <l>COME, gentle <hi>Venus!</hi> and aſſwage</l>
               <l>A warring world, a bleeding age.</l>
               <l>For nature lives beneath thy ray,</l>
               <l>The wintry tempeſts haſte away,</l>
               <l>A lucid calm inveſts the ſea,</l>
               <l>Thy native deep is full of thee;</l>
               <l>And flowering earth, where'er you fly,</l>
               <l>Is all o'er ſpring, all ſun the ſky.</l>
               <l>A genial ſpirit warms the breeze;</l>
               <l>Unſeen, among the blooming trees,</l>
               <l>The feather'd lovers tune their throat,</l>
               <l>The deſart growls a ſoften'd note,</l>
               <l>Glad o'er the meads the cattle bound,</l>
               <l>And love and harmony go round.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But chief, into the human heart</l>
               <l>You ſtrike the dear delicious dart;</l>
               <l>You teach us pleaſing pangs to know,</l>
               <l>To languiſh in luxurious woe,</l>
               <l>To feel the generous paſſions riſe,</l>
               <l>Grow good by gazing, mild by ſighs;</l>
               <l>Each happy moment to improve,</l>
               <l>And fill the perfect year with love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come, thou delight of heaven and earth!</l>
               <l>To whom all creatures owe their birth;</l>
               <l>Oh come, red-ſmiling! tender, come!</l>
               <l>And yet prevent our final doom.</l>
               <l>For long the furious god of war</l>
               <l>Has cruſh'd us with his iron car,</l>
               <l>Has rag'd along our ruin'd plains,</l>
               <l>Has curs'd them with his cruel ſtains,</l>
               <l>Has clos'd our youth in endleſs ſleep,</l>
               <l>And made the widow'd virgin weep.</l>
               <l>

Now let him feel thy wonted charms;</l>
               <l>Oh take him to thy twining arms!</l>
               <l>And, while thy boſom heaves on his,</l>
               <l>While deep he prints the humid kiſs,</l>
               <l>Ah then! his ſtormy heart controul,</l>
               <l>And ſigh thy ſelf into his ſoul.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy ſon too, <hi>Cupid,</hi> we implore,</l>
               <l>To leave the green <hi>Idalian</hi> ſhore;</l>
               <l>Be he, ſweet god! our only foe;</l>
               <l>Long let him draw the twanging bow,</l>
               <l>Transfix us with his golden darts,</l>
               <l>Pour all his quiver on our hearts,</l>
               <l>With gentler anguiſh make us ſigh,</l>
               <l>And teach us ſweeter deaths to die.</l>
