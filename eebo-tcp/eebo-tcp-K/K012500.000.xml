            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>I AM as ready as the moſt rigid Critic, to confeſs, that nothing can be more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and inartificial than the plans of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Dramas. In the conſtruction of them I have ſeldom ventured to introduce any perſons <note n="*" place="bottom">Never, indeed, except in DANIEL, and that of neceſſity; as the Bible furniſhes no more than two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Daniel and Darius; and theſe were not ſufficient to carry on the buſineſs of the Piece.</note> of my own creation: Still leſs did I imagine myſelf at liberty to invent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. I reflected, with awe, that <hi>the place whereon I ſtood was holy ground.</hi> All the latitude I permitted myſelf, was, to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0425300200:4"/>make ſuch perſons as I ſelected, act under ſuch circumſtances as I found, and expreſs ſuch ſentiments as, in my humble judgment, appeared not unnatural to their ſituations.— Some of the ſpeeches are ſo long as to retard the action; for I rather aſpired after moral inſtruction, than the purity of Dramatic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The very terms of Act and Scene are avoided, becauſe I was unwilling to awaken the attention of the Reader to my deficiencies in critical exactneſs.</p>
            <p>It may be thought that I have choſen, perhaps, the leaſt important paſſage in the eventful Life of David, for the foundation of the Drama which bears his name. Yet even in this, his firſt exploit, the ſacred Hiſtorian repreſents him as exhibiting no mean leſſon of modeſty, humility, courage,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0425300200:5"/>and piety: virtues not only admirable, but imitable; and within the reach of every Reader. Many will think that the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Saul's daughter would have add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the effect of the piece: and I have no doubt but that it would have made the intrigue more complicated and more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting, had this Drama been intended for the Stage. There, all that is tender, and all that is terrible in the paſſions, find a proper place. But I write for the Young, in whom it will be always time enough to have them awakened; I write for a claſs of Readers, to whom it is not eaſy to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate one's ſubject <note n="*" place="bottom">It would not be eaſy, I believe, to introduce Sacred Tragedies on the Engliſh Stage. The ſcrupulous would think it profane, while the profane would think it dull. Yet the excellent RACINE, in a diſſipated country, and a voluptuous court, ventured to adapt the ſtory of <hi>Athaliah</hi> to the French Theatre; and it remains to us a glorious monument of its Author's courageous piety, and of the perfection of the Dramatic Art.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0425300200:6"/>A very judicious and learned friend has remarked, that the <hi>Reflections of King Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> breathe rather too much of the ſpirit of Chriſtianity; for that it is ſcarcely probable he had ſo ſettled a belief in the general judgment. I feel the juſtneſs of the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without having been able to obviate it. I wiſhed to convey a ſtrong idea of this great leading truth, and have, perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, aſcribed ſentiments to a Jewiſh monarch, merely becauſe I wiſhed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them on the Chriſtian Reader.</p>
            <p>The Critic and the Scholar, if any ſuch ſhould honour theſe pages with their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0425300200:7"/>will find ample matter on which to exerciſe their candor and their charity; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſo natural to genius and to learning, that even the feebleneſs of my performance will not be able to obſtruct the exertion of them in favour of my intention.</p>
            <p>The amiable Poet <note n="*" place="bottom">Cowley.</note> from whom I have taken my motto, after ſhewing the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the Sacred, over the Profane Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories (ſome inſtances of which I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed in my Introduction), concludes with the following remark, which I may apply to myſelf with more propriety than it was uſed by the Author:— <q>I am far from aſſuming to myſelf, to have fulfilled the duty of this weighty undertaking; and I ſhall be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0425300200:8"/>of no other fruit from this weak and imperfect attempt of mine, but the opening of a way to the courage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of ſome other perſons, who may be better able to perform it thoroughly and ſucceſsfully.</q>
