            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>First in these fields I try the sylvan strains,</l>
               <l>Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains:</l>
               <l>Fair Thames! flow gently from thy sacred spring,</l>
               <l>While on thy banks Sicilian muses sing;</l>
               <l>Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play,</l>
               <l>And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>You, that too wise for pride, too good for pow'r,</l>
               <l>Enjoy the glory to be great no more,</l>
               <l>And carrying with you all the world can boast,</l>
               <l>To all the world illustriously are lost!</l>
               <l>O let my Muse her slender reed inspire,</l>
               <l>Till in your native shades you tune the lyre:</l>
               <l>So when the nightingale to rest removes,</l>
               <l>The thrush may chant to the forsaken groves,</l>
               <l>But charm'd to silence, listens while she sings,</l>
               <l>And all th' aërial audience clap their wings.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews.</l>
               <l>Two swains, whom love kept wakeful, and the muse,</l>
               <l>Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their ſleecy care,</l>
               <l>Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair:</l>
               <l>The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side.</l>
               <l>Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephon thus reply'd.</l>

               <l>With joyous music wake the dawning day!</l>
               <l>Why sit we mute, when early linnets sing.</l>
               <l>When warbling Philomel salutes the spring?</l>

               <l>Sing then, and Damon shall attend the strain,</l>
               <l>While yon' slow oxen turn'd the furrow'd plain.</l>
               <l>Here the bright crocus and blue vi'let glow;</l>
               <l>Here western winds on breathing roses blow.</l>
               <l>I'll stake yon' lamb, that near the fountain plays,</l>
               <l>And from the brink his dancing shade surveys.</l>

               <l>The various seasons of the rolling year;</l>

               <l>A milk-white bull shall at your altars stand,</l>
               <l>That threats a fight, and spurns the rising sand.</l>

               <l>O Love! for Sylvia let me gain the prize,</l>
               <l>And make my tongue victorious as her eyes:</l>
               <l>No lambs or sheep for victims I'll impart,</l>
               <l>Thy victim, Love, shall be the shepherd's heart.</l>

               <l>Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain,</l>
               <l>Then, hid in shades, eludes her eager swain;</l>
               <l>But feigns a laugh, to see me search around,</l>

               <l>The bleating sheep with my complaints agree,</l>
               <l>They parch'd with heat, and I inflam'd by thee,</l>

               <l>In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides,</l>

As in the crystal spring I view my face,</l>
               <l>Fresh rising blushes paint the wat'ry glass;</l>
               <l>But since those graces please thy eyes no more,</l>
               <l>I shun the fountains which I sought before.</l>
               <l>Once I was skill'd in ev'ry herb that grew,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry plant that drinks the morning dew;</l>
               <l>Ah, wretched shepherd, what avails thy art,</l>

               <l>Embrace my love, and bind my brows with bays.</l>
               <l>That flute is mine which Colin's tuneful breath</l>
               <l>Inspir'd when living, and bequeath'd in death:</l>
               <l>He said, Alexis, take this pipe, the same</l>
               <l>That taught the groves my Rosalinda's name:</l>
               <l>But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree,</l>
               <l>For ever silent, since despis'd by thee.</l>
               <l>Oh! were I made by some transforming power</l>
               <l>The captive bird that sings within thy bow'r!</l>
               <l>Then might my voice thy list'ning ears employ</l>

               <l>The nymphs, forsaking every cave and spring,</l>

               <l>Accept the wreath which you deserve alone,</l>

               <l>In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd,</l>
               <l>And chaste Diana haunts the forest-shade.</l>
               <l>Come, lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours,</l>

               <l>This harmless grove no lurking viper hides,</l>

               <l>The wond'ring forests soon should dance again,</l>
               <l>The moving mountains hear the pow'rful call.</l>

               <l>To closer shades the panting flocks remove;</l>
               <l>Ye Gods! and is there no relief for love?</l>
               <l>But soon the sun with milder rays descends</l>

               <l>Hylas and Aegon sung their rural lays;</l>
               <l>This mourn'd a faithless, that an absent love,</l>
               <l>And Delia's name and Doris' fill'd the grove.</l>
               <l>Ye Mantuan Nymphs, your sacred succour bring,</l>

               <l>Whose sense instructs us, and whose humour charms,</l>

               <l>To Delia's ear the tender notes convey.</l>
               <l>As some sad turtle his lost love deplores,</l>
               <l>And with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores;</l>
               <l>Thus, far from Delia, to the winds I mourn,</l>

Ye Flow'rs that droop, forsaken by the spring,</l>

               <l>Through rocks and caves the name of Delia sounds,</l>

                  <l>" Let nature change, let heav'n and earth deplore,</l>
                  <l>" Fair Daphne's dead, and love is now no more!"</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>'T is done; and Nature's various charms decay,</l>
                  <l>See gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day!</l>
                  <l>Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear,</l>
                  <l>Their faded honours scatter'd on her bier.</l>
                  <l>See, where on earth the flow'ry glories ly,</l>
                  <l>With her they flourish'd, and with her they die.</l>
                  <l>Ah! what avail the beauties Nature wore?</l>
                  <l>Fair Daphne's dead, and beauty is no more!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For her the flocks refuse their verdant food,</l>
                  <l>The thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood,</l>
                  <l>The silver swans her hapless fate bemoan,</l>
                  <l>In notes more sad than when they sing their own;</l>
                  <l>In hollow caves sweet Echo silent lies,</l>
                  <l>Silent, or only to her name replies;</l>
                  <l>Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore,</l>
                  <l>Now Daphne's dead, and pleasure is no more!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>No grateful dews descend from ev'ning skies,</l>
                  <l>Nor morning odours from the flow'rs arise;</l>
                  <l>No rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field.</l>
                  <l>Nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield.</l>
                  <l>The balmy zephyrs, silent since her death,</l>
                  <l>Lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath;</l>
                  <l>Th' industrious bees neglect their golden store!</l>
                  <l>Fair Daphne's dead, and sweetness is no more!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>No more the mounting larks, while Daphne sings,</l>
                  <l>Shall, list'ning in mid air, suspend their wings;</l>
                  <l>No more the birds shall imitate her lays,</l>
                  <l>Or, hush'd with wonder, hearken from the sprays:</l>
                  <l>No more the streams their murmurs shall forbear,</l>
                  <l>A sweeter music than their own to hear,</l>
                  <l>But tell the reeds, and tell the vocal shore,</l>
                  <l>Fair Daphne's dead, and music is no more!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Her fate is whisper'd by the gentle breeze,</l>
                  <l>And told in sighs to all the trembling trees;</l>
                  <l>The trembling trees, in ev'ry plain and wood,</l>
                  <l>Her fate remurmur to the silver flood;</l>

The silver flood, so lately calm, appears</l>
                  <l>Swell'd with new passion, and o'erflows with tears;</l>
                  <l>The winds, and trees, and floods, her death deplore,</l>
                  <l>Daphne, our grief, our glory now no more!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But see! where Daphne wond'ring mounts on high</l>
                  <l>Above the clouds, above the starry sky!</l>
                  <l>Eternal beauties grace the shining scene,</l>
                  <l>Fields ever fresh, and groves for ever green!</l>
                  <l>There while you rest in amaranthine bow'rs,</l>
                  <l>Or from those meads select unfading flow'rs,</l>
                  <l>Behold us kindly, who your name implore,</l>
                  <l>Daphne, our goddess, and our grief no more!</l>

               <l>How all things listen while thy Muse complains!</l>
               <l>Such silence waits on Philomela's strains,</l>
               <l>In some still ev'ning, when the whisp'ring breeze</l>
               <l>Pants on the leaves, and dies upon the trees.</l>
               <l>To thee, bright Goddess, oft' a lamb shall bleed,</l>

               <l>Arise, the pines a noxious shade diffuse;</l>
               <l>Sharp Boreas blows, and Nature feels decay,</l>
               <l>Time conquers all, and we must Time obey.</l>
               <l>Adieu, ye Vales, ye Mountains, Streams and Groves;</l>
               <l>Adieu, ye Shepherds' rural Lays and Loves;</l>
               <l>Adieu, my Flocks; farewell, ye Sylvan Crew;</l>
               <l>Daphne, farewell; and all the World adieu!</l>
