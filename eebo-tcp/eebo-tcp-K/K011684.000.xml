            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  <p>At the requiſition and deſire of ſeveral of the Freeholders of the County, I am, in the abſence of the Sheriff, to deſire the favour of your attendance, at a Meeting to be held at Epſom, on Monday the 18th inſtant, at 12 o'clock at noon, to conſider of an Humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his MAJESTY, to expreſs our grateful approbation of his MAJESTY'S paternal and well-timed attention to the public welfare, in his late moſt gracious Proclamation againſt the Enemies of our happy Conſtitution.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>Taking it for granted, that the aforeſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, equally as obſcure as the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0250104400:3"/>to which it refers, has nevertheleſs ſome meaning, and is intended to effect ſome purpoſe; and as a proſecution (whether wiſely or unwiſely, juſtly or unjuſtly) is already commenced againſt a work intitled <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> of which I have the honour and the happineſs to be the author; I feel it neceſſary to addreſs this Letter to you, and to requeſt that it may be read publicly to the Gentlemen who ſhall meet at Epſom in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that Advertiſement.</p>
            <p>The work now under proſecution is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the ſame work which is intended to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the aforeſaid Proclamation. Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this to be the caſe, the Gentlemen of the county of Surrey are called upon by ſomebody to condemn a work, and they are at the ſame time forbidden by the Proclamation to know what that work is; and they are further called upon to give their aid and aſſiſtance to prevent other people from knowing it alſo.—It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary that the author, for his own juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as well as to prevent the Gentlemen who ſhall meet from being impoſed upon by miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, ſhould give ſome out-lines of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and plans which that work contains.</p>
            <p>The work, Sir, in queſtion contains, firſt, an inveſtigation of general principles of Government.</p>
            <p>It alſo diſtinguiſhes Government into two claſſes or ſyſtems, the one the hereditary ſyſtem—the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0250104400:4"/>other the repreſentative ſyſtem; and it compares thoſe two ſyſtems with each other.</p>
            <p>It ſhews, that what is called Hereditary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot exiſt as a matter of right; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Hereditary Government always means a Government yet to come; and the caſe always is, that thoſe who are to live afterwards have always the ſame right to eſtabliſh a Government for themſelves as the People had who lived before them.</p>
            <p>It alſo ſhews the defect to which Hereditary Government is unavoidably ſubject; that it muſt, from the nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle, or unfitted for it from want of capacity. JAMES the II'd. and many others are recorded in the Engliſh hiſtory, as proofs of the former of thoſe caſes, and inſtances are to be found almoſt all over Europe, to prove the truth of the latter.</p>
            <p>It then ſhews, that the Repreſentative Syſtem is the only true ſyſtem of Government; that it is alſo the only ſyſtem under which the liberties of any People can be permanently ſecure; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is the only one that can continue the ſame equal probability at all times of admitting of none but men properly qualified, both by principles and abilities, into the Government, and of excluding ſuch as are otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0250104400:5"/>The work ſhews alſo, by plans and calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not hitherto denied nor controverted, not even by the proſecution that is commenced, that the taxes now exiſting may be reduced at leaſt ſix millions, that taxes may be entirely taken off from the Poor, who are computed at one-third of the nation, and that the taxes on the other two-thirds may be very conſiderably reduced—that the aged Poor may be comfortably provided for, and the children of poor families properly educated—that fifteen thouſand ſoldiers, and the ſame number of ſailors, may be diſbanded, and allowed three ſhillings per week during life out of the ſurplus taxes; and alſo, that a proportionate allowance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the remaining ſoldiers and ſailors be encreaſed; and that it is better to apply the ſurplus taxes to thoſe purpoſes, than to conſume them on lazy and profligate placemen and penſioners; and that the revenue, ſaid to be twenty thouſand pounds per annum, raiſed by a tax upon coals, and given to the Duke of RICHMOND, is a groſs impoſition upon all the people of London, and ought to be inſtantly aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is a conciſe abſtract of the principles and plans contained in the work that is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and for the ſuppreſſion of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation appears to be intended: But as it is impoſſible that I can, in the compaſs of a letter,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0250104400:6"/>bring into view all the matters contained in the work, and as it is proper that the Gentlemen who may compoſe that Meeting ſhould know what the merits or demerits of it are, before they come to any reſolutions, either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly relating thereto, I requeſt the honour of preſenting them with one hundred copies of the ſecond part of RIGHTS OF MAN, and alſo one thouſand copies of my letter to Mr. DUNDAS, which I have directed to be ſent to Epſom for that purpoſe; and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of preſenting them to the Gentlemen who ſhall meet on that occaſion, with my ſincere wiſhes for their happineſs, and for that of the Nation in general.</p>
            <p>Having now cloſed thus much of the ſubject of my letter, I next come to ſpeak of what has rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me perſonally. I am well aware of the delicacy that attends it, but the purpoſe of calling the Meeting appears to me ſo inconſiſtent with that juſtice that is always due between man and man, that it is proper I ſhould (as well on account of the Gentlemen who may meet, as on my own account) explain myſelf fully and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly thereon.</p>
            <p>I have already informed the Gentemen, that a proſecution is commenced againſt a work of which I have the honour and happineſs to be the author, and I have good reaſons for believing, that the Proclamation which the Gentlemen are called to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0250104400:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſider, and to preſent an Addreſs upon, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely calculated to give an impreſſion to the Jury before whom that matter is to come. In ſhort, that it is dictating a verdict by proclamation; and I conſider the inſtigators of the meeting to be held at Epſom, as aiding and abetting the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and in my opinion illegal purpoſe, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I ſhall now ſhew.</p>
            <p>Had a Meeting been called of the Freeholders of the County of Middleſex, the Gentlemen who had compoſed that Meeting, would have rendered themſelves objectionable as perſons to ſerve on a Jury before whom the judicial caſe was afterwards to come. But by calling a Meeting out of the County of Middleſex, that matter is artfully avoided, and the Gentlemen of Surrey are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, as if it were intended thereby to give a tone to the ſort of verdict which the inſtigators of the Meeting no doubt wiſh ſhould be brought in, and to give countenance to the Jury in ſo doing.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>I am, Sir, With much reſpect to the Gentlemen who ſhall meet, Their and your Obedient humble ſervant, THOMAS PAINE.</signed>
