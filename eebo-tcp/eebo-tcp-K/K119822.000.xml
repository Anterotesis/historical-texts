            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LEGAL MEANS OF POLITICAL REFORMATION.</head>
            <p>NEVER were the baneful effects of <hi>undue influence</hi> more ſenſibly felt, or more generally acknowledged, than at preſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>legal</hi> means of curbing this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous evil are propoſed in two little tracts preſented with this paper. The one points out a <hi>legal</hi> mode of obtaining a <hi>more equal repreſentation of the Commons.</hi> The other demonſtrates the ancient po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular right of holding <hi>new-elected</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <q>
                  <hi>every year once, and more often if need be.</hi>
               </q> And the ſum of both, jointly conſidered, may be included in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhort propoſition: — that <hi>a more equal repreſentation of the Commons in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Parliaments (i. e.</hi> ELECTED <q>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year once, and more often if need
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1222600400:3"/>be</q>) <hi>is not only an</hi> ANCIENT, <hi>but even an</hi> INDISPENSABLE, <hi>right of the people.</hi> That this ancient conſtitution is <hi>indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable</hi> the many fatal effects of deviating from it have rendered ſufficiently obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and therefore no <hi>remedy</hi> can be more efficacious, and conſtitutionally natural, than a <hi>revival</hi> of that <hi>primitive and fundamental right,</hi> according to the rule of Law, that, <q>
                  <hi>as often as any thing is doubtful or</hi> CORRUPTED, <hi>we ſhould</hi> RECUR <hi>to firſt principles.</hi>

                     <p>THE circumſtances of thoſe antient times are ſo totally different, in many reſpects, from the preſent times, that it is difficult to determine whether any ſuch <hi>joint</hi> elections of knights, citizens,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1222600400:13"/>and burgeſſes, (by the united equal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of all the electors together, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree, in each county,) can now be made; and, of courſe, it is doubtful whether ſuch a meaſure is even adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Many laws have ſince been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted reſpecting elections, all of which muſt firſt be well weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for, if any thing therein is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the neceſſary alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it muſt be repealed by the ſame authority which ordained it; becauſe <q>

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet, as the injuſtice and fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the preſent enormous <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of repreſentation</hi> in favour of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty venal boroughs (to the diſadvantage of the counties and great cities) is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and undeniable, ſome prudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is ſurely become neceſſary, and ought to be moſt earneſtly ſought after
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1222600400:14"/>by all lovers of peace and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The ruinous effects of a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>parliamentary corruption,</hi> and of its baneful companion, <hi>national repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy,</hi> (which is the ſure harbinger of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic misfortune</hi> and <hi>approaching ſlavery,</hi>) have made ſuch haſty advances of late, that many people begin to be alarmed, and to talk ſeriouſly concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of endeavouring to obtain. <q>
                           <hi>a more equal repreſentation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in annual parliaments,</hi> as the true legal means of reſtoring public credit, and of ſaving the ſtate.</q> Such a diſpoſition, towards parliamentary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I have perceived in ſeveral places, amongſt people who have not the leaſt connexion with each other, ſo that it ſeems to be the moſt natural and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious concluſion of common ſenſe upon the preſent alarming ſtate of public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and will, probably, (if matters
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1222600400:15"/>ſhould grow worſe,) become more and more general, till the meaſure be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly demanded by the voice of the people; in which caſe, all thoſe perſons, who have been moſt concerned in the management of the public treaſury, muſt expect to undergo a ſevere ſcrutiny! Or, if any ſudden invaſion of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enemies ſhould be really intended, (which there is but too much reaſon to ſuſpect,) the people, it is to be feared, as ſoon as they are informed of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic danger, will be ſo tranſported with ſudden indignation againſt particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe meaſures may ſeem to have contributed to the national weakneſs, that they will not eaſily be reſtrained from violent and inconſiderate acts of perſonal reſentment! And it is not at all probable that the people will be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly or ſufficiently united to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common enemy, until they have taken ſuch ſteps as they may think
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1222600400:16"/>effectual to inſure a reformation of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (in caſe their endeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common enemy ſhould prove ſucceſsful,) and to prevent the like cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in future.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1222600400:17"/>againſt thoſe perſons, who, by a change of conduct, give proofs of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for popular and conſtitutional rights. And the almoſt certain advantages to the crown, by adopting and promoting ſuch a meaſure, will be <hi>the recovery of a great and extenſive empire;</hi>

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1222600400:20"/>The king might ſafely ſignify (in a ſpeech to his parliament or by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) his earneſt deſire to be more accurately informed of the ſentiments of his people; and that he therefore wiſhes to promote, by legal and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional means, a <hi>more equal repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of all perſons who are at preſent entitled to vote for <hi>knights, citizens,</hi> and <hi>burgeſſes,</hi> in parliament, that elections may be made in an <hi>equitable and juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the</hi> NUMBERS of thoſe who vote for each denomination, without leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the total number of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſent up at preſent from each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and he might refer the conſideration of the moſt juſt and unexceptionable means of doing this to the very perſons whoſe rights are concerned, by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing his ſheriffs to ſummon grand-juries, in their reſpective counties, to conſider and propoſe the moſt equitable mode of ſending the preſent number of knights,

                        <note n="*" place="bottom">"By the aſſent of the whole county."</note> And, in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1222600400:22"/>other example for the county of Wilts, wherein only <hi>twenty-ſix perſons,</hi> named in the indenture, are ſaid to have choſen <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen repreſentatives</hi> (viz.two knights, two citizens, and twelve burgeſſes) <hi>in one joint election;</hi> yet we muſt not conſider the ſaid twenty-ſix perſons as the only electors, but rather as an <hi>acting commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi> empowered by the whole body of electors in that county; for, though the words <hi>"aſſenſu totius comitatus illius"</hi> are omitted, yet the beginning of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture expreſſly informs us that it was made "<hi>in pleno com.

                        </note>" &amp;c.

                     <p>The moſt obvious means of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are either to divide each county into ſo many equal diſtricts as may moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be repreſented by 2, 3, or 4, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, ſo as to include the whole number now ſent from each county; or elſe to <hi>chooſe the whole number of knights, citizens, and burgeſſes, by the joint ſuffrages of all the electors together, at the county-court,</hi> agreeably to the ancient examples already cited. By theſe regulations, indeed, the borough-voters might complain that they would be injured by loſing a large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their borough Repreſentation; that is, they would certainly loſe that <hi>unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proportion</hi> of repreſentation which is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1222600400:24"/>injurious to the rights and freedom of their neighbours; but they would be ſo far from loſing any <hi>juſt and equitable right,</hi> really due to themſelves, that they would actually gain thereby <hi>a right</hi> of voting for all the <hi>knights</hi> and <hi>citizens,</hi> as well as for all the <hi>other</hi> deputed <hi>burgeſſes,</hi> of their reſpective counties; to which, at preſent, (as mere burgeſſes of one borough,) they have no pretence.

                  <p>—THE authority of the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> Legiſlature in 1650 was entirely <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal,</hi> as well as that in 1653, both of them having been ſet up and maintained by the ſame unconſtitutional arbitrary power; and both of them totally void of the indiſpenſable <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of the people: for though the wretched remains of the Long-Parliament in 1650 (being
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1222600400:37"/>about 80 Repreſentatives or Members, inſtead of 513 that had been elected at the beginning of that Parliament) were indeed choſen by a ſmall part of the people of England, yet the legal <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,</hi> even of that ſmall part, was <hi>out of date</hi> and void, from the length of time that the ſaid Repreſentation had continued <hi>without Re-election,</hi> which was about ten years; whereas it is well known that the due effect, or <hi>virtue,</hi> of popular <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> was formerly ſuppoſed to be incapable (like ſome <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi> fruits) of being ſo long preſerved in uſeful purity, without a <hi>ſeaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal,</hi> from time to time; ſo that our more prudent Anceſtors (imitating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) required alſo an <hi>annual</hi> renewal of their <hi>parliamentary Repreſentation,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary for the maintenance of public virtue.</p>
                  <p>Sir Edw. Coke, in his 4th Inſt. p. 9, ſpeaking of "the matters of parliament,"
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1222600400:38"/>informs us of the reaſons uſually expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the writs for calling a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <q>pro quibuſdam arduis urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus negotiis, nos ſtatum, et defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem regni noſtri Angliae, et Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae Anglicanae concernentibus quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam parliamentum noſtrum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> teneri ordinavimus,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he adds, in the next paragraph, <q>Now, for as much</q> (ſays he) <q>as divers Laws and Statutes have been enacted and provided for theſe ends aforeſaid, and that divers miſchiefs in particular, and that divers miſchiefs in particular, and divers grievances in general, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the honour and ſafety of the King, the State, and Defence of the Kingdome, and of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, might be prevented, <hi>an excellent Law</hi> was made, anno 36 Edw. III. c. 10. which, <hi>being applied to the ſaid Writs of Parliament,</hi> doth, in a few and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual words, ſet down the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a Parliament in theſe words:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1222600400:39"/>
                        <hi>For the maintenance of the ſaid articles, and ſtatutes, and redreſs of divers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and grievances, which daily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi> A PARLIAMENT SHALL BE HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN EVERY YEAR, as another time was ordained by a ſtatute.</q> Which Statute, here referred to, was made in the 4th year of the ſame reign, cap. 14. <q>Item, it is accorded, that a Parliament ſhall be holden EVERY YEAR ONCE, <hi>and more often if need be.</hi>
                     </q> But Sir William Blackſtone ſuppoſes that the King never was <q>obliged, by theſe Statutes, to call a <hi>new</hi> Parliament <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year;</hi> but only to permit a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſit annually for the redreſs of grievances, and diſpatch of buſineſs, <hi>if need be.</hi>
                     </q> (1 Com. c. 2, p. 153.)</p>
                  <p>It is too true, indeed, that our Kings, in general, did not think themſelves "<hi>obliged,</hi> by theſe Statutes," (as they ought in conſcience to have been, for the ſafety of their ſouls,) <q>to call a <hi>new
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1222600400:40"/>Parliament every year:</hi>
                     </q> nay, it is certain that many of them would never have called a Parliament at all, had they not been <hi>"obliged"</hi> by neceſſity and the circumſtances of the times. But by what authority could a repreſentative in one Parliament take his ſeat in the <hi>next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Parliament,</hi> without <hi>re-election,</hi> before any laws were made for lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duration of Parliaments? And beſides, if the King did <q>
                        <hi>only permit</hi> a Parliament to ſit annually,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by what authority could the Parliament be convened at all, under ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſeeing that a <hi>mere permiſſion to ſit</hi> excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year? However, the learned commentator himſelf very juſtly obſerves, in a preceding page, (150,) concerning "the manner and time of aſſembling," that the <q>Parliament is regularly to be ſummoned by the King's <hi>Writ,</hi> or Letter, iſſued out of Chancery.</q> And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1222600400:41"/>it is well known that theſe Writs are not addreſſed to the knights, citizens, and burgeſſes, elected for any <hi>former</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to <hi>the Sheriffs alone,</hi> to cauſe <hi>Knights, Citizens, &amp;c. to be elected;</hi> for, when the ſaid Acts were made, ſuch an abſurdity in politics had never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in England, as that of truſting the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of the people, for <hi>a term of years,</hi> (as at preſent,) to the perſons elected! On the contrary, when the buſineſs of each Seſſion was finiſhed, the Parliament, of courſe, was at an end; and therefore Lord Coke did not ſpeak in vain, when he mentioned <hi>"the excellent Law"</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Act for <hi>annual</hi> Parliaments) <q>
                        <hi>being applied to the ſaid Writs of Parliament,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. before recited.</p>
                  <p>A man of ſo much good ſenſe, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and judgement, as Sir William Blackſtone is maſter of, muſt be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the pernicious effects of inveſting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1222600400:42"/>the Repreſentatives of the people with a legiſlative power, beyond the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal term of A SINGLE SESSION, without <hi>Re-election;</hi> and therefore I cannot but be ſurprized at the unguarded manner in which he has expreſſed himſelf in his Comment on the two <hi>excellent Statutes</hi> of Edward III. for <hi>annual</hi> Parliaments; <hi>viz.</hi> that the King is not, <q>or ever was, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by theſe Statutes to call <hi>a new</hi> Parliament every year,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He has cauſed the word <hi>new</hi> to be printed in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics,</hi> as if he meant thereby to inſinuate, that the Legiſlatures of thoſe early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation a kind of <hi>continued ſenatorial dignity,</hi> without <hi>Re-election,</hi> for ſeveral years together; whereas he certainly muſt have known that this corrupt <hi>modern</hi> practice has produced a <hi>new order</hi> of men amongſt us, a moſt dangerous increaſe of ariſtocratical power, which was entirely
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1222600400:43"/>unknown to our Anceſtors in the glorious reign of Edward III. If he could ſhew that there <hi>ever</hi> was a Parliament, in thoſe times, that was <hi>not a</hi> NEW <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> his Comment might be juſtified! But it is notorious that Writs were iſſued to the Sheriffs, for <hi>new</hi> Elections, almoſt <hi>every year</hi> during that whole reign: The Writs, for the moſt part, are ſtill preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the Returns upon them. In the catalogue of Election-Writs, which Prynne has given in his <hi>Brevia Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaria Rediviva,</hi> p. 4 to 6, there is an account of Writs iſſued for <hi>new</hi> Elections in every year of that King's reign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his 34th (when the laſt Act for annual Parliaments was made) and his 50th year, except 3, <hi>viz.</hi> the 40th, 41ſt, and 48th, years; in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are alſo wanting, as appears by Sir William Dugdale's <q>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1222600400:44"/>Copy of Summons to Parliament of the Nobility,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet this affords no abſolute proof that Parliaments were not holden <hi>in thoſe very years</hi> for which the Writs are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe the bundles of Writs for the ſaid years may have been loſt or miſlaid. The only wonder is, that more have not been loſt, when we conſider the very little care that had been taken of them; for Prynne found many of theſe Writs diſperſed among a vaſt miſcellane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heap of other records on various ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, (as he himſelf relates in his Epiſtle-Dedicatory to King Charles II. of his <hi>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,)</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſaid heap a <q>
                        <hi>confuſed Chaos,</hi> under corrding putrifying cobwebs, duſt, and filth, in the darkeſt corner of Caeſar's Chapel in the White Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as <hi>mere uſeleſs Reliques not worthy to be calendred,</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, in page 103 of that ſame work, he ſpeaks of 117
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1222600400:45"/>Bundles of Writs, whereof 97 had only been then <hi>lately</hi> diſcovered, filed, and bundled, by himſelf: <q>But many of theſe 117 Bundles</q> (ſays he) <q>are <hi>not compleat,</hi> above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, maymed, torn, or <hi>utterly loſt,</hi> through careleſſneſs, wet, cankers, or other caſualties; and ſome of them have not above two, three, or four Writs, and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that there were really Writs for Parliaments, even in thoſe <hi>three</hi> years, which appear to be wanting, at leaſt in <hi>two</hi> of them, is very certain; becauſe it was in the 40th year of this reign, as Sir Edward Coke informs us, (4 Inſt. p. 13,) that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III. <q>whereupon the King, in the <hi>ſame
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1222600400:46"/>year, calleth his Court of Parliament,</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In this Parliament it was unanimouſly agreed, by the Prelates, Dukes, Counts, Barons, and <hi>Commons,</hi> ("et <hi>la Commun,</hi>" and again, <hi>"et Communes,"</hi>) <q>that the ſaid King John, nor no other, could put himſelf, nor his Realm, nor his People, in ſuch Subjection, without their <hi>Aſſent</hi> ('ſans aſſent de eux'); and, if it was done, it was done without their Aſſent,</q> (that is, without the Aſſent of the <hi>Common;</hi> for the Aſſent of the Barons was expreſſed in the Charter,) <q>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Oath at his Coronation,</q> p. 14. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Lord Coke remarks, in the margin, that <q>no King can put himſelf, nor his Realm, nor his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in ſuch Subjection, without Aſſent of the <hi>Lords and Commons in Parliament,</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> &amp;c. as Sir Edward Coke proves from the Parliament-Rolls of that year, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 8, remarking, at the ſame time, that the Act then made was "never yet printed." See the margin, 4th Inſt. p. 13.</p>
                  <p>And it appears that a Parliament was held alſo in the 48th year of this reign, becauſe ſupplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament, as related by Sir Richard Baker, in his Chronicle, p. 173, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>in his eight and fortieth year,</hi> IN A PARLIAMENT, is granted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1222600400:47"/>him a 10th of the Clergy, and a 15th of the Laity.</q> So that there is but <hi>one</hi> year, out of ſo many, in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments: And <hi>annual</hi> Writs for <hi>new</hi> Elections were regularly iſſued for the firſt 18 years of the following reign, (as appears by Prynne's <q>2d part of a brief Regiſter and Survey of the ſeveral kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs,</q> pages 116 and 117,) till Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard II. (that wretched perjured monarch) had rendered himſelf <hi>abſolute.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">His arbitrary proceedings very ſoon afterwards oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned his own Loſs of Power, and total Fjectment from the Throne; ſo that, notwithſtanding his boaſted <hi>Firmneſs</hi> in executing his favourite meaſures, he was at laſt reduced to the moſt abject acknowledgements of his own unworthineſs to reign.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>After conſidering theſe unqueſtionable evidences of the iſſuing Writs <hi>annualy</hi> for <hi>new</hi> Elections, it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Blackſtone's Comment on the ſaid two
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1222600400:48"/>Acts for <hi>annual</hi> Parliaments: <q>Not that he (the King) is, or ever was, obliged by theſe Statutes to call a <hi>new</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every year; but only to permit a Parliament to ſit annually for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of grievances and diſpatch of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, <hi>if need be.</hi> — Theſe laſt words</q> (ſays he) <q>are ſo <hi>looſe and vague,</hi> that ſuch of our monarchs, as were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to govern without Parliaments, neglected the convoking them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a conſiderable period, under pretence that there <hi>was no need of them,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>"theſe laſt words"</hi> are not <q>
                        <hi>ſo looſe and vague</hi>
                     </q> as either to juſtify his own explanation of the ſaid Statues, (<hi>viz.</hi> not <q>to call a <hi>new</hi> Parliament every year, but only to <hi>permit</hi> a Parliament to ſit,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or to excuſe, in the leaſt degree, the criminal neglects of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them: for the words,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1222600400:49"/>
                     <hi>"if need be,"</hi> cannot, according to the moſt obvious ſenſe of the Act wherein they are found, be applied to the main purpoſe of the Act, (the holding <hi>annual Parliaments,</hi>) but merely to the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the ſentence, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>and more often:</hi>
                     </q> that is, <q>and more often, if need be.</q> The Order, <q>
                        <hi>that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhall be holden</hi> EVERY YEAR ONCE,</q> is abſolute; and the diſcretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power, expreſſed in the words <q>
                        <hi>if need be,</hi>
                     </q> relates apparently to the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Parliaments <hi>"more often:"</hi> for, if the ſaid diſcretionary words, <hi>"if need be,"</hi> could, with any propriety, be applied to the whole ſentence, the Act itſelf would have been nugatory; which could never be the <hi>intention</hi> of the Legiſlature: but the true meaning and ſenſe of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very clearly proved by the hiſtories of thoſe times: for it is manifeſt, not only that <hi>new</hi> Repreſentatives were elected <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year</hi> (with only one exception) for a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1222600400:50"/>conſiderable number of years after the laſt of the ſaid Acts was made, (which confirms the main purpoſe of the Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> the holding <hi>annual Parliaments,</hi>) but it is alſo manifeſt, that Parliaments were frequently holden <hi>"more often"</hi> than once a year; <note n="*" place="bottom">Writs were iſſued for electing 3 <hi>new</hi> Parliaments in the 6th year of Edw. III. 2 in his 11th year, 3 in his 12th year, and even 4 in his 14th year; and there appear to have been 2 <hi>new</hi> Parliaments in the 7th of Rich. II. See <hi>Prynne's Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</hi> p. 5 &amp; 6.</note> which amply confirms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what I have before ſaid, concerning the meaning of the diſcretionary power, expreſſed in the ſaid Act, by the words <hi>"if need be."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe very frequent Elections (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two, three, and four, times IN ONE YEAR) ſufficiently prove that the power, delegated by the people to their Repreſentatives, continued no longer in force than during the Seſſion of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parliament to which they were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1222600400:51"/>ſummoned; which being <q>
                        <hi>once determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>

And therefore Judge Blackſtone's inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, againſt the calling of a <hi>new</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, has no real foundation: for, if it was the intention of the Legiſlature, in the two Acts abovementioned, that the King ſhould ever ſummon <hi>any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean a <hi>new</hi> Parliament on all occaſions; <hi>i. e.</hi> not only that the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parliaments, which they ordained <q>
                        <hi>to be</hi> holden every <hi>year once,</hi>

                        <hi>and more often, if need be.</hi>
                     </q> The meaning of the Act is <hi>unqueſtionably</hi> proved by the actual iſſuing of writs, to the Sheriffs, for electing Knights, Citizens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>two, three,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>four, new</hi> Parliaments, <hi>in one year,</hi> as mentioned above: And if any perſon ſhould object, that ſuch <hi>very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Elections</hi> muſt be attended with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable difficulties and inconveniences, we may quote the experience of all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, as affording ample and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofs to the contrary; <q>there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above two or three caſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections queſtioned, or complained of, from 49 Hen.
