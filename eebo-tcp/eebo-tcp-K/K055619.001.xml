            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>DEDICATION. TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>EVERY liberal motive that can actuate an Authour in the dedication of his labours, concurs in directing me to you, as the perſon to whom the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing work ſhould be inſcribed.</p>
            <p>If there be a pleaſure in celebrating the diſtinguiſhed merit of a contemporary, mixed with a certain degree of vanity not altogether inexcuſable, in appearing fully ſenſible of it, where can I find one in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting whom I can with more general approbation gratify thoſe feelings? Your excellence, not only in the Art over which you have long preſided with
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0548300101:4"/>
unrivalled fame, but alſo in Philoſophy and elegant Literature, is well known to the preſent, and will continue to be the admiration of future ages. Your equal and placid temper, your variety of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, your true politeneſs, by which you are ſo amiable in private ſociety, and that enlarged hoſpitality which has long made your houſe a common centre of union for the great, the accompliſhed, the learned, and the ingenious; all theſe qualities I can, in perfect confidence of not being accuſed of flattery, aſcribe to you.</p>
            <p>If a man may indulge an honeſt pride, in having it known to the world, that he has been thought worthy of particular attention by a perſon of the firſt eminence in the age in which he lived, whoſe company has been univerſally courted, I am juſtified in availing myſelf of the uſual privilege of a Dedication, when I mention that there has been a long and uninterrupted friendſhip between us.</p>
            <p>If gratitude ſhould be acknowledged for favours received, I have this opportunity, my dear Sir, moſt ſincerely to thank you for the many happy hours which
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0548300101:5"/>
I owe to your kindneſs—for the cordiality with which you have at all times been pleaſed to welcome me—for the number of valuable acquaintances to whom you have introduced me—for the <hi>noctes coenaeque Deûm,</hi> which I have enjoyed under your roof.</p>
            <p>If a work ſhould be inſcribed to one who is maſter of the ſubject of it, and whoſe approbation, therefore, muſt enſure it credit and ſucceſs, the Life of Dr. Johnſon is, with the greateſt propriety, dedicated to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, who was the intimate and beloved friend of that great man; the friend, whom he declared to be <q rend="inline">"the moſt invulnerable man he knew; with whom, if he ſhould quarrel, he ſhould find the moſt difficulty how to abuſe."</q> You, my dear Sir, ſtudied him, and knew him well: you venerated and admired him. Yet, luminous as he was upon the whole, you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the ſhades which mingled in the grand compoſition, all the little peculiarities and ſlight ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes which marked the literary Coloſſus. Your very warm commendation of the ſpecimen which I gave in my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> of my being able to preſerve his converſation in an authentick and lively manner, which opinion the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0548300101:6"/>
Publick has confirmed, was the beſt encouragement for me to perſevere in my purpoſe of producing the whole of my ſtores.</p>
            <p>In one reſpect this work will in ſome paſſages be different from the former. In my <q rend="inline">"Tour"</q> I was almoſt unboundedly open in my communications; and from my eagerneſs to diſplay the wonderful fertility and readineſs of Johnſon's wit, freely ſhewed to the world its dexterity, even when I was myſelf the object of it. I truſted that I ſhould be liberally underſtood, as knowing very well what I was about, and by no means as ſimply unconſcious of the pointed effects of the ſatire. I own, indeed, that I was arrogant enough to ſuppoſe that the tenor of the reſt of the book would ſufficiently guard me againſt ſuch a ſtrange imputation. But it ſeems I judged too well of the world; for, though I could ſcarcely believe it, I have been undoubtedly informed, that many perſons, eſpecially in diſtant quarters, not penetrating enough into Johnſon's character ſo as to underſtand his mode of treating his friends, have arraigned my judgement, inſtead of ſeeing that I was ſenſible of all that they could obſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0548300101:7"/>
It is related of the great Dr. Clarke, that when in one of his leiſure hours he was unbending himſelf with a few friends in the moſt playful and frolickſome manner, he obſerved Beau Naſh approaching; upon which he ſuddenly ſtopped:—<q rend="inline">"My boys, (ſaid he,) let us be grave: here comes a fool."</q> The world, my friend, I have found to be a great fool, as to that particular, on which it has become neceſſary to ſpeak very plainly. I have, therefore, in this work been more reſerved; and though I tell nothing but the truth, I have ſtill kept in my mind that the whole truth is not always to be expoſed. This, however, I have managed ſo as to occaſion no diminution of the pleaſure which my book ſhould afford; though malignity may ſometimes be diſappointed of its gratifications.</p>
            <closer>I am, <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>

            <p>I At laſt deliver to the world a Work which I have long promiſed, and of which, I am afraid, too high expectations have been raiſed. The delay of its publication muſt be imputed, in a conſiderable degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the extraordinary zeal which has been ſhewn by diſtinguiſhed perſons in all quarters to ſupply me with additional information concerning its illuſtrious Subject; reſembling in this the grateful tribes of ancient nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which every individual was eager to throw a ſtone upon the grave of a departed Hero, and thus to ſhare in the pious office of erecting an honourable monument to his memory.</p>
            <p>The labour and anxious attention with which I have collected and arranged the materials of which theſe volumes are compoſed, will hardly be conceived by thoſe who read them with careleſs facility. The ſtretch of mind and prompt aſſiduity by which ſo many converſations were preſerved, I myſelf, at ſome diſtance of time, contemplate with wonder; and I muſt be allowed to ſuggeſt, that the nature of the work in other reſpects, as it conſiſts of innumerable detached particulars, all which, even the moſt minute, I have ſpared no pains to aſcertain with a
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0548300101:9"/>
ſcrupulous authenticity, has occaſioned a degree of trouble far beyond that of any other ſpecies of compoſition. Were I to detail the books which I have conſulted, and the inquiries which I have found it neceſſary to make by various channels, I ſhould probably be thought ridiculouſly oſtentatious. Let me only obſerve, as a ſpecimen of my trouble, that I have ſometimes had to run half over London, in order to fix a date correctly; which, when I had accompliſhed, I well knew would obtain me no praiſe, though a failure would have been to my diſcredit. And after all perhaps, hard as it may be, I ſhall not be ſurprized if omiſſions or miſtakes be pointed out with invidious ſeverity. I have alſo been extremely careful as to the exactneſs of my quotations; holding that there is a reſpect due to the Publick which ſhould oblige every Author to attend to this, and never to preſume to introduce them with—<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>"I think I have read;"</hi>
               </q>—or,—<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>"If I remember right;"</hi>
               </q>—when the originals may be examined.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to expreſs my warmeſt thanks to thoſe who have been pleaſed to favour me with communications and advice in the conduct of my Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I cannot ſufficiently acknowledge my obligations to my friend Mr. Malone, who was ſo good as to allow me to read to him almoſt the whole of my manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, and made ſuch remarks as were greatly for the advantage of the Work; though it is but fair to him to mention, that upon many occaſions I differed from him, and followed my own judgement. I regret exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly that I was deprived of the benefit of his reviſion, when but about one half of the book had paſſed through the preſs; but after having completed his very laborious and admirable edition of Shakſpeare, for
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0548300101:10"/>
which he generouſly would accept of no other reward but that fame which he has ſo deſervedly obtained, he fulfilled his promiſe of a long-wiſhed-for viſit to his relations in Ireland; from whence his ſafe return <hi>finibus Atticis</hi> is deſired by his friends here, with all the claſſical ardour of <hi>Sic te Diva potens Cypri;</hi> for there is no man in whom more elegant and worthy qualities are united; and whoſe ſociety therefore is more valued by thoſe who know him.</p>
            <p>It is painful to me to think, that while I was carrying on this Work, ſeveral of thoſe to whom it would have been moſt intereſting have died. Such melancholy diſappointments we know to be incident to humanity; but we do not feel them the leſs. Let me particularly lament the Reverend Thomas Warton, and the Reverend Dr. Adams. Mr. Warton, amidſt his variety of genius and learning, was an excellent Biographer. His contributions to my Collection are highly eſtimable; and as he had a true reliſh of my <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>"Tour to the Hebrides,"</hi>
               </q> I truſt I ſhould now have been gratified with a larger ſhare of his kind approbation. Dr. Adams, eminent as the Head of a College, as a writer, and as a moſt amiable man, had known Johnſon from his early years, and was his friend through life. What reaſon I had to hope for the countenance of that venerable Gentleman to this Work, will appear from what he wrote to me upon a former occaſion from Oxford, November <hi>17, 1785:—</hi>
               <q rend="inline">"Dear Sir, I hazard this letter, not knowing where it will find you, to thank you for your very agreeable 'Tour, which I found here on my return from the country, and in which you have depicted our friend ſo perfectly to my fancy, in every attitude, every ſcene and ſituation, that I have thought myſelf in the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0548300101:11"/>
company, and of the party almoſt throughout. It has given very general ſatisfaction; and thoſe who have found moſt fault with a paſſage here and there, have agreed that they could not help going through, and being entertained through the whole. I wiſh, indeed, ſome few groſs expreſſions had been ſoftened, and a few of our hero's foibles had been a little more ſhaded; but it is uſeful to ſee the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes incident to great minds; and you have given us Dr. Johnſon's authority that in hiſtory all ought to be told."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such a ſanction to my faculty of giving a juſt repreſentation of Dr. Johnſon I could not conceal. Nor will I ſuppreſs my ſatisfaction in the conſciouſneſs, that by recording ſo conſiderable a portion of the wiſdom and wit of <q rend="inline">

            <head>THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.</head>
            <p>TO write the life of him who excelled all mankind in writing the lives of others, and who, whether we conſider his extraordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or his various works, has been equalled by few in any age, is an arduous, and may be reckoned in me a preſumptuous taſk.</p>
            <p>Had Dr. Johnſon written his own life, in conformity with the opinion which he has given <note n="1" place="bottom">Idler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No. 84.</note>, that every man's life may be beſt written by himſelf; had he employed in the preſervation of his own hiſtory, that clearneſs of narration and elegance of language in which he has embalmed ſo many eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the world would probably have had the moſt perfect example of biography that was ever exhibited. But although he at different times, in a deſultory manner, committed to writing many particulars of the progreſs of his mind and fortunes, he never had perſevering diligence enough to form them into a regular compoſition. Of theſe memorials a few have been preſerved; but the greater part was conſigned by him to the flames, a few days before his death.</p>
            <p>As I had the honour and happineſs of enjoying his friendſhip for upwards of twenty years; as I had the ſcheme of writing his life conſtantly in view; as he was well appriſed of this circumſtance, and from time to time obligingly ſatisfied my inquiries, by communicating to me the incidents of his early years; as I acquired a facility in recollecting, and was very aſſiduous in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0548300101:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
recording his converſation, of which the extraordinary vigour and vivacity conſtituted one of the firſt features of his character; and as I have ſpared no pains in obtaining materials concerning him, from every quarter where I could diſcover that they were to be found, and have been favoured with the moſt liberal communications by his friends; I flatter myſelf that few biographers have entered upon ſuch a work as this, with more advantages, independent of literary abilities, in which I am not vain enough to compare myſelf with ſome great names who have gone before me in this kind of writing.</p>
            <p>Since my work was announced, ſeveral Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnſon have been publiſhed, the moſt voluminous of which is one compiled for the Bookſellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight <note n="2" place="bottom">The greateſt part of this book was written while Sir John Hawkins was alive; and I avow, that one object of my ſtrictures was to make him feel ſome compunction for his illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral treatment of Dr. Johnſon. Since his deceaſe, I have ſuppreſſed ſeveral of my remarks upon his work. But though I would not <q rend="inline">"war with the dead"</q> 
                  <hi>offenſively,</hi> I think it neceſſary to be ſtrenuous in <hi>defence</hi> of my illuſtrious friend, which I cannot be, without ſtrong animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon a writer who has greatly injured him, Let me add, that though I doubt I ſhould not have been very prompt to gratify Sir John Hawkins with any compliment in his life-time, I do now frankly acknowledge, that, in my opinion, his volume, however inadequate and improper as a life of Dr. Johnſon, and however diſcredited by unpardonable inaccuracies in other reſpects, contains a collection of curious anecdotes and obſervations, which few men but its authour could have brought together.</note>, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnſon, I never ſaw in his company, I think but once, and I am ſure not above twice. Johnſon might have eſteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary hiſtory; but from the rigid formality of his manners, it is evident that they never could have lived together with companionable eaſe and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was neceſſary to mark the finer and leſs obvious parts of Johnſon's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking poſſeſſion of ſuch fragments of a diary and other papers as were left, of which, before deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to the reſiduary legatee, whoſe property they were, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extract the ſubſtance. In this he has not been very ſucceſsful, as I have found upon a peruſal of thoſe papers, which have been ſince transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I muſt acknowledge, exhibit a <hi>farrago,</hi> of which a conſiderable portion is not devoid of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the lovers of literary goſſiping; but beſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

with long unneceſſary extracts from various works, (even one of ſeveral leaves from Oſborne's Harleian Catalogue, and thoſe not compiled by Johnſon, but by Oldys) a very ſmall part of it relates to the perſon who is the ſubject of the book; and, in that, there is ſuch an inaccuracy in the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of facts, as in ſo ſolemn an authour is hardly excuſable, and certainly makes his narrative very unſatisfactory. But what is ſtill worſe, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable caſt, by which the moſt unfavourable conſtruction is put upon almoſt every circumſtance in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and conduct of my illuſtrious friend; who, I truſt, will, by a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious miſrepreſentations of this authour, and from the ſlighter aſperſions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him.</p>
            <p>There is, in the Britiſh Muſeum, a letter from Biſhop Warburton to Dr. Birch, on the ſubject of biography; which, though I am aware it may expoſe me to a charge of artfully raiſing the value of my own work, by contraſting it with that of which I have ſpoken, is ſo well conceived and expreſſed, that I cannot refrain from here inſerting it:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>I SHALL endeavour (ſays Dr. Warburton) to give you what ſatisfaction I can in any thing you want to be ſatisfied in any ſubject of Milton, and am extremely glad you intend to write his life. Almoſt all the life-writers we have had before Toland and Deſmaiſeaux, are indeed ſtrange inſipid creatures; and yet I had rather read the worſt of them, than be obliged to go through with this of Milton's, or the other's life of Boileau, where there is ſuch a dull, heavy ſucceſſion of long quotations of diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages, that it makes their method quite nauſeous. But the verboſe, taſteleſs Frenchman ſeems to lay it down as a principle, that every life muſt be a book, and what's worſe, it proves a book without a life; for what do we know of Boileau, after all his tedious ſtuff? You are the only one, (and I ſpeak it without a compliment) that by the vigour of your ſtile and ſentiments, and the real importance of your materials, have the art (which one would imagine no one could have miſſed) of adding agreements to the moſt agreeable ſubject in the world, which is literary hiſtory <note n="3" place="bottom">Brit.

in the execution of the work, I have reſolved to adopt and enlarge upon the excellent plan of Mr. Maſon, in his Memoirs of Gray. Wherever narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is neceſſary to explain, connect, and ſupply, I furniſh it to the beſt of my abilities; but in the chronological ſeries of Johnſon's life, which I trace as diſtinctly as I can, year by year, I produce, wherever it is in my power, his own minutes, letters, or converſation, being convinced that this mode is more lively, and will make my readers better acquainted with him, than even moſt of thoſe were who actually knew him, but could know him only partially; whereas there is here an accumulation of intelligence from various points, by which his character is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore fully underſtood and illuſtrated.</p>
            <p>Indeed I cannot conceive a more perfect mode of writing any man's life, than not only relating all the moſt important events of it in their order, but interweaving what he privately wrote, and ſaid, and thought; by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are enabled as it were to ſee him live, and to <q rend="inline">"live o'er each ſcene"</q> with him, as he actually advanced through the ſeveral ſtages of his life. Had his other friends been as diligent and ardent as I was, he might have been almoſt entirely preſerved. As it is, I will venture to ſay that he will be ſeen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived.</p>
            <p>And he will be ſeen as he really was; for I profeſs to write, not his pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick, which muſt be all praiſe, but his life; which, great and good as he was, muſt not be ſuppoſed to be entirely perfect. To be as he was, is indeed ſubject of panegyrick enough to any man in this ſtate of being; but in every picture there ſhould be ſhade as well as light, and when I delineate him without reſerve, I do what he himſelf recommended, both by his precept and his example:</p>

               <q rend="inline">"If the biographer writes from perſonal knowledge, and makes haſte to gratify the publick curioſity, there is danger leſt his intereſt, his fear, his gratitude, or his tenderneſs overpower his fidelity, and tempt him to conceal, if not to invent.

What I conſider as the peculiar value of the following work, is, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity that it contains of Johnſon's converſation; which is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been eminently inſtructive and entertaining; and of which the ſpecimens that I have given upon a former occaſion, have been received with ſo much approbation, that I have good grounds for ſuppoſing that the world will not be indifferent to more ample communications of a ſimilar nature.</p>
            <p>That the converſation of a celebrated man, if his talents have been exerted in converſation, will beſt diſplay his character, is, I truſt, too well eſtabliſhed in the judgement of mankind, to be at all ſhaken by a ſneering obſervation of Mr. Maſon, in his Memoirs of Mr. William Whitehead, in which there is literally no <hi>Life,</hi> but a mere dry narrative of facts. I do not think it was quite neceſſary to attempt a depreciation of what is univerſally eſteemed, becauſe it was not to be found in the immediate object of the ingenious writer's pen; for in truth, from a man ſo ſtill and ſo tame, as to be contented to paſs many years as the domeſtick companion of a ſuperannuated lord and lady, converſation worth recording could no more be expected, than from a Chineſe mandarin on a chimney-piece, or the fantaſtick figures on a gilt leather ſkreen.</p>
            <p>If authority be required, let us appeal to Plutarch, the prince of ancient biographers. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <q rend="inline">"Nor is it always in the moſt diſtinguiſhed atchievements that men's virtues or vices may be beſt diſcerned; but very often an action of ſmall note, a ſhort ſaying, or a jeſt, ſhall diſtinguiſh a perſon's real character more than the greateſt ſieges, or the moſt important battles <note n="5" place="bottom">Plutarch's Life of Alexander.—Langhorne's Tranſlation.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this may be added the ſentiments of the very man whoſe life I am am about to exhibit. <q rend="inline">"The buſineſs of the biographer is often to paſs ſlightly over thoſe performances and incidents which produce vulgar great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to lead the thoughts into domeſtick privacies, and diſplay the minute details of daily life, where exterior appendages are caſt aſide, and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue. The account of Thuanus is with great propriety ſaid by its authour to have been written, that it might lay open to poſterity the private and familiar character of that man, <hi>cujus ingenium et candorem ex ipſius ſcriptis ſunt olim ſemper miraturi,</hi> whoſe candour and genius will to the end of time be by his writings preſerved in admiration.</q>

               <p>There are many inviſible circumſtances, which whether we read as enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers after natural or moral knowledge, whether we intend to enlarge our ſcience, or increaſe our virtue, are more important than publick occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Thus Salluſt, the great maſter of nature, has not forgot in his account of Catiline to remark, that his walk was now quick, and again ſlow, as an indication of a mind revolving with violent commotion. Thus the ſtory of Melancthon affords a ſtriking lecture on the value of time, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us, that when he had made an appointment, he expected not only the hour, but the minute to be fixed, that the day might not run out in the idleneſs of ſuſpence; and all the plans and enterprizes of De Wit are now of leſs importance to the world than that part of his perſonal character, which repreſents him as careful of his health, and negligent of his life.</p>
               <p>But biography has often been allotted to writers, who ſeem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very little acquainted with the nature of their taſk, or very negligent about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. They rarely afford any other account than might be collected from publick papers, but imagine themſelves writing a life, when they exhibit a chronological ſeries of actions or preferments; and have ſo little regard to the manners or behaviour of their heroes, that more knowledge may be gained of a man's real character, by a ſhort converſation with one of his ſervants, than from a formal and ſtudied narrative, begun with his pedigree, and ended with his funeral.</p>
               <p>There are, indeed, ſome natural reaſons why theſe narratives are often written by ſuch as were not likely to give much inſtruction or delight, and why moſt accounts of particular perſons are barren and uſeleſs. If a life be delayed till intereſt and envy are at an end, we may hope for impartiality, but muſt expect little intelligence; for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evaneſcent kind, ſuch as ſoon eſcape the memory, and are tranſmitted by tradition. We know how few can pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a living acquaintance, except by his moſt prominent and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable particularities, and the groſſer features of his mind; and it may be eaſily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be loſt in impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and how ſoon a ſucceſſion of copies will loſe all reſemblance of the original <note n="6" place="bottom">Rambler, No. 60.</note>.</p>

            <p>I am fully aware of the objections which may be made to the minuteneſs on ſome occaſions of my detail of Johnſon's converſation, and how happily it is

adapted for the petty exerciſe of ridicule by men of ſuperficial underſtanding, and ludicrous fancy; but I remain firm and confident in my opinion, that minute particulars are frequently characteriſtick, and always amuſing, when they relate to a diſtinguiſhed man. I am therefore exceedingly unwilling that almoſt any thing which my illuſtrious friend thought it worth his while to expreſs, with any degree of point, ſhould periſh. For this almoſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious reverence, I have found very old and venerable authority, quoted by our great modern prelate, Secker, in whoſe tenth ſermon there is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage:</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>"Rabbi David Kimchi,</hi> a noted Jewiſh commentator who lived above five hundred years ago, explains that paſſage in the firſt Pſalm, <hi>His leaf alſo ſhall not wither,</hi> from Rabbins yet older than himſelf, thus: That <hi>even the idle talk,</hi> ſo he expreſſes it, <hi>of a good man ought to be regarded;</hi> the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things he ſaith are always of ſome value. And other ancient authours have the ſame phraſe, nearly in the ſame ſenſe."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of one thing I am certain, that conſidering how highly the ſmall portion which we have of the table-talk and other anecdotes of our celebrated writers is valued, and how earneſtly it is regretted that we have not more, I am juſtified in preſerving rather too many of Johnſon's ſayings than too few; eſpecially as from the diverſity of diſpoſitions it cannot be known with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty beforehand, whether what may ſeem trifling to ſome, and perhaps to the collector himſelf, may not be moſt agreeable to many; and the greater number that an authour can pleaſe in any degree, the more pleaſure does there ariſe to a benevolent mind.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who are weak enough to think this a degrading taſk, and the time and labour which have been devoted to it miſemployed, I ſhall content myſelf with oppoſing the authority of the greateſt man of any age, JULIUS CAESAR, of whom Bacon obſerves, that <q rend="inline">"in his book of Apothegms which he collected, we ſee that he eſteemed it more honour to make himſelf but a pair of tables, to take the wiſe and pithy words of others, than to have every word of his own to be made an apothegm or an oracle <note n="7" place="bottom">Bacon's Advancement of Learning, Book I.</note>."</q>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1709"/> SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Lichfield, in Staffordſhire, on the 18th of September, N. S. 1709; and his initiation into the Chriſtian church was not delayed; for his baptiſm is recorded, in the regiſter of St. Mary's pariſh in that city, to have been performed on the day of his birth: His father is there ſtiled <hi>Gentleman,</hi> a circumſtance of which an ignorant panegyriſt has praiſed him for not being proud; when the truth is, that the appellation of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though now loſt in the indiſcriminate aſſumption of <hi>Eſquire,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken by thoſe who could not boaſt of gentility. His father was Michael Johnſon, a native of Derbyſhire, of obſcure extraction, who ſettled in Lichfield as a bookſeller and ſtationer. His mother was Sarah Ford, deſcended of an ancient race of ſubſtantial yeomanry in Warwickſhire. They were well advanced in years when they married, and never had more than two children, both ſons; Samuel, their firſt born, who lived to be the illuſtrious character whoſe various excellence I am to endeavour to record, and Nathanael, who died in his twenty-fifth year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Michael Johnſon was a man of a large and robuſt body, and of a ſtrong and active mind; yet, as in the moſt ſolid rocks veins of unſound ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are often diſcovered, there was in him a mixture of that diſeaſe, the nature of which eludes the moſt minute enquiry, though the effects are well known to be a wearineſs of life, an unconcern about thoſe things which agitate the greater part of mankind, and a general ſenſation of gloomy wretchedneſs. From him then his ſon inherited, with ſome other qualities, <q rend="inline">"a vile melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,"</q> which in his too ſtrong expreſſion of any diſturbance of the mind, <q rend="inline">"made him mad all his life, at leaſt not ſober. <note n="8" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 213.</note>"</q> Michael was, however, forced by the narrowneſs of his circumſtances to be very diligent in buſineſs, not only in his ſhop, but by occaſionally reſorting to ſeveral towns in the neighbourhood, ſome of which were at a conſiderable diſtance from Lichfield. At that time bookſellers' ſhops in the provincial towns of England were very rare, ſo that there was not one even in Birmingham, in which town old Mr. Johnſon uſed to open a ſhop every market-day. He was a pretty good Latin ſcholar, and a citizen ſo creditable as to be made one of the magiſtrates of Lichfield; and, being a man of good ſenſe, and ſkill in his trade, he acquired a reaſonable ſhare of wealth, of which however he afterwards loſt the greateſt part, by engaging unſucceſsfully in a manufacture of parchment. He was a zealous high-churchman and royaliſt, and retained his attachment to the unfortunate houſe of Stuart, though he reconciled himſelf, by caſuiſtical arguments of expediency and neceſſity, to take the oaths impoſed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing power.</p>

There is a circumſtance in his life ſomewhat romantick, but ſo well authenticated, that I ſhall not omit it. A young woman of Leek, in Staffordſhire, while he ſerved his apprenticeſhip there, conceived a violent paſſion for him; and though it met with no favourable return, followed him to Lichfield, where ſhe took lodgings oppoſite to the houſe in which he lived, and indulged her hopeleſs flame. When he was informed that it ſo preyed upon her mind that her life was in danger, he with a generous humanity went to her and offered to marry her, but it was then too late: Her vital power was exhauſted; and ſhe actually exhibited one of the very rare inſtances of dying for love. She was buried in the cathedral of Lichfield; and he, with a tender regard, placed a ſtone over her grave with this inſcription:</p>

                  <p>Here lies the body of Mrs. ELIZABETH BLANEY, a ſtranger.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Johnſon's mother was a woman of diſtinguiſhed underſtanding. I aſked his old ſchool-fellow Mr. Hector, ſurgeon, of Birmingham, if ſhe was not vain of her ſon. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"ſhe had too much good ſenſe to be vain, but ſhe knew her ſon's value."</q> Her piety was not inferiour to her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to her muſt be aſcribed thoſe early impreſſions of religion upon the mind of her ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which the world afterwards derived ſo much benefit. He told me, that he remembered diſtinctly having had the firſt notice of Heaven <q rend="inline">"a place to which good people went,"</q> and Hell <q rend="inline">"a place to which bad people went,"</q> communicated to him by her, when a little child in bed with her; and that it might be the better fixed in his memory, ſhe ſent him to repeat it to Thomas Jackſon, their man-ſervant. He not being in the way, this was not done; but there was no occaſion for any artificial aid for its preſervation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In all ſuch inveſtigations it is certainly unwiſe to pay too much attention to incidents which the credulous relate with eager ſatisfaction, and the more ſcrupulous or witty enquirer conſiders only as topicks of ridicule: Yet there is a traditional ſtory of the infant Hercules of toryiſm, ſo curiouſly charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtick, that I ſhall not withold it. It was communicated to me in a letter from Miſs Mary Adye, of Lichfield.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"When Dr. Sacheverel was at Lichfield, Johnſon was not quite three years old. My grandfather Hammond obſerved him at the cathedral perched upon his father's ſhoulders, liſtening, and gaping at the much celebrated preacher. Mr. Hammond aſked Mr. Johnſon how he could poſſibly think of bringing ſuch an infant to church, and in the midſt of ſo great a croud. He anſwered, becauſe it was impoſſible to keep him at home; for, young as he was, he believed he had caught the publick ſpirit and zeal for Sacheverel, and would have ſtaid for ever in the church, ſatisfied with beholding him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I omit a little inſtance of that jealous independence of ſpirit, and impetuoſity of temper, which never forſook him. The fact was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to me by himſelf, upon the authority of his mother. One day, when the ſervant who uſed to be ſent to ſchool to conduct him home, had not come in time, he ſet out by himſelf, though he was then ſo near-ſighted, that he was obliged to ſtoop down on his hands and knees to take a view of the kennel before he ventured to ſtep over it. His ſchoolmiſtreſs, afraid that he might miſs his way, or fall into the kennel, or be run over by a cart, followed him at ſome diſtance. He happened to turn about and perceive her. Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her careful attention as an inſult to his manlineſs, he ran back to her in a rage, and beat her, as well as his ſtrength would permit.</p>
               <p>Of the ſtrength of his memory, for which he was all his life eminent to a degree almoſt incredible, the following early inſtance was told me in his preſence at Lichfield, in 1776, by his ſtep-daughter, Mrs. Lucy Porter, as related to her by his mother. When he was a child in petticoats, and had learnt to read, Mrs. Johnſon one morning put the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed to the collect for the day, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sam, you muſt get this by heart."</q> She went up ſtairs, leaving him to ſtudy it: But by the time ſhe had reached the ſecond floor, ſhe heard him following her. <q rend="inline">"What's the matter?"</q> ſaid ſhe. <q rend="inline">"I can ſay it,"</q> he replied; and repeated it diſtinctly, though he could not have read it over more than twice.</p>

But there has been another ſtory of his infant precocity generally circulated, and generally believed, the truth of which I am to refute upon his own authority. It is told <note n="9" place="bottom">Anecdotes of Dr. Johnſon by Heſter Lynch Piozzi, p. 11.—Life of Dr. Johnſon by Sir John Hawkins. p. 6.</note>, that, when a child of three years old, he chanced to tread upon a duckling, the eleventh of a brood, and killed it; upon which, it is ſaid, he dictated to his mother the following epitaph:</p>
               <q>

                     <l>"Here lies good maſter duck,</l>

               <p>There is ſurely internal evidence that this little compoſition combines in it, what no child of three years old could produce, without an extenſion of its faculties by immediate inſpiration; yet Mrs. Lucy Porter, Dr. Johnſon's ſtep-daughter, poſitively maintained to me, in his preſence, that there could be no doubt of the truth of this anecdote, for ſhe had heard it from his mother. So difficult is it to obtain an authentick relation of facts, and ſuch authority may there be for errour; for he aſſured me, that his father made the verſes, and wiſhed to paſs them for his child's.

                     <note n="2" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 27.</note>,"</q> which aſcertains a defect that many of his friends knew he had, though I never perceived it. I ſuppoſed him to be only near-ſighted; and indeed I muſt obſerve, that in no other reſpect could I diſcern any defect in his viſion; on the contrary, the force of his attention and perceptive quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made him ſee and diſtinguiſh all manner of objects, whether of nature or of art, with a nicety that is rarely to be found. When he and I were travelling in the Highlands of Scotland, and I pointed out to him a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which I obſerved reſembled a cone, he corrected my inaccuracy by ſhewing me, that it was indeed pointed at the top, but that one ſide of it was larger than the other. And the ladies with whom he was acquainted agree, that no man was more nicely and minutely critical in the elegance of female dreſs. When I found that he ſaw the romantick beauties of Iſlam, in Derbyſhire, much better than I did, I told him that he reſembled an able performer upon a bad inſtrument. How falſe and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible then are all the remarks which have been made to the prejudice either of his candour or of his philoſophy, founded upon a ſuppoſition that he was almoſt blind. It has been ſaid, that he contracted this grievous malady from his nurſe. His mother yielding to the ſuperſtitious notion, which, it is wonderful to think, prevailed ſo long in this country, as to the virtue of the regal touch; a notion, which our kings encouraged, and to which a man of ſuch inquiry and ſuch judgement as Carte could give credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carried him to London, where he was actually touched by Queen Anne. Mrs. Johnſon indeed, as Mr. Hector informed me, acted by the advice of the celebrated Sir John Floyer, then a phyſician in Lichfield. Johnſon uſed to talk of this very frankly; and Mrs. Piozzi has preſerved his very pictureſque deſcription of the ſcene, as it remained upon his fancy. Being aſked if he could remember Queen Anne, <q rend="inline">"He had (he ſaid) a confuſed, but ſomehow a ſort of ſolemn recollection of a lady in diamonds, and a long black hood <note n="3" place="bottom">Anecdotes, p. 10.</note>."</q> This touch, however, was without any effect. I ventured to ſay to him, in alluſion to the political principles in which he was educated, and of which he ever retained ſome odour, that <q rend="inline">"his mother had not carried him far enough; ſhe ſhould have taken him to ROME."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was firſt taught to read Engliſh by Dame Oliver, a widow, who kept a ſchool for young children in Lichfield. He told me ſhe could read the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0548300101:40"/>
black letter, and aſked him to borrow for her, from his father, a bible in that character. When he was going to Oxford, ſhe came to take leave of him, brought him, in the ſimplicity of her kindneſs, a preſent of ginger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, and ſaid he was the beſt ſcholar ſhe had ever had. He delighted in mentioning this early compliment; adding, with a ſmile, that <q rend="inline">"this was as high a proof of his merit as he could conceive."</q> His next inſtructor in Engliſh was a maſter, whom, when he ſpoke of him to me, he fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly called Tom Brown, who, ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"publiſhed a ſpelling-book, and dedicated it to the UNIVERSE;—but, I fear, no copy of it can now be had."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He began to learn Latin with Mr. Hawkins, uſher, or under-maſter of Lichfield ſchool, <q rend="inline">"a man (ſaid he) very ſkilful in his little way."</q> With him he continued two years, and then roſe to be under the care of Mr. Hunter the head-maſter, who, according to his account, <q rend="inline">"was very ſevere, and wrong-headedly ſevere. He uſed (ſaid he) to beat us unmercifully; and he did not diſtinguiſh between ignorance and negligence; for he would beat a boy equally for not knowing a thing, as for neglecting to know it. He would aſk a boy a queſtion; and if he did not anſwer it, he would beat him, without conſidering whether he had an opportunity of knowing how to anſwer it. For inſtance, he would call up a boy and aſk him Latin for a candleſtick, which the boy could not expect to be aſked. Now, Sir, if a boy could anſwer every queſtion, there would be no need of a maſter to teach him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is, however, but juſtice to the memory of Mr. Hunter to mention, that though he might err in being too ſevere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſchool of Lichfield was very reſpectable in his time. The late Dr. Taylor, Prebendary of Weſtminſter, who was educated under him, told me, that he was an excellent maſter, and that his uſhers were moſt of them men of eminence; that Holbrook, one of the moſt ingenious men, beſt ſcholars, and beſt preachers of hiſ age, was uſher during the greateſt part of the time that Johnſon was at ſchool. Then came Hague, of whom as much might be ſaid, with the addition that he was an elegant poet. Hague was ſucceeded by Green, afterwards Biſhop of Lincoln, whoſe character in the learned world is well known. In the ſame form with Johnſon was Congreve, who afterwards became chaplain to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, and by that connection obtained good preferment in Ireland. He was a younger ſon of the ancient family of Congreve, in Staſſordſhire, of which the poet was a branch. His brother ſold the eſtate. There was alſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0548300101:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lowe, afterwards Canon of Windſor; who was tutor to the preſent Marquis Townſhend, and his brother Charles.</p>
               <p>Indeed Johnſon was very ſenſible how much he owed to Mr. Hunter. Mr. Langton one day aſked him how he had acquired ſo accurate a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Latin, in which, I believe, he was exceeded by no man of his time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My maſter whipt me very well. Without that, Sir, I ſhould have done nothing."</q> He told Mr. Langton, that while Hunter was flogging his boys unmercifully, he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"And this I do to ſave you from the gallows."</q> Johnſon, upon all occaſions, expreſſed his approbation of enforcing inſtruction by means of the rod. <q rend="inline">"I would rather (ſaid he) have the rod to be the general terrour to all, to make them learn, than tell a child, if you do thus, or thus, you will be more eſteemed than your brothers or ſiſters. The rod produces an effect which terminates in itſelf. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his taſk, and there's an end on't; whereas, by exciting emulation and compariſons of ſuperiority, you lay the foundation of laſting miſchief; you make brothers and ſiſters hate each other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Langton told me, that when Johnſon ſaw ſome young ladies in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire who were remarkably well behaved, owing to their mother's ſtrict diſcipline and ſevere correction, he exclaimed, in one of Shakſpeare's lines a little varied, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Rod,</hi> I will honour thee for this thy duty."</q>
               </p>
               <p>That ſuperiority over his fellows, which he maintained with ſo much dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in his march through life, was not aſſumed from vanity and oſtentation, but was the natural and conſtant effect of thoſe extraordinary powers of mind, of which he could not but be conſcious by compariſon; the intellectual difference, which in other caſes of compariſon of characters is often a matter of undecided conteſt, being as clear in his caſe as the ſuperiority of ſtature in ſome men above others. Johnſon did not ſtrut or ſtand on tip-toe: He only did not ſtoop. From his earlieſt years, his ſuperiority was perceived and acknowledged. He was from the beginning <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a king of men. His ſchoolfellow, Mr. Hector, has obligingly furniſhed me with many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his boyiſh days; and aſſured me, that he never knew him corrected at ſchool, but for talking and diverting other boys from their buſineſs. He ſeemed to learn by intuition; for though indolence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination were inherent in his conſtitution, whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one elſe. In ſhort, he is a memorable inſtance of what has been often obſerved, that the boy is the man in miniature; and that the diſtinguiſhing characteriſticks of each individual are the ſame, through the whole courſe of life. His favourites uſed to receive very liberal aſſiſtance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0548300101:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from him; and ſuch was the ſubmiſſion and deference with which he was treated, ſuch the deſire to obtain his regard, that three of the boys, of whom Mr. Hector was ſometimes one, uſed to come in the morning as his humble attendants, and carry him to ſchool. One in the middle ſtooped, while he ſat upon his back, and one on each ſide ſupported him; and thus he was borne triumphant. Such a proof of the early predominance of intellectual vigour is very remarkable, and does honour to human nature. Talking to me once himſelf of his being much diſtinguiſhed at ſchool, he told me, <q rend="inline">"they never thought to raiſe me by comparing me to any one; they never ſaid, Johnſon is as good a ſcholar as ſuch a one; but ſuch a one is as good a ſcholar as Johnſon; and this was ſaid but of one, but of Lowe; and I do not think he was as good a ſcholar."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He diſcovered a great ambition to excel, which rouſed him to counteract his indolence. He was uncommonly inquiſitive; and his memory was ſo tenacious, that he never forgot any thing that he either heard or read. Mr. Hector remembers having recited to him eighteen verſes, which, after a little pauſe, he repeated <hi>verbatim,</hi> varying only one epithet, by which he improved the line.</p>
               <p>He never joined with the other boys in their ordinary diverſions; his only amuſement was in winter, when he took a pleaſure in being drawn upon the ice by a boy barefooted, who pulled him along by a garter fixed round him; no very eaſy operation, as his ſize was remarkably large. His defective ſight, indeed, prevented him from enjoying the common ſports; and he once pleaſantly remarked to me, how wonderfully well he had contrived to be idle without them. Lord Cheſterfield, however, has juſtly obſerved in one of his letters, when earneſtly cautioning a friend againſt the pernicious effects of idleneſs, that active ſports are not to be reckoned idleneſs in young people; and that the liſtleſs torpor of doing nothing, alone deſerves that name. Of this diſmal inertneſs of diſpoſition, Johnſon had all his life too great a ſhare. Mr. Hector relates, that <q rend="inline">"he could not oblige him more than by ſauntering away the hours of vacation in the fields, during which he was more engaged in talking to himſelf than to his companion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Percy, the Biſhop of Dromore, who was long intimately acquainted with him, and has preſerved a few anecdotes concerning him, regretting that he was not a more diligent collector, informs me, that <q rend="inline">"when a boy he was immoderately fond of reading romances of chivalry, and he retained his fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them through life; ſo that (adds his Lordſhip) ſpending part of a ſummer at my parſonage-houſe in the country, he choſe for his regular read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

It has been ſaid, that he acted in the capacity of an aſſiſtant to Mr. Wentworth, in teaching the younger boys. <q rend="inline">"Mr. Wentworth (he told me) was a very able man, but an idle man, and to me very ſevere; but I cannot blame him much. I was then a big boy; he ſaw I did not reverence him; and that he ſhould get no honour by me. I had brought enough with me, to carry me through; and all I ſhould get at his ſchool would be aſcribed to my own labour, or to my former maſter. Yet he taught me a great deal."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He thus diſcriminated, to Dr. Percy, Biſhop of Dromore, his progreſs at his two grammar-ſchools. <q rend="inline">"At one, I learnt much in the ſchool, but little from the maſter; in the other, I learnt much from the maſter, but little in the ſchool."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop alſo informs me, that <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon's father, before he was received at Stourbridge, applied to have him admitted as a ſcholar and aſſiſtant to the Reverend Samuel Lea, M. A. head maſter of Newport ſchool, in Shropſhire, (a very diligent good teacher, at that time in high reputation, under whom Mr. Hollis is ſaid, in the Memoirs of his Life, to have been alſo educated <note n="5" place="bottom">As was likewiſe the Biſhop of Dromore many years afterwards.</note>).</q> This application to Mr. Lea was not ſucceſsful; but Johnſon had afterwards the gratification to hear that the old gentleman, who lived to a very advanced age, mentioned it as one of the moſt memorable events of his life, that <q rend="inline">"he was <hi>very near</hi> having that great man for his ſcholar."</q>
               </p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1728. Aetat. 19."/> The two years which he ſpent at home, after his return from Stourbridge, he paſſed in what he thought idleneſs, and was ſcolded by his father for his want of ſteady application. He had no ſettled plan of life, nor looked forward at all, but merely lived from day to day. Yet he read a great deal in a deſultory manner, without any ſcheme of ſtudy, as chance threw books in his way, and inclination directed him through them. He uſed to mention one curious inſtance of his caſual reading, when but a boy. Having imagined that his brother had hid ſome apples behind a large folio upon an upper ſhelf in his father's ſhop, he climbed up to ſearch for them. There were no apples; but the large folio proved to be Petrarch, whom he had ſeen mentioned, in ſome preface, as one of the reſtorers of learning. His curioſity having been thus excited, he ſat down with avidity, and read a great part of the book. What he read during theſe two years, he told me, was not works of mere amuſement, <q rend="inline">"not voyages and travels, but all literature, Sir, all ancient writers, all manly; though but little Greek, only ſome of Anacreon and Heſiod; but in this irregular manner (added he) I had looked into a great many books, which were not commonly known at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0548300101:53"/>
 where they ſeldom read any books but what are put into their hands by their tutors; ſo that when I came to Oxford, Dr. Adams, maſter of Pembroke College, told me, I was the beſt qualified for the Univerſity that he had ever known come there."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In eſtimating the progreſs of his mind during theſe two years, as well as in future periods of his life, we muſt not regard his own haſty confeſſion of idleneſs; for we ſee, when he explains himſelf, that he was acquiring various ſtores; and, indeed, he himſelf concluded the account, with ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I would not have you think I was doing nothing then."</q> He might, perhaps, have ſtudied more aſſiduouſly; but it may be doubted, whether ſuch a mind as his was not more enriched by roaming at large in the fields of literature, than if it had been confined to any ſingle ſpot. The analogy between body and mind is very general, and the parallel will hold as to their food, as well as any other particular. The fleſh of animals who feed excurſively, is allowed to have a higher flavour than that of thoſe who are cooped up. May there not be the ſame difference between men who read as their taſte prompts, and men who are confined in cells and colleges to ſtated taſks?</p>
               <p>That a man in Mr. Michael Johnſon's circumſtances ſhould think of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſon to the expenſive Univerſity of Oxford, at his own charge, ſeems very improbable. The ſubject was too delicate to queſtion Johnſon upon: But I have been aſſured by Dr. Taylor, that the ſcheme never would have taken place, had not a gentleman of Shropſhire, one of his ſchoolfellows, ſpontaneouſly undertaken to ſupport him at Oxford, in the character of his companion; though, in fact, he never received any aſſiſtance whatever from that gentleman.</p>
               <p>He, however, went to Oxford, and was entered a Commoner of Pembroke College, on the 31ſt of October, 1728, being then in his nineteenth year.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Dr. Adams, who afterwards preſided over Pembroke College with univerſal eſteem, told me he was preſent, and gave me ſome account of what paſſed on the night of Johnſon's arrival at Oxford. On that evening, his father, who had anxiouſly accompanied him, found means to have him introduced to Mr. Jorden, who was to be his tutor. His being put under any tutor, reminds us of what Wood ſays of Robert Burton, authour of the <q rend="inline">"Anatomy of Melancholy,"</q> when elected ſtudent of Chriſt Church; <q rend="inline">"for form's ſake, <hi>though he wanted not a tutor,</hi> he was put under the tuition of Dr. John Bancroft, afterwards Biſhop of Oxon <note n="9" place="bottom">Athen. Oxon. edit. 1721. p. 628.</note>."</q>

His father ſeemed very full of the merits of his ſon, and told the company he was a good ſcholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin verſes. His figure and manner appeared ſtrange to them; but he behaved modeſtly, and sat ſilent, till upon ſomething which occurred in the courſe of converſation, he ſuddenly ſtruck in and quoted Macrobius; and thus he gave the firſt impreſſion of that more extenſive reading in which he had indulged himſelf.</p>
               <p>His tutor, Mr. Jorden, fellow of Pembroke, was not, it ſeems, a man of ſuch abilities as we ſhould conceive requiſite for the inſtructor of Samuel Johnſon, who gave me the following account of him. <q rend="inline">"He was a very worthy man, but a heavy man, and I did not profit much by his inſtructions. Indeed, I did not attend him much. The firſt day after I came to college, I waited upon him, and then ſtaid away four. On the ſixth, Mr. Jorden aſked me why I had not attended. I anſwered, I had been ſliding in Chriſt-Church meadow. And this I ſaid with as much <hi>non-chalance</hi> as I am now<note n="1" place="bottom">Oxford, 20th March, 1776.</note> talking to you. I had no notion that I was wrong or irreverent to my tutor."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, was great fortitude of mind."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtark inſenſibility <note n="2" place="bottom">It ought to be remembered, that Dr. Johnſon was apt, in his literary as well as moral exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, to overcharge his defects. Dr. Adams informed me, that he attended his tutor's lectures, and alſo the lectures in the College Hall, very regularly.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth of November was at that time kept with great ſolemnity at Pembroke College, and exerciſes upon the ſubject of the day were required. Johnſon neglected to perform his, which is much to be regretted; for his vivacity of imagination, and force of language, would probably have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſomething ſublime upon the gunpowder plot. To apologiſe for his neglect, he gave in a ſhort copy of verſes, entitled <hi>Somnium,</hi> containing a common thought; <q rend="inline">"that the Muſe had come to him in his ſleep, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered that it did not become him to write on ſuch ſubjects as politicks; he ſhould confine himſelf to humbler themes:"</q> but the verſification was truly Virgilian.</p>
               <p>He had a love and reſpect for Jorden, not for his literature, but for his worth. <q rend="inline">"Whenever (ſaid he) a young man becomes Jorden's pupil, he becomes his ſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having given ſuch a ſpecimen of his poetical powers, he was aſked by Mr. Jorden to tranſlate Pope's Meſſiah into Latin verſe, as a Chriſtmas exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. He performed it with uncommon rapidity, and in ſo maſterly a manner,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0548300101:55"/>
 that he obtained great applauſe from it, which ever after kept him high in the eſtimation of his College, and, indeed, of all the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that Mr. Pope expreſſed himſelf concerning it in terms of ſtrong approbation. Dr. Taylor told me, that it was firſt printed for old Mr. Johnſon, without the knowledge of his ſon, who was very angry when he heard of it. A miſcellany of Poems, collected by a perſon of the name of Huſbands, was publiſhed at Oxford in 1731. In that miſcellany Johnſon's Tranſlation of the Meſſiah appeared, with this modeſt motto from Scaliger's Poeticks, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Ex alieno ingenio Poeta, ex ſuo tantum verſificator."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that critical objections have been made to this and other ſpecimens of Johnſon's Latin Poetry. I acknowledge myſelf not competent to decide on a queſtion of ſuch extreme nicety. But I am ſatisfied with the juſt and diſcriminative eulogy pronounced upon it by my friend Mr. Courtenay.</p>

               <p>The <q rend="inline">"morbid melancholy"</q> which was lurking in his conſtitution, and to which we may aſcribe thoſe particularities, and that averſion to regular life, which, at a very early period, marked his character, gathered ſuch ſtrength in his twentieth year, as to afflict him in a dreadful manner. While he was at Lichfield, in the College vacation of the year 1729, he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf overwhelmed with an horrible hypochondria, with perpetual irritation, fretfulneſs, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and deſpair, which made exiſtence miſery. From this diſmal malady he never afterwards was perfectly relieved; and all his labours, and all his enjoyments, were but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary interruptions of its baleful influence. How wonderful, how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are the ways of GOD! Johnſon, who was bleſt with all the powers of genius and underſtanding in a degree far above the ordinary ſtate of human nature, was at the ſame time viſited with a diſorder ſo afflictive, that they who know it by dire experience, will not envy his exalted endowments. That it was, in ſome degree, occaſioned by a defect in his nervous ſyſtem, that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable part of our frame, appears highly probable. He told Mr. Paradiſe that he was ſometimes ſo languid and inefficient, that he could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the hour upon the town-clock.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, upon the firſt violent attack of this diſorder, ſtrove to overcome it by forcible exertions. He frequently walked to Birmingham and back again, and tried many other expedients, but all in vain. His expreſſion concerning it to me was, <q rend="inline">"I did not then know how to manage it."</q> His diſtreſs became ſo intolerable, that he applied to Dr. Swinfen, phyſician in Lichfield, his godfather, and put into his hands a ſtate of his caſe, written in Latin. Dr. Swinfen was ſo much ſtruck with the extraordinary acuteneſs, reſearch, and eloquence of this paper, that in his zeal for his godſon he ſhewed it to ſeveral people. His daughter, Mrs. Deſmoulins, who was many years humanely ſupported in Dr. Johnſon's houſe in London, told me, that upon his diſcovering that Dr. Swinfen had communicated his caſe, he was ſo much offended, that he was never afterwards fully reconciled to him. He indeed had good reaſon to be offended; for though Dr. Swinfen's motive was good, he inconſiderately betrayed a matter deeply intereſting and of great delicacy, which had been entruſted to him in confidence; and expoſed a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0548300101:57"/> complaint of his young friend and patient, which, in the ſuperficial opinion of the generality of mankind, is attended with contempt and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>But let not little men triumph upon knowing that Johnſon was an HYPOCHONDRIACK, was ſubject to what the learned, philoſophical, and pious Dr. Cheyne has ſo well treated, under the title of <q rend="inline">"The Engliſh Malady."</q> Though he ſuffered ſev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ely from it, he was not therefore degraded. The powers of his great mind might be troubled, and their full exerciſe ſuſpended at times, but the mind itſelf was ever entire. As a proof of this, it is only neceſſary to conſider, that, when he was at the very worſt, he compoſed that ſtate of his own caſe, which ſhewed an uncommon vigour, not only of fancy and taſte, but of judgement. I am aware that he himſelf was too ready to call ſuch a complaint by the name of <hi>madneſs;</hi> in conformity with which notion, he has traced its gradations, with exquiſite nicety, in one of the chapters of his RASSELAS. But there is ſurely a clear diſtinction between a diſorder which affects only the imagination and ſpirits, while the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſound, and a diſorder by which the judgement itſelf is impaired. This diſtinction was made to me by the late Profeſſor Gaubius of Leyden, phyſician to the Prince of Orange, in a converſation which I had with him ſeveral years ago, and he expanded it thus: <q rend="inline">"If (ſaid he) a man tells me that he is grievouſly diſturbed, for that he <hi>imagines</hi> he ſees a ruffian coming againſt him with a drawn ſword, though at the ſame time he is <hi>conſcious</hi> it is a deluſion, I pronounce him to have a diſordered imagination; but if a man tells me that he <hi>ſees</hi> this, and in conſternation calls to me to look at it, I pronounce him to be <hi>mad."</hi>

               </p>

To Johnſon, whoſe ſupreme enjoyment was the exerciſe of his reaſon, the diſturbance or obſcuration of that faculty was the evil moſt to be dreaded. Inſanity, therefore, was the object of his moſt diſmal apprehenſion; and he fancied himſelf ſeized by it, or approaching to it, at the very time when he was giving proofs of a more than ordinary ſoundneſs and vigour of judgement. That his own diſeaſed imagination ſhould have ſo far deceived him, is ſtrange; but it is ſtranger ſtill that ſome of his friends ſhould have given credit to his groundleſs

opinion, when they had ſuch undoubted proofs that it was totally fallacious; though it is by no means ſurpriſing that thoſe who wiſh to depreciate him, ſhould, ſince his death, have laid hold of this circumſtance, and inſiſted upon it with very unfair aggravation.</p>
               <p>Amidſt the oppreſſion and diſtraction of a diſeaſe which very few have felt in its full extent, but many have experienced in a ſlighter degree, Johnſon, in his writings, and in his converſation, never failed to diſplay all the varieties of intellectual excellence. In his march through this world to a better, his mind ſtill appeared grand and brilliant, and impreſſed all around him with the truth of Virgil's noble ſentiment—<q rend="inline">

               <p>The hiſtory of his mind as to religion is an important article. I have mentioned the early impreſſions made upon his tender imagination by his mother, who continued her pious care with aſſiduity, but, in his opinion, not with judgement. <q rend="inline">"Sunday (ſaid he) was a heavy day to me when I was a boy. My mother confined me on that day, and made me read 'The Whole Duty of Man,' from a great part of which I could derive no inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When, for inſtance, I had read the chapter on theft, which from my infancy I had been taught was wrong, I was no more convinced that theft was wrong than before; ſo there was no acceſſion of knowledge. A boy ſhould be introduced to ſuch books, by having his attention directed to the arrangement, to the ſtile, and other excellencies of compoſition; that the mind being thus engaged by an amuſing variety of objects, may not grow weary."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He communicated to me the following particulars upon the ſubject of his religious progreſs. <q rend="inline">"I fell into an inattention to religion, or an indifference about it, in my ninth year. The church at Lichfield, in which we had a ſeat, wanted reparation, ſo I was to go and find a ſeat in other churches; and having bad eyes, and being aukward about this, I to go and read in the fields on Sunday. This habit continued till my fourteenth year; and ſtill I find a great reluctance to go to church. I then became a ſort of lax <hi>talker</hi> againſt religion, for I did not much <hi>think</hi> againſt it; and this laſted till I went to Oxford, where it would not be <hi>ſuffered.</hi> When at Oxford, I took up 'Law's Serious Call to the Unconverted,' expecting to find it a dull book, (as ſuch books generally are,) and perhaps to laugh at it. But I found Law quite an overmatch for me; and this was the firſt occaſion of my thinking in earneſt of religion, after I became capable of rational inquiry <note n="4" place="bottom">
                        <p>Mrs. Piozzi has given a ſtrange fantaſtical account of the origin of Dr. Johnſon's belief in our moſt holy religion. <q rend="inline">"At the age of <hi>ten</hi> years his mind was diſturbed by ſcruples of infidelity, which preyed upon his ſpirits, and made him very uneaſy, the more ſo, as he revealed his uneaſineſs to none, being naturally (as he ſaid) of a ſullen temper, and reſerved diſpoſition. He ſearched, however, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, but fruitleſsly, for evidences of the truth of revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, at length, <hi>recollecting</hi> a book he had <hi>once</hi> ſeen <hi>[I ſuppoſe at five years old]</hi> in his father's ſhop, intitled <hi>De veritate Religionis,</hi> &amp;c. he began to think himſelf <hi>highly culpable</hi> for neglecting ſuch a means of information, and took him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeverely to taſk for this <hi>ſin,</hi> adding many acts of voluntary, and, to others, unknown <hi>pennance.</hi> The firſt opportunity which offered, of courſe, he ſeized the book with avidity; but, on exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>not finding himſelf ſcholar enough to peruſe its contents,</hi> ſet his heart at reſt; and not thinking to enquire whether there were any Engliſh books written on the ſubject, followed his uſual amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>conſidered his conſcience as lightened of a crime.</hi> He redoubled his diligence to learn the language that contained the information he moſt wiſhed for; but from the pain which <hi>guilt [namely, having omitted to read what he did not underſtand]</hi> had given him, he now began to deduce the ſoul's immortality, <hi>[a ſenſation of pain in this world being an unqueſtionable proof of exiſtence in another]</hi> which was the point that belief firſt ſtopped at; <hi>and from that moment reſolving to be a Chriſtian,</hi> became one of the moſt zealous and pious ones our nation ever produced."</q> Anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, p. 17.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the numerous miſrepreſentations of this lively lady, which it is worth while to correct; for if credit ſhould be given to ſuch a childiſh, irrational, and ridiculous ſtatement of the foundation of Dr. Johnſon's faith in Chriſtianity, how little credit would be due to it. Mrs. Piozzi ſeems to wiſh, that the world ſhould think Dr. Johnſon alſo under the influence of that eaſy logick, <hi>Stet pro ratione voluntas.</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0548300101:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> forward, religion was the predominant object of his thoughts; though, with the juſt ſentiments of a conſcientious chriſtian, he lamented that his practice of its duties fell far ſhort of what it ought to be.</p>
               <p>This inſtance of a mind ſuch as that of Johnſon being firſt diſpoſed, by an unexpected incident, to think with anxiety of the momentous concerns of eternity, and of <q rend="inline">"what he ſhould do to be ſaved,"</q> may for ever be produced in oppoſition to the ſuperficial and ſometimes profane contempt that has been thrown upon thoſe occaſional impreſſions which it is certain many chriſtians have experienced; though it muſt be acknowledged that weak minds, from an erroneous ſuppoſition that no man is in a ſtate of grace who has not felt a particular converſion, have, in ſome caſes, brought a degree of ridicule upon them; a ridicule, of which it is inconſiderate or unfair to make a general application.</p>
               <p>How ſeriouſly Johnſon was impreſſed with a ſenſe of religion, even in the vigour of his youth, appears from the following paſſage in his minutes kept by way of diary: <q rend="inline">"Sept. 7, 1736. I have this day entered upon my 28th year. Mayeſt thou, O GOD, enable me, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake, to ſpend this in ſuch a manner, that I may receive comfort from it at the hour of death, and in the day of judgement! Amen."</q>

The particular courſe of his reading while at Oxford, and during the time of vacation which he paſſed at home, cannot be traced. Enough has been ſaid of his irregular mode of ſtudy. He told me, that from his earlieſt years he loved to read poetry, but hardly ever read any poem to an end; that he read Shakſpeare at a period ſo early, that the ſpeech of the Ghoſt in Hamlet terrified him when he was alone; that Horace's Odes were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in which he took moſt delight, and it was long before he liked his Epiſtles and Satires. He told me what he read <hi>ſolidly</hi> at Oxford was Greek; not the Grecian hiſtorians, but Homer and Euripides, and now and then a little Epigram; that the ſtudy of which he was moſt fond was Metaphyſicks, but he had not read much, even in that way. I always thought that he did himſelf injuſtice in his account of what he had read, and that he muſt have been ſpeaking with reference to the vaſt portion of ſtudy which is poſſible, and to which a few ſcholars in the whole hiſtory of literature have attained; for when I once aſked him whether a perſon whoſe name I have now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, ſtudied hard, he anſwered <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. I do not believe he ſtudied hard. I never knew a man who ſtudied hard. I conclude, indeed, from the effects, that ſome men have ſtudied hard, as Bentley and Clarke."</q> Trying him by that criterion upon which he formed his judgement of others, we may be abſolutely certain, both from his writings and his converſation, that his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was very extenſive. Dr. Adam Smith, than whom few are better judges on this ſubject, once obſerved to me that <q rend="inline">"Johnſon knew more books than any man alive."</q> He had a peculiar facility in ſeizing at once what was valuable in any book, without ſubmitting to the labour of peruſing it from beginning to end. He had, from the irritability of his conſtitution, at all times, an impatience and hurry when he either read or wrote. A certain apprehenſion, ariſing from novelty, made him write his firſt exerciſe at College twice over; but he never took that trouble with any other compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and we ſhall ſee that his moſt excellent works were ſtruck off at a heat, with rapid exertion.</p>
               <p>Yet he appears, from his early notes or memorandums, in my poſſeſſion, to have at various times attempted, or at leaſt planned, a methodical courſe of ſtudy, according to computation, of which he was all his life fond, as it fixed his attention ſteadily upon ſomething without, and prevented his mind from preying upon itſelf. Thus I find in his hand-writing the number of lines in each of two of Euripides's Tragedies, of the Georgicks of Virgil, of the firſt ſix books of the Aeneid, of Horace's Art of Poetry, of three of the books of Ovid's Metamorphoſis, of ſome parts of Theocritus, and of the tenth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0548300101:61"/> Satire of Juvenal; and a table, ſhewing at the rate of various numbers day, (I ſuppoſe verſes to be read) what would be, in each caſe, the tota amount in a week, month, and year.</p>
               <p>No man had a more ardent love of literature, or a higher reſpect for it than Johnſon. His apartment in Pembroke College was that upon the ſecond floor, over the gateway. The enthuſiaſts of learning will ever contemplate it with veneration. One day, while he was ſitting in it quite alone, Dr. Panting then maſter of the College, whom he called <q rend="inline">"a fine Jacobite fellow,"</q> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard him uttering this ſoliloquy in his ſtrong emphatick voice: <q rend="inline">"Well, I have a mind to ſee what is done in other places of learning. I'll go and viſit the Univerſities abroad. I'll go to France and Italy. I'll go to Padua.—And I'll mind my buſineſs. For an <hi>Athenian</hi> blockhead is the worſt of all blockheads <note n="5" place="bottom">I had this anecdote from Dr. Adams, and Dr. Johnſon confirmed it. Bramſton, in his <q rend="inline">"Man of Taſte,"</q> has the ſame thought:
<q>
                           <l>"Sure, of all blockheads, ſcholars are the worſt."</l>

               </p>
               <p>Dr. Adams told me, that Johnſon, while he was at Pembroke College, <q rend="inline">"was careſſed and loved by all about him, was a gay and frolickſome fellow, and paſſed there the happieſt part of his life."</q> But this is a ſtriking proof of the fallacy of appearances, and how little any of us know of the real internal ſtate even of thoſe whom we ſee moſt frequently; for the truth is, that he was then depreſſed by poverty, and irritated by diſeaſe. When I mentioned to him this account as given me by Dr. Adams, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Ah, Sir, I was mad and violent. It was bitterneſs which they miſtook for frolick. I was miſerably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my literature and my wit; ſo I diſregarded all power and all authority."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of Dromore obſerves in a letter to me, <q rend="inline">"The pleaſure he took in vexing the tutors and fellows has been often mentioned. But I have heard him ſay, what ought to be recorded to the honour of the preſent vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maſter of that College, the Reverend William Adams, D. D. who was then very young, and one of the junior fellows; that the mild but judicious expoſtulations of this worthy man, whoſe virtue awed him, and whoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he revered, made him really aſhamed of himſelf, 'though I fear (ſaid he) I was too proud to own it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I have heard from ſome of his cotemporaries that he was generally ſeen lounging at the College gate, with a circle of young ſtudents round him, whom he was entertaining with wit, and keeping from their ſtudies, if not

               </p>
               <p>He very early began to attempt keeping notes or memorandums, by way of a diary of his life. I find, in a parcel of looſe leaves, the following ſpirited reſolution to contend againſt his natural indolence: <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Oct.</hi> 1729. <hi>Deſidiae valedixi; ſyrenis iſtius cantibus ſurdam poſthac aurem obverſurus.</hi>—I bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to Sloth, being reſolved henceforth not to liſten to her ſyren ſtrains."</q> I have alſo in my poſſeſſion a few leaves of another <hi>Libellus,</hi> or little book, entitled ANNALES, in which ſome of the early particulars of his hiſtory are regiſtered in Latin.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1730" type="year">
               <p>I do not find that he formed any cloſe intimacies with his fellow-collegians. But Dr. Adams told me, that he contracted a love and regard for Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke College, which he retained to the laſt. A ſhort time before his death he ſent to that College a preſent of all his works, to be depoſited in their library, and he had thoughts of leaving to it his houſe at Lichfield; but his friends who were about him very properly diſſuaded him from it, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed it to ſome poor relations. He took a pleaſure in boaſting of the many eminent men who had been educated at Pembroke. In this liſt are found the names of Spenſer, Mr. Hawkins the Poetry Profeſſor, Mr. Shenſtone, Sir William Blackſtone, and others <note n="6" place="bottom">See Naſh's Hiſtory of Worceſterſhire, Vol. I. p. 529.</note>, not forgetting the celebrated popular preacher, Mr. George Whitefield, of whom, though Dr. Johnſon did not think very highly, it muſt be acknowledged that his eloquence was powerful, his views pious and charitable, his aſſiduity almoſt incredible; and, that ſince his death, the integrity of his character has been fully vindicated. Being himſelf a poet, Johnſon was peculiarly happy in mentioning how many of the ſons of Pembroke were poets; adding, with a ſmile of ſportive triumph, <q rend="inline">"Sir, we are a neſt of ſinging birds."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was not, however, blind to what he thought the defects of his own College; and I have, from the information of Dr. Taylor, a very ſtrong inſtance of that rigid honeſty which he ever inflexibly preſerved. Taylor had obtained his father's conſent to be entered of Pembroke, that he might be with his ſchoolfellow Johnſon, with whom, though ſome years older than himſelf, he was very intimate. This would have been a great comfort to Johnſon. But he fairly told Taylor that he could not, in conſcience, ſuffer him to enter where he knew he could not have an able tutor. He then made inquiry all round the Univerſity, and having found that Mr. Bateman, of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0548300101:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Chriſt-Church, was the tutor of higheſt reputation, Taylor was entered of that College. Mr. Bateman's lectures were ſo excellent, that Johnſon uſed to come and get-them at ſecond-hand from Taylor, till his poverty being ſo extreme, that his ſhoes were worn out, and his feet appeared through them, he ſaw that this humiliating circumſtance was perceived by the Chriſt-church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and he came no more. He was too proud to accept of money, and ſomebody having ſet a pair of new ſhoes at his door, he threw them away with indignation. How muſt we feel when we read ſuch an anecdote of Samuel Johnſon!</p>
               <p>His ſpirited refuſal of an eleemoſynary ſupply of ſhoes, aroſe, no doubt, from a proper pride. But, conſidering his aſcetick diſpoſition at times, as acknowledged by himſelf in his Meditations, and the exaggeration with which ſome have treated the peculiarities of his character, I ſhould not wonder to hear it aſcribed to a principle of ſuperſtitious mortification; as we are told by Turſellinus, in his Life of St. Ignatius Loyola, that this intrepid founder of the order of Jeſuits, when he arrived at Goa, after having made a ſevere pilgrimage through the eaſtern deſerts, perſiſted in wearing his miſerable ſhattered ſhoes, and when new ones were offered him, rejected them as an unſuitable indulgence.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1731" type="year">
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1731. Aetat. 22."/> The <hi>res anguſta domi</hi> prevented him from having the advantage of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete academical education. The friend to whom he had truſted for ſupport had deceived him. His debts in College, though not great, were increaſing; and his ſcanty remittances from Lichfield, which had all along been made with great difficulty, could be ſupplied no longer, his father having fallen into a ſtate of inſolvency. Compelled, therefore, by irreſiſtible neceſſity, he left the College in autumn, 1731, without a degree, having been a member of it little more than three years.</p>
               <p>Dr. Adams, the worthy and reſpectable maſter of Pembroke College, has generally had the reputation of being Johnſon's tutor. The fact, however, is, that in 1731 Mr. Jorden quitted the College, and his pupils were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Dr. Adams; ſo that had Johnſon returned, Dr. Adams <hi>would have been his tutor.</hi> It is to be wiſhed, that this connection had taken place. His equal temper, mild diſpoſition, and politeneſs of manners, might have inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſoftened the harſhneſs of Johnſon, and infuſed into him thoſe more delicate charities, that <hi>petite morale,</hi> in which, it muſt be confeſſed, our great moraliſt was more deficient than his beſt friends could fully juſtify. Dr. Adams paid Johnſon this high compliment. He ſaid to me at Oxford, in 1776, <q rend="inline">"I was his nominal tutor, but he was above my mark."</q> When I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0548300101:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
repeated it to Johnſon, his eyes flaſhed with grateful ſatisfaction, and he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"That was liberal and noble."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>poor)</hi> Samuel Johnſon returned to his native city, deſtitute, and not knowing how he ſhould gain even a decent livelihood. His father's misfortunes in trade rendered him unable to ſupport his ſon; and for ſome time there appeared no means by which he could maintain himſelf. In the December of this year his father died.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of poverty in which he died, appears from a note in one of Johnſon's little diaries of the following year, which ſtrongly diſplays his ſpirit and virtuous dignity of mind. <q rend="inline">"1732, <hi>Julii</hi> 15. <hi>Undecim aureos depoſui, quo die quicquid ante matris funus (quod ſerum ſit precor) de paternis bonis ſperari licet, viginti ſcilicet libras accepi.

I now, therefore, ſee that I muſt make my own fortune. Meanwhile, let me take care that the powers of my mind may not be debilitated by poverty, and that indigence do not force me into any criminal act."</q>

               <p>Johnſon was ſo far fortunate, that the reſpectable character of his parents, and his own merit, had, from his earlieſt years, ſecured him a kind reception in the beſt families at Lichfield. Among theſe I can mention Mr. Howard, Dr. Swinfen, Mr. Simpſon, Mr. Levett, Captain Garrick, father of the great ornament of the Britiſh ſtage; but above all, Mr. Gilbert Walmſley <note n="7" place="bottom">Mr. Warton informs me, <q rend="inline">"that this early friend of Johnſon was entered a Commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, aged 17, in 1698; and is the authour of many Latin verſe tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Gentleman's Magazine.</q> One of them is a tranſlation of

                  </note>, Regiſter of the Prerogative Court of Lichfield, whoſe character, long after his deceaſe, Dr. Johnſon has, in his life of Edmund Smith, thus drawn in the glowing colours of gratitude:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Of Gilbert Walmſley, thus preſented to my mind, let me indulge myſelf in the remembrance. I knew him very early; he was one of the firſt friends that literature procured me, and I hope that, at leaſt, my gratitude made me worthy of his notice.</p>
                  <p>He was of an advanced age, and I was only not a boy; yet he never received my notions with contempt. He was a whig, with all the virulence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0548300101:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 and malevolence of his party; yet difference of opinion did not keep us apart. I honoured him, and he endured me.</p>
                  <p>He had mingled with the gay world without exemption from its vices or its follies; but had never neglected the cultivation of his mind. His belief of revelation was unſhaken; his learning preſerved his principles; he grew firſt regular, and then pious.</p>
                  <p>His ſtudies had been ſo various, that I am not able to name a man of equal knowledge. His acquaintance with books was great, and what he did not immediately know, he could, at leaſt, tell where to find. Such was his amplitude of learning, and ſuch his copiouſneſs of communication, that it may be doubted whether a day now paſſes, in which I have not ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from his friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>At this man's table I enjoyed many cheerful and inſtructive hours, with companions, ſuch as are not often found—with one who has lengthened, and one who has gladdened life; with Dr. James, whoſe ſkill in phyſick will be long remembered; and with David Garrick, whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend. But what are the hopes of man! I am diſappointed by that ſtroke of death, which has eclipſed the gaiety of nations, and impoveriſhed the publick ſtock of harmleſs pleaſure.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In theſe families he paſſed much time in his early years. In moſt of them, he was in the company of ladies, particularly at Mr. Walmſley's, whoſe wife and ſiſters-in-law, of the name of Aſton, and daughters of a baronet, were remarkable for good breeding; ſo that the notion which has been induſtriouſly circulated and believed, that he never was in good company till late in life, and, conſequently, had been confirmed in coarſe and ferocious manners by long habits, is wholly without foundation. Some of the ladies have aſſured me, they recollected him well when a young man, as diſtinguiſhed for his complaiſance.</p>

Aetat. 23."/> During his ſtay at Aſhbourn, he made frequent viſits to Mr. Meynell, at Brodley, where his company was much deſired by the ladies of the family, who were, perhaps, in point of elegance and accompliſhments, inferiour to few of thoſe with whom he was afterwards acquainted. Mr. Meynell's eldeſt daughter was afterwards married to Mr. Fitzherbert, father to Mr. Alleyne Fitzherbert, lately miniſter to the court of Ruſſia. Of her, Dr. Johnſon ſaid, in Dr. Lawrence's ſtudy, that ſhe had the beſt underſtanding he ever met with in any human being. At Mr. Meynell's he alſo commenced that friendſhip with Mrs. Hill Boothby, ſiſter to the preſent Sir Brook Boothby, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till her death. The <hi>young woman whom he uſed to call Molly Aſton</hi> 
                     <note n="8" place="bottom">The words of Sir John Hawkins, p. 316.</note>, was ſiſter to Sir Thomas Aſton, and daughter to a Baronet; ſhe was likewiſe ſiſter to the wife of his friend Mr. Gilbert Walmſley. Beſides his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with the above-mentioned perſons, who were ſurely people of rank and education, while he was yet at Lichfield he uſed to be frequently at the houſe of Dr. Swinfen, a gentleman of a very ancient family in Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, from which, after the death of his elder brother, he inherited a good eſtate. He was, beſides, a phyſician of very extenſive practice; but for want of due attention to the management of his domeſtic concerns, left a very large family in indigence. One of his daughters, Mrs. Deſmoulins, afterwards found an aſylum in the houſe of her old friend, whoſe doors were always open to the unfortunate, and who well obſerved the precept of the goſpel, for he was kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In the ſorlorn ſtate of his circumſtances he accepted of an offer to be employed as uſher in the ſchool of Market-Boſworth, in Leiceſterſhire, to which it appears, from one of his little fragments of a diary, that he went on foot, on the 16th of July,—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Julii</hi> 16. <hi>Boſvortiam pedes petii."</hi>
                  </q> But it is not true, as has been erroneouſly related, that he was aſſiſtant to the famous Anthony Blackwall, whoſe merit has been honoured by the teſtimony of Biſhop Hurd, who was his ſcholar; for Mr. Blackwall died on the 8th of April, 1730 <note n="9" place="bottom">See Gent. Mag. Dec. 1784, p. 957.</note>, more than a year before Johnſon left the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>This employment was very irkſome to him in every reſpect, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained grievouſly of it in his letters to his friend Mr. Hector, who was now ſettled as a ſurgeon at Birmingham. The letters are loſt; but Mr. Hector recollects his writing <q rend="inline">"that the poet had deſcribed the dull ſameneſs of his exiſtence in theſe words, <hi>'Vitam continet una dies'</hi> (one day contains the whole

Aetat. 24."/> of my life); that it was unvaried as the note of the cuckow; and that he did not know whether it was more diſagreeable for him to teach, or the boys to learn, the grammar rules."</q> His general averſion to this painful drudgery was greatly enhanced by a diſagreement between him and Sir Woolſton Dixey, the patron of the ſchool, in whoſe houſe, I have been told, he officiated as a kind of domeſtick chaplain, ſo far, at leaſt, as to ſay grace at table, but was treated with what he repreſented as intolerable harſhneſs; and, after ſuffering for a few months ſuch complicated miſery, he relinquiſhed a ſituation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the ſtrongeſt averſion, and even a degree of horrour. But it is probable that at this period, whatever uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he may have endured, he laid the foundation of much future eminence by application to his ſtudies.</p>
               <p>Being now again totally unoccupied, he was invited by Mr. Hector to paſs ſome time with him at Birmingham, as his gueſt, at the houſe of Mr. Warren, with whom Mr. Hector lodged and boarded. Mr. Warren was the firſt eſtabliſhed bookſeller in Birmingham, and was very attentive to Johnſon, who he ſoon found could be of much ſervice to him in his trade, by his knowledge of literature; and he even obtained the aſſiſtance of his pen in furniſhing ſome numbers of a periodical Eſſay printed in the newſpaper, of which Warren was proprietor. After very diligent inquiry, I have not been able to recover thoſe early ſpecimens of that particular mode of writing by which Johnſon afterwards ſo greatly diſtinguiſhed himſelf.</p>
               <p>He continued to live as Mr. Hector's gueſt for about ſix months, and then hired lodgings in another part of the town, finding himſelf as well ſituated at Birmingham as he ſuppoſed he could be any where, while he had no ſettled plan of life, and very ſcanty means of ſubſiſtence. He made ſome valuable acquaintances there, amongſt whom were Mr. Porter, a mercer, whoſe widow he afterwards married, and Mr. Taylor, who by his ingenuity in mechanical inventions, and his ſucceſs in trade, acquired an immenſe fortune. But the comfort of being near Mr. Hector, his old ſchoolfellow and intimate friend, was Johnſon's chief inducement to continue here.</p>

            <div n="1733" type="year">
               <p>In what manner he employed his pen at this period, or whether he derived from it any pecuniary advantage, I have not been able to aſcertain. He probably got a little money from Mr. Warren; and we are certain, that he executed here one piece of literary labour, of which Mr. Hector has favoured me with a minute account. Having mentioned that he had read at Pembroke College a Voyage to Abyſſinia, by Lobo, a Portugueſe jeſuit, and that he thought an abridgement and tranſlation of it from the French into Engliſh
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0548300101:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be an uſeful and profitable publication, Mr. Warren and Mr. Hector joined in urging him to undertake it. He accordingly agreed; and the book not being to be found in Birmingham, he borrowed it of Pembroke College. A part of the work being very ſoon done, one Oſborn, who was Mr. Warren's printer, was ſet to work with what was ready, and Johnſon engaged to ſupply the preſs with copy as it ſhould be wanted; but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional indolence ſoon prevailed, and the work was at a ſtand. Mr. Hector, who knew that a motive of humanity would be the moſt prevailing argument with his friend, went to Johnſon, and repreſented to him, that the printer could have no other employment till this undertaking was finiſhed, and that the poor man and his family were ſuffering. Johnſon upon this exerted the powers of his mind, though his body was relaxed. He lay in bed with the book, which was a quarto, before him, and dictated while Hector wrote. Mr. Hector carried the ſheets to the preſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and corrected almoſt all the proof ſheets, very few of which were even ſeen by Johnſon. In this manner, with the aid of Mr. Hector's active friendſhip, the book was completed, and was publiſhed in 1735, with LONDON upon the title-page, though it was in reality printed at Birmingham, a device too common with provincial publiſhers. For this work he had from Mr. Warren only the ſum of five guineas.</p>
               <p>This being the firſt proſe work of Johnſon, it is a curious object of inquiry how much may be traced in it of that ſtyle which marks his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent writings with ſuch peculiar excellence; with ſo happy an union of force, vivacity, and perſpicuity. I have peruſed the book with this view, and have found that here, as I believe in every other tranſlation, there is in the work itſelf no veſtige of the tranſlator's own ſtyle; for the language of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation being adapted to the thoughts of another perſon, inſenſibly follows their caſt, and, as it were, runs into a mould that is ready prepared.</p>
               <p>Thus, for inſtance, taking the firſt ſentence that occurs at the opening of the book, p. 4. <q rend="inline">"I lived here above a year, and completed my ſtudies in divinity; in which time ſome letters were received from the fathers in Ethiopia, with an account that Sultan Segned, Emperour of Abyſſinia, was converted to the church of Rome; that many of his ſubjects had followed his example, and that there was a great want of miſſionaries to improve theſe proſperous beginnings. Every body was very deſirous of ſeconding the zeal of our fathers, and of ſending them the aſſiſtance they requeſted; to which we were the more encouraged, becauſe the Emperour's letter informed our Provincial, that we might eaſily enter his dominions by the way of Dancala;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0548300101:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unhappily, the ſecretary wrote Geila for Dancala, which coſt two of our fathers their lives."</q> Every one acquainted with Johnſon's manner will be ſenſible that there is nothing of it here, but that this ſentence might have been compoſed by any other man.</p>
               <p>But, in the Preface, the Johnſonian ſtyle begins to appear; and though uſe had not yet taught his wing a permanent and equable flight, there are parts of it which exhibit his beſt manner in full vigour. I had once the pleaſure of examining it with Mr. Edmund Burke, who confirmed me in this opinion, by his ſuperious critical ſagacity, and was, I remember, much delighted with the following ſpecimen:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Portugueſe traveller, contrary to the general vein of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, has amuſed his reader with no romantick abſurdity, or incredible fictions; whatever he relates, whether true or not, is at leaſt probable; and he who tells nothing exceeding the bounds of probability, has a right to demand that they ſhould believe him who cannot contradict him.</p>
                  <p>He appears, by his modeſt and unaffected narration, to have deſcribed things as he ſaw them, to have copied nature from-the life, and to have conſulted his ſenſes, not his imagination. He meets with no baſiliſks that deſtroy with their eyes, his crocodiles devour their prey without tears, and his cataracts fall from the rocks without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>The reader will here find no regions curſed with irremediable barrenneſs, or bleſſed with ſpontaneous fecundity; no perpetual gloom, or unceaſing ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine; nor are the nations here deſcribed either devoid of all ſenſe of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or conſummate in all private or ſocial virtues. Here are no Hottentots without religious polity or articulate language; no Chineſe perfectly polite, and completely ſkilled in all ſciences; he will diſcover, what will always be diſcovered by a diligent and impartial enquirer, that wherever human nature is to be found, there is a mixture of vice and virtue, a conteſt of paſſion and reaſon; and that the Creator doth not appear partial in his diſtributions, but has balanced, in moſt countries, their particular inconveniencies by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favours.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here we have an early example of that brilliant and energetick expreſſion, which, upon innumerable occaſions in his ſubſequent life, juſtly impreſſed the world with the higheſt admiration.</p>
               <p>Nor can any one, converſant with the writings of Johnſon, fail to diſcern his hand in this paſſage of the Dedication to John Warren, Eſq. of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brokeſhire, though it is aſcribed to Warren the bookſeller. <q rend="inline">"A generous and elevated mind is diſtinguiſhed by nothing more certainly than an eminent

degree of curioſity; nor is that curioſity ever more agreeably or uſefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1734.

I hope, therefore, the preſent I now preſume to make, will not be thought improper; which, however, it is not my buſineſs as a dedicator to commend, nor as a bookſeller to depreciate."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that his having been thus accidentally led to a particular ſtudy of the hiſtory and manners of Abyſſinia, was the remote occaſion of his writing, many years afterwards, his admirable philoſophical tale, the principal ſcene of which is laid in that country.</p>

               <p>Johnſon had, from his early youth, been ſenſible to the influence of female charms. When at Stourbridge ſchool, he was much enamoured of Olivia Lloyd, a young quaker, to whom he wrote a copy of verſes, which I have not been able to recover; and I am aſſured by Miſs Seward, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a tender paſſion for Miſs Lucy Porter, daughter of the lady whom he afterwards married. Miſs Porter was ſent very young on a viſit to Lichfield, where Johnſon had frequent opportunities of ſeeing and admiring her; and he addreſſed to her the following verſes, on her preſenting him with a noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of myrtle:</p>

               <p>His juvenile attachments to the fair ſex were, however, very tranſient; and it is certain, that he formed no criminal connection whatſoever. Mr. Hector, who lived with him in his younger days in the utmoſt intimacy and ſocial freedom, has aſſured me, that even at that ardent ſeaſon his conduct was ſtrictly virtuous in that reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that though he loved to exhilarate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with wine, he never knew him intoxicated but once.</p>
               <p>In a man whom religious education has ſecured from licentious indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the paſſion of love, when once it has ſeized him, is exceedingly ſtrong; being unimpaired by diſſipation, and totally concentrated in one object. This was experienced by Johnſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he became the ſervent admirer of Mrs. Porter, after her firſt huſband's death. Miſs Porter told me, that when he was firſt introduced to her mother, his appearance was very forbidding: He was then lean and lank, ſo that his immenſe ſtructure of bones was hideouſly ſtriking to the eye, and the ſcars of the ſcrophula were deeply viſible. He alſo wore his hair, which was ſtraight and ſtiff, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated behind; and he often had, ſeemingly, convulſive ſtarts and odd geſticulations, which tended to excite at once ſurpriſe and ridicule. Mrs. Porter was ſo much engaged by his converſation that ſhe overlooked all theſe external diſadvantages, and ſaid to her daughter, <q rend="inline">"this is the moſt ſenſible man that I ever ſaw in my life."</q>

But Mrs. Johnſon knew too well the ardour of her ſon's temper, and was too tender a parent to oppoſe his inclinations.</p>
               <p>I know not for what reaſon the marriage ceremony was not performed at Birmingham; but a reſolution was taken that it ſhould be at Derby, for which place the bride and bridegroom ſet out on horſeback, I ſuppoſe in very good humour. But though Mr. Topham Beauclerk uſed archly to mention Johnſon's having told him, with much gravity, <q rend="inline">"Sir, it was a love-marriage upon both ſides,"</q> I have had from my illuſtrious friend the following curious<note place="margin">9th July.</note> account of their journey to church upon the nuptial morn. <q rend="inline">"Sir, ſhe had read the old romances, and had got into her head the fantaſtical notion that a woman of ſpirit ſhould uſe her lover like a dog.

               <p>This, it muſt be allowed, was a ſingular beginning of connubial felicity; but there is no doubt that Johnſon, though he thus ſhewed a manly firmneſs, proved a moſt affectionate and indulgent huſband to the laſt moment of Mrs. Johnſon's life; and in his <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> we find very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence that his regard and fondneſs for her never ceaſed, even after her death.</p>

               <p>He now ſet up a private academy, for which purpoſe he hired a large houſe, well ſituated near his native city. In the Gentleman's Magazine for 1736, there is the following advertiſement: <q rend="inline">"At Edial, near Lichfield, in Staffordſhire, young gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek languages, by SAMUEL JOHNSON."</q> But the only pupils that were put under his care were the celebrated David Garrick and his brother George, and a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0548300101:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mr. Offely, a young gentleman of good fortune, who died early. As yet, his name had nothing of that celebrity which afterwards commanded the higheſt attention and reſpect of mankind. Had ſuch an advertiſement appeared after the publication of his LONDON, or his RAMBLER, or his DICTIONARY, how would it have burſt upon the world! with what eagerneſs would the great and the wealthy have embraced an opportunity of putting their ſons under the learned tuition of SAMUEL JOHNSON. The truth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is, that he was not ſo well qualified for being a teacher of elements, and a conductor in learning by regular gradations, as men of inferiour powers of mind. His own acquiſitions had been made by fits and ſtarts, by violent irruptions into the regions of knowledge; and it could not be expected that his impatience would be ſubdued, and his impetuoſity reſtrained, ſo as to fit him for a quiet guide to novices. The art of communicating inſtruction, of whatever kind, is much to be valued; and I have ever thought that thoſe who devote themſelves to this employment, and do their duty with diligence and ſucceſs, are entitled to very high reſpect from the community, as Johnſon himſelf often maintained. Yet I am of opinion, that the greateſt abilities are not only not required for this office, but render a man leſs fit for it.</p>
               <p>While we acknowledge the juſtneſs of Thomſon's beautiful remark,
<q>
                     <l>"Delightful taſk! to rear the tender thought,</l>
                     <l>"And teach the young idea how to ſhoot!"</l>
                  </q>
we muſt conſider that this delight is perceptible only by <q rend="inline">"a mind at eaſe,"</q> a mind at once calm and clear; but that a mind gloomy and impetuous like that of Johnſon, cannot be fixed for any length of time in minute attention, and muſt be ſo frequently irritated by unavoidable ſlowneſs and errour in the advances of ſcholars, as to perform the duty with little pleaſure to the teacher, and no great advantage to the pupils. Good temper is a moſt eſſential requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in a preceptor. Horace paints the character as <hi>bland:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>"—Ut pueris olim dant cruſtula <hi>blandi</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>"Doctores, elementa velint ut diſcere prima."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon was not more ſatisfied with his ſituation as the maſter of an academy, than with that of the uſher of a ſchool; we need not wonder, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he did not keep his academy above a year and a half. From Mr. Garrick's account he did not appear to have been profoundly reverenced by his pupils. His oddities of manner, and uncouth geſticulations, could not but be the ſubject of merriment to them; and, in particular, the young rogues uſed to liſten at the door of his bed-chamber, and peep through the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0548300101:75" rendition="simple:additions"/> key-hole, that they might turn into ridicule his tumultuous and aukward fondneſs for Mrs. Johnſon, whom he uſed to name by the familiar appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Tetty</hi> or <hi>Tetſy,</hi> which, like <hi>Betty</hi> or <hi>Betſy,</hi> is provincially uſed as a contraction for <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> her chriſtian name, but which to us ſeems ludicrous, when applied to a woman of her age and appearance. Mr. Garrick deſcribed her to me as very fat, with a boſom of more than ordinary protuberance, with ſwelled cheeks, of a florid red, produced by thick painting, and increaſed by the liberal uſe of cordials; flaring and fantaſtick in her dreſs, and affected both in her ſpeech and her general behaviour. I have ſeen Garrick exhibit her, by his exquiſite talent for mimickry, ſo as to excite the heartieſt burſts of laughter; but he, probably, as is the caſe in all ſuch repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, conſiderably aggravated the picture.</p>
               <p>That Johnſon well knew the moſt proper courſe to be purſued in the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth, is authentically aſcertained by the following paper in his own hand-writing, given about this period to a relation, and now in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mr. John Nichols:

               <p>While Johnſon kept his academy, there can be no doubt that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly furniſhing his mind with various knowledge; but I have not diſcovered that he wrote any thing except a great part of his tragedy of IRENE. Mr. Peter Garrick; the elder brother of David, told me that he remembered Johnſon's borrowing the Turkiſh Hiſtory of him, in order to form his play from it. When he had finiſhed ſome part of it, he read what he had done to Mr. Walmſley, who objected to his having already brought his heroine into great diſtreſs, and aſked him <q rend="inline">"how can you poſſibly contrive to plunge her into deeper calamity?"</q> Johnſon, in ſly alluſion to the ſuppoſed oppreſſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the court of which Mr. Walmſley was regiſter, replied, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I can put her into the Spiritual Court!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Walmſley, however, was well pleaſed with this proof of Johnſon's abilities as a dramatick writer, and adviſed him to finiſh the tragedy, and produce it on the ſtage.</p>

It is a memorable circumſtance that his pupil David Garrick went thither at the ſame time, with intention to complete his education, and follow the profeſſion of the law, from which he was ſoon diverted by his decided preference for the ſtage.</p>

                        <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                        <p>I had the favour of yours, and am extremely obliged to you; but I cannot ſay I had a greater affection for you upon it than I had before, being long ſince ſo much endeared to you, as well by an early friendſhip, as by your many excellent and valuable qualifications; and, had I a ſon of my own, it would be my ambition, inſtead of ſending him to the Univerſity, to diſpoſe of him as this young gentleman is.</p>
                        <p>He, and another neighbour of mine, one Mr. Samuel Johnſon, ſet out this morning for London together. Davy Garrick is to be with you early the next week, and Mr. Johnſon to try his fate with a tragedy, and to ſee to get himſelf employed in ſome tranſlation, either from the Latin or the French. Johnſon is a very good ſcholar and poet, and I have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedy-writer. If it ſhould any way lie in your way, doubt not but you would be ready to recommend and aſſiſt your countryman.</p>

               <p>How he employed himſelf upon upon his firſt coming to London is not particularly known. I never heard that he found any protection or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the means of Mr. Colſon, to whoſe academy David Garrick went. Mrs. Lucy Porter told me, that Mr. Walmſley gave him a letter of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Lintot his bookſeller, and that Johnſon wrote ſome things for him; but I imagine this to be a miſtake, for I have diſcovered no trace of it, and I am pretty ſure he told me, that Mr. Cave was the firſt publiſher by whom his pen was engaged in London.</p>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0548300101:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He had a little money when he came to town, and he knew how he could live in the cheapeſt manner. His firſt lodgings were at the houſe of Mr. Norris, a ſtaymaker, in Exeter-ſtreet, adjoining Catharine-ſtreet, in the Strand. <q rend="inline">"I dined (ſaid he) very well for eight-pence, with very good company, at the Pine Apple in New-ſtreet, juſt by. Several of them had travelled. They expected to meet every day; but did not know one another's names. It uſed to coſt the reſt a ſhilling, for they drank wine; but I had a cut of meat for ſix-pence, and bread for a penny, and gave the waiter a penny; ſo that I was quite well ſerved, nay, better than the reſt, for they gave the waiter nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He at this time, I believe, abſtained entirely from fermented liquors; a practice to which he rigidly conformed for many years together, at different periods of his life.</p>
               <p>His OFELLUS in the <hi>Art of living in London,</hi> I have heard him relate, was an Iriſh painter, whom he knew at Birmingham, and who had practiſed his own precepts of oeconomy for ſeveral years in the Britiſh capital. He aſſured Johnſon, who, I ſuppoſe, was then meditating to try his fortune in London, but was apprehenſive of the expence, <q rend="inline">"that thirty pounds a year was enough to enable a man to live there without being contemptible. He allowed ten pounds for clothes and linen. He ſaid a man might live in a garret at eighteen-pence a week; few people would inquire where he lodged; and if they did, it was eaſy to ſay, 'Sir, I am to be found at ſuch a place.' By ſpending three-pence in a coffee-houſe, he might be for ſome hours every day in very good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; he might dine for ſix-pence, breakfaſt on bread and milk for a penny, and do without ſupper. On <hi>clean-ſhirt-day</hi> he went abroad, and paid viſits."</q> I have heard him more than once talk of this frugal friend, whom he recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected with eſteem and kindneſs, and did not like to have any one ſmile at the recital. <q rend="inline">"This man (ſaid he, gravely,) was a very ſenſible man, who perfectly underſtood common affairs: a man of a great deal of knowledge of the world, freſh from life, not ſtrained through books. He borrowed a horſe and ten pounds at Birmingham. Finding himſelf maſter of ſo much money, he ſet off for Weſt Cheſter, in order to get to Ireland. He returned the horſe, and probably the ten pounds too, after he got home."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Conſidering Johnſon's narrow circumſtances in the early part of his life, and particularly at the intereſting aera of his launching into the ocean of London, it is not to be wondered at, that an actual inſtance, proved by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of the poſſibility of enjoying the intellectual luxury of ſocial life, upon a very ſmall income, ſhould deeply engage his attention, and be ever recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0548300101:79" rendition="simple:additions"/> by him as a circumſtance of much importance. He amuſed himſelf, I remember, by computing how much more expence was abſolutely neceſſary to live upon the ſame ſcale with that which his friend deſcribed, when the value of money was diminiſhed by the progreſs of commerce. It may be eſtimated that double the money might now with difficulty be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Amidſt this cold obſcurity, there was one brilliant circumſtance to cheer him; he was well acquainted with Mr. Henry Hervey, one of the branches of the noble family of that name, who had been quartered at Lichfield as an officer of the army, and had at this time a houſe in London, where Johnſon was frequently entertained, and had an opportunity of meeting genteel company. Not very long before his death, he mentioned this, among other particulars of his life, which he was kindly communicating to me; and he deſcribed this early friend <q rend="inline">"Harry Hervey,"</q> thus: <q rend="inline">"He was a vicious man, but very kind to me. If you call a dog HERVEY, I ſhall love him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told me he had now written only three acts of his IRENE, and that he retired for ſome time to lodgings at Greenwich, where he proceeded in it ſomewhat farther, and uſed to compoſe, walking in the Park; but did not ſtay long enough at that place to finiſh it.</p>
               <p>At this period we find the following letter from him to Mr. Edward Cave, which, as a link in the chain of his literary hiſtory, it is proper to inſert:

                        <p>HAVING obſerved in your papers very uncommon offers of encouragement to men of letters, I have choſen, being a ſtranger in London, to communicate to you the following deſign, which, I hope, if you join in it, will be of advantage to both of us.</p>
                        <p>The Hiſtory of the Council of Trent having been lately tranſlated into French, and publiſhed with large Notes by Dr. Le Courayer, the reputation of that book is ſo much revived in England, that, it is preſumed, a new tranſlation of it from the Italian, together with Le Courayer's Notes from the French, could not fail of a favourable reception.</p>
                        <p>If it be anſwered, that the Hiſtory is already in Engliſh, it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that there was the ſame objection againſt Le Courayer's undertaking, with this diſadvantage, that the French had a verſion by one of their beſt tranſlators, whereas you cannot read three pages of the Engliſh Hiſtory
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0548300101:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without diſcovering that the ſtyle is capable of great improvements; but whether thoſe improvements are to be expected from this attempt, you muſt judge from the ſpecimen, which, if you approve the propoſal, I ſhall ſubmit to your examination.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe the merit of the verſions equal, we may hope that the addition of the Notes will turn the balance in our favour, conſidering the reputation of the Annotator.</p>
                        <p>Be pleaſed to favour me with a ſpeedy anſwer, if you are not willing to engage in this ſcheme; and appoint me a day to wait upon you, if you are. I am, Sir,</p>
                        <closer>

               <p>It ſhould ſeem from this letter, though ſubſcribed with his own name, that he had not yet been introduced to Mr. Cave. We ſhall preſently ſee what was done in conſequence of the propoſal which it contains.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the ſummer he returned to Lichfield, where he had left Mrs. Johnſon, and there he at laſt finiſhed his tragedy, which was not executed with his rapidity of compoſition upon other occaſions, but was ſlowly and painfully elaborated. A few days before his death, while burning a great maſs of papers, he picked out from among them the original unformed ſketch of this tragedy, in his own hand-writing, and gave it to Mr. Langton, by whoſe favour a copy of it is now in my poſſeſſion. It contains fragments of the intended plot, and ſpeeches for the different perſons of the drama, partly in the raw materials of proſe, partly worked up into verſe; as alſo a variety of hints for illuſtration borrowed from the Greek, Roman, and modern writers. The hand-writing is very difficult to be read, even by thoſe who were beſt acquainted with Johnſon's mode of penmanſhip, which at all times was very particular. The King having graciouſly accepted of this manuſcript as a literary curioſity, Mr. Langton made a fair and diſtinct copy of it, which he ordered to be bound up with the original and the printed tragedy; and the volume is depoſited in the King's library. His Majeſty was pleaſed to permit Mr. Langton to take a copy of it for himſelf.</p>

                     <hi>"that the Supreme Being will accept of virtue, whatever outward circumſtances it may be accompanied with, and may be delighted with varieties of worſhip;—but is anſwered, that variety cannot affect that Being, who

 infinitely happy in his own perfections, wants no external gratifications; nor can infinite truth be delighted with falſhood; that though he may guide or pity thoſe he leaves in darkneſs, he abandons thoſe who ſhut their eyes againſt the beams of day."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Johnſon's reſidence at Lichfield, on his return to it at this time, was only for three months; and as he had as yet ſeen but a ſmall part of the wonders of the metropolis, he had little to tell his townſmen. He related to me the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing minute anecdote of this period: <q rend="inline">"In the laſt age, when my mother lived in London, there were two ſets of people, thoſe who gave the wall, and thoſe who took it; the peaceable and the quarrelſome. When I returned to Lichfield, after having been in London, my mother aſked me, whether I was one of thoſe who gave the wall, or thoſe who took it. <hi>Now</hi> it is fixed that every man keeps to the right; or, if one is taking the wall, another yields it; and it is never a diſpute <note n="4" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 232.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He now removed to London with Mrs. Johnſon; but her daughter, who had lived with them at Edial, was left with her relations in the country. His lodgings were for ſome time in Woodſtock-ſtreet, near Hanover-ſquare, and afterwards in Caſtle-ſtreet, near Cavendiſh-ſquare. As there is ſomething pleaſingly intereſting, to many, in tracing ſo great a man through all his different habitations, I ſhall, before this work is concluded, preſent my readers with an exact liſt of his lodgings and houſes, in order of time, which, in placid condeſcenſion to my reſpectful curioſity, he one evening dictated to me, but without ſpecifying how long he lived at each. In the progreſs of his life I ſhall have occaſion to mention ſome of them as connected with particular incidents, or with the writing of particular parts of his works. To ſome, this minute attention may appear trifling; but when we conſider the punctilious exactneſs with which the different houſes in which Milton reſided have been traced by the writers of his life, a ſimilar enthuſiaſm may be pardoned in the biographer of Johnſon.</p>
               <p>His tragedy being by this time, as he thought, completely finiſhed and fit for the ſtage, he was very deſirous that it ſhould be brought forward. Mr. Peter Garrick told me, that Johnſon and he went together to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tavern, and read it over, and that he afterwards ſolicited Mr. Fleetwood, the patentee of Drury-lane theatre, to have it acted at his houſe; but Mr. Fleetwood would not accept it, probably becauſe it was not patroniſed by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0548300101:84"/>
ſome man of high rank; and it was not acted till 1749, when his friend David <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1738. Aetat. 29."/> Garrick was manager of that theatre.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE,"</q> begun and carried on by Mr. Edward Cave, under the name of SYLVANUS URBAN, had attracted the notice and eſteem of Johnſon, in an eminent degree, before he came to London as an adventurer in literature. He told me, that when he firſt ſaw St. John's Gate, the place where that deſervedly popular miſcellany was originally printed, he <q rend="inline">"beheld it with reverence."</q> I ſuppoſe, indeed, that every young authour has had the ſame kind of feeling for the magazine or periodical pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication which has firſt entertained him, and in which he has firſt had an opportunity to ſee himſelf in print, without the riſk of expoſing his name. I myſelf recollect ſuch impreſſions from <q rend="inline">"THE SCOTS MAGAZINE,"</q> which was begun at Edinburgh in the year 1739, and has been ever conducted with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accuracy, and propriety. I yet cannot help thinking of it with an affectionate regard. Johnſon has dignified the Gentleman's Magazine, by the importance with which he inveſts the life of Cave; but he has given it ſtill greater luſtre by the various admirable Eſſays which he wrote for it.</p>
               <p>Though Johnſon was often ſolicited by his friends to make a complete liſt of his writings, and talked of doing it, I believe with a ſerious intention that they ſhould all be collected on his own account, he put it off from year to year, and at laſt died without having done it perfectly. I have one in his own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, which contains a certain number; I indeed doubt if he could have recollected every one of them, as they were ſo numerous, ſo various, and ſcattered in ſuch a multiplicity of unconnected publications; nay, ſeveral of them publiſhed under the names of other perſons, to whom he liberally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed from the abundance of his mind. We muſt, therefore, be content to diſcover them, partly from occaſional information given by him to his friends, and partly from internal evidence <note n="5" place="bottom">While in the courſe of my narrative I enumerate his writings, I ſhall take care that my readers ſhall not be left to waver in doubt, between certainty and conjecture, with regard to their authenticity; and, for that purpoſe, ſhall mark with an <hi>aſteriſk</hi> (*) thoſe which he acknowledged to his friends, and with a <hi>dagger</hi> (†) thoſe which are aſcertained to be his by internal evidence.

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0548300101:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>It appears that he was now enliſted by Mr. Cave as a regular coadjutor in his magazine, by which he probably obtained a tolerable livelihood. At what time, or by what means, he had acquired a competent knowledge both of French and Italian, I do not know; but he was ſo well ſkilled in them, as to be ſufficiently qualified for a tranſlator. That part of his labour which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in emendation and improvement of the productions of other contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butors, like that employed in levelling ground, can be perceived only by thoſe who had an opportunity of comparing the original with the altered copy. What we certainly know to have been done by him in this way, was the Debates in both houſes of Parliament, under the name of <q rend="inline">"The Senate of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0548300101:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> Lilliput,"</q> ſometimes with feigned denominations of the ſeveral ſpeakers, ſometimes with denominations formed of the letters of their real names, in the manner of what is called anagram, ſo that they might eaſily be decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered. Parliament then kept the preſs in a kind of myſterious awe, which made it neceſſary to have recourſe to ſuch devices. In our time it has acquired an unreſtrained freedom, ſo that the people in all parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have a fair, open, and exact report of the actual proceedings of their repreſentatives and legiſlators; which in our conſtitution is highly to be valued, though, unqueſtionably, there has of late been too much reaſon to complain of the petulance with which obſcure ſcribblers have preſumed to treat men of the moſt reſpectable character and ſituation.</p>
               <p>This important article of the Gentleman's Magazine was, for ſeveral years, executed by Mr. William Guthrie, a man who deſerves to be reſpectably recorded in the literary annals of this country. He was deſcended of an ancient family in Scotland; but having a ſmall patrimony, and being an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the unfortunate houſe of Stuart, he could not accept of any office in the ſtate; he therefore came to London, and employed his talents and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as an <q rend="inline">"Authour by profeſſion."</q> His writings in hiſtory, criticiſm, and politicks, had conſiderable merit <note n="7" place="bottom">How much poetry he wrote, I know not; but he informed me, that he was the authour of the beautiful little piece, <q rend="inline">"The Eagle and Robin Redbreaſt,"</q> in the collection of poems entitled <q rend="inline">"THE UNION,"</q> though it is there ſaid to be written by Archibald Scott, before the year 1600.</note>. He was the firſt Engliſh hiſtorian who had recourſe to that authentick ſource of information, the Parliamentary Journals; and ſuch was the power of his political pen, that, at an early period, government thought it worth their while to keep it quiet by a penſion, which he enjoyed till his death. Johnſon eſteemed him enough to wiſh that his life ſhould be written. The debates in Parliament, which were brought home and digeſted by Guthrie, whoſe memory, though ſurpaſſed by others who have ſince followed him in the ſame department, was yet very quick and tenacious, were ſent by Cave to Johnſon for his reviſion; and, after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, when Guthrie had attained to greater variety of employment, and the ſpeeches were more and more enriched by the acceſſion of Johnſon's genius it was reſolved that he ſhould do the whole himſelf, from the ſcanty notes furniſhed by perſons employed to attend in both houſes of Parliament. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, however, as he himſelf told me, he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had nothing more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him but the names of the ſeveral ſpeakers, and the part which they had taken in the debate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0548300101:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus was Johnſon employed, during ſome of the beſt years of his life, as a mere literary labourer <q rend="inline">"for gain, not glory,"</q> ſolely to obtain an honeſt ſupport. He however indulged himſelf in occaſional little ſallies, which the French ſo happily expreſs by the term <hi>jeux d'eſprit,</hi> and which will be noticed in their order, in the progreſs of this work.</p>
               <p>But what firſt diſplayed his tranſcendent powers, and <q rend="inline">"gave the world aſſurance of the MAN,"</q> was his <q rend="inline">"LONDON, a Poem, in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal,"</q> which came out in May this year, and burſt forth with a ſplendour, the rays of which will for ever encircle his name. Boileau had imitated the ſame ſatire with great ſucceſs, applying it to Paris; but an attentive compariſon will ſatisfy every reader, that he is much excelled by the Engliſh Juvenal. Oldham had alſo imitated it, and applied it to London; all which performances concur to prove, that great cities, in every age, and in every country, will furniſh ſimilar topicks of ſatire. Whether Johnſon had previouſly read Oldham's imitation, I do not know; but it is not a little remarkable, that there is ſcarcely any coincidence found between the two performances, though upon the very ſame ſubject. The only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are, in deſcribing London as the <hi>ſink</hi> of foreign worthleſſneſs:
<q>
                     <l>"—<hi>the</hi> common ſhore,</l>

                  </q>

and,

               <p>The particulars which Oldham has collected, both as exhibiting the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of London, and of the times, contraſted with better days, are different from thoſe of Johnſon, and in general well choſen, and well expreſt <note n="8" place="bottom">

 There are, in Oldham's imitation, many proſaick verſes and bad rhymes, and his poem ſets out with a ſtrange inadvertent blunder:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Tho' much concern'd to <hi>leave</hi> my dear old friend,</l>
                     <l>"I muſt, however, <hi>his</hi> deſign commend</l>
                     <l>"Of fixing in the country.—"</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>It is plain he was not going to leave his <hi>friend;</hi> his friend was going to leave <hi>him.</hi> A young lady at once corrected this with good critical ſagacity to
<q>
                     <l>"Tho' much concern'd to <hi>loſe</hi> my dear old friend."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There is one paſſage in the original, better transfuſed by Oldham than by Johnſon:
<q>
                     <l>"Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in ſe,</l>
                     <l>"Quàm quod ridiculos homines facit."</l>
                  </q>
which is an exquiſite remark on the galling meanneſs and contempt annexed to poverty: JOHNSON'S imitation is,
<q>
                     <l>"Of all the griefs that harraſs the diſtreſt,</l>
                     <l>"Sure the moſt bitter is a fcornful jeſt."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>OLDHAM'S, though leſs elegant, is more juſt:
<q>
                     <l>"Nothing in poverty ſo ill is borne,</l>
                     <l>"As its expoſing men to grinning ſcorn."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Where, or in what manner this poem was compoſed, I am ſorry that I neglected to aſcertain, with precision, from Johnſon's own authority. He has marked upon his corrected copy of the firſt edition of it, <q rend="inline">"Written in 1738;"</q> and, as it was publiſhed in the month of May in that year, it is evident that much time was not employed in preparing it for the preſs. The hiſtory of its publication I am enabled to give in a very ſatisfactory manner; and judging from myſelf; and many of my friends, I truſt that it will not be unintereſting to my readers.</p>

We may be certain, though it is not expreſsly named in the following letters to Mr. Cave in 1738, that they all relate to it:

                        <p>WHEN I took the liberty of writing to you a few days ago, I did not expect a repetition of the ſame pleaſure ſo ſoon; for a pleaſure I ſhall always think it, to converſe in any manner with an ingenious and candid man; but having the incloſed poem in my hands to diſpoſe of for the benefit of the authour, (of whoſe abilities I ſhall ſay nothing, ſince I ſend you his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,) I believed I could not procure more advantageous terms from any perſon than from you, who have ſo much diſtinguiſhed yourſelf by your generous encouragement of poetry; and whoſe judgement of that art nothing but your commendation of my trifle<note n="9" place="bottom">His Ode <q rend="inline">"Ad Urbanum"</q> probably. N.</note> can give me any occaſion to call in queſtion. I do not doubt but you will look over this poem with another eye, and reward it in a different manner, from a mercenary bookſeller, who counts the lines he is to purchaſe, and conſiders nothing but the bulk. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help taking notice, that, beſides what the authour may hope for on account of his abilities, he has likewiſe another claim to your regard, as he lies at preſent under very diſadvantageous circumſtances of fortune. I beg, therefore, that you will favour me with a letter to-morrow, that I may know what you can afford to allow him, that he may either part with it to you, or find out (which I do not expect) ſome other way more to his ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>I have only to add, that as I am ſenſible I have tranſcribed it very coarſely, which, after having altered it, I was obliged to do, I will, if you pleaſe to tranſmit the ſheets from the preſs, correct it for you; and take the trouble of altering any ſtroke of ſatire which you may diſlike.</p>
                        <p>By exerting on this occaſion your uſual generoſity, you will not only encourage learning, and relieve diſtreſs, but (though it be in compariſon of the other motives of very ſmall account) oblige in a very ſenſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Sir,</p>

I propoſe, if my calculation be near the truth, to engage for the reimburſement of all that you ſhall loſe by an impreſſion of 500, provided, as you very generouſly propoſe, that the profit, if any, be ſet aſide for the authour's uſe, excepting the preſent you made, which, if he be a gainer, it is fit he ſhould repay. I beg that you will let one of your ſervants write an exact account of the expence of ſuch an impreſſion, and ſend it with the poem, that I may know what I engage for. I am very ſenſible, from your generoſity on this occaſion, of your regard to learning, even in its unhappieſt ſtate, and cannot but think ſuch a temper deſerving of the gratitude of thoſe who ſuffer ſo often from a contrary diſpoſition.

               <p>To us who have long known the manly force, bold ſpirit, and maſterly verſification of this poem, it is a matter of curioſity to obſerve the diffidence with which its authour brought it forward into publick notice, while he is ſo cautious as not to avow it to be his own production; and with what humility he offers to allow the printer to <q rend="inline">"alter any ſtroke of ſatire which he might diſlike."</q> That any ſuch alteration was made, we do not know. If we did, we could not but feel an indignant regret; but how painful is it to ſee that a writer of ſuch vigourous powers of mind was actually in ſuch diſtreſs, that the ſmall profit which ſo ſhort a poem, however excellent, could yield, was courted as a <q rend="inline">"relief."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It has been generally ſaid, I know not with what truth, that Johnſon offered his <q rend="inline">"LONDON"</q> to ſeveral bookſellers, none of whom would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it. To this circumſtance Mr. Derrick alludes in the following lines of his <q rend="inline">"FORTUNE, A RHAPSODY:"</q>

                     <l> "Will no kind patron JOHNSON own?</l>
                     <l>"Shall JOHNSON friendleſs range the town?</l>

               <p>But we have ſeen that the worthy, modeſt, and ingenious Mr. Robert Dodſley had taſte enough to perceive its uncommon merit, and thought it creditable to have a ſhare in it. The fact is, that, at a future conference, he bargained for the whole property of it, for which he gave Johnſon ten guineas, who told me, <q rend="inline">"I might, perhaps, have accepted of leſs; but that Paul Whitehead had a little before got ten guineas for a poem; and I would not take leſs than Paul Whitehead."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I may here obſerve, that Johnſon appeared to me to undervalue Paul Whitehead upon every occaſion when he was mentioned, and, in my opinion, did not do him juſtice; but when it is conſidered that Paul Whitehead was a member of a riotous and profane club, we may account for Johnſon's having a prejudice againſt him. Paul Whitehead was, indeed, unfortunate in being not only ſlighted by Johnſon, but violently attacked by Churchill, who utters the following imprecation:
<q>
                     <l>"May I (can worſe diſgrace on manhood fall?)</l>
                     <l>"Be born a Whitehead, and baptiz'd a Paul!"</l>
                  </q>
yet I ſhall never be perſuaded to think meanly of the authour of ſo brilliant and pointed a ſatire as <q rend="inline">"MANNERS."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"London"</q> was publiſhed in May, 1738 <note n="2" place="bottom">Sir John Hawkins, p. 86, tells us <q rend="inline">"The event is <hi>antedated,</hi> in the poem of 'London;' but in every particular, except the difference of a year, what is there ſaid of the departùre of Thales, muſt be underſtood of Savage, and looked upon as <hi>true hiſtory."</hi>
                     </q> This conjecture is, I believe, entirely groundleſs. I have been aſſured, that Johnſon ſaid he was not ſo much as acquainted with Savage when he wrote his <q rend="inline">"London."</q> If the departure mentioned in it was the departure of Savage; the event was not <hi>antedated</hi> but <hi>foreſeen;</hi> for <q rend="inline">"London"</q> was publiſhed in May, 1738, and Savage did not ſet out for Wales till July, 1739. However well Johnſon could defend the credibility of <hi>ſecond ſight,</hi> he did not pretend that he himſelf was poſſeſſed of that faculty.</note>; and it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that it came out on the ſame morning with Pope's ſatire, entitled <q rend="inline">"1738;"</q> ſo that England had at once is Juvenal and Horace as poetical monitors. The Reverend Dr. Douglas, now Biſhop of Carliſle, to whom I am indebted for ſome obliging communications, was then a ſtudent at
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0548300101:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Oxford, and remembers well the effect which <q rend="inline">"London"</q> produced. Every body was delighted with it; and there being no name to it, the firſt buz of the literary circles was <q rend="inline">"here is an unknown poet, greater even than Pope."</q> And it is recorded in the Gentleman's Magazine of that year <note n="3" place="bottom">P. 269.</note>, that it <q rend="inline">"got to the ſecond edition in the courſe of a week."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the warmeſt patrons of this poem on its firſt appearance was General OGLETHORPE, whoſe <q rend="inline">"ſtrong benevolence of ſoul"</q> was unabated during the courſe of a very long life; though it is painful to think, that he had but too much reaſon to become cold and callous, and diſcontented with the world, from the neglect which he experienced of his publick and private worth, by thoſe in whoſe power it was to gratify ſo gallant a veteran with marks of diſtinction. This extraordinary perſon was as remarkable for his learning and taſte, as for his other eminent qualities; and no man was more prompt, active, and generous in encouraging merit. I have heard Johnſon gratefully acknowledge, in his preſence, the kind and effectual ſupport which he gave to his <q rend="inline">"London,"</q> though unacquainted with its authour.</p>
               <p>POPE, who then filled the poetical throne without a rival, it may reaſonably be preſumed, muſt have been particularly ſtruck by the ſudden appearance of ſuch a poet; and, to his credit, let it be remembered, that his feelings and conduct on the occaſion were candid and liberal. He requeſted Mr. Richardſon, ſon of the painter, to endeavour to find out who this new authour was. Mr. Richardſon, after ſome inquiry, having informed him that he had diſcovered only that his name was Johnſon, and that he was ſome obſcure man, Pope ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He will ſoon be <hi>deterré</hi> 
                     <note n="4" place="bottom">Sir Joſhua Reynolds, from the information of the younger Richardſon.</note>."</q> We ſhall preſently ſee, from a note written by Pope, that he was himſelf afterwards more ſucceſsful in his inquiries than his friend.</p>
               <p>That in this juſtly-celebrated poem may be found a few rhymes which the critical preciſion of Engliſh proſody at this day would diſallow, cannot be denied; but with this ſmall imperfection, which in the general blaze of its excellence is not perceived, till the mind has ſubſided into cool attention, it is, undoubtedly, one of the nobleſt productions in our language, both for ſentiment and expreſſion. The nation was then in that ferment againſt the court and the miniſtry, which ſome years after ended in the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole; and as it has been ſaid, that Tories are Whigs when out of place, and Whigs, Tories when in place; ſo, as a whig adminiſtration ruled with what force it could, a tory oppoſition had all the animation and all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0548300101:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 eloquence of reſiſtance to power, aided by the common topicks of patriotiſm, liberty, and independence! Accordingly, we find in Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"London"</q> the moſt ſpirited invectives againſt tyranny and oppreſſion, the warmeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for his own country, and the pureſt love of virtue; interſperſed with traits of his own particular character and ſituation, not omitting his prejudices as a <q rend="inline">"true-born Engliſhman <note n="5" place="bottom">It is, however, remarkable, that he uſes the epithet, which, undoubtedly, ſince the union between England and Scotland, ought to denominate the natives of both parts of our iſland:

                           <l>"Was early taught a BRITON'S rights to prize."</l>
                        </q>
                     </note>,"</q> not only againſt foreign countries, but againſt Ireland and Scotland. On ſome of theſe topicks I ſhall quote a few paſſages:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"The cheated nation's happy fav'rites ſee;</l>
                     <l>"Mark whom the great careſs, who frown on me."</l>
                     <l>"Has heaven reſerv'd, in pity to the poor,</l>
                     <l>"No pathleſs waſte, or undiſcover'd ſhore?</l>
                     <l>"No ſecret iſland in the boundleſs main?</l>
                     <l>"No peaceful deſart yet unclaim'd by Spain?</l>
                     <l>"Quick let us riſe, the happy ſeats explore,</l>
                     <l>"And bear Oppreſſion's inſolence no more."</l>
                     <l>"How, when competitors like theſe contend,</l>
                     <l>"Can <hi>ſurly Virtue</hi> hope to fix a friend?"</l>
                     <l>"This mournful truth is every where confeſs'd,</l>
                     <l>"SLOW RISES WORTH, BY POVERTY DEPRESS'D!"</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>We may eaſily conceive with what feeling a great mind like his, cramped and galled by narrow circumſtances, uttered this laſt line, which he marked by capitals. The whole of the poem is eminently excellent, and there are in it ſuch proofs of a knowledge of the world, and of a mature acquaintance with life, as cannot be contemplated without wonder, when we conſider that he was then only in his twenty-ninth year, and had yet been ſo little in the <q rend="inline">"buſy haunts of men."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, while we admire the poetical excellence of this poem, candour obliges us to allow, that the flame of patriotiſm and zeal for popular reſiſtance with which it is fraught, had no juſt cauſe. There was, in truth, <hi>no</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"oppreſſion;"</q> the <q rend="inline">"nation"</q> was <hi>not</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"cheated."</q> Sir Robert Walpole was a wiſe and a benevolent miniſter, who thought that the happineſs and proſperity of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial country like ours, would be beſt promoted by peace, which he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0548300101:96"/>
accordingly maintained, with credit, during a very long period. Johnſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterwards honeſtly acknowledged the merit of Walpole, whom he called <q rend="inline">"a fixed ſtar;"</q> while he characteriſed his opponent, Pitt, as <q rend="inline">"a meteor."</q> But Johnſon's juvenile poem was naturally impregnated with the fire of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and upon every account was univerſally admired.</p>
               <p>Though thus elevated into fame, and conſcious of uncommon powers, he had not that buſtling confidence, or, I may rather ſay, that animated ambition, which one might have ſuppoſed would have urged him to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at riſing in life. But ſuch was his inflexible dignity of character, that he could not ſtoop to court the great; without which, hardly any man has made his way to high ſtation. He could not expect to produce many ſuch works as his <q rend="inline">"LONDON,"</q> and he felt the hardſhip of writing for bread; he was, therefore, willing to reſume the office of a ſchoolmaſter, ſo as to have a ſure, though moderate income for his life; and an offer being made to him of a ſchool in Staffordſhire <note n="6" place="bottom">In a billet written by Mr. Pope in the following year, this ſchool is ſaid to have been in <hi>Shropſhire;</hi> but as it appears from a letter from Earl Gower, that the truſtees of it were <q rend="inline">"ſome worthy gentlemen in Johnſon's neighbourhood,"</q> I conclude that Pope muſt have, by miſtake, written Shropſhire inſtead of Staffordſhire.</note>, provided he could obtain the degree of Maſter of Arts, Dr. Adams was applied to, by a common friend, to know whether that could be granted him as a favour from the Univerſity of Oxford. But though he had made ſuch a figure in the literary world, it was then thought too great a favour to be aſked.</p>
               <p>Pope, without any knowledge of him but from his <q rend="inline">"London,"</q> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to Earl Gower, who endeavoured to procure for him a degree from Dublin, by the following letter to a friend of Dean Swift:

                        <p>MR. SAMUEL JOHNSON (author of <hi>London,</hi> a ſatire, and ſome other poetical pieces) is a native of this county, and much reſpected by ſome worthy gentlemen in his neighbourhood, who are truſtees of a charity ſchool now vacant; the certain ſalary is ſixty pounds a year, of which they are deſirous to make him maſter; but, unfortunately, he is not capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their bounty, which <hi>would make him happy for life,</hi> by not being a <hi>Maſter of Arts;</hi> which, by the ſtatutes of this ſchool, the maſter of it muſt be.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe gentlemen do me the honour to think that I have intereſt enough in you, to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift, to perſuade the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0548300101:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> Univerſity of Dublin to ſend a diploma to me, conſtituting this poor man Maſter of Arts in their Univerſity. They highly extol the man's learning and probity; and will not be perſuaded, that the Univerſity will make any difficulty of conferring ſuch a favour upon a ſtranger, if he is recommended by the Dean. They ſay he is not afraid of the ſtricteſt examination, though he is of ſo long a journey; and will venture it, if the Dean thinks it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; chooſing rather to die upon the road, <hi>than be ſtarved to death in tranſlating for bookſellers;</hi> which has been his only ſubſiſtence for ſome time paſt.</p>
                        <p>I fear there is more difficulty in this affair, than thoſe good-natured gentlemen apprehend; eſpecially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the 11th of next month. If you ſee this matter in the ſame light that it appears to me, I hope you will burn this, and pardon me for giving you ſo much trouble about an impracticable thing; but, if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour aſked, I am ſure your humanity, and propenſity to relieve merit in diſtreſs, will incline you to ſerve the poor man, without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you, than aſſuring you that I am, with great truth, Sir,</p>

               <p>It was, perhaps no ſmall diſappointment to Johnſon that this reſpectable application had not the deſired effect; yet how much reaſon has there been, both for himſelf and his country, to rejoice that it did not ſucceed, as he might probably have waſted in obſcurity thoſe hours in which he afterwards produced his incomparable works.</p>
               <p>About this time he made one other effort to emancipate himſelf from the drudgery of authourſhip. He applied to Dr. Adams, to conſult Dr. Smalbroke of the Commons, whether a perſon might be permitted to practice as an advocate there, without a doctor's degree in Civil Law. <q rend="inline">"I am (ſaid he) a total ſtranger to theſe ſtudies; but whatever is a profeſſion, and maintains numbers, muſt be within the reach of common abilities, and ſome degree of induſtry."</q> Dr. Adams was much pleaſed with Johnſon's deſign to employ his talents in that manner, being confident he would have attained to great eminence. And, indeed, I cannot conceive a man better qualified to make a diſtinguiſhed figure as a lawyer; for, he would have brought to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion a rich ſtore of various knowledge, an uncommon acuteneſs, and a command of language, in which few could have equalled, and none have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0548300101:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſurpaſſed him. He who could diſplay eloquence and wit in defence of the deciſion of the Houſe of Commons upon Mr. Wilkes's election for Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, and of the unconſtitutional taxation of our fellow ſubjects in America, muſt have been a powerful advocate in any cauſe. But here, alſo, the want of a degree was an inſurmountable bar.</p>
               <p>He was, therefore, under the neceſſity of perſevering in that courſe, into which he had been forced; and we find, that his propoſal from Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich to Mr. Cave, for a tranſlation of Father Paul Sarpi's Hiſtory, was accepted <note n="7" place="bottom">In the Weekly Miſcellany, October 21, 1738, there appeared the following advertiſement: <q rend="inline">"Juſt publiſhed, Propoſals for printing the Hiſtory of the Council of Trent, tranſlated from the Italian of Father Paul Sarpi; with the Authour's Life, and Notes theological, hiſtorical, and critical, from the French edition of Dr. Le Courayer. To which are added, Obſervations on the Hiſtory, and Notes and Illuſtrations from various Authours, both printed and manuſcript. By S. Johnſon. 1. The work will conſiſt of two hundred ſheets, and be two volumes in quarto, printed on good paper and letter. 2. The price will be 18<hi>s.</hi> each volume, to be paid, half a guinea at the time of ſubſcribing, half a guinea at the delivery of the firſt volume, and the reſt at the delivery of the ſecond volume in ſheets. 3. Two-pence to be abated for every ſheet leſs than two hundred. It may be had on a large paper, in three volumes, at the price of three guineas; one to be paid at the time of ſubſcribing, another at the delivery of the firſt, and the reſt at the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the other volumes. The work is now in the preſs, and will be diligently proſecuted.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Some ſheets of this tranſlation were printed off, but the deſign was dropt; for it happened, oddly enough, that another perſon of the name of Samuel Johnſon, Librarian of St. Martin's in the Fields, and Curate of that pariſh, engaged in the ſame undertaking, and was patroniſed by the Clergy, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by Dr. Pearce, afterwards Biſhop of Rocheſter. Several light ſkirmiſhes paſſed between the rival tranſlators, in the newſpapers of the day; and the conſequence was, that they deſtroyed each other, for neither of them went on with the work. It is much to be regretted, that the able performance of that celebrated genius FRA PAOLO, loſt the advantage of being incorporated into Britiſh literature by the maſterly hand of Johnſon.</p>
               <p>I have in my poſſeſſion, by the favour of Mr. John Nichols, a paper in Johnſon's hand-writing, entitled <q rend="inline">"Account between Mr. Edward Cave and Sam.

                     <p>I AM pretty much of your opinion, that the Commentary cannot be proſecuted with any appearance of ſucceſs; for as the names of the authours concerned are of more weight in the performance than its own intrinſick merit, the publick will be ſoon ſatisfied with it. And I think the Examen ſhould be puſhed forward with the utmoſt expedition. Thus, 'This day, &amp;c. An Examen of Mr. Pope's Eſſay, &amp;c. containing a ſuccinct Account of the Philoſophy of Mr. Leibnitz on the Syſtem of the Fataliſts, with a Confutation of their Opinions, and an Illuſtration of the Doctrine of Free-will;' [with what elſe you think proper].</p>
                     <p>It will, above all, be neceſſary to take notice, that it is a thing diſtinct from the Commentary.</p>

               <p>But although he correſponded with Mr. Cave concerning a tranſlation of Crouſaz's Examen of Pope's Eſſay on Man, and gave advice as one anxious for its ſucceſs, I was long ago conivnced by a peruſal of the Preface,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0548300101:101"/> that this tranſlation was erroneouſly aſcribed to him; and I have found this point aſcertained, beyond all doubt, by the following article in Dr. Birch's Manuſcripts in the Britiſh Muſeum:

               <p>Indeed Mrs. Carter has lately acknowledged to Mr. Seward, that ſhe was the tranſlator of the Examen.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that Johnſon's laſt quoted letter to Mr. Cave concludes with a fair confeſſion that he had not a dinner; and it is no leſs remarkable, that, though in this ſtate of want himſelf, his benevolent heart was not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the neceſſities of an humble labourer in literature, as appears from the very next letter:

               <p>I muſt not omit to mention, that this Mr. Macbean was a native of Scotland.</p>
               <p>In the Gentleman's Magazine of this year, Johnſon gave a Life of Father Paul; * and he wrote the Preface to the Volume, † which, though prefixed to it when bound, is always publiſhed with the Appendix, and is therefore the laſt compoſition belonging to it. The ability and nice adaptation with which he sould draw up a prefatory addreſs, was one of his peculiar excellencies.</p>

It appears too, that he paid a friendly attention to Mrs. Elizabeth Carter; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1739.

            <div n="1739" type="year">
               <p>In 1739, beſide the aſſiſtance which he gave to the Parliamentary Debates, his writings in the Gentleman's Magazine were, <q rend="inline">"The Life of Boerhaave, *"</q> in which it is to be obſerved, that he diſcovers that love of chymiſtry which never forſook him; <q rend="inline">"An Appeal to the Publick in behalf of the Editor; †"</q>

Were there no poſitive teſtimony as to this point, the ſtyle of the performance, and the name of Shakſpeare not being mentioned in an Eſſay profeſſedly reviewing the principal Engliſh poets, would aſcertain it not to be the production of Johnſon. But
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0548300101:103"/>
 there is here no occaſion to reſort to internal evidence; for my Lord Biſhop of Carliſle has aſſured me, that it was written by Guthrie. His ſeparate pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications were, <q rend="inline">"A Complete Vindication of the Licenſers of the Stage, from the malicious and ſcandalous Aſperſions of Mr. Brooke, Authour of Guſtavus Vaſa, *"</q> being an ironical Attack upon them for their Suppreſſion of that Tragedy; and, <q rend="inline">"Marmor Norfolcienſe; or an Eſſay on an ancient prophetical Inſcription in monkiſh Rhyme, lately diſcovered near Lynne in Norfolk, by PROBUS BRITANNICUS. *"</q> In this performance, he, in a feigned inſcription, ſuppoſed to have been found in Norfolk, the county of Sir Robert Walpole, then the obnoxious prime miniſter of this country, inveighs againſt the Brunſwick ſucceſſion, and the meaſures of government conſequent upon it. To this ſuppoſed prophecy he added a Commentary, making each expreſſion apply to the times, with warm Anti-Hanoverian zeal.</p>
               <p>This anonymous pamphlet, I believe, did not make ſo much noiſe as was expected, and, therefore, had not a very extenſive circulation. Sir John Hawkins relates, that <q rend="inline">"warrants were iſſued, and meſſengers employed to apprehend the authour; who, though he had forborne to ſubſcribe his name to the pamphlet, the vigilance of thoſe in purſuit of him had diſcovered;"</q> and we are informed, that he lay concealed in Lambeth-marſh till the ſcent after him grew cold. This, however, is altogether without foundation; for Mr. Steele, one of the Secretaries of the Treaſury, who, amidſt a variety of important buſineſs, politely obliged me with his attention to my inquiry, informs me, that <q rend="inline">"he directed every poſſible ſearch to be made in the records of the Treaſury and Secretary of State's Office, but could find no trace whatever of any warrant having been iſſued to apprehend the authour of this pamphlet."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Marmor Norfolcienſe"</q> became exceedingly ſcarce, ſo that I, for many years, endeavoured in vain to procure a copy of it. At laſt I was indebted to the malice of one of Johnſon's numerous petty adverſaries, who, in 1775, publiſhed a new edition of it, <q rend="inline">"with Notes and a Dedication to SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D. by TRIBUNUS;"</q> in which ſome puny ſcribbler invidiouſly attempted to found upon it a charge of inconſiſtency againſt its authour, becauſe he had accepted of a penſion from his preſent Majeſty, and had written in ſupport of the meaſures of government. As a mortification to ſuch impotent malice, of which there are ſo many inſtances towards men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, I am happy to relate, that this <hi>telum imbelle</hi> did not reach its exalted object, till about a year after it thus appeared, when I mentioned it to him, ſuppoſing that he knew of the re-publication. To my ſurprize, he had not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0548300101:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet heard of it. He requeſted me to go directly and get it for him, which I  did. He looked at it and laughed, and ſeemed to be much diverted with the feeble efforts of his unknown adverſary, who, I hope, is alive to read this account. <q rend="inline">"Now (ſaid he) here is ſomebody who thinks he has vexed me ſadly; yet, if it had not been for you, you rogue, I ſhould probably never have ſeen it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As Mr. Pope's note concerning Johnſon, alluded to in a former page, refers both to his <q rend="inline">"London,"</q> and his <q rend="inline">"Marmor Norfolcienſe,"</q> I have deferred inſerting it till now. I am indebted for it to Dr. Percy, the Biſhop of Dromore, who permitted me to copy it from the original in his poſſeſſion. It was preſented to his Lordſhip by Sir Joſhua Reynolds, to whom it was given by the ſon of Mr. Richardſon the painter, the perſon to whom it is addreſſed. I have tranſcribed it with minute exactneſs, that the peculiar mode of writing, and imperfect ſpelling of that celebrated poet, may be exhibited to the curious in literature. It juſtifies Swift's epithet of <q rend="inline">"paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparing Pope,"</q> for it is written on a ſlip no larger than a common meſſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card, and was ſent to Mr. Richardſon, along with the Imitation of Juvenal.</p>

               <p>Johnſon had been told of this note by Pope; and Sir Joſhua Reynolds informed him of the compliment which it contained, but, from delicacy, avoided ſhewing him the paper itſelf.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0548300101:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 deſcription which Sydenham gives of that diſeaſe. <q rend="inline">"This diſorder is a kind of convulſion.

If the hand of the ſame ſide be applied to the breaſt, or any other part of the body, he cannot keep it a moment in the ſame poſture, but it will be drawn into a different one by a convulſion, notwithſtanding all his efforts to the contrary."</q> Sir Joſhua Reynolds, however, is of a different opinion, and has favoured me with the following paper.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Thoſe motions or tricks of Dr. Johnſon are improperly called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. He could ſit motionleſs, when he was told ſo to do, as well as any other man; my opinion is, that it proceeded from a habit he had indulged himſelf in, of accompanying his thoughts with certain untoward actions, and thoſe actions always appeared to me as if they were meant to reprobate ſome part of his paſt conduct. Whenever he was not engaged in converſation, ſuch thoughts were ſure to ruſh into his mind; and, for this reaſon, any company, any employment whatever, he preferred to being alone. The great buſineſs of his life (he ſaid) was to eſcape from himſelf; this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he conſidered as the diſeaſe of his mind, which nothing cured but company.</p>
                  <p>One inſtance of his abſence and particularity, as it is characteriſtick of the man, may be worth relating. When he and I took a journey together into the Weſt, we viſited the late Mr. Banks, of Dorſetſhire; the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation turning upon pictures, which Johnſon could not well ſee, he retired to a corner of the room, ſtretching out his right leg as far as he could reach before him, then bringing up his left leg, and ſtretching his right ſtill further on. The old gentleman obſerving him, went up to him, and in a very courteous manner aſſured him, that though it was not a new houſe, the floor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was perfectly ſafe. The Doctor ſtarted from his reverie, like a perſon waked out of his ſleep, but ſpoke not a word.</p>

               <p>While we are on this ſubject, my readers may not be diſpleaſed with another anecdote, communicated to me by the ſame friend, from the relation of Mr. Hogarth.</p>
               <p>Johnſon uſed to be a pretty frequent viſiter at the houſe of Mr. Richardſon, authour of Clariſſa, and other novels of extenſive reputation. Mr. Hogarth came one day to ſee Richardſon, ſoon after the execution of Dr. Cameron, for having taken arms for the houſe of Stuart in 1745-6; and being a warm partiſan of George the Second, he obſerved to Richardſon, that certainly there muſt have been ſome very unfavourable circumſtances lately diſcovered in this particular caſe, which had induced the King to approve of an execution
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0548300101:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for rebellion ſo long after the time when it was committed, as this had the  appearance of putting a man to death in cold blood <note n="6" place="bottom">Impartial poſterity may, perhaps, be as little inclined as Dr. Johnſon was to juſtify the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rigour exerciſed in the caſe of Dr. Archibald Cameron. He was an amiable and truly honeſt man; and his offence was owing to a generous, though miſtaken principle of duty. Being obliged, after 1746, to give up his profeſſion as a phyſician, and go into foreign parts, he was honoured with the rank of Colonel, both in the French and Spaniſh ſervice. He was a ſon of the ancient and reſpectable family of Cameron, of Lochiel; and his brother, who was the Chief of that brave clan, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by moderation and humanity, while the Highland army marched victorious through Scotland. It is remarkable of this Chief, that though he had earneſtly remonſtrated againſt the attempt as hopeleſs, he was of too heroick a ſpirit not to venture his life and fortune in the cauſe, when perſonally aſked by him whom he thought his Prince.</note>, and was very unlike his Majeſty's uſual clemency. While he was talking, he perceived a perſon ſtanding at a window in the room, ſhaking his head, and rolling himſelf about in a ſtrange ridiculous manner. He concluded that he was an ideot, whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardſon, as a very good man. To his great ſurprize, however, this figure ſtalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardſon were ſitting, and all at once took up the argument, and burſt out into an invective againſt George the Second, as one, who, upon all occaſions, was unrelenting and barbarous; mentioning many inſtances, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that when an officer of high rank had been acquitted by a Court Martial, George the Second had, with his own hand, ſtruck his name oſf the liſt. In ſhort, he diſplayed ſuch a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with aſtoniſhment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inſpired. Neither Hogarth nor Johnſon were made known to each other at this interview.</p>

This Epitaph is ſo exquiſitely beautiful, that I remember even Lord Kames, ſtrangely prejudiced as he was againſt Dr. Johnſon, was compelled to allow it very high praiſe. It has been aſcribed to Mr. Garrick, from its appearing at firſt with the ſignature G; but I have heard Mr. Garrick declare, that it was written by Dr. Johnſon, and give the following account of the manner in which it was compoſed. Johnſon and he were ſitting together; when, amongſt other things, Garrick repeated an Epitaph upon this Philips by a Dr. Wilkes, in theſe words:</p>

               <p>Johnſon ſhook his head at theſe common-place funereal lines, and ſaid to Garrick, <q rend="inline">"I think, Davy, I can make a better."</q> Then, ſtirring about his tea for a little while, in a ſtate of meditation, he almoſt extempore produced the following verſes:</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1741. Aetat. 32."/> In 1741 he wrote for the Gentleman's Magazine <q rend="inline">"the Preface, †"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Lives of Drake and Baretier, *"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"A free Tranſlation of the Jeſts of Hierocles, with an Introduction; †"</q> and, I think, the following pieces: <q rend="inline">"Debate on the Propoſal of Parliament to Cromwell, to aſſume the Title of King, abridged, methodiſed, and digeſted; †"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Tranſlation of Abbé Guyon's Diſſertation on the Amazons; †"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Tranſlation of Fontenelle's Panegyrick on Dr. Morin. †"</q> Two notes upon this appear to me undoubtedly his. He this year, and the two following, wrote the Parliamentary Debates. He told me himſelf, that he was the ſole compoſer of them for thoſe three years only.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0548300101:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He was not, however, preciſely exact in his ſtatement, which he mentioned  from haſty recollection; for it is ſufficiently evident, that his compoſition of them began November 19, 1740, and ended February 23, 1742-3.</p>
               <p>It appears from ſome of Cave's letters to Dr. Birch, that Cave had better aſſiſtance for that branch of his Magazine, than has been generally ſuppoſed; and that he was indefatigable in getting it made as perfect as he could.</p>
               <p>Thus, 21ſt July, 1735, <q rend="inline">"I trouble you with the incloſed, becauſe you ſaid you could eaſily correct what is herein given for Lord C—ld's ſpeech. I beg you will do ſo as ſoon as you can for me, becauſe the month is far advanced."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And, 15th July, 1737. <q rend="inline">"As you remember the Debates ſo far as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpeeches already printed are not exact, I beg the favour that you will peruſe the incloſed, and, in the beſt manner your memory will ſerve, correct the miſtaken paſſages, or add any thing that is omitted. I ſhould be very glad to have ſomething of the Duke of N—le's ſpeech, which would be particularly of ſervice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A gentleman has Lord Bathurſt's ſpeech to add ſomething to."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And, July 3, 1744, <q rend="inline">"You will ſee what ſtupid, low, abominable ſtuff is put<note n="7" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe in another compilation of the ſame kind.</note> upon your noble and learned friend's<note n="8" place="bottom">Doubtleſs, Lord Hardwick.</note> character, ſuch as I ſhould quite reject, and endeavour to do ſomething better towards doing juſtice to the character. But as I cannot expect to attain my deſires in that reſpect, it would be a great ſatisfaction to me, as well as an honour to our work, to have the favour of the genuine ſpeech. It is a method that ſeveral have been pleaſed to take, as I could ſhew, but I think myſelf under a reſtraint. I ſhall ſay ſo far, that I have had ſome by a third hand, which I underſtood well enough to come from the firſt; others by penny-poſt, and others by the ſpeakers themſelves, who have been pleaſed to viſit St. John's Gate, and ſhew particular marks of their being pleaſed <note n="9" place="bottom">Birch's MSS. in the Britiſh Muſeum, 4302.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is no reaſon, I believe, to doubt the veracity of Cave. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remarkable, that none of theſe letters are in the years during which Johnſon alone furniſhed the Debates, and one of them is in the very year after he ceaſed from that labour. Johnſon told me, that as ſoon as he found that the ſpeeches were thought genuine, he determined that he would write no more of them, for <q rend="inline">"he would not be acceſſary to the propagation of falſhood."</q> And ſuch was the tenderneſs of his conſcience, that a ſhort time before his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0548300101:109"/>
 death he expreſſed a regret for his having been the authour of fictions, which had paſſed for realities.</p>
               <p>He nevertheleſs agreed with me in thinking, that the Debates which he had framed were to be valued as Orations upon queſtions of publick importance. They have accordingly been collected in volumes, properly arranged, and recommended to the notice of parliamentary ſpeakers by a Preface, written by no inferiour hand <note n="1" place="bottom">I am well aſſured, that the editor is Mr. George Chalmers, whoſe commercial works are well known and eſteemed.</note>. I muſt, however, obſerve, that although there is in thoſe Debates a wonderful ſtore of political information, and very powerful eloquence, I cannot agree that they exhibit the manner of each particular ſpeaker, as Sir John Hawkins ſeems to think. But, indeed, what opinion can we have of his judgement, and taſte in publick ſpeaking, who preſumes to give, as the characteriſticks of two celebrated orators, <q rend="inline">"the deep-mouthed rancour of Pulteney, and the yelping pertinacity of Pitt <note n="2" place="bottom">Hawkins's Life of Johnſon, p. 100.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This year I find that his tragedy of IRENE had been for ſome time ready for the ſtage, and that his neceſſities made him deſirous of getting as much as he could for it, without delay; for there is the following letter from Mr. Cave to Dr. Birch, in the ſame volume of manuſcripts in the Britiſh Muſeum from whence I copied thoſe above quoted. They were moſt obligingly pointed out to me by Sir William Muſgrave, one of the Curators of that noble repoſitory.</p>

                     <p>You mentioned the propoſal of printing in numbers, as an alteration in the ſcheme, but I believe you miſtook, ſome way or other, my meaning; I had no other view than that you might rather print too many of five ſheets, than of five and thirty.</p>

                     <p>I think the inſertion of the exact dates of the moſt important events in the margin, or of ſo many events as may enable the reader to regulate the order of facts with ſufficient exactneſs, the proper medium between a journal which has regard only to time, and a hiſtory which ranges facts according to their dependence on each other, and poſtpones or anticipates according to the convenience of narration. I think the work ought to partake of the ſpirit of hiſtory, which is contrary to minute exactneſs, and of the regularity of a journal, which is inconſiſtent with ſpirit. For this reaſon, I neither admit numbers or dates, nor reject them.</p>
                     <p>I am of your opinion with regard to placing moſt of the reſolutions, &amp;c. in the margin, and think we ſhall give the moſt complete account of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary proceedings that can be contrived.

                  </note>: yet, as he undoubtedly had a warm and vigorous, though unregulated mind, had ſeen life in all its varieties, and been much in the company of the ſtateſmen and wits of his time, he could communicate to Johnſon an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſupply of ſuch materials as his philoſophical curioſity moſt eagerly deſired; and as Savage's misfortunes and miſconduct had reduced him to the loweſt ſtate of wretchedneſs as a writer for bread, his viſits to St. John's Gate naturally brought Johnſon and him together <note n="1" place="bottom">
                     <p>Sir John Hawkins gives the world to underſtand, that Johnſon <q rend="inline">"being an admirer of genteel manners, was captivated by the addreſs and demeanour of Savage, who, as to his exterior, was, to a remarkable degree, accompliſhed."</q>—Hawkins's Life, p. 52. But Sir John's notions of gentility muſt appear ſomewhat ludicrous, from his ſtating the following circumſtance as preſumptive evidence that Savage was a good ſwordſman: <q rend="inline">"That he underſtood the exerciſe of a gentleman's weapon, may be inferred from the uſe made of it in that raſh encounter which is related in his life."</q> The dexterity here alluded to was, that Savage, in a nocturnal ſit of drunkenneſs, ſtabbed a man at a coffee-houſe, and killed him; for which he was tried at the Old-Bailey, and found guilty of murder.</p>
                     <p>Johnſon, indeed, deſcribes him as having <q rend="inline">"a grave and manly deportment, a ſolemn dignity of mien; but which, upon a nearer acquaintance, ſoftened into an engaging eaſineſs of manners."</q> How highly Johnſon admired him for that knowledge which he himſelf ſo much cultivated, and what kindneſs he entertained for him, appears from the following lines in the Gentleman's Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine for April, 1738, which I am aſſured were written by Johnſon:</p>

 It is melancholy to reflect, that Johnſon and Savage were ſometimes in ſuch extreme indigence, that they could not pay for a lodging; ſo that they have wandered together whole nights in the ſtreets. Yet in theſe almoſt incredible ſcenes of diſtreſs, we may ſuppoſe that Savage mentioned many of the anecdotes with which Johnſon afterwards enriched the life of his unhappy companion, and thoſe of other Poets.</p>
               <p>He mentioned to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, that one night in particular, when Savage and he walked round St. James's-ſquare for want of a lodging, they were not at all depreſſed by their ſituation, but in high ſpirits and brimful of patriotiſm, traverſed the ſquare for ſeveral hours, inveighed againſt the miniſter, and <q rend="inline">"reſolved they would <hi>ſtand by their country."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I am afraid, however, that by aſſociating with Savage, who was habituated to the diſſipation and licentiouſneſs of the Town, Johnſon, though his good principles remained ſteady, did not entirely preſerve that conduct, for which, in days of greater ſimplicity, he was remarked by his friend Mr. Hector; but was imperceptibly led into ſome indulgences which occaſioned much diſtreſs to his virtuous mind.</p>
               <p>That Johnſon was anxious that an authentick and favourable account of his extraordinary friend ſhould firſt get poſſeſſion of the publick attention, is evident from a letter which he wrote in the Gentleman's Magazine for Auguſt of the year preceding its publication.</p>

intreat you to inform the publick, that his life will ſpeedily be publiſhed by  a perſon who was favoured with his confidence, and received from himſelf an account of moſt of the tranſactions which he propoſes to mention, to the time of his retirement to Swanſea in Wales.</p>

You may therefore, perhaps, gratify the lovers of truth and wit, by giving me leave to inform them in your magazine, that my account will be publiſhed in 8vo. by Mr. Roberts, in Warwick-lane.</p>

               <p>In February, 1744, it accordingly came forth from the ſhop of Roberts, between whom and Johnſon I have not traced any connection, except the caſual one of this publication. In this work, although it muſt be allowed that its moral is the reverſe of—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Reſpicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo,"</hi>
                  </q> a very uſeful leſſon is inculcated, to guard men of warm paſſions from a too free indulgence of them; and the various incidents are related in ſo clear and animated a manner, and illuminated throughout with ſo much philoſophy, that it is one of the moſt intereſting narratives in the Engliſh language. Sir Joſhua Reynolds told me, that upon his return from Italy he met with it in Devonſhire, knowing nothing of its authour, and began to read it while he was ſtanding with his arm leaning againſt a chimney-piece. It ſeized his attention ſo ſtrongly, that, not being able to lay down the book till he had finiſhed it, when he attempted to move, he found his arm totally benumbed. The rapidity with which this work was compoſed, is a wonderful circumſtance. Johnſon has been heard to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of Savage at a ſitting; but then I ſat up all night <note n="2" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 35.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He exhibits the genius of Savage to the beſt advantage, in the ſpecimens of his poetry which he has ſelected, ſome of which are of uncommon merit.

 We, indeed, occaſionally find ſuch vigour and ſuch point, as might make us ſuppoſe that the generous aid of Johnſon had been imparted to his friend. Mr. Thomas Warton made this remark to me; and, in ſupport of it, quoted from the poem entitled <q rend="inline">"The Baſtard,"</q> a line in which the fancied ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of one <q rend="inline">"ſtamped in Nature's mint with extaſy,"</q> is contraſted with a regular lawful deſcendant of ſome great and ancient family:
<q>
                     <l>"No tenth tranſmitter of a fooliſh face."</l>
                  </q>
but the fact is, that this poem was publiſhed ſome years before Johnſon and Savage were acquainted.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that in this biographical diſquiſition there appears a very ſtrong ſymptom of Johnſon's prejudice againſt players; a prejudice, which may be attributed to the following cauſes: firſt, the imperfection of his organs, which were ſo defective that he was not ſuſceptible of the fine impreſſions which theatrical excellence produces upon the generality of mankind; ſecondly, the cold rejection of his tragedy; and, laſtly, the brilliant ſucceſs of Garrick, who had been his pupil, who had come to London at the ſame time with him, not in a much more proſperous ſtate than himſelf, and whoſe talents he undoubtedly rated low, compared with his own. His being outſtripped by his pupil in the race of immediate fame, as well as of fortune, probably made him feel ſome indignation, as thinking that whatever might be Garrick's merits in his art, the reward was too great when compared with what the moſt ſucceſsful efforts of literary labour could attain. At all periods of his life Johnſon uſed to talk contemptuouſly of players; but in this work he ſpeaks of them with peculiar acrimony; for which, perhaps, there was formerly too much reaſon from the licentious and diſſolute manners of thoſe engaged in that profeſſion. It is but juſtice to add, that in our own time ſuch a change has taken place, that there is no longer room for ſuch an unfavourable diſtinction.</p>
               <p>His ſchoolfellow and friend, Dr. Taylor, told me a pleaſant anecdote of Johnſon's triumphing over his pupil David Garrick. When that great actor had played ſome little time at Goodman's-fields, Johnſon and Taylor went to ſee him perſorm, and afterwards paſſed the evening at a tavern with him and old Giffard. Johnſon, who was ever depreciating ſtage-players, after cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring ſome miſtakes in emphaſis which Garrick had committed in the courſe of that night's acting, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"the players, Sir, have got a kind of rant, with which they run on, without any regard either to accent or emphaſis."</q> Both Garrick and Giffard were offended at this ſarcaſm, and endeavoured to refute it; upon which Johnſon rejoined, <q rend="inline">"Well now, I'll give you ſomething to ſpeak, with which you are little acquainted, and then we ſhall ſee how juſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0548300101:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my obſervation is. That ſhall be the criterion. Let me hear you repeat the  ninth Commandment, <q rend="inline">"Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour."</q>
                  </q> Both tried at it, ſaid Dr. Taylor, and both miſtook the emphaſis, which ſhould be upon <hi>not</hi> and <hi>falſe witneſs.</hi> Johnſon put them right, and enjoyed his victory with great glee.</p>
               <p>His <q rend="inline">"Life of Savage"</q> was no ſooner publiſhed, than the following liberal praiſe was given to it, in <q rend="inline">"The Champion,"</q> a periodical paper: <q rend="inline">"This pamphlet is, without flattery to its authour, as juſt and well written a piece as of its kind I ever ſaw; ſo that at the ſame time that it highly deſerves, it certainly ſtands very little in need of this recommendation. As to the hiſtory of the unfortunate perſon, whoſe memoirs compoſe this work, it is certainly penned with equal accuracy and ſpirit, of which I am ſo much the better judge, as I know many of the facts mentioned to be ſtrictly true, and very fairly related. Beſides, it is not only the ſtory of Mr. Savage, but innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable incidents relating to other perſons, and other affairs, which renders this a very amuſing, and, withal, a very inſtructive and valuable performance. The authour's obſervations are ſhort, ſignificant, and juſt, as his narrative is remarkably ſmooth and well diſpoſed. His reflections open to all the receſſes of the human heart; and, in a word, a more juſt or pleaſant, a more engaging or a more improving treatiſe, on all the excellencies and defects of human nature, is ſcarce to be found in our own, or, perhaps, any other language."</q> This paper is well known to have been written by the celebrated Henry Fielding. But, I ſuppoſe, Johnſon was not informed of his being indebted to him for this civility; for if he had been appriſed of that circumſtance, as he was very ſenſible of praiſe, he probably would not have ſpoken with ſo little reſpect of Fielding, as we ſhall find he afterwards did.</p>
               <p>Johnſon's partiality for Savage made him entertain no doubt of his ſtory, however extraordinary and improbable. It never occurred to him to queſtion his being the ſon of the Counteſs of Macclesfield, of whoſe unrelenting bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity he ſo loudly complained, and the particulars of which are related in ſo ſtrong and affecting a manner in Johnſon's life of him. Johnſon was certainly well warranted in publiſhing his narrative, however offenſive it might be to the Lady and her relations, becauſe her alledged unnatural and cruel conduct to her ſon, and ſhameful avowal of guilt, were ſtated in a life of Savage now lying before me, which came out ſo early as 1727, and no attempt had been made to confute it, or to puniſh the authour or printer as a libeller: but, for the honour of human nature, we ſhould be glad to find the ſhocking tale not true; and, from a reſpectable gentleman connected with the Lady's family, I
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0548300101:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 have received ſuch information and remarks, as joined to my own inquiries, will, I think, render it at leaſt ſomewhat doubtful, eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it muſt have originated from the perſon himſelf who went by the name of Richard Savage.</p>
               <p>If the maxim <hi>falſum in uno, falſum in omnibus,</hi> were to be received without qualification, the credit of Savage's narrative, as conveyed to us, would be annihilated; for it contains ſome aſſertions which, beyond a queſtion, are not true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In order to induce a belief that Earl Rivers, on account of a criminal connection with whom, Lady Macclesfield is ſaid to have been divorced from her huſband, by Act of Parliament <note n="3" place="bottom">1697.</note>, had a peculiar anxiety about the child which ſhe bore to him, it is alledged, that his Lordſhip gave him his own name, and had it duly recorded in the regiſter of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I have carefully inſpected that regiſter, but no ſuch entry is to be found.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſtated, that <q rend="inline">"Lady Macclesfield having lived for ſome time upon very uneaſy terms with her huſband, thought a publick confeſſion of adultery the moſt obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her liberty;"</q> and Johnſon, aſſuming this to be true, ſtigmatiſes her with indignation, as <q rend="inline">"the wretch who had, without ſcruple, proclaimed herſelf an adultereſs."</q> But I have peruſed the Journals of both houſes of Parliament at the period of her divorce, and there find it authentically aſcertained, that ſo far from voluntarily ſubmitting to the ignominious charge of adultery, ſhe made a ſtrenuous defence by her Counſel; the bill having been firſt moved 15th January, 1697, in the Houſe of Lords, and proceeded on, (with various applications for time to bring up witneſſes at a diſtance, &amp;c.) at intervals, till the 3d of March, when it paſſed. It was brought to the Commons, by a meſſage from the Lords, the 5th of March, proceeded on the 7th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th, on which day, after a full examination of witneſſes on both ſides, and hearing of Counſel, it was reported without amendments, paſſed, and carried to the Lords.</p>
               <p>That Lady Macclesfield was convicted of the crime of which ſhe was accuſed, cannot be denied; but the queſtion now is, whether the perſon calling himſelf Richard Savage was her ſon.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that when Earl Rivers was dying, and anxious to provide for all his natural children, he was informed by Lady Macclesfield that her ſon by him was dead. Whether, then, ſhall we believe that this was a malignant lie, invented by a mother to prevent her own child from receiving
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0548300101:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the bounty of his father, which was accordingly the conſequence, if the perſon  whoſe life Johnſon wrote, was her ſon; or ſhall we not rather believe that the perſon who then aſſumed the name of Richard Savage was an impoſtor, being in reality the ſon of the ſhoemaker, under whoſe wife's care Lady Macclesfield's child was placed; that after the death of the real Richard Savage, he attempted to perſonate him, and that the fraud being known to Lady Macclesfield, he was therefore repulſed by her with juſt reſentment.</p>
               <p>There is a ſtrong circumſtance in ſupport of the laſt ſuppoſition, though it has been mentioned as an aggravation of Lady Macclesfield's unnatural conduct, and that is, her having prevented him from obtaining the benefit of a legacy left to him by Mrs. Lloyd his god-mother. For if there was ſuch a legacy left, his not being able to obtain payment of it, muſt be imputed to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs that he was not the real perſon. The juſt inference ſhould be, that by the death of Lady Macclesfield's child before its god-mother, the legacy became lapſed, and therefore that Johnſon's Richard Savage was an impoſtor. If he had a title to the legacy, he could not have found any difficulty in recovering it; for had the executors reſiſted his claim, the whole coſts, as well as the legacy, muſt have been paid by them, if he had been the child to whom it was given.</p>
               <p>The talents of Savage, and the mingled fire, rudeneſs, pride, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ferocity of his character <note n="4" place="bottom">Johnſon's companion appears to have perſuaded that lofty-minded man, that he reſembled him in having a noble pride; for Johnſon, after painting in ſtrong colours the quarrel between Lord Tyrconnel and Savage, aſſerts that <q rend="inline">"the ſpirit of Mr. Savage, indeed, never ſuffered him to ſolicit a reconciliation; he returned reproach for reproach, and inſult for inſult."</q> But the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gentleman to whom I have alluded, has in his poſſeſſion a letter from Savage, after Lord Tyrconnel had diſcarded him, addreſſed to the Reverend Mr. Gilbert, his Lordſhip's Chaplain, in which he requeſts him, in the humbleſt manner, to repreſent his caſe to the Earl.</note>, concur in making it credible that he was fit to plan and carry on an ambitious and daring ſcheme of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſimilar inſtances of which have not been wanting in higher ſpheres, in the hiſtory of different countries, and have had a conſiderable degree of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Yet, on the other hand, to the companion of Johnſon, (who through whatever medium he was conveyed into this world,—be it ever ſo doubtful <q rend="inline">"To whom related, or by whom begot,"</q> was, unqueſtionably, a man of no common endowments,) we muſt allow the weight of general repute as to his <hi>Status</hi> or parentage, though illicit; and ſuppoſing him to be an impoſtor, it ſeems ſtrange that Lord Tyrconnel, the nephew of Lady Macclesfield, ſhould
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0548300101:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 patroniſe him, and even admit him as a gueſt in his family <note n="5" place="bottom">Truſting to Savage's information, Johnſon repreſents this unhappy man's being received as a companion by Lord Tyrconnel, and penſioned by his Lordſhip, as if poſteriour to Savage's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and pardon. But I am aſſured, that Savage had received the voluntary bounty of Lord Tyrconnel, and had been diſmiſſed by him long before the murder was committed, and that his Lordſhip was very inſtrumental in procuring Savage's pardon, by his interceſſion with the Queen, through Lady Hertford. If, therefore, he had been deſirous of preventing any publication by Savage, he would have left him to his fate. Indeed I muſt obſerve, that although Johnſon men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that Lord Tyrconnel's patronage of Savage was <q rend="inline">"upon his promiſe to lay aſide his deſign of expoſing the cruelty of his mother,"</q> the great biographer has forgotten that he himſelf has mentioned, that Savage's ſtory had been told ſeveral years before in <q rend="inline">"The Plain Dealer,"</q> from which he quotes this ſtrong ſaying of the generous Sir Richard Steele, that <q rend="inline">"the inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every good man his father."</q> At the ſame time it muſt be acknowledged, that Lady Macclesfield and her relations might ſtill wiſh that her ſtory ſhould not be brought into more conſpicuous notice by the ſatirical pen of Savage.</note>. Laſtly, it muſt ever appear very ſuſpicious, that three different accounts of the Life of Richard Savage, one publiſhed in <q rend="inline">"The Plain Dealer,"</q> in 1724, another in 1727, and another by the powerful pen of Johnſon, in 1749, and all of them while Lady Macclesfield was alive, ſhould, notwithſtanding the ſevere attacks upon her, have been ſuffered to paſs without any publick and effectual contradiction.</p>
               <p>I have thus endeavoured to ſum up the evidence upon the caſe, as fairly as I can; and the reſult ſeems to be, that the world muſt vibrate in a ſtate of uncertainty as to what was the truth.</p>
               <p>This digreſſion, I truſt, will not be cenſured, as it relates to a matter exceedingly curious, and very intimately connected with Johnſon, both as a man and an authour <note n="6" place="bottom">Miſs Maſon, after having forfeited the title of Lady Macclesfield by divorce, was married to Colonel Brett, and, it is ſaid, was well known in all the polite circles. Colley Cibber, I am informed, had ſo high an opinion of her taſte and judgement as to genteel life and manners, that he ſubmitted every ſcene of his <q rend="inline">"Careleſs Huſband,"</q> to Mrs. Brett's reviſal and correction. Colonel Brett was reported to be too free in his gallantry with his Lady's maid. Mrs. Brett came into a room one day in her own houſe, and found the Colonel and her maid both faſt aſleep in two chairs. She tied a white handkerchief round her huſband's neck, which was a ſufficient proof that ſhe had diſcovered his intrigue; but ſhe never at any time took notice of it to him. This incident, as I am told, gave occaſion to the well-wrought ſcene of Sir Charles and Lady Eaſy and Edging.</note>.</p>
               <p>He this year wrote the <q rend="inline">"Preface to the Harleian Miſcellany. *"</q> The ſelection of the pamphlets of which it was compoſed was made by Mr. Oldys, a man of eager curioſity and indefatigable diligence, who firſt exerted that ſpirit of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0548300101:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inquiry into the literature of the old Engliſh writers, by which the works of our great dramatick poet have of late been ſo ſignally illuſtrated.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1745" type="year">
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1745. Aetat. 36."/> In 1745 he publiſhed a pamphlet entitled <q rend="inline">"Miſcellaneous Obſervations on the Tragedy of Macbeth, with Remarks on Sir T. H's (Sir Thomas Hanmer's) Edition of Shakſpeare. *"</q> To which he affixed, propoſals for a new edition of that poet.</p>
               <p>As we do not trace any thing elſe publiſhed by him during the courſe of this year, we may conjecture that he was occupied entirely with that work. But the little encouragement which was given by the publick to his anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous propoſals for the execution of a taſk which Warburton was known to have undertaken, probably damped his ardour. His pamphlet, however, was highly eſteemed, and was fortunate enough to obtain the approbation even of the ſupercilious Warburton himſelf, who, in the Preface to his Shakſpeare publiſhed two years afterwards, thus mentioned it: <q rend="inline">"As to all thoſe things which have been publiſhed under the titles of <hi>Eſſays, Remarks, Obſervations,</hi> &amp;c. on Shakſpeare, if you except ſome critical notes on Macbeth, given as a ſpecimen of a projected edition, and written, as appears, by a man of parts and genius, the reſt are abſolutely below a ſerious notice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of this flattering diſtinction ſhewn to him by Warburton, a very grateful remembrance was ever entertained by Johnſon, who ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He praiſed me at a time when praiſe was of value to me."</q>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="1746" type="year">
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1746"/> In 1746 it is probable that he was ſtill employed upon his Shakſpeare, which perhaps he laid aſide for a time, upon account of the high expectations which were formed of Warburton's edition of that great poet. It is ſomewhat curious, that his literary career appears to have been almoſt totally ſuſpended in the years 1745 and 1746, thoſe years which were marked by a civil war in Great-Britain, when a raſh attempt was made to reſtore the Houſe of Stuart to the throne. That he had a tenderneſs for that unfortunate Houſe, is well known; and ſome may fancifully imagine, that a ſympathethick anxiety impeded the exertion of his intellectual powers: but I am inclined to think, that he was, during this time, ſketching the outlines of his great philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical work.</p>
               <p>None of his letters during thoſe years are extant, ſo far as I can diſcover. This is much to be regretted. It might afford ſome entertainment to ſee how he then expreſſed himſelf to his private friends, concerning ſtate affairs. Dr. Adams informs me, that <q rend="inline">"at this time a favourite object which he had in contemplation was 'The Life of Alfred,' in which, from the warmth with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0548300101:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he ſpoke about it, he would, I believe, had he been maſter of his own will, have engaged himſelf, rather than on any other ſubject."</q>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1747. Aetat. 38."/> In 1747 it is ſuppoſed that the Gentleman's Magazine for May was enriched by him with five ſhort poetical pieces, diſtinguiſhed by three aſteriſks. The firſt is a tranſlation, or rather a paraphraſe, of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer. Whether the Latin was his, or not, I have never heard, though I ſhould think it probably was, if it be certain that he wrote the Engliſh; as to which my only cauſe of doubt is, that his ſlighting character of Hanmer as an editor, in his <q rend="inline">"Obſervations on Macbeth,"</q> is very different from that in the Epitaph. It may be ſaid, that there is the ſame contrariety between the character in the Obſervations, and that in his own Preface to Shakſpeare; but a conſiderable time elapſed between the one publication and the other, whereas the Obſervations and the Epitaph came cloſe together. The others are, <q rend="inline">"To Miſs—, on her giving the Authour a gold and ſilk net-work Purſe of her own weaving;"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Stella in Mourning;"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"The Winter's Walk;"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"An Ode;"</q> and, <q rend="inline">"To Lyce, an elderly Lady."</q> I am not poſitive that all theſe were his productions; but as <q rend="inline">"The Winter's Walk,"</q> has never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted to be his, and all of them have the ſame mark, it is reaſonable to conclude that they are all written by the ſame hand. Yet to the Ode, in which we find a paſſage very characteriſtick of him, being a learned deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gout,
<q>
                     <l>"Unhappy, whom to beds of pain</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>"Arthritick</hi> tyranny conſigns;"</l>
                  </q>
there is the following note: <q rend="inline">"The authour being ill of the gout:"</q> but Johnſon was not attacked with that diſtemper till at a very late period of his life. May not this, however, be a poetical fiction? Why may not a poet ſuppoſe himſelf to have the gout, as well as ſuppoſe himſelf to be in love, of which we have innumerable inſtances, and which has been admirably ridiculed by Johnſon in his <q rend="inline">"Life of Cowley?"</q> I have alſo ſome difficulty to believe that he could produce ſuch a group of <hi>conceits</hi> as appear in the verſes to Lyce, in which he claims for this ancient perſonage as good a right to be aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>heaven,</hi> as nymphs whom other poets have flattered; he therefore ironically aſcribes to her the attributes of the <hi>ſky,</hi> in ſuch ſtanzas as this:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Her teeth the <hi>night</hi> with <hi>darkneſs</hi> dies,</l>

                     <l>"Her tongue like nimble <hi>lightning</hi> plies,</l>
                     <l>"And can with <hi>thunder</hi> roar."</l>

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0548300101:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But as at a very advanced age he could condeſcend to trifle in <hi>namby pamby</hi>  rhymes to pleaſe Mrs. Thrale and her daughter, he may have, in his earlier years, compoſed ſuch a pieoe as this.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that in this firſt edition of <q rend="inline">"The Winter's Walk,"</q> the concluding line is much more Johnſonian than it was afterwards printed; for in ſubſequent editions after praying Stella to <q rend="inline">"ſnatch him to her arms,"</q> he ſays,
<q>
                     <l>"And <hi>ſhield</hi> me from the <hi>ills</hi> of life."</l>
                  </q>

                  </q>
A horrour at life in general is more conſonant with Johnſon's habitual gloomy caſt of thought.</p>
               <p>I have heard him repeat with great energy the following verſes, which appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for April this year; but I have no authority to ſay they were his own.

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0548300101:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> This year his old pupil and friend, David Garrick, having become joint patentee and manager of Drury-lane theatre, Johnſon honoured his opening of it with a Prologue, * which for juſt and manly dramatick criticiſm, on the whole range of the Engliſh ſtage, as well as for poetical excellence, is unrivalled. Like the celebrated Epilogue to the <q rend="inline">"Diſtreſſed Mother,"</q> it was, during the ſeaſon, often called for by the audience. The moſt ſtriking and brilliant paſſages of it have been ſo often repeated, and are ſo well recollected by all the lovers of the drama and of poetry, that it would be ſuperfluous to point them out. In the Gentleman's Magazine for December this year, he inſerted an <q rend="inline">"Ode on Winter,"</q> which is, I think, an admirable ſpecimen of his genius for lyrick poetry.</p>
               <p>But the year 1747 is diſtinguiſhed as the epoch, when Johnſon's arduous and important work, his DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, was announced to the world, by the publication of its Plan or <hi>Proſpectus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How long this immenſe undertaking had been the object of his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, I do not know. I once aſked him by what means he had attained to that aſtoniſhing knowledge of our language, by which he was enabled to realiſe a deſign of ſuch extent, and accumulated difficulty. He told me, that <q rend="inline">"it was not the effect of particular ſtudy; but that it had grown up in his mind inſenſibly."</q> I have been informed by Mr. James Dodſley, that ſeveral years before this period, when Johnſon was one day ſitting in his brother Robert's ſhop, he heard his brother ſuggeſt to him, that a Dictionary of the Engliſh Language would be a work that would be well received by the publick; that Johnſon ſeemed at firſt to catch at the propoſition, but, after a pauſe, ſaid, in his abrupt deciſive manner, <q rend="inline">"I believe I ſhall not undertake it."</q> That he, however, had beſtowed much thought upon the ſubject, before he publiſhed his <q rend="inline">"Plan,"</q> is evident from the enlarged, clear, and accurate views which it exhibits; and we find him mentioning in that tract, that many of the writers whoſe teſtimonies were to be produced as authorities, were ſelected by Pope, which proves that he had been furniſhed, probably by Mr. Robert Dodſley, with whatever hints that eminent poet had contributed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0548300101:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
towards a great literary project, that had been the ſubject of important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration  in a former reign.</p>
               <p>The bookſellers who contracted with Johnſon, ſingle and unaided, for the execution of a work, which in other countries has not been effected but by the co-operating exertions of many, were Mr. Robert Dodſley, Mr. Charles Hitch, Mr. Andrew Millar, the two Meſſieurs Longman, and the two Meſſieurs Knapton. The price ſtipulated was fifteen hundred and ſeventy-five pounds.</p>
               <p>The <q rend="inline">"Plan"</q> was addreſſed to Philip Dormer, Earl of Cheſterfield, then one of his Majeſty's Principal Secretaries of State, a nobleman who was very ambitious of literary diſtinction, and who, upon being informed of the deſign, had expreſſed himſelf in terms very favourable to its ſucceſs. There is, perhaps, in every thing of any conſequence, a ſecret hiſtory which it would be amuſing to know, could we have it authentically communicated. Johnſon told me <note n="3" place="bottom">September 22, 1777, going from Aſhbourne in Derbyſhire, to ſee Iſlam.</note>, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the way in which the Plan of my Dictionary came to be inſcribed to Lord Cheſterfield, was this: I had neglected to write it by the time appointed. Dodſley ſuggeſted a deſire to have it addreſſed to Lord Cheſterfield. I laid hold of this as a pretext for delay, that it might be better done, and let Dodſley have his deſire. I ſaid to my friend Dr. Bathurſt, 'Now if any good comes of my addreſſing to Lord Cheſterfield, it will be aſcribed to deep policy, when, in fact, it was only a caſual excuſe for lazineſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is worthy of obſervation, that the <q rend="inline">"Plan"</q> has not only the ſubſtantial merit of comprehenſion, perſpicuity, and preciſion, but that the language of it is unexceptionably excellent, it being altogether free from that inflation of ſtyle, and thoſe uncommon but apt and energetick words, which in ſome of his writings have been cenſured with more petulance than juſtice; and never was there a more dignified ſtrain of compliment, than that in which he courts the attention of one whom he had been perſuaded to believe would be a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able patron.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"With regard to queſtions of purity or propriety, (ſays he) I was once in doubt whether I ſhould not attribute to myſelf too much in attempting to decide them, and whether my province was to extend beyond the propoſition of the queſtion, and the diſplay of the ſuffrages on each ſide; but I have been ſince determined by your Lordſhip's opinion, to interpoſe my own judgement, and ſhall therefore endeavour to ſupport what appears to me moſt conſonant to

               </p>
               <p>This paſſage proves, that Johnſon's addreſſing his <q rend="inline">"Plan"</q> to Lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field was not merely in conſequence of the reſult of a report by means of Dodſley, that the Earl favoured the deſign; but that there had been a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular communication with his Lordſhip concerning it. Dr. Taylor told me, that Johnſon ſent his <q rend="inline">"Plan"</q> to him in manuſcript, for his peruſal; and that when it was lying upon his table, Mr. William Whitehead happened to pay him a viſit, and being ſhewn it, was highly pleaſed with ſuch parts of it as he had time to read, and begged to take it home with him, which he was allowed to do; that from him it got into the hands of a noble Lord, who carried it to Lord Cheſterfield. When Taylor obſerved this might be an advantage, Johnſon replied, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; it would have come out with more bloom, if it had not been ſeen before by any body."</q>
               </p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1748. Aetat. 39."/> Dr. Adams found him one day buſy at his Dictionary, when the following dialogue enſued. <q rend="inline">"ADAMS. This is a great work, Sir. How are you to get all the etymologies? JOHNSON. Why, Sir, here is a ſhelf with Junius, and Skinner, and others; and there is a Welch gentleman who has publiſhed a collection of Welch proverbs, who will help me with the Welch. ADAMS. But, Sir, how can you do this in three years? JOHNSON. Sir, I have no doubt that I can do it in three years. ADAMS. But the French Academy, which conſiſts of forty members, took forty years to compile their Dictionary. JOHNSON. Sir, thus it is. This is the proportion. Let me ſee; forty times forty is ſixteen hundred. As three to ſixteen hundred, ſo is the proportion of an Engliſhman to a Frenchman."</q> With ſo much eaſe and pleaſantry could he talk of that prodigious labour which he had undertaken to execute.</p>
               <p>The publick has had, from another pen, a long detail of what had been done in this country by prior Lexicographers, and no doubt Johnſon was wiſe to avail himſelf of them, ſo far as they went; but the learned, yet judicious reſearch of etymology, the various, yet accurate diſplay of definition, and the rich collection of authorities, were reſerved for the ſuperiour mind of our great philologiſt. For the mechanical part, he employed, as he told me, ſix amanuenſes; and let it be remembered by the natives of North-Britain, to whom he is ſuppoſed to have been ſo hoſtile, that five of them were of that country. There were two Meſſieurs Macbean; Mr. Shiels, the writer of the Lives of the Poets to which the name of Cibber is affixed; Mr. Stewart, ſon of Mr. George Stewart, bookſeller at Edinburgh; and, a Mr. Maitland. The ſixth of theſe humble aſſiſtants was Mr. Peyton, who, I believe, taught French, and publiſhed ſome elementary tracts.</p>
               <p>To all theſe painful labourers, Johnſon ſhewed a never-ceaſing kindneſs, ſo far as they ſtood in need of it. The elder Mr. Macbean had afterwards the honour of being Librarian to Archibald, Duke of Argyle, for many years, but was left without a ſhilling. Johnſon wrote for him a Preface to <q rend="inline">"A Syſtem of ancient Geography;"</q> and, by the favour of Lord Thurlow, got him admitted a poor brother of the Charterhouſe. For Shiels, who died of a conſumption, he had much tenderneſs; and it has been thought that ſome choice ſentences in the Lives of the Poets were ſupplied by him. Peyton, when reduced to penury, had frequent aid from the bounty of Johnſon, who at laſt was at the expence of burying both him and his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0548300101:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 While the Dictionary was going forward, Johnſon lived part of the time in Holborn, part in Gough-ſquare, Fleet-ſtreet; and he had an upper room fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up like a counting-houſe for the purpoſe, in which he gave to the copyiſts their ſeveral taſks. The words, partly taken from other dictionaries, and partly ſupplied by himſelf, having been firſt written down with ſpaces left between them, he delivered in writing their etymologies, definitions, and various ſignifications. The authorities were copied from the books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in which he had marked the paſſages with a black-lead pencil, the traces of which could eaſily be effaced. I have ſeen ſeveral of them, in which that trouble had not been taken; ſo that they were juſt as when uſed by the copyiſts. It is remarkable, that he was ſo attentive in the choice of the paſſages in which words were authoriſed, that one may read page after page of his Dictionary with improvement and pleaſure; and it ſhould not paſs unobſerved, that he has quoted no authour whoſe writings had a tendency to hurt ſound religion and morality.</p>
               <p>The neceſſary expence of preparing a work of ſuch magnitude for the preſs, muſt have been a conſiderable deduction from the price ſtipulated to be paid for the copy-right. I underſtand that nothing was allowed by the bookſellers on that account; and I remember his telling me, that a large portion of it having, by miſtake, been written upon both ſides of the paper, ſo as to be inconvenient for the compoſitor, it coſt him twenty pounds to have it tranſcribed upon one ſide only.</p>
               <p>He is now to be conſidered as <q rend="inline">"tugging at his oar,"</q> as engaged in a ſteady continued courſe of occupation, ſufficient to employ all his time for ſome years, and which was the beſt preventive of that conſtitutional melancholy which was ever lurking about him, ready to trouble his quiet. But his enlarged and lively mind could not be ſatisfied without more diverſity of employment, and the pleaſure of animated relaxation. He therefore not only exerted his talents in occaſional compoſition very different from Lexicography, but formed a club in Ivy-lane, Paternoſter-row, with a view to enjoy literary diſcuſſion, and amuſe his evening hours. The members aſſociated with him in this little ſociety were his beloved friend Dr. Richard Bathurſt, Mr. Hawkeſworth, afterwards well known by his writings, Mr. John Hawkins, an attorney <note n="5" place="bottom">He was afterwards for ſeveral years Chairman of the Middleſex Juſtices, and upon occaſion of preſenting ſome addreſs to the King, accepted the uſual offer of Knighthood. He is authour of <q rend="inline">"A Hiſtory of Muſick,"</q> in five volumes in quarto. By aſſiduous attendance upon Johnſon in his laſt illneſs, he obtained the office of one of his executors; in conſequence of which, the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers of London employed him to publiſh an edition of Dr. Johnſon's works, and to write his Life.</note>, and a few others of different profeſſions.</p>

In the Gentleman's Magazine for May of this year he wrote a <q rend="inline">"Life of  Lord Roſcommon, *"</q> with Notes, which he afterwards much improved, indented the notes into text, and inſerted it amongſt his Lives of the Engliſh Poets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dodſley this year brought out his PRECEPTOR, one of the moſt valuable books for the improvement of young minds that has appeared in any language; and to this meritorious work Johnſon furniſhed <q rend="inline">"The Preface, *"</q> containing a general ſketch of the book, with a ſhort and perſpicuous recommendation of each article; as alſo, <q rend="inline">"The Viſion of Theodore the Hermit, found in his Cell, *"</q> a moſt beautiful allegory of human life, under the figure of aſcending the mountain of Exiſtence. The Biſhop of Dromore heard Dr. Johnſon ſay, that he thought this was the beſt thing he ever wrote.</p>

But the fact is, that the poem was publiſhed on the 9th of January, and the tragedy was not acted till the 6th of the February following.</note>. Mrs. Johnſon, for the ſake of country air, had lodgings at Hampſtead, to which he reſorted occaſionally, and there the greateſt part, if not the whole, of this Imitation was written. The fervid rapidity with which it was produced, is ſcarcely credible. I have heard him ſay, that he compoſed ſeventy lines of it in one day, without putting one of them upon paper till they were finiſhed. I remember when I once regretted to him that he had not given us more of Juvenal's Satires, he ſaid he probably ſhould give more, for he had them all in his head; by which I underſtood, that he had the originals and correſpondent alluſions floating in his mind, which he could, when he pleaſed, embody and render permanent without much labour. Some of them, however, he obſerved, were too groſs for imitation.</p>
               <p>The profits of a ſingle poem, however excellent, appear to have been very ſmall in the laſt reign, compared with what a publication of the ſame ſize has ſince been known to yield.

                           <hi>"De naturâ coeli,</hi> &amp;c."</q> in which he attacked the ſentiments of Scaliger and Ariſtotle, not bearing to hear it urged, <hi>that ſome things are true in philoſophy and falſe in divinity.</hi> He made above 600 Sermons on the harmony of the Evangeliſts. Being unſucceſsful in publiſhing his works, he lay in the priſon of Bocardo at Oxford, and in the King's Bench, till Biſhop Uſher, Dr. Laud, Sir William Boſwel, and Dr. Pink, releaſed him by paying his debts. He petitioned King Charles I. to be ſent into Ethiopia, &amp;c. to procure MSS. Having ſpoken in favour of monarchy and biſhops, he was plundered by the parliament forces, and twice carried away priſoner from his rectory; and afterwards had not a ſhirt to ſhift him in three months, without he borrowed it, and died very poor in 1646."</q>
                  </note>. That of the warrior, Charles of Sweden, is, I think, as highly finiſhed a picture as can poſſibly be conceived.</p>

               <p>Garrick being now veſted with theatrical power by being manager of Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane theatre, he kindly and generouſly made uſe of it to bring out Johnſon's tragedy, which had been long kept back for want of encouragement. But in this benevolent purpoſe he met with no ſmall difficulty from the temper of Johnſon, which could not brook that a drama which he had formed with much ſtudy, and had been obliged to keep more than the nine years of Horace,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0548300101:137"/>
 ſhould be reviſed and altered at the pleaſure of an actor. Yet Garrick knew well, that without ſome alterations it would not he fit for the ſtage. A violent diſpute having enſued between them, Garrick applied to the Reverend Dr. Taylor to interpoſe. Johnſon was at firſt very obſtinate. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) the fellow wants me to make Mahomet run mad, that be may have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of toſſing his hands and kicking his heels <note n="1" place="bottom">Mahomet was, in fact, played by Mr. Barry, and Demetrius by Mr. Garrick; but probably at this time the parts were not yet caſt.</note>."</q> He was, however, at laſt, with difficulty, prevailed on to comply with Garrick's wiſhes, ſo as to allow of ſome changes; but ſtill there were not enough.</p>
               <p>Dr. Adams was preſent the firſt night of the repreſentation of IRENE, and gave me the following account: <q rend="inline">"Before the curtain drew up, there were catcalls whiſtling, which alarmed Johnſon's friends.

                        <p>The expreſſion uſed by Dr. Adams was <q rend="inline">"ſoothed."</q> I ſhould rather think the audience was <hi>awed</hi> by the extraordinary ſpirit and dignity of the following lines:</p>

                              <l>"Should partial catcalls all his hopes confound,</l>
                              <l>"He bids no trumpet quell the fatal ſound;</l>

                        <hi>"Murder, murder."</hi>
                     </q> She ſeveral times attempted to ſpeak, but in vain. At laſt ſhe was obliged to go off the ſtage alive."</q> This paſſage was afterwards ſtruck out, and ſhe was carried off to be put to death behind the ſcenes, as the play now has it. The Epilogue was written by Sir William Young. I know not how Johnſon's play came to be thus graced by the pen of a perſon then ſo eminent in the political world.</p>

Notwithſtanding all the ſupport of ſuch performers as Garrick, Barry, Mrs.  Cibber, Mrs. Pritchard, and every advantage of dreſs and decoration, the tragedy of Irene did not pleaſe the publick. Mr. Garrick's zeal carried it through for nine nights, ſo that the authour had his three nights' profits; and from a receipt ſigned by him, now in the hands of Mr. James Dodſley, it appears that his friend Mr. Robert Dodſley gave him one hundred pounds for the copy, with his uſual reſervation of the right of one edition.</p>
               <p>IRENE, conſidered as a poem, is intitled to the praiſe of ſuperiour excellence. Analyſed into parts, it will furniſh a rich ſtore of noble ſentiments, fine imagery, and beautiful language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principal end of the drama. Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnſon not only had not the faculty of producing the impreſſions of tragedy, but that he had not the ſenſibility to perceive them. His great friend Mr. Walmſley's prediction, that he would <q rend="inline">"turn out a fine tragedy-writer,"</q> was, therefore, ill founded. Johnſon was wiſe enough to be convinced that he had not the talents neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to write ſucceſsfully for the ſtage, and never made another attempt in that ſpecies of compoſition.</p>
               <p>When aſked how he felt upon the ill ſucceſs of his tragedy, he replied, <q rend="inline">"Like the Monument;"</q> meaning that he continued firm and unmoved as that column. And let it be remembered, as an admonition to the <hi>genus irritabile</hi> of dramatick writers, that this great man, inſtead of peeviſhly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the bad taſte of the town, ſubmitted to its deciſion without a murmur. He had, indeed, upon all occaſions a great deference for the general opinion: <q rend="inline">"A man (ſaid he) who writes a book, thinks himſelf wiſer or wittier than the reſt of mankind; he ſuppoſes that he can inſtruct or amuſe them, and the publick to whom he appeals, muſt, after all, be the judges of his pretenſions."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On occaſion of his play being brought upon the ſtage, Johnſon had a fancy that as a dramatick authour his dreſs ſhould be more gay than what he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily wore; he therefore appeared behind the ſcenes, and even in one of the ſide boxes, in a ſcarlet waiſtcoat, with rich gold lace. His neceſſary attendance while his play was in rehearſal, and during its performance, brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both ſexes, which produced a more favourable opinion of their profeſſion than he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

 delight in diſſipating his gloom, by mixing in the ſprightly chit-chat of the motley circle then to be found there. Mr. David Hume related to me from Mr. Garrick, that Johnſon at laſt denied himſelf this amuſement, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of rigid virtue; ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I'll come no more behind your ſcenes, David; for the ſilk ſtockings and white boſoms of your actreſſes excite my amorous propenſities."</q>

The vehicle which he choſe was that of a periodical paper, which he knew had been, upon former occaſions, employed with great ſucceſs. The Tatler, Spectator, and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, were the laſt of the kind publiſhed in England, which had ſtood the teſt of a long trial; and ſuch an interval had now elapſed ſince their publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as made him juſtly think that, to many of his readers, this form of inſtruction would, in ſome degree, have the advantage of novelty. A few days before the firſt of his Eſſays came out, there ſtarted another competitor for ſame in the ſame form, under the title of <q rend="inline">"The Tatler Revived,"</q> which I believe was <q rend="inline">"born but to die."</q> Johnſon was, I think, not very happy in the choice of his title, <q rend="inline">"The Rambler,"</q> which certainly is not ſuited to a ſeries of grave and moral diſcourſes; which the Italians have literally, but ludicrouſly, tranſlated by <hi>Il Vagabondo;</hi> and which has been lately aſſumed as the denomination of a vehicle of licentious tales, <q rend="inline">"The Rambler's Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine."</q> He gave Sir Joſhua Reynolds the following account of its getting this name: <q rend="inline">"What <hi>muſt</hi> be done, Sir, <hi>will</hi> be done. When I was to begin publiſhing that paper, I was at a loſs how to name it. I ſat down at night upon my bedſide, and reſolved that I would not go to ſleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler ſeemed the beſt that occurred, and I took it <note n="3" place="bottom">I have heard Dr. Warton mention, that he was at Mr. Robert Dodſley's with the late Mr. Moore, and ſeveral others of his friends, conſidering what ſhould be the name of the periodical paper which Moore had undertaken. Garrick propoſed the <hi>Sallad,</hi> which, by a curious coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was afterwards applied to himſelf by Goldſmith:
<q>
                           <l>"Our Garrick's a ſallad, for in him we ſee</l>
                           <l>"Oil, vinegar, ſugar, and ſaltneſs agree!"</l>

               </p>
               <p>With what devout and conſcientious ſentiments this paper was undertaken, is evidenced by the following prayer, which he compoſed and offered up on the occaſion: <q rend="inline">"Almighty GOD, the giver of all good things, without whoſe

Amen <note n="4" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 9.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt paper of the Rambler was publiſhed on Tueſday the 20th of March, 1750; and its authour was enabled to continue it, without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every Tueſday and Friday, till Saturday the 17th of March, 1752, on which day it cloſed. This is a ſtrong confirmation of the truth of a remark of his, which I have had occaſion to quote elſewhere <note n="5" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 28.</note>, that <q rend="inline">"a man may write at any time, if he will ſet himſelf doggedly to it;"</q> for, notwithſtanding his conſtitutional indolence, his depreſſion of ſpirits, and his labour in carrying on his Dictionary, he anſwered the ſtated calls of the preſs twice a week from the ſtores of his mind, during all that time having received no aſſiſtance, except four billets in No. 10 by Miſs Mulſo, now Mrs. Chapone; No. 30, by Mrs. Catharine Talbot; No. 97, by Mr. Samuel Richardſon, whom he deſcribes in an introductory note as <q rend="inline">"An authour who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the paſſions to move at the command of virtue;"</q> and Numbers 44 and 100, by Mrs. Elizabeth Carter.</p>
               <p>Poſterity will be aſtoniſhed when they are told, upon the authority of Johnſon himſelf, that many of theſe diſcourſes, which we ſhould ſuppoſe had been laboured with all the ſlow attention of literary leiſure, were writen in haſte as the moment preſſed, without even being read over by him before they were printed. It can be accounted for only in this way; that by reading and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a very cloſe inſpection of life, he had accumulated a great fund of miſcellaneous knowledge, which, by a peculiar promptitude of mind, was ever ready at his call, and which he had conſtantly accuſtomed himſelf to clothe in the moſt apt and energetick expreſſion. Sir Joſhua Reynolds once aſked him by what means he had attained his extraordinary accuracy and flow of language. He told him, that he had early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his beſt on every occaſion, and in every company; to impart whatever he knew in the moſt forcible language he could put it in; and that by conſtant practice, and never ſuffering any careleſs expreſſions to eſcape him, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the cleareſt manner, it became habitual to him.</p>
               <p>Yet he was not altogether unprepared as a periodical writer; for I have in my poſſeſſion a ſmall duodecimo volume, in which he has written, in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0548300101:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 form of Mr. Locke's Common-Place Book, a variety of hints for eſſays on different ſubjects. He has marked upon the firſt blank leaf of it, <q rend="inline">"To the 128th page, collections for the RAMBLER;"</q> and in another place, <q rend="inline">"In fifty-two there were ſeventeen provided; in 97—21; in 190—25."</q> At a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent period (probably after the work was finiſhed) he added, <q rend="inline">"In all, taken of provided materials, 30."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir John Hawkins, who is unlucky upon all occaſions, tells us, that <q rend="inline">"this method of accumulating intelligence had been practiſed by Mr. Addiſon, and is humourouſly deſcribed in one of the Spectators, wherein he feigns to have dropped his paper of <hi>notanda,</hi> conſiſting of a diverting medley of broken ſentences and looſe hints, which he tells us he had collected, and meant to make uſe of. Much of the ſame kind is Johnſon's Adverſaria <note n="6" place="bottom">Hawkin's Life of Johnſon, p. 268.</note>."</q> But the truth is, that there is no reſemblance at all between them. Addiſon's note was a fiction, in which unconnected fragments of his lucubrations were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely jumbled together, in as odd a manner as he could, in order to produce a laughable effect.

               <p>Here we ſee the embryo of No. 45 of the Adventurer; and it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what I have mentioned, that the papers in that collection marked T. were written by Johnſon.</p>
               <p>This ſcanty preparation of materials will not, however, much diminiſh our wonder at the extraordinary fertility of his mind: for the proportion which they bear to the number of eſſays which he wrote, is very ſmall; and it is remarkable, that thoſe for which he had made no preparation, are as rich and as highly finiſhed, as thoſe for which the hints were lying by him. It is alſo to be obſerved, that the papers formed from his hints are worked up with ſuch ſtrength and elegance, that we almoſt loſe ſight of the hints, which become like <q rend="inline">"drops in the bucket."</q> Indeed, in ſeveral inſtances, he has made a very ſlender uſe of them, ſo that many of them remain ſtill unapplied <note n="8" place="bottom">Sir John Hawkins has ſelected from this little collection of materials, what he calls the <q rend="inline">"Rudiments of two of the papers of the Rambler."</q> But he has not been able to read the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript diſtinctly.

As the Rambler was entirely the work of one man, there was, of courſe,  ſuch an uniformity in its texture, as very much to exclude the charm of variety; and the grave and often ſolemn caſt of thinking, which diſtinguiſhed it from other periodical papers, made it, for ſome time, not generally liked. So ſlowly did this excellent work, of which twelve editions have now iſſued from the preſs, gain upon the world at large, that even in the cloſing number the authour ſays, <q rend="inline">"I have never been much a favourite of the publick."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, very ſoon after its commencement, there were who felt and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged its uncommon excellence. Verſes in its praiſe appeared in the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers; and the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine mentions, in October, his having received ſeveral letters to the ſame purpoſe from the learned. <q rend="inline">"The Student, or Oxford and Cambridge Miſcellany,"</q> in which Mr. Bonnell Thornton and Mr. Colman were the principal writers, deſcribes it as <q rend="inline">"a work that exceeds any thing of the kind ever publiſhed in this kingdom, ſome of the Spectators excepted,—if indeed they may be excepted."</q> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <q rend="inline">"May the publick favours crown his merits, and may not the Engliſh, under the auſpicious reign of GEORGE the Second, neglect a man, who, had he lived in the firſt century, would have been one of the greateſt favourites of AUGUSTUS."</q> This flattery of the monarch had no effect. It is too well known, that the ſecond George never was an Auguſtus to learning or genius.</p>
               <p>Johnſon told me, with an amiable fondneſs, a little pleaſing circumſtance relative to this work. Mrs. Johnſon, in whoſe judgement and taſte he had great confidence, ſaid to him, after a few numbers of the Rambler had come out, <q rend="inline">"I thought very well of you before; but I did not imagine you could have written any thing equal to this."</q> Diſtant praiſe, from whatever quarter, is not ſo delightful as that of a wife whom a man loves and eſteems. Her approbation may be ſaid to <q rend="inline">"come home to his <hi>boſom;"</hi>
                  </q> and being ſo near, its effect is moſt ſenſible and permanent.</p>
               <p>Mr. James Elphinſton, who has ſince publiſhed various works, and who was ever eſteemed by Johnſon as a worthy man, happened to be in Scotland while the Rambler was coming out in ſingle papers at London. With a laudable zeal at once for the improvement of his countrymen and the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his friend, he ſuggeſted and took the charge of an edition of thoſe Eſſays at Edinburgh, which followed progreſſively the London publication <note n="9" place="bottom">It was executed in the printing-office of Sands, Murray, and Cochran, with uncommon elegance, upon writing paper, of a duodecimo ſize, and with the greateſt correctneſs; and Mr. Elphinſton enriched it with tranſlations of the mottos. When completed, it made eight handſome volumes. It is, unqueſtionably, the moſt accurate and beautiful edition of this work; and there being but a ſmall impreſſion, it is now become ſcarce, and ſells at a very high price.</note>.</p>

                     <p>YOU have, as I find by every kind of evidence, loſt an excellent mother; and I hope you will not think me incapable of partaking of your grief. I have a mother, now eighty-two years of age, whom, therefore, I muſt ſoon loſe, unleſs it pleaſe GOD that ſhe rather ſhould mourn for me. I read the leters in which you relate your mother's death to Mrs. Strahan, and think I do myſelf honour, when I tell you that I read them with tears; but tears are neither to <hi>you</hi> nor to <hi>me</hi> of any further uſe, when once the tribute of nature has been paid. The buſineſs of life ſummons us away from uſeleſs grief, and calls us to the exerciſe of thoſe virtues of which we are lamenting our deprivation. The greateſt benefit which one friend can confer upon another, is to guard, and excite, and elevate his virtues. This your mother will ſtill perform, if you diligently preſerve the memory of her life, and of her death: a life, ſo far as I can learn, uſeful, wiſe, and innocent; and a death reſigned, peaceful, and holy. I cannot forbear to mention, that neither reaſon nor revelation denies you to hope, that you may increaſe her happineſs by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her precepts; and that ſhe may in her preſent ſtate look with pleaſure upon every act of virtue to which her inſtructions or example have contributed. Whether this be more than a pleaſing dream, or a juſt opinion of ſeparate ſpirits, is, indeed, of no great importance to us, when we conſider ourſelves as acting under the eye of GOD: yet, ſurely, there is ſomething pleaſing in the belief, that our ſeparation from thoſe whom we love is merely corporeal; and it may be a great incitement to virtuous friendſhip, if it can be made probable, that that union that has received the divine approbation ſhall continue to eternity.</p>
                     <p>There is one expedient by which you may, in ſome degree, continue her preſence. If you write down minutely what you remember of her from your earlieſt years, you will read it with great pleaſure, and receive from it many hints of ſoothing reollection, when time ſhall remove her yet farther from you, and your grief ſhall be matured to veneration. To this, however painful for the preſent, I cannot but adviſe you, as to a ſource of comfort and ſatisfaction in the time to come; for all comfort and all ſatisfaction is ſincerely wiſhed you by, dear Sir,</p>

 The Rambler has increaſed in fame as in age. Soon after its firſt folio edition was concluded, it was publiſhed in four octavo volumes; and its authour lived to ſee ten numerous editions of it in London, beſide thoſe of Ireland and Scotland.</p>
               <p>I profeſs myſelf to have ever entertained a profound veneration for the aſtoniſhing force and vivacity of mind, which the Rambler exhibits. That Johnſon had penetration enough to ſee, and ſeeing would not diſguiſe the general miſery of man in this ſtate of being, may have given riſe to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial notion of his being too ſtern a philoſopher. But men of reflection will be ſenſible that he has given a true repreſentation of human exiſtence, and that he has, at the ſame time, with a generous benevolence, diſplayed every conſolation which our ſtate affords us; not only thoſe ariſing from the hopes of futurity, but ſuch as may be attained in the immediate progreſs through life. He has not depreſſed the ſoul to deſpondency and indifference. He has every where inculcated ſtudy, labour, and exertion. Nay, he has ſhewn, in a very odious light, a man whoſe practice is to go about darkening the views of others, by perpetual complaints of evil, and awakening thoſe conſiderations of danger and diſtreſs, which are, for the moſt part, lulled into a quiet oblivion. This he has done very ſtrongly in his character of Suſpirius <note n="2" place="bottom">No. 55.</note>, from which Goldſmith took that of Croaker, in his comedy of <q rend="inline">"The Good-natured Man,"</q> as Johnſon told me he acknowledged to him, and which is, indeed, very obvious.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0548300101:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tales, that no mind can be thought very deficient that has, by conſtant ſtudy and  meditation, aſſimilated to itſelf all that may be found there. No. 7, written in Paſſion-week on abſtraction and ſelf-examination, and No. 110, on peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and the placability of the Divine Nature, cannot be too often read. No. 54, on the effect which the death of a friend ſhould have upon us, though rather too diſpiriting, may be occaſionally very medicinal to the mind. Every one muſt ſuppoſe the writer to have been deeply impreſſed by a real ſcene; but he told me that was not the caſe, which ſhews how well his fancy could conduct him to the houſe of mourning. Some of theſe more ſolemn papers, I doubt not, particularly attracted the notice of Dr. Young, the authour of <q rend="inline">"The Night Thoughts,"</q> of whom my eſtimation is ſuch, as to reckon his applauſe an honour even to Johnſon. I have ſeen ſome volumes of Dr. Young's copy of the Rambler, in which he has marked the paſſages which he thought particularly excellent, by folding down a corner of the page; and ſuch as he rated in a ſuper-eminent degree, are marked by double folds. I am ſorry that ſome of the volumes are loſt. Johnſon was pleaſed when told of the minute attention with which Young had ſignified his approbation of his Eſſays.</p>
               <p>I will venture to ſay, that in no writings whatever can be found more <hi>bark and ſteel for the mind,</hi> if I may uſe the expreſſion; more that can brace and invigorate every manly and noble ſentiment. No. 32 on patience, even under extreme miſery, is wonderfully lofty, and as much above the rant of ſtoiciſm, as the Sun of Revelation is brighter than the twilight of Pagan phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. I never read the following ſentence without feeling my frame thrill: <q rend="inline">"I think there is ſome reaſon for queſtioning whether the body and mind are not ſo proportioned, that the one can bear all which can be inflicted on the other; whether virtue cannot ſtand its ground as long as life, and whether a ſoul well principled will not be ſooner ſeparated than ſubdued."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though inſtruction be the predominant purpoſe of the Rambler, yet it is enlivened with a conſiderable portion of amuſement. Nothing can be more erroneous than the notion which ſome perſons have entertained, that Johnſon was then a retired authour, ignorant of the world; and, of conſequence, that he wrote only from his imagination when he deſcribed characters and manners. He ſaid to me, that before he wrote that work, he had been <q rend="inline">"running about the world,"</q> as he expreſſed it, more than almoſt any body; and I have heard him relate, with much ſatisfaction, that ſeveral of the characters in the Rambler were drawn ſo naturally, that when it firſt circulated in numbers, a club in one of the towns in Eſſex imagined themſelves to be ſeverally exhibited in it, and were much incenſed againſt a perſon who, they ſuſpected, had thus
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0548300101:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 made them objects of publick notice; nor were they quieted till authenticl aſſurance was given them, that the Rambler was written by a perſon who had never heard of any one of them. Some of the characters are believed to hav been actually drawn from the life, particularly that of Proſpero from Garrick who never entirely forgave its pointed ſatire. For inſtances of fertility of fancy, and accurate deſcription of real life, I appeal to No. 19, a man who wanders from one profeſſion to another, with moſt plauſible reaſons for every change. No. 34, female faſtidiouſneſs and timorous refinement. No. 82, Virtuoſo who has collected curioſities. No. 88, petty modes of entertaining company, and conciliating kindneſs. No. 182, fortune-hunting. No. 194—195 a tutor's account of the follies of his pupil. No. 197—198, legacy-hunting He has given a ſpecimen of his nice obſervation of the mere external appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of life, in this paſſage in No. 179, againſt affectation, that frequent and moſt diſguſting quality: <q rend="inline">"He that ſtands to contemplate the crouds that fil the ſtreets of a populous city, will ſee many paſſengers whoſe air and motion it will be difficult to behold without contempt and laughter; but if he examine what are the appearances that thus powerfully excite his riſibility, he will find among them neither poverty nor diſeaſe, nor any involuntary or painful defect The diſpoſition to deriſion and inſult, is awakened by the ſoftneſs of foppery the ſwell of inſolence, the livelineſs of levity, or the ſolemnity of grandeur by the ſprightly trip, the ſtately ſtalk, the formal ſtrut, and the lofty mien by geſtures intended to catch the eye, and by looks elaborately formed a evidences of importance."</q>

               <p>Every page of the Rambler ſhews a mind teeming with claſſical alluſion and poetical imagery: illuſtrations from other writers are, upon all occaſions ſo ready, and mingle ſo eaſily in his periods, that the whole appears of one uniform vivid texture.</p>
               <p>The ſtyle of this work has been cenſured by ſome ſhallow criticks as involved and turgid, and abounding with antiquated and hard words. So ill founded is the firſt part of this objection, that I will challenge all who may honour this book with a peruſal, to point out any Engliſh writer whoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage conveys his meaning with equal force and perſpicuity. It muſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, be allowed, that the ſtructure of his ſentences is expanded, and often has ſomewhat of the inverſion of Latin; and that he delighted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs familiar thoughts in philoſophical language; being in this the reverſe of Socrates, who, it was ſaid, reduced philoſophy to the ſimplicity of common life. But let us attend to what he himſelf ſays in his concluding paper: <q rend="inline">"When common words were leſs pleaſing to the ear, or leſs diſtinct in their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0548300101:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſignification, I have familiariſed the terms of philoſophy, by applying them to  popular ideas <note n="4" place="bottom">Yet his ſtyle did not eſcape the harmleſs ſhafts of pleaſant humour; for the ingenious Bonnell Thornton publiſhed a mock Rambler in the Drury-lane Journal.</note>."</q> And, as to the ſecond part of this objection, upon a late careful reviſion of the work, I can with confidence ſay, that it is amazing how few of thoſe words, for which it has been unjuſtly characteriſed, are actually to be found in it; I am ſure, not the proportion of one to each paper. This idle charge has been echoed from one babbler to another, who have confounded Johnſon's Eſſays with Johnſon's Dictionary; and becauſe he thought it right in a Lexicon of our language to collect many words which had fallen into diſuſe, but were ſupported by great authorities, it has been imagined that all of theſe have been interwoven into his own compoſitions. That ſome of them have been adopted by him unneceſſarily, may, perhaps, be allowed; but, in general they are evidently an advantage, for without them his ſtately ideas would be confined and cramped. <q rend="inline">"He that thinks with more extent than another, will want words of larger meaning <note n="5" place="bottom">Idler, No. 70.</note>."</q> He once told me, that he had formed his ſtyle upon that of Sir William Temple, and upon Chambers's Propoſal for his Dictionary. He certainly was miſtaken; or if he imagined at firſt that he was imitating Temple, he was very unſucceſsful; for nothing can be more unlike than the ſimplicity of Temple, and the richneſs of Johnſon. Their ſtyles differ as plain cloth and brocade. Temple, indeed, ſeems equally erroneous in ſuppoſing that he himſelf had formed his ſtyle upon Sandys's Hiſtory of all Religions.</p>
               <p>The ſtyle of Johnſon was, undoubtedly, much formed upon that of the great writers in the laſt century, Hooker, Bacon, Sanderſon, Hakewell, and others; thoſe <q rend="inline">"GIANTS,"</q> as they were well characteriſed by one whoſe authority, were I to name him, would ſtamp a reverence on the opinion.</p>
               <p>We may, with the utmoſt propriety, apply to his learned ſtyle that paſſage of Horace, a part of which he has taken as the motto to his Dictionary:</p>

               <p>Yet Johnſon aſſured me, that he had not taken upon him to add more than four or five words to the Engliſh language, of his own formation; and he was very much offended at the general licence by no means <q rend="inline">"modeſtly taken"</q> in his time, not only to coin new words, but to uſe many words in ſenſes quite different from their eſtabliſhed meaning, and thoſe frequently very fantaſtical.</p>
               <p>Sir Thomas Brown, whoſe life Johnſon wrote, was remarkably fond of Anglo-Latian diction; and to his example we are to aſcribe Johnſon's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indulging himſelf in this kind of phraſeology <note n="8" place="bottom">The obſervation of his having imitated Sir Thomas Brown has been made by many people; and lately it has been inſiſted on and illuſtrated by a variety of quotations from Brown in one of the popular Eſſays written by the Reverend Mr. Knox, maſter of Tunbridge ſchool, whom I have ſet down in my liſt of thoſe who have ſometimes not unſucceſsfully imitated Dr. Johnſon's ſtyle.</note>. Johnſon's comprehenſion

of mind was the mould for his language. Had his conceptions been nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,  his expreſſion would have been eaſier. His ſentences have a dignified march; and, it is certain, that his example has given a general elevation to the language of his country, for many of our beſt writers have approached very near to him; and, from the influence which he has had upon our compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſcarcely any thing is written now that is not better expreſſed than was uſual before he appeared to lead the national taſte.</p>

               <p>Johnſon's language, however, muſt be allowed to be too maſculine for the delicate gentleneſs of female writing. His ladies, therefore, ſeem ſtrangely formal, even to ridicule; and ſeem well denominated by the names which he has given them, as, Miſella, Zozima, Properantia, Rhodoclia.</p>
               <p>It has of late been the faſhion to compare the ſtyle of Addiſon and Johnſon, and to depreciate, I think very unjuſtly, the ſtyle of Addiſon as nerveleſs and feeble, becauſe it has not the ſtrength and energy of that of Johnſon. Their proſe may be balanced like the poetry of Dryden and Pope. Both are excellent, though in different ways. Addiſon writes with the eaſe of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. His readers fancy that a wiſe and accompliſhed companion is talking to them, ſo that he inſinuates his ſentiments and taſte into their minds by an imperceptible influence. Johnſon writes like a teacher. He dictates to his readers as if from an academical chair. They attend with awe and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and his precepts are impreſſed upon them by his commanding
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0548300101:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eloquence. Addiſon's ſtyle, like a light wine, pleaſes every body from the  firſt. Johnſon's, like a liquor of more body, ſeems too ſtrong at firſt, but, by degrees, is highly reliſhed; and ſuch is the melody of his periods, ſo much do they captivate the ear, and ſeize upon the attention, that there is ſcarcely any writer, however inconſiderable, who does not aim, in ſome degree, at the ſame ſpecies of excellence. But let us not ungratefully undervalue that beautiful ſtyle, which has pleaſingly conveyed to us much inſtruction and entertainment. Though comparatively weak, when oppoſed to Johnſon's Herculean vigour, let us not call it poſitively feeble. Let us remember the character of his ſtyle, as given by Johnſon himſelf: <q rend="inline">"What he attempted, he performed; he is <hi>never feeble,</hi> and he did not wiſh to be energetick; he is never rapid, and he never ſtagnates. His ſentences have neither ſtudied amplitude, nor affected brevity: his periods, though not diligently rounded, are voluble and eaſy. Whoever wiſhes to attain an Engliſh ſtyle, familiar but not coarſe, and elegant but not oſtentatious, muſt give his days and nights to the volumes of Addiſon <note n="1" place="bottom">I ſhall probably, in another work, maintain the merit of Addiſon's poetry, which has been very unjuſtly depreciated.</note>."</q>

               <p>Though the Rambler was not concluded till the year 1752, I ſhall, under this year, ſay all that I have to obſerve upon it. Some of the tranſlations of the mottos by himſelf, are admirably done.

I cannot, however, but wiſh, that he had not ended it with an unneceſſary Greek verſe, tranſlated alſo into an Engliſh couplet. It is too much like the conceit of thoſe drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick poets, who uſed to conclude each act with a rhyme; and the expreſſion in the firſt line of his couplet, <q rend="inline">

                  </q> though proper in Pagan poetry, is ill ſuited to Chriſtianity, with a conformity to which he conſoles himſelf.

               <p>This extraordinary attempt of Lauder was no ſudden effort. He had brooded over it for many years; and to this hour it is uncertain what his principal motive was, unleſs it were a vain notion of his ſuperiority, in being able, by whatever means, to deceive mankind. To effect this, he produced certain paſſages from Grotius, Maſenius, and others, which had a faint reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to ſome parts of the <q rend="inline">"Paradiſe Loſt."</q> In theſe he interpolated ſome

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1751. Aetat. 42."/> fragments of Hog's Latin tranſlation of that poem, alledging that the maſs thus fabricated was the archetype from which Milton copied. Theſe fabrications he publiſhed from time to time in the Gentleman's Magazine; and, exulting in his fancied ſucceſs, he in 1750 ventured to collect them into a pamphlet, entitled <q rend="inline">"An Eſſay on Milton's Uſe and Imitation of the Moderns in his Paradiſe Loſt."</q> To this pamphlet Johnſon wrote a Preface, in full perſuaſion of Lauder's honeſty, and a Poſtſcript recommending, in the moſt perſuaſive terms, a ſubſcription for the relief of a grand-daughter of Milton, of whom he thus ſpeaks: <q rend="inline">"It is yet in the power of a great people to reward the poet whoſe name they boaſt, and from their alliance to whoſe genius, they claim ſome kind of ſuperiority to every other nation of the earth; that poet, whoſe works may poſſibly be read when every other monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Britiſh greatneſs ſhall be obliterated; to reward him, not with pictures or with medals, which, if he ſees, he ſees with contempt, but with tokens of gratitude, which he, perhaps, may even now conſider as not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the regard of an immortal ſpirit."</q> Surely this is inconſiſtent with <q rend="inline">"enmity towards Milton,"</q> which Sir John Hawkins imputes to Johnſon upon this occaſion, adding, <q rend="inline">"I could all along obſerve that Johnſon ſeemed to approve not only of the deſign, but of the argument; and ſeemed to exult in a perſuaſion, that the reputation of Milton was likely to ſuffer by this diſcovery. That he was not privy to the impoſture, I am well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded; but that he wiſhed well to the argument, may be inferred from the Preface, which indubitably was written by Johnſon."</q> Is it poſſible for any man of clear judgement to ſuppoſe that Johnſon, who ſo nobly praiſed the poetical excellence of Milton in a Poſtſcript to this very <q rend="inline">"diſcovery,"</q> as he then ſuppoſed it, could, at the ſame time, exult in a perſuaſion that the great poet's reputation was likely to ſuffer by it? This is an inconſiſtency of which Johnſon was incapable; nor can any thing more be fairly inferred from the Preface, than that Johnſon, who was alike diſtinguiſhed for ardent curioſity and love of truth, was pleaſed with an inveſtigation by which both were grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. That he was actuated by theſe motives, and certainly by no unworthy deſire to depreciate our great epick poet, is evident from his own words; for, after mentioning the general zeal of men of genius and literature <q rend="inline">"to advance the honour, and diſtinguiſh the beauties of Paradiſe Loſt,"</q> he ſays, <q rend="inline">"Among the inquiries to which this ardour of criticiſm has naturally given occaſion, none is more obſcure in itſelf, or more worthy of rational curioſity, than a retroſpection of the progreſs of this mighty genius in the conſtruction of his work; a view of the fabrick gradually riſing, perhaps, from ſmall beginnings,

               <p>Though Johnſon's circumſtances were at this time far from being eaſy, his humane and charitable diſpoſition was conſtantly exerting itſelf. Mrs. Anna Williams, daughter of a very ingenious Welſh phyſician, and a woman of more than ordinary talents and literature, having come to London in hopes of being cured of a cataract in both her eyes, which afterwards ended in total blindneſs, was kindly received as a conſtant viſitor at his houſe while Mrs. Johnſon lived; and after her death having come under his roof in order to have an operation upon her eyes performed with more comfort to her than in lodgings, ſhe had an apartment from him during the reſt of her life, at all times when he had a houſe.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1752"/> In 1752 he was almoſt entirely occupied with his Dictionary. The laſt paper of his Rambler was publiſhed March 2, this year; after which, there was a ceſſation for ſome time of any exertion of his talents as an eſſayiſt. But, in the ſame year, Dr. Hawkeſworth, who was his warm admirer, and a ſtudious imitator of his ſtyle, and then lived in great intimacy with him, began a periodical paper, entitled <q rend="inline">"THE ADVENTURER,"</q> in connection with other gentlemen, one of whom was Johnſon's much-loved friend, Dr. Bathurſt; and, without doubt, they received many valuable hints from his converſation, moſt of his friends having been ſo aſſiſted in the courſe of their works.</p>
               <p>That there ſhould be a ſuſpenſion of his literary labours during a part of the year 1752, will not ſeem ſtrange, when it is conſidered that ſoon after cloſing his Rambler, he ſuffered a loſs which, there there can be no doubt, affected him with the deepeſt diſtreſs. For on the 17th of March, O. S. his wife died. Why Sir John Hawkins ſhould unwarrantably take upon him even to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that Johnſon's fondneſs for her was <hi>diſſembled</hi> [meaning ſimulated or aſſumed], and to aſſert, that if it was not the caſe, <q rend="inline">"it was a leſſon he had learned by rote,"</q> I cannot conceive; unleſs it proceeded from a want of ſimilar feelings in his own breaſt. To argue from her being much older than Johnſon, or any other circumſtances, that he could not really love her, is abſurd; for love is not a ſubject of reaſoning, but of ſeeling, and therefore there are no common principles upon which one can perſuade another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

               <p>That his love for her was of the moſt ardent kind, and, during the long period of fifty years, was unimpaired by the lapſe of time, is evident from various paſſages in the ſeries of his Prayers and Meditations, publiſhed by the Reverend Mr. Strahan, as well as from other memorials, one of which I ſelect, as ſtrongly marking the tenderneſs and ſenſibility of his mind.</p>

I have, indeed, been told by Mrs. Deſmoulins, who, before her marriage,  lived for ſome time with Mrs. Johnſon at Hampſtead, that ſhe indulged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in country air and nice living, at an unſuitable expence, while her huſband was drudging in the ſmoke of London, and that ſhe by no means treated him with that complacency which is the moſt engaging quality in a wife. But all this is perfectly compatible with his fondneſs for her, eſpecially when it is remembered that he had a high opinion of her underſtanding, and that the impreſſion which her beauty, real or imaginary, had originally made upon his fancy, being continued by habit, had not been effaced, though ſhe herſelf was doubtleſs much altered for the worſe. The dreadful ſhock of ſeparation took place in the night; and he immediately diſpatched a letter to his friend, the Reverend Dr. Taylor, which, as Taylor told me, expreſſed grief in the ſtrongeſt manner he had ever read; ſo that it is much to be regretted it has not been preſerved. The letter was brought to Dr. Taylor, at his houſe in the Cloyſters, Weſtminſter, about three in the morning; and as it ſignified an earneſt deſire to ſee him, he got up, and went to Johnſon as ſoon as he was dreſſed, and found him in tears and in extreme agitation. After being a little while together, Johnſon requeſted him to join with him in prayer. He then prayed extempore, as did Dr. Taylor; and thus, by means of that piety which was ever his primary object, his troubled mind was, in ſome degree, ſoothed and compoſed.</p>

 Francis Barber, his faithful negro ſervant <note n="4" place="bottom">Francis Barber was born in Jamaica, and was brought to England in 1750 by Colonel Bathurſt, father of Johnſon's very intimate friend, Dr. Bathurſt. He was ſent, for ſome time, to the Reverend Mr. Jackſon's ſchool, at Barton in Yorkſhire. The Colonel by his will left him his freedom, and Dr. Bathurſt was willing that he ſhould enter into Johnſon's ſervice, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from 1752 till Johnſon's death, with the exception of two intervals; in one of which, upon ſome difference with his maſter, he went and ſerved an apothecary in Cheapſide, but ſtill viſited Dr. Johnſon occaſionally; in another, when he took a fancy to go to ſea. Part of the time, indeed, he was, by the kindneſs of his maſter, at a ſchool in Northamptonſhire, that he might have the advantage of ſome learning. So early and ſo laſting a connection was there between Dr. Johnſon and this humble friend.</note>, who came into his family about a fortnight after the diſmal event. Theſe ſufferings were aggravated by the melancholy inherent in his conſtitution; and although he probably was not oftener in the wrong than ſhe was, in the little diſagreements which ſometimes troubled his married ſtate, during which, he owned to me, that the gloomy irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his exiſtence was more painful to him than ever, he might very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, after her death, be tenderly diſpoſed to charge himſelf with ſlight omiſſions and offences, the ſenſe of which would give him much uneaſineſs. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we find, about a year after her deceaſe, that he thus addreſſed the Supreme Being: <q rend="inline">"O LORD, who giveſt the grace of repentance, and heareſt the prayers of the penitent, grant that by true contrition I may obtain forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all the ſins committed, and of all duties neglected in my union with the wife whom thou haſt taken from me; for the neglect of joint devotion, patient exhortation, and mild inſtruction <note n="5" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 19.</note>."</q> The kindneſs of his heart, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the impetuoſity of his temper, is well known to his friends; and I cannot trace the ſmalleſt foundation for the following dark and uncharitable aſſertion by Sir John Hawkins: <q rend="inline">"The apparition of his departed wife was altogether of the terrifick kind, and hardly afforded him a hope that ſhe was in a ſtate of happineſs <note n="6" place="bottom">Hawkins's Life of Johnſon, p. 316.</note>."</q> That he, in conformity with the opinion of many of the moſt able, learned, and pious Chriſtians in all ages, ſuppoſed that there was a middle ſtate after death, previous to the time at which departed ſouls are finally received to eternal felicity, appears, I think, unqueſtionably from his devotions: <q rend="inline">"And, O LORD, ſo far as it may be lawful in me, I commend to thy fatherly goodneſs <hi>the ſoul of my departed wife;</hi> beſeeching thee to <hi>grant</hi> her whatever is beſt in her <hi>preſent ſtate,</hi> and <hi>finally to receive her to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> 
                     <note n="7" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 20.</note>."</q> But this ſtate has not been looked upon with horrour, but only as leſs gracious.</p>

He depoſited the remains of Mrs. Johnſon in the church of Bromley in  Kent, to which he was probably led by the reſidence of his friend Hawkeſworth at that place. The funeral ſermon which he compoſed for her, which was never preached, but having been given to Dr. Taylor, has been publiſhed ſince his death, is a performance of uncommon excellence, and full of rational and pious comfort to ſuch as are depreſſed by that ſevere affliction which Johnſon felt when he wrote it. When it is conſidered that it was written in ſuch an agitation of mind, and in the ſhort interval between her death and burial, it cannot be read without wonder.</p>
               <p>From Mr. Francis Barber I have had the following authentick and artleſs account of the ſituation in which he found him recently after his wife's death: <q>He was in great affliction. Mrs. Williams was then living in his houſe, which was in Gough-ſquare. He was buſy with the Dictionary. Mr. Shiels, and ſome others of the gentlemen who had formerly written for him, uſed to come about him. He had then little for himſelf, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſent money to Mr. Shiels when in diſtreſs. The friends who viſited him at that time, were chiefly Dr. Bathurſt, and Mr. Diamond, an apothecary in Cork-ſtreet, Burlington-gardens, with whom he and Mrs. Williams generally dined every Sunday. There was a talk of his going to Iceland with him, which would probably have happened had he lived. There were alſo Mr. Cave, Dr. Hawkeſworth, Mr. Ryland, merchant on Tower-hill, Mrs. Maſters the poeteſs, who lived with Mr. Cave, Mrs. Carter, and ſometimes Mrs. Macaulay; alſo, Mrs. Gardiner, wife of a tallow-chandler on Snow-hill, not in the learned way, but a worthy good woman; Mr. (now Sir Joſhua) Reynolds; Mr. Millar, Mr. Dodſley, Mr. Bouquet, Mr. Payne of Paternoſter-row, bookſellers; Mr. Strahan the printer, the Earl of Orrery, Lord Southwell, Mr. Garrick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many are, no doubt, omitted in this catalogue of his friends, and, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, his humble friend Mr. Robert Levet, an obſcure practiſer in phyſick amongſt the lower people, his fees being ſometimes very ſmall ſums, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whatever proviſions his patients could afford him, but of ſuch extenſive practice in that way, that Mrs. Williams has told me, his walk was from Houndſditch to Marybone. It appears from Johnſon's diary, that their acquaintance commenced about the year 1746; and ſuch was Johnſon's predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for him, and fanciful eſtimation of his moderate abilities, that I have heard him ſay he ſhould not be ſatisfied, though attended by all the College of Phyſicians, unleſs he had Mr. Levet with him. Ever ſince I was acquainted with Dr. Johnſon, and many years before, as I have been aſſured by thoſe who knew him earlier, Mr. Levet had an apartment in his houſe, or his chambers,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0548300101:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 and waited upon him every morning, through the whole courſe of his late and tedious breakfaſt. He was of a ſtrange groteſque appearance, ſtiff and formal in his manner, and ſeldom ſaid a word while any company was preſent.</p>
               <p>The circle of his friends, indeed, at this time was extenſive and various, far beyond what has been generally imagined. To trace his acquaintance with each particular perſon, if it could be done, would be a taſk, of which the labour would not be repaid by the advantage. But exceptions are to be made; one of which muſt be a friend ſo eminent as Sir Joſhua Reynolds, who was truly his <hi>dulce decus,</hi> and with whom he maintained an uninterrupted intimacy to the laſt hour of his life. When Johnſon lived in Caſtle-ſtreet, Cavendiſh-ſquare, he uſed frequently to viſit two ladies, who lived oppoſite to him, Miſs Cotterells, daughters of Admiral Cotterell. Reynolds uſed alſo to viſit there, and thus they met. Mr. Reynolds, as I have obſerved above, had, from the firſt reading of his Life of Savage, conceived a very high admiration of Johnſon's powers of writing. His converſation no leſs delighted him; and he cultivated his acquaintance with the laudable zeal of one who was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of general improvement. Sir Joſhua, indeed, was lucky enough at their very firſt meeting to make a remark, which was ſo much above the common-place ſtyle of converſation, that Johnſon at once perceived that Reynolds had the habit of thinking for himſelf. The ladies were regretting the death of a friend, to whom they owed great obligations; upon which Reynolds obſerved, <q rend="inline">"You have, however, the comfort of being relieved from a burthen of gratitude."</q> They were ſhocked a little at this alleviating ſuggeſtion, as too ſelfiſh; but Johnſon defended it in his clear and forcible manner, and was much pleaſed with the <hi>mind,</hi> the fair view of human nature, which it exhibited, like ſome of the reflections of Rochefaucault. The conſequence was, that he went home with Reynolds, and ſupped with him.</p>
               <p>Sir Joſhua has told me a pleaſant characteriſtical anecdote of Johnſon about the time of their firſt acquaintance. When they were one evening together at the Miſs Cotterells, the then Ducheſs of Argyle and another lady of high rank came in. Johnſon thinking that the Miſs Cotterells were too much engroſſed by them, and that he and his friend were neglected, as low com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of whom they were ſomewhat aſhamed, grew angry; and reſolving to ſhock their ſuppoſed pride, by making their great viſiters imagine that his friend and he were low indeed, he addreſſed himſelf in a loud tone to Mr. Reynolds, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"How much do you think you and I could get in a week, if we were to <hi>work as hard</hi> as we could?"</q> as if they had been common mechanicks.</p>

His acquaintance with Bennet Langton, Eſq. of Langton, in Lincolnſhire, another much valued friend, commenced ſoon after the concluſion of his Rambler, which that gentleman, then a youth, had read with ſo much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he came to London chiefly with the view of endeavouring to be introduced to its authour. By a fortunate chance he happened to take lodgings in a houſe where Mr. Levet frequently viſited; and having mentioned his wiſh to his landlady, ſhe introduced him to Mr. Levet, who readily obtained Johnſon's permiſſion to bring Mr. Langton to him; as, indeed, Johnſon, during the whole courſe of his life, had no ſhyneſs, real or affected, but was eaſy of acceſs to all who were properly recommended, and even wiſhed to ſee numbers at his <hi>levee,</hi> as his morning circle of company might, with ſtrict propriety, be called. Mr. Langton was exceedingly ſurprized when the ſage firſt appeared. He had not received the ſmalleſt intimation of his figure, dreſs, or manner. From peruſing his writings, he fancied he ſhould ſee a decent, well-dreſt, in ſhort, a remarkably decorous philoſopher. Inſtead of which, down from his bed-chamber, about noon, came, as newly riſen, a huge uncouth figure, with a little dark wig which ſcarcely covered his head, and his clothes hanging looſe about him. But his converſation was ſo rich, ſo animated, and ſo forcible, and his religious and political notions ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial with thoſe in which Mr. Langton had been educated, that he conceived for him that veneration and attachment which he ever preſerved. Johnſon was not the leſs ready to love Mr. Langton, for his being of a very ancient family; for I have heard him ſay, with pleaſure, <q rend="inline">"Langton, Sir, has a grant of a warren from Henry the Second; and Cardinal Stephen Langton, in King John's reign, was of this family."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Langton afterwards went to purſue his ſtudies at Trinity College, Oxford, where he formed an acquaintance with his fellow-ſtudent, Mr. Topham Beauclerk, who, though their opinions and modes of life were ſo different, that it ſeemed utterly improbable that they ſhould at all agree, had ſo ardent a love of literature, ſo acute an underſtanding, ſuch elegance of manners, and ſo well diſcerned the excellent qualities of Mr. Langton, that they became intimate friends.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, ſoon after this acquaintance began, paſſed a conſiderable time at Oxford. He at firſt thought it ſtrange that Langton ſhould aſſociate ſo much with one who had the character of being looſe, both in his principles and practice; but, by degrees, he himſelf was faſcinated. Mr. Beauclerk's being of the St. Albans' family, and having, in ſome particulars, a reſemblance to Charles the Second, contributed, in Johnſon's imagination, to throw a luſtre
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0548300101:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 upon his other qualities; and, in a ſhort time, the moral, pious Johnſon, and the gay, diſſipated Beauclerk, were companions. <q rend="inline">"What a coalition! (ſaid Garrick, when he heard of this;) I ſhall have my old friend to bail out of the Round-houſe."</q> But I can bear teſtimony that it was a very agreeable aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Beauclerk was too polite, and valued learning and wit too much, to offend Johnſon by ſallies of infidelity or licentiouſneſs; and Johnſon delighted in the good qualities of Beauclerk, and hoped to correct the evil. Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable were the ſcenes in which Johnſon was amuſed by theſe young men. Beauclerk could take more liberty with him, than any body with whom I ever ſaw him; but, on the other hand, Beauclerk was not ſpared by his reſpectable companion, when reproof was proper. Beauclerk had ſuch a propenſity to ſatire, that at one time Johnſon ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"You never open your mouth but with intention to give pain; and you have often given me pain, not from the power of what you ſaid, but from ſeeing your intention."</q> At another time applying to him, with a ſlight alteration, a line of Pope, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Thy love of folly, and thy ſcorn of fools—Every thing thou doſt ſhews the one, and every thing thou ſay'ſt the other."</q> At another time he ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Thy body is all vice, and thy mind all virtue."</q> Beauclerk not ſeeming to reliſh the compliment, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, Alexander the Great, marching in triumph into Babylon, could not have deſired to have had more ſaid to him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon was ſome time with Beauclerk at his houſe at Windſor, where he was entertained with experiments in natural philoſophy. One Sunday, when the weather was very fine, Beauclerk enticed him, inſenſibly, to ſaunter about all the morning. They went into a church-yard, in the time of divine ſervice, and Johnſon laid himſelf down at his eaſe upon one of the tomb-ſtones. <q rend="inline">"Now, Sir, (ſaid Beauclerk) you are like Hogarth's Idle Apprentice."</q> When Johnſon got his penſion, Beauclerk ſaid to him, in the humorous phraſe of Falſtaff, <q rend="inline">"I hope you'll now purge, and live cleanly like a gentleman."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One night when Beauclerk and Langton had ſupped at a tavern in London, and ſat till about three in the morning, it came into their heads to go and knock up Johnſon, and ſee if they could prevail on him to join them in a ramble. They rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple, till at laſt he appeared in his ſhirt, with his little black wig on the top of his head, inſtead of a nightcap, and a poker in his hand, imagining, probably, that ſome ruffians were coming to attack him. When he diſcovered who they were, and was told their errand, he ſmiled, and with great good humour agreed to their propoſal: <q rend="inline">"What, is it you, you dogs! I'll have a friſk with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0548300101:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you."</q> He was ſoon dreſt, and they ſallied forth together into Covent-Garden, where the green-grocers and fruiterers were beginning to arrange their hampers, juſt come in from the country. Johnſon made ſome attempts to help them; but the honeſt gardeners ſtared ſo at his figure and manner, and odd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that he ſoon ſaw his ſervices were not reliſhed. They then repaired to one of the neighbouring taverns, and made a bowl of that liquor called <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which Johnſon had always liked; while in joyous contempt of ſleep, from which he had been rouſed, he repeated the feſtive lines,
<q>
                     <l>"Short, O ſhort then be thy reign,</l>
                     <l>"And gve us to the world again!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They did not ſtay long, but walked down to the Thames, took a boat, and rowed to Billingſgate. Beauclerk and Johnſon were ſo well pleaſed with their amuſement, that they reſolved to perſevere in diſſipation for the reſt of the day: but Langton deſerted them, being engaged to breakfaſt with ſome young ladies. Johnſon ſcolded him for <q rend="inline">"leaving his ſocial friends, to go and ſit with a ſet of wretched <hi>un-idea'd</hi> girls."</q> Garrick being told of this ramble, ſaid to him ſmartly, <q rend="inline">"I heard of your frolick t'other night. You'll be in the Chronicle."</q> Upon which Johnſon afterwards obſerved, <q rend="inline">

                  <p>
                     <date>Jan. 1, 1753, N. S.</date> which I ſhall uſe for the future.</p>
                  <p>Almighty GOD, who haſt continued my life to this day, grant that, by the aſſiſtance of thy Holy Spirit, I may improve the time which thou ſhalt grant me, to my eternal ſalvation. Make me to remember, to thy glory, thy judgements and thy mercies. Make me ſo to conſider the loſs of my wife, whom thou haſt taken from me, that it may diſpoſe me, by thy grace, to lead the reſidue of my life in thy fear. Grant this, O LORD, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake. Amen.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He now relieved the drudgery of his Dictionary, and the melancholy of his grief, by taking an active part in the compoſition of <q rend="inline">"The Adventurer,"</q> in which he began to write April 10, marking his eſſays with the ſignature T, by which moſt of his papers in that collection are diſtinguiſhed: thoſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which have that ſignature and alſo that of <hi>Myſargyrus,</hi> were not written by him, but, as I ſuppoſe, by Dr. Bathurſt. Indeed Johnſon's energy of

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1753. Aetat. 44."/> thought and richneſs of language, are ſtill more deciſive marks than any ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As a proof of this, my readers, I imagine, will not doubt that No. 39, on ſleep, is his; for it not only has the general texture and colour of his ſtyle, but the authours with whom he was peculiarly converſant are readily introduced in it in curſory alluſion. The tranſlation of a paſſage in Statius quoted in that paper, and marked C. B. is certainly the performance of Dr. Charles Bathurſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How much this amiable man actually contributed to <q rend="inline">"The Adventurer,"</q> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known. Let me add, that Hawkeſworth's imitations of Johnſon are ſometimes ſo happy, that it is extremely difficult to diſtinguiſh them, with certainty, from the compoſitions of his great archetype. Hawkeſworth was his cloſeſt imitator, a circumſtance of which that writer would once have been proud to be told; though, when he had become elated by having riſen into ſome degree of conſequence, he, in a converſation with me, had the provoking effrontery to ſay he was not ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>Johnſon was truly zealous for the ſucceſs of <q rend="inline">"The Adventurer;"</q> and very ſoon after his engaging in it, he wrote the following letter</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                     <p>I OUGHT to have written to you before now, but I ought to do many things which I do not; nor can I, indeed, claim any merit from this letter; for being deſired by the authours and proprietor of the Adventurer to look out for another hand, my thoughts neceſſarily fix'd upon you, whoſe fund of literature will enable you to aſſiſt them, with very little interruption of your ſtudies.</p>
                     <p>They deſire you to engage to furniſh one paper a month, at two guineas a paper, which you may very readily perform. We have conſidered that a paper ſhould conſiſt of pieces of imagination, pictures of life, and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of literature. The part which depends on the imagination is very well ſupplied, as you will find when you read the paper; for deſcriptions of life, there is now a treaty almoſt made with an authour and an authoreſs; and the province of criticiſm and literature they are very deſirous to aſſign to the commentator on Virgil.</p>
                     <p>I hope this propoſal will not be rejected, and that the next poſt will bring us your compliance. I ſpeak as one of the fraternity, though I have no part in the paper, beyond now and then a motto; but two of the writers

               <p>The conſequence of this letter was, Dr. Warton's enriching the collection with ſeveral admirable eſſays.</p>
               <p>Johnſon's ſaying <q rend="inline">"I have no part in the paper beyond now and then a motto,"</q> may ſeem inconſiſtent with his being the authour of the papers marked T. But he had, at this time, written only one number; and beſides, even at any after period, he might have uſed the ſame expreſſion, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as a point of honour not to own them; for Mrs. Williams told me, that <q rend="inline">"as he had <hi>given</hi> thoſe eſſays to Dr. Bathurſt, who ſold them at two guineas each, he never would own them; nay, he uſed to ſay he did not <hi>write</hi> them: but the fact was, that he <hi>dictated</hi> them, while Bathurſt wrote."</q> I read to him Mrs. Williams's account; he ſmiled, and ſaid nothing.</p>
               <p>I am not quite ſatisfied with the caſuiſtry by which the productions of one perſon are thus paſſed upon the world for the productions of another. I allow that not only knowledge, but powers and qualities of mind may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; but the actual effect of individual exertion never can be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, with truth, to any other than its own original cauſe. One perſon's child may be made the child of another perſon by adoption, as among the Romans, or by the ancient Jewiſh mode of a wife having children borne to her upon her knees, by her handmaid. But theſe were children in a different ſenſe from that of nature. It was clearly underſtood that they were not of the blood of their nominal parents. So in literary children, an authour may give the profits and fame of his compoſition to another man, but cannot make that other the real authour. A Highland gentleman, a younger branch of a family, once conſulted me if he could not validly purchaſe the Chieftainſhip of his family, from the Chief who was willing to ſell it. I told him it was impoſſible for him to acquire, by purchaſe, a right to be a different perſon from what he really was; for that the right of Chieftainſhip attached to the blood of primo-geniture, and, therefore, was incapable of being transferred. I added, that though Eſau ſold his birth-right, or the advantages belonging to it, he ſtill remained the firſt-born of his parents; and that whatever agreement a Chief might make with any of the clan, the Herald's Office could not admit of the metamorphoſis, or with any decency atteſt that the younger was the elder; but I did not convince the worthy gentleman.</p>

 Johnſon's papers in the Adventurer are very fimilar to thoſe of the Rambler; but being rather more varied in their ſubjects, and being mixed with eſſays by other writers, upon topicks more generally attractive than even the moſt elegant ethical diſcourſes, the ſale of the work, at firſt, was more extenſive. Without meaning, however, to depreciate the Adventurer, I muſt obſerve, that as the value of the Rambler came, in the progreſs of time, to be better known, it grew upon the publick eſtimation, and that its ſale has far exceeded that of any other periodical papers ſince the reign of Queen Anne.</p>
               <p>In one of the books of his diary I find the following entry:</p>

                  <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1754"/> In 1754 I can trace nothing publiſhed by him, except his numbers of the Adventurer, and <q rend="inline">"The Life of Edward Cave,"</q> in the Gentleman's Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine for February. In biography there can be no queſtion that he excelled, beyond all who have attempted that ſpecies of compoſition; upon which, indeed, he ſet the higheſt value. To the minute ſelection of characteriſtical circumſtances, for which the ancients were remarkable, he added a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical reſearch, and the moſt perſpicuous and energetick language. Cave was certainly a man of eſtimable qualities, and was eminently diligent and ſucceſsful in his own buſineſs, which, doubtleſs, entitled him to reſpect. But he was peculiarly fortunate in being recorded by Johnſon, who, of the narrow life of a printer and publiſher, without any digreſſions or adventitious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, has made an intereſting and agreeable narrative.</p>
               <p>The Dictionary, we may believe, afforded Johnſon full occupation this year. As it approached to its concluſion, he probably worked with redoubled vigour, as ſeamen increaſe their exertion and alacrity when they have a near proſpect of their haven.</p>
               <p>Lord Cheſterfield, to whom Johnſon had paid the high compliment of addreſſing to his Lordſhip the Plan of his Dictionary, had behaved to him in ſuch a manner as to excite his contempt and indignation. The world has been for many years amuſed with a ſtory confidently told, and as confidently repeated with additional circumſtances, that a ſudden diſguſt was taken by Johnſon upon occaſion of his having been one day kept long in waiting in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0548300101:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
antechamber, for which the reaſon aſſigned was, that he had company <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1754. Aetat. 45."/> with him; and that at laſt, when the door opened, out walked Colley Cibber; and that Johnſon was ſo violently provoked when he found for whom he had been ſo long excluded, that he went away in a paſſion, and never would return. I remember having mentioned this ſtory to George Lord Lyttelton, who told me, he was very intimate with Lord Cheſterfield; and holding it as a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known truth, defended Lord Cheſterfield, by ſaying, that <q rend="inline">"Cibber, who had been introduced familiarly by the back-ſtairs, had probably not been there above ten minutes."</q> It may ſeem ſtrange even to entertain a doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtory ſo long and ſo widely current, and thus implicitly adopted, if not ſanctified, by the authority which I have mentioned; but Johnſon himſelf aſſured me, that there was not the leaſt foundation for it. He told me, that there never was any particular incident which produced a quarrel between Lord Cheſterfield and him; but that his Lordſhip's continued neglect was the reaſon why he reſolved to have no connection with him. When the Dictionary was upon the eve of publication, Lord Cheſterfield, who, it is ſaid, had flattered himſelf with expectations that Johnſon would dedicate the work to him, attempted, in a courtly manner, to ſooth, and inſinuate himſelf with the ſage, conſcious, as it ſhould ſeem, of the cold indifference with which he had treated its learned authour; and further attempted to conciliate him, by writing two papers in <q rend="inline">"The World,"</q> in recommendation of the work; and it muſt be confeſſed, that they contain ſome ſtudied compliments, ſo finely turned, that if there had been no previous offence, it is probable that Johnſon would have been highly delighted. Praiſe, in general, was pleaſing to him; but by praiſe from a man of rank and elegant accompliſhments, he was peculiarly gratified.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip ſays, <q rend="inline">"I think the publick in general, and the republick of letters in particular, are greatly obliged to Mr. Johnſon, for having undertaken, and executed, ſo great and deſirable a work. Perfection is not to be expected from man: but if we are to judge by the various works of Johnſon already publiſhed, we have good reaſon to believe, that he will bring this as near to perfection as any one man could do. The Plan of it, which he publiſhed ſome years ago, ſeems to me to be a proof of it. Nothing can be more rationally imagined, or more accurately and elegantly expreſſed. I therefore recommend the previous peruſal of it to all thoſe who intend to buy the Dictionary, and who, I ſuppoſe, are all thoſe who can afford it.</q>

                  <p>It muſt be owned, that our language is, at preſent, in a ſtate of anarchy, and hitherto, perhaps, it may not have been the worſe for it. During our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0548300101:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 free and open trade, many words and expreſſions have been imported, adopted and naturalized from other languages, which have greatly enriched our own. Let it ſtill preſerve what real ſtrength and beauty it may have borrowed from others; but let it not, like the Tarpeian maid, be overwhelmed and cruſhed by unneceſſary ornaments. The time for difcrimination ſeems to be now come. Toleration, adoption, and naturalization have run their lengths. Good order and authority are now neceſſary. But where ſhall we find them, and, at the ſame time, the obedience due to them? We muſt have recourſe to the old Roman expedient in times of confuſion, and chuſe a dictator. Upon this principle, I give my vote for Mr. Johnſon to fill that great and arduous poſt. And I hereby declare, that I make a total ſurrender of all my rights and privileges in the Engliſh language, as a free-born Britiſh ſubject, to the ſaid Mr. Johnſon, during the term of his dictatorſhip. Nay more, I will not only obey him, like an old Roman, as my dictator, but, like a modern Roman, I will implicitly believe in him as my Pope, and hold him to be infallible while in the chair, but no longer. More than this he cannot well require; for, I preſume, that obedience can never be expected, when there is neither terrour to enforce, nor intereſt to invite it.</p>

                  <p>But a Grammar, a Dictionary, and a Hiſtory of our Language through its ſeveral ſtages, were ſtill wanting at home, and importunately called for from abroad. Mr. Johnſon's labours will now, I dare ſay, very fully ſupply that want, and greatly contribute to the farther ſpreading of our language in other countries. Learners were diſcouraged, by finding no ſtandard to reſort to; and, conſequently, thought it incapable of any. They will now be undeceived and encouraged.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This courtly device failed of its effect. Johnſon, who thought that <q rend="inline">"all was falſe and hollow,"</q> deſpiſed the honeyed words, and was even indignant that Lord Cheſterfield ſhould, for a moment, imagine, that he could be the dupe of ſuch an artifice. His expreſſion to me concerning Lord Cheſterfield, upon this occaſion, was, <q rend="inline">"Sir, after making great profeſſions, he had, for many years, taken no notice of me; but when my Dictionary was coming out, he fell a ſcribbling in the World about it. Upon which, I wrote him a letter, expreſſed in civil terms, but ſuch as might ſhew him that I did not mind what he ſaid or wrote, and that I had done with him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is that celebrated letter, of which ſo much has been ſaid, and about which curioſity has been ſo long excited, without being gratified. I for many years ſolicited Johnſon to favour me with a copy of it, that ſo excellent a

compoſition might not be loſt to poſterity. He delayed from time to time to give it me; till at laſt in 1781, when we were on a viſit at Mr. Dilly's, at Southill in Bedfordſhire, he was pleaſed to dictate it to me from memory. He afterwards found among his papers a copy of it, with its title and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, in his own hand-writing. This he gave to Mr. Langton; adding, that if it were to come into print, he wiſhed it to be from that copy. By Mr. Langton's kindneſs, I am enabled to enrich my work with a perfect tranſcript of what the world has ſo eagerly deſired to ſee.</p>

                     <p>When, upon ſome ſlight encouragement, I firſt viſited your Lordſhip, I was overpowered, like the reſt of mankind, by the enchantment of your addreſs; and could not forbear to wiſh that I might boaſt myſelf <hi>Le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre;</hi>—that I might obtain that regard for which I ſaw the world contending; but I found my attendance ſo little encouraged, that neither pride nor modeſty would ſuffer me to continue it. When I had once addreſſed your Lordſhip in publick, I had exhauſted all the art of pleaſing which a retired and uncourtly ſcholar can poſſeſs. I had done all that I could; and no man is well pleaſed to have his all neglected, be it ever ſo little.</p>
                     <p>Seven years, my Lord, have now paſt, ſince I waited in your outward rooms, or was repulſed from your door; during which time I have been puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my work through difficulties, of which it is uſeleſs to complain, and have brought it, at laſt, to the verge of publication, without one act of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note n="8" place="bottom">The following note is ſubjoined by Mr. Langton. <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon, when he gave me this copy of his letter, deſired that I would annex to it his information to me, that whereas it is ſaid in the ltter that 'no aſſiſtance has been received,' he did once receive from Lord Cheſterfield the ſum of ten pounds; but as that was ſo inconſiderable a ſum, he thought the mention of it could not properly find place in a letter of the kind that this was."</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"While this was the talk of the town, (ſays Dr. Adams, in a letter to me) I happened to viſit Dr. Warburton, who finding that I was acquainted with Johnſon, deſired me earneſtly to carry his compliments to him, and to tell him, that he honoured him for his manly behaviour in rejecting theſe conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions of Lord Cheſterfield, and for reſenting the treatment he had received from him, with a proper ſpirit. Johnſon was viſibly pleaſed with this compliment,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0548300101:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for he had always a high opinion of Warburton."</q>—Indeed, the force of mind  which appeared in this letter, was congenial with that which Warburton himſelf amply poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>There is a curious minute circumſtance which ſtruck me, in comparing the various editions of Johnſon's imitations of Juvenal. In the tenth Satire, one of the couplets upon the vanity of wiſhes even for literary diſtinction ſtood thus:
<q>
                     <l>"Yet think what ills the ſcholar's life aſſail,</l>
                     <l>"Pride, envy, want, the <hi>garret,</hi> and the jail."</l>
                  </q>
But after experiencing the uneaſineſs which Lord Cheſterfield's fallacious patronage made him feel, he diſmiſſed the word <hi>garret</hi> from the ſad group, and in all the ſubſequent editions the line ſtands
<q>
                     <l>"Pride, envy, want, the <hi>Patron,</hi> and the jail."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That Lord Cheſterfield muſt have been mortified by the lofty contempt, and polite, yet keen ſatire with which Johnſon exhibited him to himſelf in this letter, it is impoſſible to doubt. He, however, with that gloſſy duplicity which was his conſtant ſtudy, affected to be quite unconcerned. Dr. Adams mentioned to Mr. Robert Dodſley that he was ſorry Johnſon had written his letter to Lord Cheſterfield. Dodſley, with the true feelings of trade, ſaid <q rend="inline">"he was very ſorry too; for that he had a property in the Dictionary, to which his Lordſhip's patronage might have been of conſequence."</q> He then told Dr. Adams, that Lord Cheſterfield had ſhewn him the letter. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould have imagined (replied Dr. Adams) that Lord Cheſterfield would have concealed it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Poh! (ſaid Dodſley) do you think a letter from Johnſon could hurt Lord Cheſterfield? Not at all, Sir. It lay upon his table, where any body might ſee it. He read it to me; ſaid, 'this man has great powers,' pointed out the ſevereſt paſſages, and obſerved how well they were expreſſed."</q> This air of indifference, which impoſed upon the worthy Dodſley, was certainly nothing but a ſpecimen of that diſſimulation which Lord Cheſterfield inculcated as one of the moſt eſſential leſſons for the conduct of life. His Lordſhip endeavoured to juſtify himſelf to Dodſley from the charges brought againſt him by Johnſon; but we may judge of the flimſineſs of his defence, from his having excuſed his neglect of Johnſon, by ſaying that <q rend="inline">"he had heard he had changed his lodgings, and did not know where he lived;"</q> as if there could have been the ſmalleſt difficulty to inform himſelf of that circumſtance, by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0548300101:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 inquiring in the literary circle with which his Lordſhip was well acquainted, and was, indeed, himſelf one of its ornaments.</p>
               <p>Dr. Adams expoſtulated with Johnſon, and ſuggeſted, that his not being admitted when he called on him, was, probably, not to be imputed to Lord Cheſterfield; for his Lordſhip had declared to Dodſley, that <q rend="inline">"he would have turned off the beſt ſervant he ever had, if he had known that he denied him to a man who would have been always more than welcome;"</q> and, in confirmation of this, he inſiſted on Lord Cheſterfield's general affability and eaſineſs of acceſs, eſpecially to literary men. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon) that is not Lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; he is the proudeſt man this day exiſting."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"No, (ſaid Dr. Adams) there is one perſon, at leaſt, as proud; I think, by your own account, you are the prouder man of the two."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"But mine (replied Johnſon, inſtantly) was <hi>defenſive</hi> pride."</q> This, as Dr. Adams well obſerved, was one of thoſe happy turns for which he was ſo remarkably ready.</p>
               <p>Johnſon having now explicitly avowed his opinion of Lord Cheſterfield, did not refrain from expreſſing himſelf concerning that nobleman with pointed freedom: <q rend="inline">"This man (ſaid he) I thought had been a Lord among wits; but, I find, he is only a wit among Lords!"</q> And when his Letters to his natural ſon were publiſhed, he obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of a dancing-maſter <note n="2" place="bottom">That collection of letters cannot be vindicated from the ſerious charge of encouraging, in ſome paſſages, one of the vices moſt deſtructive to the good order and comfort of ſociety, which his Lordſhip repreſents as mere faſhionable gallantry; and, in others, of inculcating the baſe practice of diſſimulation, and recommending, with diſproportionate anxiety, a perpetual attention to external elegance of manner. But it muſt, at the ſame time be allowed, that they contain many good precepts of conduct, and much genuine information upon life and manners, very happily expreſſed; and that there was conſiderable merit in paying ſo much attention to the improvement of one who was dependent upon his Lordſhip's protection; it has, probably, been exceeded in no inſtance by the moſt exemplary parent; and though I can by no means approve of confounding the diſtinction between lawful and illicit offspring, which is, in effect, inſulting the civil eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our country, to look no higher; I cannot help thinking it laudable to be kindly attentive to thoſe, of whoſe exiſtence we have, in any way, been the cauſe. Mr. Stanhope's character has been unjuſtly repreſented as diametrically oppoſite to what Lord Cheſterfield wiſhed him to be. He has been called dull, groſs, and aukward: but I knew him at Dreſden, when he was Envoy to that court; and though he could not boaſt of the <hi>graces,</hi> he was, in truth, a ſenſible, civil, well-behaved man.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The character of a <q rend="inline">"reſpectable Hottentot,"</q> in Lord Cheſterfield's letters, has been generally underſtood to be meant for Johnſon, and I have no doubt that it was. But I remember when the <hi>Literary Property</hi> of thoſe letters was
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0548300101:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conteſted in the Court of Seſſion in Scotland, and Mr. Henry Dundas, one of the Counſel for the proprietors, read this character as an exhibition of Johnſon, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, one of the Judges, maintained, with ſome warmth, that it was not intended as a portrait of Johnſon, but of a late noble Lord, diſtinguiſhed for abſtruſe ſcience. I have heard Johnſon himſelf talk of the character, and ſay that it was meant for George Lord Lyttelton, in which I could by no means agree; for his Lordſhip had nothing of that violence which is a conſpicuous feature in the compoſition. Finding that my illuſtrious friend could bear to have it ſuppoſed that it might be meant for him, I ſaid, laughingly, that there was one trait which unqueſtionably did not belong to him; <q rend="inline">"he throws his meat any where but down his throat."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) Lord Cheſterfield never ſaw me eat in his life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the 6th of March came out Lord Bolingbroke's works, publiſhed by Mr. David Mallet. The wild and pernicious ravings, under the name of <q rend="inline">"Philoſophy,"</q> which were thus uſhered into the world, gave great offence to all well-principled men. Johnſon, hearing of their tendency, which nobody diſputed, was rouſed with a juſt indignation, and pronounced this memorable ſentence upon the noble authour and his editor. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he was a ſcoundrel, and a coward: a ſcoundrel, for charging a blunderbuſs againſt religion and morality; a coward, becauſe he had not reſolution to fire it off himſelf, but left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman, to draw the trigger after his death!"</q> Garrick, who I can atteſt from my own knowledge, had his mind ſeaſoned with pious reverence, and ſincerely diſapproved of the infidel writings of ſeveral, whom, in the courſe of his almoſt univerſal gay intercourſe with men of eminence, he treated with external civility, diſtinguiſhed himſelf upon this occaſion. Mr. Pelham having died on the very day on which Lord Bolingbroke's works came out, he wrote an elegant Ode on his death, beginning

               <p>Of his converſation while at Oxford at this time, Mr. Warton has preſerved and communicated to me the following memorial, which, though not written
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0548300101:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with all the care and attention which that learned and elegant writer beſtows on thoſe compoſitions which he intends for the publick eye, is ſo happily expreſſed in an eaſy ſtyle, that I ſhould injure it by any alteration:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>When Johnſon came to Oxford in 1754, the long vacation was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and moſt people were leaving the place. This was the firſt time of his being there, after quitting the Univerſity. The next morning after his arrival, he wiſhed to ſee his old College, <hi>Pembroke.</hi> I went with him. He was highly pleaſed to find all the College-ſervants which he had left there ſtill remaining, particularly a very old butler; and expreſſed great ſatisfaction at being recogniſed by them, and converſed with them familiarly. He waited on the maſter, Dr. Radcliffe, who received him very coldly. Johnſon at leaſt expected, that the maſter would order a copy of his Dictionary, now near publication: but the maſter did not chooſe to talk on the ſubject, never aſked Johnſon to dine, nor even to viſit him, while he ſtayed at Oxford. After we had left the Lodgings, Johnſon ſaid to me, <hi>'There</hi> lives a man, who lives by the revenues of literature, and will not move a finger to ſupport it. If I come to live at Oxford, I ſhall take up my abode at Trinity.' We then called on the Reverend Mr. Meeke, one of the fellows, and of Johnſon's ſtanding. Here was a moſt cordial greeting on both ſides. On leaving him, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I uſed to think Meeke had excellent parts, when we were boys together at the College: but, alas!
<q>
                           <l>'Loſt in a convent's ſolitary gloom!'</l>
                        </q>
I remember, at the claſſical lecture in the Hall, I could not bear Meeke's ſuperiority, and I tried to ſit as far from him as I could, that I might not hear him conſtrue.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As we were leaving the College, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Here I tranſlated Pope's Meſſiah. Which do you think is the beſt line in it? My own favourite is,
<q>
                           <l>'Vallis aromaticas fundit Saronica nubes.'</l>
                        </q>
                     </q>
I told him, I thought it a very ſonorous hexameter. I did not tell him, it was not in the Virgilian ſtyle. He much regretted that his <hi>firſt</hi> tutor was dead; for whom he ſeemed to retain the greateſt regard. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I once had been a whole morning ſliding <hi>[ſkating]</hi> in Chriſt-Church Meadow, and miſſed his lecture in logick. After dinner, he ſent for me to his room. I expected a ſharp rebuke for my idleneſs, and went with a beating heart. When we were ſeated, he told me he had ſent for me to drink a glaſs of wine with him, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0548300101:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 to tell me, he was <hi>not</hi> angry with me for miſſing his lecture. This was, in fact, a moſt ſevere reprimand. Some more of the boys were then ſent for, and we ſpent a very pleaſant afternoon.'</q> Beſides Mr. Meeke, there was only one other Fellow of Pembroke now reſident: from both of whom Johnſon received the greateſt civilities during this viſit, and they preſſed him very much to have a room in the College.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of this viſit (1754), Johnſon and I walked, three or four times, to Ellsfield, a village beautifully ſituated about three miles from Oxford, to ſee Mr. Wiſe, Radclivian librarian, with whom Johnſon was much pleaſed. At this place, Mr. Wiſe had fitted up a houſe and gardens, in a ſingular manner, but with great taſte. Here was an excellent library; particularly, a valuable collection of books in Northern literature, with which Johnſon was often very buſy. One day Mr. Wiſe read to us a diſſertation which he was preparing for the preſs, intitled, 'A Hiſtory and Chronology of the fabulous Ages.' Some old divinities of Thrace, related to the Titans, and called the CABIRI, made a very important part of the theory of this piece; and in converſation afterwards, Mr. Wiſe talked much of his CABIRI. As we returned to Oxford in the evening, I out-walked Johnſon, and he cried out <hi>Sufflamina,</hi> a Latin word which came from his mouth with peculiar grace, and was as much as to ſay, <hi>Put on your drag-chain.</hi> Before we got home, I again walked too faſt for him; and he now cried out, <q rend="inline">'Why, you walk as if you were purſued by all the CABIRI in a body.'</q> In an evening, we frequently took long walks from Oxford into the country, returning to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Once, in our way home, we viewed the ruins of the abbies of Oſeney and Rewley, near Oxford. After at leaſt half an hour's ſilence, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I viewed them with indignation!'</q> We had then a long converſation on Gothick buildings; and in talking of the form of old halls, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'In theſe halls, the fire-place was anciently always in the middle of the room, till the Whigs removed it on one ſide.'</q>—About this time there had been an execution of two or three criminals at Oxford on a Monday. Soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, one day at dinner, I was ſaying that Mr. Swinton the chaplain of the gaol, and alſo a frequent preacher before the Univerſity, a learned man, but often thoughtleſs and abſent, preached the condemnation-ſermon on repentance, before the convicts, on the preceding day, Sunday: and that in the cloſe he told his audience, that he ſhould give them the remainder of what he had to ſay on the ſubject, the next Lord's Day. Upon which, one of our company, a Doctor of Divinity, and a plain matter-of-fact-man, by way of offering an apology for Mr. Swinton, gravely remarked, that he had probably preached
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0548300101:180"/>

When Dr. Johnſon was with me at Oxford, in 1755, he gave to the Bodleian Library a thin quarto of twenty-one pages, a work in Italian, with an Engliſh tranſlation on the oppoſite page. The Engliſh title-page is this: 'An Account of an Attempt to aſcertain the Longitude at Sea, by an exact Variation of the Magnetical Needle, &amp;c. By Zachariah Williams. London, printed for Dodſley, 1755.' The Engliſh tranſlation, from the ſtrongeſt internal marks, is unqueſtionably the work of Johnſon. In a blank leaf, Johnſon has written the age, and time of death, of the authour Z. Williams, as I have ſaid above. On another blank leaf, is paſted a paragraph from a newſpaper, of the death and character of Williams, which is plainly written by Johnſon. He was very anxious about placing this book in the Bodleian: and, for fear of any omiſſion or miſtake, he entered, in the great Catalogue, the title-page of it, with his own hand."</q>

But if Polypheme comes, have at his eyes.

               <p>Dr. Adams told me, that this ſcheme of a <hi>Bibliotheque</hi> was a ſerious one; for upon his viſiting him one day, he found his parlour floor covered with parcels of foreign and Engliſh literary journals, and he told Dr. Adams he meant to undertake a Review. <q rend="inline">"How, Sir, (ſaid Dr. Adams, can you think of doing it alone? All branches of knowledge muſt be conſidered in it. Do you know Mathematicks? Do you know Natural Hiſtory?"</q> Johnſon anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I muſt do as well as I can. My chief purpoſe is to give my countrymen a view of what is doing in literature upon the continent; and I ſhall have, in a good meaſure, the choice of my ſubject, for I ſhall ſelect ſuch books as I beſt underſtand."</q> Dr. Adams ſuggeſted, that as Dr. Maty had juſt then finiſhed his <hi>Bibliotheque Britannique,</hi> which was a well executed work, giving foreigners an account of Britiſh publications, he might, with great advantage, aſſume him as an aſſiſtant. <q rend="inline">

               <p>Mr. Andrew Millar, bookſeller in the Strand, took the principal charge of conducting the publication of Johnſon's Dictionary; and as the patience of the proprietors was repeatedly tried and almoſt exhauſted, by their expecting that the work would be completed within the time which Johnſon had ſanguinely ſuppoſed, the learned authour was often goaded to diſpatch, more eſpecially as he had received all the copy-money, by different drafts, a conſiderable time before he had finiſhed his taſk. When the meſſenger who carried the laſt ſheet to Millar returned, Johnſon aſked him, <q rend="inline">"Well, what did he ſay?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Sir, (anſwered the meſſenger) he ſaid, thank GOD I have done with him.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

 is remarkable, that thoſe with whom Johnſon chiefly contracted for his literary labours were Scotchmen, Mr. Millar and Mr. Strahan. Millar, though himſelf no great judge of literature, had good ſenſe enough to have for his friends very able men to give him their opinion and advice in the purchaſe of copy-right; the conſequence of which was his acquiring a very large fortune, with great liberality. Johnſon ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">"I reſpect Millar, Sir; he has raiſed the price of literature."</q> The ſame praiſe may be juſtly given to Pancoek, the eminent bookſeller of Paris.

               <p>The Dictionary, with a Grammar and Hiſtory of the Engliſh Language, being now at length publiſhed, in two volumes folio, the world contemplated with wonder ſo ſtupendous a work atchieved by one man, while other countries had thought ſuch undertakings fit only for whole academies. Vaſt as his powers were, I cannot but think that his imagination deceived him, when he ſuppoſed that by conſtant application he might have performed the taſk in three years. Let the Preface be attentively peruſed, in which is given, in a clear, ſtrong, and glowing ſtyle, a comprehenſive, yet particular view of what he had done; and it will be evident, that the time he employed upon it was comparatively ſhort. I am unwilling to ſwell my book with long quotations from what is in every body's hands; and I believe there are few proſe compoſitions in the Engliſh language that are read with more delight, or are more impreſſed upon the memory, than that preliminary diſcourſe. One of its excellencies has always ſtruck me with peculiar admiration; I mean the perſpicuity with which he has expreſſed abſtract ſcientifick notions. As an inſtance of this, I ſhall quote the following ſentence: <q rend="inline">"When the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, how can a conſecutive ſeries be formed of ſenſes in their own nature collateral?"</q> We have here an example of what has been often ſaid, and I believe with juſtice, that there is for every thought a certain nice adaptation of words which none other could equal, and which, when a man has been ſo fortunate as to hit, he has attained, in that particular caſe, to the perfection of language.</p>
               <p>The extenſive reading which was abſolutely neceſſary for the accumulation of authorities, and which alone may account for Johnſon's retentive mind being enriched with a very large and various ſtore of knowledge and imagery, muſt have occupied ſeveral years. The Preface furniſhes an eminent inſtance of a double talent, of which Johnſon was fully conſcious. Sir Joſhua Reynolds
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0548300101:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has heard him ſay, <q rend="inline">"There are two things which I am confident I can do very well: one is an introduction to any literary work, ſtating what it is to contain, and how it ſhould be executed in the moſt perfect manner; the other is a concluſion, ſhewing from various cauſes why the execution has not been equal to what the authour promiſed to himſelf and to the publick."</q>
               </p>
               <p>How ſhould puny ſcribblers be abaſhed and diſappointed, when they find him diſplaying a perfect theory of lexicographical excellence, yet at the ſame time candidly and modeſtly allowing that he <q rend="inline">"had not ſatisfied his own expectations."</q> Here was a fair occaſion for the exerciſe of Johnſon's modeſty, when he was called upon to compare his own arduous performance, not with thoſe of other individuals, (in which caſe his inflexible regard to truth would have been violated, had he affected diffidence,) but with ſpeculative perfection; as he, who can outſtrip all his competitors in the race, may yet be ſenſible of his deficiency when he runs againſt time. Well might he ſay, that <q rend="inline">"the Engliſh Dictionary was written with little aſſiſtance of the learned;"</q> for he told me, that the only aid which he received was a paper containing twenty etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, ſent to him by a perſon then unknown, who he was afterwards informed was Dr. Pearce, Biſhop of Rocheſter. The etymologies, though they exhibit learning and judgement, are not, I think, entitled to the firſt praiſe amongſt the various parts of this immenſe work. The definitions have always appeared to me ſuch aſtoniſhing proofs of acuteneſs of intellect and preciſion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as indicate a genius of the higheſt rank. This it is which marks the ſuperiour excellence of Johnſon's Dictionary over others equally or even more voluminous, and muſt have made it a work of much greater mental labour than mere Lexicons, or <hi>Word Books,</hi> as the Dutch call them. They, who will make the experiment of trying how they can define a few words of whatever nature, will ſoon be ſatisfied of the unqueſtionable juſtice of this obſervation, which I can aſſure my readers is founded upon much ſtudy, and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with more minds than my own.</p>
               <p>A few of his definitions muſt be admitted to be erroneous. Thus, <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Leeward,</hi> though directly of oppoſite meaning, are defined identically the ſame way; as to which inconſiderable ſpecks it is enough to obſerve, that his Preface announces that he was aware there might be many ſuch in ſo immenſe a work; nor was he at all diſconcerted when an inſtance was pointed out to him. A lady once aſked him how he came to define <hi>Paſtern</hi> the <hi>knee</hi> of a horſe: inſtead of making an elaborate defence, as ſhe expected, he at once anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Ignorance, Madam, pure ignorance."</q> His definition of <hi>Network</hi> has been often quoted with ſportive malignity, as obſcuring a thing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0548300101:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> in itſelf very plain. But to theſe frivolous cenſures no other anſwer is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than that with which we are furniſhed by his own Preface. <q rend="inline">"To explain, requires the uſe of terms leſs abſtruſe than that which is to be explained, and ſuch terms cannot always be found. For as nothing can be proved but by ſuppoſing ſomething intuitively known, and evident without proof, ſo nothing can be defined but by the uſe of words too plain to admit of definition. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eaſier words are changed into harder; as, <hi>burial,</hi> into <hi>ſepulture</hi> or <hi>interment; dry,</hi> into <hi>deſiecative; dryneſs,</hi> into <hi>ſiccity</hi> or <hi>aridity; fit,</hi> into <hi>paroxyſm;</hi> for, the <hi>eaſieſt</hi> word, whatever it be, can never be tranſlated into one more eaſy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His introducing his own opinions, and even prejudices, under general definitions of words, while at the ſame time the original meaning of the words is not explained, as his <hi>Tory, Whig, Penſion, Oats, Exciſe,</hi> and a few more, cannot be fully defended, and muſt be placed to the account of capricious and humourous indulgence. Talking to me upon this ſubject when we were at Aſhbourne in 1777, he mentioned a ſtill ſtronger inſtance of the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his private feelings in the compoſition of this work, than any now to be found in it. <q rend="inline">"You know, Sir, Lord Gower forſook the old Jacobite intereſt. When I came to the word <hi>Renegado,</hi> after telling that it meant 'one who deſerts to the enemy, a revolter,' I added, <hi>Sometimes we ſay a</hi> GOWER. Thus it went to the preſs; but the printer had more wit than I, and ſtruck it out."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let it, however, be remembered, that this indulgence does not diſplay itſelf only in ſarcaſm towards others, but ſometimes in playful alluſion to the notions commonly entertained of his own laborious taſk. Thus: <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Grub-ſtreet,</hi> the name of a ſtreet in London, much inhabited by writers of ſmall hiſtories, <hi>dictionaries,</hi> and temporary poems; whence any mean production is called <hi>Grub-ſtreet.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"<hi>Lexicographer,</hi> a writer of dictionaries, a <hi>harmleſs drudge."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At the time when he was concluding his very eloquent Preface, Johnſon's mind appears to have been in ſuch a ſtate of depreſſion, that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template without wonder the vigorous and ſplendid thoughts which ſo highly diſtinguiſh that performance. <q rend="inline">"I (ſays he) may ſurely be contented without the praiſe of perfection, which if I could obtain in this gloom of ſolitude, what would it avail me? I have protracted my work till moſt of thoſe whom I wiſhed to pleaſe, have ſunk into the grave; and ſucceſs and miſcarriage are empty ſounds. I therefore diſmiſs it with frigid tranquillity, having little to fear or hope from cenſure or from praiſe."</q> That this indifference was rather
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0548300101:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a temporary than an habitual feeling, appears, I think, from his letters to Mr. Warton; and however he may have been affected for the moment, certain it is that the honours which his great work procured him, both at home and abroad, were very grateful to him. His friend the Earl of Corke and Orrery, being at Florence, preſented it to the <hi>Academia della Cruſca.</hi> That Academy ſent Johnſon their <hi>Vocabulario,</hi> and the French Academy ſent him their <hi>Dictionnaire,</hi> which Mr. Langton had the pleaſure to convey to him.</p>
               <p>It muſt undoubtedly ſeem ſtrange, that the concluſion of his Preface ſhould be expreſſed in terms ſo deſponding, when it is conſidered that the authour was then only in his forty-ſixth year. But we muſt aſcribe its gloom to that miſerable dejection of ſpirits to which he was conſtitutionally ſubject, and which was aggravated by the death of his wife two years before. I have heard it ingeniouſly obſerved by a lady of rank and elegance, that <q rend="inline">"his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly was then at its meridian."</q> It pleaſed GOD to grant him almoſt thirty years of life after this time; and once, when he was in a placid frame of mind, he was obliged to own to me that he had enjoyed happier days, and had had many more friends, ſince that gloomy hour than before.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad ſaying, that <q rend="inline">"moſt of thoſe whom he wiſhed to pleaſe had ſunk into the grave,"</q> and his caſe at forty-five was ſingularly unhappy, unleſs the circle of his friends was very narrow. I have often thought, that as longevity is generally deſired, and, I believe, generally expected, it would be wiſe to be continually adding to the number of our friends, that the loſs of ſome may be ſupplied by others. Friendſhip, <q rend="inline">"the wine of life,"</q> ſhould, like a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocked cellar, be thus continually renewed; and it is conſolatory to think, that although we can ſeldom add what will equal the generous <hi>firſt-growths</hi> of our youth, yet friendſhip becomes inſenſibly old in much leſs time than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not many years are required to make it very mellow and pleaſant. Warmth will, no doubt, make a conſiderable difference. Men of affectionate temper and bright fancy will coaleſce a great deal ſooner than thoſe who are cold and dull.</p>
               <p>The propoſition which I have now endeavoured to illuſtrate was, at an after period of his life, the opinion of Johnſon himſelf. He ſaid to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, <q rend="inline">"If a man does not make new acquaintance as he advances through life, he will ſoon find himſelf left alone. A man, Sir, ſhould keep his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in <hi>conſtant repair."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The celebrated Mr. Wilkes, whoſe notions and habits of life were very oppoſite to his, but who was ever eminent for literature and vivacity, ſallied forth with a little <hi>Jeu d' Eſprit</hi> upon the following paſſage in his Grammar of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0548300101:197" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Engliſh Tongue, prefixed to the Dictionary: <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"H</hi> ſeldom, perhaps never, begins any but the firſt ſyllable."</q> In an eſſay printed in the Publick Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſer, this lively writer enumerated many inſtances in oppoſition to this remark; for example, <q rend="inline">"The authour of this obſervation muſt be a man of a quick <hi>appre-henſion,</hi> and of a moſt <hi>compre-henſive</hi> genius."</q> The poſition is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly expreſſed with too much latitude.</p>
               <p>This light ſally, we may ſuppoſe, made no great impreſſion on our Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cographer, for we find that he never altered the paſſage.</p>

Mr. Williams had followed the profeſſion of phyſick in Wales; but having a very ſtrong propenſity to the ſtudy of natural philoſophy, had made many ingenious advances towards a diſcovery of the longitude, and repaired to London in hopes of obtaining the great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary reward. He failed of ſucceſs; but Johnſon having made himſelf

maſter of his principles and experiments, wrote for him a pamphlet, publiſhed in quarto, with the following title; <q rend="inline">"An Account of an Attempt to aſcertain the Longitude at Sea, by an exact Theory of the Variation of the magnetical Needle; with a Table of the Variations at the moſt remarkable Cities in Europe, from the year 1660 to 1860."</q> To diffuſe it more extenſively, it was accompanied with an Italian tranſlation on the oppoſite page, which it is ſuppoſed was the work of Signor Baretti, an Italian of conſiderable literature, who having come to England a few years before, had been employed in the capacity both of a language-maſter and an authour, and formed an intimacy with Dr. Johnſon.

                     <q rend="inline">"On Saturday the 12th, about twelve at night, died Mr. Zachariah Williams, in his eighty-third year, after an illneſs of eight months, in full poſſeſſion of his mental faculties. He has been long known to philoſophers and ſeamen for his ſkill in magnetiſm, and his propoſal to aſcertain the longitude by a peculiar ſyſtem of the variation of the compaſs. He was a man of induſtry indefatigable, of converſation inoffenſive, patient of adverſity and diſcaſe, eminently ſober, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and pious; and worthy to have ended life with better fortune."</q>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>In July this year he had formed ſome ſcheme of mental improvement, the particular purpoſe of which does not appear. But we find in his <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> p. 24, a prayer entitled <q rend="inline">"On the Study of Philoſophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as an Inſtrument of living;"</q> and after it follows a note, <q rend="inline">"This ſtudy was not purſued."</q>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1756"/> In 1756 Johnſon found that the great fame of his Dictionary had not ſet him above the neceſſity of <q rend="inline">"making proviſion for the day that was paſſing over him."</q> No royal or noble patron extended a munificent hand to give independence to the man who had conferred ſtability on the language of his country. We may feel indignant that there ſhould have been ſuch unworthy neglect; but we muſt, at the ſame time, congratulate ourſelves, that to this very neglect, operating to rouſe the natural indolence of his conſtitution, we owe many valuable productions, which otherwiſe, perhaps, might never have appeared.</p>
               <p>He had ſpent, during the progreſs of the work, the money for which he had contracted to write his Dictionary. We have ſeen that the reward of his labour was only fifteen hundred and ſeventy-five pounds; and when the expence of amanuenſes and paper, and other articles are deducted, his clear profit was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0548300101:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1756. Aetat. 47."/> very inconſiderable. I once ſaid to him <q rend="inline">"I am ſorry, Sir, you did not get more for your Dictionary."</q> His anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"I am ſorry too. But it was very well. The bookſellers are generous liberal-minded men."</q> He, upon all occaſions, did ample juſtice to their character in this reſpect. He conſidered them as the patrons of literature; and, indeed, although they have eventually been conſiderable gainers by his Dictionary, it is to them that we owe its having been undertaken and carried through at the riſk of great expence, for they were not abſolutely ſure of being indemnified.</p>
               <p>On the firſt day of this year we find from his private devotions, that he had then recovered from ſickneſs <note n="6" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 25.</note>; and in February that his eye was reſtored to its uſe <note n="7" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 27.</note>. The pious gratitude with which he acknowledges mercies upon every occaſion is very edifying; as is the humble ſubmiſſion which he breathes when it is the will of his heavenly Father to try him with afflictions. As ſuch diſpoſitions become the ſtate of man here, and are the true effects of religious diſcipline, we cannot but venerate in Johnſon one of the moſt exerciſed minds that our holy religion hath ever formed. If there be any thoughtleſs enough to ſuppoſe ſuch exerciſe the weakneſs of a great underſtanding, let them look up to Johnſon, and be convinced that what he ſo earneſtly practiſed muſt have a rational foundation.</p>
               <p>His works this year were, an abſtract or epitome, in octavo, of his folio Dictionary, and a few eſſays in a monthly publication, entitled, <q rend="inline">"THE UNIVERSAL VISITER."</q> Chriſtopher Smart, with whoſe unhappy vacillation of mind he ſincerely ſympathiſed, was one of the ſtated undertakers of this miſcellany; and it was to aſſiſt him that Johnſon ſometimes employed his pen. All the eſſays marked with two <hi>aſteriſks</hi> have been aſcribed to him; but I am confident, from internal evidence, that of theſe, neither <q rend="inline">"The Life of Chaucer,"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Reflections on the State of Portugal,"</q> nor an <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on Architecture,"</q> were written by him. I am equally confident, upon the ſame evidence, that he wrote <q rend="inline">"Further Thoughts on Agriculture, †"</q> being the ſequel of a very inferiour eſſay on the ſame ſubject, and which, though carried on as if by the ſame hand, is both in thinking and expreſſion ſo far above it, and ſo ſtrikingly peculiar, as to leave no doubt of its true parent; and that he alſo wrote <q rend="inline">"A Diſſertation on the State of Literature and Authours, †"</q> and <q rend="inline">"A Diſſertation on the Epitaphs written by Pope. †"</q> The laſt of theſe, indeed, he afterwards added to his <q rend="inline">"Idler."</q> Why the eſſays truly written by him are marked in the ſame manner with ſome he did not write, I cannot explain; but with diference to thoſe who have aſcribed to him the three eſſays which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0548300101:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I have rejected, they want all the characteriſtical marks of Johnſonian compoſition.</p>
               <p>He engaged alſo to ſuperintend and contribute largely to another monthly publication, entitled <q rend="inline">"THE LITERARY MAGAZINE, OR UNIVERSAL REVIEW;"</q> the firſt number of which came out in May this year. What were his emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from this undertaking, and what other writers were employed in it, I have not diſcovered. He continued to write in it, with intermiſſions, till the fifteenth number; and I think that he never gave better proofs of the force, acuteneſs, and vivacity of his mind, than in this miſcellany, whether we conſider his original eſſays, or his reviews of the works of others. The <q rend="inline">"Preliminary Addreſs"</q> to the publick is a proof how this great man could embelliſh even ſo trite a thing as the plan of a magazine with the graces of ſuperiour compoſition.</p>
               <p>His original eſſays are, <q rend="inline">"An Introduction to the political State of Great-Britain; †"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Remarks on the Militia Bill; †"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Obſervations on his Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Majeſty's Treaties with the Empreſs of Ruſſia and the Landgrave of Heſſe Caſſel; †</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Obſervations on the preſent State of Affairs; †"</q> and, <q rend="inline">"Memoirs of Frederick III. King of Pruſſia. †"</q> In all theſe he diſplays extenſive political knowledge and ſagacity, expreſſed with uncommon energy and perſpicuity, without any of thoſe words which he ſometimes took a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in adopting, in imitation of Sir Thomas Browne, of whoſe <q rend="inline">"Chriſtian Morals"</q> he this year gave an edition, with his <q rend="inline">"Life*"</q> prefixed to it, which is one of Johnſon's beſt biographical performances. In one inſtance only in theſe eſſays has he indulged his <hi>Browniſm.</hi> Dr. Robertſon, the hiſtorian, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it to me, as having at once convinced him that Johnſon was the authour of the <q rend="inline">"Memoirs of the King of Pruſſia."</q> Speaking of the pride which the old King, the father of his hero, took in being maſter of the talleſt regiment in Europe, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"To review this <hi>towering</hi> regiment was his daily pleaſure, and to perpetuate it was ſo much his care, that when he met a tall woman he immediately commanded one of his <hi>Titanian</hi> retinue to marry her, that they might <hi>propagate procerity."</hi>
                  </q> For this Anglo-Latian word <hi>procerity,</hi> Johnſon had, however, the authority of Addiſon.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"A Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil. *"</q> All theſe, from internal evidence, were written by Johnſon; ſome of them I know he avowed, and have marked them with an <hi>aſteriſk</hi> accordingly. Mr. Thomas Davies, indeed, aſcribed to him the Review of Mr. Burke's <q rend="inline">"Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful;"</q> and Sir John Hawkins, with equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, has inſerted it in his collection of Johnſon's works. Whereas it has no reſemblance to Johnſon's compoſition, and is well known to have been written by Mr. Murphy, who has acknowledged it to me and many others.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of remark, in juſtice to Johnſon's political character, which has been miſrepreſented as abjectly ſubmiſſive to power, that his <q rend="inline">"Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the preſent State of Affairs,"</q> glow with as animated a ſpirit of conſtitutional liberty as can be found any where. Thus he begins, <q rend="inline">"The time is now come, in which every Engliſhman expects to be informed of the national affairs, and in which he has a right to have that expectation gratified. For whatever may be urged by miniſters, or thoſe whom vanity or intereſt make the followers of miniſters, concerning the neceſſity of confidence in our governours, and the preſumption of prying with profane eyes into the receſſes of policy, it is evident that this reverence can be claimed only by counſels yet unexecuted, and projects ſuſpended in deliberation. But when a deſign has ended in miſcarriage or ſucceſs, when every eye and every ear is witneſs to general diſcontent, or general ſatisfaction, it is then a proper time to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle confuſion and illuſtrate obſcurity, to ſhew by what cauſes every event was produced, and in what effects it is likely to terminate; to lay down with diſtinct particularity what rumour always huddles in general exclamation, or perplexes by indigeſted narratives; to ſhew whence happineſs or calamity is derived, and whence it may be expected; and honeſtly to lay before the people what inquiry can gather of the paſt, and conjecture can eſtimate of the future."</q>

Here we have it aſſumed as an incontrovertible principle, that in this country the people are the ſuperintendants of the conduct and meaſures of thoſe by whom government is adminiſtered, of the beneficial effect of which the preſent reign afforded an illuſtrious example, when addreſſes from all parts of the kingdom controuled an audacious attempt to introduce a new power ſubverſive of the crown.</p>
               <p>A ſtill ſtronger proof of his patriotick ſpirit appears in his review of an <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on Waters, by Dr. Lucas;"</q> of whom, after deſcribing him as a man well known to the world for his daring defiance of power, when he thought it exerted on the ſide of wrong, he thus ſpeaks: <q rend="inline">"The Iriſh miniſters drove him from his native country by a proclamation, in which they charged him with crimes of which they never intended to be called to the proof, and oppreſſed him by methods equally irreſiſtible by guilt and innocence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Let the man thus driven into exile for having been the friend of his country, be received in every other place as a confeſſor of liberty; and let the tools of power be taught in time, that they may rob, but cannot impoveriſh."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some of his reviews in this magazine are very ſhort accounts of the pieces noticed, and I mention them only that Dr. Johnſon's opinion of the works may be known; but many of them are examples of elaborate criticiſm, in the moſt maſterly ſtyle. In his review of the <q rend="inline">"Memoirs of the Court of Auguſtus,"</q> he has the reſolution to think and ſpeak from his own mind, regardleſs of the cant tranſmitted from age to age, in praiſe of the ancient Romans. Thus: <q rend="inline">"I know not why any one but a ſchool-boy in his declamation ſhould whine over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Rome, which grew great only by the miſery of the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Romans, like others, as ſoon as they grew rich, grew corrupt; and in their corruption ſold the lives and freedoms of themſelves, and of one another."</q> Again, <q rend="inline">"A people, who while they were poor robbed mankind; and as ſoon as they became rich, robbed one another."</q> In his review of the Miſcellanies in proſe and verſe, publiſhed by Elizabeth Harriſon, but written by many hands, he gives an eminent proof at once of his orthodoxy and candour. <q rend="inline">"The authours of the eſſays in proſe ſeem generally to have imitated, or tried to imitate, the copiouſneſs and luxuriance of Mrs. <hi>Rowe.</hi> This, however, is not all their praiſe; they have laboured to add to her brightneſs of imagery, her purity of ſentiments. The poets have had Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> before their eyes; a writer, who, if he ſtood not in the firſt claſs of genius, compenſated that defect by a ready application of his powers to the promotion of piety. The attempt to employ the ornaments of romance in the decoration of religion, was, I think, firſt made by Mr. <hi>Boyle's Martyrdom of Theodora;</hi> but <hi>Boyle's</hi> philoſophical
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0548300101:203" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtudies did not allow him time for the cultivation of ſtyle; and the completion of the great deſign was reſerved for Mrs. <hi>Rowe.</hi> Dr. Watts was one of the firſt who taught the Diſſenters to write and ſpeak like other men, by ſhewing them that elegance might conſiſt with piety. They would have both done honour to a better ſociety, for they had that charity which might well make their failings be forgotten, and with which the whole Chriſtian world might wiſh for communion. They were pure from all the hereſies of an age, to which every opinion is become a favourite that the univerſal church has hitherto deteſted!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"This praiſe, the general intereſt of mankind requires to be given to writers who pleaſe and do not corrupt, who inſtruct and do not weary. But to them all human eulogies are vain, whom I believe applauded by angels, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with the juſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His defence of tea againſt Mr. Jonas Hanway's violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage, ſhews how very well a man of genius can write upon the ſlighteſt ſubject, when he writes, as the Italians ſay, <hi>can amore:</hi> I ſuppoſe no perſon ever enjoyed with more reliſh the infuſion of that fragrant leaf than Johnſon. The quantities which he drank of it at all hours were ſo great, that his nerves muſt have been uncommonly ſtrong, not to have been extremely relaxed by ſuch an intemperate uſe of it. He aſſured me, that he never felt the leaſt inconvenience from it; which is a proof that the fault of his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was rather a too great tenſion of fibres, than the contrary. Mr. Hanway wrote an angry anſwer to Johnſon's review of his Eſſay on Tea, and Johnſon, after a full and deliberate pauſe, made a reply to it; the only inſtance, I believe, in the whole courſe of his life, when he condeſcended to oppoſe any thing that was written againſt him. I ſuppoſe when he thought of any of his little antagoniſts, he was ever juſtly aware of the high ſentiment of Ajax in Ovid:
<q>
                     <l>"Iſte tulit pretium jam nunc certaminis hujus,</l>
                     <l>"Qui, cùm victus erit, mecum certaſſe feretur."</l>
                  </q>
But, indeed, the good Mr. Hanway laid himſelf ſo open to ridicule, that Johnſon's animadverſions upon his attack were chiefly to make ſport.</p>
               <p>The generoſity with which he pleads the cauſe of Admiral Byng is highly to the honour of his heart and ſpirit. Though <hi>Voltaire</hi> affects to be witty upon the fate of that unfortunate officer, obſerving that he was ſhot <q rend="inline">

               </q>
               <p>Johnſon's moſt exquiſite critical eſſay in the Literary Magazine, and indeed any where, is his review of Soame Jennings's <q rend="inline">"Inquiry into the Origin of Evil."</q> Jennings was poſſeſſed of lively talents, and a ſtyle eminently pure and eaſy, and could very happily play with a light ſubject, either in proſe or verſe; but when he ſpeculated on that moſt difficult and excruciating queſtion, the Origin of Evil, he <q rend="inline">"ventured far beyond his depth,"</q> and, accordingly, was expoſed by Johnſon, both with acute argument and brilliant wit. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when the late Mr. Bicknell's humourous performance, entitled <q rend="inline">"The Muſical Travels of Joel Collyer,"</q> in which a ſlight attempt is made to ridicule Johnſon, was aſcribed to Soame Jennings, <q rend="inline">"Ha!

                           <p>Some time after Dr. Johnſon's death there appeared in the newſpapers and magazines an illiberal and petulant attack upon him, in the form of an Epitaph, under the name of Mr. Soame Jennings, very unworthy of that gentleman, who had quietly ſubmitted to the critical laſh while Johnſon lived. It aſſumed, as characteriſticks of him, all the vulgar circumſtances of abuſe which had circulated amongſt the ignorant. It was an unbecoming indulgence of puny reſentment, at a time when he himſelf was at a very advanced age, and had a near proſpect of deſcending to the grave. I was truly ſorry for it; for he was then become an avowed, and (as my Lord Biſhop of London, who had a ſerious converſation with him on the ſubject, aſſures me) a ſincere Chriſtian. He could not expect that Johnſon's numerous friends would patiently bear to have the memory of their maſter ſtigmatized by no mean pen, but that at leaſt one would be found to retort. Accordingly, this unjuſt and ſarcaſtick Epitaph was met in the ſame publick field by an anſwer, in terms by no means ſoft, and ſuch as wanton provocation only could juſtify:</p>

               <p>This year Mr. William Payne, brother of the reſpectable bookſeller of that name, publiſhed <q rend="inline">"An Introduction to the Game of Draughts,"</q> to which Johnſon contributed a Dedication to the Earl of Rochford, * and a Preface, * both of which are admirably adapted to the treatiſe to which they are prefixed. Johnſon, I believe, did not play at draughts after leaving College, by which he ſuffered, for it would have afforded him an innocent ſoothing relief from the melancholy which diſtreſſed him ſo often. I have heard him regret that he had not learnt to play at cards; and the game of draughts we know is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly calculated to fix the attention without ſtraining it. There is a compoſure and gravity in draughts which inſenſibly tranquilliſes the mind; and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the Dutch are fond of it, as they are of ſmoaking, of the ſedative
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0548300101:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
influence of which, though he himſelf never ſmoaked, he had a high opinion <note n="9" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 48.</note>.  Beſides, there is in draughts ſome exerciſe of the faculties; and, accordingly, Johnſon wiſhing to dignify the ſubject in his Dedication with what is moſt eſtimable in it, obſerves, <q rend="inline">"Triflers may find or make any thing a trifle; but ſince it is the great characteriſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As one of the little occaſional advantages which he did not diſdain to take by his pen, as a man whoſe profeſſion was literature, he this year accepted of a guinea from Mr. Robert Dodſley, for writing the introduction to <q rend="inline">"The London Chronicle,"</q> an evening newſpaper; and even in ſo ſlight a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance exhibited peculiar talents. This Chronicle ſtill ſubſiſts, and from what I obſerved, when I was abroad, has a more extenſive circulation upon the Continent than any of the Engliſh newſpapers. It was conſtantly read by Johnſon himſelf; and it is but juſt to obſerve, that it has all along been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for good ſenſe, accuracy, moderation, and delicacy.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of the ſame nature has been communicated to me by the Reverend Dr. Thomas Campbell, who has done himſelf conſiderable credit by his own writings. <q rend="inline">"Sitting with Dr. Johnſon one morning alone, he aſked me if I had known Dr. Madden, who was authour of the premium-ſcheme in Ireland. On my anſwering in the affirmative, and alſo that I had for ſome years lived in his neighbourhood, &amp;c. he begged of me that when I returned to Ireland, I would endeavour to procure for him a poem of Dr. Madden's, called 'Boulter's Monument.' The reaſon (ſaid he) why I wiſh for it, is this: when Dr. Madden came to London, he ſubmitted that work to my caſtigation; and I remember I blotted a great many lines, and might have blotted many more, without making the poem the worſe. However, the Doctor was very thankful, and very generous, for he gave me ten guineas, <hi>which was to me at that time a great ſum."</hi>

               <p>He this year reſumed his ſcheme of giving an edition of Shakſpeare with notes. He iſſued Propoſals of conſiderable length, in which he ſhewed that he perfectly well knew what a variety of reſearch ſuch an undertaking required; but his indolence prevented him from purſuing it with that diligence which alone can collect thoſe ſcattered facts that genius, however acute, penetrating, and luminous, cannot diſcover by its own force. It is remarkable, that at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0548300101:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 this time his fancied activity was for the moment ſo vigorous, that he promiſed his work ſhould be publiſhed before Chriſtmas, 1757. Yet nine years elapſed before it ſaw the light. His throes in bringing it forth had been ſevere and remittent, and at laſt we may almoſt conclude that the Caeſarian operation was performed by the knife of Churchill, whoſe upbraiding ſatire, I dare ſay, made Johnſon's friends urge him to diſpatch.</p>

               <p>About this period he was offered a living of conſiderable value in Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, if he were inclined to enter into holy orders. It was a rectory in the gift of Mr. Langton, the father of his much valued friend. But he did not accept of it; partly I believe from a conſcientious motive, being perſuaded that his temper and habits rendered him unfit for that aſſiduous and familiar inſtruction of the vulgar and ignorant, which he held to be an eſſential duty in a clergyman; and partly becauſe his love of a London life was ſo ſtrong, that he would have thought himſelf an exile in any other place, particularly if reſiding in the country.

                     <p>I HAVE lately, by the favour of Mr. Faulkner, ſeen your account of Ireland, and cannot forbear to ſolicit a proſecution of your deſign. Sir William Temple complains that Ireland is leſs known than any other country, as to its ancient ſtate. The natives have had little leiſure, and little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for enquiry; and ſtrangers, not knowing the language, have had no ability.</p>
                     <p>I have long wiſhed that the Iriſh literature were cultivated. Ireland is known by tradition to have been once the ſeat of piety and learning; and ſurely it would be very acceptable to all thoſe who are curious either in the original of nations, or the affinities of Languages, to be further informed of the revolutions of a people ſo ancient, and once ſo illuſtrious.</p>
                     <p>What relation there is between the Welch and Iriſh languages, or between the language of Ireland and that of Biſcay, deſerves enquiry. Of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and unextended tongues, it ſeldom happens that more than one are underſtood by any one man; and, therefore, it ſeldom happens that a fair compariſon can be made. I hope you will continue to cultivate this kind of learning, which has lain too long neglected, and which, if it be ſuffered to remain in oblivion for another century, may, perhaps, never be retrieved. As I wiſh well to all uſeful undertakings, I would not forbear to let you know how much you deſerve, in my opinion, from all lovers of ſtudy, and how much pleaſure your work has given to, Sir,</p>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Soon after this, Mr. Burney, during a viſit to the capital, had an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with him in Gough-ſquare, where he dined and drank tea with him, and was introduced to the acquaintance of Mrs. Williams. After dinner, Mr. Johnſon propoſed to Mr. Burney to go up with him into his garret, which being accepted, he there found about five or ſix Greek folios, a deal writing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſk, and a chair and a half. Johnſon giving to his gueſt the entire ſeat, tottered himſelf on one with only three legs and one arm. Here he gave Mr. Burney Mrs. Williams's hiſtory, and ſhewed him ſome volumes of his Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare already printed, to prove that he was in earneſt. Upon Mr. Burney's opening the firſt volume, at the Merchant of Venice, he obſerved to him, that he ſeemed to be more ſevere on Warburton than Theobald. 'O poor Tib.! (ſaid Johnſon) he was ready knocked down to my hands; Warburton ſtands between me and him.' 'But, Sir, (ſaid Mr. Burney,) you'll have Warburton upon your bones, won't you?' 'No, Sir; he'll not come out: he'll only growl in his den.' 'But you think, Sir, that Warburton is a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour critick to Theobald?'—'O, Sir, he'd make two-and-fifty Theobalds, cut into ſlices! The worſt of Warburton is, that he has a rage for ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when there's nothing to be ſaid.'—Mr. Burney then aſked him whether he had ſeen the letter which Warburton had written in anſwer to a pamphlet addreſſed 'To the moſt impudent Man alive.' He anſwered in the negative. Mr. Burney told him it was ſuppoſed to be written by Mallet. The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy now raged between the friends of Pope and Bolingbroke; and Warburton and Mallet were the leaders of the ſeveral parties. Mr. Burney aſked him then
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0548300101:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>On the fifteenth of April he began a new periodical paper, entitled <q rend="inline">"THE IDLER, *"</q> which came out every Saturday in a weekly newſpaper, called <q rend="inline">"The Univerſal Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette,"</q> publiſhed by Newberry. Theſe eſſays were continued till April 5, 1760. Of one hundred and three, their total number, twelve were contributed by his friends; of which, Numbers 33, 93, and 96, were written by Mr. Thomas Warton; No. 67 by Mr. Langton; and No. 76, 79, and 82 by Sir Joſhua Reynolds; the concluding words of No. 82, <q rend="inline">"and pollute his canvas with deformity,"</q> being added by Johnſon, as Sir Joſhua informed me.</p>
               <p>The IDLER is evidently the work of the ſame mind which produced the RAMBLER, but has leſs body, and more ſpirit. It has more variety of real life, and greater facility of language. He deſcribes the miſeries of idleneſs, with the lively ſenſations of one who had felt them; and in his private memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums while engaged in it, we find <q rend="inline">"This year I hope to learn diligence <note n="7" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 30.</note>."</q> Many of theſe excellent eſſays were written as haſtily as an ordinary letter. Mr. Langton remembers Johnſon, when on a viſit at Oxford, aſking him one evening how long it was till the poſt went out; and on being told about half an hour, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"then we ſhall do very well."</q> He upon this inſtantly fat down and finiſhed an Idler, which it was neceſſary ſhould be in London the next day. Mr. Langton having ſignified a wiſh to read it, <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) you ſhall not do more than I have done myſelf."</q> He then folded it up, and ſent it off.</p>
               <p>Yet there are in the Idler ſeveral papers which ſhew as much profundity of thought, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>our of language, as any of this great man's writings. No. 14, <q rend="inline">"Robbery of time;"</q> No. 24, <q rend="inline">"Thinking;"</q> No. 41, <q rend="inline">"Death of a friend;"</q> No. 43, <q rend="inline">"Flight of time;"</q> No. 51, <q rend="inline">"Domeſtick greatneſs unattainable;"</q> No. 52, <q rend="inline">"Self-denial;"</q> No. 58, <q rend="inline">"Actual, how ſhort of fancied excellence;"</q> No. 89, <q rend="inline">"Phyſical evil moral good;"</q> and his concluding paper on <q rend="inline">"The horrour of the laſt,"</q> will prove this aſſertion. I know not why a motto, the uſual trapping of periodical papers, is prefixed to very few of the Idlers, as I have heard Johnſon commend the cuſtom; and he never could be at a loſs for one, his memory being ſtored with innumerable paſſages of the claſſicks. In this ſeries of eſſays he exhibits admirable inſtances of grave humour, of which he had
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0548300101:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 an uncommon ſhare. Nor on ſome occaſions has he repreſſed that power of ſophiſtry which he poſſeſſed in ſo eminent a degree. In No. 11, he treats with the utmoſt contempt the opinion that our mental f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>culties depend, in ſome degree, upon the weather; an opinion, which they who have never experienced its truth are not to be envied, and of which he himſelf could not but be ſenſible, as the effects of weather upon him were very viſible. Yet thus he declaims: <q rend="inline">"Surely, nothing is more reproachful to a being endowed with reaſon, than to reſign its powers to the influence of the air, and live in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the weather and the wind for the only bleſſings which Nature has put into our power, tranquillity and benevolence.—This diſtinction of ſeaſons is produced only by imagination operating on luxury. To temperance, every day is bright; and every hour is propitious to diligence. He that ſhall reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely excite his faculties, or exert his virtues, will ſoon make himſelf ſuperiour to the ſeaſons; and may ſet at defiance the morning miſt and the evening damp, the blaſts of the eaſt, and the clouds of the ſouth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Alas! it is too certain, that where the frame has delicate fibres, and there is a fine ſenſibility, ſuch influences of the air are irreſiſtible. He might as well have bid defiance to the ague, the palſy, and all other bodily diſorders. Such boaſting of the force of mind is falſe elevation.
<q>
                     <l>"I think the Romans call it Stoiciſm."</l>
                  </q>
But in this number of his Idler his ſpirits ſeem to run riot; for in the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his diſquiſition he forgets, for a moment, even the reverence for that which he held in high reſpect; and deſcribes <q rend="inline">"the attendant on a <hi>Court,"</hi>
                  </q> as one <q rend="inline">"whoſe buſineſs is to watch the looks of a being, weak and fooliſh as himſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His unqualified ridicule of rhetorical geſture or action is not, ſurely, a teſt of truth; yet we cannot help admiring how well it is adapted to produce the effect which he wiſhed. <q rend="inline">"Neither the judges of our laws, nor the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of our people, would be much affected by laboured geſticulation, or believe any man the more becauſe he rolled his eyes, or puffed his cheeks, or ſpread abroad his arms, or ſtamped the ground, or thumped his breaſt, or turned his eyes ſometimes to the cieling, and ſometimes to the floor."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A caſual coincidence with other writers, or an adoption of a ſentiment or image which has been found in the writings of another, and afterwards appears in the mind as one's own, is not unfrequent. The richneſs of Johnſon's fancy, which could ſupply his page abundantly on all occaſions, and the ſtrength of his memory, which at once detected the real owner of any thought, made him leſs liable to the imputation of plagiariſm than, perhaps, any of our
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0548300101:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
writers. In the Idler, however, there is a paper, in which converſation is aſſimilated to a bowl of punch, where there is the ſame train of compariſon as in a poem by Blacklock, in his collection publiſhed in 1756; in which a parallel is ingeniouſly drawn between human life and that liquor.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1759"/> In 1759, in the month of January, his mother died, at the great age of ninety, an event which deeply affected him, not that <q rend="inline">"his mind had acquired no firmneſs by the contemplation of mortality <note n="3" place="bottom">Hawkins's Life of Johnſon, p. 365.</note>,"</q> but that his reverential affection for her was not abated by years, as indeed he retained all his tender feelings even to the lateſt period of his life. I have been told that he regretted much his not having gone to viſit his mother for ſeveral years previous to her death. But he was conſtantly engaged in literary labours, which confined him to London; and though he had not the comfort of ſeeing his aged parent, he contributed liberally to her ſupport.</p>
               <p>Soon after this event, he wrote his <q rend="inline">"RASSELAS, PRINCE OF ABYSSINIA; *"</q> concerning the publication of which Sir John Hawkins gueſſes vaguely and idly, inſtead of having taken the trouble to inform himſelf with authentick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Not to trouble my readers with a repetition of the Knight's reveries, I have to mention, that the late Mr. Strahan the printer told me, that Johnſon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0548300101:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wrote it, that with the profits he might defray the expence of his mother's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1759. Aetat. 50."/> funeral, and pay ſome little debts which ſhe had left. He told Sir Joſhua Reynolds that he compoſed it in the evenings of one week, ſent it to the preſs in portions as it was written, and had never ſince read it over. Mr. Strahan, Mr. Johnſton, and Mr. Dodſley purchaſed it for a hundred pounds, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paid him twenty-five pounds more when it came to a ſecond edition.</p>
               <p>Conſidering the large ſums which have been received for compilations, and works requiring not much more genius than compilations, we cannot but wonder at the very low price which he was content to receive for this admirable performance, which, though he had written nothing elſe, would have rendered his name immortal in the world of literature. None of his writings has been ſo extenſively diffuſed over Europe; for it has been tranſlated into moſt, if not all, of the modern languages. This Tale, with all the charms of oriental imagery, and all the force and beauty of which the Engliſh language is capable, leads us through the moſt important ſcenes of human life, and ſhews us that this ſtage of our being is full of <q rend="inline">"vanity and vexation of ſpirit."</q> To thoſe who look no further than the preſent life, or who maintain that human nature has not fallen from the ſtate in which it was created, the inſtruction of this ſublime ſtory will be of no avail. But they who think juſtly, and feel with ſtrong ſenſibility, will liſten with eagerneſs and admiration to its truth and wiſdom. Voltaire's CANDIDE, written to refute the ſyſtem of Optimiſm, which it has accompliſhed with brilliant ſucceſs, is wonderfully ſimilar in its plan and conduct to Johnſon's RASSELAS; inſomuch, that I have heard Johnſon ſay, that if they had not been publiſhed ſo cloſely one after the other that there was not time for imitation, it would have been in vain to deny that the ſcheme of that which came lateſt was taken from the other. Though the propoſition illuſtrated by both theſe works was the ſame, namely, that in our preſent ſtate there is more evil than good, the intention of the writers was very different. Voltaire, I am afraid, meant only by wanton profaneneſs to obtain a ſportive victory over religion, and to diſcredit the belief of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending Providence: Johnſon meant, by ſhewing the unſatisfactory nature of things temporal, to direct the hopes of man to things eternal. Raſſelas, as was obſerved to me by a very accompliſhed lady, may be conſidered as a more enlarged and more deeply philoſophical diſcourſe in proſe, upon the intereſting truth, which in his <q rend="inline">"Vanity of human Wiſhes"</q> he had ſo ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enforced in verſe.</p>
               <p>The fund of thinking which this work contains is ſuch, that almoſt every ſentence of it may furniſh a ſubject of long meditation. I am not ſatisfied if a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0548300101:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 year paſſes without my having read it through; and at every peruſal, my admiration of the mind which produced it is ſo highly raiſed, that I can ſcarcely believe that I had the honour of enjoying the intimacy of ſuch a man.</p>
               <p>I reſtrain myſelf from quoting paſſages from this excellent work, or even referring to them, becauſe I ſhould not know what to ſelect, or, rather, what to omit. I ſhall, however, tranſcribe one, as it ſhews how well he could ſtate the arguments of thoſe who believe in the appearance of departed ſpirits, a doctrine which it is a miſtake to ſuppoſe that he himſelf ever poſitively held.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If all your fear be of apparitions, (ſaid the Prince,) I will promiſe you ſafety: there is no danger from the dead; he that is once buried will be ſeen no more.</p>
                  <p>That the dead are ſeen no more (ſaid Imlac,) I will not undertake to maintain againſt the concurrent and unvaried teſtimony of all ages, and of all nations. There is no people, rude or learned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not related and believed. This opinion, which prevails as far as human nature is diffuſed, could become univerſal only by its truth; thoſe that never heard of one another, would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible. That it is doubted by ſingle cavillers, can very little weaken the general evidence; and ſome who deny it with their tongues, confeſs it by their fears.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the high admiration of Raſſelas, I will not maintain that the <q rend="inline">"morbid melancholy"</q> in Johnſon's conſtitution may not, perhaps, have made life appear to him more inſipid and unhappy than it generally is; for I am ſure that he had leſs enjoyment from it than I have. Yet, whatever additional ſhade his own particular ſenſations may have thrown on his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of life, attentive obſervation and cloſe inquiry have convinced me, that there is too much of reality in the gloomy picture. The truth, however, is, that we judge of the happineſs and miſery of life differently at different times, according to the ſtate of our changeable frame. I always remember a remark made to me by a Turkiſh lady, educated in France, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Ma foi, Monſieur, notre bonheur depend du façon que notre ſang circule."</hi>
                  </q> This have I learnt from a pretty hard courſe of experience, and would, from ſincere benevolence, impreſs upon all who honour this book with a peruſal, that until a ſteady conviction is obtained, that the preſent life is an imperfect ſtate, and only a paſſage to a better, if we comply with the divine ſcheme of progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive improvement; and alſo that it is a part of the myſterious plan of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that intellectual beings muſt <q rend="inline">"be made perfect through ſuffering;"</q> there will be a continual recurrence of diſappointment and uneaſineſs. But
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0548300101:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if we walk with hope in <q rend="inline">"the mid-day ſun"</q> of revelation, our temper and diſpoſition will be ſuch, that the comforts and enjoyments in our way will be reliſhed, while we patiently ſupport the inconveniencies and pains. After much ſpeculation and various reaſonings, I acknowledge myſelf convinced of the truth of Voltaire's concluſion, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Apres tout c'eſt un monde paſſable."</hi>
                  </q> But we muſt not think too deeply:

                     <p>This paper was in ſuch high eſtimation before it was collected into volumes, that it was ſeized on with avidity by various publiſhers of newſpapers and magazines, to enrich their publications. Johnſon, to put a ſtop to this unfair proceeding, wrote for the Univerſal Chronicle the following advertiſement, in which there is, perhaps, more pomp of words than the occaſion demanded:</p>

                        <q rend="inline">"London, January 5, 1759. Advertiſement. The proprietors of the paper entitled 'The Idler,' having found that thoſe eſſays are inſerted in the newſpapers and magazines with ſo little regard to juſtice or decency, that the Univerſal Chronicle, in which they firſt appear, is not always mentioned, think it neceſſary to declare to the publiſhers of thoſe collections, that however patiently they have hitherto endured theſe injuries, made yet more injurious by contempt, they have now determined to endure them no longer. They have already ſeen eſſays, for which a very large price is paid, transferred, with the moſt ſhameleſs rapacity, into the weekly or monthly compila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their right, at leaſt for the preſent, alienated from them, before they could themſelves be ſaid to enjoy it. But they would not willingly be thought to want tenderneſs, even for men by whom no tenderneſs hath been ſhewn. The paſt is without remedy, and ſhall be without reſentment. But thoſe who have been thus buſy with their ſickles in the fields of their neighbours, are henceforward to take notice, that the time of impunity is at an end. Whoever ſhall, without our leave, lay the hand of rapine upon our papers, is to expect that we ſhall vindicate our due, by the means which juſtice preſcribes, and which are warranted by the immemorial preſcriptions of honourable trade. We ſhall lay hold, in our turn, on their copies, degrade them from thepomp of wide margin and diffuſe typography, contract them into a narrow ſpace, and ſell them at an humble price; yet not with a view of growing rich by confiſcations, for we think not much better of money got by puniſhment than by crimes. We ſhall, therefore, when our loſſes are repaid, give what profit ſhall remain to the <hi>Magdalens;</hi> for we know not who can be more properly taxed for the ſupport of penitent proſtitutes, than proſtitutes in whom there yet appears neither penitence nor ſhame."</q>

                     <p>YOUR father's inexorability not only grieves but amazes me: he is your father: he was always accounted a wiſe man; nor do I remember any thing to the diſadvantage of his good nature; but in his refuſal to aſſiſt you there is neither good-nature, fatherhood, nor wiſdom. It is the practice of good-nature to overlook faults which have already, by the conſequences, puniſhed the delinquent. It is natural for a father to think more favourably than others of his children; and it is always wife to give aſſiſtance while a little help will prevent the neceſſity of greater.</p>
                     <p>If you married imprudently, you miſcarried at your own hazard, at an age when you had a right of choice. It would be hard if the man might not chooſe his own wife, who has a right to plead before the Judges of his country.</p>
                     <p>If your imprudence has ended in difficulties and inconveniences, you are yourſelf to ſupport them; and, with the help of a little better health, you would ſupport them and conquer them. Surely, that want which accident and ſickneſs produces, is to be ſupported in every region of humanity, though there were neither friends nor fathers in the world. You have certainly from your father the higheſt claim of charity, though none of right; and therefore

I would counſel you to omit no decent nor manly degree of importunity. Your debts in the whole are not large, and of the whole but a ſmall part is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Small debts are like ſmall ſhot; they are rattling on every ſide, and can ſcarcely be eſcaped without a wound: great debts are like cannon; of loud noiſe, but little danger. You muſt, therefore, be enabled to diſcharge petty debts, that you may have leiſure, with ſecurity, to ſtruggle with the reſt. Neither the great nor little debts diſgrace you. I am ſure you have my eſteem for the courage with which you contracted them, and the ſpirit with which you endure them. I wiſh my eſteem could be of more uſe. I have been invited, or have invited myſelf, to ſeveral parts of the kingdom; and will not incommode my dear Lucy by coming to Lichfield, while her preſent lodging is of any uſe to her. I hope in a few days to be at leiſure, and to make viſits. Whither I ſhall fly is matter of no importance. A man uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected is at home every where; unleſs he may be ſaid to be at home no where. I am ſorry, dear Sir, that where you have parents, a man of your merits ſhould not have an home. I wiſh I could give it you. I am, my dear Sir,</p>

He was humble enough to deſire my aſſiſtance on this occaſion, though he and I were never cater-couſins; and I gave him to underſtand that I would make application to my friend Mr. Wilkes, who, perhaps, by his intereſt with Dr. Hay and Mr. Elliott, might be able to procure the diſcharge of his lacquey.

               <p>Mr. Wilkes, who upon all occaſions has acted, as a private gentleman, with moſt polite liberality, applied to his friend Sir George Hay, then one of the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty; and Francis Barber was diſcharged, as he has told me, without any wiſh of his own. He recollects the preciſe time to be three days before King George II. died. He found his old maſter in chambers in the Inner Temple, and returned to his ſervice.</p>
               <p>What particular new ſcheme of life Johnſon had in view this year, I have not diſcovered; but that he meditated one of ſome ſort, is clear from his private devotions, in which we find <note n="2" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 30 and 40.</note>, <q rend="inline">"the change of outward things which I am now to make;"</q> and, <q rend="inline">"Grant me the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that the courſe which I am now beginning may proceed according to thy laws, and end in the enjoyment of thy favour."</q> But he did not, in fact, make any external or viſible change.</p>

At this time there being a competition among the architects of London to be employed in the building of Blackfriars-bridge, a queſtion was very warmly agitated whether ſemicircular or elliptical arches were preferable. In the deſign offered by Mr. Mylne the elliptical form was adopted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the great object of his rivals to attack it. Johnſon's regard for his friend Mr. Gwyn induced him to engage in this controverſy againſt Mr. Mylne <note n="3" place="bottom">
                     <p>Sir John Hawkins has given a long detail of it, in that manner vulgarly, but ſignificantly, called <hi>rigmarole;</hi> in which, amidſt an oſtentatious exhibition of arts and artiſts, he talks of <q rend="inline">"pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of a column being taken from that of the human figure, and <hi>adjuſted by Nature</hi>—maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and feminine—in a man, <hi>ſeſquioctave</hi> of the head, and in a woman <hi>ſeſquinonal;"</hi>
                        </q> nor has he failed to introduce a jargon of muſical terms, which do not ſeem much to correſpond with the ſubject, but ſerve to make up the heterogeneous maſs. To follow the Knight through all this, would be an uſeleſs fatigue to myſelf, and not a little diſguſting to my readers. I ſhall, therefore, only make a few remarks upon his ſtatement.—He ſeems to exult in having detected Johnſon in procuring <q rend="inline">"from a perſon eminently ſkilled in mathematicks and the principles of architecture, anſwers to a ſtring of queſtions drawn up by himſelf, touching the comparative ſtrength of ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular and elliptical arches."</q> Now I cannot conceive how Johnſon could have acted more wiſely. Sir John complains that the opinion of that excellent mathematician, Mr. Thomas Simpſon, did not preponderate in favour of the ſemicircular arch. But he ſhould have known, that however eminent Mr. Simpſon was in the higher parts of abſtract mathematical ſcience, he was little verſed in mixed and practical mechanicks. Mr. Muller, of Woolwich Academy, the ſcholaſtick father of all the great engineers which this country has employed for forty years, decided the queſtion by declaring clearly in favour of the elliptical arch.</p>
                     <p>It is ungraciouſly ſuggeſted, that Johnſon's motive for oppoſing Mr. Mylne's ſcheme may have been his prejudice againſt him as a native of North-Britain; when, in truth, as has been ſtated, he gave the aid of his able pen to a friend, who was one of the candidates; and ſo far was he from having any illiberal antipathy to Mr. Mylne, that he afterwards lived with that gentleman upon very agreeable terms of acquaintance, and dined with him at his houſe. Sir John Hawkins, indeed, gives full vent to his own prejudice in abuſing Blackfriars-bridge, calling it <q rend="inline">"an edifice, in which beauty and ſymmetry are in vain ſought for; by which the citizens of London have perpetuated their own diſgrace, and ſubjected a whole nation to the reproach of foreigners."</q> Whoever has contemplated, <hi>placido lumine,</hi> this ſtately, elegant, and airy ſtructure, which has ſo fine an effect, eſpecially on approaching the capital on that quarter, muſt wonder at ſuch unjuſt and ill-tempered cenſure; and I appeal to all foreigners of good taſte, whether this bridge be not one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed ornaments of London. As to the ſtability of the fabrick, it is certain that the City of London took every precaution to have the beſt Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſtone for it; but as this is to be found in the quarries belonging to the publick, under the direction of the Lords of the Treaſury, it ſo happened that parliamentary intereſt, which is often the bane of fair purſuits, thwarted their endeavours. Notwithſtanding this diſadvantage, it is well known that not only has Blackfriars-bridge never ſunk either in its foundations or in its arches, which were ſo much the ſubject of conteſt, but any injuries which it has ſuffered from the effects of ſevere froſts have been already, in ſome meaſure, repaired with ſounder ſtone, and every neceſſary renewal can be completed at a moderate expence.</p>
                  </note>; and after being at conſiderable pains to ſtudy the ſubject, he wrote three ſeveral letters in the Gazetteer, in oppoſition to his plan.</p>

 If it ſhould be remarked that this was a controverſy which lay quite out of Johnſon's way, let it be remembered that after all, his employing his powers of reaſoning and eloquence upon a ſubject which he had ſtudied on the moment, is not more ſtrange than what we often obſerve in lawyers, who, as <hi>Quicquid agunt homines</hi> is the matter of law-ſuits, are ſometimes obliged to pick up a temporary knowledge of an art or ſcience, of which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing till their brief was delivered, and appear to be much maſters of it. In like manner, members of the legiſlature frequently introduce and expatiate upon ſubjects of which they have informed themſelves for the occaſion.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1760"/> In 1760 he wrote <q rend="inline">"An Addreſs of the Painters to George III. on his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, †"</q> which no monarch ever aſcended with more ſincere congratulations from his people.

               <p>Johnſon was now either very idle, or very buſy with his Shakſpeare; for I can find no other publick compoſition by him except an account which he gave in the Gentleman's Magazine of Mr. Tytler's acute and able vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mary Queen of Scots. * The generoſity of Johnſon's feelings ſhines forth in the following ſentence: <q rend="inline">"It has now been faſhionable, for near half a century, to defame and vilify the houſe of Stuart, and to exalt and magnify the reign of Elizabeth. The Stuarts have found few apologiſts; for the dead cannot pay for praiſe, and who will, without reward, oppoſe the tide of popularity? Yet there remains ſtill among us, not wholly extinguiſhed, a zeal for truth, a deſire of eſtabliſhing right in oppoſition to faſhion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this year I have not diſcovered a ſingle private letter written by him to any of his friends. It ſhould ſeem, however, that he had at this period a floating intention of writing a hiſtory of the recent and wonderful ſucceſſes of the Britiſh arms in all quarters of the globe; for among his reſolutions or memorandums, September 18, there is, <q rend="inline">"Send for books for Hiſt. of War <note n="4" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 42.</note>."</q> How much is it to be regretted that this intention was not fulfilled. His majeſtick expreſſion would have carried down to the lateſt poſterity the glorious

               <p>I take this opportunity to relate the manner in which an acquaintance firſt commenced between Dr. Johnſon and Mr. Murphy. During the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <q rend="inline">"The Gray's-Inn Journal,"</q> a periodical paper which was ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carried on by Mr. Murphy alone, when a very young man, he happened to be in the country with Mr. Foote; and having mentioned that he was obliged to go to London in order to get ready for the preſs one of the numbers of that Journal, Foote ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"You need not go on that account. Here is a French magazine, in which you will find a very pretty oriental tale; tranſlate that, and ſend it to your printer."</q> Mr. Murphy having read the tale, was highly pleaſed with it, and followed Foote's advice. When he returned to town, this tale was pointed out to him in the Rambler, from whence it had been tranſlated into the French magazine. Mr. Murphy then waited upon Johnſon, to explain this curious incident. His talents, literature, and gentleman-like manners, were ſoon perceived by Johnſon, and a friendſhip was formed which was never broken.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, who was ever awake to the calls of humanity, wrote this year an Introduction* to the proceedings of the Committee for cloathing the French priſoners.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1761"/> In 1761 Johnſon appears to have done little. He was ſtill, no doubt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his edition of Shakſpeare; but what advances he made in it cannot be aſcertained. He certainly was at this time not active; for in his ſcrupulous examination of himſelf on Eaſter eve, he laments, in his too rigorous mode of cenſuring his own conduct, that his life, ſince the communion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Eaſter, had been <q rend="inline">"diſſipated and uſeleſs <note n="5" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 44.</note>."</q> He, however, contributed this year the Preface* to <q rend="inline">"Rolt's Dictionary of Trade and Commerce,"</q> in which he diſplays ſuch a clear and comprehenſive knowledge of the ſubject, as might lead the reader to think that its authour had devoted all his life to it. I aſked him, whether he knew much of Rolt, and of his work. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) I never ſaw the man, and never read the book. The bookſellers wanted a Preface to a Dictionary of Trade and Commerce. I knew very well what ſuch a Dictionary ſhould be, and I wrote a Preface accordingly."</q> Rolt, who wrote a great deal for the bookſellers, particularly a Hiſtory of the War, on which, as we have ſeen, Johnſon himſelf once had thoughts of employing his pen, was, as Johnſon told me, a ſingular character. Though not in the leaſt acquainted with him, he uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I am juſt come from Sam. Johnſon."</q> This was a ſufficient ſpecimen of his vanity and impudence. But he gave a more
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0548300101:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eminent proof of it in our ſiſter kingdom,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Dr. Johnſon informed me. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1761. Aetat. 52."/> Akenſide's <q rend="inline">"Pleaſures of the Imagination"</q> firſt came out, he did not put his name to the poem. Rolt went over to Dublin, publiſhed an edition of it, and put his own name to it. Upon the fame of this he lived for ſeveral months, being entertained at the beſt tables as <q rend="inline">"the ingenious Mr. Rolt."</q> His converſation, indeed, did not diſcover much of the fire of a poet; but it was recollected, that both Addiſon and Thomſon were equally dull till excited by wine. Akenſide having been informed of this impoſition, vindicated his right by publiſhing the poem with its real authour's name. Several inſtances of ſuch literary fraud have been detected. The Reverend Dr. Campbell, of St. Andrew's, wrote a book on the authenticity of the Goſpel Hiſtory, the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of which he ſent to Mr. Innys, a clergyman in England, who was his countryman and acquaintance. Innys publiſhed it with his own name to it; and before the impoſition was diſcovered, obtained conſiderable promotion, as a reward of his merit. The celebrated Dr. Hugh Blair, and his couſin Mr. George Ballantine, when ſtudents in divinity, wrote a poem, entitled <q rend="inline">"Redemption,"</q> copies of which were handed about in manuſcript. They were, at length, very much ſurprized to ſee a pompous edition of it in folio, dedicated to the Queen, by a Dr. Douglas, as his own. Some years ago a little novel, entitled <q rend="inline">"The Man of Feeling,"</q> was aſſumed by Mr. Eccles, a young Iriſh clergyman, who was afterwards drowned near Bath. He had been at the pains to tranſcribe the whole book, with blottings, interlineations, and corrections, that it might be ſhewn to ſeveral people as an original. It was, in truth, the production of Mr. Henry Mackenzie, an attorney in the Exchequer at Edinburgh, who is the authour of ſeveral other ingenious pieces; but the belief with regard to Mr. Eccles became ſo general, that it was thought neceſſary for Meſſieurs Strahan and Cadell to publiſh an advertiſement in the newſpapers, contradicting the report, and mentioning that they purchaſed the copy right of Mr. Mackenzie. I can conceive this kind of fraud to be very eaſily practiſed with ſucceſsful effrontery. The <hi>filiation</hi> of a literary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is difficult of proof; ſeldom is there any witneſs preſent at its birth. A man, either in confidence or by improper means, obtains poſſeſſion of a copy of it in manuſcript, and boldly publiſhes it as his own. The true authour, in many caſes, may not be able to make his title clear. Johnſon, indeed, from the peculiar features of his literary offspring, might bid defiance to any attempt to appropriate them to others:

               <p>Johnſon had now for ſome years admitted Mr. Baretti to his intimacy; nor did their friendſhip ceaſe upon their being ſeparated by Baretti's reviſiting his native country, as appears from Johnſon's letters to him.</p>

                     <head>To Mr. <hi>JOSEPH BARETTI,</hi> at Milan.</head>
                     <p>YOU reproach me very often with parſimony of writing: but you may diſcover by the extent of my paper, that I deſign to recompence rarity by length. A ſhort letter to a diſtant friend is, in my opinion, an inſult like that of a ſlight bow or curſory ſalutation;—a proof of unwillingneſs to do much, even where there is a neceſſity of doing ſomething. Yet it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that he who continues the ſame courſe of life in the ſame place, will have little to tell. One week and one year are very like another. The ſilent changes made by time are not always perceived; and if they are not perceived, cannot be recounted. I have riſen and laid down, talked and muſed, while you have roved over a conſiderable part of Europe: yet I have not envied my Baretti any of his pleaſures, though, perhaps, I have envied others his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and I am glad to have other nations made acquainted with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Engliſh, by a traveller who has ſo nicely inſpected our manners, and ſo ſucceſsfully ſtudied our literature. I received your kind letter from Falmouth, in which you gave me notice of your departure for Liſbon; and another from Liſbon, in which you told me, that you were to leave Portugal in a few days. To either of theſe how could any anſwer be returned? I have had a third from Turin, complaining that I have not anſwered the former. Your Engliſh ſtyle ſtill continues in its purity and vigour. With vigour your genius will ſupply it; but its purity muſt be continued by cloſe attention. To uſe two languages familiarly, and without contaminating one by the other, is very difficult; and to uſe more than two, is hardly to be hoped. The praiſes which ſome have received for their multiplicity of languages, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to excite induſtry, but can hardly generate confidence.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether I can heartily rejoice at the kind reception which you have found, or at the popularity to which you are exalted. I am willing that your merit ſhould be diſtinguiſhed; but cannot wiſh that your affections may be gained. I would have you happy wherever you are: yet I would have you wiſh to return to England. If ever you viſit us again, you will find the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your friends undiminiſhed. To tell you how many enquiries are made
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0548300101:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after you, would be tedious, or if not tedious, would be vain; becauſe you may be told in a very few words, that all who knew you wiſh you well; and all that you embraced at your departure, will careſs you at your return: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not let Italian academicians nor Italian ladies drive us from your thoughts. You may find among us what you will leave behind, ſoft ſmiles and eaſy ſonnets. Yet I ſhall not wonder if all our invitations ſhould be rejected: for there is a pleaſure in being conſiderable at home, which is not eaſily reſiſted.</p>
                     <p>By conducting Mr. Southwell to Venice, you fulfilled, I know, the original contract: yet I would wiſh you not wholly to loſe him from your notice, but to recommend him to ſuch acquaintance as may beſt ſecure him from ſuffering by his own follies, and to take ſuch general care both of his ſafety and his intereſt as may come within your power. His relations will thank you for any ſuch gratuitous attention: at leaſt they will not blame you for any evil that may happen, whether they thank you or not for any good.</p>
                     <p>You know that we have a new King and a new Parliament. Of the new Parliament Fitzherbert is a member. We were ſo weary of our old King, that we are much pleaſed with his ſucceſſor; of whom we are ſo much inclined to hope great things, that moſt of us begin already to believe them. The young man is hitherto blameleſs; but it would be unreaſonable to expect much from the immaturity of juvenile years, and the ignorance of princely education. He has been long in the hands of the Scots, and has already favoured them more than the Engliſh will contentedly endure. But, perhaps, he ſcarcely knows whom he has diſtinguiſhed, or whom he has diſguſted.</p>
                     <p>The Artiſts have inſtituted a yearly exhibition of pictures and ſtatues, in imitation, as I am told, of foreign Academies. This year was the ſecond exhibition. They pleaſe themſelves much with the multitude of ſpectators, and imagine that the Engliſh ſchool will riſe in reputation. Reynolds is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rival, and continues to add thouſands to thouſands, which he deſerves, among other excellencies, by retaining his kindneſs for Baretti. This exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition has filled the heads of the Artiſts and lovers of art. Surely life, if it be not long, is tedious, ſince we are forced to call in the aſſiſtance of ſo many trifles to rid us of our time, of that time which never can return.</p>
                     <p>I know my Baretti will not be ſatisfied with a letter in which I give him no account of myſelf: yet what account ſhall I give him? I have not, ſince the day of our ſeparation, ſuffered or done any thing conſiderable. The only change in my way of life is, that I have frequented the theatre more than in former ſeaſons. But I have gone thither only to eſcape from myſelf. We have had many new farces, and the comedy called 'The Jealous Wife,' which, though not written with much genius, was yet ſo well adapted to the ſtage,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0548300101:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 and ſo well exhibited by the actors, that it was crowded for near twenty nights. I am digreſſing from myſelf to the playhouſe; but a barren plan muſt be filled with epiſodes. Of myſelf I have nothing to say, but that I have hitherto lived without the concurrence of my own judgement; yet I continue to flatter myſelf, that, when you return, you will find me mended. I do not wonder that, where the monaſtick life is permitted, every order finds votaries, and every monaſtery inhabitants. Men will ſubmit to any rule, by which they may be exempted from the tyranny of caprice and of chance. They are glad to ſupply by external authority their own want of conſtancy and reſolution, and court the government of others, when long experience has convinced them of their own inability to govern themſelves. If I were to viſit Italy, my curioſity would be more attracted by convents than by palaces; though I am afraid that I ſhould find expectation in both places equally diſappointed, and life in both places ſupported with impatience and quitted with reluctance. That it muſt be ſo ſoon quitted, is a powerful remedy againſt impatience; but what ſhall free us from reluctance? Thoſe who have endeavoured to teach us to die well, have taught few to die willingly; yet I cannot but hope that a good life might end at laſt in a contented death.</p>
                     <p>You ſee to what a train of thought I am drawn by the mention of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Let me now turn my attention upon you. I hope you take care to keep an exact journal, and to regiſter all occurrences and obſervations; for your friends here expect ſuch a book of travels as has not been often ſeen. You have given us good ſpecimens in your letters from Liſbon. I wiſh you had ſtaid longer in Spain, for no country is leſs known to the reſt of Europe; but the quickneſs of your diſcernment muſt make amends for the celerity of your motions. He that knows which way to direct his view, ſees much in a little time.</p>
                     <p>Write to me very often, and I will not neglect to write to you; and I may, perhaps, in time get ſomething to write: at leaſt, you will know by my letters, whatever elſe they may have or want, that I continue to be</p>

               <p>The following letter, which, on account of its intrinſick merit, it would have been unjuſt both to Johnſon and the publick to have with-held, was obtained for me by the ſolicitation of my friend Mr. Seward:

                        <head>To Dr. <hi>STAUNTON,</hi> (now Sir <hi>GEORGE STAUNTON,</hi> Bart.)</head>

                        <p>I MAKE haſte to anſwer your kind letter, in hope of hearing again from you before you leave us. I cannot but regret that a man of your quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications ſhould find it neceſſary to ſeek an eſtabliſhment in Gaudaloupe, which if a peace ſhould reſtore to the French, I ſhall think it ſome alleviation of the loſs, that it muſt reſtore likewiſe Dr. Staunton to the Engliſh.</p>
                        <p>It is a melancholy conſideration, that ſo much of our time is neceſſarily to be ſpent upon the care of living, and that we can ſeldom obtain eaſe in one reſpect but by reſigning it in another; yet I ſuppoſe we are by this diſpenſation not leſs happy in the whole, than if the ſpontaneous bounty of Nature poured all that we want into our hands. A few, if they were thus left to themſelves, would, perhaps, ſpend their time in laudable purſuits; but the greater part would prey upon the quiet of each other, or, in the want of other objects, would prey upon themſelves.</p>
                        <p>This, however, is our condition, which we muſt improve and ſolace as we can: and though we cannot chooſe always our place of reſidence, we may
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0548300101:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 in every place find rational amuſements, and poſſeſs in every place the comforts of piety and a pure conſcience.</p>
                        <p>In America there is little to be obſerved except natural curioſities. The new world muſt have many vegetables and animals with which philoſophers are but little acquainted. I hope you will furniſh yourſelf with ſome books of natural hiſtory, and ſome glaſſes and other inſtruments of obſervation. Truſt as little as you can to report; examine all you can by your own ſenſes. I do not doubt but you will be able to add much to knowledge, and, perhaps, to medicine. Wild nations truſt to ſimples; and, perhaps, the Peruvian bark is not the only ſpecifick which thoſe extenſive regions may afford us.</p>

If it be aſked, what is the improper expectation which it is dangerous to indulge, experience will quickly anſwer, that it is ſuch expectation as is dictated not by reaſon, but by deſire; expectation raiſed, not by the common occurrences of life, but by the wants of the expectant; an expectation that requires the common courſe of things to be changed, and the general rules of action to be broken.</p>

                     <p>HOWEVER juſtly you may accuſe me for want of punctuality in correſpondence, I am not ſo far loſt in negligence as to omit the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of writing to you, which Mr. Beauclerk's paſſage through Milan affords me.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe you received the Idlers, and I intend that you ſhall ſoon receive Shakſpeare, that you may explain his works to the ladies of Italy, and tell them the ſtory of the editor, among the other ſtrange narratives with which your long reſidence in this unknown region has ſupplied you.</p>
                     <p>As you have now been long away, I ſuppoſe your curioſity may pant for ſome news of your old friends. Miſs Williams and I live much as we did. Miſs Cotterel ſtill continues to cling to Mrs. Porter, and Charlotte is now big of the fourth child. Mr. Reynolds gets ſix thouſands a year. Levet is lately married, not without much ſuſpicion that he has been wretchedly cheated in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0548300101:233"/>
 his match. Mr. Chambers is gone this day, for the firſt time, the circuit with the Judges. Mr. Richardſon is dead of an apoplexy, and his ſecond daughter has married a merchant.</p>
                     <p>My vanity, or my kindneſs, makes me flatter myſelf, that you would rather hear of me than of thoſe whom I have mentioned; but of myſelf I have very little which I care to tell. Laſt winter I went down to my native town, where I found the ſtreets much narrower and ſhorter than I thought I had left them, inhabited by a new race of people, to whom I was very little known. My play-fellows were grown old, and forced me to ſuſpect that I was no longer young. My only remaining friend has changed his principles, and was become the tool of the predominant faction. My daughter-in-law, from whom I expected moſt, and whom I met with ſincere benevolence, has loſt the beauty and gaiety of youth, without having gained much of the wiſdom of age. I wandered about for five days, and took the firſt convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of returning to a place, where, if there is not much happineſs, there is at leaſt ſuch a diverſity of good and evil, that ſlight vexations do not fix upon the heart <note n="6" place="bottom">This is a very juſt account of the relief which London affords to melancholy minds.</note>.</p>
                     <p>I think in a few weeks to try another excurſion; though to what end? Let me know, my Baretti, what has been the reſult of your return to your own country: whether time has made any alteration for the better, and whether, when the firſt raptures of ſalutation were over, you did not find your thoughts confeſſed their diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>Moral ſentences appear oſtentatious and tumid, when they have no greater occaſions than the journey of a wit to his own town: yet ſuch pleaſures and ſuch pains make up the general maſs of life; and as nothing is little to him that feels it with great ſenſibility, a mind able to ſee common incidents in their real ſtate, is diſpoſed by very common incidents to very ſerious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let us truſt that a time will come, when the preſent moment ſhall be no longer irkſome; when we ſhall not borrow all our happineſs from hope, which at laſt is to end in diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>I beg that you will ſhew Mr. Beauclerk all the civilities which you have in your power; for he has always been kind to me.</p>
                     <p>I have lately ſeen Mr. Stratico, Profeſſor of Padua, who has told me of your quarrel with an Abbot of the Celeſtine order; but had not the particulars very ready in his memory. When you write to Mr. Marſili, let him know that I remember him with kindneſs.</p>

                     <p>YOU are not to ſuppoſe, with all your conviction of my idleneſs, that I have paſſed all this time without writing to my Baretti. I gave a letter to Mr. Beauclerk, who, in my opinion, and in his own, was haſtening to Naples for the recovery of his health; but he has ſtopped at Paris, and I know not when he will proceed. Langton is with him.</p>
                     <p>I will not trouble you with ſpeculations about peace and war. The good or ill ſucceſs of battles and embaſſies extends itſelf to a very ſmall part of domeſtick life: we all have good and evil, which we feel more ſenſibly than our petty part of publick miſcarriage or proſperity. I am ſorry for your diſappointment, with which you ſeem more touched than I ſhould expect a man of your reſolution and experience to have been, did I not know that general truths are ſeldom applied to particular occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the fallacy of our ſelf-love extends itſelf as our intereſt or affections. Every man believes that miſtreſſes are unfaithful, and patrons capricious; but he excepts his own miſtreſs and his own patron. We have all learned that greatneſs is negligent and contemptuous, and that in Courts life is often languiſhed away in ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied expectation; but he that approaches greatneſs, or glitters in a Court, imagines that deſtiny has at laſt exempted him from the common lot.</p>
                     <p>Do not let ſuch evils overwhelm you as thouſands have ſuffered, and thouſands have ſurmounted; but turn your thoughts with vigour to ſome other plan of life, and keep always in your mind, that, with due ſubmiſſion to Providence, a man of genius has been ſeldom ruined but by himſelf. Your patron's weakneſs or inſenſibility will finally do you little hurt, if he is not aſſiſted by your own paſſions. Of your love I know not the propriety, nor can eſtimate the power; but in love, as in every other paſſion, of which hope is the eſſence, we ought always to remember the uncertainty of events. There is, indeed, nothing that ſo much ſeduces reaſon from vigilance, as the thought of paſſing life with an amiable woman; and if all would happen that a lover fancies, I know not what other terreſtrial happineſs would deſerve purſuit. But love and marriage are different ſtates. Thoſe who are to ſuffer the evils
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0548300101:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 together, and to ſuffer often for the ſake of one another, ſoon loſe that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of look, and that benevolence of mind, which aroſe from the participation of unmingled pleaſure and ſucceſſive amuſement. A woman, we are ſure, will not be always fair; we are not ſure ſhe will always be virtuous: and man cannot retain through life that reſpect and aſſiduity by which he pleaſes for a day or for a month. I do not, however, pretend to have diſcovered that life has any thing more to be deſired than a prudent and virtuous marriage; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know not what counſel to give you.</p>
                     <p>If you can quit your imagination of love and greatneſs, and leave your hopes of preferment and bridal raptures to try once more the fortune of literature and induſtry, the way through France is now open. We flatter ourſelves that we ſhall cultivate, with great diligence, the arts of peace; and every man will be welcome among us who can teach us any thing we do not know. For your part, you will find all your old friends willing to receive you.</p>
                     <p>Reynolds ſtill continues to increaſe in reputation and in riches. Miſs Williams, who very much loves you, goes on in the old way. Miſs Cotterel is ſtill with Mrs. Porter. Miſs Charlotte is married to Dean Lewis, and has three children. Mr. Levet has married a ſtreet-walker. But the gazette of my narration muſt now arrive to tell you, that Bathurſt went phyſician to the army, and died at the Havannah.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether I have not ſent you word that Huggins and Richardſon are both dead. When we ſee our enemies and friends gliding away before us, let us not forget that we are ſubject to the general law of mortality, and ſhall ſoon be where our doom will be fixed for ever.</p>

               <p>The acceſſion of George the Third to the throne of theſe kingdoms, opened a new and brighter proſpect to men of literary merit, who had been honoured with no mark of royal favour in the preceding reign. His preſent Majeſty's education in this country, as well as his taſte and beneficence, prompted him to be the patron of ſcience and the arts; and early this year Johnſon having been repreſented to him as a very learned and good man, without any certain proviſion, his Majeſty was pleaſed to grant him a penſion
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0548300101:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of three hundred pounds a year. The Earl of Bute was then prime miniſter, and had the honour to announce this inſtance of his ſovereign's bounty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which many and various ſtories, all equally erroneous, have been propagated, maliciouſly repreſenting it as a political bribe to Johnſon to deſert his avowed principles, and become the tool of a government which he held to be founded in uſurpation. I have taken care to have it in my power to refute them from the moſt authentick information. Lord Bute has told me, that Mr. Wedderburn, now Lord Loughborough, was the perſon who firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this ſubject to him. Lord Loughborough has told me, that the penſion was granted to Johnſon ſolely as the reward of his literary merit, without any ſtipulation whatever, or even tacit underſtanding that he ſhould write for adminiſtration. His Lordſhip added, that he was confident the political tracts which Johnſon afterwards did write, as they were entirely conſonant with his own opinions, would have been written by him, though no penſion had been granted to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas Sheridan and Mr. Murphy, who then lived a good deal both with him and Mr. Wedderburn, have told me, that they previouſly talked with Johnſon upon this matter, and that it was perfectly underſtood by all parties that the penſion was merely honorary. Sir Joſhua Reynolds has told me, that Johnſon called on him after his Majeſty's intention had been notified to him, and ſaid he wiſhed to conſult his friends as to the propriety of his accepting this mark of the royal favour, after the definitions which he had given in his Dictionary of <hi>penſion</hi> and <hi>penſioners.</hi> He ſaid he would not have Sir Joſhua's anſwer till next day, when he would call again, and deſired he might think of it. Sir Joſhua anſwered, that he was clear to give his opinion then, that there could be no objection to his receiving from the King a reward for literary merit; and that certainly the definitions in his Dictionary were not applicable to him. Johnſon, it ſhould ſeem, was ſatisfied, for he did not call again till he had accepted the penſion, and had waited on Lord Bute to thank him. He then told Sir Joſhua that Lord Bute ſaid to him expreſsly, <q rend="inline">"It is not given you for any thing you are to do, but for what you have done."</q> His Lordſhip, he ſaid, behaved in the handſomeſt manner. He repeated the words twice, that he might be ſure that Johnſon heard them, and thus ſet his mind perfectly at eaſe. This nobleman, who has been ſo virulently abuſed, acted with great honour in this inſtance, and diſplayed a mind truly liberal. A miniſter of a more narrow and ſelfiſh diſpoſition would have availed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſuch an opportunity to fix an implied obligation on a man of Johnſon's powerful talents to give him his ſupport.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0548300101:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Mr. Murphy and the late Mr. Sheridan ſeverally contended for the diſtinction of having been the firſt who mentioned to Mr. Wedderburn that Johnſon ought to have a penſion. When I ſpoke of this to Lord Loughborough, wiſhing to know if he recollected the prime mover in the buſineſs, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"All his friends aſſiſted:"</q> and when I told him that Mr. Sheridan ſtrenuouſly aſſerted his claim to it, his Lordſhip ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He rang the bell."</q> And it is but juſt to add, that Mr. Sheridan told me, that when he communicated to Dr. Johnſon that a penſion was to be granted him, he replied, in a fervour of gratitude, <q rend="inline">"The Engliſh language does not afford me terms adequate to my feelings on this occaſion. I muſt have recourſe to the French. I am <hi>penetré</hi> with his Majeſty's goodneſs."</q> When I repeated this to Dr. Johnſon, he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it.</p>
               <p>His definitions of <hi>penſion</hi> and <hi>penſioner,</hi> partly founded on the ſatirical verſes of Pope, which he quotes, may be generally true; and yet every body muſt allow, that there may be, and have been, inſtances of penſions given and received upon liberal and honourable terms. Thus, then, it is clear, that there was nothing inconſiſtent or humiliating in Johnſon's accepting of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo unconditionally and ſo honourably offered to him.</p>
               <p>This year his friend Sir Joſhua Reynolds paid a viſit of ſome weeks to his native county, Devonſhire, in which he was accompanied by Johnſon, who was much pleaſed with this jaunt, and declared he had derived from it a great acceſſion of new ideas. He was entertained at the ſeats of ſeveral noblemen and gentlemen in the weſt of England; but the greateſt part of the time was paſſed at Plymouth, where the magnificence of the navy, the ſhip-building and all its circumſtances, afforded him a grand ſubject of contemplation. The Commiſſioner of the Dock-yard paid him the compliment of ordering the yacht to convey him and his friend to the Eddyſtone, to which they accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſailed. But the weather was ſo tempeſtuous that they could not land.</p>
               <p>Reynolds and he were at this time the gueſts of Dr. Mudge, the celebrated ſurgeon, and now phyſician of that place, not more diſtinguiſhed for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of parts and variety of knowledge, than loved and eſteemed for his amiable manners; and here Johnſon formed an acquaintanee with Dr. Mudge's father, that very eminent divine, the Reverend Zachary Mudge, Prebendary of Exeter, who was idoliſed in the weſt, both for his excellence as a preacher and the uniform perfect propriety of his private conduct. He preached a ſermon purpoſely that Johnſon might hear him; and we ſhall ſee afterwards that Johnſon honoured his memory by drawing his character. While Johnſon was at Plymouth, he ſaw a great many of its inhabitants, and was not ſparing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0548300101:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his very entertaining converſation. It was here that he made that frank and truly original confeſſion, that <q rend="inline">"ignorance, pure ignorance,"</q> was the cauſe of a wrong definition in his Dictionary of the word <hi>paſtern</hi> 
                  <note n="7" place="bottom">See p. 163.</note>, to the no ſmall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the Lady who put the queſtion to him; who having the moſt profound reverence for his character, ſo as almoſt to ſuppoſe him endowed with infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, expected to hear an explanation (of what, to be ſure, ſeemed ſtrange to a common reader,) drawn from ſome deep-learned ſource with which ſhe was unacquainted.</p>
               <p>Sir Joſhua Reynolds, to whom I am obliged for my information concerning this excurſion, mentions a very characteriſtical anecdote of Johnſon while at Plymouth. Having obſerved that in conſequence of the Dock-yard a new town had ariſen about two miles off as a rival to the old; and knowing from his ſagacity, and juſt obſervation of human nature, that it is certain if a man hates at all, he will hate his next neighbour; he concluded that this new and riſing town could not but excite the envy and jealouſy of the old, in which conjecture he was very ſoon confirmed; he therefore ſet himſelf reſolutely on the ſide of the old town, the eſtabliſhed town, in which his lot was caſt, conſidering it as a kind of duty to <hi>ſtand by</hi> it. He accordingly entered warmly into its intereſts, and upon every occaſion talked of the <hi>dockers,</hi> as the inhabitants of the new town were called, as upſtarts and aliens. Plymouth is very plentifully ſupplied with water by a river brought into it from a great diſtance, which is ſo abundant that it runs to waſte in the town. The Dock, or New-town, being totally deſtitute of water, petitioned Plymouth that a ſmall portion of the conduit might be permitted to go to them, and this was now under conſideration. Johnſon, affecting to entertain the paſſions of the place, was violent in oppoſition; and half-laughing at himſelf for his pretended zeal, where he had no concern, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"No, no! I am againſt the <hi>dockers;</hi> I am a Plymouth-man. Rogues! let them die of thirſt. They ſhall not have a drop!"</q>

               <p>In 1763 he furniſhed to <q rend="inline">"The Poetical Calendar,"</q> publiſhed by Fawkes and Woty, a character of Collins, * which he afterwards ingrafted into his entire life of that admirable poet, in the collection of lives which he wrote for the body of Engliſh poetry, formed and publiſhed by the bookſellers of London. His account of the melancholy depreſſion with which Collins was ſeverely afflicted, and which brought him to his grave, is, I think, one of the moſt tender and intereſting paſſages in the whole ſeries of his writings. He alſo favoured Mr. Hoole with the Dedication of his tranſlation of Taſſo to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0548300101:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1763. Aetat. 54."/> the Queen, * which is ſo happily conceived and elegantly expreſſed, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but point it out to the peculiar notice of my readers.</p>
               <p>This is to me a memorable year, for in it I had the happineſs to obtain the acquaintance of that extraordinary man whoſe memoirs I am now writing; an acquaintance which I ſhall ever eſteem as one of the moſt fortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in my life. Though then but two-and-twenty, I had for ſeveral years read his works with delight and inſtruction, and had the higheſt reverence for their authour, which had grown up in my fancy into a kind of myſterious veneration, by figuring to myſelf a ſtate of ſolėmn elevated abſtraction, in which I ſuppoſed him to live in the immenſe metropolis of London. Mr. Gentleman, a native of Ireland, who paſſed ſome years in Scotland as a player, and as an inſtructor in the Engliſh language, a man whoſe talents and worth were depreſſed by misfortunes, had given me a repreſentation of his figure and manner; and during my firſt viſit to London, which was for three months in 1760, Mr. Derrick the poet, who was Gentleman's friend and countryman, flattered me with hopes that he would introduce me to Johnſon, an honour of which I was very ambitious. But he never found an opportunity, which made me doubt that he had promiſed to do what was not in his power, till Johnſon ſome years afterwards told me, <q rend="inline">"Derrick, Sir, might very well have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you. I had a kindneſs for Derrick, and am ſorry he is dead."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſummer of 1761 Mr. Thomas Sheridan was at Edinburgh, and delivered lectures upon the Engliſh Language and Publick Speaking to large and reſpectable audiences. I was often in his company, and heard him frequently expatiate upon Johnſon's extraordinary knowledge, talents, and virtues, repeat his pointed ſayings, deſcribe his particularities, and boaſt of his being his gueſt ſometimes till two or three in the morning. At his houſe I hoped to have many opportunities of ſeeing the ſage, as Mr. Sheridan obligingly aſſured me I ſhould not be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>When I returned to London in the end of 1762, to my ſurprize and regret I found an irreconcileable difference had taken place between Johnſon and Sheridan. A penſion of two hundred pounds a year had been given to Sheridan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Johnſon, who as has been already mentioned, thought ſlightingly of Sheridan's art, upon hearing that he was alſo penſioned, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"What! have they given <hi>him</hi> a penſion? Then it is time for me to give up mine."</q> Whether this proceeded from a momentary indignation, as if it were an affront to his exalted merit that a player ſhould be rewarded in the ſame manner with him, or was the ſudden effect of fit of peeviſhneſs, it was unluckily ſaid, and, indeed, cannot be juſtified. Mr. Sheridan's penſion was
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0548300101:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
granted to him not as a player, but as a ſufferer in the cauſe of government,  when he was manager of the Theatre Royal in Ireland, when parties ran high in 1753. And it muſt alſo be allowed that he was a man of literature, and had conſiderably improved the arts of reading and ſpeaking with diſtinctneſs and propriety.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Johnſon ſhould have recollected that Mr. Sheridan taught pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation to Mr. Alexander Wedderburn, whoſe ſiſter was married to Sir Harry Erſkine, an intimate friend of Lord Bute, who was the favourite of the King; and ſurely the moſt outrageous Whig will not maintain, that, whatever ought to be the principle in the diſpoſal of <hi>offices,</hi> a <hi>penſion</hi> ought never to be granted from any bias of court connection. Mr. Macklin, indeed, ſhared with Mr. Sheridan the honour of inſtructing Mr. Wedderburn; and though it was too late in life for a Caledonian to acquire the genuine Engliſh cadence, yet ſo ſucceſsful were Mr. Wedderburn's inſtructors, and his own unabating endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that he got rid of the coarſe part of his Scotch accent, retaining only as much of the <q rend="inline">"native wood-note wild,"</q> as to mark his country; which, if any Scotchman ſhould affect to forget, I ſhould heartily deſpiſe him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the difficulties which are to be encountered by thoſe who have not had the advantange of an Engliſh education, he by degrees formed a mode of ſpeaking, to which Engliſhmen do not deny the praiſe of elegance. Hence his diſtinguiſhed oratory, which he exerted in his own country as an advocate in the Court of Seſſion, and a ruling elder of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> has had its fame and ample reward, in much higher ſpheres. When I look back on this noble perſon at Edinburgh, in ſituations ſo unworthy of his brilliant powers, and behold LORD LOUGHBOROUGH at London, the change ſeems almoſt like one of the metamorphoſes in Ovid; and as his two preceptors, by refining his utterance, gave currency to his talents, we may ſay in the words of that poet, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Nam vos mutaſtis."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this remarkable inſtance of ſucceſsful parts and aſſiduity, becauſe it affords animating encouragement to other gentlemen of North-Britain to try their fortunes in the ſouthern part of the iſland, where they may hope to gratify their utmoſt ambition; and now that we are one people by the Union, it would ſurely be illiberal to maintain that they have not an equal title with the natives of any other part of his Majeſty's dominions.</p>
               <p>Johnſon complained that a man who diſliked him repeated his ſarcaſm to Mr. Sheridan, without telling him what followed, which was, that after a pauſe he added, <q rend="inline">"However, I am glad that Mr. Sheridan has a penſion, for he is a very good man."</q> Sheridan could never forgive this haſty contemptuous
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0548300101:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 expreſſion. It rankled in his mind; and though I informed him of all that Johnſon ſaid, and that he would be very glad to meet him amicably, he poſitively declined repeated offers which I made, and once went off abruptly from a houſe where he and I were engaged to dine, becauſe he was told that Dr. Johnſon was to be there. I have no ſympathetick feeling with ſuch perſevering reſentment. It is painful when there is a breach between thoſe who have lived together ſocially and cordially; and I wonder that there is not, in all ſuch caſes, a mutual wiſh that it ſhould be healed. I could perceive that Mr. Sheridan was by no means ſatisfied with Johnſon's acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him to be a good man. That could not ſooth his injured vanity. I could not but ſmile, at the ſame time that I was offended, to obſerve Sheridan in the Life of Swift <note n="8" place="bottom">P. 447.</note>, which he afterwards publiſhed, attempting, in the writhings of his reſentment, to depreciate Johnſon, by characteriſing him <q rend="inline">"A writer of gigantick fame in theſe days of little men;"</q> that very Johnſon whom he once ſo highly admired and venerated.</p>
               <p>This rupture with Sheridan deprived Johnſon of one of his moſt agreeable reſources for amuſement in his lonely evenings; for Sheridan's well-informed, animated, and buſtling mind never ſuffered converſation to ſtagnate; and Mrs. Sheridan was a moſt agreeable companion to an intellectual man. She was ſenſible, ingenious, unaſſuming, yet communicative. I recollect, with ſatisfaction, many pleaſing hours which I paſſed with her under the hoſpitable roof of her huſband, who was to me a very kind friend. Her novel, entitled <q rend="inline">"Memoirs of Miſs Sydney Biddulph,"</q> contains an excellent moral, while it inculcates a future ſtate of retribution; and what it teaches is impreſſed upon the mind by a ſeries of as deep diſtreſs as can affect humanity. Johnſon paid her this high compliment upon it: <q rend="inline">"I know not, Madam, that you have a right, upon moral principles, to make your readers ſuffer ſo much."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas Davies the actor, who then kept a bookſeller's ſhop in Ruſſel-ſtreet, Covent-garden, told me that Johnſon was very much his friend, and came frequently to his houſe, where he more than once invited me to meet him; but by ſome unlucky accident or other he was prevented from coming to us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas Davies was a man of good underſtanding and talents, with the advantage of a liberal education. Though ſomewhat pompous, he was an entertaining companion; and his literary performances have no inconſiderable ſhare of merit. He was a friendly and very hoſpitable man. Both he and his wife, (who has been celebrated for her beauty,) though upon the ſtage
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0548300101:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for many years, maintained an uniform decency of character; and Johnſon eſteemed them, and lived in as eaſy an intimacy with them as with any family which he uſed to viſit. Mr. Davies recollected ſeveral of Johnſon's remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſayings, and was one of the beſt of the many imitators of his voice and manner, while relating them. He increaſed my impatience more and more to ſee the extraordinary man whoſe works I highly valued, and whoſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was reported to be ſo peculiarly excellent.</p>
               <p>At laſt, on Monday the 16th of May, when I was ſitting in Mr. Davies's back parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnſon unexpectedly came into the ſhop; and Mr. Davies having perceived him through the glaſs door of the room in which we were ſitting, advancing towards us,—he announced his aweful approach to me, ſomewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addreſſes Hamlet on the appearance of his father's ghoſt, <q rend="inline">"Look, my Lord, it comes."</q> I found that I had a very perfect idea of Johnſon's figure, from the portrait of him painted by Sir Joſhua Reynolds ſoon after he had publiſhed his Dictionary, in the attitude of ſitting in his eaſy chair in deep meditation, which was the firſt picture his friend did for him, which Sir Joſhua has very kindly preſented to me, and from which an engraving has been made for this work. Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and reſpectfully introduced me to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting his prejudice againſt the Scotch, of which I had heard much, I ſaid to Davies, <q rend="inline">"Don't tell where I come from."</q>—<q rend="inline">"From Scotland,"</q> cried Davies, roguiſhly. <q rend="inline">"Mr. Johnſon (ſaid I) I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it."</q> I am willing to flatter myſelf that I meant this as light pleaſantry to ſooth and conciliate him, and not as any humiliating abaſement at the expence of my country. But however that might be, this ſpeech was ſomewhat unlucky; for with that quickneſs of wit for which he was ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he ſeized the expreſſion <q rend="inline">"come from Scotland,"</q> which I uſed in the ſenſe of being of that country; and as if I had ſaid that I had come away from it or left it, retorted, <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help."</q> This ſtroke ſtunned me a good deal; and when we had ſat down, I felt myſelf not a little embarraſſed, and apprehenſive of what might come next. He then addreſſed himſelf to Davies: <q rend="inline">"What do you think of Garrick? He has refuſed me an order for the play for Miſs Williams, becauſe he knows the houſe will be full, and that an order would be worth three ſhillings."</q> Eager to take any opening to get into converſation with him, I ventured to ſay, <q rend="inline">"O, Sir, I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge ſuch a trifle to you."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he, with a ſtern look,) I have known
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0548300101:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 David Garrick longer than you have done; and I know no right you have to talk to me on the ſubject."</q> Perhaps I deſerved this check; for it was rather preſumptuous in me, an entire ſtranger, to expreſs any doubt of the juſtice of his animadverſion upon his old acquaintance and pupil <note n="9" place="bottom">That this was a momentary ſally againſt Garrick there can be no doubt; for at Johnſon's deſire he had, ſome years before, given a benefit-night at his theatre to this very perſon, by which ſhe got two hundred pounds. Johnſon, indeed, upon all other occaſions, when I was in his company, praiſed the very liberal charity of Garrick. I once mentioned to him, <q rend="inline">"It is obſerved, Sir, that you attack Garrick yourſelf, but will ſuffer nobody elſe to do it."</q> JOHNSON, (ſmiling) <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that is true."</q>

And, in truth, had not my ardour been uncommonly ſtrong, and my reſolution uncommonly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, ſo rough a reception might have deterred me for ever from making any further attempts. Fortunately, however, I remained upon the field not wholly diſcomfited; and was ſoon rewarded by hearing ſome of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, of which I preſerved the following ſhort minute, without marking the queſtions and obſervations by which it was produced.</p>

                  <p>In barbarous ſociety, ſuperiority of parts is of real conſequence. Great ſtrength or great wiſdom is of much value to an individual. But in more poliſhed times there are people to do every thing for money; and then there are a number of other ſuperiorities, ſuch as thoſe of birth and fortune, and rank, that diſſipate men's attention, and leave no extraordinary ſhare of reſpect for perſonal and intellectual ſuperiority. This is wiſely ordered by Providence, to preſerve ſome equality among mankind.</p>
                  <p>Sir, this book ('The Elements of Criticiſm,' which he had taken up,) is a pretty eſſay, and deſerves to be held in ſome eſtimation, though much of it is chimerical.</p>

                  <p>Derrick may do very well, as long as he can outrun his character; but the moment his character gets up with him it is all over.</p>

               <p>It is, however, but juſt to record, that ſome years afterwards, when I reminded him of this ſarcaſm, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, but Derrick has now got a character that he need not run away from."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was highly pleaſed with the extraordinary vigour of his converſation, and regretted that I was drawn away from it by an engagement at another place. I had, for a part of the evening, been left alone with him, and had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make an obſervation now and then, which he received very civilly; ſo that I was ſatisfied that though there was a roughneſs in his manner, there was no ill-nature in his diſpoſition. Davies followed me to the door, and when I complained to him a little of the hard blows which the great man had given me, he kindly took upon him to conſole me by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Don't be uneaſy. I can ſee he likes you very well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A few days afterwards I called on Davies, and aſked him if he thought I might take the liberty of waiting on Mr. Johnſon at his Chambers in the Temple. He ſaid I certainly might, and that Mr. Johnſon would take it as a compliment. So upon Tueſday the 24th, after having been enlivened by the witty ſallies of Meſſieurs Thornton, Wilkes, Churchill and Lloyd, with whom I had paſſed the morning, I boldly repaired to Johnſon. His Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were on the firſt floor of No. 1, Inner Temple-lane, and I entered them with an impreſſion given me by the Reverend Dr. Blair, of Edinburgh, who had been introduced to him not long before, and deſcribed his having <q rend="inline">"found the giant in his den;"</q> an expreſſion, which, when I came to be pretty well acquainted with Johnſon, I repeated to him, and he was diverted at this pictureſque account of himſelf. Dr. Blair had been preſented to him by Dr. James Fordyce. At this time the controverſy concerning the pieces publiſhed by Mr. James Macpherſon, as tranſlations of Oſſian, was at its height. Johnſon had all along denied their authenticity; and, what was ſtill more provoking to their admirers, maintained that they had no merit. The ſubject having been introduced by Dr. Fordyce, Dr. Blair, relying on the internal evidence of their antiquity, aſked Dr. Johnſon whether he thought any man of a modern age could have written ſuch poems? Johnſon replied, <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, many
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0548300101:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 men, many women, and many children."</q> Johnſon, at this time, did not know that Dr. Blair had juſt publiſhed a Diſſertation, not only defending their authenticity, but ſeriouſly ranking them with the poems of Homer and Virgil; and when he was afterwards informed of this circumſtance, he expreſſed ſome diſpleaſure at Dr. Fordyce's having ſuggeſted the topick, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am not ſorry that they got thus much for their pains. Sir, it was like leading one to talk of a book, when the authour is concealed behind the door."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He received me very courteouſly; but, it muſt be confeſſed, that his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and furniture, and morning dreſs, were ſufficiently uncouth. His brown ſuit of cloaths looked very ruſty; he had on a little old ſhrivelled unpowdered wig, which was too ſmall for his head; his ſhirt-neck and knees of his breeches were looſe; his black worſted ſtockings ill drawn up; and he had a pair of unbuckled ſhoes by way of ſlippers. But all theſe ſlovenly particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities were forgotten the moment that he began to talk. Some gentlemen, whom I do not recollect, were ſitting with him; and when they went away, I alſo roſe; but he ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Nay, don't go."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid I) I am afraid that I intrude upon you. It is benevolent to allow me to ſit and hear you."</q> He ſeemed pleaſed with this compliment, which I ſincerely paid him, and anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I am obliged to any man who viſits me."</q> I have preſerved the following ſhort minute of what paſſed this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Madneſs frequently diſcovers itſelf merely by unneceſſary deviation from the uſual modes of the world. My poor friend Smart ſhewed the diſturbance of his mind by falling upon his knees and ſaying his prayers in the ſtreet, or in any other unuſual place. Now although, rationally ſpeaking, it is greater madneſs not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are ſo many who do not pray, that their underſtanding is not called in queſtion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning this unfortunate poet, Chriſtopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-houſe, he had, at another time, the following converſation with Dr. Burney. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It ſeems as if his mind had ceaſed to ſtruggle with the diſeaſe; for he grows fat upon it."</q> BURNEY. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exerciſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; he has partly as much exerciſe as he uſed to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he uſed for exerciſe to walk to the alehouſe; but he was <hi>carried</hi> back again. I did not think he ought to be ſhut up. His infirmities were not noxious to ſociety. He inſiſted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit. Smart as any one elſe. Another charge was, that he did not love clean linen; and I have no paſſion for it."</q>

So, religious exerciſes, if not performed with an intention to pleaſe GOD, avail us nothing. As our Saviour ſays of thoſe who perform them from other motives, 'Verily they have their reward.'</p>

               </p>
               <p>When I roſe a ſecond time he again preſſed me to ſtay, which I did.</p>
               <p>He told me, that he generally went abroad at four in the afternoon, and ſeldom came home till two in the morning. I took the liberty to aſk if he did not think it wrong to live thus, and not make more uſe of his great talents. He owned it was a bad habit. On reviewing, at the diſtance of many years, my journal of this period, I wonder how, at my firſt viſit, I ventured to talk to him ſo freely, and that he bore it with ſo much indulgence.</p>
               <p>Before we parted he was ſo good as to promiſe to favour me with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany one evening at my lodgings; and, as I took my leave, ſhook me cordially by the hand. It is almoſt needleſs to add, that I felt no little elation at having now ſo happily eſtabliſhed an acquaintance of which I had been ſo long ambitious.</p>
               <p>My readers will, I truſt, excuſe me for being thus minutely circumſtantial, when it is conſidered that the acquaintance of Dr. Johnſon was to me a moſt valuable acquiſition, and laid the foundation of whatever inſtruction and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they may receive from my collections concerning the great ſubject of the work which they are now peruſing.</p>
               <p>I did not viſit him again till Monday, June 13, at which time I recollect no part of his converſation, except that when I told him I had been to ſee Johnſon ride upon three horſes, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Such a man, Sir, ſhould be encouraged; for his performances ſhew the extent of the human powers in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0548300101:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 one inſtance, and thus tend to raiſe our opinion of the faculties of man. He ſhews what may be attained by perſevering application; ſo that every man may hope, that by giving as much application, although perhaps he may never ride three horſes at a time or dance upon a wire, yet he may be equally expert in whatever profeſſion he has choſen to purſue."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He again ſhook me by the hand at parting, and aſked me why I did not come oftener to him. Truſting that I was now in his good graces, I anſwered, that he had not given me much encouragement, and reminded him of the check I had received from him at our firſt interview. <q rend="inline">"Poh, poh! (ſaid he, with a complacent ſmile,) never mind theſe things. Come to me as often as you can. I ſhall be glad to ſee you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I had learnt that his place of frequent reſort was the Mitre tavern in Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, where he loved to ſit up late, and I begged I might be allowed to paſs an evening with him there ſoon, which he promiſed I ſhould. A few days afterwards I met him near Temple-bar, about one o'clock in the morning, and aſked if he would then go to the Mitre. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) it is too late; they won't let us in. But I'll go with you another night with all my heart."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A revolution of ſome importance in my plan of life had juſt taken place; for inſtead of procuring a commiſſion in the foot-guards, which was my own inclination, I had, in compliance with my father's wiſhes, agreed to ſtudy the law, and was ſoon to ſet out for Utrecht, to hear the lectures of an excellent Civilian in that Univerſity, and then to proceed on my travels. Though very deſirous of obtaining Dr. Johnſon's advice and inſtructions on the mode of purſuing my ſtudies, I was at this time ſo occupied, ſhall I call it? or ſo diſſipated, by the amuſements of London, that our next meeting was not till Saturday, June 25, when happening to dine at Clifton's eating-houſe, in Butcher-row, I was ſurprized to perceive Johnſon come in and take his ſeat at another table. The mode of dining, or rather being fed at ſuch houſes in London, is well known to many to be particularly unſocial, as there is no Ordinary, or united company, but each perſon has his own meſs, and is under no obligation to hold any intercourſe with any one. A liberal and full-minded man, however, who loves to talk, will break through this churliſh and unſocial reſtraint. Johnſon and an Iriſh gentleman got into a diſpute concerning the cauſe of ſome part of mankind being black. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) it has been accounted for in three ways: either by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they are the poſterity of Ham, who was curſed; or that GOD at firſt created two kinds of men, one black and another white; or that by the heat of the ſun the ſkin is ſcorched, and ſo acquires a ſooty hue. This matter has
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0548300101:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been much canvaſſed among naturaliſts, but has never been brought to any certain iſſue."</q> What the Iriſhman ſaid is totally obliterated from my mind; but I remember that he became very warm and intemperate in his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; upon which Johnſon roſe, and quietly walked away. When he had retired, his antagoniſt took his revenge, as he thought, by ſaying <q rend="inline">"He has a moſt ungainly figure, and an affectation of pompoſity unworthy of a man of genius."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon had not obſerved that I was in the room. I followed him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and he agreed to meet me in the evening at the Mitre. I called on him, and we went thither at nine. We had a good ſupper, and port wine, of which he then ſometimes drank a bottle. The orthodox high-church ſound of the Mitre, the figure and manner of the celebrated Samuel Johnſon, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power and preciſion of his converſation, and the pride ariſing from finding myſelf admitted as his companion, produced a variety of ſenſations, and a pleaſing elevation of mind beyond what I had ever before experienced. I find in my journal the following minute of our converſation, which, though it will give but a very faint notion of what paſſed, is, in ſome degree, a valuable record; and it will be curious in this view, as ſhewing how habitual to his mind were ſome opinions which appear in his works.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Colley Cibber, Sir, was by no means a blockhead; but by arrogating to himſelf too much, he was in danger of loſing that degree of eſtimation to which he was entitled. His friends gave out that he <hi>intended</hi> his birth-day Odes ſhould be bad: but that was not the caſe, Sir; for he kept them many months by him, and a few years before he died he ſhewed me one of them, with great ſolicitude to render it as perfect as might be, and I made ſome corrections, to which he was not very willing to ſubmit. I remember the following couplet in alluſion to the King and himſelf:
<q>
                        <l>'Perch'd on the eagle's ſoaring wing</l>
                        <l>'The lowly linnet loves to ſing.'</l>
                     </q>
Sir, he had heard ſomething of the fabulous tale of the wren ſitting upon the eagle's wing, and he had applied it to a linnet. Cibber's familiar ſtyle, however, was better than that which Whitehead has aſſumed. <hi>Grand</hi> nonſenſe is inſupportable. Whitehead is but a little man to inſcribe verſes to players."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I did not preſume to controvert this cenſure, which was tinctured with his prejudice againſt players; but I could not help thinking that a dramatick poet might with propriety pay a compliment to an eminent performer, as Whitehead has very happily done in his verſes to Mr. Garrick.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, I do not think Gray a firſt-rate poet. He has not a bold imagination, nor much command of words. The obſcurity in which he has involved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will not perſuade us that he is ſublime. His Elegy in a church-yard has a happy ſelection of images, but I don't like what are called his great things. His Ode which begins
<q>
                        <l>'Ruin ſeize thee, ruthleſs King,</l>
                        <l>'Confuſion on thy banners wait,'</l>
                     </q>
has been celebrated for its abruptneſs, and plunging into the ſubject all at once. But ſuch arts as theſe have no merit, unleſs when they are original. We admire them only once; and this abruptneſs has nothing new in it. We have had it often before. Nay, we have it in the old ſong of Johnny Armſtrong:
<q>
                        <l>'Is there ever a man in all Scotland</l>
                        <l>'From the higheſt eſtate to the loweſt degree, &amp;c.'</l>
                     </q>
And then, Sir,
<q>
                        <l>'Yes, there is a man in Weſtmoreland,</l>
                        <l>'And Johnny Armſtrong they do him call.'</l>
                     </q>
There, now, you plunge at once into the ſubject. You have no previous narration to lead you to it.—The two next lines in that Ode are, I think, very good:
<q>
                        <l>'Though fann'd by conqueſt's crimſon wing,</l>
                        <l>'They mock the air with idle ſtate <note n="2" place="bottom">My friend Mr. Malone, in his valuable comments on Shakſpeare, has traced in that great poet the <hi>disjecta membra</hi> of theſe lines.</note>."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here let it be obſerved, that although his opinion of Gray's poetry was widely different from mine, and I believe from that of moſt men of taſte, by whom it is with juſtice highly admired, there is certainly much abſurdity in the clamour which has been raiſed, as if he had been culpably injurious to the merit of that bard, and had been actuated by envy. Alas! ye little ſhort-ſighted criticks, could Johnſon be envious of the talents of any of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries? That his opinion on this ſubject was what in private and in publick he uniformly expreſſed, regardleſs of what others might think, we may wonder, and perhaps regret; but it is ſhallow and unjuſt to charge him with expreſſing what he did not think.</p>

Finding him in a placid humour, and wiſhing to avail myſelf of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which I fortunately had of conſulting a ſage, to hear whoſe wiſdom, I conceived in the ardour of youthful imagination, that men filled with a noble enthuſiaſm for intellectual improvement would gladly have reſorted from diſtant lands; I opened my mind to him ingenuouſly, and gave him a little ſketch of my life, to which he was pleaſed to liſten with great attention.</p>
               <p>I acknowledged, that though educated very ſtrictly in the principles of religion, I had for ſome time been miſled into a certain degree of infidelity; but that I was come now to a better way of thinking, and was fully ſatisfied of the truth of the Chriſtian revelation, though I was not clear as to every point conſidered to be orthodox. Being at all times a curious examiner of the human mind, and pleaſed with an undiſguiſed diſplay of what had paſſed in it, he called to me with warmth, <q rend="inline">"Give me your hand; I have taken a liking to you."</q> He then began to deſcant upon the force of teſtimony, and the little we could know of final cauſes; ſo that the objections of, why was it ſo? or why was it not ſo? ought not to diſturb us: adding, that he himſelf had at one period been guilty of a temporary neglect of religion, but that it was not the reſult of argument, but mere abſence of thought.</p>
               <p>After having given credit to reports of his bigotry, I was agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized when he expreſſed the following very liberal ſentiment, which has the additional value of obviating an objection to our holy religion, founded upon the diſcordant tenets of Chriſtians themſelves: <q rend="inline">"For my part, Sir, I think all Chriſtians, whether Papiſts or Proteſtants, agree in the eſſential articles, and that their differences are trivial, and rather political than religious."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of belief in ghoſts. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I make a diſtinction between what a man may experience by the mere ſtrength of his imagination, and what imagination cannot poſſibly produce. Thus, ſuppoſe I ſhould think that I ſaw a form, and heard a voice cry 'Johnſon, you are a very wicked fellow, and unleſs you repent you will certainly be puniſhed;' my own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs is ſo deeply impreſſed upon my mind, that I might <hi>imagine</hi> I thus ſaw and heard, and therefore I ſhould not believe that an external communication had been made to me. But if a form ſhould appear, and a voice ſhould tell me that a particular man had died at a particular place, and a particular hour, a fact which I had no apprehenſion of, nor any means of knowing, and this fact with all its circumſtances ſhould afterwards be unqueſtionably proved, I ſhould, in that caſe be perſuaded that I had ſupernatural intelligence imparted to me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is proper, once for all, to give a true and fair ſtatement of Johnſon's way of thinking upon the queſtion whether departed ſpirits are ever permitted
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0548300101:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 to appear in this world, or in any way to operate upon human life. He has been ignorantly miſrepreſented as weakly credulous upon that ſubject; and therefore, though I feel an inclination to diſdain and treat with ſilent contempt ſo abſurd a notion concerning my illuſtrious friend, yet as I find it has gained ground, it is neceſſary to refute it. The real fact then is, that Johnſon had a very philoſophical mind, and ſuch a rational reſpect for teſtimony, as to make him ſubmit his underſtanding to what was authentically proved, though he could not comprehend why it was ſo. Being thus diſpoſed, he was willing to inquire into the truth of any relation of ſupernatural agency, a general belief of which has prevailed in all nations and ages. But ſo far was he from being the dupe of implicit faith, that he examined the matter with a jealous attention, and no man was more ready to refute its falſhood when he had diſcovered it. Churchill, in his poem entitled <q rend="inline">"The Ghoſt,"</q> availed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the abſurd credulity imputed to Johnſon, and drew a caricature of him under the name of <q rend="inline">"POMPOSO,"</q> repreſenting him as one of the believers of the ſtory of a Ghoſt in Cock-lane, which in the year 1762 had gained very general credit in London. Many of my readers, I am convinced, are to this hour under an impreſſion that Johnſon was thus fooliſhly deceived. It will therefore ſurprize them a good deal when they are informed upon undoubted authority, that Johnſon was one of thoſe by whom the impoſture was detected. The ſtory had become ſo popular, that he thought it ſhould be inveſtigated; and in this reſearch he was aſſiſted by the Reverend Dr. Douglas, now Biſhop of Carliſle, the great detecter of impoſtures, who informs me, that after the gentlemen who went and examined into the evidence were ſatisfied of its falſity, Johnſon wrote in their preſence an account of it, which was publiſhed in the newſpapers and Gentleman's Magazine, and undeceived the world <note n="3" place="bottom">
                     <p>The account was as follows: <q rend="inline">"On the night of the 1ſt of February, many gentlemen, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their rank and character, were, by the invitation of the Reverend Mr. Aldrich, of Clerkenwell, aſſembled at his houſe, for the examination of the noiſes ſuppoſed to be made by a departed ſpirit, for the detection of ſome enormous crime.</q>

                     <q>
                        <p>About ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl ſuppoſed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by a ſpirit, had, with proper caution, been put to bed by ſeveral ladies. They ſat rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down ſtairs, when they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied, in the ſtrongeſt terms, any knowledge or belief of fraud.</p>
                        <p>The ſuppoſed ſpirit had before publickly promiſed, by an affirmative knock, that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the valut under the church of St. John, Clerkenwell, where the body is depoſited, and give a token of her preſence there, by a knock upon her coffin; it was therefore determined to make this trial of the exiſtence or veracity of the ſuppoſed ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>While they were enquiring and deliberating, they were ſummoned into the girl's chamber by ſome ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and ſcratches. When the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men entered, the girl declared that ſhe felt the ſpirit like a mouſe upon her back, and was required to hold her hands out of bed. From that time, though the ſpirit was very ſolemnly required to manifeſt its exiſtence by appearance, by impreſſion on the hand or body of any preſent, by ſcratches, knocks, or any other agency, no evidence of any preter-natural power was exhibited.</p>
                        <p>The ſpirit was then very ſeriouſly advertiſed that the perſon to whom the promiſe was made of ſtriking the coffin, was then about to viſit the vault, and that the performance of the promiſe was then claimed. The company at one o'clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom the promiſe was made, went with another into the vault. The ſpirit was ſolemnly required to perform its promiſe, but nothing more than ſilence enſued: the perſon ſuppoſed to be accuſed by the ſpirit, then went down with ſeveral others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they examined the girl, but could draw no confeſſion from her. Between two and three ſhe deſired and was permitted to go home with her father.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, the opinion of the whole aſſembly, that the child has ſome art of making or counterfeiting a particular noiſe, and that there is no agency of any higher cauſe.</p>

Our converſation proceeded. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) I am a friend to ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as moſt conducive to the happineſs of ſociety. There is a reciprocal pleaſure in governing and being governed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Dr. Goldſmith is one of the firſt men we now have as an authour, and he is a very worthy man too. He has been looſe in his principles, but he is coming right."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Mallet's tragedy of ELVIRA, which had been acted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding winter at Drury-lane, and that the Honourable Andrew Erſkine, Mr. Dempſter, and myſelf, had joined in writing a pamphlet, entitled <q rend="inline">"Critical Strictures"</q> againſt it <note n="4" place="bottom">The Critical Review, in which Mallet himſelf ſometimes wrote, characteriſed this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet as <q rend="inline">"the crude efforts of envy, petulance, and ſelf-conceit."</q> There being thus three epithets, we the three authours had a humourous contention how each ſhould be appropriated.</note>. That the mildneſs of Dempſter's diſpoſition had, however, relented; and he had candidly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We have hardly a right to abuſe this tragedy; for, bad as it is, how vain ſhould either of us be to write one not near ſo good."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir; this is not juſt reaſoning. You <hi>may</hi> abuſe a tragedy, though you cannot write one. You may ſcold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to make tables."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I talked to him of the paternal eſtate to which I was heir, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, let me tell you, that to be a Scotch landlord, where you have a number of families dependent upon you, and attached to you, is, perhaps, as high a ſituation as humanity can arrive at. A merchant upon the 'Change of London, with a hundred thouſand pounds, is nothing: an Engliſh duke,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0548300101:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 with an immenſe fortune, is nothing: he has no tenants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as under his patriarchal care, and who will follow him to the field upon any emergency."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His notion of the dignity of a Scotch landlord had been formed upon what he had heard of the Highland Chiefs; for it is long ſince a lowland landlord has been ſo curtailed in his feudal authority, that he has little more influence over his tenants than an Engliſh landlord; and of late years moſt of the Highland Chiefs have deſtroyed, by means too well known, the princely power which they once enjoyed.</p>
               <p>He proceeded: <q rend="inline">"Your going abroad, Sir, and breaking off idle habits, may be of great importance to you. I would go where there are courts and learned men. There is a good deal of Spain that has not been perambulated. I would have you go thither. A man of inferiour talents to yours may furniſh us with uſeful obſervations upon that country."</q> His ſuppoſing me, at that period of life, capable of writing an account of my travels that would deſerve to be read, elated me not a little.</p>
               <p>I appeal to every impartial reader whether this faithful detail of his frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, complacency, and kindneſs to a young man, a ſtranger and a Scotchman, does not refute the unjuſt opinion of the harſhneſs of his general demeanour. His occaſional reproofs of folly, impudence, or impiety, and even the ſudden ſallies of his conſtitutional irritability of temper, which have been preſerved for the poignancy of their wit, have produced that opinion among thoſe who have not conſidered that ſuch inſtances, though collected by Mrs. Piozzi into a ſmall volume, and read over in a few hours, were, in fact, ſcattered through a long ſeries of years; years, in which his time was chiefly ſpent in inſtructing and delighting mankind by his writings and converſation, in acts of piety to GOD, and good-will to men.</p>
               <p>I complained to him that I had not yet acquired much knowledge, and aſked his advice as to my ſtudies. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Don't talk of ſtudy now. I will give you a plan; but it will require ſome time to conſider of it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"It is very good in you, Mr. Johnſon, (I replied) to allow me to be with you thus. Had it been foretold to me ſome years ago that I ſhould paſs an eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the authour of the RAMBLER, how ſhould I have exulted!"</q> What I then expreſſed was ſincerely from the heart. He was ſatisfied that it was, and cordially anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I am glad we have met. I hope we ſhall paſs many evenings and mornings too, together."</q> We finiſhed a couple of bottles of port, and ſat till between one and two in the morning.</p>

He wrote this year in the Critical Review the account of <q rend="inline">"Telemachus, a Maſk,"</q> by the Reverend George Graham, of Eton College. The ſubject of this beautiful poem was particularly intereſting to Johnſon, who had much experience of <q rend="inline">"the conflict of oppoſite principles,"</q> which he deſcribes as, <q rend="inline">"The contention between pleaſure and virtue, a ſtruggle which will always be continued while the preſent ſyſtem of nature ſhall ſubſiſt: nor can hiſtory or poetry exhibit more than pleaſure triumphing over virtue, and virtue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugating pleaſure."</q>

               <p>As Dr. Oliver Goldſmith will frequently appear in this narrative, I ſhall endeavour to make my readers in ſome degree acquainted with his ſingular character. He was a native of Ireland, and a contemporary with Mr. Burke, at Trinity College, Dublin, but did not then give much promiſe of future celebrity. He, however, obſerved to Mr. Malone, that <q rend="inline">"though he made no great figure in mathematicks, which was a ſtudy in much repute there, he could turn an Ode of Horace better than any of them."</q> He afterwards ſtudied phyſick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t Edinburgh, and upon the Continent; and I have been informed, was enabled to purſue his travels on foot, partly by demanding at Univerſities to enter the liſts as a diſputant, by which, according to the cuſtom of many of them, he was entitled to the premium of a crown, when luckily for him his challenge was not accepted; ſo that, as I once obſerved to Dr. Johnſon, he <hi>diſputed</hi> his paſſage through Europe. He then came to England, and was employed ſucceſſively in the capacities of an uſher to an academy, a corrector of the preſs, a reviewer, and a writer for a newſpaper. He had ſagacity enough to cultivate aſſiduouſly the acquaintance of Johnſon, and his faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of ſuch a model. To me and many others it appeared that he ſtudiouſly copied the manner of Johnſon, though, indeed, upon a ſmaller ſcale.</p>
               <p>At this time I think he had publiſhed nothing with his name, though it was pretty generally known that <hi>one Dr. Goldſmith</hi> was the authour of <q rend="inline">"An Eſſay on the preſent State of polite Literature,"</q> and of <q rend="inline">"The Citizen of the World,"</q> a ſeries of letters ſuppoſed to be written from London by a Chineſe. No man had the art of diſplaying with more advantage as a writer, whatever literary acquiſitions he made. <q rend="inline">

There was a quick, but not a ſtrong vegetation, of whatever chanced to be thrown upon it. No deep root could be ſtruck. The oak of the foreſt did not grow there; but the elegant

 ſhrubbery and the fragrant parterre appeared in gay ſucceſſion. It has been generally circulated and believed that he was a mere fool in converſation <note n="6" place="bottom">In alluſion to this, Mr. Horace Walpole, who admired his writings, ſaid he was <q rend="inline">"an inſpired ideot;"</q> and Garrick deſcribed him as one

Sir Joſhua Reynolds has mentioned to me that he frequently heard Goldſmith talk warmly of the pleaſure of being liked, and obſerve how hard it would be if literary excellence ſhould preclude a man from that ſatisfaction, which he perceived it often did, from the envy which attended it; and therefore Sir Joſhua was convinced that he was intentionally more abſurd, in order to leſſen himſelf in ſocial intercourſe, truſting that his character would be ſufficiently ſupported by his works. If it indeed was his intention to appear abſurd in company, he was often very ſucceſsful. But with due deference to Sir Joſhua's ingenuity, I think the conjecture too refined.</note>; but, in truth, this has been greatly exaggerated. He had, no doubt, a more than common ſhare of that hurry of ideas which we often find in his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and which ſometimes produces a laughable confuſion in expreſſing them. He was very much what the French call <hi>un etourdi,</hi> and from vanity and an eager deſire of being conſpicuous wherever he was, he frequently talked care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly without knowledge of the ſubject, or even without thought. His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſhort, his countenance coarſe and vulgar, his deportment that of a ſcholar aukwardly affecting the eaſy gentleman. Thoſe who were in any way diſtinguiſhed, excited envy in him to ſo ridiculous an exceſs, that the inſtances of it are hardly credible. When accompanying two beautiful young ladies with their mother on a tour in France, he was ſeriouſly angry that more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was paid to them than to him; and once at the exhibition of the <hi>Fantoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini,</hi> in London, when thoſe who ſat next him obſerved with what dexterity a puppet was made to toſs a pike, he could not bear that it ſhould have ſuch praiſe, and exclaimed with ſome warmth, <q rend="inline">"Pſhaw! I can do it better myſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He, I am afraid, had no ſettled ſyſtem of any ſort, ſo that his conduct muſt not be ſtrictly ſcrutiniſed; but his affections were ſocial and generous, and when he had money he gave it away very liberally. His deſire of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſequence predominated over his attention to truth. When he began to riſe into notice, he ſaid he had a brother who was Dean of Durham, a fiction ſo eaſily detected, that it is wonderful how he ſhould have been ſo inconſiderate as to hazard it. He boaſted to me at this time of the power of his pen in commanding money, which I believe was true in a certain degree, though in the inſtance he gave he was by no means correct. He told me that he had ſold a novel for four hundred pounds. This was his <q rend="inline">"Vicar of

Then, to be ſure, it was accidentally worth more money."</q>

               <p>Mrs. Piozzi<note n="7" place="bottom">Anecdotes of Johnſon, p. 119.</note> and Sir John Hawkins<note n="8" place="bottom">Life of Johnſon, p. 420.</note> have ſtrangely miſ-ſtated the hiſtory of Goldſmith's ſituation and Johnſon's friendly interference, when this novel was ſold. I ſhall give it authentically from Johnſon's own exact narration:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I received one morning a meſſage from poor Goldſmith that he was in great diſtreſs, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as ſoon as poſſible. I ſent him a guinea, and promiſed to come to him directly. I accordingly went as ſoon as I was dreſt, and found that his landlady had arreſted him for his rent, at which he was in a violent paſſion. I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a glaſs before him. I put the cork into the bottle, deſired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me that he had a novel ready for the preſs, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and ſaw its merit; told the landlady I ſhould ſoon return, and having gone to a bookſeller, ſold it for ſixty pounds. I brought Goldſmith the money, and he diſcharged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having uſed him ſo ill <note n="9" place="bottom">It may not be improper to annex here Mrs. Piozzi's account of this tranſaction, in her own words, as a ſpecimen of the extreme inaccuracy with which all her anecdotes of Dr. Johnſon are related, or rather diſcoloured and diſtorted. <q rend="inline">"I have forgotten the year, but it could ſcarcely I think be later than 1765 or 1766, that he was <hi>called abruptly from our houſe after dinner,</hi> and returning <hi>in about three hours,</hi> ſaid he had been with an enraged authour, whoſe landlady preſſed him for payment within doors, while the bailiffs beſet him without; that he was <hi>drinking himſelf drunk</hi> with Madeira, to drown care, and fretting over a novel, which, when <hi>finiſhed,</hi> was to be his <hi>whole fortune,</hi> but <hi>he could not get it done for diſtraction,</hi> nor could he ſtep out of doors to offer it for ſale. Mr. Johnſon, therefore, ſet away the bottle, and went to the bookſeller, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the performance, and <hi>deſiring ſome immediate relief;</hi> which when he brought back to the writer, <hi>he called the woman of the houſe directly to partake of punch, and paſs their time in merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My next meeting with Johnſon was on Friday the 1ſt of July, when he and I and Dr. Goldſmith ſupped together at the Mitre. I was before this time pretty well acquainted with Goldſmith, who was one of the brighteſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0548300101:257" rendition="simple:additions"/> ornaments of the Johnſonian ſchool. Goldſmith's reſpectful attachment to Johnſon was then at its height; for his own literary reputation had not yet diſtinguiſhed him ſo much as to excite a vain deſire of competition with his great maſter. He had increaſed my admiration of the goodneſs of Johnſon's heart, by incidental remarks in the courſe of converſation, ſuch as, when I mentioned Mr. Levet, whom he entertained under his roof, <q rend="inline">"He is poor and honeſt, which is recommendation enough to Johnſon;"</q> and when I wondered that he was very kind to a man of whom I had heard a very bad character, <q rend="inline">"He is now become miſerable, and that inſures the protection of Johnſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Goldſmith attempted this evening to maintain, I ſuppoſe from an affectation of paradox, that knowledge was not deſirable on its own account, for it often was a ſource of unhappineſs. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that knowledge may in ſome caſes produce unhappineſs, I allow. But, upon the whole, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>per ſe</hi> is certainly an object which every man would wiſh to attain, although, perhaps, he may not take the trouble neceſſary for attaining it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. John Campbell, the celebrated political and biographical writer, being mentioned, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Campbell is a man of much knowledge, and has a good ſhare of imagination. His 'Hermippus Redivivus' is very enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as an account of the Hermetick philoſophy, and as furniſhing a curious hiſtory of the extravagancies of the human mind. If it were merely imaginary, it would be nothing at all. Campbell is not always rigidly careful of truth in his converſation; but I do not believe there is any thing of this careleſſneſs in his books. Campbell is a good man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not been in the inſide of a church for many years <note n="1" place="bottom">I am inclined to think that he was miſinformed as to this circumſtance. I own I am jealous for my worthy friend Dr. John Campbell. For though Milton could without remorſe abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from publick worſhip, I cannot. On the contrary, I have the ſame habitual impreſſions upon my mind, with thoſe of a truly venerable Judge, who ſaid to Mr. Langton, <q rend="inline">"Friend Langton, if I have not been at church on Sunday, I do not feel myſelf eaſy."</q> Dr. Campbell was a ſincerely religious man. Lord Macartney, who is eminent for his variety of knowledge, and attention to men of talents, and knew him well, told me, that when he called on him in a morning, he found him reading a chapter in the Greek New Teſtament, which he informed his Lordſhip was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice. The quantity of Dr. Campbell's compoſition is almoſt incredible, and his labours brought him large profits. Dr. Joſeph Warton told me that Johnſon ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">"He is the richeſt authour that ever grazed the common of literature."</q>
                     </note>; but he never paſſes a church without pulling off his hat. This ſhews that he has good principles. I uſed to go pretty often to Campbell's on a Sunday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till I began to conſider that the ſhoals of Scotchmen who flocked about
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0548300101:258"/>
him might probably ſay, when any thing of mine was well done, 'Ay, ay, he has learnt this of CAWMELL!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked very contemptuouſly of Churchill's poetry, obſerving, that <q rend="inline">"it had a temporary currency, only from its audacity of abuſe, and being filled with living names, and that it would ſink into oblivion."</q> I ventured to hint that he was not quite a fair judge, as Churchill had attacked him violently. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I am a very fair judge. He did not attack me violently till he found I did not like his poetry; and his attack on me ſhall not prevent me from continuing to ſay what I think of him, from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that it may be aſcribed to reſentment. No, Sir, I called the fellow a blockhead at firſt, and I will call him a blockhead ſtill. However, I will acknowledge that I have a better opinion of him now, than I once had; for he has ſhewn more fertility than I expected. To be ſure, he is a tree that cannot produce good fruit: he only bears crabs. But, Sir, a tree that produces a great many crabs is better than a tree which produces only a few."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this depreciation of Churchill's poetry I could not agree with him. It is very true that the greateſt part of it is upon the topicks of the day, on which account, as it brought him great fame and profit at the time, it muſt proportionally ſlide out of the publick attention as other occaſional objects ſucceed. But Churchill had extraordinary vigour both of thought and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. His portraits of the players will ever be valuable to the true lovers of the drama; and his ſtrong caricatures of ſeveral eminent men of his age, will not be forgotten by the curious. Let me add, that there are in his works many paſſages which are of a general nature; and his <q rend="inline">"Prophecy of Famine"</q> is a poem of no ordinary merit. It is, indeed, falſely injurious to Scotland; but therefore may be allowed a greater ſhare of invention.</p>
               <p>Bonnel Thornton had juſt publiſhed a burleſque <q rend="inline">"Ode on St. Cecilia's day, adapted to the ancient Britiſh muſick, viz. the ſalt-box, the Jew's-harp, the marrow-bones and cleaver, the hum-ſtrum or hurdy-gurdy, &amp;c."</q> Johnſon praiſed its humour, and ſeemed much diverted with it. He repeated the following paſſage:</p>

 I mentioned the periodical paper called THE CONNOISSEUR. He ſaid it wanted matter.—No doubt it has not the deep thinking of Johnſon's writings. But ſurely it has juſt views of the ſurface of life, and a very ſprightly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. His opinion of THE WORLD was not much higher than of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur.</p>
               <p>Let me here apologize for the imperfect manner in which I am obliged to exhibit Johnſon's converſation at this period. In the early part of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him, I was ſo wrapt in admiration of his extraordinary colloquial talents, and ſo little accuſtomed to his peculiar mode of expreſſion, that I found it extremely difficult to recollect and record his converſation with its genuine vigour and vivacity. In progreſs of time, when my mind was, at it were, ſtrongly impregnated with the Johnſonian aether, I could, with much more facility and exactneſs, carry in my memory and commit to paper the exuberant variety of his wiſdom and wit.</p>
               <p>At this time Miſs Williams, as ſhe was then called, though ſhe did not reſide with him in the Temple under his roof, but had lodgings in Bolt-court, Fleet-ſtreet, had ſo much of his attention, that he every night drank tea with her before he went home, however late it might be, and ſhe always ſat up for him. This, it may be fairly conjectured, was not alone a proof of his regard for her, but of his own unwillingneſs to go into ſolitude before that unſeaſonable hour at which he had habituated himſelf to expect the oblivion of repoſe. Dr. Goldſmith, being a privileged man, went with him this night, ſtrutting away, and calling to me with an air of ſuperiority, like that of an eſoterick over an exoterick diſciple of a ſage of antiquity, <q rend="inline">"I go to Miſs Williams."</q> I confeſs, I then envied him this mighty privilege, of which he ſeemed ſo proud; but it was not long before I obtained the ſame mark of diſtinction.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday the 5th of July, I again viſited Johnſon. He told me he had looked into the poems of a certain pretty voluminous modern writer, which had lately come out, but could find no thinking in them. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is there not imagination in them, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, there is in them what <hi>was</hi> imagination, but it is no more imagination in <hi>him,</hi> than ſound is ſound in the echo. And his diction too is not his own. We have long ago ſeen <hi>white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed innocence,</hi> and <hi>flower-beſpangled meads."</hi>

               <p>Talking of London, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Sir, if you wiſh to have a juſt notion of the magnitude of this city, you muſt not be ſatisfied with ſeeing its great ſtreets and ſquares, but muſt ſurvey the innumerable little lanes and courts. It is not in the ſhewy evolutions of buildings, but in the multiplicity of human
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0548300101:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
habitations which are crouded together, that the wonderful immenſity of London conſiſts."</q>—I have often amuſed myſelf with thinking how different a place London is to different people. They, whoſe narrow minds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to the conſideration of ſome one particular purſuit, view it only through that medium. A politician thinks of it merely as the ſeat of government in its different departments; a grazier, as a vaſt market for cattle; a mercantile man, as a place where a prodigious deal of buſineſs is done upon 'Change; a dramatick enthuſiaſt, as the grand ſcene of theatrical entertainments; a man of pleaſure, as an aſſemblage of taverns, and the great emporium for ladies of eaſy virtue. But the intellectual man is ſtruck with it, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the whole of human life in all its variety, the contemplation of which is inexhauſtible.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, July 6, he was engaged to ſup with me at my lodgings in Downing-ſtreet, Weſtminſter. But on the preceding night my landlord having behaved very rudely to me and ſome company who were with me, I had reſolved not to remain another night in his houſe. I was exceedingly uneaſy at the aukward appearance I ſuppoſed I ſhould make to Johnſon and the other gentlemen whom I had invited, not being able to receive them at home, and being obliged to order ſupper at the Mitre. I went to Johnſon in the morning, and talked of it as of a ſerious diſtreſs. He laughed, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Conſider, Sir, how inſignificant this will appear a twelvemonth hence."</q>—Were this conſideration to be applied to moſt of the little vexatious incidents of life, by which our quiet is too often diſturbed, it would prevent many painful ſenſations. I have tried it frequently, with good effect. <q rend="inline">"There is nothing (continued he) in this mighty misfortune; nay, we ſhall be better at the Mitre."</q> I told him that I had been at Sir John Fielding's office, complaining of my landlord, and had been informed, that though I had taken my lodgings for a year, I might, upon proof of his bad behaviour, quit them when I pleaſed, without being under an obligation to pay rent for any longer time than while I poſſeſſed them. The fertility of Johnſon's mind could ſhew itſelf even upon ſo ſmall a matter as this. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) I ſuppoſe this muſt be the law, ſince you have been told ſo in Bow-ſtreet. But, if your landlord could hold you to your bargain, and the lodgings ſhould be yours for a year, you may certainly uſe them as you think fit. So, Sir, you may quarter two life-guardmen upon him; or you may ſend the greateſt ſcoundrel you can find into your apartments; or you may ſay that you want to make ſome experiments in natural philoſophy, and may burn a large quantity of aſſafoetida in his houſe."</q>

 I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great ſubject of this work to be loſt. Though a ſmall particular may appear trifling to ſome, it will be reliſhed by others, while every little ſpark adds ſomething to the general blaze. And to pleaſe the true, candid, warm admirers of Johnſon, and in any degree increaſe the ſplendour of his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I bid defiance to the ſhafts of ridicule, or even of malignity; thouſands of them have been diſcharged at my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> yet it ſtill ſails unhurt <q rend="inline">"along the ſtream of time,"</q> and as an attendant upon Johnſon,—<q rend="inline">"Purſues the triumph, and partakes the gale."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I had as my gueſts this evening at the Mitre tavern, Dr. Johnſon, Dr. Goldſmith, Mr. Thomas Davies, Mr. Eccles, an Iriſh gentleman, for whoſe agreeable company I was obliged to Mr. Davies, and the Reverend Mr. Ogilvie, a Scotch clergyman, authour of ſeveral poems, who was very deſirous of being in company with my illuſtrious friend, while I, in my turn, was proud to have the honour of ſhewing one of my countrymen upon what eaſy terms Johnſon permitted me to live with him.</p>
               <p>Goldſmith, as uſual, endeavoured, with too much eagerneſs, to ſhine, and diſputed very warmly with Johnſon againſt the well-known maxim of the Britiſh conſtitution, <q rend="inline">"the King can do no wrong;"</q> affirming, that <q rend="inline">"what was morally falſe could not be politically true; and as the King might, in the exerciſe of his regal power, command and cauſe the doing of what was wrong, it certainly might be ſaid, in ſenſe and in reaſon, that he could do wrong."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you are to conſider, that in our conſtitution, according to its true principles, the King is the head; he is ſupreme; he is above every thing, and there is no power by which he can be tried. Therefore it is, Sir, that we hold the King can do no wrong, that whatever may happen to be wrong in government may not be above our reach, by being aſcribed to Majeſty. Redreſs is always to be had againſt oppreſſion, by puniſhing the immediate agents. The King, though he ſhould command, cannot force a Judge to condemn a man unjuſtly; therefore it is the Judge whom we proſecute and puniſh. Political inſtitutions are formed upon the conſideration of what will moſt frequently tend to the good of the whole, although now and then exceptions may occur. Thus it is better in general that a nation ſhould have a ſupreme legiſlative power, although it may at times be abuſed. And then, Sir, there is this conſideration, that <hi>if the abuſe be enormous, Nature will riſe up, and claiming her original rights, overturn a corrupt political ſyſtem."</hi>
                  </q> I mark this animated ſentence with peculiar pleaſure, as a noble inſtance of that truly dignified ſpirit of freedom which ever glowed in his heart, though he was
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0548300101:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>
charged with ſlaviſh tenets by ſuperficial obſervers, becauſe he was at all times indignant againſt that falſe patriotiſm, that pretended love of freedom, that unruly reſtleſſneſs, which is inconſiſtent with the ſtable authority of any good government.</p>
               <p>This generous ſentiment, which he uttered with great fervour, ſtruck me exceedingly, and ſtirred my blood to that pitch of fancied reſiſtance, the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of which I am glad to keep in mind, but to which I truſt I never ſhall be forced.</p>

               <p>Talking of the eminent writers in Queen Anne's reign, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"I think Dr. Arbuthnot the firſt man among them. He was the moſt univerſal genius, being an excellent phyſician, a man of deep learning, and a man of much humour.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Ogilvie was unlucky enough to chooſe for the topick of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the praiſes of his native country. He began with ſaying, that there was very rich land round Edinburgh. Goldſmith, who had ſtudied phyſick there, contradicted this, very untruly, with a ſneering laugh. Diſconcerted a little by this, Mr. Ogilvie then took new ground, where, I ſuppoſe, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perfectly ſafe; for he obſerved, that Scotland had a great many noble wild proſpects. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir, you have a great many. Norway, too, has noble wild proſpects; and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild proſpects. But, Sir, let me tell you, the nobleſt proſpect which a Scotchman ever ſees, is the high road that leads him to England!"</q> This unexpected and pointed ſally produced a roar of applauſe. After all, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, thoſe, who admire the rude grandeur of Nature, cannot deny it to Caledonia.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, July 9, I found Johnſon ſurrounded with a numerous levee, but have not preſerved any part of his converſation. On the 14th we had another evening by ourſelves at the Mitre. It happening to be a very rainy
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0548300101:263" rendition="simple:additions"/> night, I made ſome common-place obſervations on the relaxation of nerves and depreſſion of ſpirits which ſuch weather occaſioned; adding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, that it was good for the vegetable creation. Johnſon, who, as we have already ſeen, denied that the temperature of the air had any influence on the human frame, anſwered, with a ſmile of ridicule, <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir, it is good for vegetables, and for the animals who eat thoſe animals."</q> This obſervation of his aptly enough introduced a good ſupper; and I ſoon forgot, in Johnſon's company, the influence of a moiſt atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>Feeling myſelf now quite at eaſe as his companion, though I had all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reverence for him, I expreſſed a regret that I could not be ſo eaſy with my father, though he was not much older than him, and certainly had not more learning and greater abilities to depreſs me. I aſked him the reaſon of this. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I am a man of the world. I live in the world, and I take, in ſome degree, the colour of the world as it moves along. Your father is a Judge in a remote part of the iſland, and all his notions are taken from the old world. Beſides, Sir, there muſt always be a ſtruggle between a father and ſon, while one aims at power and the other at independence."</q> I ſaid, I was afraid my father would force me to be a lawyer. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you need not be afraid of his forcing you to be a laborious practiſing lawyer; that is not in his power. For as the proverb ſays, 'One man may lead a horſe to the water, but twenty cannot make him drink.' He may be diſpleaſed that you are not what he wiſhes you to be; but that diſpleaſure will not go far. If he inſiſts only on your having as much law as is neceſſary for a man of property, and then endeavours to get you into Parliament, he is quite in the right."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He enlarged very convincingly upon the excellence of rhyme over blank verſe in Engliſh poetry. I mentioned to him that Dr. Adam Smith, in his lectures upon compoſition, when I ſtudied under him in the College of Glaſgow, had maintained the ſame opinion ſtrenuouſly, and I repeated ſome of his arguments. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I was once in company with Smith, and we did not take to each other; but had I known that he loved rhyme as much as you tell me he does, I ſhould have HUGGED him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of thoſe who denied the truth of Chriſtianity, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is always eaſy to be on the negative ſide. If a man were now to deny that there is ſalt upon the table, you could not reduce him to an abſurdity. Come, let us try this a little further. I deny that Canada is taken, and I can ſupport my denial by pretty good arguments. The French are a much more numerous
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0548300101:264" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people than we; and it is not likely that they would allow us to take it. 'But the miniſtry have aſſured us, in all the formality of the Gazette, that it is taken.'—Very true. But the miniſtry have put us to an enormous expence by the war in America, and it is their intereſt to perſuade us that we have got ſomething for our money.—'But the fact is confirmed by thouſands of men who were at the taking of it.'—Ay, but theſe men have ſtill more intereſt in deceiving us. They don't want you ſhould think the French have beat them, but that they have beat the French. Now ſuppoſe you ſhould go over and find that it is really taken, that would only ſatisfy yourſelf; for when you come home we will not believe you. We will ſay you have been bribed.—Yet, Sir, notwithſtanding all theſe plauſible objections, we have no doubt that Canada is really ours. Such is the weight of common teſtimony. How much ſtronger are the evidences of the Chriſtian religion?"</q>

               <p>To a man of vigourous intellect and ardent curioſity like his own, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a regular plan may be beneficial; though even ſuch a man muſt ſubmit to it, if he would attain a full underſtanding of any of the ſciences.</p>
               <p>To ſuch a degree of unreſtrained frankneſs had he now accuſtomed me, that in the courſe of this evening I talked of the numerous reflections which had been thrown out againſt him on account of his having accepted a penſion from his preſent Majeſty. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he, with a hearty laugh,) it is a mighty fooliſh noiſe that they make <note n="2" place="bottom">When I mentioned the ſame idle clamour to him ſeveral years afterwards, he ſaid, with a ſmile, <q rend="inline">"I wiſh my penſion were twice as large, that they might make twice as much noiſe."</q>
                     </note>. I have accepted of a penſion as a reward which has been thought due to my literary merit; and now that I have this penſion, I am the ſame man in every reſpect that I have ever been; I retain the ſame principles. It is true, that I cannot now curſe (ſmiling) the houſe of Hanover; nor would it be decent for me to drink King James's health in the wine that King George gives me money to pay for. But, Sir, I think that the pleaſure of curſing the houſe of Hanover, and drinking King James's health, are amply overbalanced by three hundred pounds a year."</q>

                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0548300101:265"/> There was here, moſt certainly, an affectation of more Jacobitiſm than he really had, and indeed an intention of admitting, for the moment, in a much greater extent than it really exiſted, the charge of diſaffection imputed to him by the world, merely for the purpoſe of ſhewing how dexterouſly he could repel an attack, even though he were placed in the moſt diſadvantageous poſition; for I have heard him declare, that if holding up his right hand would have ſecured victory at Culloden to Prince Charles's army, he was not ſure he would have held it up; ſo little confidence had he in the right claimed by the houſe of Stuart, and ſo fearful was he of the conſequences of another revolution on the throne of Great-Britain; and Mr. Topham Beauclerk aſſured me, he had heard him ſay this before he had his penſion. At another time he ſaid to Mr. Langton, <q rend="inline">"Nothing has ever offered that has made it worth my while to conſider the queſtion fully."</q> He, however, alſo ſaid to the ſame gentleman, talking of King James the Second, <q rend="inline">"It was become impoſſible for him to reign any longer in this country."</q> He no doubt had an early attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the houſe of Stuart; but his zeal had cooled as his reaſon ſtrengthened. Indeed I heard him once ſay, that <q rend="inline">"after the death of a violent Whig, with whom he uſed to contend with great eagerneſs, he felt his Toryiſm much abated <note n="3" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 402.</note>."</q> I ſuppoſe he meant Mr. Walmſley.</p>
               <p>He adviſed me, when abroad, to be as much as I could with the Profeſſors in the Univerſities, and with the Clergy; for from their converſation I might expect the beſt accounts of every thing in whatever country I ſhould be, with the additional advantage of keeping my learning alive.</p>
               <p>It will be obſerved, that when giving me advice as to my travels, Dr. Johnſon did not dwell upon cities, and palaces, and pictures, and ſhews, and Arcadian ſcenes. He was of Lord Eſſex's opinion, who adviſes his kinſman Roger Earl of Rutland, <q rend="inline">"rather to go an hundred miles to ſpeak with one wiſe man, than five miles to ſee a fair town <note n="4" place="bottom">Letter to Rutland on Travel, 1596.</note>."</q>

               <p>I added, that the ſame perſon maintained that there was no diſtinction between virtue and vice. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, if the fellow does not think as he

               </p>
               <p>Sir David Dalrymple, now one of the Judges of Scotland by the title of Lord Hailes, had contributed much to increaſe my high opinion of Johnſon, on account of his writings, long before I attained to a perſonal acquaintance with him; I, in return, had informed Johnſon of Sir David's eminent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for learning and religion; and Johnſon was ſo much pleaſed, that at one of our evening meetings he gave him for his toaſt. I at this time kept up a very frequent correſpondence with Sir David; and I read to Dr. Johnſon to-night the following paſſage from the letter which I had laſt received from him:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"It gives me pleaſure to think that you have obtained the friendſhip of Mr. Samuel Johnſon. He is one of the beſt moral writers which England has produced. At the ſame time, I envy you the free and undiſguiſed converſe with ſuch a man. May I beg you to preſent my beſt reſpects to him, and to aſſure him of the veneration which I entertain for the authour of the Rambler and of Raſſelas? Let me recommend this laſt work to you; with the Rambler you certainly are acquainted. In Raſſelas you will ſee a tender-hearted operator, who probes the wound only to heal it. Swift, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, mangles human nature. He cuts and ſlaſhes, as if he took pleaſure in the operation, like the tyrant who ſaid, <hi>Ita feri ut ſe ſentiat emori."</hi>
                  </q> Johnſon ſeemed to be much gratified by this juſt and well-turned compliment.</p>
               <p>He recommended to me to keep a journal of my life, full and unreſerved. He ſaid it would be a very good exerciſe, and would yield me great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the particulars were faded from my remembrance. I was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fortunate in having had a previous coincidence of opinion with him upon this ſubject, for I had kept ſuch a journal for ſome time; and it was no ſmall pleaſure to me to have this to tell him, and to receive his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He counſelled me to keep it private, and ſaid I might ſurely have a friend who would burn it in caſe of my death. From this habit I have been enabled to give the world ſo many anecdotes, which would otherwiſe have been loſt to poſterity. I mentioned that I was afraid I put into my journal too many little incidents. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"There is nothing, Sir, too little for ſo little a creature as man. It is by ſtudying little things that we attain the great art of having as little miſery and as much happineſs as poſſible."</q>

 Next morning Mr. Dempſter happened to call on me, and was ſo much ſtruck even with the imperfect account which I gave him of Dr. Johnſon's converſation, that to his honour be it recorded, when I complained that drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing port and ſitting up late with him, affected my nerves for ſome time after, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"One had better be palſied at eighteen, than not keep company with ſuch a man."</q>

               <p>On Tueſday, July 18, I found tall Sir Thomas Robinſon ſitting with Johnſon. Sir Thomas ſaid, that the King of Pruſſia valued himſelf upon three things;—upon being a hero, a muſician, and an authour. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Pretty well, Sir, for one man. As to his being an authour, I have not looked at his poetry; but his proſe is poor ſtuff. He writes juſt as you might ſuppoſe Voltaire's footboy to do, who has been his amanuenſis. He has ſuch parts as the valet might have, and about as much of the colouring of the ſtyle as might be got by tranſcribing his works."</q> When I was at Ferney, I repeated this to Voltaire, in order to reconcile him ſomewhat to Johnſon, whom he, in affecting the Engliſh mode of expreſſion, had previouſly charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſed as <q rend="inline">"a ſuperſtitious dog;"</q> but after hearing ſuch a criticiſm on Frederick the Great, with whom he was then on bad terms, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"An honeſt fellow!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I think the criticiſm much too ſevere; for the <q rend="inline">"Memoirs of the Houſe of Brandenburgh"</q> are written as well as many works of that kind. His poetry, for the ſtyle of which he himſelf makes a frank apology, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Jargonnant un François barbare,"</hi>
                  </q> though fraught with pernicious ravings of infidelity, has, in many places, great animation, and in ſome a pathetick tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>Upon this contemptuous animadverſion on the King of Pruſſia, I obſerved to Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"It would ſeem then, Sir, that much leſs parts are neceſſary to make a King, than to make an Authour; for the King of Pruſſia is confeſſedly the greateſt King now in Europe, yet you think he makes a very poor figure as an Authour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Levet this day ſhewed me Dr. Johnſon's library, which was contained in two garrets over his Chambers, where Lintot, ſon of the celebrated book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller of that name, had formerly his printing-houſe. I found a number of good books, but very duſty and in great confuſion. The floor was ſtrewed with manuſcript leaves, in Johnſon's own hand-writing, which I beheld with a degree of veneration, ſuppoſing they perhaps might contain portions of the Rambler, or of Raſſelas. I obſerved an apparatus for chymical experiments, of which Johnſon was all his life very fond. The place ſeemed to be very favourable for retirement and meditation. Johnſon told me, that he went up
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0548300101:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thither without mentioning it to his ſervant, when he wanted to ſtudy, ſecure from interruption; for he would not allow his ſervant to ſay he was not at home when he really was. <q rend="inline">"A ſervant's ſtrict regard for truth, (ſaid he) muſt be weakened by ſuch a practice. A philoſopher may know that it is merely a form of denial; but few ſervants are ſuch nice diſtinguiſhers. If I accuſtom a ſervant to tell a lye for <hi>me,</hi> have I not reaſon to apprehend that he will tell many lies for <hi>himſelf?"</hi>
                  </q> I am, however, ſatisfied that every ſervant, of any degree of intelligence, underſtands ſaying his maſter is not at home, not at all as the affirmation of a fact, but as cuſtomary words, intimating that his maſter wiſhes not to be ſeen; ſo that there can be no bad effect from it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Temple, now vicar of St. Gluvias, Cornwall, who had been my inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend for many years, had at this time chambers in Farrar's-buildings, at the bottom of Inner Temple-lane, which he kindly lent me upon my quitting my lodgings, he being to return to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. I found them particularly convenient for me, as they were ſo near Dr. Johnſon's.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, July 20, Dr. Johnſon, Mr. Dempſter, and my uncle Dr. Boſwell, who happened to be now in London, ſupped with me at theſe Chambers. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Pity is not natural to man. Children are always cruel. Savages are always cruel. Pity is acquired and improved by the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of reaſon. We may have uneaſy ſenſations from ſeeing a creature in diſtreſs, without pity; for we have not pity unleſs we wiſh to relieve them. When I am on my way to dine with a friend, and finding it late, have bid the coachman make haſte, if I happen to attend when he whips his horſes, I may feel unpleaſantly that the animals are put to pain, but I do not wiſh him to deſiſt. No, Sir, I wiſh him to drive on."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Alexander Donaldſon, bookſeller of Edinburgh, had for ſome time opened a ſhop in London, and ſold his cheap editions of the moſt popular Engliſh books, in defiance of the ſuppoſed common-law right of <hi>Literary Property.</hi> Johnſon, though he concurred in the opinion which was afterwards ſanctioned by a decree from the Houſe of Lords, that there was no ſuch right, was at this time very angry that the bookſellers of London, for whom he uniformly profeſſed much regard, ſhould ſuffer from an invaſion of what they had ever conſidered to be ſecure, and he was loud and violent againſt Mr. Donaldſon. <q rend="inline">"He is a fellow who takes advantage of the law to injure his brethren; for, notwithſtanding that the ſtatute ſecures only fourteen years of excluſive right, it has always been underſtood by the trade, that he, who buys the copy-right of a book from the authour, obtains a perpetual property; and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0548300101:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 upon that belief, numberleſs bargains are made to transfer that property after the expiration of the ſtatutory term. Now Donaldſon, I ſay, takes advantage here, of people who have really an equitable title from uſage; and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how few of the books, of which they buy the property, ſucceed ſo well as to bring profit, we ſhould be of opinion that the term of fourteen years is too ſhort; it ſhould be ſixty years."</q> DEMPSTER. <q rend="inline">"Donaldſon, Sir, is anxious for the encouragement of literature. He reduces the price of books, ſo that poor ſtudents may buy them."</q> JOHNSON, (laughing.) <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, allowing that to be his motive, he is no better than Robin Hood, who robbed the rich in order to give to the poor."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that when the great queſtion concerning Literary Property came to be ultimately tried before the ſupreme tribunal of this country, in conſequence of the very ſpirited exertions of Mr. Donaldſon, Dr. Johnſon was zealous againſt a perpetuity; but he thought that the term of the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right of authours ſhould be conſiderably enlarged. He was then for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hundred years.</p>
               <p>The converſation now turned upon Mr. David Hume's ſtyle. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, his ſtyle is not Engliſh; the ſtructure of his ſentences is French. Now the French ſtructure and the Engliſh ſtructure may, in the nature of things, be equally good. But if you allow that the Engliſh language is eſtabliſhed, he is wrong. My name might originally have been Nicholſon, as well as Johnſon; but were you to call me Nicholſon now, you would call me very abſurdly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Rouſſeau's treatiſe on the inequality of mankind was at this time a faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able topick. It gave riſe to an obſervation by Mr. Dempſter, that the advantages of fortune and rank were nothing to a wiſe man, who ought to value only merit. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"If man were a ſavage, living in the woods by himſelf, this might be true; but in civiliſed ſociety we all depend upon each other, and our happineſs is very much owing to the good opinion of mankind. Now, Sir, in civiliſed ſociety, external advantages make us more reſpected. A man with a good coat upon his back meets with a better recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than he who has a bad one. Sir, you may analyſe this, and ſay what is there in it? But that will avail you nothing, for it is a part of a general ſyſtem. Pound St. Paul's church into atoms, and conſider any ſingle atom; it is, to be ſure, good for nothing: but, put all theſe atoms together, and you have St. Paul's church. So it is with human felicity, which is made up of many ingredients, each of which may be ſhewn to be very inſignificant. In civiliſed ſociety, perſonal merit will not ſerve you ſo much as money will.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0548300101:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir, you may make the experiment. Go into the ſtreet, and give one man a lecture on morality, and another a ſhilling, and ſee which will reſpect you moſt. If you wiſh only to ſupport nature, Sir William Petty fixes your allowance at three pounds a year; but as times are much altered, let us call it ſix pounds. This ſum will fill your belly, ſhelter you from the weather, and even get you a ſtrong laſting coat, ſuppoſing it to be made of good bull's hide. Now, Sir, all beyond this is artificial, and is deſired in order to obtain a greater degree of reſpect from our fellow-creatures. And, Sir, if ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a year procure a man more conſequence, and, of courſe, more happineſs than ſix pounds a year, the ſame proportion will hold as to ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and ſo on as far as opulence can be carried. Perhaps he who has a large fortune may not be ſo happy as he who has a ſmall one; but that muſt proceed from other cauſes than from his having the large fortune: for, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> he who is rich in a civilized ſociety, muſt be happier than he who is poor; as riches, if properly uſed, (and it is a man's own fault if they are not,) muſt be productive of the higheſt advantages. Money, to be ſure, of itſelf is of no uſe; for its only uſe is to part with it. Rouſſeau, and all thoſe who deal in paradoxes, are led away by a childiſh deſire of novelty. When I was a boy, I uſed always to chooſe the wrong ſide of a debate, becauſe moſt ingenious things, that is to ſay, moſt new things, could be ſaid upon it. Sir, there is nothing for which you may not muſter up more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible arguments, than thoſe which are urged againſt wealth and other external advantages. Why now, there is ſtealing; why ſhould it be thought a crime? When we conſider by what unjuſt methods property has been often acquired, and that what was unjuſtly got it muſt be unjuſt to keep, where is the harm in one man's taking the property of another from him? Beſides, Sir, when we conſider the bad uſe that many people make of their property, and how much better uſe the thief may make of it, it may be defended as a very allowable practice. Yet, Sir, the experience of mankind has diſcovered ſtealing to be ſo very bad a thing, that they make no ſcruple to hang a man for it. When I was running about this town a very poor fellow, I was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty; but I was, at the ſame time, very ſorry to be poor. Sir, all the arguments which are brought to repreſent poverty as no evil, ſhew it to be evidently a great evil. You never find people labouring to convince you that you may live very happily upon a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fortune.—So you hear people talking how miſerable a king muſt be; and yet they all wiſh to be in his place."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was ſuggeſted that kings muſt be unhappy, becauſe they are deprived of the greateſt of all ſatisfactions, eaſy and unreſerved ſociety. JOHNSON.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0548300101:271" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">"That is an ill-founded notion. Being a king does not exclude a man from ſuch ſociety. Great kings have always been ſocial. The King of Pruſſia, the only great king at preſent, is very ſocial. Charles the Second, the laſt King of England who was a man of parts, was ſocial; and our Henrys and Edwards were all ſocial."</q>

               <p>Mr. Dempſter having endeavoured to maintain that intrinſick merit <hi>ought</hi> to make the only diſtinction amongſt mankind. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have found that this cannot be. How ſhall we determine the proportion oſ intrinſick merit? Were that to be the only diſtinction amongſt mankind, we ſhould ſoon quarrel about the degrees of it. Were all diſtinctions aboliſhed, the ſtrongeſt would not long acquieſce, but would endeavour to obtain a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uperiority by their bodily ſtrength. But, Sir, as ſubordination is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſociety, and contentions for ſuperiority very dangerous, mankind, that is to ſay all civiliſed nations, have ſettled it upon a plain invariable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. A man is born to hereditary rank; or his being appointed to certain offices, gives him a certain rank. Subordination tends greatly to human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Were we all upon an equality, we ſhould have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleaſure."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid, I conſidered diſtinction of rank to be of ſo much importance in civiliſed ſociety, that if I were aſked on the ſame day to dine with the firſt duke in England, and with the firſt man in Britain for genius, I ſhould heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate which to prefer. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure, Sir, if you were to dine only once, and it were never to be known where you dined, you would chooſe rather to dine with the firſt man for genius; but to gain moſt reſpect, you ſhould dine with the firſt duke in England. For nine people in ten that you meet with, would have a higher opinion of you for having dined with a duke; and the great genius himſelf would receive you better, becauſe you had been with the great duke."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He took care to guard himſelf againſt any poſſible ſuſpicion that his ſettled principles of reverence for rank and reſpect for wealth were at all owing to mean or intereſted motives; for he aſſerted his own independence as a literary man. <q rend="inline">"No man (ſaid he) who ever lived by literature, has lived more independently than I have done."</q> He ſaid he had taken longer time than he needed to have done in compoſing his Dictionary. He received our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments upon that great work with complacency, and told us that the Academy <hi>della Cruſca</hi> could ſcarcely believe that it was done by one man.</p>
               <p>Next morning I found him alone, and have preſerved the following frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his converſation. Of a gentleman who was mentioned, he ſaid,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0548300101:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"I have not met with any man for a long time who has given me ſuch general diſpleaſure. He is totally unfixed in his principles, and wants to puzzle other people."</q> I ſaid, his principles had been poiſoned by a noted infidel writer, but that he was, nevertheleſs, a benevolent good man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We can have no dependance upon that inſtinctive, that conſtitutional goodneſs which is not founded upon principle. I grant you that ſuch a man may be a very amiable member of ſociety. I can conceive him placed in ſuch a ſituation that he is not much tempted to deviate from what is right; and as every man prefers virtue when there is not ſome ſtrong incitement to tranſgreſs its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, I can conceive him doing nothing wrong. But if ſuch a man ſtood in need of money, I ſhould not like to truſt him; and I ſhould certainly not truſt him with young ladies, for <hi>there</hi> there is always temptation. Hume, and other ſceptical innovators, are vain men, and will gratify themſelves at any expence. Truth will not afford ſufficient food to their vanity; ſo they have betaken themſelves to errour. Truth, Sir, is a cow which will yield ſuch people no more milk, and ſo they are gone to milk the bull. If I could have allowed myſelf to gratify my vanity at the expence of truth, what fame might I have acquired. Every thing which Hume has advanced againſt Chriſtianity had paſſed through my mind long before he wrote. Always remember this, that after a ſyſtem is well ſettled upon poſitive evidence, a few partial objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought not to ſhake it. The human mind is ſo limited, that it cannot take in all the parts of a ſubject, ſo that there may be objections raiſed againſt any thing. There are objections againſt a <hi>plenum,</hi> and objections againſt a <hi>vacuum;</hi> yet one of them muſt certainly be true."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Hume's argument againſt the belief of miracles, that it is more probable that the witneſſes to the truth of them are miſtaken, or ſpeak falſely, than that the miracles ſhould be true. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the great difficulty of proving miracles ſhould make us very cautious in believing them. But let us conſider; although GOD has made Nature to operate by certain fixed laws, yet it is not unreaſonable to think that he may ſuſpend thoſe laws, in order to eſtabliſh a ſyſtem highly advantageous to mankind. Now the Chriſtian religion is a moſt beneficial ſyſtem, as it gives us light and certainty where we were before in darkneſs and doubt. The miracles which prove it are atteſted by men who had no intereſt in deceiving us; but who, on the contrary, were told that they ſhould ſuffer perſecution, and did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>actually lay down their lives in confirmation of the truth of the facts which they aſſerted. Indeed, for ſome centuries the heathens did not pretend to deny the miracles; but ſaid they were performed by the aid of evil ſpirits. This
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0548300101:273" rendition="simple:additions"/> is a circumſtance of great weight. Then, Sir, when we take the proofs derived from prophecies which have been ſo exactly fulfilled, we have moſt ſatisfactory evidence. Suppoſing a miracle poſſible, as to which, in my opinion, there can be no doubt, we have as ſtrong evidence for the miracles in ſupport of Chriſtianity, as the nature of the thing admits."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At night, Mr. Johnſon and I ſupped in a private room at the Turk's Head coffee-houſe, in the Strand. <q rend="inline">"I encourage this houſe (ſaid he); for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of it is a good civil woman, and has not much buſineſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, I love the acquaintance of young people; becauſe, in the firſt place, I don't like to think myſelf growing old. In the next place, young acquaintances muſt laſt longeſt, if they do laſt; and then, Sir, young men have more virtue than old men; they have more generous ſentiments in every reſpect. I love the young dogs of this age: they have more with and humour and knowledge of life than we had; but then the dogs are not ſo good ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Sir, in my early years I read very hard. It is a ſad reflection, but a true one, that I knew almoſt as much at eighteen as I do now. My judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be ſure, was not ſo good; but, I had all the facts. I remember very well, when I was at Oxford, an old gentleman ſaid to me, 'Young man, ply your book diligently now, and acquire a ſtock of knowledge; for when years come upon you, you will find that poring upon books will be but an irkſome taſk."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This account of his reading, given by himſelf in plain words, ſufficiently confirms what I have already advanced upon the diſputed queſtion as to his application. It reconciles any ſeeming inconſiſtency in his way of talking upon it at different times; and ſhews that idleneſs and reading hard were with him relative terms, the import of which, as uſed by him, muſt be gathered from a compariſon with what ſcholars of different degrees of ardour and aſſiduity have been known to do. And let it be remembered, that he was now talking ſpontaneouſly, and expreſſing his genuine ſentiments; whereas at other times he might be induced from his ſpirit of contradiction, or more properly from his love of argumentative conteſt, to ſpeak lightly of his own application to ſtudy. It is pleaſing to conſider that the old gentleman's gloomy prophecy as to the irkſomeneſs of books to men of an advanced age, which is too often fulfilled, was ſo far from being verified in Johnſon, that his ardour for literature never failed, and his laſt writings had more eaſe and vivacity than any of his earlier productions.</p>
               <p>He mentioned to me now, for the firſt time, that he had been diſtreſt by melancholy, and for that reaſon had been obliged to fly from ſtudy and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0548300101:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the diſſipating variety of life. Againſt melancholy he recommended conſtant occupation of mind, a great deal of exerciſe, moderation in eating and drinking, and eſpecially to ſhun drinking at night. He ſaid melancholy people were apt to fly to intemperance for relief, but that it ſunk them much deeper in miſery. He obſerved, that labouring men who work hard, and live ſparingly, are ſeldom or never troubled with low ſpirits.</p>
               <p>He again inſiſted on the duty of maintaining ſubordination of rank. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I would no more deprive a nobleman of his reſpect, than of his money. I conſider myſelf as acting a part in the great ſyſtem of ſociety, and I do to others as I would have them to do to me. I would behave to a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as I ſhould expect he would behave to me, were I a nobleman and he Sam. Johnſon. Sir, there is one Mrs. Macaulay<note n="5" place="bottom">This <hi>one</hi> Mrs. Macaulay was the ſame perſonage who afterwards made herſelf ſo much known as <q rend="inline">"the celebrated female hiſtorian."</q>
                     </note> in this town, a great repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican. One day when I was at her houſe, I put on a very grave countenance, and ſaid to her, 'Madam, I am now become a convert to your way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am convinced that all mankind are upon an equal footing; and to give you an unqueſtionable proof, Madam, that I am in earneſt, here is a very ſenſible, civil, well-behaved fellow-citizen, your footman; I deſire that he may be allowed to ſit down and dine with us.' I thus, Sir, ſhewed her the abſurdity of the levelling doctrine. She has never liked me ſince. Sir, your levellers wiſh to level <hi>down</hi> as far as themſelves; but they cannot bear levelling <hi>up</hi> to themſelves. They would all have ſome people under them; why not then have ſome people above them?"</q> I mentioned a certain authour who diſguſted me by his forwardneſs, and by ſhewing no deference to noblemen into whoſe company he was admitted. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Suppoſe a ſhoemaker ſhould claim an equality with him as he does with a Lord; how would he ſtare. 'Why, Sir, do you ſtare? (ſays the ſhoemaker,) I do great ſervice to ſociety. 'Tis true, I am paid for doing it; but ſo are you, Sir: and I am ſorry to ſay it, better paid than I am, for doing ſomething not ſo neceſſary. For man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could do better without your books, than without my ſhoes.' Thus, Sir, there would be a perpetual ſtruggle for precedence, were there no fixed invariable rules for the diſtinction of rank, which creates no jealouſy, as it is allowed to be accidental."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, Dr. Joſeph Warton was a very agreeable man, and his <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on the Genius and Writings of Pope,"</q> a very pleaſing book. I wondered that he delayed ſo long to give us the continuation of it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0548300101:275" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sir, I ſuppoſe he finds himſelf a little diſappointed, in not having been able to perſuade the world to be of his opinion as to Pope."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We have now been favoured with the concluding volume, in which, to uſe a parliamentary expreſſion, he has <hi>explained,</hi> ſo as not to appear quite ſo adverſe to the opinion of the world concerning Pope, as was at firſt thought; and we muſt all agree, that his work is a moſt valuable acceſſion to Engliſh literature.</p>
               <p>A writer of deſerved eminence being mentioned, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he is a man of good parts, but being originally poor, he has got a love of mean company and low jocularity; a very bad thing, Sir. To laugh is good, as to talk is good. But you ought no more to think it enough if you laugh, than you are to think it enough if you talk. You may laugh in as many ways as you talk; and ſurely <hi>every</hi> way of talking that is practiſed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſteemed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpoke of Sir James Macdonald as a young man of moſt diſtinguiſhed merit, who united the higheſt reputation at Eton and Oxford, with the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal ſpirit of a great Highland Chieftain. I mentioned that Sir James had ſaid to me, that he had never ſeen Mr. Johnſon, but he had a great reſpect for him, though at the ſame time it was mixed with ſome degree of terrour. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if he were to be acquainted with me, it might leſſen both."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The mention of this gentleman led us to talk of the Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland, to viſit which he expreſſed a wiſh that then appeared to me a very romantick fancy, which I little thought would be afterwards realized. He told me, that his father had put Martin's account of thoſe iſlands into his hands when he was very young, and that he was highly pleaſed with it; that he was particularly ſtruck with the St. Kilda man's notion that the high church of Glaſgow had been hollowed out of a rock; a circumſtance to which old Mr. Johnſon had directed his attention. He ſaid, he would go to the Hebrides with me, when I returned from my travels, unleſs ſome very good companion ſhould offer when I was abſent, which he did not think probable; adding, <q rend="inline">"There are few people to whom I take ſo much to as you."</q> And when I talked of my leaving England, he ſaid, with a very affectionate air, <q rend="inline">"My dear Boſwell, I ſhould be very unhappy at parting, did I think we were not to meet again."</q>—I cannot too often remind my readers, that although ſuch inſtances of his kindneſs are doubtleſs very flattering to me, yet I hope my recording them will be aſcribed to a better motive than to vanity; for they afford unqueſtionable evidence of his tenderneſs and complacency, which ſome, while they were forced to acknowledge his great powers, have been ſo ſtrenuous to deny.</p>

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0548300101:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He maintained, that a boy at ſchool was the happieſt of human beings. I ſupported a different opinion, from which I have never yet varied, that a man is happier; and I enlarged upon the anxiety and ſufferings which are endured at ſchool. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Ah! Sir, a boy's being flogged is not ſo ſevere as a man's having the hiſs of the world againſt him. Men have a ſolicitude about fame; and the greater ſhare they have of it, the more afraid they are of loſing it."</q> I ſilently aſked myſelf, <q rend="inline">"Is it poſſible that the great Samuel Johnſon really entertains any ſuch apprehenſion, and is not confident that his exalted fame is eſtabliſhed upon a foundation never to be ſhaken?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He this evening drank a bumper to Sir David Dalrymple, as a man of worth, a ſcholar, and a wit.—<q rend="inline">"I have (ſaid he) never heard of him except from you; but let him know my opinion of him: for as he does not ſhew himſelf much in the world, he ſhould have the praiſe of the few who hear of him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, July 26, I found Mr. Johnſon alone. It was a very wet day, and I again complained of the diſagreeable effects of ſuch weather. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, this is all imagination, which phyſicians encourage; for man lives in air, as a fiſh lives in water; ſo that if the atmoſphere preſs heavy from above, there is an equal reſiſtance from below. To be ſure, bad weather is hard upon people who are obliged to be abroad; and men cannot labour ſo well in the open air in bad weather, as in good: but, Sir, a ſmith or a tailor, whoſe work is within doors, will ſurely do as much in rainy weather as in fair. Some very delicate frames, indeed, may be affected by wet weather, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſtitutions."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the education of children; and I aſked him what he thought was beſt to teach them firſt. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is no matter what you teach them firſt, any more than what leg you ſhall put into your breeches firſt. Sir, you may ſtand diſputing which is beſt to put in firſt, but in the mean time your breech is bare. Sir, while you are conſidering which of two things you ſhould teach your child firſt, another boy has learnt them both."</q>

               <p>On Thurſday, July 28, we again ſupped in private at the Turk's Head coffee-houſe. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Swift has a higher reputation than he deſerves.

                  <q rend="inline">"Thomſon, I think, had as much of the poet about him as moſt writers. Every thing appeared to him through the medium of his favourite purſuit. He could not have viewed thoſe two candles burning but with a poetical eye."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Has not—a great deal of wit, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not think ſo, Sir. He is, indeed, continually attempting wit, but he fails. And I have no more pleaſure in hearing a man attempting wit and failing, than in ſeeing a man trying to leap over a ditch and tumbling into it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He laughed heartily, when I mentioned to him a ſaying of his concerning Mr. Thomas Sheridan, which Foote took a wicked pleaſure to circulate. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, Sherry is dull, naturally dull; but it muſt have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now ſee him. Such an exceſs of ſtupidity, Sir, is not in Nature."</q>—<q rend="inline">"So (ſaid he,) I allowed him all his own merit."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He now added, <q rend="inline">"Sheridan cannot bear me. I bring his declamation to a point. I aſk him a plain queſtion, 'What do you mean to teach?' Beſides, Sir, what influence can Mr. Sheridan have upon the language of this great country by his narrow exertions. Sir, it is burning a farthing candle at Dover, to ſhew light at Calais."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of a young man who was uneaſy from thinking that he was very deficient in learning and knowledge, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"A man has no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain who holds a middle place and has many below him; and perhaps he has not ſix of his years above him;—perhaps not one. Though he may not know any thing perfectly, the general maſs of knowledge that he has acquired is conſiderable. Time will do for him all that is wanting."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation then took a philoſophical turn. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Human experience, which is conſtantly contradicting theory, is the great teſt of truth. A ſyſtem, built upon the diſcoveries of a great many minds, is always of more ſtrength, than what is produced by the mere workings of any one mind, which, of itſelf, can do little. There is not ſo poor a book in the world but what would be a prodigious effort were it wrought out entirely by a ſingle mind, without the aid of prior inveſtigators. The French writers are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, becauſe they are not ſcholars, and ſo proceed upon the mere power of their own minds; and we ſee how very little power they have."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"As to the Chriſtian religion, Sir, beſides the ſtrong evidence which we have for it, there is a balance in its favour from the number of great men who have been convinced of its truth, after a ſerious conſideration of the queſtion. Grotius was an acute man, a lawyer, a man accuſtomed to examine
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0548300101:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
evinence, and he was convinced. Grotius was not a recluſe, but a man of the world, who certainly had no bias to the ſide of religion. Sir Iſaac Newton ſet out an infidel, and came to be a very firm believer."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He this evening again recommended to me to perambulate Spain <note n="7" place="bottom">I fully intended to have followed advice of ſuch weight; but having ſtaid much longer both in Germany and Italy than I propoſed to do, and having alſo viſited Corſica, I found that I had exceeded the time allowed me by my father, and haſtened to France in my way homewards.</note>. I ſaid it would amuſe him to get a letter from me dated at Salamancha. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I love the Univerſity of Salamancha; for when the Spaniards were in doubt as to the lawfulneſs of their conquering America, the Univerſity of Salamancha gave it as their opinion that it was not lawful."</q> He ſpoke this with great emotion, and with that generous warmth which dictated the lines in his <q rend="inline">"London,"</q> againſt Spaniſh encroachment.</p>
               <p>I expreſſed my opinion of my friend Derrick as but a poor writer. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure, Sir, he is; but you are to conſider that his being a literary man has got for him all that he has. It has made him King of Bath. Sir, he has nothing to ſay for himſelf but that he is a writer. Had he not been a writer, he muſt have been ſweeping the croſſings in the ſtreets, and aſking halfpence from every body that paſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In juſtice, however, to the memory of Mr. Derrick, who was my firſt tutor in the ways of London, and ſhewed me the town in its variety of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both literary and ſportive, the particulars of which Dr. Johnſon adviſed me to put in writing, it is proper to mention what Johnſon, at a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent period, ſaid of him both as a writer and an editor. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have often ſaid, that if Derrick's letters had been written by one of a more eſtabliſhed name, they would have been thought very pretty letters <note n="8" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 104.</note>."</q> And, <q rend="inline">"I ſent Derrick to Dryden's relations to gather materials for his life; and I believe he got all that I myſelf ſhould have got <note n="9" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 142.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Poor Derrick! I remember him with kindneſs. Yet I cannot with-hold from my readers a pleaſant humourous ſally which could not have hurt him had he been alive, and now is perfectly harmleſs. In his collection of poems, there is one upon entering the harbour of Dublin, his native city, after a long abſence. It begins thus:
<q>
                     <l>"Eblana! much lov'd city, hail!</l>
                     <l>"Where firſt I ſaw the light of day."</l>

 And after a ſolemn reflection on his being <q rend="inline">"numbered with forgotten dead,"</q> there is the following ſtanza:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Unleſs my lines protract my fame,</l>

                     <l>"I knew him! Derrick was his name,</l>
                     <l>"In yonder tomb his aſhes lie."</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>Which was thus happily parodied by Mr. John Home, to whom we owe the beautiful and pathetick tragedy of <q rend="inline">"Douglas:"</q>
               </p>
               <q>

                     <l>"And he who paſſes ſadly ſings,</l>
                     <l>"I knew him! Derrick was his name,</l>
                     <l>"On yonder tree his carcaſe ſwings!"</l>

               </q>
               <p>I doubt much whether the amiable and ingenious authour of theſe burleſque lines will recollect them, for they were produced extempore one evening while he and I were walking together in the dining-room at Eglintoune caſtle, in 1760, and I have never mentioned them to him ſince.</p>
               <p>Johnſon ſaid once to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I honour Derrick for his preſence of mind. One night, when Floyd <note n="1" place="bottom">He publiſhed a biographical work, containing an account of eminent writers, in three vols. 8vo.</note>, another poor authour, was wandering about the ſtreets in the night, he found Derrick faſt aſleep upon a bulk; upon being ſuddenly waked, Derrick ſtarted up, 'My dear Floyd, I am ſorry to ſee you in this deſtitute ſtate; will you go home with me to <hi>my lodgings?"</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I again begged his advice as to my method of ſtudy at Utrecht. <q rend="inline">"Come, (ſaid he) let us make a day of it. Let us go down to Greenwich and dine, and talk of it there."</q> The following Saturday was fixed for this excurſion.</p>
               <p>As we walked along the Strand to-night, arm in arm, a woman of the town accoſted us, in the uſual enticing manner. <q rend="inline">"No, no, my girl, (ſaid Johnſon,) it won't do."</q> He, however, did not treat her with harſhneſs, and we talked of the wretched life of ſuch women; and agreed, that much more miſery than happineſs, upon the whole, is produced by illicit commerce between the ſexes.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, July 30, Dr. Johnſon and I took a ſculler at the Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs, and ſet out for Greenwich. I aſked him if he really thought a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Greek and Latin languages an eſſential requiſite to a good education. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Moſt certainly, Sir. For thoſe who know them have a very great advantage over thoſe who do not. Nay, Sir, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful what a difference learning makes upon people even in the common
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0548300101:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intercourſe of life, which does not appear to be much connected with it."</q>  
                  <q rend="inline">"And yet, (ſaid I) people will go through the world very well, and carry on the buſineſs of life to good advantage, without learning."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that may be true in caſes where learning cannot poſſibly be of any uſe; for inſtance, this boy rows us as well without learning, as if he could ſing the ſong of Orpheus to the Argonauts, who were the firſt ſailors."</q> He then called to the boy, <q rend="inline">"What would you give, my lad, to know about the Argonauts?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid the boy,) I would give what I have."</q> Johnſon was much pleaſed with his anſwer, and we gave him a double fare. Mr. Johnſon then turning to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he) a deſire of knowledge is the natural feeling of mankind; and every human being, whoſe mind is not debauched, will be willing to give all that he has to get knowledge."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We landed at the Old Swan, and walked to Billingſgate, where we took oars, and moved ſmoothly along the ſilver Thames. It was a very fine day. We were entertained with the immenſe number and variety of ſhips that were lying at anchor, and with the beautiful country on each ſide of the river.</p>
               <p>I talked of preaching, and of the great ſucceſs which thoſe called Methodiſts<note n="2" place="bottom">All who are acquainted with the hiſtory of Religion, (the moſt important, ſurely, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the human mind,) know that the appellation of <hi>Methodiſts</hi> was firſt given to a ſociety of ſtudents in the Univerſity of Oxford, who about the year 1730, were diſtinguiſhed by an earneſt and methodical attention to devout exerciſes. This diſpoſition of mind is not a novelty or peculiar to any ſect, but has been, and ſtill may be found, in many Chriſtians of every denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Johnſon himſelf was, in a dignified manner, a Methodiſt. In his Rambler, No. 110, he mentions with reſpect <q rend="inline">"the whole diſcipline of regulated piety;"</q> and in his <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> many inſtances occur of his anxious examination into his ſpiritual ſtate. That this religious earneſtneſs, and in particular an obſervation of the influence of the Holy Spirit, has ſometimes degenerated into folly, and ſometimes been counterfeited for baſe purpoſes, cannot be denied. But it is not, therefore, fair to decry it when genuine. The principal argument in reaſon and good ſenſe againſt methodiſm is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it tends to debaſe human nature, and prevent the generous exertions of goodneſs, by an unworthy ſuppoſition that GOD will pay no regard to them, although it is poſitively ſaid in the ſcriptures that he <q rend="inline">"will reward every man according to his works."</q> But I am happy to have it in my power to do juſtice to thoſe whom it is the faſhion to ridicule, without any knowledge of their tenets; and this I can do by quoting a paſſage from one of their beſt apologiſts, Mr. Milner, who thus expreſſes their doctrine upon this ſubject. <q rend="inline">"Juſtified by faith, renewed in his faculties, and conſtrained by the love of Chriſt, their believer moves in the ſphere of love and gratitude, and all his <hi>duties</hi> flow more or leſs from this principle. And though <hi>they are accumulating for him in heaven a treaſure of bliſs proportioned to his faithfulneſs and activity, and it is by no means inconſiſtent with his principles to feel the force of this conſideration,</hi> yet love itſelf ſweetens every duty to his mind; and he thinks there is no abſurdity in his feeling the love of GOD as the grand commanding principle of his life."</q> 
                     <hi>Eſſays on ſeveral religious Subjects, &amp;c. by Joſeph Milner, A. M. Maſter of the Grammar School of Kingſton-upon-Hull,</hi> 1789<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0548300101:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 and familiar manner, which is the only way to do good to the common people, and which clergymen of genius and learning ought to do from a principle of duty, when it is ſuited to their congregations; a practice, for which they will be praiſed by men of ſenſe. To inſiſt againſt drunkenneſs as a crime, becauſe it debaſes Reaſon, the nobleſt faculty of man, would be of no ſervice to the common people: but to tell them that they may die in a fit of drunkenneſs, and ſhew them how dreadful that would be, cannot fail to make a deep impreſſion. Sir, when your Scotch clergy give up their homely manner, religion will ſoon decay in that country."</q> Let this obſervation, as Johnſon meant it, be ever remembered.</p>
               <p>I was much pleaſed to find myſelf with Johnſon at Greenwich, which he celebrates in his <q rend="inline">"London"</q> as a favourite ſcene. I had the poem in my pocket, and read the lines aloud with enthuſiaſm:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"On Thames's banks in ſilent thought we ſtood,</l>
                     <l>"Where Greenwich ſmiles upon the ſilver flood:</l>
                     <l>"Pleas'd with the ſeat which gave ELIZA birth,</l>
                     <l>"We kneel, and kiſs the conſecrated earth."</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>He remarked that the ſtructure of Greenwich hoſpital was too magnificent for a place of charity, and that its parts were too much detached to make one great whole.</p>
               <p>Buchanan, he ſaid, was a very fine poet; and obſerved, that he was the firſt who complimented a lady, by aſcribing to her the different perfections of the heathen goddeſſes; but that Johnſton improved upon this, by making his lady, at the ſame time, free from their defects.</p>
               <p>He dwelt upon Buchanan's elegant verſes to Mary Queen of Scots, <hi>Nympha Caledoniae,</hi> &amp;c. and ſpoke with enthuſiaſm of the beauty of Latin verſe. <q rend="inline">"All the modern languages (ſaid he) cannot furniſh ſo melodious a line as
<q>
                        <l>'Formoſam reſonare doces Amarillida ſilvas."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards he entered upon the buſineſs of the day, which was to give me his advice as to a courſe of ſtudy. And here I am to mention with much
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0548300101:282" rendition="simple:additions"/>
regret, that my record of what he ſaid is miſerably ſcanty. I recollect with admiration an animating blaze of eloquence, which rouſed every intellectual power in me to the higheſt pitch, but muſt have dazzled me ſo much, that my memory could not preſerve the ſubſtance of his diſcourſe; for the note which I find of it is no more than this:—<q rend="inline">"He ran over the grand ſcale of human knowledge; adviſed me to ſelect ſome particular branch to excel in, but to acquire a little of every kind."</q> The defect of my minutes will be fully ſupplied by a long letter upon the ſubject which he favoured me with, after I had been ſome time at Utrecht, and which my readers will have the pleaſure to peruſe in its proper place.</p>
               <p>We walked in the evening in Greenwich Park. He aſked me, I ſuppoſe by way of trying my diſpoſition, <q rend="inline">"Is not this very fine?"</q> Having no exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite reliſh of the beauties of Nature, and being more delighted with <q rend="inline">"the buſy hum of men,"</q> I anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but not equal to Fleet-ſtreet."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are right, Sir."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am aware that many of my readers may cenſure my want of taſte. Let me, however, ſhelter myſelf under the authority of a very faſhionable Baronet in the brilliant world, who, on his attention being called to the fragrance of a May evening in the country, obſerved, <q rend="inline">"This may be very well; but, for my part, I prefer the ſmell of a flambeau at the play-houſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſtaid ſo long at Greenwich, that our ſail up the river, in our return to London, was by no means ſo pleaſant as in the morning; for the night air was ſo cold that it made me ſhiver. I was the more ſenſible of it from having ſat up all the night before, recollecting and writing in my journal what I thought worthy of preſervation; an exertion, which, during the firſt part of my acquaintance with Johnſon, I frequently made. I remember having ſat up four nights in one week, without being much incommoded in the day time.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, whoſe robuſt frame was not in the leaſt affected by the cold, ſcolded me, as if my ſhivering had been a paltry effeminacy, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Why do you ſhiver?"</q> Sir William Scott, of the Commons, told me, that when he complained of a head-ach in the poſt-chaiſe, as they were travelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Scotland, Johnſon treated him in the ſame manner: <q rend="inline">"At your age, Sir, I had no head-ach."</q> It is not eaſy to make allowance for ſenſations in others, which we ourſelves have not at the time. We muſt all have experienced how very differently we are affected by the complaints of our neighbours, when we are well and when we are ill. In full health, we can ſcarcely believe that they ſuffer much; ſo faint is the image of pain upon our imagination: when ſoftened by ſickneſs, we readily ſympathize with the ſufferings of others.</p>

 We concluded the day at the Turk's Head coffee-houſe very ſocially. He was pleaſed to liſten to a particular account which I gave him of my family, and of its hereditary eſtate, as to the extent and population of which he aſked queſtions, and made calculations; recommending, at the ſame time, a liberal kindneſs to the tenantry, as people over whom the proprietor was placed by Providence. He took delight in hearing my deſcription of the romantick ſeat of my anceſtors. <q rend="inline">"I muſt be there, Sir, (ſaid he) and we will live in the old caſtle; and if there is not a room in it remaining, we will build one."</q> I was highly flattered, but could ſcarcely indulge a hope that Auchinleck would indeed be honoured by his preſence, and celebrated by a deſcription, as it afterwards was, in his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After we had again talked of my ſetting out for Holland, he ſaid <q rend="inline">"I muſt ſee thee out of England: I will accompany you to Harwich."</q> I could not find words to expreſs what I felt upon this unexpected and very great mark of his affectionate regard.</p>
               <p>Next day, Sunday, July 31, I told him I had been that morning at a meeting of the people called Quakers, where I had heard a woman preach. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are ſurprized to find it done at all."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, Auguſt 2, (the day of my departure from London having been fixed for the 5th,) Dr. Johnſon did me the honour to paſs a part of the morning with me at my Chambers. He ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"he always felt an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to do nothing."</q> I obſerved, that it was ſtrange to think that the moſt indolent man in Britain had written the moſt laborious work, THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY.</p>
               <p>I mentioned an imprudent publication, by a certain friend of his, at an early period of life, and aſked him if he thought it would hurt him. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; not much. It may, perhaps, be mentioned at an election."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I had now made good my title to be a privileged man, and was carried by him in the evening to drink tea with Miſs Williams, whom, though under the misfortune of having loſt her ſight, I found to be agreeable in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for ſhe had a variety of literature, and expreſſed herſelf well; but her peculiar value was the intimacy in which ſhe had long lived with Johnſon, by which ſhe was well acquainted with his habits, and knew how to lead him on to talk.</p>
               <p>After tea he carried me to what he called his walk, which was a long narrow paved court in the neighbourhood, overſhadowed by ſome trees. There we ſauntered a conſiderable time; and I complained to him that my love of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0548300101:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
London and of his company was ſuch, that I ſhrunk almoſt from the thought of going away even to travel, which is generally ſo much deſired by young men. He rouſed me by manly and ſpirited converſation. He adviſed me, when ſettled in any place abroad, to ſtudy with an eagerneſs after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to apply to Greek an hour every day; and when I was moving about, to read diligently the great book of mankind.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, Auguſt 3, we had our laſt ſocial evening at the Turk's Head coffee-houſe, before my ſetting out for foreign parts. I had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, before we parted, to irritate him unintentionally. I mentioned to him how common it was in the world to tell abſurd ſtories of him, and to aſcribe to him very ſtrange ſayings. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What do they make me ſay, Sir?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as an inſtance very ſtrange indeed, (laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heartily as I ſpoke,) David Hume told me, you ſaid that you would ſtand before a battery of cannon, to reſtore the Convocation to its full powers."</q>—Little did I apprehend that he had actually ſaid this; but I was ſoon convinced of my errour; for, with a determined look, he thundered out, <q rend="inline">"And would I not, Sir? Shall the Preſbyterian <hi>Kirk</hi> of Scotland have its General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and the Church of England be denied its Convocation?"</q> He was walking up and down the room while I told him the anecdote; but when he uttered this exploſion of high-church zeal, he had come cloſe to my chair, and his eyes flaſhed with indignation. I bowed to the ſtorm, and diverted the force of it, by leading him to expatiate on the influence which religion derived from maintaining the church with great external reſpectability.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit to mention that he this year wrote <q rend="inline">"The Life of Aſcham, †"</q> and the Dedication to the Earl of Shafteſbury, † prefixed to the edition of that writer's Engliſh works, publiſhed by Mr. Bennet.</p>
               <p>On Friday, Auguſt 5, we ſet out early in the morning in the Harwich ſtage coach. A fat elderly gentlewoman, and a young Dutchman, ſeemed the moſt inclined among us to converſation. At the inn where we dined, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſaid that ſhe had done her beſt to educate her children; and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that ſhe had never ſuffered them to be a moment idle. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I wiſh, Madam, you would educate me too; for I have been an idle fellow all my life."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I am ſure, Sir, (ſaid ſhe) you have not been idle."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, it is very true; and that gentleman there (pointing to me,) has been idle. He was idle at Edinburgh. His father ſent him to Glaſgow, where he continued to be idle. He then came to London, where he has been very idle; and now he is going to Utrecht, where he will be as idle as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0548300101:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ever."</q> I aſked him privately how he could expoſe me ſo. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Poh, poh! (ſaid he) they knew nothing about you, and will think of it no more."</q> In the afternoon the gentlewoman talked violently againſt the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and of the horrours of the Inquiſition. To the utter aſtoniſhment of all the paſſengers but myſelf, who knew that he could talk upon any ſide of a queſtion, he defended the Inquiſition, and maintained, that <q rend="inline">"falſe doctrine ſhould be checked on its firſt appearance; that the civil power ſhould unite with the church in puniſhing thoſe who dared to attack the eſtabliſhed religion, and that ſuch only were puniſhed by the Inquiſition."</q> He had in his pocket <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Pomponius Mela de ſitu Orbis,"</hi>
                  </q> in which he read occaſionally, and ſeemed very intent upon ancient geography. Though by no means niggardly, his attention to what was generally right was ſo minute, that having obſerved at one of the ſtages that I oſtentatiouſly gave a ſhilling to the coachman, when the cuſtom was for each paſſenger to give only ſix-pence, he took me aſide and ſcolded me, ſaying that what I had done would make the coachman diſſatisfied with all the reſt of the paſſengers, who gave him no more than his due. This was a juſt reprimand; for in whatever way a man may indulge his generoſity or his vanity in ſpending his money, for the ſake of others he ought not to raiſe the price of any article for which there is a conſtant demand.</p>
               <p>He talked of Mr. Blacklock's poetry, ſo far as it was deſcriptive of viſible objects; and obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"as its authour had the misfortune to be blind, we may be abſolutely ſure that ſuch paſſages are combinations of what he has remembered of the works of other writers who could ſee. That fooliſh fellow Spence has laboured to explain philoſophically how Blacklock may have done, by means of his own faculties, what it is impoſſible he ſhould do. The ſolution, as I have given it, is plain. Suppoſe, I know a man to be ſo lame that he is abſolutely incapable to move himſelf, and I find him in a different room from that in which I left him; ſhall I puzzle myſelf with idle conjectures, that, perhaps, his nerves have by ſome unknown change all at once become effective? No, Sir; it is clear how he got into a different room. He was <hi>carried."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſtopped a night at Colcheſter, Johnſon talked of that town with veneration, for having ſtood a ſiege for Charles the Firſt. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alone now remained with us. He ſpoke Engliſh tolerably well; and thinking to recommend himſelf to us by expatiating on the ſuperiority of the criminal juriſprudence of this country over that of Holland, he inveighed againſt the barbarity of putting an accuſed perſon to the torture, in order to force a confeſſion. But Johnſon was as ready for this, as for the Inquiſition.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0548300101:286" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you do not, I find, underſtand the law of your own country. The torture in Holland is conſidered as a favour to an accuſed perſon; for no man is put to the torture there, unleſs there is as much evidence againſt him as would amount to conviction in England. An accuſed perſon among you, therefore, has one chance more to eſcape puniſhment, than thoſe who are tried among us."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At ſupper this night he talked of good eating with uncommon ſatisfaction. <q rend="inline">"Some people (ſaid he,) have a fooliſh way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very ſtudiouſly, and very carefully; for I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind any thing elſe."</q> He now appeared to me <hi>Jean Bull philoſophe,</hi> and he was, for the moment, not only ſerious but vehement. Yet I have heard him, upon other occaſions, talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates; and the 206th number of his Rambler is a maſterly eſſay againſt guloſity. His practice, indeed, I muſt acknowledge, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as caſting the balance of his different opinions upon this ſubject; for I never knew any man who reliſhed good eating more than he did. When at table, he was totally abſorbed in the buſineſs of the moment; his looks ſeemed rivetted to his plate; nor would he, unleſs when in very high company, ſay one word, or even pay the leaſt attention to what was ſaid by others, till he had ſatisfied his appetite, which was ſo fierce, and indulged with ſuch intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that while in the act of eating, the veins of his forehead ſwelled, and generally a ſtrong perſpiration was viſible. To thoſe whoſe ſenſations were delicate, this could not but be diſguſting; and it was doubtleſs not very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the character of a philoſopher, who ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command. But it muſt be owned, that Johnſon, though he could be rigidly <hi>abſtemious,</hi> was not a <hi>temperate</hi> man either in eating or drinking. He could refrain, but he could not uſe moderately. He told me, that he had faſted two days without inconvenience, and that he had never been hungry but once. They who beheld with wonder how much he eat upon all occaſions when his dinner was to his taſte, could not eaſily conceive what he muſt have meant by hunger; and not only was he remarkable for the extraordinary quantity which he eat, but he was, or affected to be, a man of very nice diſcernment in the ſcience of cookery. He uſed to deſcant critically on the diſhes which had been at table where he had dined or ſupped, and to recollect very minutely what he had liked. I remember, when he was in Scotland, his praiſing <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Gordon's palates,"</hi>
                  </q> (a diſh of palates at the Honourable Alexander Gordon's,) with a warmth of expreſſion which might have done honour to more important
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0548300101:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſubjects. <q rend="inline">"As for—'s imitation of a <hi>made diſh</hi> it was a wretched attempt."</q> He about the ſame time was ſo much diſpleaſed with the performances of a nobleman's French cook, that he exclaimed with vehemence, <q rend="inline">"I'd throw ſuch a raſcal into the river;"</q> and he then proceeded to alarm a lady at whoſe houſe he was to ſup, by the following manifeſto of his ſkill: <q rend="inline">"I, Madam, who live at a variety of good tables, am a much better judge of cookery, than any perſon who has a very tolerable cook, but lives much at home; for his palate is gradually adapted to the taſte of his cook; whereas, Madam, in trying by a wider range, I can more exquiſitely judge."</q> When invited to dine, even with an intimate friend, he was not pleaſed if ſomething better than a plain dinner was not prepared for him. I have heard him ſay on ſuch an occaſion, <q rend="inline">"This was a good dinner enough, to be ſure; but it was not a dinner to <hi>aſk</hi> a man to."</q> On the other hand, he was wont to expreſs, with great glee, his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction when he had been entertained quite to his mind. One day when he had dined with his neighbour and landlord in Bolt-court, Mr. Allen, the printer, whoſe old houſekeeper had ſtudied his taſte in every thing, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this eulogy, <q rend="inline">"Sir, we could not have had a better dinner had there been a <hi>Synod of Cooks."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While we were left by ourſelves, after the Dutchman had gone to bed, Dr. Johnſon talked of that ſtudied behaviour which many have recommended and practiſed. He diſapproved of it; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I never conſidered whether I ſhould be a grave man, or a merry man, but juſt let inclination, for the time, have its courſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He flattered me with ſome hopes that he would, in the courſe of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummer, come over to Holland, and accompany me in a tour through the Netherlands.</p>
               <p>I teized him with fanciful apprehenſions of unhappineſs. A moth having fluttered round the candle, and burnt itſelf, he laid hold of this little inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to admoniſh me; ſaying, with a ſly look, and in a ſolemn but quiet tone, <q rend="inline">"That creature was its own tormentor, and I believe its name was BOSWELL."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next day we got to Harwich to dinner; and my paſſage in the packet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat to Helvoetſluys being ſecured, and my baggage put on board, we dined at our inn by ourſelves. I happened to ſay it would be terrible if he ſhould not find a ſpeedy opportunity of returning to London, and be confined to ſo dull a place. JOHNSON<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Don't, Sir, accuſtom yourſelf to uſe big words for little matters. It would <hi>not</hi> be <hi>terrible,</hi> though I <hi>were</hi> to be detained ſome time here."</q> The practice of uſing words of diſproportionate magnitude,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0548300101:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tude, is, no doubt, too frequent every where; but, I think, moſt remarkable  among the French, of which, all who have travelled in France muſt have been ſtruck with innumerable inſtances.</p>
               <p>We went and looked at the church, and having gone into it and walked up to the altar, Johnſon, whoſe piety was conſtant and fervent, ſent me to my knees, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Now that you are going to leave your native country, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend yourſelf to the protection of your Creator and Redeemer."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After we came out of the church, we ſtood talking for ſome time together of Biſhop Berkeley's ingenious ſophiſtry to prove the non-exiſtence of matter, and that every thing in the univerſe is merely ideal. I obſerved, that though we are ſatisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impoſſible to refute it. I never ſhall forget the alacrity with which Johnſon anſwered, ſtriking his foot with mighty force againſt a large ſtone, till he rebounded from it, <q rend="inline">"I refute it <hi>thus."</hi>
                  </q> This was a ſtout exemplification of the <hi>firſt truths</hi> of <hi>Pere Bouffier,</hi> or the <hi>original principles</hi> of Reid and of Beattie; without admitting which, we can no more argue in metaphyſicks, than we can argue in mathematicks without axioms. To me it is not conceivable how Berkeley can be anſwered by pure reaſoning. But I know that the nice and difficult taſk was to have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by one of the moſt luminous minds of the preſent age; had not politicks <q rend="inline">"turned him from calm philoſophy aſide."</q> What an admirable diſplay of ſubtilty, united with brilliance, might his contending with Berkeley have afforded us! How muſt we, when we reflect on the loſs of ſuch an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual feaſt, regret that he ſhould be characteriſed as the man,
<q>
                     <l>"Who born for the univerſe narrowed his mind,</l>
                     <l>"And to party gave up what was meant for mankind?"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>My revered friend walked down with me to the beach, where we embraced and parted with tenderneſs, and engaged to correſpond by letters. I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I hope, Sir, you will not forget me in my abſence."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is more likely you ſhould forget me, than that I ſhould forget you."</q> As the veſſel put out to ſea, I kept my eyes upon him for a conſiderable time, while he remained rolling his majeſtick frame in his uſual manner; at laſt I perceived him walk back into the town, and he diſappeared.</p>
               <p>Utrecht ſeeming at firſt very dull to me, after the animated ſcenes of London, my ſpirits were grievouſly affected; and I wrote to Johnſon a plaintive and deſponding letter, to which he paid no regard. Afterwards, when I had acquired a firmer tone of mind, I wrote him a ſecond letter,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0548300101:289"/>
 expreſſing much anxiety to hear from him. At length I received the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing epiſtle, which was of important ſervice to me, and, I truſt, will be ſo alſo to many others.</p>

                        <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU are not to think yourſelf forgotten, or criminally neglected, that you have had yet no letter from me. I love to ſee my friends, to hear from them, to talk to them, and to talk of them; but it is not without a conſiderable effort of reſolution that I prevail upon myſelf to write. I would not, however, gratify my own indolence by the omiſſion of any important duty, or any office of real kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>To tell you that I am or am not well, that I have or have not been in the country, that I drank your health in the room in which we ſat laſt together, and that your acquaintance continue to ſpeak of you with their former kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, topicks with which thoſe letters are commonly filled which are written only for the ſake of writing, I ſeldom ſhall think worth communicating; but if I can have it in my power to calm any harraſſing diſquiet, to excite any virtuous deſire, to rectify any important opinion, or fortify any generous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, you need not doubt but I ſhall at leaſt wiſh to prefer the pleaſure of gratifying a friend much leſs eſteemed than yourſelf, before the gloomy calm of idle vacancy. Whether I ſhall eaſily arrive at an exact punctuality of correſpondence, I cannot tell. I ſhall, at preſent, expect that you will receive this in return for two which I have had from you. The firſt, indeed, gave me an account ſo hopeleſs of the ſtate of your mind, that it hardly admitted or deſerved an anſwer; by the ſecond I was much better pleaſed: and the pleaſure will ſtill be increaſed by ſuch a narrative of the progreſs of your ſtudies, as may evince the continuance of an equal and rational application of your mind to ſome uſeful enquiry.</p>
                     <p>You will, perhaps, wiſh to aſk, what ſtudy I would recommend. I ſhall not ſpeak of theology, becauſe it ought not to be conſidered as a queſtion whether you ſhall endeavour to know the will of GOD.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall, therefore, conſider only ſuch ſtudies as we are at liberty to purſue or to neglect; and of theſe I know not how you will make a better choice, than by ſtudying the civil law, as your father adviſes, and the ancient languages, as you had determined for yourſelf; at leaſt reſolve, while you remain in any

ſettled reſidence, to ſpend a certain number of hours every day amongſt your books. The diſſipation of thought, of which you complain, is nothing more than the vacillation of a mind ſuſpended between different motives, and changing its direction as any motive gains or loſes ſtrength. If you can but kindle in your mind any ſtrong deſire, if you can but keep predominant any wiſh for ſome particular excellence or attainment, the guſts of imagination will break away, without any effect upon your conduct, and commonly without any traces left upon the memory.</p>
                     <p>There lurks, perhaps, in every human heart a deſire of diſtinction, which inclines every man firſt to hope, and then to believe, that Nature has given him ſomething peculiar to himſelf. This vanity makes one mind nurſe averſions, and another actuate deſires, till they riſe by art much above their original ſtate of power; and as affectation, in time, improves to habit, they at laſt tyranniſe over him who at firſt encouraged them only for ſhow. Every deſire is a viper in the boſom, who, while he was chill, was harmleſs; but when warmth gave him ſtrength, exerted it in poiſon. You know a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, when firſt he ſet his foot in the gay world, as he prepared himſelf to whirl in the vortex of pleaſure, imagined a total indifference and univerſal negligence to be the moſt agreeable concomitants of youth, and the ſtrongeſt indication of an airy temper and a quick apprehenſion. Vacant to every object, and ſenſible of every impulſe, he thought that all appearance of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence would deduct ſomething from the reputation of genius; and hoped that he ſhould appear to attain, amidſt all the eaſe of careleſſneſs and all the tumult of diverſion, that knowledge and thoſe accompliſhments which mortals of the common fabrick obtain only by mute abſtraction and ſolitary drudgery. He tried this ſcheme of life awhile, was made weary of it by his ſenſe and his virtue, he then wiſhed to return to his ſtudies; and finding long habits of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure harder to be cured than he expected, ſtill willing to retain his claim to ſome extraordinary prerogatives, reſolved the common conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of irregularity into an unalterable decree of deſtiny, and concluded that Nature had originally formed him incapable of rational employment.</p>
                     <p>Let all ſuch fancies, illuſive and deſtructive, be baniſhed henceforward from your thoughts for ever. Reſolve, and keep your reſolution; chooſe, and purſue your choice. If you ſpend this day in ſtudy, you will find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtill more able to ſtudy to-morrow; not that you are to expect that you ſhall at once obtain a complete victory. Depravity is not very eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Reſolution will ſometimes relax, and diligence will ſometimes be interrupted; but let no accidental ſurprize or deviation, whether ſhort or long,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0548300101:291"/>
 diſpoſe you to deſpondency. Conſider theſe failings as incident to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Begin again where you left off, and endeavour to avoid the ſeducements that prevailed over you before.</p>
                     <p>This, my dear Boſwell, is advice which, perhaps, has been often given you, and given you without effect. But this advice, if you will not take from others, you muſt take from your own reflections, if you purpoſe to do the duties of the ſtation to which the bounty of Providence has called you.</p>
                     <p>Let me have a long letter from you as ſoon as you can. I hope you continue your journal, and enrich it with many obſervations upon the country in which you reſide. It will be a favour if you can get me any books in the Friſick language, and can enquire how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"I have made all poſſible enquiry with reſpect to the Friſick language, and find that it has been leſs cultivated than any other of the northern dialects; a certain proof of which is their deficiency of books. Of the old Friſick there are no remains, except ſome ancient laws preſerved by <hi>Schotanus</hi> in his <hi>'Beſchryvinge van die Heerlykheid van Frieſland;'</hi> and his <hi>'Hiſtoria Friſica.'</hi> I have not yet been able to find theſe books. Profeſſor Trotz, who formerly was of the Univerſity of Vranyken, in Frieſland, and is at preſent preparing an edition of all the Friſick laws, gave me this information. Of the modern Friſick, or what is ſpoken by the boors at this day, I have procured a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It is <hi>'Giſbert Japix's Rymelerie,'</hi> which is the only book that they have. It is amazing, that they have no tranſlation of the bible, no treatiſes of devotion, nor even any of the ballads and ſtory-books which are ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to country people.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1764"/> Early in 1764 Johnſon paid a viſit to the Langton family, at their ſeat of Langton, in Lincolnſhire, where he paſſed ſome time, much to his ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His friend Bennet Langton, it will not be doubted, did every thing in his power to make the place agreeable to ſo illuſtrious a gueſt; and the elder
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0548300101:292"/>
Mr. Langton and his lady, being fully capable of underſtanding his value, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1764. Aetat. 55."/> were not wanting in attention. He, however, told me, that old Mr. Langton, though a man of conſiderable learning, had ſo little allowance to make for his occaſional <q rend="inline">"laxity of talk,"</q> that becauſe in the courſe of diſcuſſion he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mentioned what might be ſaid in favour of the peculiar tenets of the Romiſh church, he went to his grave believing him to be of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, during his ſtay at Langton, had the advantage of a good library, and ſaw ſeveral gentlemen of the neighbourhood. I have obtained from Mr. Langton the following particulars of this period.</p>
               <p>He was now fully convinced that he could not have been ſatisfied with a country living; for, talking of a reſpectable clergyman in Lincolnſhire, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"This man, Sir, fills up the duties of his life well. I approve of him, but could not imitate him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>To a lady who endeavoured to vindicate herſelf from blame for neglecting ſocial attention to worthy neighbours, by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I would go to them if it would do them any good;"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What good, Madam, do you expect to have in your power to do them? It is ſhewing them reſpect, and that is doing them good."</q>
               </p>
               <p>So ſocially accommodating was he, that once when Mr. Langton and he were driving together in a coach, and Mr. Langton complained of being ſick, he inſiſted that they ſhould go out, and ſit on the back of it in the open air, which they did. And being ſenſible how ſtrange the appearance muſt be, obſerved, that a countryman whom they ſaw in a field would probably be thinking, <q rend="inline">"If theſe two madmen ſhould come down, what would become of me?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after his return to London, which was in February, was founded that club which exiſted long without a name, but at Mr. Garrick's funeral became diſtinguiſhed by the title of THE LITERARY CLUB. Sir Joſhua Reynolds had the merit of being the firſt propoſer of it, to which Johnſon acceded, and the original members were, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Dr. Johnſon, Mr. Edmund Burke, Dr. Nugent, Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Dr. Goldſmith, Mr. Chamier, and Sir John Hawkins. They met at the Turk's Head, in Gerard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, Soho, one evening in every week, at ſeven, and generally continued their converſation till a pretty late hour. This club has been gradually increaſed, and inſtead of aſſembling in the evening, they now dine together at a tavern in Dover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, once a fortnight, during the meeting of Parliament.

               <p>Sir John Hawkins<note n="3" place="bottom">Life of Johnſon, p. 425.</note> repreſents himſelf as a <q rend="inline">

                  </q> himſelf from it, that its late hours were inconſiſtent with his domeſtick arrangements. In this he is not accurate; for the fact was, that he one evening attacked Mr. Burke in ſo rude a manner, that all the company teſtified their diſpleaſure; and at their next meeting his reception was ſuch, that he never came again <note n="4" place="bottom">From Sir Joſhua Reynolds.</note>.</p>
               <p>He is equally inaccurate with reſpect to Mr. Garrick, of whom he ſays, <q rend="inline">"he truſted that the leaſt intimation of a deſire to come among us, would procure him a ready admiſſion; but in this he was miſtaken. Johnſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted me upon it; and when I could find no objection to receiving him, exclaimed,—'He will diſturb us by his buffoonery;'—and afterwards ſo managed matters, that he was never formally propoſed, and, by conſequence, never admitted <note n="5" place="bottom">Life of Johnſon, p. 425.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In juſtice both to Mr. Garrick and Dr. Johnſon, I think it neceſſary to rectify this miſ-ſtatement. The truth is, that not very long after the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our club, Sir Joſhua Reynolds was ſpeaking of it to Garrick. <q rend="inline">"I like it much, (ſaid he,) I think I ſhall be of you."</q> When Sir Joſhua men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this to Dr. Johnſon, he was much diſpleaſed with the actor's conceit. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"He'll be of us,</hi> (ſaid Johnſon,) how does he know we will <hi>permit</hi> him? The firſt duke in England has no right to hold ſuch language."</q> However, when Garrick was regularly propoſed ſome time afterwards, Johnſon, though he had taken a momentary offence at his arrogance, warmly and kindly ſupported him, and he was accordingly elected, was a moſt agreeable member, and continued to attend our meetings to the time of his death.</p>

               <p>I am happy to be enabled by ſuch unqueſtionable authority as that of Sir Joſhua Reynolds, as well as from my own knowledge, to vindicate at once the heart of Johnſon and the ſocial merit of Garrick.</p>
               <p>In this year, except what he may have done in reviſing Shakſpeare, we do not find that he laboured much in literature. He wrote a review of Grainger's <q rend="inline">"Sugar Cane, a Poem,"</q> in the London Chronicle. He told me, that Dr. Percy wrote the greateſt part of this review; but, I imagine, he did not recollect it diſtinctly, for it appears to be moſtly, if not altogether, his own. He alſo wrote in the Critical Review, an account† of Goldſmith's excellent poem, <q rend="inline">"The Traveller."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The eaſe and independence to which he had at laſt attained by royal muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, increaſed his natural indolence. In his <q rend="inline">"Meditations"</q> he thus accuſes himſelf: <q rend="inline">"GOOD FRIDAY, April 20, 1764. I have made no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I have lived totally uſeleſs, more ſenſual in thought, and more addicted to wine and meat <note n="7" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 50.</note>."</q> And next morning he thus feelingly complains: <q rend="inline">"My indolence, ſince my laſt reception of the ſacrament, has ſunk into groſſer ſluggiſhneſs, and my diſſipation ſpread into wilder negligence. My thoughts have been clouded with ſenſuality; and, except that from the beginning of this year I have, in ſome meaſure, forborne exceſs of ſtrong drink, my appetites have predominated over my reaſon. A kind of ſtrange oblivion has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread me, ſo that I know not what has become of the laſt year; and perceive that incidents and intelligence paſs over me, without leaving any impreſſion."</q> He then ſolemnly ſays, <q rend="inline">"This is not the life to which heaven is promiſed <note n="8" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 51.</note>;"</q> and he earneſtly reſolves on amendment.</p>
               <p>It was his cuſtom to obſerve certain days with a pious abſtraction; viz. New-year's-day, the day of his wiſe's death, Good Friday, Eaſter-day, and his own birth-day. He this year ſays, <q rend="inline">"I have now ſpent fifty-five years in reſolving; having, from the earlieſt time almoſt that I can remember, been forming ſchemes of a better life. I have done nothing. The need of doing, therefore, is preſſing, ſince the time of doing is ſhort. O GOD, grant me to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0548300101:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 reſolve aright, and to keep my reſolutions, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake. Amen <note n="9" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 58.</note>."</q> Such a tenderneſs of conſcience, ſuch a fervent deſire of improvement, will rarely be found. It is, ſurely, not decent in thoſe who are hardened in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſpiritual improvement, to treat this pious anxiety of Johnſon with contempt.</p>
               <p>About this time he was afflicted with a very ſevere return of the hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack diſorder, which was ever lurking about him. He was ſo ill, as, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his remarkable love of company, to be entirely averſe to ſociety, the moſt fatal ſymptom of that malady. Dr. Adams told me, that, as an old friend, he was admitted to viſit him, and that he found him in a deplorable ſtate, ſighing, groaning, talking to himſelf, and reſtleſsly walking from room to room. He then uſed this emphatical expreſſion of the miſery which he felt: <q rend="inline">"I would conſent to have a limb amputated to recover my ſpirits."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking to himſelf was, indeed, one of his ſingularities ever ſince I knew him. I was certain that he was frequently uttering pious ejaculations, for fragments of the Lord's Prayer have been diſtinctly overheard. His friend Mr. Thomas Davies, of whom Churchill ſays,
<q>
                     <l>"That Davies hath a very pretty wife:"</l>
                  </q>
when Dr. Johnſon muttered <q rend="inline">"lead us not into temptation,"</q> uſed with wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and gallant humour to whiſper Mrs. Davies, <q rend="inline">"You, my dear, are the cauſe of this."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had another particularity, of which none of his friends ever ventured to aſk an explanation. It appeared to me ſome ſuperſtitious habit, which he had contracted early, and from which he had never called upon his reaſon to diſ-entangle him. This was his anxious care to go out or in at a door or paſſage, by a certain number of ſteps from a certain point, or at leaſt ſo as that either his right or his left foot, (I am not certain which,) ſhould conſtantly make the firſt actual movement when he came cloſe to the door or paſſage. Thus I conjecture: for I have, upon innumerable occaſions, obſerved him ſuddenly ſtop, and then ſeem to count his ſteps with a deep earneſtneſs; and when he had neglected or gone wrong in this ſort of magical movement, I have ſeen him go back again, put himſelf in a proper poſture to begin the ceremony, and, having gone through it, break from his abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, walk briſkly on, and join his companion. A ſtrange inſtance of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature, even when on horſeback, happened when he was in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0548300101:296" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iſle of Sky <note n="1" place="bottom">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 316.</note>. Sir Joſhua Reynolds has obſerved him to go a good way about,  rather than croſs a particular alley in Leiceſter-fields; but this Sir Joſhua imputed to his having had ſome diſagreeable recollection aſſociated with it.</p>
               <p>That the moſt minute ſingularities which belonged to him, and made very obſervable parts of his appearance and manner, may not be omitted, it is requiſite to mention, that while talking or even muſing as he ſat in his chair, he commonly ſhook his head in a tremulous manner, moving his body back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the ſame direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various ſounds with his mouth, ſometimes as if ruminating, or what is called chewing the cud, ſometimes giving a half whiſtle, ſometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding it againſt his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, <hi>too, too, too:</hi> all this accompanied ſometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a ſmile.</p>
               <p>I am fully aware how very obvious an occaſion I here give for the ſneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jocularity of ſuch as have no reliſh of an exact likeneſs; which, to render complete, he who draws it muſt not diſdain the ſlighteſt ſtrokes. But if witlings ſhould be inclined to attack this account, let them have the candour to quote what I have offered in my defence.</p>
               <p>He was for ſome time in the ſummer at Eaſton Maudit, Northamptonſhire, on a viſit to the Reverend Dr. Percy, now Biſhop of Dromore. Whatever diſſatisfaction he felt at what he conſidered as a ſlow progreſs in intellectual improvement, we find that his heart was tender, and his affections warm, as appears from the following very kind letter:

There is a lively pictureſque account of his behaviour on this viſit, in the Gentleman's Magazine for March 1785, being an extract of a letter from the late Dr. John Sharp.

I go with you, Sir, as far as the ſtreet-door."</q> In what particular department he intended to engage does not appear, nor can Mr. Hamilton explain.

               <p>This year was diſtinguiſhed by his being introduced into the family of Mr. Thrale, one of the moſt eminent brewers in England, and Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the borough of Southwark. Foreigners are not a little amazed when they hear of brewers, diſtillers, and men in ſimilar departments of trade, held forth as perſons of conſiderable conſequence. In this great commercial country it is natural that a ſituation which produces much wealth ſhould be conſidered as very reſpectable; and, no doubt, honeſt induſtry is entitled to eſteem. But, perhaps, the too rapid advance of men of low extraction tends to leſſen the value of that diſtinction by birth and gentility, which has ever been found beneficial to the grand ſcheme of ſubordination. Johnſon uſed to give this account of the riſe of Mr. Thrale's father: <q rend="inline">"He worked at ſix ſhillings a week for twenty years in the great brewery, which afterwards was his own. The proprietor of it had an only daughter, who was married to a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0548300101:299" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 nobleman. It was not fit that a peer ſhould continue the buſineſs. On the old man's death, therefore, the brewery was to be ſold. To find a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer for ſo large a property was a difficult matter; and, after ſome time, it was ſuggeſted, that it would be adviſeable to treat with Thrale, a ſenſible, active, honeſt man, who had been long employed in the houſe, and to transfer the whole to him for thirty thouſand pounds, ſecurity being taken upon the property. This was accordingly ſettled. In eleven years Thrale paid the purchaſe-money. He acquired a large fortune, and lived to be Member of Parliament for Southwark. But what was moſt remarkable was the liberality with which he uſed his riches. He gave his ſon and daughters the beſt education. The eſteem which his good conduct procured him from the nobleman who had married his maſter's daughter, made him be treated with much attention; and his ſon, both at ſchool and at the Univerſity of Oxford, aſſociated with young men of the firſt rank. His allowance from his father, after he left college, was ſplendid; no leſs than a thouſand a year. This, in a man who had riſen as old Thrale did, was a very extraordinary inſtance of generoſity. He uſed to ſay, 'If this young dog does not find ſo much after I am gone as he expects, let him remember that he has had a great deal in my own time."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſon, though in affluent circumſtances, had good ſenſe enough to carry on his father's trade, which was of ſuch extent, that I remember he once told me, he would not quit it for an annuity of ten thouſand a year; <q rend="inline">"Not (ſaid he,) that I get ten thouſand a year by it, but it is an eſtate to a family."</q> Having left daughters only, the property was ſold for the immenſe ſum of one hundred and thirty thouſand pounds; a magnificent proof of what may be done by fair trade in no long period of time.</p>
               <p>There may be ſome who think that a new ſyſtem of gentility might be eſtabliſhed, upon principles totally different from what have hitherto prevailed. Our preſent heraldry, it may be ſaid, is ſuited to the barbarous times in which it had its origin. It is chiefly founded upon ferocious merit, upon military excellence. Why, in civiliſed times, we may be aſked, ſhould there not be rank and honours, upon principles, which, independent of long cuſtom, are certainly not leſs worthy, and which, when once allowed to be connected with elevation and precedency, would obtain the ſame dignity in our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Why ſhould not the knowledge, the ſkill, the expertneſs, the aſſiduity, and the ſpirited hazards of trade and commerce, when crowned with ſucceſs, be entitled to give thoſe flattering diſtinctions by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are ſo univerſally captivated</p>

Such are the ſpecious, but falſe arguments for a propoſition which always will find numerous advocates, in a nation where men are every day ſtarting up from obſcurity to wealth. To refute them is needleſs. The general ſenſe of mankind cries out, with irreſiſtible force, <q rend="inline">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Thrale had married Miſs Heſther Lynch Saluſbury, of good Welch extraction, a lady of lively talents, improved by education. That Johnſon's introduction into Mr. Thrale's family, which contributed ſo much to the happineſs of his life, was owing to her deſire for his converſation, is the moſt probable and general ſuppoſition. But it is not the truth. Mr. Murphy, who was intimate with Mr. Thrale, having ſpoken very highly of Dr. Johnſon, he was requeſted to make them acquainted. This being mentioned to Johnſon, he accepted of an invitation to dinner at Thrale's, and was ſo much pleaſed with his reception, both by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, and they ſo much pleaſed with him, that his invitations to their houſe were more and more frequent, till at laſt he became one of the family, and an apartment was appropriated to him, both in their houſe in Southwark, and in their villa at Streatham.</p>
               <p>Johnſon had a very ſincere eſteem for Mr. Thrale as a man of excellent principles, a good ſcholar, well ſkilled in trade, of a ſound underſtanding, and of manners ſuch as preſented the character of a plain independent Engliſh 'Squire. As this family will frequently be mentioned in the courſe of the following pages, and as a falſe notion has prevailed that Mr. Thrale was inferiour, and in ſome degree inſignificant, compared with Mrs. Thrale, it may be proper to give a true ſtate of the caſe from the authority of Johnſon himſelf, in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I know no man (ſaid he,) who is more maſter of his wife and family than Thrale. If he but holds up a finger, he is obeyed. It is a great miſtake to ſuppoſe that ſhe is above him in literary attainments. She is more flippant; but he has ten times her learning: he is a regular ſcholar; but her learning is that of a ſchool-boy in one of the lower forms."</q> My readers may naturally wiſh for ſome repreſentation of the figures of this couple. Mr. Thrale was tall, well proportioned, and ſtately. As for <hi>Madam,</hi> or <hi>my Miſtreſs,</hi> by which epithets Johnſon uſed to mention Mrs. Thrale, ſhe was ſhort, plump, and briſk. She has herſelf given us a lively view of the idea which Johnſon had of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on her appearing before him in a dark-coloured gown: <q rend="inline">"You little creatures ſhould never wear thoſe ſort of clothes, however; they are unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0548300101:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 in every way. What! have not all inſects gay colours <note n="6" place="bottom">Mrs. Piozzi's Anecdotes, p. 279.</note>?"</q> Mr. Thrale gave his wife a liberal indulgence, both in the choice of their company, and in the mode of entertaining them. He underſtood and valued Johnſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion, from their firſt acquaintance to the day of his death. Mrs. Thrale was enchanted with Johnſon's converſation for its own ſake, and had alſo a very allowable vanity in appearing to be honoured with the attention of ſo celebrated a man.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be more fortunate for Johnſon than this connection. He had at Mr. Thrale's all the comforts and even luxuries of life; his melancholy was diverted, and his irregular habits leſſened by aſſociation with an agreeable and well-ordered family. He was treated with the utmoſt reſpect, and even affection. The vivacity of Mrs. Thrale's literary talk rouſed him to cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and exertion, even when they were alone. But this was not often the caſe; for he found here a conſtant ſucceſſion of what gave him the higheſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſociety of the learned, the witty, and the eminent in every way, who were aſſembled in numerous companies, called forth his wonderful powers, and gratified him with admiration, to which no man could be inſenſible.</p>
               <p>In the October of this year he at length gave to the world his edition of Shakſpeare, which, if it had no other merit but that of producing his Preface, in which the excellencies and defects of that immortal bard are diſplayed with a maſterly hand, the nation would have had no reaſon to complain. A blind indiſcriminate admiration of Shakſpeare had expoſed the Britiſh nation to the ridicule of foreigners. Johnſon, by candidly admitting the faults of his poet, had the more credit in beſtowing on him deſerved and indiſputable praiſe; and doubtleſs none of all his panegyriſts have done him half ſo much honour. Their praiſe was, like that of a counſel, upon his own ſide of the cauſe: Johnſon's was like' the grave, well conſidered, and impartial opinion of the judge, which falls from his lips with weight, and is received with reverence. What he did as a commentator has no ſmall ſhare of merit, though his reſearches were not ſo ample, and his inveſtigations ſo acute as they might have been, which we now certainly know from the labours of other able and ingenious criticks who have followed him. He has enriched his edition with a conciſe account of each play, and of its characteriſtick excellence. Many of his notes have illuſtrated obſcurities in the text, and placed paſſages eminent for beauty in a more conſpicuous light; and he has, in general, exhibited ſuch a mode of annotation, as may be beneficial to all ſubſequent editors.</p>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0548300101:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His Shakſpeare was virulently attacked by Mr. William Kenrick, who obtained the degree of LL. D. from a Scotch Univerſity, and wrote for the bookſellers in a great variety of branches. Though he certainly was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſiderable merit, he wrote with ſo little regard to principle and decorum, and in ſo haſty a manner, that his reputation was neither extenſive nor laſting. I remember one evening, when ſome of his works were mentioned, Dr. Goldſmith ſaid, he had never heard' of them; upon which Dr. Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is one of the many who have made themſelves <hi>publick,</hi> without making themſelves <hi>known."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A young ſtudent of Oxford, of the name of Barclay, wrote an anſwer to Kenrick's review of Johnſon's Shakſpeare. Johnſon was at firſt angry that Kenrick's attack ſhould have the credit of an anſwer. But afterwards, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the young man's good intention, he kindly noticed him, and probably would have done more, had not the young man died.</p>
               <p>In his Preface to Shakſpeare, Johnſon treated Voltaire very contemptuouſly, obſerving, upon ſome of his remarks, <q rend="inline">"Theſe are the petty criticiſms of petty wits."</q> Voltaire, in revenge, made an attack upon Johnſon, in one of his numerous literary ſallies, which I remember to have read; but there being no general index to his voluminous works, have ſearched for it in vain, and therefore cannot quote it.</p>
               <p>Voltaire was an antagoniſt with whom I thought Johnſon ſhould not diſdain to contend. I preſſed him to anſwer. He ſaid, he perhaps might: but he never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burney having occaſion to write to Johnſon for ſome receipts for ſubſcriptions to his Shakſpeare, which Johnſon had omitted to deliver, when the money was paid, he availed himſelf of that opportunity of thanking Johnſon for the great pleaſure which he had received from the peruſal of his Preface to Shakſpeare; which although it excited much clamour againſt him at firſt, is now juſtly ranked among the moſt excellent of his writings. To this letter, Johnſon returned the following anſwer:

               <p>This unſolicited mark of diſtinction, conferred on ſo great a literary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, did much honour to the judgement and liberal ſpirit of that learned body. Johnſon acknowledged the favour in a letter to Dr. Leland, one of their number; but I have not been able to obtain a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Both in 1764 and 1765 it ſhould ſeem that he was ſo buſily employed with his edition of Shakſpeare, as to have had little leiſure for any other literary exertion, or, indeed, even for private correſpondence. He did not favour me with a ſingle letter for more than two years, for which it will appear that he afterwards apologiſed.</p>
               <p>He was, however, at all times ready to give aſſiſtance to his friends, and others, in reviſing their works, and in writing for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or greatly improving their Dedications. In that courtly ſpecies of compoſition no man excelled Dr. Johnſon. Though the loftineſs of his mind prevented him from ever dedicating in his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>perſon, he wrote a very great number of Dedications
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0548300101:304" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for others. Some of theſe, the perſons who were favoured with them are unwilling ſhould be mentioned, from a too anxious apprehenſion, as I think, that they might be ſuſpected of having received larger aſſiſtance; and ſome, after all the diligence I have beſtowed, have eſcaped my inquiries. He told me, a great many years ago, <q rend="inline">"he believed he had dedicated to all the Royal Family round;''</q> and it was indifferent to him what was the ſubject of the work dedicated, provided it were innocent. He once dedicated ſome Muſick for the German Flute to Edward Duke of York. In writing Dedications for others, he conſidered himſelf as by no means ſpeaking his own ſentiments.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his long ſilence, I never omitted to write to him when I had any thing worthy of communicating. I generally kept copies of my letters to him, that I might have a full view of our correſpondence, and never be at a loſs to underſtand any reference in his letters. He kept the greater part of mine very carefully; and a ſhort time before his death was attentive enough to ſeal them up in bundles, and order them to be delivered to me, which was accordingly done. Amongſt them I found one, of which I had not made a copy, and which I own I read with pleaſure at the diſtance of almoſt twenty years. It is dated November, 1765, at the palace of Paſcal Paoli, in Corte, the capital of Corſica, and is full of generous enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. After giving a ſketch of what I had ſeen and heard in that iſland, it proceeded thus: <q rend="inline">"I dare to call this a ſpirited tour. I dare to challenge your approbation."</q>

                     <p>APOLOGIES are ſeldom of any uſe. We will delay till your arrival the reaſons, good or bad, which have made me ſuch a ſparing and ungrateful correſpondent. Be aſſured, for the preſent, that nothing has leſſened either the eſteem or love with which I diſmiſſed you at Harwich. Both have been increaſed by all that I have been told of you by yourſelf or others; and when you return, you will return to an unaltered, and, I hope, unalterable friend.</p>
                     <p>All that you have to fear from me is the vexation of diſappointing me. No man loves to fruſtrate expectations which have been formed in his favour; and the pleaſure which I promiſe myſelf from your journals and remarks is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0548300101:305"/>
 ſo great, that perhaps no degree of attention or discernment will be ſufficient to afford it.</p>
                     <p>Come home, however, and take your chance. I long to ſee you, and to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hear you; and hope that we ſhall not be ſo long ſeparated again. Come home, and expect ſuch a welcome as is due to him, whom a wiſe and noble curioſity has led, where perhaps no native of this country ever was before.</p>
                     <p>I have no news to tell you that can deſerve your notice; nor would I willingly leſſen the pleaſure that any novelty may give you at your return. I am afraid we ſhall find it difficult to keep among us a mind which has been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long feaſted with variety. But let us try what eſteem and kindneſs can effect.</p>
                     <p>As your father's liberality has indulged you with ſo long a ramble, I doubt not but you will think his ſickneſs, or even his deſire to ſee you, a ſufficient reaſon for haſtening your return. The longer we live, and the more we think, the higher value we learn to put on the friendſhip and tenderneſs of parents and of friends. Parents we can have but once; and he promiſes himſelf too much, who enters life with the expectation of finding many friends. Upon ſome motive, I hope, that you will be here ſoon; and am willing to think that it will be an inducement to your return, that it is ſincerely deſired by,</p>

               <p>I returned to London in February, and found Dr. Johnſon in a good houſe in Johnſon's-court, Fleet-ſtreet, in which he had accommodated Miſs Williams with an apartment on the ground floor, while Mr. Levett occupied his poſt in the garret: his faithful Francis was ſtill attending upon him. He received me with much kindneſs. The fragments of our firſt converſation, which I have preſerved, are theſe: I told him that Voltaire, in a converſation with me, had diſtinguiſhed Pope and Dryden thus:—<q rend="inline">"Pope drives a handſome chariot, with a couple of neat trim nags; Dryden a coach, and ſix ſtately horſes."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the truth is, they both drive coaches and ſix; but Dryden's horſes are either galloping or ſtumbling: Pope's go at a ſteady even trot <note n="7" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is remarkable, that Mr. Gray has employed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſomewhat the ſame image to characteriſe Dryden. He, indeed, furniſhes his car with but two horſes; but they are of ethereal race:</p>

He ſaid of Goldſmith's Traveller, which had been publiſhed in my abſence,  <q rend="inline">"There has not been ſo fine a poem ſince Pope's time."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And here it is proper to ſettle, with authentick preciſion, what has long floated in publick report, as to Johnſon's being himſelf the authour of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of that poem. Much, no doubt, both of the ſentiments and expreſſion, were derived from converſation with him; and it was certainly ſubmitted to his friendly reviſion: but in the year 1783, he, at my requeſt, marked with a pencil the lines which he had furniſhed, which are only line 420,
<q>
                     <l>"To ſtop too fearful, and too faint to go;"</l>
                  </q>
and the concluding ten lines, except the laſt couplet but one, which I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by the Italick character:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>

                     <l>" That part which kings or laws can cauſe or cure.</l>
                     <l>" Still to ourſelves in every place conſign'd,</l>
                     <l>" Our own felicity we make or find;</l>
                     <l>" With ſecret courſe, which no loud ſtorms annoy,</l>

               </q>
               <p>He added, <q rend="inline">"Theſe are all of which I can be ſure."</q> They bear a ſmall proportion to the whole, which conſiſts of four hundred and thirty-eight verſes. Goldſmith, in the couplet which he inſerted, mentions <hi>Luke</hi> as a perſon well known, and ſuperficial readers have paſſed it over quite ſmoothly; while thoſe of more attention have been as much perplexed by <hi>Luke,</hi> as by <hi>Lydiat,</hi> in <q rend="inline">"The Vanity of human Wiſhes."</q> The truth is, that Goldſmith himſelf was in a miſtake.

               <p>Talking of education, <q rend="inline">"People have now a days, (ſaid he,) got a ſtrange opinion that every thing ſhould be taught by lectures.

But there was now a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable differencé in his way of living. Having had an illneſs, in which he was adviſed to leave off wine, he had, from that period, continued to abſtain from it, and drank only water, or lemonade.</p>
               <p>I told him that a foreign friend of his, whom I had met with abroad, was ſo wretchedly perverted to infidelity, that he treated the hopes of immortality with brutal levity; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"As man dies like a dog, let him lie like a dog."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"If</hi> he dies like a dog, <hi>let</hi> him lie like a dog."</q> I added, that this man ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"I hate mankind, for I think myſelf one of the beſt of them, and I know how bad I am."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he muſt be very ſingular in his opinion, if he thinks himſelf one of the beſt of men; for none of his friends think him ſo."</q> He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"No honeſt man could be a Deiſt; for no man could be ſo after a fair examination of the proofs of Chriſtianity."</q> I named Hume. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; Hume owned to a clergyman in the biſhoprick of Durham, that he had never read the New Teſtament with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</q> I mentioned Hume's notion, that all who are happy are equally happy; a little miſs with a new gown at a dancing-ſchool ball, a general at the head of a victorious army, and an orator, after having made an eloquent ſpeech in a great aſſembly. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that all who are happy, are equally happy, is not true. A peaſant and a philoſopher may be equally <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> but not equally <hi>happy.</hi> Happineſs conſiſts in the multiplicity of agreeable conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A peaſant has not capacity for having equal happineſs with a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher."</q> I remember this very queſtion very happily illuſtrated in oppoſition to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0548300101:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hume, by the Reverend Mr. Robert Brown, at Utrecht. <q rend="inline">"A ſmall drinking glaſs and a large one, (ſaid he,) may be equally full; but the large one holds more than the ſmall."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon was very kind this evening, and ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"You have now lived five-and-twenty years, and you have employed them well."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Alas, Sir, (ſaid I,) I fear not. Do I know hiſtory? Do I know mathematicks? Do I know law?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, though you may know no ſcience ſo well as to be able to teach it, and no profeſſion ſo well as to be able to follow it, your general maſs of knowledge of books and men renders you very capable to make yourſelf maſter of any ſcience, or fit yourſelf for any profeſſion."</q> I mentioned that a gay friend had adviſed me againſt being a lawyer, becauſe I ſhould be excelled by plodding blockheads. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, in the formulary and ſtatutory part of law, a plodding block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head may excel; but in the ingenious and rational part of it a plodding blockhead can never excel."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked of the mode adopted by ſome to riſe in the world, by courting great men, and aſked him whether he had ever ſubmitted to it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I never was near enough to great men to court them. You may be prudently attached to great men, and yet independent. You are not to do what you think wrong; and, Sir, you are to calculate and not pay too dear for what you get. You muſt not give a ſhilling's worth of court for ſix-pence worth of good. But if you can get a ſhilling's worth of good for ſix-pence worth of court, you are a fool if you do not pay court."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If convents ſhould be allowed at all, they ſhould only be retreats for perſons unable to ſerve the publick, or who have ſerved it. It is our firſt duty to ſerve ſociety, and, after we have done that, we may attend wholly to the ſalvation of our own ſouls. A youthful paſſion for abſtracted devotion ſhould not be encouraged."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I introduced the ſubject of ſecond ſight, and other myſterious manifeſtations; the fulfilment of which, I ſuggeſted might happen by chance. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but they have happened ſo often, that mankind have agreed to think them not fortuitous."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked to him a great deal of what I had ſeen in Corſica, and of my intention to publiſh an account of it. He encouraged me by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"You cannot go to the bottom of the ſubject; but all that you tell us will be new to us. Give us as many anecdotes as you can."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our next meeting at the Mitre was on Saturday the 15th of February, when I preſented to him my old and moſt intimate friend, the Reverend Mr. Temple,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0548300101:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 then of Cambridge. I having mentioned that I had paſſed ſome time with Rouſſeau in his wild retreat, and having quoted ſome remark made by Mr. Wilkes, with whom I had ſpent many pleaſant hours in Italy, Johnſon ſaid, (ſarcaſtically,) <q rend="inline">"It ſeems, Sir, you have kept very good company abroad, Rouſſeau and Wilkes!"</q> Thinking it enough to defend one at a time, I ſaid nothing as to my gay friend, but anſwered with a ſmile, <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, you don't call Rouſſeau bad company. Do you really think <hi>him</hi> a bad man?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if you are talking jeſtingly of this, I don't talk with you. If you mean to be ſerious, I think him one of the worſt of men; a raſcal, who ought to be hunted out of ſociety, as he has been. Three or four nations have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him; and it is a ſhame that he is protected in this country."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't deny, Sir, but that his novel may, perhaps, do harm; but I cannot think his intention was bad."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that will not do. We cannot prove any man's intention to be bad. You may ſhoot a man through the head, and ſay you intended to miſs him; but the Judge will order you to be hanged. An alledged want of intention, when evil is committed, will not be allowed in a court of juſtice. Rouſſeau, Sir, is a very bad man. I would ſooner ſign a ſentence for his tranſportation, than that of any felon who has gone from the Old Bailey theſe many years. Yes, I ſhould like to have him work in the plantations."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sir, do you think him as bad a man as Voltaire?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is difficult to ſettle the proportion of iniquity between them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This violence ſeemed very ſtrange to me, who had read many of Rouſſeau's animated writings with great pleaſure, and even edification, had been much pleaſed with his ſociety, and was juſt come from the Continent, where he was very generally admired. Nor can I yet allow that he deſerves the very ſevere cenſure which Johnſon pronounced upon him. His abſurd preference of ſavage to civiliſed life, and other ſingularities, are proofs rather of a defect in his underſtanding, than of any depravity in his heart. And notwithſtanding the unfavourable opinion which many worthy men have expreſſed of his <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Profeſſion de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard,"</hi>
                  </q> I cannot help admiring it as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a man full of ſincere reverential ſubmiſſion to Divine Myſtery, though beſet with perplexing doubts; a ſtate of mind to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viewed with pity rather than with anger.</p>
               <p>On his favourite ſubject of ſubordination, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"So far is it from being true that men are naturally equal, that no two people can be half an hour together, but one ſhall acquire an evident ſuperiority over the other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0548300101:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I mentioned the advice given us by philoſophers, to conſole ourſelves, when diſtreſſed or embarraſſed, by thinking of thoſe who are in a worfe ſituation than ourſelves. This, I obſerved, could not apply to all, for there muſt be ſome who have nobody worſe than they are. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why to be ſure, Sir, there are; but they don't know it. There is no being ſo poor and ſo contemptible, who does not think there is ſomebody ſtill poorer, and ſtill more contemptible."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As my ſtay in London at this time was very ſhort, I had not many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of being with Dr. Johnſon; but I felt my veneration for him in no degree leſſened, by my having ſeen <hi>multorum hominum mores et urbes.</hi> On the contrary, by having it in my power to compare him with many of the moſt celebrated perſons of other countries, my admiration of his extraordinary mind was increaſed and confirmed.</p>
               <p>The roughneſs, indeed, which ſometimes appeared in his manners, was more ſtriking to me now, from my having been accuſtomed to the ſtudied ſmooth complying habits of the Continent; and I clearly recogniſed in him, not without reſpect for his honeſt conſcientious zeal, the ſame indignant and ſarcaſtical mode of treating every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>attempt to unhinge or weaken good principles.</p>
               <p>One evening, when a young gentleman teized him with an account of the infidelity of his ſervant, who, he ſaid, would not believe the ſcriptures, becauſe he could not read them in the original tongues, and be ſure that they were not invented. <q rend="inline">"Why, fooliſh fellow, (ſaid Johnſon,) has he any better authority for almoſt every thing that he believes?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Then the vulgar, Sir, never can know they are right, but muſt ſubmit themſelves to the learned."</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure, Sir. The vulgar are the children of the ſtate, and muſt be taught like children."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, a poor Turk muſt be a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, juſt as a poor Engliſhman muſt be a Chriſtian?"</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; and what then? This now is ſuch ſtuff as I uſed to talk to my mother, when I firſt began to think myſelf a clever fellow; and ſhe ought to have whipt me for it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another evening Dr. Goldſmith and I called on him, with the hope of prevailing on him to ſup with us at the Mitre. We found him indiſpoſed, and reſolved not to go abroad. <q rend="inline">"Come then, (ſaid Goldſmith,) we will not go to the Mitre to-night, ſince we cannot have the big man with us."</q> Johnſon then called for a bottle of port, of which Goldſmith and I partook, while our friend, now a water drinker ſat by us. GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"I think, Mr. Johnſon, you don't go near the theatres now. You give yourſelf no more concern about a new
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0548300101:311" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 play, than if you had never had any thing to do with the ſtage."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, our taſtes greatly alter. The lad does not care for the child's rattle, and the old man does not care for the young man's whore."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir; but your Muſe was not a whore."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I do not think ſhe was. But as we advance in the journey of life, we drop ſome of the things which have pleaſed us; whether it be that we are fatigued and don't chooſe to carry ſo many things any farther, or that we find other things which we like better."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, why don't you give us ſomething in ſome other way?"</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Ay, Sir, we have a claim upon you."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I am not obliged to do any more. No man is obliged to do as much as he can do. A man is to have part of his life to himſelf. If a ſoldier has fought a good many campaigns, he is not to be blamed if he retires to eaſe and tranquillity. A phyſician, who has practiſed long in a great city, may be excuſed if he retires to a ſmall town, and takes leſs practice. Now, Sir, the good I can do by my converſation bears the ſame proportion to the good I can do by my writings, that the practice of a phyſician, retired to a ſmall town, does to his practice in a great city."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But I wonder, Sir, you have not more pleaſure in writing than in not writing."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you <hi>may</hi> wonder."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked of making verſes, and obſerved, <q rend="inline">"The great difficulty is to know when you have made good ones. When compoſing, I have generally had them in my mind, perhaps fifty at a time, walking up and down in my room; and then I have wrote them down, and often, from lazineſs, have written only half lines. I have written a hundred lines in a day. I remember I wrote a hundred lines of <q rend="inline">"The Vanity of human Wiſhes"</q> in a day. Doctor, (turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Goldſmith,) I am not quite idle; I made one line t'other day; but I made no more."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Let us hear it; we'll put a bad one to it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; I have forgot it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such ſpecimens of the eaſy and playful converſation of the great Dr. Samuel Johnſon are, I think, to be prized; as exhibiting the little varieties of a mind ſo enlarged and ſo powerful when objects of conſequence required its exertions, and as giving us a minute knowledge of his character and modes of thinking.</p>
               <p>After I had been ſome time in Scotland, I mentioned to him in a letter that <q rend="inline">"On my firſt return to my native country, after ſome years of abſence, I was told of a vaſt number of my acquaintance who were all gone to the land of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, and I found myſelf like a man ſtalking over a field of battle, who every moment perceives ſome one lying dead."</q> I complained of irreſolution,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0548300101:312"/>
and mentioned my having made a vow as a ſecurity for good conduct. I wrote to him again, without being able to move his indolence; nor did I hear from him till he had received a copy of my inaugural Exerciſe, or Theſis in Civil Law, which I publiſhed at my admiſſion as an Advocate, as is the cuſtom in Scotland. He then wrote to me as follows:

But as I could hardly venture to quote fragments of old law to ſo claſſical a man as Mr. Johnſon, I have not made an accurate ſearch into theſe remains, to find examples of what I am able to produce in poetical compoſition.

               <p>It appears from his diary, that he was this year at Mr. Thrale's, from before Midſummer till after Michaelmas, and that he afterwards paſſed a month at Oxford. He had then contracted a great intimacy with Mr. Chambers of that Univerſity, now Sir Robert Chambers, one of the Judges in India.</p>
               <p>He publiſhed nothing this year in his own name; but the noble Dedication * to the King, of Gwyn's <q rend="inline">"London and Weſtminſter Improved,"</q> was written by him; and he furniſhed the Preface, † and ſeveral of the pieces, which compoſe a volume of Miſcellanies by Mrs. Anna Williams, the blind lady who had an aſylum in his houſe. Of theſe, there are his <q rend="inline">"Epitaph on Philips, *"</q>

His anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"It is true, Sir, that ſhe wrote it before ſhe was acquainted with me; but ſhe has not told you that I wrote it all over again, except two lines."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"The Fountains, †"</q> a beautiful little Fairy tale in proſe, written with exquiſite ſimplicity, is one of Johnſon's productions; and I cannot with-hold from Mrs. Thrale the praiſe of being the authour of that admirable poem, <q rend="inline">"The Three Warnings."</q>

               <p>He wrote this year a letter not intended for publication, which has, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as ſtrong marks of his ſentiment and ſtyle, as any of his compoſitions. The original is in my poſſeſſion. It is addreſſed to the late Mr. William Drummond, bookſeller in Edinburgh, a gentleman of good family, but ſmall eſtate, who took arms for the houſe of Stuart in 1745; and during his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment in London till the act of general pardon came out, obtained the acquaintance of Dr. Johnſon, who juſtly eſteemed him as a very worthy man. It ſeems, ſome of the members of the ſociety in Scotland for propagating Chriſtian knowledge had oppoſed the ſcheme of tranſlating the holy ſcriptures into the Erſe or Gaelick language, from political conſiderations of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of keeping up the diſtinction between the Highlanders and the other inhabitants of North-Britain. Dr. Johnſon being informed of this, I ſuppoſe by Mr. Drummond, wrote with a generous indignation as follows:

                        <p>I DID not expect to hear that it could be, in an aſſembly convened for the propagation of Chriſtian knowledge, a queſtion whether any nation uninſtructed in religion ſhould receive inſtruction; or whether that inſtruction
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0548300101:318"/>
ſhould be imparted to them by a tranſlation of the holy books into their own  language. If obedience to the will of GOD be neceſſary to happineſs, and knowledge of his will be neceſſary to obedience, I know not how he that with-holds this knowledge, or delays it, can be ſaid to love his neighbour as himſelf. He, that voluntarily continues ignorance, is guilty of all the crimes which ignorance produces; as to him, that ſhould extinguiſh the tapers of a light-houſe, might juſtly be imputed the calamities of ſhipwrecks. Chriſtianity is the higheſt perfection of humanity; and as no man is good but as he wiſhes the good of others, no man can be good in the higheſt degree, who wiſhes not to others the largeſt meaſures of the greateſt good. To omit for a year, or for a day, the moſt efficacious method of advancing Chriſtianity, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with any purpoſes that terminate on this ſide of the grave, is a crime of which I know not that the world has yet had an example, except in the practice of the planters of America, a race of mortals whom, I ſuppoſe, no other man wiſhes to reſemble.</p>
                        <p>The Papiſts have, indeed, denied to the laity the uſe of the bible; but this prohibition, in few places now very rigorouſly enforced, is defended by arguments, which have for their foundation the care of ſouls. To obſcure, upon motives merely political, the light of revelation, is a practice reſerved for the reformed; and, ſurely, the blackeſt midnight of popery is meridian ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine to ſuch a reformation. I am not very willing that any language ſhould be totally extinguiſhed. The ſimilitude and derivation of languages afford the moſt indubitable proof of the traduction of nations, and the genealogy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. They add often phyſical certainty to hiſtorical evidence; and often ſupply the only evidence of ancient migrations, and of the revolutions of ages which left no written monuments behind them.</p>
                        <p>Every man's opinions, at leaſt his deſires, are a little influenced by his favourite ſtudies. My zeal for languages may ſeem, perhaps, rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated, even to thoſe by whom I deſire to be well eſteemed. To thoſe who have nothing in their thoughts but trade or policy, preſent power, or preſent money, I ſhould not think it neceſſary to defend my opinions; but with men of letters I would not unwillingly compound, by wiſhing the continuance of every language, however narrow in its extent, or however incommodious for common purpoſes, till it is repoſited in ſome verſion of a known book, that it may be always hereafter examined and compared with other languages, and then permitting its diſuſe. For this purpoſe, the tranſlation of the bible is moſt to be deſired. It is not certain that the ſame method will not preſerve the Highland language, for the purpoſes of learning, and aboliſh it from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0548300101:319"/>
 daily uſe. When the Highlanders read the Bible, they will naturally wiſh to have its obſcurities cleared, and to know the hiſtory, collateral or appendant. Knowledge always deſires increaſe: it is like fire, which muſt firſt be kindled by ſome external agent, but which will afterwards propagate itſelf. When they once deſire to learn, they will naturally have recourſe to the neareſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by which that deſire can be gratified; and one will tell another that if he would attain knowledge, he muſt learn Engliſh.</p>
                        <p>This ſpeculation may, perhaps, be thought more ſubtle than the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of real life will eaſily admit. Let it, however, be remembered, that the efficacy of ignorance has been long tried, and has not produced the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence expected. Let knowledge, therefore, take its turn; and let the patrons of privation ſtand awhile aſide, and admit the operation of poſitive principles.</p>
                        <p>You will be pleaſed, Sir, to aſſure the worthy man who is employed in the new tranſlation, that he has my wiſhes for his ſucceſs; and if here or at Oxford I can be of any uſe, that I ſhall think it more than honour to promote his undertaking.</p>

                     <p>I muſt take the liberty of engaging you in an office of charity. Mrs. Heely, the wife of Mr. Heely, who had lately ſome office in your theatre, is my near relation, and now in great diſtreſs. They wrote me word of their ſituation ſome time ago, to which I returned them an anſwer which raiſed hopes of more than it is proper for me to give them. Their repreſentation of their affairs I have diſcovered to be ſuch as cannot be truſted; and at this diſtance, though their caſe requires haſte, I know not how to act. She, or her daughters, may be heard of at Canongate Head. I muſt beg, Sir, that you will enquire

If they are in immediate want, advance them what you think proper. What I could do, I would do for the women, having no great reaſon to pay much regard to Heely himſelf <note n="4" place="bottom">This is the perſon concerning whom Sir John Hawkins has thrown out very unwarrantable reflections both againſt Dr. Johnſon and Mr. Francis Barber.</note>.</p>

               <p>The Honourable Thomas Hervey and his lady having unhappily diſagreed, and being about to ſeparate, Johnſon interfered as their friend, and wrote him a letter of expoſtulation, which I have not been able to find; but the ſubſtance of it is aſcertained by a letter to Johnſon, in anſwer to it, which Mr. Hervey printed. The occaſion of this correſpondence between Dr. Johnſon and Mr. Hervey, was thus related to me by Mr. Beauclerk. <q rend="inline">"Tom Hervey had a great liking for Johnſon, and in his will had left him a legacy of fifty pounds. One day he ſaid to me, 'Johnſon may want this money now, more than afterwards. I have a mind to give it him directly. Will you be ſo good as to carry a fifty pound note from me to him?' This I poſitively refuſed to do, as he might, perhaps, have knocked me down for inſulting him, and have afterwards put the note in his pocket. But I ſaid, if Hervey would write him a letter, and encloſe a fifty pound note, I ſhould take care to deliver it. He accordingly did write him a letter, mentioning that he was only paying a legacy a little ſooner. To his letter he added, <hi>'P. S. I am going to part with my wife.'</hi> Johnſon then wrote to him, ſaying nothing of the note, but remonſtrating with him againſt parting with his wife."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I mentioned to Johnſon this ſtory, in as delicate terms as I could, he told me that the fifty pound note was given to him by Mr. Hervey in conſideration of his having written for him a pamphlet againſt Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, who, Mr. Harvey imagined, was the authour of an attack upon him; but that it was afterwards diſcovered to be the work of a garret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, who wrote <q rend="inline">"The Fool:"</q> ſo the pamphlet againſt Sir Charles was not printed.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1767"/> In February, 1767, there happened one of the moſt remarkable incidents of Johnſon's life, which gratified his monarchical enthuſiaſm, and which he loved to relate with all its circumſtances, when requeſted by his friends. This was his being honoured by a private converſation with his Majeſty, in the library at the Queen's houſe. He had frequently viſited thoſe ſplendid rooms
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0548300101:323"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1767. Aetat. 58."/> and noble collection of books <note n="6" place="bottom">Dr. Johnſon had the honour of contributing his aſſiſtance towards the formation of this library; for I have read a long letter from him to Mr. Barnard, giving the moſt maſterly inſtructions on the ſubject. I wiſhed much to have gratified my readers with the peruſal of this letter, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that his Majeſty would have been graciouſly pleaſed to permit its publication; but Mr. Barnard, to whom I applied, declined it <q rend="inline">"on his own account."</q>
                  </note>, which he uſed to ſay was more numerous and curious than he ſuppoſed any perſon could have made in the time which the King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he ſhould have every accommodation that could contribute to his eaſe and convenience, while indulging his literary taſte in that place; ſo that he had here a very agreeable reſource at leiſure hours.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty having been informed of his occaſional viſits, was pleaſed to ſignify a deſire that he ſhould be told when Dr. Johnſon came next to the library. Accordingly, the next time that Johnſon did come, as ſoon as he was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he ſat by the fire, he ſeemed quite intent, Mr. Barnard ſtole round to the apartment where the King was, and, in obedience to his Majeſty's commands, mentioned that Dr. Johnſon was then in the library. His Majeſty ſaid he was at leiſure, and would go to him; upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that ſtood on the King's table, and lighted his Majeſty through a ſuite of rooms, till they came to a private door into the library, of which his Majeſty had the key. Being entered, Mr. Barnard ſtepped forward haſtily to Dr. Johnſon, who was ſtill in a profound ſtudy, and whiſpered him, <q rend="inline">"Sir, here is the King."</q> Johnſon ſtarted up, and ſtood ſtill. His Majeſty approached him, and at once was courteouſly eaſy <note n="7" place="bottom">The particulars of this converſation I have been at great pains to collect with the utmoſt authenticity, from Dr. Johnſon's own detail to myſelf; from Mr. Langton, who was preſent when he gave an account of it to Dr. Joſeph Warton, and ſeveral other friends, at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's; from Mr. Barnard; from the copy of a letter written by the late Mr. Strahan the printer, to Biſhop Warburton; and from a minute, the original of which is among the papers of the late Sir James Caldwell, and a copy of which was moſt obligingly obtained for me from his ſon Sir John Caldwell, by Sir Francis Lumm. To all theſe gentlemen I beg leave to make my grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgements, and particularly to Sir Francis Lumm, who was pleaſed to take a great deal of trouble, and even had the minute laid before the King by Lord Caermarthen, now Duke of Leeds, one of his Majeſty's Principal Secretaries of State, who announced to Sir Francis the Royal pleaſure concerning it by a letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theſe words: <q rend="inline">"I have the King's commands to aſſure you, Sir, how ſenſible his Majeſty is of your attention in communicating the minute of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation previous to its publication. As there appears no objection to your complying with Mr. Boſwell's wiſhes on the ſubject, you are at full liberty to deliver it to that gentleman, to make ſuch uſe of in his Life of Dr. Johnſon, as he may think proper."</q>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty began by obſerving, that he underſtood he came ſometimes to the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0548300101:324"/>
lately at Oxford, aſked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which Johnſon anſwered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford ſometimes, but was likewiſe glad to come back again. The King then aſked him what they were doing at Oxford. Johnſon anſwered, he could not much commend their diligence, but that in ſome reſpects they were mended, for they had put their preſs under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius. He was then aſked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge. He anſwered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; at the ſame time adding, <q rend="inline">"I hope, whether we have more books or not than they have at Cambridge, we ſhall make as good uſe of them as they do."</q> Being aſked whether All-Souls or Chriſt-Church library was the largeſt, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"All-Souls library is the largeſt we have, except the Bodleian."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Aye, (ſaid the King,) that is the publick library."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He anſwered, he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and muſt now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it ſhould ſeem with a view to urge him to rely on his own ſtores as an original writer, and to continue his labours, then ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I do not think you borrow much from any body."</q> Johnſon ſaid, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould have thought ſo too, (ſaid the King,) if you had not written ſo well."</q>—Johnſon obſerved to me, upon this, that <q rend="inline">"No man could have paid a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was deciſive."</q> When aſked by another friend, at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, whether he made any reply to this high compliment, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. When the King had ſaid it, it was to be ſo. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my ſovereign."</q> Perhaps no man who had ſpent his whole life in courts could have ſhewn a more nice and dignified ſenſe of true politeneſs, than Johnſon did in this inſtance.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty having obſerved to him that he ſuppoſed he muſt have read a great deal; Johnſon anſwered, that he thought more than he read; that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for inſtance, he ſaid he had not read much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon which the King ſaid, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of ſuch general knowledge, that you could ſcarce talk with him on any ſubject on which he was not qualified to ſpeak; and that his learning reſembled Garrick's acting, in its univerſality. His Majeſty then talked of the controverſy between Warburton and Lowth, which he ſeemed to have read, and aſked Johnſon what he thought of it. Johnſon anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Warburton has moſt general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0548300101:325" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 moſt ſcholaſtick learning; Lowth is the more correct ſcholar. I do not know which of them calls names beſt."</q> The King was pleaſed to ſay he was of the ſame opinion; adding, <q rend="inline">"You do not think then, Dr. Johnſon, that there was much argument in the caſe."</q> Johnſon ſaid, he did not think there was. <q rend="inline">"Why truly, (ſaid the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is pretty well at an end."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty then aſked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton's hiſtory, which was then juſt publiſhed. Johnſon ſaid, he thought his ſtyle pretty good, but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. <q rend="inline">"Why, (ſaid the King,) they ſeldom do theſe things by halves."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, (anſwered Johnſon,) not to Kings."</q> But fearing to be miſunderſtood, he proceeded to explain himſelf; and immediately ſubjoined, <q rend="inline">"That for thoſe who ſpoke worſe of Kings than they deſerved, he could find no excuſe, but that he could more eaſily conceive how ſome might ſpeak better of them than they deſerved, without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give, thoſe who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their praiſes; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly excuſeable, as far as errour could be excuſeable."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King then aſked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. Johnſon anſwered, that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately mentioned, as an inſtance of it, an aſſertion of that writer, that he had ſeen objects magnified to a much greater degree by uſing three or four micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes at a time, than by uſing one. <q rend="inline">"Now, (added Johnſon,) every one acquainted with microſcopes knows, that the more of them he looks through, the leſs the object will appear."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, (replied the King,) this is not only telling an untruth, but telling it clumſily; for, if that be the caſe, every one who can look through a microſcope will be able to detect him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I now, (ſaid Johnſon to his friends, when relating what had paſſed,) began to conſider that I was depreciating this man in the eſtimation of his ſovereign, and thought it was time for me to ſay ſomething that might be more favourable."</q> He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwithſtanding, a very curious obſerver; and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew, he might have been a very conſiderable man, and needed not to have recourſe to ſuch mean expedients to raiſe his reputation.</p>
               <p>The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the <hi>Journal des Savans,</hi> and aſked Johnſon if it was well done. Johnſon ſaid, it was formerly very well done, and gave ſome account of the perſons who
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0548300101:326" rendition="simple:additions"/>
began it, and carried it on for ſome years; enlarging at the ſame time, on the  nature and uſe of ſuch works. The King aſked him if it was well done now. Johnſon anſwered, he had no reaſon to think that it was. The King then aſked him if there were any other literary journals publiſhed in this kingdom, except the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and on being anſwered there were no other, his Majeſty aſked which of them was the beſt: Johnſon anſwered, that the Monthly Review was done with moſt care, the Critical upon the beſt principles; adding, that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies to the Church. This the King ſaid he was ſorry to hear.</p>
               <p>The converſation next turned on the Philoſophical Tranſactions, when Johnſon obſerved, that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly. <q rend="inline">"Aye, (ſaid the King,) they are obliged to Dr. Johnſon for that;"</q> for his Majeſty had heard and remembered the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which Johnſon himſelf had forgot.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty expreſſed a deſire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed, and propoſed to Dr. Johnſon to undertake it. Johnſon ſignified his readineſs to comply with his Majeſty's wiſhes.</p>
               <p>During the whole of this interview, Johnſon talked to his Majeſty with profound reſpect, but ſtill in his firm manly manner, with a ſonorous voice, and never in that ſubdued tone which is commonly uſed at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnſon ſhewed himſelf highly pleaſed with his Majeſty's converſation and gracious behaviour. He ſaid to Mr. Barnard, <q rend="inline">"Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the fineſt gentleman I have ever ſeen."</q> And he afterwards obſerved to Mr. Langton, <q rend="inline">"Sir, his manners are thoſe of as fine a gentleman as we may ſuppoſe Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, where a circle of Johnſon's friends was collected round him to hear his account of this memorable converſation, Dr. Joſeph Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in preſſing him to mention the particulars. <q rend="inline">"Come now, Sir, this is an intereſting matter; do favour us with it."</q> Johnſon, with great good humour, complied.</p>
               <p>He told them, <q rend="inline">"I found his Majeſty wiſhed I ſhould talk, and I made it my buſineſs to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his ſovereign. In the firſt place, a man cannot be in a paſſion—"</q> Here ſome queſtion interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would have pointed out and illuſtrated many circumſtances of advantage, from being in a ſituation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0548300101:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 During all the time in which Dr. Johnſon was employed in relating to the circle at Sir Joſhua Reynold's the particulars of what paſſed between the King and him, Dr. Goldſmith remained unmoved upon a ſopha at ſome diſtance, affecting not to join in the leaſt in the eager curioſity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He aſſigned as a reaſon for his gloom and ſeeming inattention, that he apprehended Johnſon had relinquiſhed his purpoſe of furniſhing him with a Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it was ſtrongly ſuſpected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the ſingular honour Dr. Johnſon had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankneſs and ſimplicity of his natural character prevailed. He ſprung from the ſopha, advanced to Johnſon, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining himſelf in the ſituation which he had juſt been hearing deſcribed, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Well, you acquitted yourſelf in this converſation better than I ſhould have done; for I ſhould have bowed and ſtammered through the whole of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I received no letter from Johnſon this year; nor have I diſcovered any of the correſpondence<note n="8" place="bottom">It is proper here to mention, that when I ſpeak of his correſpondence, I conſider it indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the voluminous collection of letters which, in the courſe of many years, he wrote to Mrs. Thrale, which forms a ſeparate part of his works; and as a proof of the high eſtimation ſet on any thing which came from his pen, was ſold by that lady for the ſum of five hundred pounds.</note> he had, except the two letters to Mr. Drummond, which have been inſerted, for the ſake of connection with that to the ſame gentleman in 1766. His diary affords no light as to his employment at this time. He paſſed three months at Lichfield; and I cannot omit an affecting and ſolemn ſcene there, as related by himſelf:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Sunday, Oct. 18, 1767. Yeſterday, Oct. 17, at about ten in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I took my leave for ever of my dear old friend, Catherine Chambers, who came to live with my mother about 1724, and has been but little parted from us ſince. She buried my father, my brother, and my mother. She is now fifty-eight years old.</p>
                  <p>I deſired all to withdraw, then told her that we were to part for ever; that as Chriſtians, we ſhould part with prayer; and that I would, if ſhe was willing, ſay a ſhort prayer beſide her. She expreſſed great deſire to hear me; and held up her poor hands, as ſhe lay in bed, with great fervour, while I prayed, kneeling by her, nearly in the following words:</p>
                  <p>Almighty and moſt merciful Father, whoſe loving-kindneſs is over all thy works, behold, viſit, and relieve this thy ſervant, who is grieved with ſickneſs. Grant that the ſenſe of her weakneſs may add ſtrength to her faith, and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her repentance. And grant that by the help of thy Holy Spirit, after the pains and labours of this ſhort life, we may all obtain everlaſting happineſs,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0548300101:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through JESUS CHRIST our Lord; for whoſe ſake hear our prayers. Amen. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I then kiſſed her. She told me, that to part was the greateſt pain that ſhe had ever felt, and that ſhe hoped we ſhould meet again in a better place. I expreſſed, with ſwelled eyes, and great emotion of tenderneſs, the ſame hopes. We kiſſed, and parted. I humbly hope to meet again, and to part no more <note n="9" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 77 and 78.</note>.</p>
               </q>
               <p>By thoſe who have been taught to look upon Johnſon as a man of a harſh and ſtern character, let this tender and affectionate ſcene be candidly read; and let them then judge whether more warmth of heart, and grateful kindneſs, is often found in human nature.</p>
               <p>We have the following notice in his devotional record:</p>

               </p>
               <p>He, however, furniſhed Mr. Adams with a Dedication* to the King of that ingenious gentleman's <q rend="inline">"Treatiſe on the Globes,"</q> conceived and expreſſed in ſuch a manner as could not fail to be very grateful to a monarch, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for his love of the ſciences.</p>

The contraſt might be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but the dignity of the armour muſt remain the ſame in all conſiderate minds.

I found he was at Oxford, with his friend Mr. Chambers, who was now Vinerian Profeſſor, and lived in New Inn Hall. Having had no letter from him ſince that in which he criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the Latinity of my Theſis, and having been told by ſomebody that he was offended at my having put into my book an extract of his letter to me at Paris; I was impatient to be with him, and therefore followed him to Oxford, where I was entertained by Mr. Chambers, with a civility which I ſhall ever gratefully remember. I found that Dr. Johnſon had ſent a letter to me to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and that I had nothing to complain of but his being more indifferent to my anxiety than I wiſhed him to be.

You are not to deceive your clients with falſe repreſentations of your opinion: you are not to tell lies to a judge."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But what do you think of ſupporting a cauſe which you know to be bad?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you do not know it to be good or bad till the Judge deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it. I have ſaid that you are to ſtate facts fairly; ſo that your thinking, or what you call knowing a cauſe to be bad, muſt be from reaſoning, muſt be from your ſuppoſing your arguments to be weak and inconcluſive. But, Sir, that is not enough. An argument which does not convince yourſelf, may convince the Judge to whom you urge it: and if it does convince him, why then, Sir, you are wrong, and he is right. It is his buſineſs to judge; and you are not to be confident in your own opinion that a cauſe is bad, but to ſay all you can for your client, and then hear the Judge's opinion."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, does not affecting a warmth when you have no warmth, and appearing to be clearly of one opinion when you are in reality of another opinion, does not ſuch diſſimulation impair one's honeſty? Is there not ſome danger that a lawyer may put on the ſame maſk in common life, in the intercourſe with his friends?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir. Every body knows you are paid for affecting warmth for your client; and it is, therefore, properly no diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: the moment you come from the bar you reſume your uſual behaviour. Sir, a man will no more carry the artifice of the bar into the common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſociety, than a man who is paid for tumbling upon his hands will continue to tumble upon his hands when he ſhould walk on his feet."</q>

Talking of ſome of the modern plays, he ſaid <q rend="inline">"Falſe Delicacy"</q> was  totally void of character. He praiſed Goldſmith's <q rend="inline">"Good-natured Man;"</q> ſaid, it was the beſt comedy that had appeared ſince <q rend="inline">"The Provoked Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,"</q> and that there had not been of late any ſuch character exhibited on the ſtage as that of Croaker. I obſerved it was the Suſpirius of his Rambler. He ſaid, Goldſmith had owned he had borrowed it from thence. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he,) there is all the difference in the world between characters of nature and characters of manners; and <hi>there</hi> is the difference between the characters of Fielding and thoſe of Richardſon. Characters of manners are very entertaining; but they are to be underſtood, by a more ſuperficial obſerver, than characters of nature, where a man muſt dive into the receſſes of the human heart."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It always appeared to me that he eſtimated the compoſitions of Richardſon too highly, and that he had an unreaſonable prejudice againſt Fielding. In comparing thoſe two writers, he uſed this expreſſion; <q rend="inline">"that there was as great a difference between them as between a man who knew how a watch was made, and a man who could tell the hour by looking on the dial-plate."</q> This was a ſhort and figurative ſtate of his diſtinction between drawing characters of nature and characters only of manners. But I cannot help being of opinion, that the neat watches of Fielding are as well conſtructed as the large clocks of Richardſon, and that his dial-plates are brighter-Fielding's characters, though they do not expand themſelves ſo widely in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation, are as juſt pictures of human nature, and I will venture to ſay, have more ſtriking features, and nicer touches of the pencil; and though Johnſon uſed to quote with approbation a ſaying of Richardſon's, <q rend="inline">"that the virtues of Fielding's heroes were the vices of a truly good man,"</q> I will venture to add, that the moral tendency of Fielding's writings, though it does not encourage a ſtrained and rarely poſſible virtue, is ever favourable to honour and honeſty, and cheriſhes the benevolent and generous affections. He who is as good as Fielding would make him, is an amiable member of ſociety, and may be led on by more regulated inſtructors, to a higher ſtate of ethical perfection.</p>
               <p>Johnſon proceeded: <q rend="inline">"Even Sir Francis Wronghead is a character of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though drawn with great humour."</q> He then repeated, very happily, all Sir Francis's credulous account to Manly of his being with <q rend="inline">"the great man,"</q> and ſecuring a place. I aſked him if the <q rend="inline">"Suſpicious Huſband"</q> did not furniſh a well-drawn character, that of Ranger. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; Ranger is juſt a rake, a mere rake, and a lively young fellow, but no <hi>character."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The great Douglas cauſe was at this time a very general ſubject of diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I found he had not ſtudied it with much attention, but had only heard
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0548300101:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 parts of it occaſionally. He, however, talked of it, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am of opinion that poſitive proof of fraud ſhould not be required of the plaintiff, but that the Judges ſhould decide according as probability ſhall appear to preponderate, granting to the defendant the preſumption of filiation to be ſtrong in his favour. And I think too, that a good deal of weight ſhould be allowed to the dying declarations, becauſe they were ſpontaneous. There is a great difference between what is ſaid without our being urged to it, and what is ſaid from a kind of compulſion. If I praiſe a man's book without being aſked my opinion of it, that is honeſt praiſe, to which one may truſt. But if an authour aſks me if I like his book, and I give him ſomething like praiſe, it muſt not be taken as my real opinion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"I have not been troubled for a long time with authours deſiring my opinion of their works. I uſed once to be ſadly plagued with a man who wrote verſes, but who literally had no other notion of a verſe, but that it conſiſted of ten ſyllables. <hi>Lay your knife and your fork acroſs your plate,</hi> was to him a verſe:
<q>
                        <l>Lay yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ur knife a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd your fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rk, acro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſs your pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te.</l>
                     </q>
As he wrote a great number of verſes he ſometimes by chance made good ones, though he did not know it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He renewed his promiſe of coming to Scotland, and going with me to the Hebrides, but ſaid he would now content himſelf with ſeeing one or two of the moſt curious of them. He ſaid <q rend="inline">"Macaulay, who writes the account of St. Kilda, ſet out with a prejudice againſt prejudices, and wanted to be a ſmart modern thinker; and yet he affirms for a truth, that when a ſhip arrives there all the inhabitants are ſeized with a cold."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He expatiated on the advantages of Oxford for learning. <q rend="inline">"There is here, Sir, (ſaid he,) ſuch a progreſſive emulation. The ſtudents are anxious to appear well to their tutors; the tutors are anxious to have their pupils appear well in the college; the colleges are anxious to have their ſtudents appear well in the Univerſity; and there are excellent rules of diſcipline in every college. That the rules are ſometimes ill obſerved, may be true; but is nothing againſt the ſyſtem. The members of an Univerſity may, for a ſeaſon, be unmindful of their duty. I am arguing for the excellency of the inſtitution."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of Guthrie he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is a man of parts. He has no great regular fund of knowledge; but by reading ſo long, and writing ſo long, he no doubt has picked up a good deal."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid he had lately been a long while at Lichfield, but had grown very weary before he left it. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I wonder at that, Sir; it is your native place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why ſo is Scotland <hi>your</hi> native place."</q>

His prejudice againſt Scotland appeared remarkably ſtrong at this time.  When I talked of our advancement in literature, <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) you have learnt a little from us, and you think yourſelves very great men. Hume would never have written Hiſtory, had not Voltaire written it before him. He is an echo of Voltaire."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, we have Lord Kames."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You <hi>have</hi> Lord Kames. Keep him; ha, ha, ha! We don't envy you him. Do you ever ſee Dr. Robertſon?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Does the dog talk of me?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Indeed, Sir, he does, and loves you."</q> Thinking that I now had him in a corner, and being ſolicitous for the literary fame of my country, I preſſed him for his opinion on the merit of Dr. Robertſon's Hiſtory of Scotland. But, to my ſurprize, he eſcaped.—<q rend="inline">"Sir, I love Robertſon, and I won't talk of his book."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is but juſtice both to him and Dr. Robertſon to add, that though he indulged himſelf in this ſally of wit, he had too good taſte not to be fully ſenſible of the merits of that admirable work.</p>
               <p>An eſſay, written by Mr. Deane, a divine of the Church of England, maintaining the future life of brutes, by an explication of certain parts of the ſcriptures, was mentioned, and the doctrine inſiſted on by a gentleman who ſeemed fond of curious ſpeculation. Johnſon, who did not like to hear of any thing concerning a future ſtate which was not authoriſed by the regular canons of orthodoxy, diſcouraged this talk; and being offended at its continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he watched an opportunity to give the gentleman a blow of reprehenſion. So, when the poor ſpeculatiſt, with a ſerious metaphyſical penſive face, addreſſed him, <q rend="inline">"But really, Sir, when we ſee a very ſenſible dog, we don't know what to think of him."</q> Johnſon, rolling with joy at the thought, which beamed in his eye, turned quickly round, and replied, <q rend="inline">"True, Sir: and when we ſee a very fooliſh <hi>fellow,</hi> we don't know what to think of <hi>him."</hi>
                  </q> He then roſe up, ſtrided to the fire, and ſtood for ſome time laughing and exulting.</p>
               <p>I told him that I had ſeveral times, when in Italy, ſeen the experiment of placing a ſcorpion within a circle of burning coals; that it ran round and round in extreme pain; and finding no way to eſcape, retired to the centre, and, like a true Stoick philoſopher, darted its ſting into its head, and thus at once freed itſelf from its woes. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"This muſt end 'em."</hi>
                  </q> I ſaid, this was a curious fact, as it ſhewed deliberate ſuicide in a reptile. Johnſon would not admit the fact. He ſaid, Maupertuis was of opinion that it does not kill itſelf, but dies of the heat; that it gets to the centre of the circle, as the cooleſt place; that its turning its tail in upon its head is merely a convulſion, and that it does not ſting itſelf. He ſaid he would be ſatisfied if the great anatomiſt Morgagni,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0548300101:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 after diſſecting a ſcorpion upon whom the experiment had been tried, ſhould certify that its ſting had penetrated into its head.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed pleaſed to talk of natural philoſophy. <q rend="inline">"That woodcocks, (ſaid he,) fly over to the northern countries, is proved, becauſe they have been obſerved at ſea. Swallows certainly ſleep all the winter. A number of them conglobulate together, by flying round and round, and then all in a heap throw themſelves under water, and lye in the bed of a river."</q> He told us, one of his firſt eſſays was a Latin poem upon the glow-worm. I am ſorry I did not aſk where it was to be found.</p>
               <p>Talking of the Ruſſians and the Chineſe, he adviſed me to read Bell's travels. I aſked him whether I ſhould read Du Halde's account of China. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, (ſaid he,) as one reads ſuch a book; that is to ſay, conſult it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked of the heinouſneſs of the crime of adultery, by which the peace of families was deſtroyed. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Confuſion of progeny conſtitutes the eſſence of the crime; and therefore a woman who breaks her marriage vows is much more criminal than a man who does it. A man, to be ſure, is criminal in the ſight of GOD: but he does not do his wife a very material injury, if he does not inſult her; if, for inſtance, from mere wantonneſs of appetite, he ſteals privately to her chambermaid. Sir, a wife ought not greatly to reſent this. I would not receive home a daughter who had run away from her huſband on that account. A wife ſhould ſtudy to reclaim her huſband by more attention to pleaſe him. Sir, a man will not, once in a hundred inſtances, leave his wife and go to a harlot, if his wife has not been negligent of pleaſing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I aſked him if it was not hard that one deviation from chaſtity ſhould ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ruin a young woman. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir; it is the great principle which ſhe is taught. When ſhe has given up that principle, ſhe has given up every notion of female honour and virtue, which are all included in chaſtity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman talked to him of a lady whom he greatly admired and wiſhed to marry, but was afraid of her ſuperiority of talents. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) you need not be afraid; marry her. Before a year goes about, you'll find that reaſon much weaker, and that wit not ſo bright."</q> Yet the gentleman may be juſtified in his apprehenſion by one of Dr. Johnſon's admirable ſentences in his life of Waller: <q rend="inline">"He doubtleſs praiſed many whom he would have been afraid to marry; and, perhaps, married one whom he would have been aſhamed to praiſe. Many qualities contribute to domeſtick happineſs, upon which poetry has no colours to beſtow; and many airs and ſallies may delight imagination, which he who flatters them never can approve."</q>

                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0548300101:334"/>
He praiſed Signor Baretti. <q rend="inline">"His account of Italy is a very entertaining  book; and, Sir, I know no man who carries his head higher in converſation than Baretti. There are ſtrong powers in his mind. He has not, indeed, many hooks; but with what hooks he has he grapples very forcibly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At this time I obſerved upon the dial-plate of his watch a ſhort Greek inſcription, taken from the New Teſtament, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being the firſt words of our Saviour's ſolemn admonition to the improvement of that time which is allowed us to prepare for eternity; <q rend="inline">"the night cometh when no man can work."</q> He ſome time afterwards laid aſide this dial-plate; and when I aſked him the reaſon, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It might do very well upon a clock which a man keeps in his cloſet; but to have it upon his watch which he carries about with him, and which is often looked at by others, might be cenſured as oſtentatious."</q> Mr. Steevens is now poſſeſſed of the dial-plate inſcribed as above.</p>
               <p>He remained at Oxford a conſiderable time; I was obliged to go to London, where I received his letter, which had been returned from Scotland.</p>

               <p>Upon his arrival in London in May, he ſurprized me one morning with a viſit at my lodgings in Half-Moon-ſtreet, was quite ſatisfied with my expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and was in the kindeſt and moſt agreeable frame of mind. As he had objected to a part of one of his letters being publiſhed, I thought it right to take this opportunity of aſking him explicitly whether it would be improper to publiſh his letters after his death. His anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, when I am dead, you may do as you will."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked in his uſual ſtyle with a rough contempt of popular liberty. <q rend="inline">"They make a rout about <hi>univerſal</hi> liberty, without conſidering that all that is to be valued, or indeed can be enjoyed by individuals, is <hi>private</hi> liberty. Political liberty is good only ſo far as it produces private liberty. Now, Sir, there is the liberty of the preſs, which you know is a conſtant topick. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you and I and two hundred more were reſtrained from printing our thoughts: what then? What proportion would that reſtraint upon us bear to the private happineſs of the nation?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>This mode of repreſenting the inconveniencies of reſtraint as light and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, was a kind of ſophiſtry in which he delighted to indulge himſelf, in oppoſition to the extreme laxity for which it has been faſhionable for too many to argue, when it is evident, upon reflection, that the very eſſence of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reſtraint; and certain it is, that as government produces rational
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0548300101:336"/>
happineſs, too much reſtraint is better than too little. But when reſtraint is unneceſſary, and ſo cloſe as to gall thoſe who are ſubject to it, the people may and ought to remonſtrate; and, if relief is not granted, to reſiſt. Of this manly and ſpirited principle, no man was more convinced than Johnſon himſelf.</p>
               <p>About this time Dr. Kenrick attacked him, through my ſides, in a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, entitled <q rend="inline">"An Epiſtle to James Boſwell, Eſq. occaſioned by his having tranſmitted the moral Writings of Dr. Samuel Johnſon to Paſcal Paoli, General of the Corſicans."</q> I was at firſt inclined to anſwer this pamphlet; but Johnſon, who knew that my doing ſo would only gratify Kenrick, by keeping alive what would ſoon die away of itſelf, would not ſuffer me to take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>His ſincere regard for Francis Barber, his faithful negro ſervant, made him ſo deſirous of his further improvement, that he now placed him at a ſchool at Biſhop Stortford, in Hertfordſhire. This humane attention does Johnſon's heart much honour. Out of many letters which Mr. Barber received from his maſter, he has preſerved three, which he kindly gave me, and which I ſhall inſert according to their dates.</p>

               <p>Soon afterwards, he ſupped at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, with a company whom I collected to meet him. They were Dr. Percy, now Biſhop of Dromore, Dr. Douglas, now Biſhop of Carliſle, Mr. Langton, Dr. Robertſon the Hiſtorian, Dr. Hugh Blair, and Mr. Thomas Davies, who wiſhed much to be introduced to theſe eminent Scotch literati; but on the preſent occaſion he had very little opportunity of hearing them talk, for with an exceſs of prudence, for which Johnſon afterwards found fault with them, they hardly opened their lips, and that only to ſay ſomething which they were

 certain would not expoſe them to the ſword of Goliah; ſuch was their anxiety for their fame when in the preſence of Johnſon. He was this evening in remarkable vigour of mind, and eager to exert himſelf in converſation, which he did with great readineſs and fluency; but I am ſorry to find that I have preſerved but a ſmall part of what paſſed.</p>
               <p>He allowed high praiſe to Thomſon as a poet; but when one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſaid he was alſo a very good man, our moraliſt conteſted this with great warmth, accuſing him of groſs ſenſuality and licentiouſneſs of manners. I was very much afraid that in writing Thomſon's life, Dr. Johnſon would have treated his private character with a ſtern ſeverity, but I was agreeably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; and I may claim a little merit in it, from my having been at pains to ſend him authentick accounts of the affectionate and generous conduct of that poet to his ſiſters, one of whom, the wife of Mr. Thomſon, ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter at Lanark, I knew, and was preſented by her with three of his letters, one of which Dr. Johnſon has inſerted in his life.</p>
               <p>He was vehement againſt old Dr. Mounſey, of Chelſea College, as <q rend="inline">"a fellow who ſwore and talked bawdy."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I have been often in his company, (ſaid Dr. Percy,) and never heard him ſwear or talk bawdy."</q> Mr. Davies, who ſat next to Dr. Percy, having after this had ſome converſation aſide with him, made a diſcovery which, in his zeal to pay court to Dr. Johnſon, he eagerly proclaimed aloud from the foot of the table: <q rend="inline">"O, Sir, I have found out a very good reaſon why Dr. Percy never heard Mounſey ſwear or talk bawdy; for he tells me, he never ſaw him but at the Duke of Northumberland's table."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"And ſo, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon loudly, to Dr. Percy,) you would ſhield this man from the charge of ſwearing and talking bawdy, becauſe he did not do ſo at the Duke of Northumberland's table. Sir, you might as well tell us that you had ſeen him hold up his hand at the Old Bailey, and he neither ſwore nor talked bawdy; or that you had ſeen him in the cart at Tyburn, and he neither ſwore nor talked bawdy. And is it thus, Sir, that you preſume to controvert what I have related?"</q> Dr. Johnſon's animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was uttered in ſuch a manner, that Dr. Percy ſeemed to be diſpleaſed, and ſoon afterwards left the company, of which Johnſon did not at that time take any notice.</p>
               <p>Swift having been mentioned, Johnſon, as uſual, treated him with little reſpect as an authour. Some of us endeavoured to ſupport the Dean of St. Patrick's, by various arguments. One in particular praiſed his <q rend="inline">"Conduct of the Allies."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, his 'Conduct of the Allies' is a performance of very little ability."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Surely, Sir, (ſaid Dr. Douglas,) you muſt allow it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0548300101:338" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has ſtrong facts."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but what is that to the merit  of the compoſition? In the Seſſions-paper of the Old Bailey there are ſtrong facts. Houſebreaking is a ſtrong fact; robbery is a ſtrong fact; and murder is a <hi>mighty</hi> ſtrong fact: but is great praiſe due to the hiſtorian of thoſe ſtrong facts? No, Sir. Swift has told what he had to tell diſtinctly enough, but that is all. He had to count ten, and he has counted it right."</q>—Then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that Mr. Davies, by acting as an <hi>informer,</hi> had been the occaſion of his talking ſomewhat too harſhly to his friend Dr. Percy, for which, probably, when the firſt ebullition was over, he felt ſome compunction, he took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to give him a hit; ſo added, with a preparatory laugh, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, Tom Davies might have written 'the Conduct of the Allies."</q> Poor Tom being thus ſuddenly dragged into ludicrous notice in preſence of the Scottiſh Doctors, to whom he was ambitious of appearing to advantage, was grievouſly mortified. Nor did his puniſhment reſt here; for upon ſubſequent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whenever he, <q rend="inline">"ſtateſman all o'er,"</q> aſſumed a ſtrutting importance, I uſed to hail him—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"the Authour of the Conduct of the Allies."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When I called upon Dr. Johnſon next morning, I found him highly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his colloquial proweſs the preceding evening. <q rend="inline">"Well, (ſaid he,) we had good talk."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; you toſſed and gored ſeveral perſons."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The late Alexander Earl of Eglintoune, who loved wit more than wine, and men of genius more than ſycophants, had a great admiration of Johnſon; but from the remarkable elegance of his own manners, was, perhaps, too delicately ſenſible of the roughneſs which ſometimes appeared in Johnſon's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. One evening about this time, when his Lordſhip did me the honour to ſup at my lodgings with Dr. Robertſon and ſeveral other men of literary diſtinction, he regretted that Johnſon had not been educated with more refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lived more in poliſhed ſociety. <q rend="inline">"No, no, my Lord, (ſaid Signor Baretti,) do with him what you would, he would always have been a bear."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"True, (anſwered the Earl, with a ſmile,) but he would have been a <hi>dancing</hi> bear."</q>
               </p>
               <p>To obviate all the reflections which have gone round the world to Johnſon's prejudice, by applying to him the epithet of a <hi>bear,</hi> let me impreſs upon my readers a juſt and happy ſaying of my friend Goldſmith, who knew him well: <q rend="inline">"Johnſon, to be ſure, has a roughneſs in his manner; but no man alive has a more tender heart. <hi>He has nothing of the bear but his ſkin."</hi>

               <p>His Majeſty having this year inſtituted the Royal Academy, Johnſon had the honour of being appointed Profeſſor of Ancient Literature.

               <p>I came to London in the autumn, and having informed him that I was going to be married in a few months, I wiſhed to have as much of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as I could before engaging in a ſtate of life which would probably keep me more in Scotland, and prevent my ſeeing him ſo often as when I was a ſingle man; but I found he was at Brighthelmſtone with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I was very ſorry that I had not his company with me at the Jubilee, in honour of Shakſpeare, at Stratford-upon-Avon, the great poet's native

town. Johnſon's connection both with Shakſpeare and Garrick founded a  double claim to his preſence; and it would have been highly gratifying to Mr. Garrick. Upon this occaſion I particularly lamented that he had not that warmth of friendſhip for his brilliant pupil, which we may ſuppoſe would have had a benignant effect on both. When almoſt every man of eminence in the literary world was happy to partake in this feſtival of genius, the abſence of Johnſon could not but be wondered at and regretted. The only trace of him there, was in the whimſical advertiſement of a haberdaſher, who ſold <hi>Shakſperian ribbands</hi> of various dyes; and, by way of illuſtrating their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation to the bard, introduced a line from the celebrated Prologue at the opening of Drury-lane theatre:

                     <p>WHY do you charge me with unkindneſs? I have omitted nothing that could do you good, or give you pleaſure, unleſs it be that I have forborne to tell you my opinion of your account of Corſica. I believe my opinion, if you think well of my judgement, might have given you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but when it is conſidered how much vanity is excited by praiſe, I am not ſure that it would have done you good. Your Hiſtory is like other hiſtories, but your Journal is in a very high degree curious and delightful. There is between the hiſtory and the journal that difference which there will always be found between notions borrowed from without, and notions gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated within. Your hiſtory was copied from books; your journal roſe out of your own experience and obſervation. You expreſs images which operated ſtrongly upon yourſelf, and you have impreſſed them with great force upon your readers. I know not whether I could name any narrative by which curioſity is better excited, or better gratified.</p>
                     <p>I am glad that you are going to be married; and as I wiſh you well in things of leſs importance, wiſh you well with proportionate ardour in this criſis of your life.

 you and value you ſtill more, as you become more regular and uſeful: effects which a happy marriage will hardly fail to produce.</p>
                     <p>I do not find that I am likely to come back very ſoon from this place. I ſhall, perhaps, ſtay a fortnight longer; and a fortnight is a long time to a lover abſent from his miſtreſs. Would a fortnight ever have an end?</p>

               <p>After his return to town, we met frequently, and I continued the practice of making notes of his converſation, though not with ſo much aſſiduity as I wiſh I had done. At this time, indeed, I had a ſufficient excuſe for not being able to appropriate ſo much time to my journal; for General Paoli, after Corſica had been overpowered by the monarchy of France, was now no longer at the head of his brave countrymen, but having with difficulty eſcaped from his native iſland, had ſought an aſylum in Great-Britain; and it was my duty, as well as my pleaſure, to attend much upon him. Such particulars of Johnſon's converſation at this period as I have committed to writing, I ſhall here introduce, without any ſtrict attention to methodical arrangement. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhort notes of different days ſhall be blended together, and ſometimes a day may ſeem important enough to be ſeparately diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, he would not have Sunday kept with rigid ſeverity and gloom, but with a gravity and ſimplicity of behaviour.</p>
               <p>I told him that David Hume had made a ſhort collection of Scotticiſms. <q rend="inline">"I wonder, (ſaid Johnſon,) that <hi>he</hi> ſhould find them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He would not admit the importance of the queſtion concerning the legality of general warrants. <q rend="inline">"Such a power (he obſerved,) muſt be veſted in every government, to anſwer particular caſes of neceſſity; and there can be no juſt complaint but when it is abuſed, for which thoſe who adminiſter government muſt be anſwerable. It is a matter of ſuch indifference, a matter about which the people care ſo very little, that were a man to be ſent over Britain to offer them an exemption from it at a halfpenny a piece, very few would purchaſe it."</q> This was a ſpecimen of that laxity of talking, which I have heard him fairly acknowledge; for, ſurely, while the power of granting general warrants was ſuppoſed to be legal, and the apprehenſion of them hung over our heads, we did not poſſeſs that ſecurity of freedom, congenial to our
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0548300101:342" rendition="simple:additions"/>
happy conſtitution, and which, by the intrepid exertions of Mr. Wilkes, has been happily eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The duration of Parliament, whether for ſeven years or for the life of the King, appears to me ſo immaterial, that I would not give half a crown to turn the ſcale the one way or the other. The <hi>habeas corpus</hi> is the ſingle advantage which our government has over that of other countries."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the 30th of September we dined together at the Mitre. I attempted to argue for the ſuperiour happineſs of the ſavage life, upon the uſual fanciful topicks. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there can be nothing more falſe. The ſavages have no bodily advantages beyond thoſe of civiliſed men. They have not better health; and as to care or mental uneaſineſs, they are not above it, but below it, like bears. No, Sir; you are not to talk ſuch paradox: let me have no more of't. It cannot entertain, far leſs can it inſtruct. Lord Monboddo, one of your Scotch Judges, talked a great deal of ſuch nonſenſe. I ſuffered him; but I will not ſuffer <hi>you."</hi>
                  </q>—BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, does not Rouſſeau talk ſuch nonſenſe?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; but Rouſſeau <hi>knows</hi> he is talking nonſenſe, and laughs at the world for ſtaring at him."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How ſo, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a man who talks nonſenſe ſo well, muſt know that he is talking nonſenſe. But I am <hi>afraid,</hi> (chuckling and laughing,) Monboddo does <hi>not</hi> know that he is talking nonſenſe <note n="3" place="bottom">His Lordſhip having frequently ſpoken in an abuſive manner of Dr. Johnſon, in my company, I on one occaſion during the life-time of my illuſtrious friend could not refrain from retaliation, and repeated to him this ſaying.</note>."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is it wrong then, Sir, to affect ſingularity, in order to make people ſtare?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, if you do it by propagating errour: and, indeed, it is wrong in any way. There is in human nature a general inclination to make people ſtare; and every wiſe man has himſelf to cure of it, and does cure himſelf. If you wiſh to make people ſtare by doing better than others, why, make them ſtare till they ſtare their eyes out. But conſider how eaſy it is to make people ſtare, by being abſurd. I may do it by going into a drawing-room without my ſhoes. You remember the gentleman in <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> who had a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of lunacy taken out againſt him for his extreme ſingularity, ſuch as never wearing a wig, but a night-cap. Now, Sir, abſtractedly, the night-cap was beſt; but, relatively, the advantage was overbalanced by his making the boys run after him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of a London life, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The happineſs of London is not to be conceived but by thoſe who have been in it. I will venture to ſay, there
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0548300101:343" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 is more learning and ſcience within the circumference of ten miles from where we now ſit, than in all the reſt of the kingdom."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The only diſadvantage is the great diſtance at which people live from one another."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but that is occaſioned by the largeneſs of it, which is the cauſe of all the other advantages."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sometimes I have been in the humour of wiſhing to retire to a deſart."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have deſart enough in Scotland."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Although I had promiſed myſelf a great deal of inſtructive converſation with him on the conduct of the married ſtate, of which I had then a near proſpect, he did not ſay much upon that topick. Mr. Seward heard him once ſay, that <q rend="inline">"a man has a very bad chance for happineſs in that ſtate, unleſs he marries a woman of very ſtrong and fixed principles of religion."</q> He maintained to me, contrary to the common notion, that a woman would not be the worſe wife for being learned; in which, from all that I have obſerved of <hi>Artemiſias,</hi> I humbly differed from him.

                     <q rend="inline">"A Wife,"</q> a poem, 1614.</note>, in his rude verſification, has very judiciouſly pointed out that degree of intelligence which is to be deſired in a female companion:</p>

               <p>When I cenſured a gentleman of my acquaintance for marrying a ſecond time, as it ſhewed a diſregard of his firſt wife, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Not at all, Sir. On the contrary, were he not to marry again, it might be concluded that his firſt wife had given him a diſguſt to marriage; but by taking a ſecond wife he pays the higheſt compliment to the firſt, by ſhewing that ſhe made him ſo happy as a married man, that he wiſhes to be ſo a ſecond time.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </q> So ingenious a turn did he give to this delicate queſtion. And yet, on another occaſion, he owned that he once had almoſt aſked a promiſe of Mrs. Johnſon that ſhe would not marry again, but had checked himſelf. Indeed I cannot help thinking, that in his caſe the requeſt would have been unreaſonable; for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0548300101:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if Mrs. Johnſon forgot, or thought it no injury to the memory of her firſt  love,—the huſband of her youth and the father of her children,—to make a ſecond marriage, why ſhould ſhe be precluded from a third, ſhould ſhe be ſo inclined? In Johnſon's perſevering fond appropriation of his <hi>Tetty,</hi> even after her deceaſe, he ſeems totally to have overlooked the prior claim of the honeſt Birmingham trader. I preſume that her having been married before had, at times, given him ſome uneaſineſs; for I remember his obſerving upon the marriage of one of our common friends, <q rend="inline">"He has done a very fooliſh thing, Sir; he has married a widow, when he might have had a maid."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We drank tea with Mrs. Williams. I had laſt year the pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mrs. Thrale at Dr. Johnſon's one morning, and had converſation enough with her to admire her talents, and to ſhew her that I was as Johnſonian as herſelf. Dr. Johnſon had probably been kind enough to ſpeak well of me, for this evening he delivered me a very polite card from Mr. Thrale and her, inviting me to Streatham.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of October I complied with this obliging invitation, and found, at an elegant villa, ſix miles from town, every circumſtance that can make ſociety pleaſing. Johnſon, though quite at home, was yet looked up to with an awe, tempered by affection, and ſeemed to be equally the care of his hoſt and hoſteſs. I rejoiced at ſeeing him ſo happy.</p>
               <p>He played off his wit againſt Scotland with a good humoured pleaſantry, which gave me, though no bigot to national prejudices, an opportunity for a little conteſt with him. I having ſaid that England was obliged to us for gardeners, almoſt all their good gardeners being Scotchmen,—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that is becauſe gardening is much more neceſſary amongſt you than with us, which makes ſo many of your people learn it. It is <hi>all</hi> garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you. Things which grow wild here, muſt be cultivated with great care in Scotland. Pray now, (throwing himſelf back in his chair, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) are you ever able to bring the <hi>ſloe</hi> to perfection?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I boaſted that we had the honour of being the firſt to aboliſh the unhoſpitable, troubleſome, and ungracious cuſtom of giving vails to ſervants. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you aboliſhed vails, becauſe you were too poor to be able to give them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale diſputed with him on the merit of Prior. He attacked him powerfully; ſaid, he wrote of love like a man who had never felt it: his love verſes were college verſes: and he repeated the ſong, <q rend="inline">"Alexis ſhunn'd his fellow ſwains,"</q> &amp;c. in ſo ludicrous a manner, as to make us all wonder how any one could have been pleaſed with ſuch fantaſtical ſtuff. Mrs. Thrale ſtood
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0548300101:345" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 to her gun with great courage, in defence of amorous ditties which Johnſon deſpiſed, till he at laſt ſilenced her by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"My dear Lady, talk no more of this. Nonſenſe can be defended but by nonſenſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale then praiſed Garrick's talent for light gay poetry; and, as a ſpecimen, repeated his ſong in <q rend="inline">"Florizel and Perdita,"</q> and dwelt with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar pleaſure on this line:
<q>
                     <l>"I'd ſmile with the ſimple, and feed with the poor."</l>
                  </q>
JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, my dear Lady, this will never do. Poor David! Smile with the ſimple! What folly is that! And who would feed with the poor that can help it? No, no; let me ſmile with the wiſe, and feed with the rich."</q> I repeated this ſally to Garrick, and wondered to find his ſenſibility as a writer not a little irritated by it. To ſooth him, I obſerved, that Johnſon ſpared none of us; and I quoted the paſſage in Horace, in which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares one who attacks his friends for the ſake of a laugh, to a puſhing ox that is marked by a bunch of hay put upon his horns: <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"foenum habet in cornu."</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Aye, (ſaid Garrick, vehemently,) he has a whole <hi>mow</hi> of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of hiſtory, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We may know hiſtorical facts to be true, as we may know facts in common life to be true. Motives are generally unknown. We cannot truſt to the characters we find in hiſtory, unleſs when they are drawn by thoſe who knew the perſons; as thoſe, for inſtance, by Salluſt and by Lord Clarendon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He would not allow much merit to Whitefield's oratory. <q rend="inline">"His popularity, Sir, (ſaid he,) is chiefly owing to the peculiarity of his manner. He would be followed by crowds were he to wear a night-cap in the pulpit, or were he to preach from a tree."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I know not from what ſpirit of contradiction he burſt out into a violent declamation againſt the Corſicans, of whoſe heroiſm I talked in high terms. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) what is all this rout about the Corſicans? They have been at war with the Genoeſe for upwards of twenty years, and have never yet taken their fortified towns. They might have battered down their walls and reduced them to powder in twenty years. They might have pulled the walls in pieces, and cracked the ſtones with their teeth in twenty years."</q> It was in vain to argue with him upon the want of artillery: he was not to be reſiſted for the moment.</p>
               <p>On the evening of October 10, I preſented Dr. Johnſon to General Paoli. I had greatly wiſhed that two men, for whom I had the higheſt eſteem, ſhould
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0548300101:346" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meet. They met with a manly eaſe, mutually conſcious of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,  and of the abilities of each other. The General ſpoke Italian, and Dr. Johnſon Engliſh, and underſtood one another very well, with a little aid of interpretation from me, in which I compared myſelf to an iſthmus which joins two great continents. Upon Johnſon's approach, the General ſaid, <q rend="inline">"From what I have read of your works, Sir, and from what Mr. Boſwell has told me of you, I have long held you in great veneration."</q> The General talked of languages being formed on the particular notions and manners of a people, without knowing which, we cannot know the language. We may know the direct ſignification of ſingle words; but by theſe no beauty of expreſſion, no ſally of genius, no wit is conveyed to the mind. All this muſt be by alluſion to other ideas. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) you talk of language as if you had never done any thing elſe but ſtudy it, inſtead of governing a nation."</q> The General ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Queſto e un troppo gran complimento,"</hi>
                  </q> this is too great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment. Johnſon anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould have thought ſo, Sir, if I had not heard you talk."</q> The General aſked him, what he thought of the ſpirit of infidelity which was ſo prevalent. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, this gloom of infidelity, I hope, is only a tranſient cloud paſſing through the hemiſphere, which will ſoon be diſſipated, and the ſun break forth with his uſual ſplendour."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"You think then, (ſaid the General,) that they will change their principles like their clothes."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, if they beſtow no more thought on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples than on dreſs, it muſt be ſo."</q> The General ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"a great part of the faſhionable infidelity was owing to a deſire of ſhewing courage. Men who have no opportunities of ſhewing it as to things in this life, take death and futurity as objects on which to diſplay it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is mighty fooliſh affectation. Fear is one of the paſſions of human nature, of which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diveſt it. You remember that the Emperour Charles V. when he read upon the tomb-ſtone of a Spaniſh nobleman, 'Here lies one who never knew fear,' wittily ſaid, 'Then he never ſnuffed a candle with his fingers."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked a few words of French to the General; but finding he did not do it with facility, he aſked for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote the following note:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"J'ai lu dans la geographie de Lucas de Linda un Pater-noſter êcrit dans une langue toutàfait differente de l'Italienne, et de toutes autres leſquelles ſe derivent du Latin. L'auteur l'appelle <hi>linguam Corſicae ruſticam;</hi> elle a peutetre paſſé, peu a peu; mais elle a certainement prevalue autrefois dans les montagnes et dans la campagne. Le même auteur dit la même choſe en parlant de Sardaigne; qu'il y a deux langues dans l'Iſle, une des villes, l'autre de la campagne."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0548300101:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 The General immediately informed him that the <hi>lingua ruſtica</hi> was only in Sardinia.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon went home with me, and drank tea till late in the night. He ſaid, General Paoli had the loftieſt port of any man he had ever ſeen. He denied that military men were always the beſt bred men. Perfect good breeding, he obſerved, conſiſts in having no particular mark of any profeſſion, but a general elegance of manners: whereas, in a military man, you can commonly diſtinguiſh the <hi>brand</hi> of a ſoldier, <hi>l'homme d'epee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon ſhunned to-night any diſcuſſion of the perplexed queſtion of fate and free will, which I attempted to agitate: <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) we <hi>know</hi> our will is free, and <hi>there's</hi> an end of't."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He honoured me with his company at dinner on the 16th of October, at my lodgings in Old Bond-ſtreet, with Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldſmith, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Bickerſtaff, and Mr. Thomas Davies. Garrick played round him with a fond vivacity, taking hold of the breaſts of his coat, and, looking up in his face with a lively archneſs, complimented him on the good health which he ſeemed then to enjoy; while the ſage, ſhaking his head, beheld him with a gentle complacency. One of the company not being come at the appointed hour, I propoſed, as uſual upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to order dinner to be ſerved; adding, <q rend="inline">"Ought ſix people to be kept waiting for one?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why yes, (anſwered Johnſon, with a delicate huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,) if the one will ſuffer more by your ſitting down, than the ſix will do by waiting."</q> Goldſmith, to divert the tedious minutes, ſtrutted about, bragging of his dreſs, and I believe was ſeriouſly vain of it, for his mind was wonderfully prone to ſuch impreſſions. <q rend="inline">"Come, come, (ſaid Garrick,) talk no more of that. You are, perhaps, the worſt—eheh!"</q>—Goldſmith was eagerly attempting to interrupt him, when Garrick went on, laughing ironically, <q rend="inline">"Nay, you will always <hi>look</hi> like a <hi>gentleman;</hi> but I am talking of being well or ill <hi>dreſt."</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, let me tell you, (ſaid Goldſmith,) when my tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he ſaid 'Sir, I have a favour to beg of you. When any body aſks you who made your clothes, be pleaſed to mention John Phielby, at the Harrow, in Water-lane."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that was becauſe he knew the ſtrange colour would attract crouds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and ſee how well he could make a coat even of ſo abſurd a colour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After dinner, our converſation firſt turned upon Pope. Johnſon ſaid, his characters of men were admirably drawn, thoſe of women not ſo well. He repeated to us, in his forcible melodious manner, the concluding lines of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0548300101:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dunciad. While he was talking loudly in praiſe of thoſe lines, one of the  company ventured to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Too fine for ſuch a poem:—a poem on what?"</q> JOHNSON, (with a diſdainful look,) <q rend="inline">"Why, on <hi>dunces.</hi> It was worth while being a dunce then. Ah, Sir, hadſt <hi>thou</hi> lived in thoſe days! It is not worth while being a dunce now, when there are no wits."</q> Bickerſtaff obſerved, as a peculiar circumſtance, that Pope's fame was higher when he was alive than it was then. Johnſon ſaid, his Paſtorals were poor things, though the verſification was fine. He told us, with high ſatisfaction, the anecdote of Pope's inquiring who was the author of his <q rend="inline">"London,"</q> and ſaying he will be ſoon <hi>deterré.</hi> He obſerved, that in Dryden's poetry there were paſſages drawn from a profundity which Pope could never reach. He repeated ſome fine lines on love, by the former, (which I have now forgotten,) and gave great applauſe to the character of Zimri. Goldſmith ſaid, that Pope's character of Addiſon ſhewed a deep knowledge of the human heart. Johnſon ſaid, that the deſcription of the temple, in <q rend="inline">"The Mourning Bride,"</q> was the fineſt poetical paſſage he had ever read; he recollected none in Shakſpeare equal to it.—<q rend="inline">"But, (ſaid Garrick, all alarmed for 'the god of his idolatry,') we know not the extent and variety of his powers. We are to ſuppoſe there are ſuch paſſages in his works. Shakſpeare muſt not ſuffer from the badneſs of our memories."</q> Johnſon, diverted by this enthuſiaſtick jealouſy, went on with greater ardour: <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; Congreve has <hi>nature,"</hi>
                  </q> (ſmiling on the tragick eagerneſs of Garrick;) but compoſing himſelf, he added, <q rend="inline">"Sir, this is not comparing Congreve on the whole, with Shakſpeare on the whole; but only maintaining that Congreve has one finer paſſage than any that can be found in Shakſpeare. Sir, a man may have no more than ten guineas in the world, but he may have thoſe ten guineas in one piece; and ſo may have a finer piece than a man who has ten thouſand pounds: but then he has only one ten-guinea piece.—What I mean is, that you can ſhew me no paſſage where there is ſimply a deſcription of material objects, without any intermixture of moral notions, which produces ſuch an effect."</q> Mr. Murphy mentioned Shakſpeare's deſcription of the night before the battle of Agincourt; but it was obſerved, it had <hi>men</hi> in it. Mr. Davies ſuggeſted the ſpeech of Juliet, in which ſhe figures herſelf awaking in the tomb of her anceſtors. Some one mentioned the deſcription of Dover Cliff. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; it ſhould be all preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,—all vacuum. The crows impede your fall. The diminiſhed appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the boats, and other circumſtances, are all very good deſcription; but do not impreſs the mind at once with the horrible idea of immenſe height. The impreſſion is divided; you paſs on by computation, from one ſtage of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0548300101:349" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the tremendous ſpace to another. Had the girl in <q rend="inline">"The Mourning Bride"</q> ſaid, ſhe could not caſt her ſhoe to the top of one of the pillars in the temple, it would not have aided the idea, but weakened it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of a Barriſter who had a bad utterance, ſome one, (to rouſe Johnſon,) wickedly ſaid, that he was unfortunate in not having been taught oratory by Sheridan. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, if he had been taught by Sheridan, he would have cleared the room."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"Sheridan has too much vanity to be a good man."</q> We ſhall now ſee Johnſon's mode of <hi>defending</hi> a man; taking him into his own hands, and diſcriminating. JOHNSON.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>No, Sir. There is, to be ſure, in Sheridan, ſomething to reprehend, and every thing to laugh at; but, Sir, he is not a bad man. No, Sir; were mankind to be divided into good and bad, he would ſtand conſiderably within the ranks of good. And, Sir, it muſt be allowed that Sheridan excels in plain declamation, though he can exhibit no character."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould, perhaps, have ſuppreſſed this diſquiſition concerning a perſon of whoſe merit and worth I think with reſpect, had he not attacked Johnſon ſo outrageouſly in his Life of Swift, and, at the ſame time, treated us his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers as a ſet of pigmies. He who has provoked the laſh of wit, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that he ſmarts from it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Montague, a lady diſtinguiſhed for having written an Eſſay on Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, being mentioned;—REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"I think that eſſay does her honour."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; it does <hi>her</hi> honour, but it would do nobody elſe honour. I have, indeed, not read it all. But when I take up the end of a web, and find it packthread, I do not expect, by looking further, to find embroidery. Sir, I will venture to ſay, there is not one ſentence of true criticiſm in her book."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, ſurely it ſhews how much Voltaire has miſtaken Shakſpeare, which nobody elſe has done."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, nobody elſe has thought it worth while. And what merit is there in that? You may as well praiſe a ſchoolmaſter for whipping a boy who has conſtrued ill. No, Sir, there is no real criticiſm in it; none ſhewing the beauty of thought, as formed on the workings of the human heart."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The admirers of this Eſſay<note n="4" place="bottom">Of whom I acknowledge myſelf to be one, conſidering it as a piece of the ſecondary or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative ſpecies of criticiſm, and not of that profound ſpecies which alone Dr. Johnſon would allow to be <q rend="inline">"real criticiſm."</q> It is, beſides, clearly and elegantly expreſſed, and has done effectually what it profeſſed to do, namely, vindicated Shakſpeare from the miſrepreſentations of Voltaire; and conſidering how many young people were miſled by his witty, though falſe obſervations, Mrs. Montague's Eſſay was of ſervice to Shakſpeare with a certain claſs of readers, and is, therefore, entitled to praiſe. Johnſon, I am aſſured, allowed the merit which I have ſtated, ſaying, (with reference to Voltaire,) <q rend="inline">"it is concluſive <hi>ad hominem."</hi>
                     </q>
                  </note> may be offended at the ſlighting manner in which Johnſon ſpoke of it; but let it be remembered, that he gave his honeſt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0548300101:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>
opinion, unbiaſſed by any prejudice, or any proud jealouſy of a woman  intruding herſelf into the chair of criticiſm; for Sir Joſhua Reynolds has told me, that when the Eſſay firſt came out, and it was not known who had written it, Johnſon wondered how Sir Joſhua could like it. At this time Sir Joſhua himſelf had received no information concerning the authour, except being aſſured by one of our moſt eminent literati, that it was clear its authour did not know the Greek tragedies in the original. One day at Sir Joſhua's table, when it was related that Mrs. Montague, in an exceſs of compliment to the authour of a modern tragedy, had exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"I tremble for Shakſpeare;"</q> Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"When Shakſpeare has got—for his rival, and Mrs. Montague for his defender, he is in a poor ſtate indeed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon proceeded: <q rend="inline">"The Scotchman has taken the right method in his 'Elements of Criticiſm.' I do not mean that he has taught us any thing; but he has told us old things in a new way."</q> MURPHY. <q rend="inline">"He ſeems to have read a great deal of French criticiſm, and wants to make it his own; as if he had been for years anatomiſing the heart of man, and peeping into every cranny of it."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"It is eaſier to write that book, than to read it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We have an example of true criticiſm in Burke's 'Eſſay on the Sublime and Beautiful;' and, if I recollect, there is alſo Du Bos; and Bouhours, who ſhews all beauty to depend on truth. There is no great merit in telling how many plays have ghoſts in them, and how this ghoſt is better than that. You muſt ſhew how terrour is impreſſed on the human heart.—In the deſcription of night in Macbeth, the beetle and the bat detract from the general idea of darkneſs,—inſpiſſated gloom."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Politicks being mentioned, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"This petitioning is a new mode of diſtreſſing government, and a mighty eaſy one. I will undertake to get peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either againſt quarter guineas or half guineas, with the help of a little hot wine. There muſt be no yielding to encourage this. The object is not important enough. We are not to blow up half a dozen palaces, becauſe one cottage is burning."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation then took another turn. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is amazing what ignorance of certain points one ſometimes finds in men of eminence. A wit about town, who wrote Latin bawdy verſes, aſked me, how it happened that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland, which were once two kingdoms, were now one:—and Sir
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0548300101:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Fletcher Norton did not ſeem to know that there were ſuch publications as the Reviews."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The ballad of Hardyknute has no great merit, if it be really ancient. People talk of nature. But mere obvious nature may be exhibited with very little power of mind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, October 19, I paſſed the evening with him at his houſe. He adviſed me to complete a Dictionary of words peculiar to Scotland, of which I ſhewed him a ſpecimen. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) Ray has made a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of north-country words. By collectiong thoſe of your country, you will do a uſeful thing towards the hiſtory of the language."</q> He bade me alſo go on with collections which I was making upon the antiquities of Scotland. <q rend="inline">"Make a large book; a folio."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But of what uſe will it be, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Never mind the uſe; do it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I complained that he had not mentioned Garrick in his Preface to Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare; and aſked him if he did not admire him. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, as a poor player, who frets and ſtruts his hour upon the ſtage;—as a ſhadow."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But has he not brought Shakſpeare into notice?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, to allow that, would be to lampoon the age. Many of Shakſpeare's plays are the worſe for being acted: Macbeth, for inſtance."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, is nothing gained by decoration and action? Indeed, I do wiſh that you had mentioned Garrick."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, had I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned him, I muſt have mentioned many more: Mrs. Pritchard, Mrs. Cibber,—nay, and Mr. Cibber too; he too altered Shakſpeare."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You have read his apology, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, it is very entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But as for Cibber himſelf, taking from his converſation all that he ought not to have ſaid, he was a poor creature. I remember when he brought me one of his Odes to have my opinion of it, I could not bear ſuch nonſenſe, and would not let him read it to the end; ſo little reſpect had I for <hi>that great man</hi> (laughing). Yet I remember Richardſon wondering that I could treat him with familiarity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned to him that I had ſeen the execution of ſeveral convicts at Tyburn, two days before, and that none of them ſeemed to be under any concern. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Moſt of them, Sir, have never thought at all."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But is not the fear of death natural to man?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"So much ſo, Sir, that the whole of life is but keeping away the thoughts of it."</q> He then, in a low and earneſt tone, talked of his meditating upon the aweful hour of his-own diſſolution, and in what manner he ſhould conduct himſelf upon that occaſion: <q rend="inline">"I know not (ſaid he,) whether I ſhould wiſh to have a friend by me, or have it all between GOD and myſelf."</q>

Talking of our feeling for the diſtreſſes of others;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why,  Sir, there is much noiſe made about it, but it is greatly exaggerated. No, Sir, we have a certain degree of feeling to prompt us to do good: more than that, Providence does not intend. It would be miſery to no purpoſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But ſuppoſe now, Sir, that one of your intimate friends were apprehended for an offence for which he might be hanged."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould do what I could to bail him, and give him any other aſſiſtance; but if he were once fairly hanged, I ſhould not ſuffer."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Would you eat your dinner that day, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; and eat it as if he were eating it with me. Why, there's Baretti, who is to be tried for his life to-morrow, friends have riſen up for him on every ſide; yet if he ſhould be hanged, none of them will eat a ſlice of plumb-pudding the leſs. Sir, that ſympathetick feeling goes a very little way in depreſſing the mind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I told him that I had dined lately at Foote's, who ſhewed me a letter to him from Tom Davies, telling him that he had not been able to ſleep from the concern which he felt on account of <hi>this ſad affair of Baretti,</hi> begging of him to try if he could ſuggeſt any thing that might be of ſervice to him; and at the ſame time recommending to him an induſtrious young man who kept a pickle-ſhop. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aye, Sir, here you have a ſpecimen of human ſympathy; a friend hanged, and a cucumber pickled. We know not whether Baretti or the pickle-man has kept Davies from ſleep, nor does he know himſelf. And as to his not ſleeping, Sir; Tom Davies is a very great man; Tom has been upon the ſtage, and knows how to do thoſe things: I have not been upon the ſtage, and cannot do thoſe things."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I have often blamed myſelf, Sir, for not feeling for others as ſenſibly as many ſay they do."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, don't be duped by them any more. You will find theſe very feeling people are not very ready to do you good. They <hi>pay</hi> you by feeling."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Foote has a great deal of humour?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"He has a ſingular talent of exhibiting character."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is not a talent, it is a vice; it is what others abſtain from. It is not comedy, which exhibits the character of a ſpecies, as that of a miſer gathered from many miſers; it is farce, which exhibits individuals."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Did not he think of exhibiting you, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, fear reſtrained him; he knew I would have broken his bones. I would have ſaved him the trouble of cutting off a leg; I would not have left him a leg to cut off."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, is not Foote an infidel?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not know, Sir, that the fellow is an infidel; but if he be an infidel, he is an infidel as a dog
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0548300101:353" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 is an infidel; that is to ſay, he has never thought upon the ſubject <note n="5" place="bottom">When Mr. Foote was at Edinburgh, he thought fit to entertain a numerous Scotch company with a great deal of coarſe jocularity, at the expence of Dr. Johnſon, imagining it would be acceptable. I felt this as not civil to me, but ſat very patiently till he had exhauſted his merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that ſubject; and then obſerved, that ſurely Johnſon muſt be allowed to have ſome ſterling wit, and that I had heard him ſay a very good thing of Mr. Foote himſelf. <q rend="inline">"Ah, my old friend Sam, (cried Foote,) no man ſays better things: do let us have it."</q> Upon which I told the above ſtory, which produced a very loud laugh from the company. But I never ſaw Foote ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed. He looked grave and angry, and entered into a ſerious refutation of the juſtice of the remark. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, (ſaid he,) talk thus of a man of liberal education;—a man who for years was at the Univerſity of Oxford;—a man who has added ſixteen new characters to the Engliſh drama of his country!"</q>
                     </note>."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe, Sir, he has thought ſuperficially, and ſeized the firſt notions which occurred to his mind."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir, ſtill he is like a dog, that ſnatches the piece next him. Did you never obſerve that dogs have not the power of comparing? A dog will take a ſmall bit of meat as readily as a large, when both are before him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Buchanan (he obſerved,) has fewer <hi>centos</hi> than any modern Latin poet. He not only had great knowledge of the Latin language, but was a great poetical genius. Both the Scaligers praiſe him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He again talked of the paſſage in Congreve with high commendation, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Shakſpeare never has ſix lines together without a fault. Perhaps you may find ſeven: but this does not refute my general aſſertion. If I come to an orchard, and ſay there's no fruit here, and then comes a poring man, who finds two apples and three pears, and tells me, 'Sir, you are miſtaken, I have found both apples and pears,' I ſhould laugh at him: what would that be to the purpoſe?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What do you think of Dr. Young's 'Night Thoughts,' Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, there are very fine things in them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is there not leſs religion in the nation now, Sir, than there was formerly?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I don't know, Sir, that there is."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"For inſtance, there uſed to be a chaplain in every great family, which we do not find now."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Neither do you find many of the ſtate ſervants which great families uſed formerly to have. There is a change of modes in the whole department of life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next day, October 20, he appeared, for the only time I ſuppoſe in his life, as a witneſs in a Court of Juſtice, being called to give evidence to the character of Mr. Baretti, who having ſtabbed a man in the ſtreet, was arraigned
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0548300101:354"/>
at the Old Bailey for murder. Never did ſuch a conſtellation of genius  enlighten the aweful Seſſions Houſe; Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerk, and Dr. Johnſon: and undoubtedly their favourable teſtimony had due weight with the Court and Jury. Johnſon gave his evidence in a ſlow, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and diſtinct manner, which was uncommonly impreſſive. It is well known that Mr. Baretti was acquitted.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of October, we dined together at the Mitre tavern. I found fault with Foote for indulging his talent of ridicule at the expence of his viſitors, which I colloquially termed making fools of his company. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, when you go to ſee Foote, you do not go to ſee a ſaint: you go to ſee a man who will be entertained at your houſe, and then bring you on a publick ſtage; who will entertain you at his houſe, for the very purpoſe of bringing you on a publick ſtage. Sir, he does not make fools of his company; they whom he expoſes are fools already: he only brings them into action."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of trade, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"It is a miſtaken notion that a vaſt deal of money is brought into a nation by trade. It is not ſo. Commodities come from commodities; but trade produces no capital acceſſion of wealth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though there ſhould be little profit in money, there is a conſiderable profit in pleaſure, as it gives to one nation the productions of another; as we have wines and fruits, and many other foreign articles, brought to us."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, and there is a profit in pleaſure, by its furniſhing occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation to ſuch numbers of mankind."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you cannot call that pleaſure to which all are averſe, and which none begin but with the hope of leaving off; a thing which men diſlike before they have tried it, and when they have tried it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, the mind muſt be employed, and we grow weary when idle."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is, Sir, becauſe, others being buſy, we want company; but if we were all idle, there would be no growing weary; we ſhould all entertain one another. There is, indeed, this in trade:—it gives men an opportunity of improving their ſituation. If there were no trade, many who are poor would always remain poor. But no man loves labour for itſelf."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, I know a perſon who does. He is a very laborious Judge, and he loves the labour."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that is becauſe he loves reſpect and diſtinction. Could he have them without labour, he would like it leſs."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"He tells me he likes it for itſelf."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he fancies ſo, becauſe he is not accuſtomed to abſtract."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We went home to his houſe to tea. Mrs. Williams made it with ſufficient dexterity, notwithſtanding her blindneſs, though her manner of ſatisfying
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0548300101:355" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 herſelf that the cups were full enough, was a little aukward: ſhe put her finger down a certain way, till ſhe felt the tea touch it. In my firſt elation at being allowed the privilege of attending Dr. Johnſon at his late viſits to this lady, which was like being è <hi>ſecretioribus conſiliis,</hi> I willingly drank cup after cup, as if it had been the Heliconian ſpring. But as the charm of novelty went off, I grew more faſtidious; and beſides, I diſcovered that ſhe was of a peeviſh temper.</p>
               <p>There was a pretty large circle this evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. Johnſon was in very good humour, lively, and ready to talk upon all ſubjects. Mr. Ferguſſon, the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught philoſopher, told him of a new-invented machine which went without horſes: a man who ſat in it turned a handle, which worked a ſpring that drove it forward. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) what is gained is, the man has his choice whether he will move himſelf alone, or himſelf and the machine too."</q> Dominicetti being mentioned, he would not allow him any merit. <q rend="inline">"There is nothing in all this boaſted ſyſtem. No, Sir; medicated baths can be no better than warm water: their only effect can be that of tepid moiſture."</q> One of the company took the other ſide, maintaining that medicines of various ſorts, and ſome too of moſt powerful effect, are introduced into the human frame by the medium of the pores; and, therefore, when warm water is impregnated with ſalutiferous ſubſtances, it may produce great effects as a bath. This appeared to me very ſatisfactory. Johnſon did not anſwer it; but talking for victory, and determined to be maſter of the field, he had recourſe to the device which Goldſmith imputed to him in the witty-words of one of Cibber's comedies: <q rend="inline">"There is no arguing with Johnſon; for when his piſtol miſſes fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it."</q> He turned to the gentleman, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, go to Dominicetti, and get thyſelf fumigated; but be ſure that the ſteam be directed to thy head, for <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>peccant part."</hi>
                  </q> This produced a triumphant roar of laughter from the motley aſſembly of philoſophers, printers, and dependents, male and female.</p>
               <p>I know not how ſo whimſical a thought came into my mind, but I aſked, <q rend="inline">"If, Sir, you were ſhut up in a caſtle, and a new-born child with you, what would you do?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I ſhould not much like my company."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But would you take the trouble of rearing it?"</q> He ſeemed, as may well be ſuppoſed, unwilling to purſue the ſubject; but upon my perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in my queſtion, replied, <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir, I would; but I muſt have all conveniencies. If I had no garden, I would make a ſhed on the roof, and take it there for freſh air. I ſhould feed it, and waſh it much, and with warm water to pleaſe it, not with cold water to give it pain."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0548300101:356"/>
Sir, does not heat relax?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you are not to imagine the  water is to be very hot. I would not coddle the child. No, Sir, the hardy method of treating children does no good. I'll take you five children from London, who ſhall cuff five Highland children. Sir, a man bred in London will carry a burthen, or run, or wreſtle, as well as a man brought up in the hardieſt manner in the country."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Good living, I ſuppoſe, makes the Londoners ſtrong."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I don't know that it does. Our chairmen from Ireland, who are as ſtrong men as any, have been brought up upon potatoes. Quantity makes up for quality."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Would you teach this child that I have furniſhed you with, any thing?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, I ſhould not be apt to teach it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Would not you have a pleaſure in teaching it?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I ſhould <hi>not</hi> have a pleaſure in teaching it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Have you not a pleaſure in teaching men?—<hi>There</hi> I have you. You have the ſame pleaſure in teaching men, that I ſhould have in teaching children."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, ſomething about that."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Do you think, Sir, that what is called natural affection is born with us? It ſeems to me to be the effect of habit, or of gratitude for kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. No child has it for a parent whom it has not ſeen."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I think there is an inſtinctive natural affection in parents towards their children."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ruſſia being mentioned as likely to become a great empire, by the rapid increaſe of population;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I ſee no proſpect of their propagating more. They can have no more children than they can get. I know of no way to make them breed more than they do. It is not from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and prudence that people marry, but from inclination. A man is poor; he thinks, 'I cannot be worſe, and ſo I'll e'en take Peggy."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But have not nations been more populous at one period than another?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but that has been owing to the people being leſs thinned at one period than another, whether by emigrations, war, or peſtilence, not by their being more or leſs prolifick. Births at all times bear the ſame proportion to the ſame number of people."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, to conſider the ſtate of our own country;—does not throwing a number of farms into one hand hurt population?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir; the ſame quantity of food being produced, will be conſumed by the ſame number of mouths, though the people may be diſpoſed of in different ways. We ſee, if corn be dear, and butchers' meat cheap, the farmers all apply themſelves to the raiſing of corn, till it becomes plentiful and cheap, and then butchers' meat becomes dear; ſo that an equality is always preſerved. No, Sir, let fanciful men do as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0548300101:357" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 they will, depend upon it, it is difficult to diſturb the ſyſtem of life."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, is it not a very bad thing for landlords to oppreſs their tenants, by raiſing their rents?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Very bad. But, Sir, it never can have any general influence; it may diſtreſs ſome individuals. For conſider this: landlords cannot do without tenants. Now tenants will not give more for land than land is worth. If they can make more of their money by keeping a ſhop, or any other way, they'll do it, and ſo oblige landlords to let land come back to a reaſonable rent, in order that they may get tenants. Land, in England, is an article of commerce. A tenant who pays his landlord his rent, thinks himſelf no more obliged to him than you think yourſelf obliged to a man in whoſe ſhop you buy a piece of goods. He knows the landlord does not let him have his land for leſs than he can get from others, in the ſame manner as the ſhopkeeper ſells his goods. No ſhopkeeper ſells a yard of ribband for ſix-pence, when ſeven-pence is the current price."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, is it not better that tenants ſhould be dependent on landlords?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as there are many more tenants than landlords, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſtrictly ſpeaking, we ſhould wiſh not. But if you pleaſe you may let your lands cheap, and ſo get the value, part in money and part in homage. I ſhould agree with you in that."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, you laugh at ſchemes of political improvement."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, moſt ſchemes of political improvement are very laughable things."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Providence has wiſely ordered that the more numerous men are, the more difficult it is for them to agree in any thing, and ſo they are governed. There is no doubt, that if the poor ſhould reaſon, 'We'll be the poor no longer, we'll make the rich take their turn,' they could eaſily do it, were it not that they can't agree. So the common ſoldiers, though ſo much more numerous than their officers, are governed by them for the ſame reaſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mankind have a ſtrong attachment to the habitations to which they have been accuſtomed. You ſee the inhabitants of Norway do not with one conſent quit it, and go to ſome part of America, where there is a mild climate, and where they may have the ſame produce from land, with the tenth part of the labour. No, Sir; their affection for their old dwellings, and the terrour of a general change, keep them at home. Thus, we ſee many of the fineſt ſpots in the world thinly inhabited, and many rugged ſpots well inhabited."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The London Chronicle, which was the only newſpaper he conſtantly took in, being brought, the office of reading it aloud was aſſigned to me. I was
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0548300101:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diverted by his impatience. He made me paſs over ſo many parts of it, that  my taſk was very eaſy. He would not ſuffer one of the petitions to the King about the Middleſex election to be read.</p>
               <p>I had hired a Bohemian as my ſervant while I remained in London, and being much pleaſed with him, I aſked Dr. Johnſon whether his being a Roman Catholick ſhould prevent my taking him with me to Scotland. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir. If <hi>he</hi> has no objection, you can have none."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, you are no great enemy to the Roman Catholick religion."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No more, Sir, than to the Preſbyterian religion."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You are joking."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I really think ſo. Nay, Sir, of the two, I prefer the Popiſh."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How ſo, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the Preſbyterians have no church, no apoſtolical ordination."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And do you think that abſolutely eſſential, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as it was an apoſtolical inſtitution, I think it is dangerous to be without it. And, Sir, the Preſbyterians have no publick worſhip: they have no form of prayer in which they know they are to join. They go to hear a man pray, and are to judge whether they will join with him."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, their doctrine is the ſame with that of the Church of England. Their confeſſion of faith, and the thirty-nine articles, contain the ſame points, even the doctrine of predeſtination."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was a part of the clamour of the times, ſo it is mentioned in our articles, but with as little poſitiveneſs as could be."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, Sir, to believe all the thirty-nine articles?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that is a queſtion which has been much agitated. Some have thought it neceſſary that they ſhould all be believed; others have conſidered them to be only articles of peace, that is to ſay, you are not to preach againſt them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It appears to me, Sir, that predeſtination, or what is equivalent to it, cannot be avoided, if we hold an univerſal preſence in the Deity."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, does not GOD every day ſee things going on without preventing them?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; but if a thing be <hi>certainly</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, it muſt be fixed, and cannot happen otherwiſe; and if we apply this conſideration to the human mind, there is no free will, nor do I ſee how prayer can be of any avail."</q> He mentioned Dr. Clarke, and Biſhop Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall on Liberty and Neceſſity, and bid me read South's ſermons on Prayer; but avoided the queſtion which has excruciated philoſophers and divines beyond any other. I did not preſs it further, when I perceived that he was diſpleaſed, and ſhrunk from any abridgement of an attribute uſually aſcribed to the Divinity, however irreconcileable in its full extent with the grand ſyſtem
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0548300101:359" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of moral government. His ſuppoſed orthodoxy here cramped the vigorous powers of his underſtanding. He was confined by a chain which early imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and long habit made him think maſſy and ſtrong, but which, had he ventured to try, he could at once have ſnapt aſunder.</p>
               <p>I proceeded: <q rend="inline">"What do you think, Sir, of Purgatory, as believed by the Roman Catholicks?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">Why, Sir, it is a very harmleſs doctrine. They are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither ſo obſtinately wicked as to deſerve everlaſting puniſhment, nor ſo good as to merit being admitted into the ſociety of bleſſed ſpirits; and therefore that GOD is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to allow of a middle ſtate, where they may be purified by certain degrees of ſuffering. You ſee, Sir, there is nothing unreaſonable in this."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But then, Sir, their maſſes for the dead?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, if it be once eſtabliſhed that there are ſouls in purgatory, it is as proper to pray for <hi>them,</hi> as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The idolatry of the Maſs?"</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is no idolatry in the Maſs. They believe GOD to be there, and they adore him."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The worſhip of Saints?"</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they do not worſhip ſaints; they invoke them; they only aſk their prayers. I am talking all this time of the <hi>doctrines</hi> of the church of Rome. I grant you that in <hi>practice,</hi> Purgatory is made a lucrative impoſition, and that the people do become idolatrous as they recommend themſelves to the tutelary protection of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſaints. I think their giving the ſacrament only in one kind is criminal, becauſe it is contrary to the expreſs inſtitution of CHRIST, and I wonder how the Council of Trent admitted it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Confeſſion?"</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, I don't know but that is a good thing. The ſcripture ſays, 'Confeſs your faults one to another;' and the prieſts confeſs as well as the laity. Then it muſt be conſidered that their abſolution is only upon repentance, and often upon penance alſo. You think your ſins may be forgiven without penance, upon repentance alone."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I thus ventured to mention all the common objections againſt the Roman Catholick Church, that I might hear ſo great a man upon them. What he ſaid is here accurately recorded. But it is not improbable that if one had taken the other ſide, he might have reaſoned differently.</p>
               <p>I muſt however mention, that he had a reſpect for <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"the old religion,"</hi>
                  </q> as the mild Melancthon called that of the Roman Catholick Church, even while he was exerting himſelf for its reformation in ſome particulars. Sir William Scott informs me, that he heard Johnſon ſay, <q rend="inline">"A man who is converted from Proteſtantiſm to Popery, may be ſincere: he parts with nothing: he is only ſuperadding to what he already had. But a convert from Popery to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0548300101:360" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Proteſtantiſm, gives up ſo much of what he has held as ſacred as any thing  that he retains; there is ſo much <hi>laceration of mind</hi> in ſuch a converſion, that it can hardly be ſincere and laſting."</q> The truth of this reflection may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many and eminent inſtances, ſome of which will occur to moſt of my readers.</p>
               <p>When we were alone, I introduced the ſubject of death, and endeavoured to maintain that the fear of it might be got over. I told him that David Hume ſaid, he was no more uneaſy to think he ſhould <hi>not be</hi> after this life, than that he <hi>had not been</hi> before he began to exiſt. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if he really thinks ſo, his perceptions are diſturbed; he is mad: if he does not think ſo, he lies. He may tell you, he holds his finger in the flame of a candle, without feeling pain; would you believe him? When he dies, he at leaſt gives up all he has."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Foote, Sir, told me, that when he was very ill he was not afraid to die."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is not true, Sir. Hold a piſtol to Foote's breaſt, or to Hume's breaſt, and threaten to kill them, and you'll ſee how they behave."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But may we not fortify our minds for the approach of death?"</q>—Here I am ſenſible I was in the wrong, to bring before his view what he ever looked upon with horrour; for although when in a celeſtial frame, in his <q rend="inline">"Vanity of human Wiſhes,"</q> he has ſuppoſed death to be <q rend="inline">"kind Nature's ſignal for retreat,"</q> from this ſtate of being to <q rend="inline">"a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſeat,"</q> his thoughts upon this aweful change were in general full of diſmal apprehenſions. His mind reſembled the vaſt amphitheatre, the Coliſaeum at Rome. In the centre ſtood his judgement, which, like a mighty gladiator, combated thoſe apprehenſions that, like the wild beaſts of the <hi>Arena,</hi> were all around in cells, ready to be let out upon him. After a conflict, he drives them back into their dens; but not killing them, they were ſtill aſſailing him. To my queſtion, whether we might not fortify our minds for the approach of death, he anſwered, in a paſſion, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, let it alone. It matters not how a man dies, but how he lives. The act of dying is not of importance, it laſts ſo ſhort a time."</q> He added, (with an earneſt look,) <q rend="inline">"A man knows it muſt be ſo, and ſubmits. It will do him no good to whine."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I attempted to continue the converſation. He was ſo provoked, that he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Give us no more of this;"</q> and was thrown into ſuch a ſtate of agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he expreſſed himſelf in a way that alarmed and diſtreſſed me; ſhewed an impatience that I ſhould leave him, and when I was going away, called to me ſternly, <q rend="inline">"Don't let us meet to-morrow."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I went home exceedingly uneaſy. All the harſh obſervations which I had ever heard made upon his character, crowded into my mind; and I ſeemed
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0548300101:361" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 to myſelf like the man who had put his head into the lion's mouth a great many times with perfect ſafety, but at laſt had it bit off.</p>
               <p>Next morning I ſent him a note, ſtating, that I might have been in the wrong, but it was not intentionally; he was therefore, I could not help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, too ſevere upon me. That notwithſtanding our agreement not to meet that day, I would call on him in my way to the city, and ſtay five minutes by my watch. <q rend="inline">"You are, (ſaid I,) in my mind, ſince laſt night, ſurrounded with cloud and ſtorm. Let me have a glimpſe of ſunſhine, and go about my affairs in ſerenity and cheerfulneſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon entering his ſtudy, I was glad that he was not alone, which would have made our meeting more aukward. There were with him, Mr. Steevens and Mr. Tyers, both of whom I now ſaw for the firſt time. My note had, on his own reflection, ſoftened him, for he received me very complacently; ſo that I unexpectedly found myſelf at eaſe, and joined in the converſation.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, the criticks had done too much honour to Sir Richard Blackmore, by writing ſo much againſt him. That in his <q rend="inline">"Creation"</q> he had been helped by various wits, a line by Philips and a line by Tickell; ſo that by theiraid, and that of others, the poem had been made out. I defended Blackmore's lines, which have been ridiculed as abſolute nonſenſe:
<q>
                     <l>"A painted veſt Prince Voltiger had on,</l>
                     <l>"Which from a naked Pict his grandſire won."</l>
                  </q>
I maintained it to be a poetical conceit. A Pict being painted, if he is ſlain in battle, and a veſt is made of his ſkin, it is a painted veſt won from him, though he was naked.</p>
               <p>Johnſon ſpoke unfavourably of a certain pretty voluminous authour, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"He uſed to write anonymous books, and then other books commending thoſe books, in which there was ſomething of raſcality."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I whiſpered him, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, you are now in good humour."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir."</q> I was going to leave him, and had got as far as the ſtair-caſe. He ſtopped me, and ſmiling, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Get you gone,"</q> in a curious mode of inviting me to ſtay, which I accordingly did for ſome time longer.</p>
               <p>This little incidental quarrel and reconciliation, which, perhaps, I may be thought to have detailed too minutely, muſt be eſteemed as one of many proofs which his friends had, that though he might be charged with bad humour at times, he was always a good-natured man; and I have heard Sir Joſhua Reynolds, a nice and delicate obſerver of manners, particularly remark, that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0548300101:362" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when upon any occaſion Johnſon had been rough to any perſon in company,  he took the firſt opportunity of reconciliation, by drinking to him or addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſcourſe to him; but if he found his dignified indirect overtures ſullenly neglected, he was quite indifferent, and conſidered himſelf as having done all that he ought to do, and the other as now in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Being to ſet out for Scotland on the 10th of November, I wrote to him at Streatham, begging that he would meet me in town on the 9th; but if this ſhould be very inconvenient to him, I would go thither. His anſwer was as follows:

               <p>I was detained in town till it was too late on the 9th, ſo went to him early in the morning of the tenth of October. <q rend="inline">"Now (ſaid he,) that you are going to marry, do not expect more from life, than life will afford.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1770"/> In 1770 he publiſhed a political pamphlet, entitled <q rend="inline">"The Falſe Alarm,"</q> intended to juſtify the conduct of miniſtry and their majority in the Houſe of Commons, for having virtually aſſumed it as an axiom, that the expulſion of a Member of Parliament was equivalent to excluſion, and thus having declared Colonel Lutterel to be duly elected for the county of Middleſex, notwithſtanding Mr. Wilkes had a great majority of votes. This being juſtly conſidered as a groſs violation of the right of election, an alarm for the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution extended itſelf all over the kingdom. To prove this alarm to be falſe, was the purpoſe of Johnſon's pamphlet; but even his vaſt powers were inadequate to cope with conſtitutional truth and reaſon, and his argument failed of effect; and the Houſe of Commons have ſince expunged the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive reſolution from their Journals. That the Houſe of Commons might have expelled Mr. Wilkes repeatedly, and as often as he ſhould be re-choſen, was not denied; but incapacitation cannot be but by an act of the whole legiſlature. It was wonderful to ſee how a prejudice in favour of government in general, and an averſion to popular clamour, could blind and contract
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0548300101:364" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch an underſtanding as Johnſon's, in this particular caſe; yet the wit, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1770. Aetat. 61."/> ſarcaſm, the eloquent vivacity which this pamphlet diſplayed, made it be read with great avidity at the time, and it will ever be read with pleaſure, for the ſake of its compoſition. That it endeavoured to infuſe a narcotick indifference, as to publick concerns, into the minds of the people, and that it broke out ſometimes into an extreme coarſeneſs of contemptuous abuſe, is but too evident.</p>
               <p>It muſt not, however, be omitted, that when the ſtorm of his violence ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he takes a fair opportunity to pay a grateful compliment to the King, who had rewarded his merit: <q rend="inline">"Theſe low-born rulers have endeavoured, ſurely without effect, to alienate the affections of the people from the only King who for almoſt a century has much appeared to deſire, or much endeavoured to deſerve them."</q> And, <q rend="inline">"Every honeſt man muſt lament, that the faction has been regarded with frigid neutrality by the Tories, who being long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſignaliſe their principles by oppoſition to the Court, do not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they have at laſt a King who knows not the name of party, and who wiſhes to be the common father of all his people."</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this pamphlet, which was at once diſcovered to be Johnſon's, ſeveral anſwers came out, in which, care was taken to remind the publick of his former attacks upon government, and of his now being a penſioner, without allowing for the honourable terms upon which Johnſon's penſion was granted and accepted, or the change of ſyſtem which the Britiſh court had undergone upon the acceſſion of his preſent Majeſty. He was, however, ſoothed in the higheſt ſtrain of panegyrick, in a poem called <q rend="inline">"The Remonſtrance,"</q> by the Reverend Mr. Stockdale, to whom he was, upon many occaſions, a kind protector.</p>
               <p>The following admirable minute made by him, deſcribes ſo well his own ſtate, and that of numbers to whom ſelf-examination is habitual, that I cannot omit it:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"June 1, 1770. Every man naturally perſuades himſelf that he can keep his reſolutions, nor is he convinced of his imbecillity but by length of time and frequency of experiment. This opinion of our own conſtancy is ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that we always deſpiſe him who ſuffers his general and ſettled purpoſe to be overpowered by an occaſional deſire. They, therefore, whom frequent failures have made deſperate, ceaſe to form reſolutions; and they who are become cunning, do not tell them. Thoſe who do not make them are very few, but of their effect little is perceived; for ſcarcely any man perſiſts in a courſe of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0548300101:365"/>
 life planned by choice, but as he is reſtrained from deviation by ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power. He who may live as he will, ſeldom lives long in the obſervation of his own rules <note n="6" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 95.</note>."</q>

               </p>
               <p>During this year there was a total ceſſation of all correſpondence between Dr. Johnſon and me, without any coldneſs on either ſide, but merely from procraſtination, continued from day to day; and as I was not in London, I had no opportunity of enjoying his company and recording his converſation. To ſupply this blank, I ſhall preſent my readers with ſome <hi>Collectanea,</hi> obligingly furniſhed to me by the Reverend Dr. Maxwell, of Falkland, in Ireland, ſome time aſſiſtant preacher at the Temple, and for many years the ſocial friend of Johnſon, who ſpoke of him with a very kind regard.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>My acquaintance with that great and venerable character commenced in the year 1754. I was introduced to him by Mr. Grierſon <note n="7" place="bottom">Son of the learned Mrs. Grierſon, who was patroniſed by the late Lord Granville, and was the editor of ſeveral of the claſſicks.</note>, his Majeſty's printer at Dublin, a gentleman of uncommon learning, and great wit and vivacity. Mr. Grierſon died in Germany, at the age of twenty-ſeven. Dr. Johnſon highly reſpected his abilities, and often obſerved, that he poſſeſſed more extenſive knowledge than any man of his years he had ever known. His induſtry was equal to his talents; and he particularly excelled in every ſpecies of philological learning, and was, perhaps, the beſt critick of the age he lived in.</p>
                  <p>I muſt always remember with gratitude my obligation to Mr. Grierſon, for the honour and happineſs of Dr. Johnſon's acquaintance and friendſhip, which continued uninterrupted and undiminiſhed to his death: a connection, that was at once the pride and happineſs of my life.</p>
                  <p>What pity it is, that ſo much wit and good ſenſe as he continually exhibited in converſation, ſhould periſh unrecorded! Few perſons quitted his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0548300101:368" rendition="simple:additions"/>
company without perceiving themſelves wiſer and better than they were  before. On ſerious ſubjects he flaſhed the moſt intereſting conviction upon his auditors; and upon lighter topicks, you might have ſuppoſed—<hi>Albano muſas de monte locutas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I can hope to add but little to the celebrity of ſo exalted a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by any communications I can furniſh, yet out of pure reſpect to his memory, I will venture to tranſmit to you ſome anecdotes concerning him, which fell under my own obſervation. The very <hi>minutiae</hi> of ſuch a character muſt be intereſting, and may be compared to the filings of diamonds.</p>
                  <p>In politicks he was deemed a Tory, but certainly was not ſo in the obnoxious or party ſenſe of the term; for while he aſſerted the legal and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary prerogatives of the crown, he no leſs reſpected the conſtitutional liberties of the people. Whiggiſm, at the time of the Revolution, he ſaid, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with certain principles; but latterly, as a mere party diſtinction under Walpole and the Pelhams, was no better than the politicks of ſtock-jobbers, and the religion of infidels.</p>
                  <p>He deteſted the idea of governing by parliamentary corruption, and aſſerted moſt ſtrenuouſly, that a prince ſteadily and conſpicuouſly purſuing the intereſts of his people, could not fail of parliamentary concurrence. A prince of ability, he contended, might and ſhould be the directing ſoul and ſpirit of his own adminiſtration; in ſhort, his own miniſter, and not the mere head of a party: and then, and not till then, would the royal dignity be ſincerely reſpected.</p>
                  <p>Johnſon ſeemed to think, that a certain degree of crown influence over the Houſes of Parliament, (not meaning a corrupt and ſhameful dependence,) was very ſalutary, nay even neceſſary, in our mixed government. <q rend="inline">'For, (ſaid he,) if the members were under no crown influence, and diſqualified from receiving any gratification from Court, and reſembled, as they poſſibly might, Pym and Haſlerig, and other ſtubborn and ſturdy members of the long Parliament, the wheels of government would be totally obſtructed. Such men would oppoſe, merely to ſhew their power, from envy, jealouſy, and perverſity of diſpoſition; and not gaining themſelves, would hate and oppoſe all who did: not loving the perſon of the prince, and conceiving they owed him little gratitude, from the mere ſpirit of inſolence and contradiction, they would oppoſe and thwart him upon all occaſions.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inſeparable imperfection annexed to all human governments, conſiſted, he ſaid, in not being able to create a ſufficient fund of virtue and principle to carry the laws into due and effectual execution. Wiſdom might plan, but
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0548300101:369" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 virtue alone could execute. And where could ſufficient virtue be found? A variety of delegated, and often diſcretionary powers muſt be entruſted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; which, if not governed by integrity and conſcience, would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be abuſed, till at laſt the conſtable would ſell his for a ſhilling.</p>
                  <p>This excellent perſon was ſometimes charged with abetting ſlaviſh and arbitrary principles of government. Nothing in my opinion could be a groſſer calumny and miſrepreſentation; for how can it be rationally ſuppoſed, that he ſhould adopt ſuch pernicious and abſured opinions, who ſupported his philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical character with ſo much dignity, was extremely jealous of his perſonal liberty and independence, and could not brook the ſmalleſt appearance of neglect or inſult, even from the higheſt perſonages?</p>
                  <p>But let us view him in ſome inſtances of more familiar life.</p>
                  <p>His general mode of life, during my acquaintance, ſeemed to be pretty uniform. About twelve o'clock I commonly viſited him, and frequently found him in bed, or declaiming over his tea, which he drank very plentifully. He generally had a levee of morning viſitors, chiefly men of letters; Hawkſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Goldſmith, Murphy, Langton, Steevens, Beauclerk, &amp;c. &amp;c. and ſometimes learned ladies, particularly I remember a French lady of wit and faſhion doing him the honour of a viſit. He ſeemed to me to be conſidered as a kind of publick oracle, whom every body thought they had a right to viſit and conſult; and doubtleſs they were well rewarded. I never could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how he found time for his compoſitions. He declaimed all the morning, then went to dinner at a tavern, where he commonly ſtaid late, and then drank his tea at ſome friend's houſe, over which he loitered a great while, but ſeldom took ſupper. I fancy he muſt have read and wrote chiefly in the night, for I can ſcarely recollect that he ever refuſed going with me to a tavern, and he often went to Ranelagh, which he deemed a place of innocent recreation.</p>
                  <p>He frequently gave all the ſilver in his pocket to the poor, who watched him, between his houſe and the tavern where he dined. He walked the ſtreets at all hours, and ſaid he was never robbed, for the rogues knew he had little money, nor had the appearance of having much.</p>
                  <p>Though the moſt acceſſible and communicative man alive, yet when he ſuſpected he was invited to be exhibited, he conſtantly ſpurned the invitation.</p>
                  <p>Two young women from Staffordſhire viſited him when I was preſent, to conſult him on the ſubject of Methodiſm, to which they were inclined. <q rend="inline">'Come, (ſaid he,) you pretty fools, dine with Maxwell and me at the Mitre, and we will talk over that ſubject;'</q> which they did, and after dinner he took one of them upon his knee, and fondled her for half an hour together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0548300101:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Upon a viſit to me at a country lodging near Twickenham, he aſked  what ſort of ſociety I had there. I told him, but indifferent; as they chiefly conſiſted of opulent traders, retired from buſineſs. He ſaid, he never much liked that claſs of people; <q rend="inline">'For, Sir, (ſaid he,) they have loſt the civility of tradeſmen, without acquiring the manners of gentlemen.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Johnſon was much attached to London: he obſerved, that a man ſtored his mind better there, than any where elſe; and that in remote ſituations a man's body might be feaſted, but his mind was ſtarved, and his faculties apt to degenerate, from want of exerciſe and competition. No place, he ſaid, cured a man's vanity or arrogance, ſo well as London; for as no man was either great or good <hi>per ſe,</hi> but as compared with others not ſo good or great, he was ſure to find in the metropolis many his equals, and ſome his ſuperiours. He obſerved, that a man in London was in leſs danger of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love indiſcreetly, than any where elſe; for there the difficulty of deciding between the conflicting pretenſions of a vaſt variety of objects, kept him ſafe. He told me, that he had frequently been offered country prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he would conſent to take orders; but he could not leave the improved ſociety of the capital, or conſent to exchange the exhilarating joys and ſplendid decorations of publick life, for the obſcurity, inſipidity, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of remote ſituations.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of Mr. Harte, Canon of Windſor, and writer of 'The Hiſtory of Guſtavus Adolphus,' he much commended him as a ſcholar, and a man of the moſt companionable talents he had ever known. He ſaid, the defects in his hiſtory proceeded not from imbecillity, but from foppery.</p>
                  <p>He loved, he ſaid, the old black letter books; they were rich in matter, though their ſtyle was inelegant; wonderfully ſo, conſidering how converſant the writer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy,' he ſaid, was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours ſooner than he wiſhed to riſe.</p>
                  <p>He frequently exhorted me to ſet about writing a Hiſtory of Ireland, and archly remarked, there had been ſome good Iriſh writers, and that one Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might at leaſt aſpire to be equal to another. He had great compaſſion for the miſeries and diſtreſſes of the Iriſh nation, particularly the Papiſts; and ſeverely reprobated the barbarous debilitating policy of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he ſaid was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

 would it be to reſtrain the turbulence of the natives by the authority of the ſword, and to make them amenable to law and juſtice by an effectual and vigorous police, than to grind them to powder by all manner of diſabilities and incapacities. Better (ſaid he,) to hang or drown people at once, than by an unrelenting perſecution to beggar and ſtarve them.'</q> The moderation and humanity of the preſent times have, in ſome meaſure, juſtified the wiſdom of his obſervations.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon was often accuſed of prejudices, nay, antipathy, with regard to the natives of Scotland. Surely, ſo illiberal a prejudice never entered his mind: and it is well known, many natives of that reſpectable country poſſeſſed a large ſhare in his eſteem; nor were any of them ever excluded from his good offices, as far as opportunity permitted. True it is, he conſidered the Scotch, nationally, as a crafty, deſigning people, eagerly attentive to their own intereſt, and too apt to overlook the claims and pretenſions of other people. <q rend="inline">'While they confine their benevolence, in a manner, excluſively to thoſe of their own country, they expect to ſhare in the good offices of other people. Now (ſaid Johnſon,) this principle is either right or wrong; if right, we ſhould do well to imitate ſuch conduct; if wrong, we cannot too much deteſt it.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being ſolicited to compoſe a funeral ſermon for the daughter of a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he naturally enquired into the character of the deceaſed; and being told ſhe was remarkable for her humility and condeſcenſion to inferiours, he obſerved, that thoſe were very laudable qualities, but it might not be ſo eaſy to diſcover who the lady's inferiours were.</p>
                  <p>Of a certain player he remarked, that his converſation uſually threatened and announced more than it performed; that he fed you with a continual reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of hope, to end in a conſtant ſucceſſion of diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>When exaſperated by contradiction, he was apt to treat his opponents with too much acrimony; as, <q rend="inline">'Sir, you don't ſee your way through that queſtion:'—'Sir, you talk the language of ignorance.'</q> On my obſerving to him that a certain gentleman had remained ſilent the whole evening, in the midſt of a very brilliant and learned ſociety, <q rend="inline">'Sir, (ſaid he,) the converſation overflowed and drowned him.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His philoſophy, though auſtere and ſolemn, was by no means moroſe and cynical, and never blunted the laudable ſenſibilities of his character, or exempted him from the influence of the tender paſſions. Want of tenderneſs, he always alledged, was want of parts, and was no leſs a proof of ſtupidity than depravity.</p>

Speaking of Mr. Hanway, who publiſhed 'A Six Weeks Tour through  the South of England,' <q rend="inline">'Jonas, (ſaid he,) acquired ſome reputation by travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling abroad, but loſt it all by travelling at home.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the paſſion of love he remarked, that its violence and ill effects were much exaggerated; for who has known any real ſufferings on that head, more than from the exorbitancy of any other paſſion?</p>
                  <p>He much commended 'Law's Serious Call,' which he ſaid was the fineſt piece of hortatory theology in any language. <q rend="inline">'Law (ſaid he,) fell latterly into the reveries of Jacob Behmen, whom Law alledged to have been ſomewhat in the ſame ſtate with St. Paul, and to have ſeen <hi>unutterable things.</hi> Were it even ſo, (ſaid Johnſon,) Jacob would have reſembled St. Paul ſtill more, by not attempting to utter them.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He obſerved, that the eſtabliſhed clergy in general did not preach plain enough; and that poliſhed periods and glittering ſentences flew over the heads of the common people, without any impreſſion upon their hearts. Something might be neceſſary, he obſerved, to excite the affections of the common people, who were ſunk in languor and lethargy, and therefore he ſuppoſed that the new concomitants of methodiſm might probably produce ſo deſirable an effect. The mind, like the body, he obſerved, delighted in change and novelty, and even in religion itſelf, courted new appearances and modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whatever might be thought of ſome methodiſt teachers, he ſaid, he could ſcarcely doubt the ſincerity of that man, who travelled nine hundred miles in a month, and preached twelve times a week; for no adequate reward, merely temporal, could be given for ſuch indefatigable labour.</p>
                  <p>Of Dr. Prieſtly's theological works, he remarked, that they tended to unſettle every thing, and yet ſettled nothing.</p>
                  <p>He was much affected by the death of his mother, and wrote to me to come and aſſiſt him to compoſe his mind, which indeed I found extremely agitated. He lamented that all ſerious and religious converſation was baniſhed from the ſociety of men, and yet great advantages might be derived from it. All acknowledged, he ſaid, what hardly any body practiſed, the obligation we were under of making the concerns of eternity the governing principles of our lives. Every man, he obſerved, at laſt wiſhes for retreat: he ſees his expectations fruſtrated in the world, and begins to wean himſelf from it, and to prepare for everlaſting ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>He obſerved, that the influence of London now extended every where, and that from all manner of communication being opened, there ſhortly would be no remains of the ancient ſimplicity, or places of cheap retreat to be found.</p>
                  <p>

 He was no admirer of blank-verſe, and ſaid it always failed, unleſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the dignity of the ſubject. In blank-verſe, he ſaid, the language ſuffered more diſtortion, to keep it out of proſe, than any inconvenience or limitation to be apprehended from the ſhackles and circumſcription of rhyme.</p>
                  <p>He reproved me once for ſaying grace without mention of the name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and hoped in future I would be more mindful of the apoſtolical injunction.</p>
                  <p>He refuſed to go out of a room before me at Mr. Langton's houſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hoped he knew his rank better than to preſume to take place of a Doctor in Divinity. I mention ſuch little anecdotes, merely to ſhew the peculiar turn and habit of his mind.</p>
                  <p>He uſed frequently to obſerve, that there was more to be endured than enjoyed, in the general condition of human life; and frequently quoted thoſe lines of Dryden:
<q>
                        <l>'Strange cozenage! none would live paſt years again,</l>
                        <l>'Yet all hope pleaſure from what ſtill remain.'</l>
                     </q>
For his part, he ſaid, he never paſſed that week in his life which he would wiſh to repeat, were an angel to make the propoſal to him.</p>
                  <p>He was of opinion, that the Engliſh nation cultivated both their ſoil and their reaſon better than any other people; but admitted that the French, though not the higheſt, perhaps, in any department of literature, yet in every department were very high. Intellectual pre-eminence, he obſerved, was the higheſt ſuperiority; and that every nation derived their higheſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the ſplendour and dignity of their writers. Voltaire, he ſaid, was a good narrator, and that his principal merit conſiſted in a happy ſelection and arrangement of circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of the French novels, compared with Richardſon's, he ſaid they might be pretty baubles, but a wren was not an eagle.</p>
                  <p>In a Latin converſation with the Pere Boſcovitz, at the houſe of Mrs. Cholmondeley, I heard him maintain the ſuperiority of Sir Iſaac Newton over all foreign philoſophers, with a dignity and eloquence that ſurprized that learned foreigner. It being obſerved to him, that a rage for every thing Engliſh prevailed much in France after Lord Chatham's glorious war, he ſaid, he did not wonder at it, for that we had droubbed thoſe fellows into a proper reverence for us, and that their national petulance required periodical chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.</p>

                  <p>Speaking of the <hi>inward light,</hi> to which ſome methodiſts pretended, he ſaid, it was a principle utterly incompatible with ſocial or civil ſecurity. <q rend="inline">'If a man (ſaid he,) pretends to a principle of action of which I can know nothing, nay, not ſo much as that he has it, but only that he pretends to it; how can I tell what that perſon may be prompted to do?

                  </p>
                  <p>The poem of Fingal, he ſaid, was a mere unconnected rhapſody, a tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome repetition of the ſame images. <q rend="inline">'In vain ſhall we look for the <hi>lucidus ordo,</hi> where there is neither end or object, deſign or moral, <hi>nec certa recurrit imago.'</hi>

                  <p>Speaking of a dull tireſome fellow, whom he chanced to meet, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'That fellow ſeems to me to poſſeſs but one idea, and that is a wrong one.'</q>

                  <p>He ſpoke with much contempt of the notice taken of Woodhouſe, the poetical ſhoemaker. He ſaid, it was all vanity and childiſhneſs; and that ſuch objects were, to thoſe who patroniſed them, mere mirrours of their own ſuperiority. <q rend="inline">'They had better (ſaid he,) furniſh the man with good imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his trade, than raiſe ſubſcriptions for his poems.

                  <p>Speaking of the national debt, he ſaid, it was an idle dream to ſuppoſe that the country could ſink under it. Let the publick creditors be ever ſo clamorous, the intereſt of millions muſt ever prevail over that of thouſands.</p>
                  <p>Of Dr. Kennicott's Collations, he obſerved, that though the text ſhould not be much mended thereby, yet it was no ſmall advantage to know, that we had as good a text as the moſt conſummate induſtry and diligence could procure.</p>
                  <p>Johnſon obſerved, that ſo many objections might be made to every thing, that nothing could overcome them but the neceſſity of doing ſomething. No man would be of any profeſſion, as ſimply oppoſed to not being of it: but every one muſt do ſomething.</p>
                  <p>He remarked, that a London pariſh was a very comfortleſs thing, for the clergyman ſeldom knew the face of one out of ten of his pariſhioners.</p>
                  <p>Of the late Mr. Mallet he ſpoke with no great reſpect: ſaid, he was ready for any dirty job: that he had wrote againſt Byng at the inſtigation of the miniſtry, and was equally ready to write for him, provided he found his account in it.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman who had been very unhappy in marriage, married imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his wife died: Johnſon ſaid, it was the triumph of hope over experience.</p>
                  <p>He obſerved, that a man of ſenſe and education ſhould meet a ſuitable companion in a wife. It was a miſerable thing when the converſation could only be ſuch as, whether the mutton ſhould be boiled or roaſted, and probably a diſpute about that.</p>
                  <p>He did not approve of late marriages, obſerving, that more was loſt in point of time, than compenſated for by any poſſible advantages. Even ill aſſorted marriages were preferable to cheerleſs celibacy.</p>
                  <p>Of old Sheridan he remarked, that he neither wanted parts or literature, but that his vanity and Quixotiſm obſcured his merits.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid, foppery was never cured; it was the bad ſtamina of the mind, which, like thoſe of the body, were never rectified: once a coxcomb, and always a coxcomb.</p>

               <p>In 1771 he publiſhed another political pamphlet, entitled <q rend="inline">"Thoughts on the late Tranſactions reſpecting Falkland's Iſlands,"</q> in which, upon materials furniſhed to him by miniſtry, and upon general topicks expanded in his richeſt ſtyle, he ſucceſsfully endeavoured to perſuade the nation that it was wiſe and laudable to ſuffer the queſtion of right to remain undecided, rather than involve our country in another war. It has been ſuggeſted by ſome, with what truth I ſhall not take upon me to decide, that he rated the conſequence of thoſe iſlands to Great-Britain too low. But however this may be, every humane mind muſt ſurely applaud the earneſtneſs with which he averted the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of war; a calamity ſo dreadful, that it is aſtoniſhing how civiliſed, nay, Chriſtian nations, can deliberately continue to renew it. His deſcription of its miſeries in this pamphlet, is one of the fineſt pieces of eloquence in the Engliſh language. Upon this occaſion, too, we find Johnſon laſhing the party in oppoſition with unbounded ſeverity, and making the fulleſt uſe of what he ever reckoned a moſt effectual argumentative inſtrument, contempt. His character of their very able myſterious champion, JUNIUS, is executed with all the force of his genius, and finiſhed with the higheſt care. He ſeems to have exulted in ſallying forth to ſingle combat againſt the boaſted and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable hero, who bade defiance to <q rend="inline">"principalities and powers, and the rulers of this world."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This pamphlet, it is obſervable, was ſoftened in one particular, after the firſt edition; for the concluſion of Mr. George Grenville's character ſtood thus: <q rend="inline">"Let him not, however, be depreciated in his grave.

                  </q> Which, inſtead of retaining its ſly ſharp point, was reduced to a mere flat unmeaning expreſſion, or, if I may uſe the word,—<hi>truiſm:</hi>

With this view, he wrote a letter to one of the Secretaries of the Treaſury, of which he gave me a copy in his own hand-writing, which is as follows:

                        <p>YOU will eaſily recollect, when I had the honour of waiting upon you ſome time ago, I took the liberty to obſerve to you, that Dr. Johnſon would make an excellent figure in the Houſe of Commons, and heartily wiſhed he had a ſeat there. My reaſons are briefly theſe:</p>
                        <p>I know his perfect good affection to his Majeſty, and his government, which I am certain he wiſhes to ſupport by every means in his power.</p>
                        <p>He poſſeſſes a great ſhare of manly, nervous, and ready eloquence; is quick in diſcerning the ſtrength and weakneſs of an argument; can expreſs himſelf with clearneſs and preciſion, and fears the face of no man alive.</p>
                        <p>His known character, as a man of extraordinary ſenſe and unimpeached virtue, would ſecure him the attention of the Houſe, and could not fail to give him a proper weight there.</p>
                        <p>He is capable of the greateſt application, and can undergo any degree of labour, where he ſees it neceſſary, and where his heart and affections are ſtrongly engaged. His Majeſty's miniſters might therefore ſecurely depend on his doing, upon every proper occaſion, the utmoſt that could be expected from him. They would find him ready to vindicate ſuch meaſures as tended to promote the ſtability of government, and reſolute and ſteady in carrying them into execution. Nor is any thing to be apprehended from the ſuppoſed impetuoſity of his temper. To the friends of the King you will find him a lamb, to his enemies a lion.</p>
                        <p>For theſe reaſons, I humbly apprehend that he would be a very able and uſeful member. And I will venture to ſay, the employment would not be diſagreeable to him; and knowing, as I do, his ſtrong affection to the King, his ability to ſerve him in that capacity, and the extreme ardour with which I am convinced he would engage in that ſervice, I muſt repeat, that I wiſh moſt heartily to ſee him in the Houſe.</p>

If you think this worthy of attention, you will be pleaſed to take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient  opportunity of mentioning it to Lord North. If his Lordſhip ſhould happily approve of it, I ſhall have the ſatisfaction of having been, in ſome degree, the humble inſtrument of doing my country, in my opinion, a very eſſential ſervice. I know your good-nature, and your zeal for the publick welfare, will plead my excuſe for giving you this trouble. I am, with the greateſt reſpect,</p>

               </p>
               <p>This recommendation we know was not effectual; but how, or for what reaſon, can only be conjectured. It is not to be believed that Mr. Strahan would have applied, unleſs Johnſon had approved of it. I never heard him mention the ſubject; but at a later period of his life, when Sir Joſhua Reynolds told him that Mr. Edmund Burke had ſaid, that if he had come early into parliament, he certainly would have been the greateſt ſpeaker that ever was there, Johnſon exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould like to try my hand now."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It has been much agitated among his friends and others, whether he would have been a powerful ſpeaker in Parliament, had he been brought in when advanced in life. I am inclined to think, that his extenſive knowledge, his quickneſs and force of mind, his vivacity and richneſs of expreſſion, his wit and humour, and above all his poignancy of ſarcaſm, would have had great effect in a popular aſſembly; and that the magnitude of his figure, and ſtriking peculiarity of his manner, would have aided the effect. But I remember it was obſerved by Mr. Flood, that Johnſon having been long uſed to ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious brevity and the ſhort flights of converſation, might have failed in that continued and expanded kind of argument, which is requiſite in ſtating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated matters in publick ſpeaking; and as a proof of this he mentioned the ſuppoſed ſpeeches in Parliament written by him for the magazine, none of which, in his opinion, were at all like real debates. The opinion of one who is himſelf ſo eminent an orator, muſt be allowed to have great weight. It was confirmed by Sir William Scott, who mentioned, that Johnſon had told him, that he had ſeveral times tried to ſpeak in the Society of Arts and Sciences, but <q rend="inline">"had found he could not get on."</q> From Mr. William Gerard Hamilton I have heard, that Johnſon, when obſerving to him that it was prudent for a man who had not been accuſtomed to ſpeak in publick to begin his ſpeech in as ſimple a manner as poſſible, acknowledged that he roſe in that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0548300101:379" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſociety to deliver a ſpeech which he had prepared; <q rend="inline">"but (ſaid he,) all my flowers of oratory forſook me."</q> I however cannot help wiſhing, that he <hi>had</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"tried his hand"</q> in parliament; and I wonder that miniſtry did not make the experiment.</p>
               <p>I at length renewed a correſpondence which had been too long diſcontinued:

               <p>In his religious record of this year, we obſerve that he was better than uſual, both in body and mind, and better ſatisfied with the regularity of his
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0548300101:381"/>
 conduct. But he is ſtill <q rend="inline">"trying his ways"</q> too rigorouſly. He charges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with not riſing early enough; yet he mentions what was ſurely a ſufficient excuſe for this, ſuppoſing it to be a duty ſeriouſly required, as he all his life appears to have thought it. <q rend="inline">"One great hindrance is want of reſt; my noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal complaints grow leſs troubleſome towards morning; and I am tempted to repair the deficiencies of the night <note n="8" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 101.</note>."</q> Alas! how hard would it be if this indulgence were to be imputed to a ſick man as a crime. In his retroſpect on the following Eaſter Eve, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"When I review the laſt year, I am able to recollect ſo little done, that ſhame and ſorrow, though perhaps too weakly, come upon me."</q> Had he been judging of any one elſe in the ſame circumſtances, how clear would he have been on the favourable ſide. How very difficult, and in my opinion almoſt conſtitutionally impoſſible it was for him to be raiſed early, even by the ſtrongeſt reſolutions, appears from a note in one of his little paper books, (containing words arranged for his Dictionary,) written, I ſuppoſe, about 1753: <q rend="inline">"I do not remember that ſince I left Oxford, I ever roſe early by mere choice, but once or twice at Edial, and two or three times for the Rambler."</q> I think he had fair ground enough to have quieted his mind on this ſubject, by concluding that he was phyſically incapable of what is at beſt but a commodious regulation.</p>

                     <p>I am coming to London ſoon, and am to appear in an appeal from the Court of Seſſion in the Houſe of Lords. A ſchoolmaſter in Scotland was, by a court of inferiour juriſdiction, deprived of his office for being ſomewhat ſevere in the chaſtiſement of his ſcholars. The Court of Seſſion conſidering it to be dangerous to the intereſt of learning and education to leſſen the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of teachers, and make them afraid of too indulgent parents, inſtigated by the complaints of their children, reſtored him. His enemies have appealed to the Houſe of Lords, though the ſalary is only twenty pounds a year. I was Counſel for him here. I hope there will be little fear of a reverſal; but I muſt beg to have your aid in my plan of ſupporting the decree. It is a general queſtion, and not a point of particular law.</p>

                     <p>THAT you are coming ſo ſoon to town I am very glad; and ſtill more glad that you are coming as an advocate. I think nothing more likely to make your life paſs happily away, than that conſciouſneſs of your own value which eminence in your profeſſion will certainly confer. If I can give you any collateral help, I hope you do not ſuſpect that it will be wanting. My kindneſs for you has neither the merit of ſingular virtue, nor the reproach of ſingular prejudice. Whether to love you be right or wrong, I have many on my ſide: Mrs. Thrale loves you, and Mrs. Williams loves you, and what would have inclined me to love you, if I had been neutral before, you are a great favourite of Dr. Beattie.</p>
                     <p>Of Dr. Beattie I ſhould have thought much, but that his lady puts him out of my head: ſhe is a very lovely woman.</p>
                     <p>The ejection which you come hither to oppoſe, appears very cruel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and oppreſſive. I ſhould think there could not be much doubt of your ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>My health grows better, yet I am not fully recovered. I believe it is held, that men do not recover very faſt after threeſcore. I hope yet to ſee Beattie's College: and have not given up the weſtern voyage. But however all this may be or not, let us try to make each other happy when we meet, and not refer our pleaſure to diſtant times or diſtant places.</p>
                     <p>How comes it that you tell me nothing of your lady? I hope to ſee her ſome time, and till then ſhall be glad to hear of her.</p>

               <p>On the 21ſt of March, I was happy to find myſelf again in my friend's ſtudy, and was glad to ſee my old acquaintance Mr. Francis Barber, who was now returned home. Dr. Johnſon received me with a hearty welcome, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I am glad you are come, and glad you are come upon ſuch an errand,"</q> (alluding to the cauſe of the ſchoolmaſter.) BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I hope, Sir, he will be in no danger. It is a very delicate matter to interfere between a maſter and his ſcholars: nor do I ſee how you can fix the degree of ſeverity that a maſter may uſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, till you fix the degree of obſtinacy and negligence of the ſcholars, you cannot fix the degree of ſeverity of the maſter. Severity muſt be continued until obſtinacy be ſubdued, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be cured."</q> He mentioned the ſeverity of Hunter, his own maſter. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid I,) Hunter is a Scotch name: ſo it ſhould ſeem this ſchoolmaſter who beat you ſo ſeverely was a Scotchman. I can now account for your prejudice againſt the Scotch."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he was not Scotch; and, abating his brutality, he was a very good maſter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of his two political pamphlets, <q rend="inline">"The Falſe Alarm,"</q> and <q rend="inline">"Thoughts concerning Falkland's Iſlands."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, which of them did you think the beſt?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I liked the ſecond beſt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I liked the firſt beſt; and Beattie liked the firſt beſt. Sir, there is a ſubtlety of diſquiſition in the firſt, that is worth all the fire of the ſecond."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, is it true that Lord North paid you a viſit, and that you got two hundred a year in addition to your penſion?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. Except what I had from the bookſeller, I did not get a farthing by them. And, between you and me, I believe Lord North is no friend to me."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How ſo, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you cannot account for the fancies of men.—Well, how does Lord Elibank? and how does Lord Monboddo?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Very well, Sir. Lord Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boddo ſtill maintains the ſuperiority of the ſavage life."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What ſtrange narrowneſs of mind now is that, to think the things we have not known are better than the things which we have known."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that is a common prejudice."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0548300101:385" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 common prejudice ſhould not be found in one whoſe trade it is to rectify errour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman having come in who was to go as a Mate in the ſhip along with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, Dr. Johnſon aſked what were the names of the ſhips deſtined for the expedition. The gentleman anſwered, they were once to be called the Drake and the Raleigh, but now they were to be called the Reſolution and the Adventure. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Much better; for had the Raleigh returned without going round the world, it would have been ridiculous. To give them the names of the Drake and the Raleigh was laying a trap for ſatire."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Had not you ſome deſire to go upon this expedition, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes; but I ſoon laid it aſide. Sir, there is very little of intellectual in the courſe. Beſides, I ſee but at a ſmall diſtance. So it was not worth my while to go to ſee birds fly, which I ſhould not have ſeen fly; and fiſhes ſwim, which I ſhould not have ſeen ſwim."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The gentleman being gone, and Dr. Johnſon having left the room for ſome time, a debate aroſe between the Reverend Mr. Stockdale and Mrs. Deſmou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, whether Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were entitled to any ſhare of glory from their expedition. When Dr. Johnſon returned to us, I told him the ſubject of their diſpute. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it was properly for botany that they went out: I believe they thought only of culling of ſimples."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I thanked him for ſhewing civilities to Beattie. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) I ſhould thank <hi>you.</hi> We all love Beattie. Mrs. Thrale ſays, if ever ſhe has another huſband, ſhe'll have Beattie. He ſunk upon us that he was married; elſe we ſhould have ſhewn his lady more civilities. She is a very fine woman. But how can you ſhew civilities to a non-entity? I did not think he had been married. Nay, I did not think about it one way or other; but he did not tell us of his lady till late."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then ſpoke of St. Kilda, the moſt remote of the Hebrides. I told him, I thought of buying it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Pray do, Sir. We ſhall go and paſs a winter amid the blaſts there. We ſhall have fine fiſh, and we ſhall take ſome dried tongues with us, and ſome books. We ſhall have a ſtrong built veſſel, and ſome Orkney men to navigate her. We muſt build a tolerable houſe: but we may carry with us a wooden houſe ready made, and requiring nothing but to be put up. Conſider, Sir, by buying St. Kilda, you may keep the people from falling into worſe hands. We muſt give them a clergyman, and he ſhall be one of Beattie's chooſing. He ſhall be educated at Mariſchal College. I'll be your Lord Chancellor, or what you pleaſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Are you ſerious, Sir, in adviſing me to buy St. Kilda? for if you ſhould
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0548300101:386" rendition="simple:additions"/>
adviſe me to go to Japan, I believe I ſhould do it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes,  Sir, I am ſerious."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why then I'll ſee what can be done."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I gave him an account of the two parties in the church of Scotland, thoſe for ſupporting the rights of patrons, independent of the people, and thoſe againſt it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It ſhould be ſettled one way or other. I cannot wiſh well to a popular election of the clergy, when I conſider that it occaſions ſuch animoſities, ſuch unworthy courting of the people, ſuch ſlanders between the contending parties, and other diſadvantages. It is enough to allow the people to remonſtrate againſt the nomination of a miniſter for ſolid reaſons;"</q> (I ſuppoſe he meant hereſy or immorality.) He was engaged to dine abroad, and aſked me to return to him in the evening at nine, which I accordingly did.</p>
               <p>We drank tea with Mrs. Williams, who told us a ſtory of ſecond ſight, which happened in Wales where ſhe was born.—He liſtened to it very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and ſaid he ſhould be glad to have ſome inſtances of that faculty well authenticated. His elevated wiſh for more and more evidence for ſpirit, in oppoſition to the groveling belief of materialiſm, led him to a love of ſuch myſterious diſquiſitions. He again juſtly obſerved, that we could have no certainty of the truth of ſupernatural appearances, unleſs ſomething was told us which we could not know by ordinary means, or ſomething done which could not be done but by ſupernatural power; that Pharaoh in reaſon and juſtice required ſuch evidence from Moſes; nay, that our Saviour ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin."</q> He had ſaid in the morning, that <q rend="inline">"Macaulay's Hiſtory of St. Kilda,"</q> was very well written, except ſome foppery about liberty and ſlavery. I mentioned to him that Macaulay told me, he was adviſed to leave out of his book the wonderful ſtory that upon the approach of a ſtranger all the inhabitants catch cold; but that it had been ſo well authenticated, he determined to retain it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, to leave things out of a book, merely becauſe people tell you they will not be believed, is meanneſs. Macaulay acted with more magnanimity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the Roman Catholick religion, and how little difference there was in eſſential matters between ours and it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir: all denominations of Chriſtians have really little difference in point of doctrine, though they may differ widely in external forms. There is a prodigious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the external form of one of your Preſbyterian churches in Scotland, and a church in Italy; yet the doctrine taught is eſſentially the ſame."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned the petition to Parliament for removing the ſubſcription to the Thirty-nine Articles. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It was ſoon thrown out. Sir, they talk
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0548300101:387" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of not making boys at the Univerſity ſubſcribe to what they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; but they ought to conſider, that our Univerſities were founded to bring up members for the Church of England, and we muſt not ſupply our enemies with arms from our arſenal. No, Sir, the meaning of ſubſcribing is, not that they fully underſtand all the articles, but that they will adhere to the Church of England. Now take it in this way, and ſuppoſe that they ſhould only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their adherence to the Church of England, there would be ſtill the ſame difficulty; for ſtill the young men would be ſubſcribing to what they do not underſtand. For if you ſhould aſk them, what do you mean by the Church of England? Do you know in what it differs from the Preſbyterian Church? from the Romiſh Church? from the Greek Church? from the Coptick Church? they could not tell you. So, Sir, it comes to the ſame thing."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, would it not be ſufficient to ſubſcribe the Bible?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir; for all ſects will ſubſcribe the Bible; nay, the Mahometans will ſubſcribe the Bible, for the Mahometans acknowledge JESUS CHRIST, as well as Moſes, but maintain that GOD ſent Mahomet as a ſtill greater prophet than either."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned the motion to aboliſh the faſt of the 30th of January. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I could have wiſhed that it had been a temporary act, perhaps, to have expired with the century. I am againſt aboliſhing it; becauſe that would be declaring it was wrong to eſtabliſh it; but I ſhould have no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make an act, continuing it for another century, and then letting it expire."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He diſapproved of the Royal Marriage Bill; <q rend="inline">"Becauſe (ſaid he,) I would not have the people think that the validity of marriage depends on the will of man, or that the right of a King depends on the will of man. I ſhould not have been againſt making the marriage of any of the royal family, without the approbation of King and Parliament, highly criminal."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the morning we had talked of old families, and the reſpect due to them. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have a right to that kind of reſpect, and are arguing for yourſelf. I am for ſupporting the principle, and am diſintereſted in doing it, as I have no ſuch right."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is one more incitement to a man to do well."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, and it is a matter of opinion, very neceſſary to keep ſociety together. What is it but opinion, by which we have a reſpect for authority, that prevents us, who are the rabble, from riſing up and pulling down you who are gentlemen from your places, and ſaying, 'We will be gentlemen in our turn?' Now, Sir, that reſpect for authority is much more eaſily granted to a man whoſe father has had it, than to an upſtart, and ſo Society is more eaſily ſupported."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, it might be

done by the reſpect belonging to office, as among the Romans, where the dreſs,  the <hi>toga,</hi> inſpired reverence."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, we know very little about the Romans. But, ſurely, it is much eaſier to reſpect a man who has always had reſpect, than to reſpect a man who we know was laſt year no better than ourſelves, and will be no better next year. In republicks there is not a reſpect for authority, but a fear of power."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"At preſent, Sir, I think riches ſeem to gain moſt reſpect."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, riches do not gain hearty reſpect; they only procure external attention. A very rich man, from low beginnings, may buy his election in a borough; but, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> a man of family will be preferred. People will prefer a man for whoſe father their fathers have voted, though they ſhould get no more money, or even leſs. That ſhews that the reſpect for family is not merely fanciful, but has an actual operation. If gentlemen of family would allow the rich upſtarts to ſpend their money profuſely, which they are ready enough to do, and not vie with them in expence, the upſtarts would ſoon be at an end, and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would remain: but if the gentlemen will vie in expence with the upſtarts, which is very fooliſh, they muſt be ruined."</q>

               <p>I gave him an account of the excellent mimickry of a friend of mine in Scotland; obſerving, at the ſame time, that ſome people thought it a very mean thing. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is making a very mean uſe of a man's powers. But to be a good mimick, requires great powers, great acuteneſs of obſervation, great retention of what is obſerved, and great pliancy of organs, to repreſent what is obſerved. I remember a lady of quality in this town, Lady—, who was a wonderful mimick, and uſed to make me laugh immoderately. I have heard ſhe is now gone mad."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It is amazing how a mimick can not only give you the geſtures and voice of a perſon whom he repreſents; but even what a perſon would ſay on any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubject."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to conſider that the manner and ſome particular phraſes of a perſon do much to impreſs you with an idea of him, and you are not ſure that he would ſay what the mimick ſays in his character."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't think Foote a good mimick, Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; his imitations are not like. He gives you ſomething different from himſelf, but not the character which he means to aſſume. He goes out of himſelf without going into other people. He cannot take off any perſon unleſs he is very ſtrongly marked, ſuch as George Faulkner. He is like a painter, who can draw the portrait of a man who has a wen upon his face, and who, therefore, is eaſily known. If a man hops upon one leg, Foote can hop upon one leg. But he has not that nice diſcrimination which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0548300101:389" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 your friend ſeems to poſſes. Foote is, however, very entertaining, with a kind of converſation between wit and buffoonery."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, March 23, I found him buſy, preparing a fourth edition of his folio Dictionary. Mr. Peyton, one of his original amanuenſes, was writing for him. I put him in mind of a meaning of the word <hi>ſide,</hi> which he had omitted, viz. relationſhip; as, father's ſide, mother's ſide. He inſerted it. I aſked him if <hi>humiliating</hi> was a good word. He ſaid, he had ſeen it frequently uſed, but he did not know it to be legitimate Engliſh. He would not admit <hi>civilization,</hi> but only <hi>civility.</hi> With great deference to him, I thought <hi>civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi> from <hi>to civilize,</hi> better in the ſenſe oppoſed to <hi>barbarity,</hi> than <hi>civility,</hi> as it is better to have a diſtinct word for each ſenſe, than one word with two ſenſes, which <hi>civility</hi> is, in his way of uſing it.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed buſy about ſome ſort of chymical operation. I was entertained by obſerving how he contrived to ſend Mr. Peyton on an errand, without ſeeming to degrade him. <q rend="inline">"Mr. Peyton,—Mr. Peyton,—will you be ſo good as to take a walk to Temple-bar? You will there ſee a chymiſt's ſhop; at which you will be pleaſed to buy for me an ounce of oil of vitriol; not ſpirit of vitriol, but oil of vitriol. It will coſt three half-pence."</q> Peyton im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went, and returned with it, and told him it coſt but a penny.</p>
               <p>I then reminded him of the ſchoolmaſter's cauſe, and propoſed to read to him the printed papers concerning it. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, (ſaid he,) I can read quicker than I can hear."</q> So he read them to himſelf.</p>
               <p>After he had read for ſome time, we were interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Kriſtrom, a Swede, who was tutor to ſome young gentlemen in the city. He told me, that there was a very good Hiſtory of Sweden, by Daline. Having at that time an intention of writing the hiſtory of that country, I aſked Dr. Johnſon whether one might write a hiſtory of Sweden without going thither. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, (ſaid he,) one for common uſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of languages. Johnſon obſerved, that Leibnitz had made ſome progreſs in a work, tracing all languages up to the Hebrew. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) you would not imagine that the French <hi>jour,</hi> day, is derived from the Latin <hi>dies,</hi> and yet nothing is more certain; and the intermediate ſteps are very clear. From <hi>dies,</hi> comes <hi>diurnus. Diu</hi> is, by inaccurate cars or inaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pronunciation, eaſily confounded with <hi>giu;</hi> then the Italians form a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive of the ablative of an adjective, and thence <hi>giurno,</hi> or, as they make it, <hi>giorno;</hi> which is readily contracted into <hi>giour,</hi> or <hi>jour."</hi>
                  </q> He obſerved, that the Bohemian language was true Sclavonick. The Swede ſaid, it had ſome
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0548300101:390"/>
ſimilarity with the German. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, to be ſure, ſuch parts  of Sclavonia as confine with Germany, will borrow German words; and ſuch parts as confine with Tartary, will borrow Tartar words."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, he never had it properly aſcertained that the Scotch Highlanders and the Iriſh underſtood each other. I told him that my couſin Colonel Graham, of the Royal Highlanders, whom I met at Drogheda, told me they did. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if the Highlanders underſtood Iriſh, why tranſlate the New Teſtament into Erſe, as was done lately at Edinburgh, when there is an Iriſh tranſlation?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Although the Erſe and Iriſh are both dialects of the ſame language, there may be a good deal of diverſity between them, as between the different dialects in Italy.</q>—The Swede went away, and Mr. Johnſon continued his reading of the papers. I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am afraid, Sir, it is troubleſome to you."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) I do not take much delight in it; but I'll go through it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We went to the Mitre, and dined in the room where he and I firſt ſupped together. He gave me great hopes of my cauſe. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) the government of a ſchoolmaſter is ſomewhat of the nature of military govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is to ſay, it muſt be arbitrary, it muſt be exerciſed by the will of one man, according to particular circumſtances. You muſt ſhew ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this occaſion. You muſt ſhew, that a ſchoolmaſter has a preſcriptive right to beat; and that an action of aſſault and battery cannot be admitted againſt him, unleſs there is ſome great exceſs, ſome barbarity. This man has maimed none of his boys. They are all left with the full exerciſe of their corporeal faculties. In our ſchools in England, many boys have been maimed; yet I never heard of an action againſt a ſchoolmaſter on that account. Puffendorf, I think, maintains the right of a ſchoolmaſter to beat his ſcholars."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, March 27, I introduced to him Sir Alexander Macdonald, with whom he had expreſſed a wiſh to be acquainted. He received him very courteouſly.</p>
               <p>Sir Alexander obſerved, that the Chancellors in England are choſen from views much inferiour to the office, being choſen from temporary political views. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, in ſuch a government as ours, no man is appointed to an office becauſe he is the fitteſt for it, nor hardly in any other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe there are ſo many connections and dependencies to be ſtudied. A deſpotick prince may chooſe a man to an office, merely becauſe he is the fitteſt for it. The King of Pruſſia may do it."</q> SIR A. <q rend="inline">"I think, Sir, almoſt all great lawyers, ſuch at leaſt as have written upon law, have known only law, and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0548300101:391"/>
 nothing elſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir; Judge Hale was a great lawyer, and wrote upon law; and yet he knew a great many other things, and has written upon other things. Selden too."</q> SIR A. <q rend="inline">"Very true, Sir; and Lord Bacon. But was not Lord Coke a mere lawyer?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, I am afraid he was; but he would have taken it very ill if you had told him ſo. He would have proſecuted you for ſcandal."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Lord Mansfield is not a mere lawyer."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. I never was in Lord Mansfield's company; but, Lord Mansfield was diſtinguiſhed at the Univerſity. Lord Mansfield, when he came firſt to town, 'drank champagne with the wits,' as Prior ſays. He was the friend of Pope."</q> SIR. A. <q rend="inline">"Barriſters, I believe, are not ſo abuſive now as they were formerly. I fancy they had leſs law long ago, and ſo were obliged to take to abuſe, to fill up the time. Now they have ſuch a number of precedents, they have no occaſion for abuſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, they had more law long ago than they have now. As to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, to be ſure they will increaſe in courſe of time; but the more prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there are, the leſs occaſion is there for law; that is to ſay, the leſs occaſion is there for inveſtigating principles."</q> SIR A. <q rend="inline">"I have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting ſeveral Scotch accents in my friend Boſwell. I doubt, Sir, if any Scotchman ever attains to a perfect Engliſh pronunciation."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, few of them do, becauſe they do not perſevere after acquiring a certain degree of it. But, Sir, there can be no doubt that they may attain to a perfect Engliſh pronunciation, if they will. We find how near they come to it; and certainly, a man who conquers nineteen parts of the Scottiſh accent, may conquer the twentieth. But, Sir, when a man has got the better of nine tenths, he grows weary, he relaxes his diligence, he finds he has corrected his accent ſo far as not to be diſagreeable, and he no longer deſires his friends to tell him when he is wrong; nor does he chooſe to be told. Sir, when people watch me narrowly, and I do not watch myſelf, they will find me out to be of a particular county. In the ſame manner, Dunning may be found out to be a Devonſhire man. So moſt Scotchmen may be found out. But, Sir, little aberrations are of no diſadvantage. I never catched Mallet in a Scotch accent; and yet Mallet, I ſuppoſe, was paſt five-and-twenty before he came to London."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon another occaſion I talked to him on this ſubject, having myſelf taken ſome pains to improve my pronunciation, by the aid of the late Mr. Love, of Drury-lane theatre, when he was a player at Edinburgh, and alſo of old Mr. Sheridan. Johnſon ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, your pronunciation is not offenſive."</q>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0548300101:392"/>
With this conceſſion I was pretty well ſatisfied; and let me give my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men  of North-Britain an advice not to aim at abſolute perfection in this reſpect; not to ſpeak <hi>High Engliſh,</hi> as we are apt to call what is far removed from the <hi>Scotch,</hi> but which is by no means good Engliſh, and makes <q rend="inline">"the fools who uſe it,"</q> truly ridiculous. Good Engliſh is plain, eaſy, and ſmooth in the mouth of an unaffected Engliſh gentleman. A ſtudied and factitious pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, which requires perpetual attention, and impoſes perpetual conſtraint, is exceedingly diſguſting. A ſmall intermixture of provincial peculiarities may, perhaps, have an agreeable effect, as the notes of different birds concur in the harmony of the grove, and pleaſe more than if they were all exactly alike. I could name ſome gentlemen of Ireland, to whom a ſlight proportion of the accent and recitative of that country is an advantage. The ſame obſervation will apply to the gentlemen of Scotland. I do not mean that we ſhould ſpeak as broad as a certain proſperous member of parliament from that country; though it has been well obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"it has been of no ſmall uſe to him; as it rouſes the attention of the Houſe by its uncommonneſs; and is equal to tropes and figures in a good Engliſh ſpeaker."</q> I would give as an inſtance of what I mean to recommend to my countrymen, the pronunciation of the late Sir Gilbert Elliot; and may I preſume to add that of the preſent Earl of Marchmont, who told me, with great good humour, that the maſter of a ſhop in London, where he was not known, ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe, Sir, you are an American."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why ſo, Sir,"</q> (ſaid his Lordſhip.) <q rend="inline">"Becauſe, Sir, (replied the ſhopkeeper,) you ſpeak neither Engliſh nor Scotch, but ſomething different from both, which I conclude is the language of America."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It may be of uſe, Sir, to have a Dictionary to aſcertain the pronunciation."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, my Dictionary ſhews you the accents of words, if you can but remember them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, we want marks to aſcertain the pronunciation of the vowels. Sheridan, I believe, has finiſhed ſuch a work."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, conſider how much eaſier it is to learn a language by the ear, than by any marks. Sheridan's Dictionary may do very well; but you cannot always carry it about with you: and, when you want the word, you have not the Dictionary. It is like a man who has a ſword that will not draw. It is an admirable ſword, to be ſure: but while your enemy is cutting your throat, you are unable to uſe it. Beſides, Sir, what entitles Sheridan to fix the pronunciation of Engliſh? He has, in the firſt place, the diſadvantage of being an Iriſhman: and if he ſays he will
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0548300101:393" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 fix it after the example of the beſt company, why they differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I remember an inſtance: when I publiſhed the Plan for my Dictionary, Lord Cheſterfield told me that the word <hi>great</hi> ſhould be pronounced ſo as to rhyme to <hi>ſtate;</hi> and Sir William Young ſent me word that it ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſo as to rhyme to <hi>ſeat,</hi> and that none but an Iriſhman would pronounce it <hi>grait.</hi> Now here were two men of the higheſt rank, the one, the beſt ſpeaker in the Houſe of Lords, the other, the beſt ſpeaker in the Houſe of Commons, differing entirely."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I again viſited him at night. Finding him in a very good humour, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to lead him to the ſubject of our ſituation in a future ſtate, having much curioſity to know his notions on that point. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of an unembodied ſpirit will conſiſt in a conſciouſneſs of the favour of GOD, in the contemplation of truth, and in the poſſeſſion of felicitating ideas."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, is there any harm in our forming to ourſelves conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as to the particulars of our happineſs, though the ſcripture has ſaid but very little on the ſubject? 'We know not what we ſhall be."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is no harm. What philoſophy ſuggeſts to us on this topick is probable: what ſcripture tells us is certain. Dr. Henry More has carried it as far as philoſophy can. You may buy both his theological and philoſophical works in two volumes folio, for about eight ſhillings."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"One of the moſt pleaſing thoughts is, that we ſhall ſee our friends again."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but you muſt conſider, that when we are become purely rational, many of our friendſhips will be cut off. Many friendſhips are formed by a community of ſenſual pleaſures: all theſe will be cut off. We form many friendſhips with bad men, becauſe they have agreeable qualities, and they can be uſeful to us; but, after death, they can no longer be of uſe to us. We form many friendſhips by miſtake, imagining people to be different from what they really are. After death, we ſhall ſee every one in a true light. Then, Sir, they talk of our meeting our relations: but then all relationſhip is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and we ſhall have no regard for one perſon more than another, but for their real value. However, we ſhall either have the ſatisfaction of meeting our friends, or be ſatisfied without meeting them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet, Sir, we ſee in ſcripture that Dives ſtill retained an anxious concern about his brethren."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, we muſt either ſuppoſe that paſſage to be metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, or hold with many divines, and all the Purgatorians, that departed ſouls do not all at once arrive at the utmoſt perfection of which they are capable."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I think, Sir, that is a very rational ſuppoſition."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but we do not know it is a true one. There is no harm in
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0548300101:394" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believing it: but you muſt not compel others to make it an article of faith,  for it is not revealed."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Do you think, Sir, it is wrong in a man who holds the doctrine of purgatory, to pray for the ſouls of his deceaſed friends?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I have been told, that in the liturgy of the Epiſcopal Church of Scotland, there was a form of prayer for the dead."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is not in the liturgy which Laud framed for the Epiſcopal Church of Scotland: if there is a liturgy older than that, I ſhould be glad to ſee it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"As to our employment in a future ſtate, the ſacred writings ſay little. The Revelation, however, of St. John gives us many ideas, and particularly mentions muſick."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, ideas muſt be given you by means of ſomething which you know: and as to muſick, there are ſome philoſophers and divines who have maintained that we ſhall not be ſpiritualiſed to ſuch a degree, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of matter, very much refined, will remain. In that caſe, muſick may make a part of our future felicity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I do not know whether there are any well-atteſted ſtories of the appearance of ghoſts. You know there is a famous ſtory of the appearance of Mrs. Veal, prefixed to 'Drelincourt on Death."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir, that is given up. I believe the woman declared upon her death-bed that it was a lie."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"This objection is made againſt the truth of ghoſts appearing: that if they are in a ſtate of happineſs, it would be a puniſhment to them to return to this world; and if they are in a ſtate of miſery, it would be giving them a reſpite."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as the happineſs or miſery of unembodied ſpirits does not depend upon place, but is intellectual, we cannot ſay that they are leſs happy or leſs miſerable by appearing upon earth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We went down between twelve and one to Mrs. William's room, and drank tea. I mentioned that we were to have the remains of Mr. Gray, in proſe and verſe, publiſhed by Mr. Maſon. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think we have had enough of Gray. I ſee they have publiſhed a ſplendid edition of Akenſide's works. One bad Ode may be ſuffered, but a number of them together makes one ſick."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Akenſide's diſtinguiſhed poem is his 'Pleaſures of the Imagination:' but, for my part, I never could admire it ſo much as moſt people do."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I could not read it through."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I have read it through; but I did not find any great power in it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Elwal, the heretick, whoſe trial Sir John Pringle had given me to read. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, Mr. Elwal was, I think, an ironmonger at Wolverhampton; and he had a mind to make himſelf famous, by being the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0548300101:395" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 founder of a new ſect, which he wiſhed much ſhould be called <hi>Elwallians.</hi> He held, that every thing in the Old Teſtament that was not typical, was to be of perpetual obſervance; and ſo he wore a ribband in the plaits of his coat, and he alſo wore a beard. I remember I had the honour of dining in company with Mr. Elwal. There was one Barter, a miller, who wrote againſt him; and ſo you had 'The Controverſy between Mr. ELWAL and Mr. BARTER.' To try to make himſelf diſtinguiſhed, he wrote a letter to King George the Second, challenging him to diſpute with him, in which he ſaid, 'George, if you be afraid to come by yourſelf, to diſpute with a poor old man, you may bring a thouſand of your <hi>black</hi>-guards with you; and if you ſhould ſtill be afraid, you may bring a thouſand of your <hi>red</hi>-guards.' The letter had ſomething of the impudence of Junius to our preſent King. But the men of Wolverhampton were not ſo inflammable as the Common Council of London; ſo Mr. Elwal failed in his ſcheme of making himſelf a man of great conſequence."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, March 31, he and I dined at General Paoli's. A queſtion was ſtarted, whether the ſtate of marriage was natural to man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is ſo far from being natural for a man and woman to live in a ſtate of marriage, that we find all the motives which they have for remaining in that connection, and the reſtraints which civiliſed ſociety impoſes to prevent ſeparation, are hardly ſufficient to keep them together."</q> The General ſaid, that in a ſtate of nature a man and woman uniting together would form a ſtrong and conſtant affection, by the mutual pleaſure each would receive; and that the ſame cauſes of diſſention would not ariſe between them, as occur between huſband and wife in a civiliſed ſtate. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they would have diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enough, though of another kind. One would chooſe to go a hunting in this wood, the other in that; one would chooſe to go a fiſhing in this lake, the other in that; or, perhaps, one would chooſe to go a hunting, when the other would chooſe to go a fiſhing; and ſo they would part. Beſides, Sir, a ſavage man and a ſavage woman meet by chance; and when the man ſees another woman that pleaſes him better, he will leave the firſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We then fell into a diſquiſition whether there is any beauty independent of utility. The General maintained there was not. Dr. Johnſon maintained that there was; and he inſtanced a coffee-cup which he held in his hand, the painting of which was of no real uſe, as the cup would hold the coffee equally well if plain; yet the painting was beautiful.</p>
               <p>We talked of the ſtrange cuſtom of ſwearing in converſation. The Genera ſaid, that all barbarous nations ſwore from a certain violence of temper, that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0548300101:396" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not be confined to earth, but was always reaching at the powers  above. He ſaid, too, that there was greater variety of ſwearing, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as there was a greater variety of religious ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon went home with me to my lodgings in Conduit-ſtreet and drank tea, previous to our going to the Pantheon, which neither of us had ſeen before.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Goldſmith's Life of Parnell is poor; not that it is poorly written, but that he had poor materials: for nobody can write the life of a man, but thoſe who have eat and drunk and lived in ſocial intercourſe with him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid, that if it was not troubleſome and preſuming too much, I would requeſt him to tell me all the little circumſtances of his life; what ſchools he attended, when he came to Oxford, when he came to London, &amp;c. &amp;c. He did not diſapprove of my curioſity as to theſe particulars; but ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They'll come out by degrees as we talk together."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He cenſured Ruffhead's Life of Pope; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he knew nothing of Pope, and nothing of poetry."</q> He praiſed Dr. Joſeph Warton's Eſſay on Pope; but ſaid, he ſuppoſed we ſhould have no more of it, as the authour had not been able to perſuade the world to think of Pope as he did. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, ſhould that prevent him from continuing his work? He is an ingenious Counſel, who has made the moſt of his cauſe: he is not obliged to gain it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, there is a difference when the cauſe is of a man's own making."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the proper uſe of riches. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"If I were a man of a great eſtate, I would drive all the raſcals whom I did not like out of the county at an election."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I aſked him how far he thought wealth ſhould be employed in hoſpitality. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are to conſider that ancient hoſpitality, of which we hear ſo much, was in an uncommercial country, when men being idle, were glad to be entertained at rich men's tables. But in a commercial country, a buſy country, time becomes precious, and therefore hoſpitality is not ſo much valued. No doubt there is ſtill room for a certain degree of it; and a man has a ſatisfaction in ſeeing his friends eating and drinking around him. But promiſcuous hoſpitality is not the way to gain real influence. You muſt help ſome people at table before others; you muſt aſk ſome people how they like their wine oftener than others. You therefore offend more people than you pleaſe. You are like the French ſtateſman, who ſaid, when he granted a favour, <hi>'J'at fait dix mécontens et un ingrat.'</hi> Beſides, Sir, being entertained ever ſo well at a man's table, impreſſes no laſting regard or eſteem. No,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0548300101:397" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Sir, the way to make ſure of power and influence is, by lending money confidentially to your neighbours at a ſmall intereſt, or, perhaps, at no intereſt at all, and having their bonds in your poſſeſſion."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"May not a man, Sir, employ his riches to advantage in educating young men of merit?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, if they fall in your way; but if it is underſtood that you patroniſe young men of merit, you will be harraſſed with ſolicitations. You will have numbers forced upon you who have no merit; ſome will force them upon you from miſtaken partiality; and ſome from downright intereſted motives, without ſcruple; and you will be diſgraced.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Were I a rich man, I would propagate all kinds of trees that will grow in the open air. A green-houſe is childiſh. I would introduce foreign animals into the country; for inſtance, the rein-deer <note n="2" place="bottom">This project has ſince been realiſed. Sir Henry Liddel, who made a ſpirited tour into Lapland, brought two rein-deer to his eſtate in Northumberland, where they bred; but the race has unfortunately periſhed.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation now turned on critical ſubjects. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Bayes, in 'The Rehearſal,' is a mighty ſilly character. If it was intended to be like a particular man, it could only be diverting while that man was remembered. But I queſtion whether it was meant for Dryden, as has been reported; for we know ſome of the paſſages ſaid to be ridiculed, were written ſince the Rehearſal; at leaſt a paſſage mentioned in the Preface is of a later date."</q> I maintained that it had merit as a general ſatire on the ſelf-importance of dramatick authours. But even in this light he held it very cheap.</p>
               <p>We then walked to the Pantheon. The firſt view of it did not ſtrike us ſo much as Ranelagh, of which he ſaid, the <hi>coup d'oeil</hi> was the fineſt thing he had ever ſeen. The truth is, Ranelagh is of a more beautiful form; more of it, or rather indeed the whole <hi>rotunda,</hi> appears at once, and it is better lighted. However, as Johnſon obſerved, we ſaw the Pantheon in time of mourning, when there was a dull uniformity; whereas we had ſeen Ranelagh when the view was enlivened with a gay profuſion of colours. Mrs. Boſville, of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwait, in Yorkſhire, joined us, and entered into converſation with us. Johnſon ſaid to me afterwards, <q rend="inline">"Sir, this is a mighty intelligent lady."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid there was not half a guinea's worth of pleaſure in ſeeing this place. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, there is half a guinea's worth of inferiority to other people in not having ſeen it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I doubt, Sir, whether there are many happy people here."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, there are many happy people here. There are many people here who are watching hundreds, and who think hundreds are watching them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0548300101:398" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Happening to meet Sir Adam Ferguſſon, I preſented him to Dr. Johnſon.  Sir Adam expreſſed ſome apprehenſion that the Pantheon would encourage luxury. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) I am a great friend to publick amuſements; for they keep people from vice. You now (addreſſing himſelf to me,) would have been with a wench, had you not been here. O! I forgot you were married."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Adam ſuggeſted, that luxury corrupts a people, and deſtroys the ſpirit of liberty. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that is all viſionary. I would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another. It is of no moment to the happineſs of an individual. Sir, the danger of the abuſe of power is nothing to a private man. What Frenchman is prevented from paſſing his life as he pleaſes?"</q> SIR ADAM. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, in the Britiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution it is ſurely of importance to keep up a ſpirit in the people, ſo as to preſerve a balance againſt the crown."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I perceive you are a vile Whig.—Why all this childiſh jealouſy of the power of the crown? The crown has not power enough. When I ſay that all governments are alike, I conſider that in no government power can be abuſed long. Mankind will not bear it. If a ſovereign oppreſſes his people to a great degree, they will riſe and cut off his head. There is a remedy in human nature againſt tyranny, that will keep us ſafe under every form of government. Had not the people of France thought themſelves honoured as ſharing in the brilliant actions of the reign of Lewis XIV. they would not have endured him; and we may ſay the ſame of the King of Pruſſia's people."</q> Sir Adam introduced the ancient Greeks and Romans. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the maſs of both of them were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. The maſs of every people muſt be barbarous where there is no printing, and conſequently knowledge is not generally diffuſed. Knowledge is diffuſed among our people by the newſpapers."</q> Sir Adam mentioned the orators, poets, and artiſts of Greece. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I am talking of the maſs of the people. We ſee even what the boaſted Athenians were. The little effect which Demoſthenes's orations had upon them, ſhews that they were barbarians."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Adam was unlucky in his topicks; for he ſuggeſted a doubt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Biſhops having ſeats in the Houſe of Lords. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"How ſo, Sir? Who is more proper for having the dignity of a peer, than a Biſhop, provided a Biſhop be what he ought to be; and if improper Biſhops be made, that is not the fault of the Biſhops, but of thoſe who make them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 5, after attending divine ſervice at St. Paul's church, I found him alone. Of a ſchoolmaſter of his acquaintance, a native of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0548300101:399" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He has a great deal of good about him; but he is alſo very defective in ſome reſpects. His inner part is good, but his outer part is mighty aukward. You in Scotland do not attain that nice critical ſkill in languages, which we get in our ſchools in England. I would not put a boy to him, whom I intended for a man of learning. But for the ſons of citizens, who are to learn a little, get good morals, and then go to trade, he may do very well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned a cauſe in which I had appeared as counſel at the bar of the General Aſſembly of the Church of Scotland, where a <hi>Probationer,</hi> (as one licenſed to preach, but not yet ordained, is called,) was oppoſed in his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be inducted, becauſe it was alledged that he had been guilty of fornication five years before. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, if he has repented, it is not a ſufficient objection. A man who is good enough to go to heaven, is good enough to be a clergyman."</q> This was a humane and liberal ſentiment. But the character of a clergyman is more ſacred than that of an ordinary Chriſtian. As he is to inſtruct with authority, he ſhould be regarded with reverence, as one upon whom divine truth has had the effect to ſet him above ſuch tranſgreſſions, as men leſs exalted by ſpiritual habits, and yet upon the whole not to be excluded from heaven, have been betrayed into by the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance of paſſion. That clergymen may be conſidered as ſinners in general, as all men are, cannot be denied; but this reflection will not counteract their good precepts ſo much, as the abſolute knowledge of their having been guilty of certain ſpecifick immoral acts. I told him, that by the rules of the Church of Scotland, in their <q rend="inline">"Book of Diſcipline,"</q> if a <hi>ſcandal,</hi> as it is called, is not proſecuted for five years, it cannot afterwards be proceeded upon, <q rend="inline">"unleſs it be <hi>of a heinous nature,</hi> or again become flagrant;"</q> and that hence a queſtion aroſe, whether fornication was a ſin of a heinous nature; and that I had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that it did not deſerve that epithet, in as much as it was not one of thoſe ſins which argue very great depravity of heart: in ſhort, was not, in the general acceptation of mankind, a heinous ſin. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, it is not a heinous ſin. A heinous ſin is that for which a man is puniſhed with death or baniſhment."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, after I had argued that it was not a heinous ſin, an old clergyman roſe up, and repeating the text of ſcripture denouncing judgement againſt whoremongers, aſked, whether, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this, there could be any doubt of fornication being a heinous ſin.</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, obſerve the word <hi>whoremonger.</hi> Every ſin, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in, will become heinous. Whoremonger is a dealer in whores, as ironmonger is a dealer in iron. But as you don't call a man an ironmonger for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0548300101:400" rendition="simple:additions"/>
buying and ſelling a pen-knife; ſo you don't call a man a whoremonger for  getting one wench with child."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpoke of the inequality of the livings of the clergy in England, and the ſcanty proviſions of ſome of the Curates. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Sir; but it cannot be helped. You muſt conſider, that the revenues of the clergy are not at the diſpoſal of the ſtate, like the pay of the army. Different men have founded different churches; and ſome are better endowed, ſome worſe. The State cannot interfere and make an equal diviſion of what has been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly appropriated. Now when a clergyman has but a ſmall living, or even two ſmall livings, he can afford very little to a Curate."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, he went more frequently to church when there were prayers only, than when there was alſo a ſermon, as the people required more an example for the one than the other; it being much eaſier for them to hear a ſermon, than to fix their minds on prayer.</p>
               <p>On Monday, April 6, I dined with him at Sir Alexander Macdonald's, where was a young officer in the regimentals of the Scots Royal, who talked with a vivacity, fluency, and preciſion ſo uncommon, that he attracted parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attention. He proved to be the Honourable Thomas Erſkine, youngeſt brother to the Earl of Buchan, who has ſince riſen into ſuch brilliant repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at the bar in Weſtminſter-hall.</p>
               <p>Fielding being mentioned, Johnſon exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"he was a blockhead;"</q> and upon my expreſſing my aſtoniſhment at ſo ſtrange an aſſertion, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What I mean by his being a blockhead is, that he was a barren raſcal."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Will you not allow, Sir, that he draws very natural pictures of human life?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is of very low life. Richardſon uſed to ſay, that had he not known who Fielding was, he ſhould have believed he was an oſtler. Sir, there is more knowledge of the heart in one letter of Richardſon's, than in all 'Tom Jones.' I, indeed, never read 'Joſeph Andrews."</q> ERSKINE. <q rend="inline">"Surely, Sir, Richardſon is very tedious."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, if you were to read Richardſon for the ſtory, your impatience would be ſo much fretted, that you would hang yourſelf. But you muſt read him for the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſider the ſtory as only giving occaſion to the ſentiment."</q>—I have already given my opinion of Fielding; but I cannot refrain from repeating here my wonder at Johnſon's exceſſive and unaccountable depreciation of one of the beſt writers that England has produced. <q rend="inline">"Tom Jones"</q> has ſtood the teſt of publick opinion with ſuch ſucceſs, as to have eſtabliſhed its great merit, both for the ſtory, the ſentiments, and the manners, and alſo the varieties of diction, ſo as to leave no doubt of its having an animated truth of execution throughout.</p>

                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0548300101:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 A book of travels, lately publiſhed under the title of <hi>Coriat Junior,</hi> and written by Mr. Paterſon, the auctioneer, was mentioned. Johnſon ſaid, this book was an imitation of Sterne, and not of Coriat, whoſe name Paterſon had choſen as a whimſical one. <q rend="inline">"Tom Coriat, (ſaid he,) was a humouriſt about the court of James the Firſt. He had a mixture of learning, of wit, and of buffoonery. He firſt travelled through Europe, and publiſhed his travels. He afterwards travelled on foot through Aſia, and had made many remarks; but he died at Mandoa, and his remarks were loſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of gaming, and animadverted on it with ſeverity. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, gentlemen, let us not aggravate the matter. It is not roguery to play with a man who is ignorant of the game, while you are maſter of it, and ſo win his money; for he thinks he can play better than you, as you think you can play better than he; and the ſuperiour ſkill carries it."</q> ERSKINE. <q rend="inline">"He is a fool, but you are not a rogue."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That's much about the truth, Sir. It muſt be conſidered, that a man who only does what every one of the ſociety to which he belongs would do, is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt man. In the republick of Sparta it was agreed, that ſtealing was not diſhonourable, if not diſcovered. I do not commend a ſociety where there is an agreement that what would not otherwiſe be fair, ſhall be fair; but I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that an individual of any ſociety, who practiſes what is allowed, is not a diſhoneſt man."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So then, Sir, you do not think ill of a man who wins perhaps forty thouſand pounds in a winter?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I do not call a gameſter a diſhoneſt man; but I call him an unſocial man, an unprofitable man. Gaming is a mode of transferring property without producing any intermediate good. Trade gives employment to numbers, and ſo produces intermediate good."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Erſkine told us, that when he was in the iſland of Minorca, he not only read prayers, but preached two ſermons to the regiment. He ſeemed to object to the paſſage in ſcripture where we are told that the angel of the Lord ſmote in one night forty thouſand Aſſyrians. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) you ſhould recollect that there was a ſupernatural interpoſition; they were deſtroyed by peſtilence. You are not to ſuppoſe that the angel of the Lord went about and ſtabbed each of them with a dagger, or knocked them on the head, man by man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>After Mr. Erſkine was gone, a diſcuſſion took place, whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Earl of Buchan, when Lord Cardroſs, did right to refuſe to go Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Embaſſy to Spain, when Sir James Gray, a man of inferiour rank, went Ambaſſadour. Dr. Johnſon ſaid, that perhaps in point of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0548300101:402" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intereſt he did wrong; but in point of dignity he did well. Sir Alexander inſiſted that he was wrong, and ſaid that Mr. Pitt intended it as an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous thing for him. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) Mr. Pitt might think it an advantageous thing for him to make him a vintner, and get him all the Portugal trade; but he would have demeaned himſelf ſtrangely had he accepted of ſuch a ſituation. Sir, had he gone Secretary while his inferiour was Ambaſſadour, he would have been a traitor to his rank and family."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked of the little attachment which ſubſiſted between near relations in London. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) in a country ſo commercial as ours, where every man can do for himſelf, there is not ſo much occaſion for that attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No man is thought the worſe of here, whoſe brother was hanged. In uncommercial countries, many of the branches of a family muſt depend on the ſtock; ſo, in order to make the head of the family take care of them, they are repreſented as connected with his reputation, that, ſelf-love being inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, he may exert himſelf to promote their intereſt. You have firſt large circles, or clans; as commerce increaſes, the connection is confined to families. By degrees, that too goes off, as having become unneceſſary, and there being few opportunities of intercourſe. One brother is a merchant in the city, and another is an officer in the guards. How little intercourſe can theſe two have!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I argued warmly for the old ſeudal ſyſtem. Sir Alexander oppoſed it, and talked of the pleaſure of ſeeing all men free and independent. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I agree with Mr. Boſwell that there muſt be a high ſatisfaction in being a feudal Lord; but we are to conſider, that we ought not to wiſh to have a number of men unhappy for the ſatisfaction of one."</q>—I maintained that numbers, namely, the vaſſals or followers, were not unhappy, for that there was a reciprocal ſatisfaction between the Lord and them: he being kind in his authority over them; they being reſpectful and faithful to him.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 9, I called on him to beg he would go and dine with me at the Mitre tavern. He had reſolved not to dine at all this day, I know not for what reaſon; and I was ſo unwilling to be deprived of his company, that I was content to ſubmit to ſuffer a want, which was at firſt ſomewhat painful, but he ſoon made me forget it; and a man is always pleaſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he finds his intellectual inclinations predominate.</p>
               <p>He obſerved, that to reaſon too philoſophically on the nature of prayer, was very unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Talking of ghoſts, he ſaid, he knew one friend, who was an honeſt man and a ſenſible man, who told him he had ſeen a ghoſt, old Mr. Edward

 Cave, the printer at St. John's Gate. He ſaid, Mr. Cave did not like to talk of it, but ſeemed to be in great horrour whenever it was mentioned. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, what did he ſay was the appearance?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, ſomething of a ſhadowy being."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned witches, and aſked him what they properly meant. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, they properly mean thoſe who make uſe of the aid of evil ſpirits."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There is no doubt, Sir, a general report and belief of their having exiſted,"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have not only the general report and belief, but you have many voluntary ſolemn confeſſions."</q> He did not affirm any thing poſitively upon a ſubject which it is the faſhion of the times to laugh at as a matter of abſurd credulity. He only ſeemed willing, as a candid enquirer after truth, however ſtrange and inexplicable, to ſhew that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what might be urged for it <note n="3" place="bottom">See this curious queſtion treated by him with moſt acute ability, <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> 3d edit. p. 33.</note>.</p>
               <p>On Friday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, where we found Dr. Goldſmith.</p>
               <p>Armorial bearings having been mentioned, Johnſon ſaid, they were as ancient as the ſiege of Thebes, which he proved by a paſſage in one of the tragedies of Euripides.</p>
               <p>I ſtarted the queſtion whether duelling was conſiſtent with moral duty. The brave old General fired at this, and ſaid, with a lofty air, <q rend="inline">"Undoubtedly a man has a right to defend his honour."</q> GOLDSMITH, (turning to me.) <q rend="inline">"I aſk you firſt, Sir, what you would do if you were affronted?"</q> I anſwered I ſhould think it neceſſary to fight. <q rend="inline">"Why then (replied Goldſmith,) that ſolves the queſtion."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, it does not ſolve the queſtion. It does not follow that what a man would do is therefore right."</q> I ſaid, I wiſhed to have it ſettled, whether duelling was contrary to the laws of Chriſtianity. Johnſon immediately entered on the ſubject, and treated it in a maſterly manner; and ſo far as I have been able to recollect, his thoughts were theſe: <q rend="inline">"Sir, as men become in a high degree refined, various cauſes of offence ariſe; which are conſidered to be of ſuch importance, that life muſt be ſtaked to atone for them, though in reality they are not ſo. A body that has received a very fine poliſh may be eaſily hurt. Before men arrive at this artificial refinement, if one tells his neighbour he lies, his neighbour tells him he lies; if one gives his neighbour a blow, his neighbour gives him a blow: but in a ſtate of highly poliſhed ſociety, an affront is held to be a ſerious injury. It muſt,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0548300101:404" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore, be reſented, or rather a duel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be fought upon it; as men have agreed to baniſh from their ſociety one who puts up with an affront without fighting a duel. Now, Sir, it is never unlawful to fight in ſelf-defence. He, then, who fights a duel, does not fight from paſſion againſt his antagoniſt, but out of ſelf-defence; to avert the ſtigma of the world, and to prevent himſelf from being driven out of ſociety. I could wiſh that there was not that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of refinement; but while ſuch notions prevail, no doubt a man may lawfully fight a duel."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be remembered, that this juſtification is applicable only to the perſon who <hi>receives</hi> an affront. All mankind muſt condemn the aggreſſor.</p>
               <p>The General told us, that when he was a very young man, I think only fifteen, ſerving under Prince Eugene of Savoy, he was ſitting in a company at table with a Prince of Wirtemberg. The Prince took up a glaſs of wine, and, by a fillip, made ſome of it fly in Oglethorpe's face. Here was a nice dilemma. To have challenged him inſtantly, might have fixed a quarrelſome character upon the young ſoldier: to have taken no notice of it might have been conſidered as cowardice. Oglethorpe, therefore, keeping his eye upon the Prince, and ſmiling all the time, as if he took what his Highneſs had done in jeſt, ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Mon Prince,</hi>—"</q> (I forget the French words he uſed, the purport however was,) <q rend="inline">"That's a good joke; but we do it much better in England;"</q> and threw a whole glaſs of wine in the Prince's face. An old General who ſat by, ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"I'l a bien fait, mon Prince, vous l'avez commencé;"</hi>
                  </q> and thus all ended in good humour.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Pray, General, give us an account of the ſiege of Bender."</q> Upon which the General, pouring a little wine upon the table, deſcribed every thing with a wet finger: <q rend="inline">"Here were we, here were the Turks,"</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. Johnſon liſtened with the cloſeſt attention.</p>
               <p>A queſtion was ſtarted, how far people who diſagree in any capital point can live in friendſhip together. Johnſon ſaid they might. Goldſmith ſaid they could not, as they had not the <hi>idem velle atque idem nolle</hi>—the ſame likings and the ſame averſions. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you muſt ſhun the ſubject as to which you diſagree. For inſtance, I can live very well with Burke: I love his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, his genius, his diffuſion, and affluence of converſation; but I would not talk to him of the Rockingham party."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, when people live together who have ſomething as to which they diſagree, and which they want to ſhun, they will be in the ſituation mentioned in the ſtory of Bluebeard; 'You may look into all the chambers but one.' But we ſhould have the greateſt inclination to look into that chamber, to talk of that ſubject."</q> JOHNSON,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0548300101:405" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>Goldſmith told us, that he was now buſy in writing a natural hiſtory, and, that he might have full leiſure for it, he had taken lodgings at a farmer's houſe, near to the ſix mile-ſtone, on the Edgeware-road, and had carried down his books in two returned poſt-chaiſes. He ſaid, he believed the farmer's family thought him an odd character, ſimilar to that in which the <hi>Spectator</hi> appeared to his landlady and children: he was <hi>The Gentleman.</hi> Mr. Mickle, the tranſlator of <q rend="inline">"The Luſiad,"</q> and I, went to viſit him at this place a few days afterwards. He was not at home; but having a curioſity to ſee his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we went in and found curious ſcraps of deſcriptions of animals, ſcrawled upon the walls with a black lead pencil.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of ghoſts having been introduced, Johnſon repeated what he had told me of a friend of his, an honeſt man and a man of ſenſe, having aſſerted to him that he had ſeen an apparition. Goldſmith told us, he was aſſured by his brother, the Reverend Mr. Goldſmith, that he alſo had ſeen one. General Oglethorpe told us, that Pendergraſt, an officer in the Duke of Marlborough's army, had mentioned to many of his friends that he ſhould die on a particular day. That upon that day a battle took place with the French; that after it was over, and Pendergraſt was ſtill alive, his brother officers, while they were yet in the field, jeſtingly aſked him where was his prophecy now. Pendergraſt gravely anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I ſhall die, notwithſtanding what you ſee."</q> Soon afterwards there came a ſhot from a French battery, to which the orders for a ceſſation of arms had not yet reached, and he was killed upon the ſpot. Colonel Cecil, who took poſſeſſion of his effects, found in his pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book the following ſolemn entry:</p>
               <p>[Here the date.] <q rend="inline">"Dreamt—or—<note n="4" place="bottom">Here was a blank, which may be ſilled up thus:—<q rend="inline">

                        </q>—the writer being probably uncertain whether he was aſleep or awake when his mind was impreſſed with the ſolemn preſentiment with which the fact afterwards happened ſo wonderfully to correſpond.</note> Sir John Friend meets me:"</q> (here the very day on which he was killed was mentioned.) Pendergraſt had been a witneſs againſt Sir John Friend, who was executed for high treaſon. General Oglethorpe ſaid, he was in company with Colonel Cecil when Pope came and enquired into the truth of this ſtory, which made a great noiſe at the time, and was then confirmed by the Colonel.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, April 11, he appointed me to come to him in the evening, when he ſaid he ſhould be at leiſure to give me ſome aſſiſtance for the defence
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0548300101:406"/>
of Haſtie, the ſchoolmaſter of Campbelltown, for whom I was to appear in the Houſe of Lords. When I came, I found him unwilling to exert himſelf. I preſſed him to write down his thoughts upon the ſubject. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"There's no occaſion for my writing. I'll talk to you."</q> He was, however, at laſt prevailed on to dictate to me, while I wrote as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The charge is, that he has uſed immoderate and cruel correction. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in itſelf, is not cruel; children, being not reaſonable, can be governed only by fear. To impreſs this fear, is therefore one of the firſt duties of thoſe who have the care of children. It is the duty of a parent; and has never been thought inconſiſtent with parental tenderneſs. It is the duty of a maſter, who is in his higheſt exaltation when he is <hi>loco parentis.</hi> Yet, as good things become evil by exceſs, correction, by being immoderate, may become cruel. But when is correction immoderate? When it is more frequent or more ſevere than is required <hi>ad monendum et docendum,</hi> for reformation and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No ſeverity is cruel which obſtinacy makes neceſſary; for the greateſt cruelty would be to deſiſt, and leave the ſcholar too careleſs for inſtruction, and too much hardened for reproof. Locke, in his treatiſe of Education, mentions a mother, with applauſe, who whipped an infant eight times before ſhe had ſubdued it; for had ſhe ſtopped at the ſeventh act of correction, her daughter, ſays he, would have been ruined. The degrees of obſtinacy in young minds are very different; as different muſt be the degrees of perſevering ſeverity. A ſtubborn ſcholar muſt be corrected till he is ſubdued. The diſcipline of a ſchool is military. There muſt be either unbounded licence or abſolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The maſter who puniſhes, not only conſults the future happineſs of him who is the immediate ſubject of correction; but he propagates obedience through the whole ſchool, and eſtabliſhes regularity by exemplary juſtice. The victorious obſtinacy of a ſingle boy would make his future endeavours of reformation or inſtruction totally ineffectual. Obſtinacy, therefore, muſt never be victorious. Yet, it is well known, that there ſometimes occurs a fullen and hardy reſolution, that laughs at all common puniſhment, and bids defiance to all common degrees of pain. Correction muſt be proportioned to occaſions. The flexible will be reformed by gentle diſcipline, and the refractory muſt be ſubdued by harſher methods. The degrees of ſcholaſtick, as of military puniſhment, no ſtated rules can aſcertain. It muſt be enforced till it overpowers temptation; till ſtubbornneſs becomes ſlexible, and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs regular. Cuſtom and reaſon have, indeed, ſet ſome bounds to ſcholaſtick penalties. The ſchoolmaſter inflicts no capital puniſhments; nor enforces his edicts by either death or mutilation. The civil law has wiſely determined,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0548300101:407"/>
 that a maſter who ſtrikes at a ſcholar's eye ſhall be conſidered as criminal. But puniſhments, however ſevere, that produce no laſting evil, may be juſt and reaſonable, becauſe they may be neceſſary. Such have been the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed by the reſpondent. No ſcholar has gone from him either blind or lame, or with any of his limbs or powers injured or impaired. They were irregular, and he puniſhed them: they were obſtinate, and he enforced his puniſhment. But, however provoked, he never exceeded the limits of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for he inflicted nothing beyond preſent pain; and how much of that was required, no man is ſo little able to determine as thoſe who have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined againſt him;—the parents of the offenders.—It has been ſaid, that he uſed unprecedented and improper inſtruments of correction. Of this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the meaning is not very eaſy to be found. No inſtrument of correction is more proper than another, but as it is better adapted to produce preſent pain without laſting miſchief. Whatever were his inſtruments, no laſting miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief has enſued; and therefore, however unuſual, in hands ſo cautious they were proper.—It has been objected, that the reſpondent admits the charge of cruelty, by producing no evidence to confute it. Let it be conſidered, that his ſcholars are either diſperſed at large in the world, or continue to inhabit the place in which they were bred. Thoſe who are diſperſed cannot be found: thoſe who remain are the ſons of his perſecutors, and are not likely to ſupport a man to whom their fathers are enemies. If it be ſuppoſed that the enmity of their fathers proves the juſtice of the charge, it muſt be conſidered how often experience ſhews us, that men who are angry on one ground will accuſe on another; with how little kindneſs, in a town of low trade, a man who lives by learning is regarded; and how implicitly, where the inhabitants are not very rich, a rich man is hearkened to and followed. In a place like Campbell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town it is eaſy for one of the principal inhabitants to make a party. It is eaſy for that party to heat themſelves with imaginary grievances. It is eaſy for them to oppreſs a man poorer than themſelves; and natural to aſſert the dignity of riches, by perſiſting in oppreſſion. The argument which attempts to prove the impropriety of reſtoring him to his ſchool, by alledging that he has loſt the confidence of the people, is not the ſubject of juridical conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he is to ſuffer, if he muſt ſuffer, not for their judgement, but for his own actions. It may be convenient for them to have another maſter; but it is a convenience of their own making. It would be likewiſe convenient for him to find another ſchool; but this convenience he cannot obtain.—The queſtion is not what is now convenient, but what is generally right. If the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0548300101:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people of Campbelltown be diſtreſſed by the reſtoration of the reſpondent, they are diſtreſſed only by their own fault; by turbulent paſſions and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſires; by tyranny, which law has defeated, and by malice which virtue has ſurmounted."</q>

               <p>Of our friend Goldſmith he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is ſo much afraid of being unnoticed, that he often talks merely leſt you ſhould forget that he is in the company."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, he ſtands forward."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; but if a man is to ſtand forward, he ſhould wiſh to do it not in an aukward poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not in rags, not ſo as that he ſhall only be expoſed to ridicule."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"For my part, I like very well to hear honeſt Goldſmith talk away careleſsly."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but he ſhould not like to hear himſelf."</q>

               <p>On Tueſday, April 14, the decree of the Court of Seſſion in the ſchool-maſter's cauſe was reverſed in the Houſe of Lords, after a very eloquent ſpeech by Lord Mansfield, who ſhewed himſelf an adept in ſchool diſcipline, but I thought was too rigorous towards my client. On the evening of the next day I ſupped with Dr. Johnſon, at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, in company with Mr. Langton and his brother-in-law, Lord Binning. I repeated a ſentence of Lord Mansfield's ſpeech, of which, by the aid of Mr. Longlands, the ſolicitor on the other ſide, who obligingly allowed me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his note with my own, I have a full copy: <q rend="inline">"My Lords, ſeverity is not the way to govern either boys or men."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Nay, (ſaid Johnſon,) it is the way to <hi>govern</hi> them. I know not whether it be the way to <hi>mend</hi> them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked of the recent expulſion of ſix ſtudents from the Univerſity of Oxford, who were methodiſts; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ould not deſiſt from publickly praying and exhorting. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that expulſion was extremely juſt and proper. What have they to do at an Univerſity who are not willing to be taught, but will preſume to teach? Where is religion to be learnt but at an Univerſity? Sir, they were examined, and found to be mighty ignorant fellows."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, was it not hard, Sir, to expel them, for I am told they were good beings?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I believe they might be good beings; but they were not fit to be in the Univerſity of Oxford. A cow is a very good animal in the field; but we turn her out of a garden."</q> Lord Elibank uſed to repeat this as an illuſtration uncommonly happy.</p>
               <p>Deſirous of calling Johnſon forth to talk, and exerciſe his wit, though I ſhould myſelf be the object of it, I reſolutely ventured to undertake the defence of convivial indulgence in wine, though he was not to-night in the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0548300101:409" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt genial humour. After urging the common plauſible topicks, I at laſt had recourſe to the maxim, <hi>in vino veritas;</hi> a man who is well warmed with wine will ſpeak truth. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that may be an argument for drinking, if you ſuppoſe men in general to be liars. But, Sir, I would not keep company with a fellow who lyes as long as he is ſober, and whom you muſt make drunk before you can get a word of truth out of him <note n="5" place="bottom">Mrs. Piozzi, in her <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes,"</q> p. 261, has given an erroneous account of this incident, as of many others. She pretends to relate it from recollection, as if ſhe herſelf had been preſent; when the fact is, that it was communicated to her by me. She has repreſented it as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, and the true point has eſcaped her.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Langton told us he was about to eſtabliſh a ſchool upon his eſtate, but it had been ſuggeſted to him, that it might have a tendency to make the people leſs induſtrious. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. While learning to read and write is a diſtinction, the few who have that diſtinction may be the leſs inclined to work: but when every body learns to read and write, it is no longer a diſtinction. A man who has a laced waiſtcoat is too fine a man to work; but if every body had laced waiſtcoats, we ſhould have people working in laced waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats. There are no people whatever more induſtrious, none who work more, than our manufacturers; yet they have all learnt to read and write. Sir, you muſt not neglect doing a thing immediately good, from fear of remote evil;—from fear of its being abuſed. A man who has candles may ſit up too late, which he would not do if he had not candles; but nobody will deny that the art of making candles, by which light is continued to us beyond the time that the ſun gives us light, is a valuable art, and ought to be preſerved."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, would it not be better to follow Nature; and go to bed and riſe juſt as Nature gives us light or with-holds it?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; for then we ſhould have no kind of equality in the partition of our time between ſleeping and waking. It would be very different in different ſeaſons and in different places. In ſome of the northern parts of Scotland how little light is there in the depth of winter!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of Tacitus, and I hazarded an opinion, that with all his merit for penetration, ſhrewdneſs of judgement, and terſeneſs of expreſſion, he was too compact, too much broken into hints, as it were, and therefore too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be underſtood. To my great ſatisfaction Dr. Johnſon ſanctioned this opinion. <q rend="inline">"Tacitus, Sir, ſeems to me rather to have made notes for an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical work, than to have written a hiſtory <note n="6" place="bottom">It is remarkable, that Lord Monboddo, whom on account of his reſembling Dr. Johnſon in ſome particulars, Foote called an Elzevir edition of him, has, by coincidence, made the very ſame remark. <hi>Origin and Progreſs of Language,</hi> vol. iii. 2d edit. p. 219.</note>."</q>

At this time it appears from his <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> that he had been more than commonly diligent in religious duties, particularly in reading the holy ſcriptures. It was Paſſion Week, that ſolemn ſeaſon which the Chriſtian world has appropriated to the commemoration of the myſteries of our redemption, and during which, whatever embers of religion are in our breaſts, will be kindled into pious warmth.</p>
               <p>I paid him ſhort viſits both on Friday and Saturday, and ſeeing his large folio Greek Teſtament before him, beheld him with a reverential awe, and would not intrude upon his time. While he was thus employed to ſuch good purpoſe, and while his friends in their intercourſe with him conſtantly found a vigorous intellect and a lively imagination, it is melancholy to read in his private regiſter, <q rend="inline">"My mind is unſettled and my memory confuſed. I have of late turned my thoughts with a very uſeleſs earneſtneſs upon paſt incidents. I have yet got no command over my thoughts; an unpleaſing incident is almoſt certain to hinder my reſt <note n="7" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 111.</note>."</q> What philoſophick heroiſm was it in him to appear with ſuch manly fortitude to the world, while he was inwardly ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed! We may ſurely believe that the myſterious principle of being <q rend="inline">"made perfect through ſuffering,"</q> was to be ſtrongly exemplified in him.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 19, being Eaſter-day, General Paoli and I paid him a viſit before dinner. We talked of the notion that blind perſons can diſtinguiſh colours by the touch. Johnſon ſaid, that Profeſſor Sanderſon mentions his having attempted to do it, but that he found he was aiming at an impoſſibility; that to be ſure a difference in the ſurface makes the difference of colours; but that difference is ſo fine, that it is not ſenſible to the touch. The General mentioned jugglers and fraudulent gameſters, who could know cards by the touch. Dr. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"the cards uſed by ſuch perſons muſt be leſs poliſhed than ours commonly are."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of ſounds. The General ſaid, there was no beauty in a ſimple ſound but only in an harmonious compoſition of ſounds. I preſumed to differ from this opinion, and mentioned the ſoft and ſweet ſound of a fine woman's voice. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, if a ſerpent or a toad uttered it, you would think it ugly."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So you would think, Sir, were a beautiful tune to be uttered by one of thoſe animals."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, it would be admired. We have ſeen fine fidlers whom we liked as little as toads,"</q> (laughing).</p>
               <p>Talking on the ſubject of taſte in the arts, he ſaid, that difference of taſte was, in truth, difference of ſkill. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, is there not a quality
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0548300101:411" rendition="simple:additions"/> called taſte, which conſiſts merely in perception or in liking? For inſtance, we find people differ much as to what is the beſt ſtyle of Engliſh compoſition. Some think Swift's the beſt; others prefer a fuller and grander way of writing."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you muſt firſt define what you mean by ſtyle, before you can judge who has a good taſte in ſtyle, and who has a bad. The two claſſes of perſons whom you have mentioned don't differ as to good and bad. They both agree that Swift has a good neat ſtyle; but one loves a neat ſtyle, another loves a ſtyle of more ſplendour. In like manner, one loves a plain coat, another loves a laced coat; but neither will deny that each is good in its kind."</q>

               <p>While I remained in London this ſpring, I was with him at ſeveral other times, both by himſelf and in company. I dined with him one day at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, with Lord Elibank, Mr. Langton, and Dr. Vanſittart of Oxford. Without ſpecifying each particular day, I have preſerved the following memorable things.</p>
               <p>I regretted the reflection in his Preface to Shakſpeare againſt Garrick, to whom we cannot but apply the following paſſage: <q rend="inline">"I collated ſuch copies as I could procure, and wiſhed for more, but have not found the collectors of theſe rarities very communicative."</q> I told him, that Garrick had complained to me of it, and had vindicated himſelf by aſſuring me, that Johnſon was made welcome to the full uſe of his collection, and that he left the key of it with a ſervant, with orders to have a fire and every convenience for him. I found Johnſon's notion was, that Garrick wanted to be courted for them, and that, on the contrary, Garrick ſhould have courted him, and ſent him the plays of his own accord. But, indeed, conſidering the flovenly and careleſs manner in which books were treated by Johnſon, it could not be expected that ſcarce and valuable editions ſhould have been lent to him.</p>
               <p>A gentleman having to ſome of the uſual arguments for drinking added this: <q rend="inline">"You know, Sir, drinking drives away care, and makes us forget what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is diſagreeable. Would not you allow a man to drink for that reaſon?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, if he ſat next <hi>you."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I expreſſed a liking for Mr. Francis Oſborn's works, and aſked him what he thought of that writer. He anſwered, <q rend="inline">"A conceited fellow. Were a man to write ſo now, the boys would throw ſtones at him."</q> He however did not alter my opinion of a favourite authour, to whom I was firſt directed by his being quoted in <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> and in whom I have found much ſhrewd and lively ſenſe, expreſſed indeed in a ſtyle ſomewhat quaint, which, however, I do not diſlike. His book has an air of originality. We figure to ourſelves an ancient gentleman talking to us.</p>

When one of his friends endeavoured to maintain that a country gentleman might contrive to paſs his life very agreeably, <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) you cannot give me an inſtance of any man who is permitted to lay out his own time, contriving not to have tedious hours."</q> This obſervation, however, is equally applicable to gentlemen who live in cities, and are of no profeſſion.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"there is no permanent national character; it varies according to circumſtances. Alexander the Great ſwept India: now the Turks ſweep Greece."</q>

               <p>A learned gentleman who in the courſe of converſation wiſhed to inform us of this ſimple fact, that the Counſel upon the circuit at Shrewſbury were much bitten by fleas, took, I ſuppoſe, ſeven or eight minutes in relating it circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially. He in a plenitude of phraſe told us, that large bales of woollen cloth were lodged in the town-hall;—that by reaſon of this, fleas neſtled there in prodigious numbers;—that the lodgings of the Counſel were near to the town-hall;—and that thoſe little animals moved from place to place with wonderful agility. Johnſon ſat in great impatience till the gentleman had finiſhed his tedious narrative, and then burſt out, <q rend="inline">"It is a pity, Sir, that you have not ſeen a lion; for a flea has taken you ſuch a time, that a lion muſt have ſerved you a twelvemonth <note n="8" place="bottom">Mrs. Piozzi, to whom I told this anecdote, has related it, as if the gentleman had given <q rend="inline">"the <hi>natural hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>mouſe."</hi>

               <p>Talking of a modern hiſtorian and a modern moraliſt, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"There is more thought in the moraliſt than in the hiſtorian.

               </p>
               <p>Before leaving London this year, I conſulted him upon a queſtion purely of Scotch law. It was held of old, and continued for a long period, to be an eſtabliſhed principle in that law, that whoever intermeddled with the effects of a perſon deceaſed, without the interpoſition of legal authority to guard againſt embezzlement, ſhould be ſubjected to pay all the debts of the deceaſed, as having been guilty of what was technically called <hi>vitious intromiſſion.</hi> The Court of Seſſion had gradually relaxed the ſtrictneſs of this principle, where the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference proved had been inconſiderable. In a caſe<note n="9" place="bottom">Wilſon againſt Smith and Armour.</note> which came before that Court the preceding winter, I had laboured to perſuade the Judges to return to the ancient law. It was my own ſincere opinion, that they ought to adhere to it; but I had exhauſted all my powers of reaſoning in vain. Johnſon thought as I did; and in order to aſſiſt me in my application to the Court for a reviſion and alteration of the judgement, he dictated to me the following argument:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>This, we are told, is a law which has its force only from the long prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Court; and may, therefore, be ſuſpended or modified as the Court ſhall think proper.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the power of the Court to make or to ſuſpend a law, we have no intention to inquire. It is ſufficient for our purpoſe that every juſt law is
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0548300101:414"/>
dictated by reaſon; and that the practice of every legal Court is regulated by equity. It is the quality of reaſon to be invariable and conſtant; and of equity, to give to one man what, in the ſame caſe, is given to another. The advantage which humanity derives from law is this: that the law gives every man a rule of action, and preſcribes a mode of conduct which ſhall entitle him to the ſupport and protection of ſociety. That the law may be a rule of action, it is neceſſary that it be known;—it is neceſſary that it be permanent and ſtable. The law is the meaſure of civil right; but if the meaſure be changeable, the extent of the thing meaſured never can be ſettled.</p>
                  <p>To permit a law to be modified at diſcretion, is to leave the community without law. It is to withdraw the direction of that publick wiſdom, by which the deficiencies of private underſtanding are to be ſupplied. It is to ſuffer the raſh and ignorant to act at diſcretion, and then to depend for the legality of that action on the ſentence of the Judge. He that is thus governed, lives not by law, but by opinion: not by a certain rule to which he can apply his intention before he acts, but by an uncertain and variable opinion, which he can never know but after he has committed the act on which that opinion ſhall be paſſed. He lives by a law (if a law it be,) which he can never know before he has offended it. To this caſe may be juſtly applied that important principle, <hi>miſera eſt ſervitus ubi jus eſt aut incognitum aut vagum.</hi> If Intromiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be not criminal till it exceeds a certain point, and that point be unſettled, and conſequently different in different minds, the right of Intromiſſion, and the right of the Creditor ariſing from it, are all <hi>jura vaga,</hi> and, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, are <hi>jura incognita;</hi> and the reſult can be no other than a <hi>miſera ſervitus,</hi> an uncertainty concerning the event of action, a ſervile dependance on private opinion.</p>
                  <p>It may be urged, and with great plauſibility, that there may be Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion without fraud; which, however true, will by no means juſtify an occaſional and arbitrary relaxation of the law. The end of law is protection as well as vengeance. Indeed, vengeance is never uſed but to ſtrengthen protection. That ſociety only is well governed, where life is freed from danger and from ſuſpicion; where poſſeſſion is ſo ſheltered by ſalutary prohibitions, that violation is prevented more frequently than puniſhed. Such a prohibition was this, while it operated with its original force. The creditor of the deceaſed was not only without loſs, but without fear. He was not to ſeek a remedy for an injury ſuffered; for injury was warded off.</p>
                  <p>As the law has been ſometimes adminiſtered, it lays us open to wounds, becauſe it is imagined to have the power of healing. To puniſh fraud when
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0548300101:415"/> it is detected, is the proper act of vindictive juſtice; but to prevent frauds, and make puniſhment unneceſſary, is the great employment of legiſlative wiſdom. To permit Intromiſſion, and to puniſh fraud, is to make law no better than a pitfall. To tread upon the brink is ſafe; but to come a ſtep further is deſtruction. But, ſurely, it is better to encloſe the gulf, and hinder all acceſs, than by encouraging us to advance a little, to entice us afterwards a little further, and let us perceive our folly only by our deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>As law ſupplies the weak with adventitious ſtrength, it likewiſe enlightens the ignorant with extrinſick underſtanding. Law teaches us to know when we commit injury, and when we ſuffer it. It fixes certain marks upon actions, by which we are admoniſhed to do or to forbear them. <hi>Qui ſibi bene temperat in licitis,</hi> ſays one of the fathers, <hi>nunquam cadet in illicita.</hi> He who never intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits at all, will never intromit with fraudulent intentions.</p>
                  <p>The relaxation of the law againſt vicious intromiſſion has been very favourably repreſented by a great maſter of juriſprudence <note n="1" place="bottom">Lord Kames, in his <q rend="inline">"Hiſtorical Law Tracts."</q>
                     </note>, whoſe words have been exhibited with unneceſſary pomp, and ſeem to be conſidered as irreſiſtibly deciſive. The great moment of his authority makes it neceſſary to examine his poſition. <q rend="inline">'Some ages ago, (ſays he,) before the ferocity of the inhabitants of this part of the iſland was ſubdued, the utmoſt ſeverity of the civil law was neceſſary, to reſtrain individuals from plundering each other. Thus, the man who intermeddled irregularly with the moveables of a perſon deceaſed, was ſubjected to all the debts of the deceaſed without limitation. This makes a branch of the law of Scotland, known by the name of <hi>vicious intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;</hi> and ſo rigidly was this regulation applied in our Courts of Law, that the moſt trifling moveable abſtracted <hi>malâ fide,</hi> ſubjected the intermeddler to the foregoing conſequences, which proved in many inſtances a moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous puniſhment. But this ſeverity was neceſſary, in order to ſubdue the undiſciplined nature of our people. It is extremely remarkable, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our improvement in manners, this regulation has been gradually ſoftened, and applied by our ſovereign Court with a ſparing hand.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find myſelf under a neceſſity of obſerving, that this learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious writer has not accurately diſtinguiſhed the deficiencies and demands of the different conditions of human life, which, from a degree of ſavageneſs and independence, in which all laws are vain, paſſes or may paſs, by innumerable gradations, to a ſtate of reciprocal benignity, in which laws ſhall be no longer neceſſary. Men are firſt wild and unſocial, living each man to himſelf, taking
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0548300101:416"/>
from the weak, and loſing to the ſtrong. In their firſt coalitions of ſociety, much of this original ſavageneſs is retained. Of general happineſs, the product of general confidence, there is yet no thought. Men continue to proſecute their own advantages by the neareſt way; and the utmoſt ſeverity of the civil law is neceſſary to reſtrain individuals from plundering each other. The reſtraints then neceſſary, are reſtraints from plunder, from acts of publick violence, and undiſguiſed oppreſſion. The ferocity of our anceſtors, as of all other nations, produced not fraud but rapine. They had not yet learned to cheat, and attempted only to rob. As manners grow more poliſhed, with the knowledge of good, men attain likewiſe dexterity in evil. Open rapine becomes leſs frequent, and violence gives way to cunning. Thoſe who before invaded paſtures and ſtormed houſes, now begin to enrich themſelves by unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and fraudulent intromiſſions. It is not againſt the violence of ferocity, but the circumventions of deceit, that this law was framed; and I am afraid the increaſe of commerce, and the inceſſant ſtruggle for riches which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce excites, give us no proſpect of an end ſpeedily to be expected of artifice and fraud. It therefore ſeems to be no very concluſive reaſoning, which connects thoſe two propoſitions;—'the nation is become leſs ferocious, and therefore the laws againſt fraud and <hi>coven</hi> ſhall be relaxed.'</p>
                  <p>Whatever reaſon may have influenced the Judges to a relaxation of the law, it was not that the nation was grown leſs fierce; and, I am afraid, it cannot be affirmed that it is grown leſs fraudulent.</p>
                  <p>Since this law has been repreſented as rigorouſly and unreaſonably penal, it ſeems not improper to conſider what are the conditions and qualities that make the juſtice or propriety of a penal law.</p>
                  <p>To make a penal law reaſonable and juſt, two conditions are neceſſary, and two proper. It is neceſſary that the law ſhould be adequate to its end; that, if it be obſerved, it ſhall prevent the evil againſt which it is directed. It is, ſecondly, neceſſary that the end of the law be of ſuch importance, as to deſerve the ſecurity of a penal ſanction. The other conditions of a penal law, which though not abſolutely neceſſary, are to a very high degree fit, are, that to the moral violation of the law there are many temptations, and that of the phyſical obſervance there is great facility.</p>
                  <p>All theſe conditions apparently concur to juſtify the law which we are now conſidering. Its end is the ſecurity of property; and property very often of great value. The method by which it effects the ſecurity is effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, becauſe it admits, in its original rigour, no gradations of injury; but keeps guilt and innocence apart, by a diſtinct and definite limitation. He
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0548300101:417"/> that intromits, is criminal; he that intromits not, is innocent. Of the two ſecondary conſiderations it cannot be denied that both are in our favour. The temptation to intromit is frequent and ſtrong; ſo ſtrong and ſo frequent, as to require the utmoſt activity of juſtice, and vigilance of caution, to withſtand its prevalence; and the method by which a man may entitle himſelf to legal intromiſſion is ſo open and ſo facile, that no neglect it is a proof of fraudulent intention: for why ſhould a man omit to do (but for reaſons which he will not confeſs,) that which he can do ſo eaſily, and that which he knows to be required by the law? If temptation were rare, a penal law might be deemed unneceſſary. If the duty enjoined by the law were of difficult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, omiſſion, though it could not be juſtified, might be pitied. But in the preſent caſe, neither equity nor compaſſion operate againſt it. A uſeful, a neceſſary law is broken, not only without a reaſonable motive, but with all the inducements to obedience that can be derived from ſafety and facility.</p>
                  <p>I therefore return to my original poſition, that a law, to have its effect, muſt be permanent and ſtable. It may be ſaid, in the language of the ſchools, <hi>Lex non recepit majus et minus,</hi>—we may have a law, or we may have no law, but we cannot have half a law. We muſt either have a rule of action, or be permitted to act by diſcretion and by chance. Deviations from the law muſt be uniformly puniſhed, or no man can be certain when he ſhall be ſafe.</p>
                  <p>That from the rigour of the original inſtitution this Court has ſometimes departed, cannot be denied. But, as it is evident that ſuch deviations, as they make law uncertain, make life unſafe, I hope, that of departing from it there will now be an end; that the wiſdom of our anceſtors will be treated with due reverence; and that conſiſtent and ſteady deciſions will furniſh the people with a rule of action, and leave fraud and fraudulent intromiſſion no future hope of impunity or eſcape.</p>
               </q>
               <p>With ſuch comprehenſion of mind, and ſuch clearneſs of penetration, did he thus treat a ſubject altogether new to him, without any other preparation than my having ſtated to him the arguments which had been uſed on each ſide of the queſtion. His intellectual powers appeared with peculiar luſtre, when tried againſt thoſe of a writer of ſo much fame as Lord Kames, and that too in his Lordſhip's own department.</p>
               <p>This maſterly argument, after being prefaced and concluded with ſome ſentences of my own, and garniſhed with the uſual formularies, was actually printed and laid before the Lords of Seſſion, but without ſucceſs. My reſpected friend Lord Hailes, however, one of that honourable body, had
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0548300101:418" rendition="simple:additions"/>
critical ſagacity enough to diſcover a more than ordinary hand in the <hi>Petition.</hi> I told him that Dr. Johnſon had favoured me with his pen. His Lordſhip, with wonderful <hi>acumen,</hi> pointed out exactly where his compoſition began, and where it ended. But that I may do impartial juſtice, and conform to the great rule of Courts, <hi>Suum cuique tribuito,</hi> I muſt add, that their Lordſhips in general, though they were pleaſed to call this <q rend="inline">"a well-drawn paper,"</q> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the former very inferiour petition which I had written; thus confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of an obſervation made to me by one of their number, in a merry mood: <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, give yourſelf no trouble in the compoſition of the papers you preſent to us; for, indeed, it is caſting pearls before ſwine."</q>

I am always glad to find myſelf not forgotten, and to be forgotten by you would give me great uneaſineſs. My northern friends have never been unkind to me: I have from you, dear Sir, teſtimonies of affection, which I have not often been able to excite; and Dr. Beattie rates the teſtimony which I was deſirous of paying to his merit, much higher than I ſhould have thought it reaſonable to expect.</p>
                     <p>I have heard of your maſquerade. What ſays your Synod to ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations? I am not ſtudiouſly ſcrupulous, nor do I think a maſquerade either evil in itſelf, or very likely to be the occaſion of evil; yet as the world thinks it a very licentious relaxation of manners, I would not have been one of the <hi>firſt</hi> maſquers in a country where no maſquerade had ever been before <note n="2" place="bottom">There had been maſquerades in Scotland before; but not for a very long time.</note>.</p>
                     <p>A new edition of my great Dictionary is printed, from a copy which I was perſuaded to reviſe; but having made no preparation, I was able to do very little. Some ſuperfluities I have expunged, and ſome faults I have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and here and there have ſcattered a remark; but the main fabrick of the work remains as it was. I had looked very little into it ſince I wrote it, and, I think, I found it full as often better, as worſe, than I expected.</p>
                     <p>Baretti and Davies have had a furious quarrel; a quarrel, I think, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable. Dr. Goldſmith has a new comedy, which is expected in the

The dialogue is quick and gay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the incidents are ſo prepared as not to ſeem improbable.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry that you loſt your cauſe of Intromiſſion, becauſe I yet think the arguments on your ſide unanſwerable. But you ſeem, I think, to ſay that you gained reputation even by your defeat; and reputation you will daily gain, if you keep Lord Auchinleck's precept in your mind, and endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate in your mind a firm and regular ſyſtem of law, inſtead of picking up occaſional fragments.</p>
                     <p>My health ſeems in general to improve; but I have been troubled for many weeks with a vexatious catarrh, which is ſometimes ſufficiently diſtreſsful. I have not found any great effects from bleeding and phyſick; and am afraid, that I muſt expect help from brighter days and ſofter air.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, April 3, the day after my arrival in London this year, I went to his houſe late in the evening, and ſat with Mrs. Williams till he came home. I found in the London Chronicle, Dr. Goldſmith's apology to the publick for beating Evans, a bookſeller, on account of a paragraph in a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper publiſhed by him, which Goldſmith thought impertinent to him and to a lady of his acquaintance. The apology was written ſo much in Dr. Johnſon's manner, that both Mrs. Williams and I ſuppoſed it to be his; but when he came home he ſoon undeceived us. When he ſaid to Mrs. Williams, <q rend="inline">"Well, Dr. Goldſmith's <hi>manifeſto</hi> has got into your paper;"</q> I aſked him if Dr. Goldſmith had written it, with an air that made him ſee I ſuſpected it was his, though ſubſcribed by Goldſmith. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, Dr. Goldſmith would no more have aſked me to write ſuch a thing as that for him, than he would have aſked me to feed him with a ſpoon, or to do any thing elſe that denoted his imbecillity. I as much believe that he wrote it, as if I had ſeen him do it. Sir, had he ſhewn it to any one friend, he would not have been allowed to publiſh it. He has, indeed, done it very well; but it is a fooliſh thing well done. I ſuppoſe he has been ſo much elated with the ſucceſs of his new
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0548300101:422" rendition="simple:additions"/>
comedy, that he has thought every thing that concerned him muſt be of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the publick."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I fancy, Sir, this is the firſt time that he has been engaged in ſuch an adventure."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I believe it is the firſt time he has <hi>beat;</hi> he may have <hi>been beaten</hi> before. This, Sir, is a new plume to him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Sir John Dalrymple's <q rend="inline">"Memoirs of Great-Britain and Ireland,"</q> and his diſcoveries to the prejudice of Lord Ruſſel and Algernon Sydney. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, every body who had juſt notions of government thought them raſcals before. It is well that all mankind now ſee them to be raſcals."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, may not thoſe diſcoveries be true without their being raſcals."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Conſider, Sir; would any of them have been willing to have had it known that they intrigued with France? Depend upon it, Sir, he who does what he is afraid ſhould be known, has ſomething rotten about him. This Dalrymple ſeems to be an honeſt fellow; for he tells equally what makes againſt both ſides. But nothing can be poorer than his mode of writing: it is the mere bouncing of a ſchool-boy. Great He! but greater She! and ſuch ſtuff."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I could not agree with him in this criticiſm; for though Sir John Dalrymple's ſtyle is not regularly formed in any reſpect, and one cannot help ſmiling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at his affected <hi>grandiloquence,</hi> there is in his writing a pointed vivacity, and much of a gentlemanly ſpirit.</p>
               <p>At Mr. Thrale's, in the evening, he repeated his uſual paradoxical decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt action in publick ſpeaking. <q rend="inline">"Action can have no effect upon reaſonable minds. It may augment noiſe, but it never can enforce argument. If you ſpeak to a dog, you uſe action; you hold up your hand thus, becauſe he is a brute; and in proportion as men are removed from brutes, action will have the leſs influence upon them."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"What then, Sir, becomes of Demoſthenes's ſaying? 'Action, action, action!"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Demoſthenes, Madam, ſpoke to an aſſembly of brutes; to a barbarous people."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it extraordinary, that he ſhould deny the power of rhetorical action upon human nature, when it is proved by innumerable facts in all ſtages of ſociety. Reaſonable beings are not ſolely reaſonable. They have fancies which may be pleaſed, paſſions which may be rouſed.</p>
               <p>Lord Cheſterfield being mentioned, Johnſon remarked, that almoſt all of that celebrated nobleman's witty ſayings were puns. He, however, allowed the merit of good wit to his Lordſhip's ſaying of Lord Tyrawley and himſelf, when both very old and infirm: <q rend="inline">"Tyrawley and I have been dead theſe two years; but we don't chooſe to have it known."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0548300101:423" rendition="simple:additions"/> He talked with approbation of an intended edition of <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> with notes; two volumes of which had been prepared by a gentleman eminent in the literary world, and the materials which he had collected for the remainder had been transferred to another hand. He obſerved, that all works which deſcribe manners, require notes in ſixty or ſeventy years, or leſs; and told us, he had communicated all he knew that could throw light upon <q rend="inline">"The Spectator."</q> He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Addiſon had made his Sir Andrew Freeport a true Whig, arguing againſt giving charity to beggars, and throwing out other ſuch ungracious ſentiments; but that he had thought better, and made amends by making him found an hoſpital for decayed farmers."</q> He called for the volume of <q rend="inline">"The Spectator"</q> in which that account is contained, and read it aloud to us. He read ſo well, that every thing acquired additional weight and grace from his utterance.</p>
               <p>The converſation having turned on modern imitations of ancient ballads, and ſome one having praiſed their ſimplicity, he treated them with that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule which he always diſplayed when this ſubject was mentioned.</p>
               <p>He diſapproved of introducing ſcripture phraſes into ſecular diſcourſe. This ſeemed to me a queſtion of ſome difficulty. A ſcripture expreſſion may be uſed, like a highly claſſical phraſe, to produce an inſtantaneous ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and it may be done without being at all improper. Yet I own there is danger, that applying the language of our ſacred book to ordinary ſubjects may tend to leſſen our reverence for it. If therefore it be introduced at all, it ſhould be with very great caution.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 8, I ſat a good part of the evening with him, but he was very ſilent. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Burnet's Hiſtory of his own Times,' is very entertaining. The ſtyle, indeed, is mere chit-chat. I do not believe that Burnet intentionally lyed; but he was ſo much prejudiced, that he took no pains to find out the truth. He was like a man who reſolves to regulate his time by a certain watch; but will not inquire whether the watch is right or not."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though he was not diſpoſed to talk, he was unwilling that I ſhould leave him; and when I looked at my watch, and told him it was twelve o'clock, he cried, <q rend="inline">"What's that to you and me?"</q> and ordered Frank to tell Mrs. Williams that we were coming to drink tea with her, which we did. It was ſettled that we ſhould go to church together next day.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of April, being Good Friday, I breakfaſted with him on tea and croſs-buns; <hi>Doctor</hi> Levet, as Frank called him, making the tea. He carried me with him to the church of St. Clement Danes, where he had his ſeat; and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0548300101:424"/>
his behaviour was, as I had imaged to myſelf, ſolemnly devout. I never ſhall forget the tremulous earneſtneſs with which he pronounced the aweful petition in the Litany: <q rend="inline">"In the hour of death, and at the day of judgement, good LORD deliver us."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We went to church both in the morning and evening. In the interval between the two ſervices we did not dine, but he read in the Greek New Teſtament, and I turned over ſeveral of his books.</p>
               <p>In Archbiſhop Laud's Diary, I found the following paſſage, which I read to Dr. Johnſon:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"1623. February 1, Sunday. I ſtood by the moſt illuſtrious Prince Charles<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                     <note place="bottom">
                        <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Afterwards Charles I.</note>, at dinner. He was then very merry, and talked occaſionally of many things with his attendants. Among other things, he ſaid, that if he were neceſſitated to take any particular profeſſion of life, he could not be a lawyer, adding his reaſons: 'I cannot (ſaith he,) defend a bad, nor yield in a good cauſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, this is falſe reaſoning; becauſe every cauſe has a bad ſide: and a lawyer is not overcome, though the cauſe which he has endeavoured to ſupport be determined againſt him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I told him that Goldſmith had ſaid to me a few days before, <q rend="inline">"As I take my ſhoes from the ſhoemaker, and my coat from the taylor, ſo I take my religion from the prieſt."</q> I regretted this looſe way of talking. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he knows nothing; he has made up his mind about nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>To my great ſurprize, he aſked me to dine with him on Eaſter-day. I never ſuppoſed that he had a dinner at his houſe; for I had not then heard of any one of his friends having been entertained at his table. He told me, <q rend="inline">"I generally have a meat pye on Sunday: it is baked at a publick oven, which is very properly allowed, becauſe one man can attend it; and thus the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is obtained of not keeping ſervants from church to dreſs dinners."</q>
               </p>
               <p>April 11, being Eaſter-Sunday, after having attended divine ſervice at St. Paul's, I repaired to Dr. Johnſon's. I had gratified my curioſity much in dining with JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU, while he lived in the wilds of Neuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatel: I had as great a curioſity to dine with DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, in the duſky receſs of a court in Fleet-ſtreet. I ſuppoſed we ſhould ſcarcely have knives and forks, and only ſome ſtrange uncouth ill-dreſt diſh: but I found every thing in very good order. We had no other company but Mrs. Williams and a young woman whom I did not know. As a dinner here was conſidered as a ſingular phaenomenon, and as I was frequently interrogated on the ſubject, my
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0548300101:425" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 readers may perhaps be deſirous to know our bill of fare. Foote, I remember, in alluſion to Francis, the <hi>negro,</hi> was willing to ſuppoſe that our repaſt was <hi>black broth.</hi> But the fact was, that we had a very good ſoup, a boiled leg of lamb and ſpinach, a veal pye, and a rice pudding.</p>
               <p>Of Dr. John Campbell, the authour, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He is a very inquiſitive and a very able man, and a man of good religious principles, though I am afraid he has been deficient in practice. Campbell is radically right; and we may hope, that in time there will be good practice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He owned that he thought Hawkeſworth was one of his imitators, but he did not think Goldſmith was. Goldſmith, he ſaid, had great merit. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, he is much indebted to you for his getting ſo high in the publick eſtimation."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he has, perhaps, got <hi>ſooner</hi> to it by his intimacy with me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Goldſmith, though his vanity often excited him to occaſional competition, had a very high regard for Johnſon, which he at this time expreſſed in the ſtrongeſt manner in the Dedication of his comedy, entitled, <q rend="inline">"She ſtoops to conquer <note n="4" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"By inſcribing this ſlight performance to you, I do not mean ſo much to compliment you, as myſelf. It may do me ſome honour to inform the publick, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may ſerve the intereſts of mankind alſo to inform them, that the greateſt wit may be found in a character, without impairing the moſt unaffected piety."</q>
                     </note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon obſerved, that there were very few books printed in Scotland before the Union. He had ſeen a complete collection of them in the poſſeſſion of the Honourable Archibald Campbell, a nonjuring Biſhop <note n="4" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">"By inſcribing this ſlight performance to you, I do not mean ſo much to compliment you, as myſelf. It may do me ſome honour to inform the publick, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may ſerve the intereſts of mankind alſo to inform them, that the greateſt wit may be found in a character, without impairing the moſt unaffected piety."</q>
                  </note>. I wiſh this collection had been kept entire. Many of them are in the library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh. I told Dr. Johnſon that I had ſome intention to write the life of the learned and worthy Thomas Ruddiman. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould take pleaſure in helping you to do honour to him. But his farewell letter to the Faculty of Advocates, when he reſigned the office of their Librarian, ſhould have been in Latin."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I put a queſtion to him upon a fact in common life, which he could not anſwer, nor have I found any one elſe who could. What is the reaſon that women ſervants, though obliged to be at the expence of purchaſing their own clothes, have much lower wages than men ſervants, to whom a great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that article is furniſhed, and when in fact our female houſe ſervants work much harder than the male? <note place="bottom">5 See an account of this learned and reſpectable gentleman, and of his curious work on the <hi>Middle State,</hi>

                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:0548300101:426" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He told me, that he had twelve or fourteen times attempted to keep a journal of his life, but never could perſevere. He adviſed me to do it. <q rend="inline">"The great thing to be recorded, (ſaid he,) is the ſtate of your own mind; and you ſhould write down every thing that you remember, for you cannot judge at firſt what is good or bad; and write immediately while the impreſſion is freſh, for it will not be the ſame a week afterwards."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I again ſolicited him to communicate to me the particulars of his early years. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You ſhall have them all for two-pence. I hope you ſhall know a great deal more of me before you write my Life."</q> He mentioned to me this day many circumſtances, which I wrote down when I went home, and have interwoven in the former part of this narrative.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, April 13, he and Dr. Goldſmith and I dined at General Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe's. Goldſmith expatiated on the common topick, that the race of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was degenerated, and that this was owing to luxury. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, in the firſt place, I doubt the fact. I believe there are as many tall men in England now, as ever there were. But, ſecondly, ſuppoſing the ſtature of our people to be diminiſhed, that is not owing to luxury; for, Sir, conſider to how very ſmall a proportion of our people luxury can reach. Our ſoldiery, ſurely, are not luxurious, who live on ſix-pence a day; and the ſame remark will apply to almoſt all the other claſſes. Luxury, ſo far as it reaches the poor, will do good to the race of people: it will ſtrengthen and multiply them. Sir, no nation was ever hurt by luxury; for, as I ſaid before, it can reach but to a very few. I admit that the great increaſe of commerce and manufactures hurts the military ſpirit of a people; becauſe it produces a competition for ſomething elſe than martial honours,—a competition for riches. It alſo hurts the bodies of the people; for you will obſerve, there is no man who works at any particular trade, but you may know him from his appearance to do ſo. One part or other of his body being more uſed than the reſt, he is in ſome degree deformed: but, Sir, that is not luxury. A tailor ſits croſs-legged; but that is not luxury."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Come, you're juſt going to the ſame place by another road."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I ſay that is not <hi>luxury.</hi> Let us take a walk from Charing-croſs to Whitechapel, through, I ſuppoſe, the greateſt ſeries of ſhops in the world, what is there is any of theſe ſhops, (if you except gin-ſhops,) that can do any human being any harm?"</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, I'll accept your challenge. The very next ſhop to Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-houſe is a pickle-ſhop."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir: do we not know that a maid can in one afternoon make pickles ſufficient to ſerve a whole family for a year? nay, that five pickle-ſhops can ſerve all the kingdom? Beſides,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0548300101:427" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sir, there is no harm done to any body by the making of pickles, or the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pickles."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We drank tea with the ladies; and Goldſmith ſung Tony Lumpkin's ſong in his comedy, <q rend="inline">"She ſtoops to conquer,"</q> and a very pretty one, to an Iriſh tune, which he had deſigned for Miſs Hardcaſtle; but as Mrs. Bulkeley, who played the part, could not ſing, it was left out. He afterwards wrote it down for me, by which means it was preſerved, and now appears amongſt his poems. Dr. Johnſon, in his way home, ſtopt at my lodgings in Piccadilly, and ſat with me, drinking tea a ſecond time, till a late hour.</p>
               <p>I told him that Mrs. Macaulay ſaid, ſhe wondered how he could reconcile his political principles with his moral; his notions of inequality and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with wiſhing well to the happineſs of all mankind, who might live ſo agreeably, had they all their portions of land, and none to domineer over another. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I reconcile my principles very well, becauſe mankind are happier in a ſtate of inequality and ſubordination. Were they to be in this pretty ſtate of equality, they would ſoon degenerate into brutes;—they would become Monboddo's nation;—their tails would grow. Sir, all would be loſers, were all to work to all:—they would have no intellectual improvement. All intellectual improvement ariſes from leiſure: all leiſure ariſes from one working for another."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of the family of Stuart, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It ſhould ſeem that the family at preſent on the throne has now eſtabliſhed as good a right as the former family, by the long conſent of the people; and that to diſturb this right might be conſidered as culpable. At the ſame time I own, that it is a very difficult queſtion, when conſidered with reſpect to the houſe of Stuart. To oblige people to take oaths as to the diſputed right, is wrong. I know not whether I could take them: but I do not blame thoſe who do."</q> So conſcientious and ſo delicate was he upon this ſubject, which has occaſioned ſo much clamour againſt him.</p>
               <p>Talking of law caſes, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The Engliſh reports, in general, are very poor: only the half of what has been ſaid is taken down; and of that half, much is miſtaken. Whereas, in Scotland, the arguments on each ſide are deliberately put in writing, to be conſidered by the Court. I think a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your caſes upon ſubjects of importance, with the opinions of the Judges upon them, would be valuable."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 15, I dined with him and Dr. Goldſmith at General Paoli's. We found here, Signor Martinelli, of Florence, authour of a Hiſtory of England in Italian, printed at London.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0548300101:428" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſpoke of Allan Ramſay's <q rend="inline">"Gentle Shepherd,"</q> in the Scottiſh dialect, as the beſt paſtoral that had ever been written; not only abounding with beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rural imagery, and juſt and pleaſing ſentiments, but being a real picture of manners; and I offered to teach Dr. Johnſon to underſtand it. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, (ſaid he,) I won't learn it. You ſhall retain your ſuperiority by my not knowing it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This brought on a queſtion whether one man is leſſened by another's acquiring an equal degree of knowledge with him. Johnſon aſſerted the affirmative. I maintained that the poſition might be true in thoſe kinds of knowledge which produce wiſdom, power, and force, ſo as to enable one man to have the government of others; but that a man is not in any degree leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened by others knowing as well as he what ends in mere pleaſure:—eating fine fruits, drinking delicious wines, reading exquiſite poetry.</p>
               <p>The General obſerved, that Martinelli was a Whig. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I am ſorry for it. It ſhews the ſpirit of the times: he is obliged to temporiſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I rather think, Sir, that Toryiſm prevails in this reign."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I know not why you ſhould think ſo, Sir. You ſee your friend Lord Lyttelton, a nobleman, is obliged in his Hiſtory to write the moſt vulgar Whiggiſm."</q>
               </p>
               <p>An animated debate took place whether Martinelli ſhould continue his Hiſtory of England to the preſent day. GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure he ſhould."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; he would give great offence. He would have to tell of almoſt all the living great what they do not wiſh told."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"It may, perhaps, be neceſſary for a native to be more cautious; but a foreigner who comes among us without prejudice, may be conſidered as holding the place of a Judge, and may ſpeak his mind freely."</q> JOHNSON<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, a foreigner, when he ſends a work from the preſs, ought to be on his guard againſt catching the errour and miſtaken enthuſiaſm of the people among whom he happens to be."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he wants only to ſell his hiſtory, and tell truth; one an honeſt, the other a laudable motive."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they are both laudable motives. It is laudable in a man to wiſh to live by his labours; but he ſhould write ſo as he may <hi>live</hi> by them, not ſo as he may be knocked on the head. I would adviſe him to be at Calais before he publiſhes his hiſtory of the preſent age. A foreigner who attaches himſelf to a political party in this country, is in the worſt ſtate that can be imagined: he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler. A native may do it from intereſt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Or principle."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"There are people who tell a hundred political lies every day, and are not hurt by it. Surely,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0548300101:429"/>
 then, one may tell truth with ſafety."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, in the firſt place, he who tells a hundred lies has diſarmed the force of his lies. But beſides; a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him, than one truth which he does not wiſh ſhould be told."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"For my part, I'd tell truth, and ſhame the devil."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but the devil will be angry. I wiſh to ſhame the devil as much as you do; but I ſhould chooſe to be out of the reach of his claws."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"His claws can do you no harm, when you have the ſhield of truth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It having been obſerved that there was little hoſpitality in London; JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, any man who has a name, or who has the power of pleaſing, will be very generally invited in London. The man, Sterne, I have been told, has had engagements for three months."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"And a very dull fellow."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir."</q>

               <p>Martinelli told us, that for ſeveral years he lived much with Charles Townſhend, and that he ventured to tell him he was a bad joker. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, thus much I can ſay upon the ſubject. One day he and a few more agreed to go and dine in the country, and each of them was to bring a a friend in his carriage with him. Charles Townſhend aſked Fitzherbert to go with him, but told him, 'You muſt find ſomebody to bring you back: I can only carry you there.' Fitzherbert did not much like this arrangement. He however conſented, obſerving ſarcaſtically, 'It will do very well; for then the ſame jokes will ſerve you in returning as in going."</q>
               </p>
               <p>An eminent publick character being mentioned;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I remember being preſent when he ſhewed himſelf to be ſo corrupted, or at leaſt ſomething ſo different from what I think right, as to maintain, that a member of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould go along with his party right or wrong. Now, Sir, this is ſo remote from native virtue, from ſcholaſtick virtue, that a good man muſt have undergone a great change before he can reconcile himſelf to ſuch a doctrine. It is maintaining, that you may lie to the publick; for you lie when you call that right which you think wrong, or the reverſe. A friend of ours, who is too much an echo of that gentleman, obſerved, that a man who does not ſtick uniformly to a party, is only waiting to be bought. Why then, ſaid I, he is only waiting to be what that gentleman is already."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the King's coming to ſee Goldſmith's new play.—<q rend="inline">"I wiſh he would,"</q> ſaid Goldſmith; adding, however, with an affected indifference, <q rend="inline">"Not that it would do me the leaſt good."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well then, Sir, let us ſay it would do <hi>him</hi> good, (laughing.) No, Sir, this affectation will not paſs;—it is mighty idle. In ſuch a ſtate as ours, who would not wiſh to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0548300101:430"/>
pleaſe the chief magiſtrate?"</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"I <hi>do</hi> wiſh to pleaſe him. I remember a line in Dryden,
<q>
                        <l>'And ev'ry poet is the Monarch's friend.'</l>
                     </q>
It ought to be reverſed."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, there are finer lines in Dryden on this ſubject:
<q>
                        <l>'For colleges on bounteous Kings depend,</l>
                        <l>'And never rebel was to arts a friend."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
General Paoli obſerved, that ſucceſsful rebels might. MARTINELLI. <q rend="inline">"Happy rebellions."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"We have no ſuch phraſe."</q> GENERAL PAOLI. <q rend="inline">"But have you not the <hi>thing?"</hi>
                  </q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Yes; all our <hi>happy</hi> revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. They have hurt our conſtitution, and will hurt it, till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION."</q>—I never before diſcovered that my friend Goldſmith had ſo much of the old prejudice in him.</p>
               <p>General Paoli, talking of Goldſmith's new play, ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Il a fait un com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment très gracieux à une certaine grande dame;"</hi>
                  </q> meaning a Ducheſs of the firſt rank.</p>
               <p>I expreſſed a doubt whether Goldſmith intended it, in order that I might hear the truth from himſelf. It, perhaps, was not quite fair to endeavour to bring him to a confeſſion, as he might not wiſh to avow poſitively his taking part againſt the Court. He ſmiled and heſitated. The General at once relieved him, by this beautiful image: <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Monſieur Goldſmith eſt comme la mer qui jette des perles et beaucoup d'autres belles choſes, ſans s'en appercevoir."</hi>
                  </q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Très bien dit, et très élégamment."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A perſon was mentioned, who it was ſaid could take down in ſhort hand the ſpeeches in parliament with perfect exactneſs. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I remember one Angel, who came to me to write for him a Preface or Dedication to a book upon ſhort hand, and he profeſſed to write as faſt as a man could ſpeak. In order to try him, I took down a book, and read while he wrote; and I favoured him, for I read more deliberately than uſual. I had proceeded but a very little way, when he begged I would deſiſt, for he could not follow me."</q> Hearing now for the firſt time of this Preface or Dedication, I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What an expence, Sir, do you put us to in buying books, to which you have written Prefaces or Dedications."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why I have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Royal Family all round; that is to ſay, to the laſt generation of the Royal Family."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"And perhaps, Sir, not one ſentence of wit
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0548300101:431"/> in a whole Dedication."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps not, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What then is the reaſon for applying to a particular perſon to do that which any one may do as well?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, one man has greater readineſs at doing it than another."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpoke of Mr. Harris, of Saliſbury, as being a very learned man, and in particular an eminent Grecian. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I am not ſure of that. His friends give him out as ſuch, but I know not who of his friends are able to judge of it."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"He is what is much better: he is a worthy humane man."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, that is not to the purpoſe of our argument: that will as much prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"The greateſt muſical performers have but ſmall emoluments. Giardini, I am told, does not get above ſeven hundred a year."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is, indeed, but little for a man to get, who does beſt that which ſo many endeavour to do. There is nothing, I think, in which the power of art is ſhewn ſo much as in playing on the fiddle. In all other things we can do ſomething at firſt. Any man will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not ſo well as a ſmith, but tolerably. A man will ſaw a piece of wood, and make a box, though a clumſy one; but give him a fiddle and a fiddle-ſtick, and he can do nothing."</q>

               <p>On Monday, April 19, he called on me with Mrs. Williams, in Mr. Strahan's coach, and carried me out to dine with Mr. Elphinſton, at his academy at Kenſington. A printer having acquired a fortune ſufficient to keep his coach, was a good topick for the credit of literature. Mrs. Williams ſaid, that another printer, Mr. Hamilton, had not waited ſo long as Mr. Strahan, but had kept his coach ſeveral years ſooner. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He was in the right. Life is ſhort. The ſooner that a man begins to enjoy his wealth the better."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Elphinſton talked of a new book that was much admired, and aſked Dr. Johnſon if he had read it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I have looked into it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"What (ſaid Elphinſton,) have you not read it through?"</q> Johnſon, offended at being thus preſſed, and ſo obliged to own his curſory mode of reading, anſwered tartly, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; do <hi>you</hi> read books <hi>through?"</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He this day again defended duelling, and put his argument upon what I have ever thought the moſt ſolid baſis; that if publick war be allowed to be conſiſtent with morality, private war muſt be equally ſo. Indeed we may obſerve what ſtrained arguments are uſed, to reconcile war with the Chriſtian religion. But, in my opinion, it is exceedingly clear that duelling having better reaſons for its barbarous violence, is more juſtifiable than war, in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0548300101:432" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which thouſands go forth without any cauſe of perſonal quarrel, and maſſacre each other.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 21, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's. A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man attacked Garrick for being vain. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No wonder, Sir, that he is vain; a man who is perpetually flattered in every mode that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. So many bellows have blown the fire, that one wonders he is not by this time become a cinder."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And ſuch bellows too. Lord Mansfield with his cheeks like to burſt: Lord Chatham like an Aeolus. I have read ſuch notes from them to him as were enough to turn his head."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"True. When he whom every body elſe flatters, flatters me, I then am truly happy."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"The ſentiment is in Congreve, I think."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Madam, in 'The Way of the World:'
<q>
                        <l>'If there's delight in love, 'tis when I ſee</l>
                        <l>'That heart which others bleed for, bleed for me.'</l>
                     </q>
No, Sir, I ſhould not be ſurprized though Garrick chained the ocean, and laſhed the winds."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Should it not be, Sir, laſhed the ocean and chained the winds?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; recollect the original:<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>'In Corum atque Eurum ſolitus ſaevire flagellis</l>
                           <l>'Barbarus, Aeolio nunquam hoc in carcere paſſos,</l>
                           <l>'Ipſum compedibus qui vinxerat Eunoſigaeum."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This does very well, when both the winds and the ſea are perſonified, and mentioned by their mythological names, as in Juvenal; but when they are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in plain language, the application of the epithets ſuggeſted by me, is the moſt obvious; and accordingly my friend himſelf, in his imitation of the paſſage which deſcribes Xerxes, has
<q>
                     <l>"The waves he laſhes, and enchains the wind."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The modes of living in different countries, and the various views with which men travel in queſt of new ſcenes, having been talked of, a learned gentleman who holds a conſiderable office in the law, expatiated on the happineſs of a ſavage life; and mentioned an inſtance of an officer who had actually lived for ſome time in the wilds of America, of whom, when in that ſtate, he quoted this reflection with an air of admiration, as if it had been deeply philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical: <q rend="inline">"Here am I, free and unreſtrained, amidſt the rude magnificence of Nature, with this Indian woman by my ſide, and this gun, with which I can
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0548300101:433" rendition="simple:additions"/> procure food when I want it: what more can be deſired for human happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?"</q> It did not require much ſagacity to foreſee that ſuch a ſentiment would not be permitted to paſs without due animadverſion. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Do not allow yourſelf, Sir, to be impoſed upon by ſuch groſs abſurdity. It is ſad ſtuff; it is brutiſh. If a bull could ſpeak, he might as well exclaim,—Here am I with this cow and this graſs; what being can enjoy greater felicity?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the melancholy end of a gentleman who had deſtroyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It was owing to imaginary difficulties in his affairs, which, had he talked with any friend, would ſoon have vaniſhed."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Do you think, Sir, that all who commit ſuicide are mad?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they are often not univerſally diſordered in their intellects, but one paſſion preſſes ſo upon them that they yield to it, and commit ſuicide, as a paſſionate man will ſtab another."</q> He added, <q rend="inline">"I have often thought, that after a man has taken the reſolution to kill himſelf, it is not courage in him to do any thing, however deſperate, becauſe he has nothing to fear."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"I don't ſee that."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay but, my dear Sir, why ſhould not you ſee what every one elſe ſees?"</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"It is for fear of ſomething that he has reſolved to kill himſelf; and will not that timid diſpoſition reſtrain him?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It does not ſignify that the fear of ſomething made him reſolve; it is upon the ſtate of his mind after the reſolution is taken, that I argue. Suppoſe a man, either from fear, or pride, or conſcience, or whatever motive, has reſolved to kill himſelf; when once the reſolution is taken, he has nothing to fear. He may then go and take the King of Pruſſia by the noſe, at the head of his army. He cannot fear the rack, who is reſolved to kill himſelf. When Euſtace Budgel was walking down to the Thames deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to drown himſelf, he might, if he pleaſed, without any apprehenſion of danger, have turned aſide, and firſt ſet fire to St. James's palace."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, April 27, Mr. Beauclerk and I called on him in the morning. As we walked up Johnſon's-court, I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have a veneration for this court;"</q> and was glad to find that Beauclerk had the ſame reverential enthuſiaſm. We found him alone. We talked of Mr. Andrew Stuart's elegant and plauſible Letters to Lord Mansfield; a copy of which had been ſent by the authour to Dr. Johnſon. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They have not anſwered the end. They have not been talked of: I have never heard of them. This is owing to their not being ſold. People ſeldom read a book which is given to them; and few are given. The way to ſpread a work is to ſell it at a low price. No man will ſend to buy a thing that coſts even ſix-pence, without an intention to read it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"May it not be doubted, Sir, whether it be proper to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0548300101:434"/>
publiſh letters, arraigning the ultimate deciſion of an important cauſe by the ſupreme judicature of the nation?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I do not think it was wrong to publiſh theſe letters. If they are thought to do harm, why not anſwer them? But they will do no harm. If Mr. Douglas be indeed the ſon of Lady Jane, he cannot be hurt: if he be not her ſon, and yet has the great eſtate of the family of Douglas, he may well ſubmit to have a pamphlet againſt him by Andrew Stuart. Sir, I think ſuch a publication does good, as it does good to ſhew us the poſſibilities of human life. And, Sir, you will not ſay that the Douglas cauſe was a cauſe of eaſy deciſion, when it divided your Court as much as it could do, to be determined at all. When your Judges were ſeven and ſeven, the caſting vote of the Preſident muſt be given on one ſide or other; no matter, for my argument, on which; one or the other <hi>muſt</hi> be taken; as when I am to move, there is no matter which leg I move firſt. And then, Sir, it was otherwiſe determined here. No, Sir, a more dubious determination of any queſtion cannot be imagined <note n="6" place="bottom">I regretted that Dr. Johnſon never took the trouble to ſtudy a queſtion which intereſted nations. He would not even read a pamphlet which I wrote upon it, entitled <q rend="inline">"The Eſſence of the Douglas Cauſe,"</q> which, I have reaſon to flatter myſelf, had conſiderable effect in favour of Mr. Douglas; of whoſe legitimate filiation I was then, and am ſtill, firmly convinced. Let me add, that no fact can be more reſpectably aſcertained, than by a judgement of the moſt auguſt tribunal in the world; a judgement, in which Lord Mansfield and Lord Camden united in 1769, and from which only five of a numerous body entered a proteſt.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Goldſmith ſhould not be for ever attempting to ſhine in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: he has not temper for it, he is ſo much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes is compoſed partly of ſkill, partly of chance. A man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's putting himſelf againſt another, is like a man laying a hundred to one who cannot ſpare the hundred. It is not worth a man's while. A man ſhould not lay a hundred to one, unleſs he can eaſily ſpare it, though he has a hundred chances for him: he can get but a guinea, and he may loſe a hundred. Goldſmith is in this ſtate. When he contends, if he gets the better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation: if he does not get the better, he is miſerably vexed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon's own ſuperlative power of wit ſet him above any riſk of ſuch uneaſineſs. Garrick had remarked to me of him, a few days before, <q rend="inline">"Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais and all other wits are nothing compared with him. You may be diverted by them; but Johnſon gives you a forcible hug, and ſhakes laughter out of you, whether you will or no."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:0548300101:435"/> Goldſmith, however, was often very fortunate in his witty conteſts, even when he entered the liſts with Johnſon himſelf. Sir Joſhua Reynolds was in company with them one day, when Goldſmith ſaid, that he thought he could write a good fable, mentioned the ſimplicity which that kind of compoſition requires, and obſerved, that in moſt fables the animals introduced ſeldom talk in character. <q rend="inline">"For inſtance, (ſaid he,) the fable of the little fiſhes, who ſaw birds fly over their heads, and envying them, petitioned Jupiter to be changed into birds. The ſkill (continued he,) conſiſts in making them talk like little fiſhes."</q> While he indulged himſelf in this fanciful reverie, he obſerved Johnſon ſhaking his ſides, and laughing. Upon which he ſmartly proceeded, <q rend="inline">"Why, Dr. Johnſon, this is not ſo eaſy as you ſeem to think; for if you were to make little fiſhes talk, they would talk like WHALES."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon, though remarkable for his great variety of compoſition, never exerciſed his talents in fable, except we allow his beautiful tale publiſhed in Mrs. Williams's Miſcellanies to be of that ſpecies. I have, however, found among his manuſcript collections the following ſketch of one:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Glow-worm lying in the garden ſaw a candle in a neighbouring palace,—and complained of the littleneſs of his own light;—another obſerved—wait a little;—ſoon dark;—have outlaſted <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>[many]</hi> of theſe glaring lights which only are brighter as they haſte to nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 29, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, where were Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Dr. Goldſmith, and Mr. Thrale. I was very deſirous to get Dr. Johnſon abſolutely fixed in his reſolution to go with me to the Hebrides this year; and I told him that I had received a letter from Dr. Robertſon the hiſtorian upon the ſubject, with which he was much pleaſed, and now talked in ſuch a manner of his long-intended tour, that I was ſatisfied he meant to fulfil his engagement.</p>
               <p>The cuſtom of eating dogs at Otaheite being mentioned, Goldſmith obſerved, that this was alſo a cuſtom in China; that a dog-butcher is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon there as any other butcher; and that when he walks abroad all the dogs fall on him. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is not owing to his killing dogs, Sir. I remember a butcher at Lichfield, whom a dog that was in the houſe where I lived, always attacked. It is the ſmell of carnage which provokes this, let the animals he has killed be what they may."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Yes, there is a general abhorrence in animals at the ſigns of maſſacre. If you put a tub full of blood into a ſtable, the horſes are like to go mad."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I doubt that."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is a fact well authenticated."</q> THRALE. <q rend="inline">"You had better prove it before you put it into your book on natural hiſtory.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0548300101:436"/>
You may do it in my ſtable if you will."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I would not have him prove it. If he is content to take his information from others, he may get through his book with little trouble, and without much endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reputation. But if he makes experiments for ſo comprehenſive a book as his, there would be no end to them; his erroneous aſſertions would then fall upon himſelf; and he might be blamed for not having made experiments as to every particular."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The character of Mallet having been introduced, and ſpoken of ſlightingly by Goldſmith; JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, Mallet had talents enough to keep his lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary reputation alive as long as he himſelf lived; and that, let me tell you, is a good deal."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"But I cannot agree that it was ſo. His literary reputation was dead long before his natural death. I conſider an authour's lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary reputation to be alive only while his name will enſure a good price for his copy from the bookſellers. I will get you (to Johnſon,) a hundred guineas for any thing whatever that you ſhall write, if you put your name to it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Goldſmith's new play, <q rend="inline">"She ſtoops to conquer,"</q> being mentioned; JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I know of no comedy for many years that has ſo much exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated an audience, that has anſwered ſo much the great end of comedy,—making an audience merry."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Goldſmith having ſaid, that Garrick's compliment to the Queen, which he introduced into the play of 'The Chances,' which he had altered and reviſed this year, was mean and groſs flattery;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I would not <hi>write,</hi> I would not give ſolemnly under my hand a character beyond what I thought really true; but a ſpeech on the ſtage, let it flatter ever ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, is formular. It has always been formular to flatter Kings and Queens; ſo much ſo, that even in our church-ſervice we have 'our moſt religious King,' uſed indiſcriminately, whoever is King. Nay, they even flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;—'we have been graciouſly pleaſed to grant.'—No modern flattery, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is ſo groſs as that of the Auguſtan age, where the Emperour was deified. <hi>'Praeſens Divus habebitur Auguſtus.'</hi> And as to meanneſs, (riſing into warmth,) how is it mean in a player,—a ſhowman,—a fellow who exhibits himſelf for a ſhilling, to flatter his Queen? The attempt, indeed, was dangerous; for if it had miſſed, what became of Garrick, and what became of the Queen? As Sir William Temple ſays of a great General, it is neceſſary not only that his deſigns ſhould be formed in a maſterly manner, but that they ſhould be attended with ſucceſs. Sir, it is right, at a time when the Royal Family is not generally liked, to let it be ſeen that the people like at leaſt one of them."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"I do not perceive why the profeſſion of a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0548300101:437" rendition="simple:additions"/> player ſhould be deſpiſed; for the great and ultimate end of all the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind is to produce amuſement. Garrick produces more amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than any body."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You ſay, Dr. Johnſon, that Garrick exhibits himſelf for a ſhilling. In this reſpect he is only on a footing with a lawyer who exhibits himſelf for his fee, and even will maintain any nonſenſe or abſurdity, if the caſe requires it. Garrick refuſes a play or a part which he does not like; a lawyer never refuſes."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, what does this prove? only that a lawyer is worſe.

               <p>On Friday, April 30, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk's, where were Lord Charlemont, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, and ſome more members of the Literary Club, whom he had obligingly invited to meet me, as I was this evening to be balloted for as candidate for admiſſion into that diſtinguiſhed ſociety.

               <p>Goldſmith being mentioned;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is amazing how little Goldſmith knows. He ſeldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one elſe."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"Yet there is no man whoſe company is more liked."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure, Sir. When people find a man of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed abilities as a writer, their inferiour while he is with them, it muſt be highly gratifying to them. What Goldſmith comically ſays of himſelf is very true,—he always gets the better when he argues alone;—meaning, that he is maſter of a ſubject in his ſtudy, and can write well upon it; but when he comes into company, grows confuſed, and unable to talk. Take him as a poet, his 'Traveller' is a very fine performance; aye, and ſo is his 'Deſerted Village,' were it not ſometimes too much the echo of his 'Traveller.' Whether, indeed, we take him as a poet,—as a comick writer,—or as an hiſtorian, he ſtands in the firſt claſs."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"An hiſtorian! My dear Sir, you ſurely will not rank his compilation of the Roman Hiſtory with the works of other hiſtorians of this age?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, who are before him?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Hume,—Robertſon,—Lord Lyttelton."</q> JOHNSON. (His anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to the Scotch beginning to riſe,) <q rend="inline">"I have not read Hume; but, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Goldſmith's Hiſtory is better than the <hi>verbiage</hi> of Robertſon, or the foppery of Dalrymple."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Will you not admit the ſuperiority of Robertſon,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0548300101:438"/>
in whoſe Hiſtory we find ſuch penetration,—ſuch painting?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you muſt conſider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not hiſtory, it is imagination. He who deſcribes what he never ſaw, draws from fancy. Robertſon paints minds as Sir Joſhua paints faces in a hiſtory-piece: he imagines an heroick countenance. You muſt look upon Robertſon's work as romance, and try it by that ſtandard. Hiſtory it is not. Beſides, Sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold. Goldſmith has done this in his Hiſtory. Now Robertſon might have put twice as much into his book. Robertſon is like a man who has packed gold in wool: the wool takes up more room than the gold. No, Sir; I always thought Robertſon would be cruſhed by his own weight,—would be buried under his own ornaments. Goldſmith tells you ſhortly all you want to know: Robertſon detains you a great deal too long. No man will read Robertſon's cumbrous detail a ſecond time; but Goldſmith's plain narrative will pleaſe again and again. I would ſay to Robertſon what an old tutor of a College ſaid to one of his pupils: 'Read over your compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and wherever you meet with a paſſage which you think is particularly fine, ſtrike it out.' Goldſmith's abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius; and I will venture to ſay, that if you compare him with Vertot, in the ſame places of the Roman Hiſtory, you will find that he excels Vertot. Sir, he has the art of compiling, and of ſaying every thing he has to ſay in a pleaſing manner. He is now writing a Natural Hiſtory, and will make it as entertaining as a Perſian Tale."</q>

               <p>I cannot diſmiſs the preſent topick without obſerving, that it is probable that Dr. Johnſon, who owned that he often <q rend="inline">"talked for victory,"</q> rather urged plauſible objections to Dr. Robertſon's excellent hiſtorical works, in the ardour of conteſt, than expreſſed his real and decided opinion; for it is not eaſy to ſuppoſe, that he ſhould ſo widely differ from the reſt of the literary world.</p>

               <p>A propoſition which had been agitated, that monuments to eminent perſons ſhould, for the time to come, be erected in St. Paul's church as well as in Weſtminſter-abbey, was mentioned; and it was aſked, who ſhould be honoured by having his monument firſt erected there. Somebody ſuggeſted Pope. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as Pope was a Roman Catholick, I would not have his to be firſt. I think Milton's rather ſhould have the precedence.

               <p>Some of the company expreſſed a wonder why the authour of ſo excellent a book as <q rend="inline">"The whole Duty of Man"</q> ſhould conceal himſelf.

He may have been a clergyman, and may have thought that his religious counſels would have leſs weight when known to come from a man whoſe profeſſion was Theology. He may have been a man whoſe practice was not ſuitable to his principles; ſo that his character might injure the effect of his book, which he had written in a ſeaſon of penitence. Or he may have been a man of rigid ſelf-denial, ſo that he would have no reward for his pious labours while in this world, but refer it all to a future ſtate."</q>

In a ſhort time I received the agreeable intelligence that I was choſen. I haſtened to the place of meeting, and was introduced to ſuch a ſociety as can ſeldom be found. Mr. Edmund Burke, whom I then ſaw for the firſt time, and whoſe ſplendid talents had long made me ardently wiſh for his acquaintance; Dr. Nugent, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldſmith, Mr. (now Sir William,) Jones, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with whom I had dined.

               <p>We drank tea with Mrs. Williams. I introduced a queſtion which has been much agitated in the Church of Scotland, whether the claim of lay-patrons to preſent miniſters to pariſhes be well founded; and ſuppoſing it to be well founded, whether it ought to be exerciſed without the concurrence of the people? That Church is compoſed of a ſeries of judicatures: a Preſbytery,—a Synod,—and, finally, a General Aſſembly; before all of which, this matter may be contended: and in ſome caſes the Preſbytery having refuſed to induct or <hi>ſettle,</hi> as they call it, the perſon preſented by the patron, it has been found neceſſary to appeal to the General Aſſembly. He ſaid, I might ſee the ſubject
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0548300101:441"/> well treated in the <q rend="inline">"Defence of Pluralities;"</q> and although he thought that a patron ſhould exerciſe his right with tenderneſs to the inclinations of the people of a pariſh, he was very clear as to his right. Then ſuppoſing the queſtion to be pleaded before the General Aſſembly, he dictated to me what follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>AGAINST the right of patrons is commonly oppoſed, by the inferiour judicatures, the plea of conſcience. Their conſcience tells them, that the people ought to chooſe their paſtor; their conſcience tells them that they ought not to impoſe upon a congregation a miniſter ungrateful and unaccept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his auditors. Conſcience is nothing more than a conviction felt by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of ſomething to be done, or ſomething to be avoided; and, in queſtions of ſimple unperplexed morality, conſcience is very often a guide that may be truſted. But before conſcience can determine, the ſtate of the queſtion is ſuppoſed to be completely known. In queſtions of law, or of fact, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is very often confounded with opinion. No man's conſcience can tell him the rights of another man: they muſt be known by rational inveſtigation or hiſtorical enquiry. Opinion, which he that holds it may call his conſcience, may teach ſome men that religion would be promoted, and quiet preſerved, by granting to the people univerſally the choice of their miniſters. But it is a conſcience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of another. Religion cannot be promoted by injuſtice: and it was never yet found that a popular election was very quietly tranſacted.</p>
                  <p>That juſtice would be violated by transferring to the people the right of patronage, is apparent to all who know whence that right had its original. The right of patronage was not at firſt a privilege torne by power from unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting poverty. It is not an authority at firſt uſurped in times of ignorance, and eſtabliſhed only by ſucceſſion and by precedents. It is not a grant capriciouſly made from a higher tyrant to a lower. It is a right dearly purchaſed by the firſt poſſeſſors, and juſtly inherited by thoſe that ſucceeded them. When Chriſtianity was eſtabliſhed in this iſland, a regular mode of publick worſhip was preſcribed. Publick worſhip requires a publick place; and the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of lands, as they were converted, built churches for their families and their vaſſals. For the maintenance of miniſters, they ſettled a certain portion of their lands; and a diſtrict, through which each miniſter was required to extend his care, was, by that circumſcription, conſtituted a pariſh. This is a poſition ſo generally received in England, that the extent of a manor and of a pariſh are regularly received for each other. The churches which the proprietors of lands had thus built and thus endowed, they juſtly thought themſelves entitled to provide with miniſters; and where the epiſcopal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0548300101:442"/>
prevails, the Biſhop has no power to reject a man nominated by the patron, but for ſome crime that might exclude him from the prieſthood. For the endowment of the church being the gift of the landlord, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently at liberty to give it according to his choice, to any man capable of performing the holy offices. The people did not chooſe him, becauſe the people did not pay him.</p>
                  <p>We hear it ſometimes urged, that this original right is paſſed out of memory, and is obliterated and obſcured by many tranſlations of property and changes of government; that ſcarce any church is now in the hands of the heirs of the builders; and that the preſent perſons have entered ſubſequently upon the pretended rights by a thouſand accidental and unknown cauſes. Much of this, perhaps, is true. But how is the right of patronage extinguiſhed? If the right followed the lands, it is poſſeſſed by the ſame equity by which the lands are poſſeſſed. It is, in effect, part of the manor, and protected by the ſame laws with every other privilege. Let us ſuppoſe an eſtate forfeited by treaſon, and granted by the Crown to a new family. With the lands were forfeited all the rights appendant to thoſe lands; by the ſame power that grants the lands, the rights alſo are granted. The right loſt to the patron falls not to the people, but is either retained by the Crown, or, what to the people is the ſame thing, is by the Crown given away. Let it change hands ever ſo often, it is poſſeſſed by him that receives it with the ſame right as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed. It may, indeed, like all our poſſeſſions, be forcibly ſeized or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently obtained. But no injury is ſtill done to the people; for what they never had, they have never loſt. Caius may uſurp the right of Titius; but neither Caius nor Titius injure the people: and no man's conſcience, however tender or however active, can prompt him to reſtore what may be proved to have been never taken away. Suppoſing, what I think cannot be proved, that a popular election of miniſters were to be deſired, our deſires are not the meaſure of equity. It were to be deſired that power ſhould be only in the hands of the merciful, and riches in the poſſeſſion of the generous; but the law muſt leave both riches and power where it finds them; and muſt often leave riches with the covetous, and power with the cruel. Convenience may be a rule in little things, where no other rule has been eſtabliſhed. But as the great end of government is to give every man his own, no inconvenience is greater than that of making right uncertain. Nor is any man more an enemy to publick peace, than he who fills weak heads with imaginary claims, and breaks the ſeries of civil ſubordination, by inciting the lower claſſes of mankind to encroach upon the higher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:0548300101:443"/>
Having thus ſhewn that the right of patronage, being originally purchaſed, may be legally transferred, and that it is now in the hands of lawful poſſeſſors, at leaſt as certainly as any other right, we have left to the advocates of the people no other plea than that of convenience. Let us, therefore, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the people would really gain by a general abolition of the right of patronage. What is moſt to be deſired by ſuch a change is, that the country ſhould be ſupplied with better miniſters. But why ſhould we ſuppoſe that the pariſh will make a wiſer choice than the patron? If we ſuppoſe mankind actuated by intereſt, the patron is more likely to chooſe with caution, becauſe he will ſuffer more by chooſing wrong. By the deficiencies of his miniſter, or by his vices, he is equally offended with the reſt of the congregation; but he will have this reaſon more to lament them, that they will be imputed to his abſurdity or corruption. The qualifications of a miniſter are well known to be learning and piety. Of his learning the patron is probably the only judge in the pariſh; and of his piety not leſs a judge than others; and is more likely to inquire minutely and diligently before he gives a preſentation, than one of the parochial rabble, who can give nothing but a vote. It may be urged, that though the pariſh might not chooſe better miniſters, they would at leaſt chooſe miniſters whom they like better, and who would therefore officiate with greater efficacy. That ignorance and perverſeneſs ſhould always obtain what they like, was never conſidered as the end of government; of which it is the great and ſtanding benefit, that the wiſe ſee for the ſimple, and the regular act for the capricious. But that this argument ſuppoſes the people capable of judging, and reſolute to act according to their beſt judgements, though this be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently abſurd, is not all its abſurdity. It ſuppoſes not only wiſdom, but unanimity in thoſe, who upon no other occaſions are unanimous or wiſe. If by ſome ſtrange concurrence all the voices of a pariſh ſhould unite in the choice of any ſingle man, though I could not charge the patron with injuſtice for preſenting a miniſter, I ſhould cenſure him as unkind and injudicious. But, it is evident, that as in all other popular elections there will be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of judgement and acrimony of paſſion, a pariſh upon every vacancy would break into factions, and the conteſt for the choice of a miniſter would ſet neighbours at variance and bring diſcord into families. The miniſter would be taught all the arts of a candidate, would flatter ſome and bribe others; and the electors, as in all other caſes, would call for holidays and ale, and break the heads of each other during the jollity of the canvas. The time muſt, however, come at laſt, when one of the factions muſt prevail, and one of the miniſters get poſſeſſion of the church. On what terms does he enter
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0548300101:444" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon his miniſtry but thoſe of enmity with half his pariſh? By what prudence or what diligence can he hope to conciliate the affections of that party by whoſe defeat he has obtained his living? Every man who voted againſt him will enter the church with hanging head and downcaſt eyes, afraid to encounter that neighbour by whoſe vote and influence he has been overpowered. He will hate his neighbour for oppoſing him, and his miniſter for having proſpered by the oppoſition; and, as he will never ſee him but with pain, he will never ſee him but with hatred. Of a miniſter preſented by the patron, the pariſh has ſeldom any thing worſe to ſay than that they do not know him. Of a miniſter choſen by a popular conteſt, all thoſe who do not favour him have nurſed up in their boſoms principles of hatred and reaſons of rejection. Anger is excited principally by pride. The pride of a common man is very little exaſperated by the ſuppoſed uſurpation of an acknowledged ſuperiour. He bears only his little ſhare of a general evil, and ſuffers in common with the whole pariſh: but when the conteſt is between equals, the defeat has many aggravations; and he that is defeated by his next neighbour is ſeldom ſatisfied without ſome revenge: and it is hard to ſay what bitterneſs of malignity would prevail in a pariſh where theſe elections ſhould happen to be frequent, and the enmity of oppoſition ſhould be re-kindled before it had cooled.</p>

               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I am well aſſured that the people of Otaheite who have the bread-tree, the fruit of which ſerves them for bread, laughed heartily when they were informed of the tedious proceſs neceſſary with us to have bread;—plowing, ſowing, harrowing, reaping, threſhing, grinding, baking."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, all ignorant ſavages will laugh when they are told of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0548300101:446" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the advantages of civilized life. Were you to tell men who live without houſes, how we pile brick upon brick and rafter upon rafter, and that after a houſe is raiſed to a certain height, a man tumbles off a ſcaffold and breaks his neck, he would laugh heartily at our folly in building; but it does not follow that men are better without houſes. No, Sir, (holding up a ſlice of a good loaf,) this is better than the bread-tree."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He repeated an argument, which is to be found in his <q rend="inline">"Rambler,"</q> againſt the notion that the brute creation is endowed with the faculty of reaſon: <q rend="inline">"birds build by inſtinct; they never improve: they build their firſt neſt as well as any one that they ever build."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"Yet we ſee if you take away a bird's neſt with the eggs in it, ſhe will make a ſlighter neſt and lay again."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that is becauſe at firſt ſhe has full time, and makes her neſt deliberately. In the caſe you mention ſhe is preſſed to lay, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make her neſt quickly, and conſequently it will be ſlight."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"The nidification of birds is what is leaſt known in natural hiſtory, though one of the moſt curious things in it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I introduced the ſubject of toleration. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Every ſociety has a right to preſerve publick peace and order, and therefore has a good right to prohibit the propagation of opinions which have a dangerous tendency. To ſay the <hi>magiſtrate</hi> has this right, is uſing an inadequate word: it is the <hi>ſociety</hi> for which the magiſtrate is agent. He may be morally or theologically wrong in reſtraining the propagation of opinions which he thinks dangerous, but he is politically right."</q> MAYO. <q rend="inline">"I am of opinion, Sir, that every man is entitled to liberty of conſcience in religion; and that the magiſtrate cannot reſtrain that right."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I agree with you. Every man has a right to liberty of conſcience, and with that the magiſtrate cannot interfere. People confound liberty of thinking with liberty of talking; nay, with liberty of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Every man has a phyſical right to think as he pleaſes; for it cannot be diſcovered how he thinks. He has not a moral right; for he ought to inform himſelf and think juſtly. But, Sir, no member of a ſociety has a right to <hi>teach</hi> any doctrine contrary to what that ſociety holds to be true. The magiſtrate, I ſay, may be wrong in what he thinks; but, while he thinks himſelf right, he may, and ought to enforce what he thinks."</q> MAYO. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, we are to remain always in errour, and truth never can prevail; and the magiſtrate was right in perſecuting the firſt Chriſtians."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the only method by which religious truth can be eſtabliſhed is by martyrdom. The magiſtrate has a right to enforce what he thinks; and he who is conſcious of the truth has a right to ſuffer. I am afraid there is no other way of aſcertaining the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0548300101:447"/> truth, but by perſecution on the one hand and enduring it on the other."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"But how is a man to act, Sir? Though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrine, may he not think it wrong to expoſe himſelf to perſecution? Has he a right to do ſo? Is it not, as it were, committing voluntary ſuicide?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, as to voluntary ſuicide, as you call it, there are twenty thouſand men in an army who will go without ſcruple to be ſhot at, and mount a breach for five-pence a day."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"But have they a moral right to do this?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, if you will not take the univerſal opinion of mankind, I have nothing to ſay. If mankind cannot defend their own way of thinking, I cannot defend it. Sir, if a man is in doubt whether it would be better for him to expoſe himſelf to martyrdom or not, he ſhould not do it. He muſt be convinced that he has a delegation from heaven."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"I would conſider whether there is the greater chance of good or evil upon the whole. If I ſee a man who has fallen into a well, I would wiſh to help him out; but if there is a greater probability that he ſhall pull me in, than that I ſhall pull him out, I would not attempt it. So were I to go to Turkey, I might wiſh to convert the Grand Signor to the Chriſtian faith; but when I conſidered that I ſhould probably be put to death without effectuating my purpoſe in any degree, I ſhould keep myſelf quiet."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you muſt conſider that we have perfect and imperfect obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. Perfect obligations, which are generally not to do ſomething, are clear and poſitive; as, 'thou ſhalt not kill.' But charity, for inſtance, is not definable by limits. It is a duty to give to the poor; but no man can ſay how much another ſhould give to the poor, or when a man has given too little to ſave his ſoul. In the ſame manner, it is a duty to inſtruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and of conſequence to convert infidels to Chriſtianity; but no man in the common courſe of things is obliged to carry this to ſuch a degree as to incur the danger of martyrdom, as no man is obliged to ſtrip himſelf to the ſhirt in order to give charity. I have ſaid, that a man muſt be perſuaded that he has a particular delegation from heaven."</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">"How is this to be known? Our firſt reformers, who were burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST."</q>—JOHNSON. (interrupting him,) <q rend="inline">"Sir, they were not burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST, but for inſulting thoſe who did believe it. And, Sir, when the firſt reformers began, they did not intend to be martyred: as many of them ran away as could."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, there was your countryman, Elwal, who you told me challenged King George with his black-guards and his red-guards."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"My countryman, Elwal, Sir, ſhould have been put in the ſtocks; a proper pulpit
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0548300101:448"/>
for him, and he'd have had a numerous audience. A man who preaches in the ſtocks will always have hearers enough."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But Elwal thought himſelf in the right."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We are not providing for mad people; there are places for them in the neighbourhood,"</q> (meaning Moorfields.) MAYO. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, is it not very hard that I ſhould not be allowed to teach my children what I really believe to be the truth?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you might contrive to teach your children <hi>extrà ſcandalum;</hi> but, Sir, the magiſtrate, if he knows it, has a right to reſtrain you. Suppoſe you teach your children to be thieves?"</q> MAYO. <q rend="inline">"This is making a joke of the ſubject."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, take it thus:—that you teach them the community of goods, for which there are as many plauſible arguments as for moſt erroneous doctrines. You teach them that all things at firſt were in common, and that no man had a right to any thing but as he laid his hands upon it; and that this ſtill is, or ought to be, the rule amongſt mankind. Here, Sir, you ſap a great principle in ſociety,—property. And don't you think the magiſtrate would have a right to prevent you? Or, ſuppoſe you ſhould teach your children the notions of the Adamites, and they ſhould run naked into the ſtreets, would not the magiſtrate have a right to flog 'em into their doublets?"</q> MAYO. <q rend="inline">"I think the magiſtrate has no right to interfere till there is ſome overt act."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, though he ſees an enemy to the ſtate charging a blunderbuſs, he is not to interfere till it is fired off."</q> MAYO. <q rend="inline">"He muſt be ſure of its direction againſt the ſtate."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The magiſtrate is to judge of that.—He has no right to reſtrain your thinking, becauſe the evil centers in yourſelf. If a man were ſitting at this table, and chopping off his fingers, the magiſtrate, as guardian of the community, has no authority to reſtrain him, however he might do it from kindneſs as a parent.—Though, indeed, upon more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I think he may; as it is probable that he who is chopping off his own fingers, may ſoon proceed to chop off thoſe of other people. If I think it right to ſteal Mr. Dilly's plate, I am a bad man; but he can ſay nothing to me. If I make an open declaration that I think ſo, he will keep me out of his houſe. If I put forth my hand, I ſhall be ſent to Newgate. This is the gradation of thinking, preaching, and acting: if a man thinks erroneouſly, he may keep his thoughts to himſelf, and nobody will trouble him; if he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eaches erroneous doctrine, ſociety may expel him; if he acts in conſequence of it, the law takes place, and he is hanged."</q> MAYO. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, ought not Chriſtians to have liberty of conſcience?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I have already told you ſo, Sir. You are coming back to where you were."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Dr. Mayo is always taking a return poſt-chaiſe, and going the ſtage over again.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0548300101:449"/>
 He has it at half price."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Dr. Mayo, like other champions for unlimited toleration, has got a ſet of words <note n="9" place="bottom">Dr. Mayo's calm temper and ſteady perſeverance, rendered him an admirable ſubject for the exerciſe of Dr. Johnſon's powerful abilities. He never flinched; but, after reiterated blows, remained ſeemingly unmoved as at the firſt. The ſcintillations of Johnſon's genius flaſhed every time he was ſtruck, without his receiving any injury. Hence he obtained the epithet of THE LITERARY ANVIL.</note>. Sir, it is no matter, politically, whether the magiſtrate be right or wrong. Suppoſe a club were to be formed to drink confuſion to King George the Third, and a happy reſtoration to Charles the Third; this would be very bad with reſpect to the ſtate; but every member of that club muſt either conform to its rules, or be turned out of it. Old Baxter, I remember, maintains, that the magiſtrate ſhould 'tolerate all things that are tolerable.' This is no good definition of toleration upon any principle; but it ſhews that he thought ſome things were not tolerable."</q> TOPLADY. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have untwiſted this difficult ſubject with great dexterity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>During this argument, Goldſmith ſat in reſtleſs agitation, from a wiſh to get in, and ſhine. Finding himſelf excluded, he had taken his hat to go away, but remained for ſome time with it in his hand, like a gameſter, who at the cloſe of a long night, lingers for a little while, to ſee if he can have a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opening to finiſh with ſucceſs. Once when he was beginning to ſpeak, he found himſelf overpowered by the loud voice of Johnſon, who was at the oppoſite end of the table, and did not perceive Goldſmith's attempt. Thus diſappointed of his wiſh to obtain the attention of the company, Goldſmith in a paſſion threw down his hat, looking angrily at Johnſon, and exclaiming in a bitter tone, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Take it."</hi>
                  </q> When Toplady was going to ſpeak, Johnſon uttered ſome ſound, which led Goldſmith to think that he was beginning again, and taking the words from Toplady. Upon which, he ſeized this opportunity of venting his own envy and ſpleen, under the pretext of ſupporting another perſon: <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he to Johnſon,) the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour; pray allow us now to hear him."</q> JOHNSON. (ſternly,) <q rend="inline">"Sir, I was not interrupting the gentleman. I was only giving him a ſignal of my attention. Sir, you are impertinent."</q> Goldſmith made no reply, but continued in the company for ſome time.</p>
               <p>A gentleman preſent ventured to aſk Dr. Johnſon if there was not a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial difference as to toleration of opinions which lead to action, and opinions merely ſpeculative; for inſtance, would it be wrong in the magiſtrate to tolerate
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0548300101:450"/>
thoſe who preach againſt the doctrine of the TRINITY. Johnſon was highly offended, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I wonder, Sir, how a gentleman of your piety can introduce this ſubject in a mixed company."</q> He told me afterwards, that the impropriety was, that perhaps ſome of the company might have talked on the ſubject in ſuch terms as would have ſhocked him; or he might have been forced to appear in their eyes a narrow-minded man. The gentleman, with ſubmiſſive deference, ſaid, he had only hinted at the queſtion from a deſire to hear Dr. Johnſon's opinion upon it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir, I think that permitting men to preach any opinion contrary to the doctrine of the eſtabliſhed church, tends, in a certain degree, to leſſen the authority of the church, and, conſequently, to leſſen the influence of religion."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"It may be conſidered, (ſaid the gentleman,) whether it would not be politick to tolerate in ſuch a caſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, we have been talking of <hi>right:</hi> this is another queſtion. <hi>I</hi> think it is <hi>not</hi> politick to tolerate in ſuch a caſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though he did not think it fit that ſo aweful a ſubject ſhould be introduced in a mixed company, and therefore at this time waved the theological queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet his own orthodox belief in the ſacred myſtery of the TRINITY is evinced beyond doubt, by the following paſſage in his private devotions: <q rend="inline">"O LORD, hear my prayers, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake; to whom with thee and the HOLY GHOST, <hi>three perſons and one</hi> GOD, be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen <note n="1" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 40.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Dilly, how does Dr. Leland's 'Hiſtory of Ireland' ſell?"</q> JOHNSON. (Burſting forth with a generous indignation,) <q rend="inline">"The Iriſh are in a moſt unnatural ſtate; for we ſee there the minority prevailing over the majority. There is no inſtance, even in the ten perſecutions, of ſuch ſeverity as that which the Proteſtants of Ireland have exerciſed againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Did we tell them we have conquered them, it would be above board: to puniſh them by confiſcation and other penalties, as rebels, was mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous injuſtice. King William was not their lawful ſovereign: he had not been acknowledged by the parliament of Ireland, when they appeared in arms againſt him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I here ſuggeſted ſomething favourable of the Roman Catholicks. TOPLADY. <q rend="inline">"Does not their invocation of ſaints ſuppoſe omnipreſence in the ſaints?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; it ſuppoſes only pluripreſence; and when ſpirits are diveſted of matter, it ſeems probable that they ſhould ſee with more extent than when in an embodied ſtate. There is, therefore, no approach to an
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0548300101:451"/>
 invaſion of any of the divine attributes, in the invocation of ſaints. But I think it is will-worſhip, and preſumption. I ſee no command for it, and therefore think it is ſafer not to practiſe it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He and Mr. Langton and I went together to the Club, where we found Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, and ſome other members, and amongſt them our friend Goldſmith, who ſat ſilently brooding over Johnſon's reprimand to him after dinner. Johnſon perceived this, and ſaid aſide to ſome of us, <q rend="inline">"I'll make Goldſmith forgive me;"</q> and then called to him in a loud voice, <q rend="inline">"Dr. Goldſmith,—ſomething paſſed to-day where you and I dined; I aſk your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don."</q> Goldſmith anſwered placidly, <q rend="inline">"It muſt be much from you, Sir, that I take ill."</q> And ſo at once the difference was over, and they were on as eaſy terms as ever, and Goldſmith rattled away as uſual.</p>
               <p>In our way to the club to-night, when I regretted that Goldſmith would, upon every occaſion, endeavour to ſhine, by which he often expoſed himſelf, Mr. Langton obſerved, that he was not like Addiſon, who was content with the fame of his writings, and did not aim alſo at excellency in converſation, for which he found himſelf unfit; and that he ſaid to a lady, who complained of his having talked little in company, <q rend="inline">"Madam, I have but nine-pence in ready money, but I can draw for a thouſand pounds."</q> I obſerved, that Goldſmith had a great deal of gold in his cabinet, but, not content with that, was always taking out his purſe. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, and that ſo often an empty purſe!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Goldſmith's inceſſant deſire of being conſpicuous in company, was the occaſion of his ſometimes appearing to ſuch diſadvantage as one ſhould hardly have ſuppoſed poſſible in a man of his genius. When his literary reputation had riſen deſervedly high, and his ſociety was much courted, he became very jealous of the extraordinary attention which was every where paid to Johnſon. One evening, in a circle of wits, he found fault with me for talking of Johnſon as entitled to the honour of unqueſtionable ſuperiority. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) you are for making a monarchy of what ſhould be a republick."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was ſtill more mortified, when talking in a company with fluent vivacity, and, as he flattered himſelf, to the admiration of all who were preſent; a German who ſat next him, and perceived Johnſon rolling himſelf, as if about to ſpeak, ſuddenly ſtopped him, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Stay, ſtay,—Toctor Shonſon is going to ſay ſomething."</q> This was, no doubt, very provoking, eſpecially to one ſo irritable as Goldſmith, who frequently mentioned it with ſtrong expreſſions of indignation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:0548300101:452"/>
It may alſo be obſerved, that Goldſmith was ſometimes content to be treated with an eaſy familiarity, but, upon occaſions, would be conſequential and important. An inſtance of this occurred in a ſmall particular. Johnſon had a way of contracting the names of his friends; as, Beauclerk, Beau; Boſwell, Bozzy; Langton, Lanky; Murphy, Mur; Sheridan, Sherry. I remember one day, when Tom Davies was telling that Dr. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We are all in labour for a name to <hi>Goldy</hi>'s play,"</q> Goldſmith ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that ſuch a liberty ſhould be taken with his name, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have often deſired him not to call me <hi>Goldy."</hi>
                  </q> Tom was remarkably attentive to the moſt minute circumſtance about Johnſon. I recollect his telling me once, on my arrival in London, <q rend="inline">"Sir, our great friend has made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement on his appellation of old Mr. Sheridan. He calls him now <hi>Sherry derry."</hi>

               <p>On Sunday, May 8, I dined with Johnſon at Mr. Langton's, with Dr. Beattie and ſome other company. He deſcanted on the ſubject of Literary Property. <q rend="inline">"There ſeems, (ſaid he,) to be in authours a ſtronger right of property than that by occupancy; a metaphyſical right, a right, as it were, of creation,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0548300101:453" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 which ſhould from its nature be perpetual; but the conſent of nations is againſt it, and indeed reaſon and the intereſts of learning are againſt it; for were it to be perpetual, no book, however uſeful, could be univerſally diffuſed amongſt mankind, ſhould the proprietor take it into his head to reſtrain its circulation. No book could have the advantage of being edited with notes, however neceſſary to its elucidation, ſhould the proprietor perverſely oppoſe it. For the general good of the world, therefore, whatever valuable work has once been created by an authour, and iſſued out by him, ſhould be underſtood as no longer in his power, but as belonging to the publick; at the ſame time the authour is entitled to an adequate reward. This he ſhould have by an excluſive right to his work for a conſiderable number of years."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He attacked Lord Monboddo's ſtrange ſpeculation on the primitive ſtate of human nature; obſerving, <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is all conjecture about a thing uſeleſs, even were it known to be true. Knowledge of all kinds is good. Conjecture, as to things uſeful, is good; but conjecture as to what it would be uſeleſs to know, ſuch as whether men ever went upon all four, is very idle."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, May 9, as I was to ſet out on my return to Scotland next morning, I was deſirous to ſee as much of Dr. Johnſon as I could. But I firſt called on Goldſmith to take leave of him. The jealouſy and envy which, though poſſeſſed of many moſt amiable qualities, he frankly avowed, broke out violently at this interview. Upon another occaſion, when Goldſmith confeſſed himſelf to be of an envious diſpoſition, I contended with Johnſon that we ought not to be angry with him, he was ſo candid in owning it. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) we muſt be angry that a man has ſuch a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance of an odious quality that he cannot keep it within his own breaſt, but it boils over."</q> In my opinion, however, Goldſmith had not more of it than other people have, but only talked of it freely.</p>
               <p>He now ſeemed very angry that Johnſon was going to be a traveller; ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he would be a dead weight for me to carry, and that I ſhould never be able to lug him along through the Highlands and Hebrides."</q> Nor would he patiently allow me to enlarge upon Johnſon's wonderful abilities; but exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Is he like Burke, who winds into a ſubject like a ſerpent?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"But, (ſaid I,) Johnſon is the Hercules who ſtrangled ſerpents in his cradle."</q>

               <p>I dined with Dr. Johnſon at General Paoli's. He was obliged, by incifpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to leave the company early; he appointed me, however, to meet him in the evening at Mr. (now Sir Robert,) Chambers's in the Temple, where he accordingly came, though he continued to be very ill. Chambers, as is common on ſuch occaſions, preſcribed various remedies to him. JOHNSON.
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0548300101:454" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(fretted by pain,) <q rend="inline">"Pr'ythee don't teaze me. Stay till I am well, and then you ſhall tell me how to cure myſelf."</q> He grew better, and talked with a noble enthuſiaſm of keeping up the repreſentation of reſpectable families. His zeal on this ſubject was a circumſtance in his character exceedingly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when it is conſidered that he himſelf had no pretenſions to blood. I heard him once ſay, <q rend="inline">"I have great merit in being zealous for ſubordination and the honours of birth; for I can hardly tell who was my grandfather."</q> He maintained the dignity and propriety of male ſucceſſion, in oppoſition to the opinion of one of our friends, who had that day employed Mr. Chambers to draw his will, deviſing his eſtate to his three ſiſters, in preference to a remote heir male. Johnſon called them three <hi>dowdies,</hi> and ſaid, with as high a ſpirit as the boldeſt Baron in the moſt perfect days of the feudal ſyſtem, <q rend="inline">"An ancient eſtate ſhould always go to males. It is mighty fooliſh to let a ſtranger have it, becauſe he marries your daughter, and takes your name. As for an eſtate newly acquired by trade, you may give it, if you will, to the dog <hi>Towzer,</hi> and let him keep his <hi>own</hi> name."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have known him at times exceedingly diverted at what ſeemed to others a very ſmall ſport. He now laughed immoderately, without any reaſon that we could perceive, at our friend's making his will; called him the <hi>teſtator,</hi> and added, <q rend="inline">"I dare ſay, he thinks he has done a mighty thing. He won't ſtay till he gets home to his ſeat in the country, to produce this wonderful deed: he'll call up the landlord of the firſt inn on the road; and, after a ſuitable preface upon mortality and the uncertainty of life, will tell him that he ſhould not delay making his will; and here, Sir, will he ſay, is my will, which I have juſt made, with the aſſiſtance of one of the ableſt lawyers in the kingdom; and he will read it to him (laughing all the time). He believes he has made this will; but he did not make it: you, Chambers, made it for him. I truſt you have had more conſcience than to make him ſay, 'being of ſound underſtanding;' ha, ha, ha! I hope he has left me a legacy. I'd have his will turned into verſe, like a ballad."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this playful manner did he run on, exulting in his own pleaſantry, which certainly was not ſuch as might be expected from the authour of <q rend="inline">"The Rambler,"</q> but which is here preſerved, that my readers may be acquainted even with the ſlighteſt occaſional characteriſticks of ſo eminent a man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chambers did not by any means reliſh this jocularity upon a matter of which <hi>pars magna fuit,</hi> and ſeemed impatient till he got rid of us. Johnſon could not ſtop his merriment, but continued it all the way till we got without the Temple-gate. He then burſt into ſuch a fit of laughter, that
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0548300101:455" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 he appeared to be almoſt in a convulſion; and, in order to ſupport himſelf, laid hold of one of the poſts at the ſide of the foot-pavement, and ſent forth peals ſo loud, that in the ſilence of the night his voice ſeemed to reſound from Temple-bar to Fleet-ditch.</p>
               <p>This moſt ludicrous exhibition of the aweful, melancholy, and venerable Johnſon, happened well to counteract the feelings of ſadneſs which I uſed to experience when parting with him for a conſiderable time. I accompanied him to his door, where he gave me his bleſſing.</p>
               <p>He records of himſelf this year, <q rend="inline">"Between Eaſter and Whitſuntide, having always conſidered that time as propitious to ſtudy, I attempted to learn the Low Dutch language <note n="3" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 129.</note>."</q> It is to be obſerved, that he here admits an opinion of the human mind being influenced by ſeaſons, which he ridicules in his writings. His progreſs, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"was interrupted by a fever, which, by the imprudent uſe of a ſmall print, left an inflammation in his uſeful eye."</q> We cannot but admire his ſpirit when we know, that amidſt a complication of bodily and mental diſtreſs, he was ſtill animated with the deſire of intellectual improvement. Various notes of his ſtudies appear on different days, in his manuſcript diary of this year; ſuch as, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Inchoavi lectionem Pentateuchi—Finivi lectionem Conf. Fab. Burdonum.—Legi primum actum Troadum.—Legi Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Clerici poſtremam de Pent.</hi>—2 <hi>of Clark's Sermons.—L. Appolonii pugnam Betriciam.—L. centum verſus Homeri."</hi>
                  </q> Let this ſerve as a ſpecimen of what acceſſions of literature he was perpetually infuſing into his mind, while he charged himſelf with idleneſs.</p>
               <p>This year died Mrs. Saluſbury, (mother of Mrs. Thrale,) a lady whom he appears to have eſteemed much, and whoſe memory he honoured with an Epitaph <note n="4" place="bottom">Mrs. Piozzi's Anecdotes of Johnſon, p. 131.</note>.</p>
               <p>In a letter from Edinburgh, dated the 29th of May, I preſſed him to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in his reſolution to make this year the projected viſit to the Hebrides, of which he and I had talked for many years, and which I was confident would afford us much entertainment.</p>

                     <p>Chambers is going a Judge, with ſix thouſand a year, to Bengal. He and I ſhall come down together as far as Newcaſtle, and thence I ſhall eaſily get to Edinburgh. Let me know the exact time when your Courts intermit. I muſt conform a little to Chambers's occaſions, and he muſt conform a little to mine. The time which you ſhall fix, muſt be the common point to which we will come as near as we can. Except this eye, I am very well.</p>
                     <p>Beattie is ſo careſſed, and invited, and treated, and liked, and flattered, by the great, that I can ſee nothing of him. I am in great hope that he will be well provided for, and then we will live upon him at the Mariſchal College, without pity or modeſty.</p>
                     <p>—left the town without taking leave of me, and is gone in deep dudgeon to—. Is not this very childiſh? Where is now my legacy?</p>
                     <p>I hope your dear lady and her dear baby are both well. I ſhall ſee them too when I come; and I have that opinion of your choice, as to ſuſpect that when I have ſeen Mrs. Boſwell, I ſhall be leſs willing to go away.</p>

               <p>His ſtay in Scotland was from the 18th of Auguſt, on which day he arrived, till the 22d of November, when he ſet out on his return to London; and I believe ninety-four days were never paſſed by any man in a more vigorous exertion.</p>
               <p>He came by the way of Berwick upon Tweed to Edinburgh, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a few days, and then went by St. Andrew's, Aberdeen, Inverneſs, and Fort Auguſtus, to the Hebrides, to viſit which was the principal object he had
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0548300101:458"/>
in view. He viſited the iſles of Sky, Raſay, Col, Mull, Inchkenneth, and Icolmkill. He travelled through Argyleſhire by Inveraray, and from thence by Lochlomond and Dunbarton to Glaſgow, then by Loudon to Auchinleck in Ayrſhire, the ſeat of my family, and then by Hamilton, back to Edinburgh, where he again ſpent ſome time. He thus ſaw the four Univerſities of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, its three principal cities, and as much of the Highland and inſular life as was ſufficient for his philoſophical contemplation. I had the pleaſure of accompanying him during the whole of this journey. He was reſpectfully entertained by the great, the learned, and the elegant, wherever he went; nor was he leſs delighted with the hoſpitality which he experienced in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler life.</p>
               <p>His various adventures, and the force and vivacity of his mind, as exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed during this peregrination, upon innumerable topicks, have been faithfully and to the beſt of my abilities diſplayed in my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> to which, as the publick has been pleaſed to honour it by a very extenſive circulation, I beg to refer, as to a ſeparate and remarkable portion of his life, which may be there ſeen in detail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which exhibits as ſtriking a view of his powers in converſation, as his works do of his excellence in writing. Nor can I deny to myſelf the very flattering gratification of inſerting here the character which my friend Mr. Courtenay has been pleaſed to give of that work:</p>

My wife paid him the moſt aſſiduous and reſpectful attention, while he was our gueſt; ſo that I wonder how he diſcovered her wiſhing for his departure. The truth is, that his irregular hours and uncouth habits, ſuch as turning the candles with their heads downwards, when they did not burn bright enough, and letting the wax drop upon the carpet, could not but be diſagreeable to a lady. Beſides, ſhe had not that high admiration of him which was felt by moſt of thoſe who knew him; and what was very natural to a female mind, ſhe thought he had too much influence over her huſband.

I am much better, <hi>novae redeunt in praelia vires;</hi> but I am yet tender, and eaſily diſordered. How happy it was that neither of us were ill in the Hebrides.</p>

                        <p>DR. WEBSTER'S informations were much leſs exact and much leſs determinate than I expected: they are, indeed, much leſs poſitive than, if he can truſt his own book<note n="3" place="bottom">A manuſcript account drawn up by Dr. Webſter of all the pariſhes in Scotland, aſcertaining their length, breadth, number of inhabitants, and diſtinguiſhing Proteſtants and Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. This book had been tranſmitted to government, and Dr. Johnſon ſaw a copy of it in Dr. Webſter's poſſeſſion.</note> which he laid before me, he is able to give.

                        <p>Chambers is either married, or almoſt married, to Miſs Wilton, a girl of ſixteen, exquiſitely beautiful, whom he has, with his lawyer's tongue, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to take her chance with him in the Eaſt.</p>

                     <p>I AM aſhamed to think that ſince I received your letter I have paſſed ſo many days without anſwering it.</p>
                     <p>I think there is no great difficulty in reſolving your doubts. The reaſons for which you are inclined to viſit London, are, I think, not of ſufficient ſtrength to anſwer the objections. That you ſhould delight to come once a
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0548300101:465" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 year to the fountain of intelligence and pleaſure, is very natural; but both information and pleaſure muſt be regulated by propriety. Pleaſure, which cannot be obtained but by unſeaſonable or unſuitable expence, muſt always end in pain; and pleaſure, which muſt be enjoyed at the expence of another's pain, can never be ſuch as a worthy mind can fully delight in.</p>
                     <p>What improvement you might gain by coming to London, you may eaſily ſupply, or eaſily compenſate, by enjoining yourſelf ſome particular ſtudy at home, or opening ſome new avenue to information. Edinburgh is not yet exhauſted; and I am ſure you will find no pleaſure here which can deſerve either that you ſhould anticipate any part of your future fortune, or that you ſhould condemn yourſelf and your lady to penurious frugality for the reſt of the year.</p>
                     <p>I need not tell you what regard you owe to Mrs. Boſwell's entreaties; or how much you ought to ſtudy the happineſs of her who ſtudies yours with ſo much diligence, and of whoſe kindneſs you enjoy ſuch good effects. Life cannot ſubſiſt in ſociety but by reciprocal conceſſions. She permitted you to ramble laſt year, you muſt permit her now to keep you at home.</p>
                     <p>Your laſt reaſon is ſo ſerious, that I am unwilling to oppoſe it. Yet you muſt remember, that your image of worſhipping once a year in a certain place, in imitation of the Jews, is but a compariſon, and <hi>ſimile non eſt idem;</hi> if the annual reſort to Jeruſalem was a duty to the Jews, it was a duty becauſe it was commanded; and you have no ſuch command, therefore no ſuch duty. It may be dangerous to receive too readily, and indulge too fondly, opinions, from which, perhaps, no pious mind is wholly diſengaged, of local ſanctity and local devotion. You know what ſtrange effects they have produced over a great part of the Chriſtian world. I am now writing, and you, when you read this, are reading under the Eye of Omnipreſence.</p>
                     <p>To what degree fancy is to be admitted into religious offices, it would require much deliberation to determine. I am far from intending totally to exclude it. Fancy is a faculty beſtowed by our Creator, and it is reaſonable that all his gifts ſhould be uſed to his glory, that all our faculties ſhould co-operate in his worſhip; but they are to co-operate according to the will of him that gave them, according to the order which his wiſdom has eſtabliſhed. As ceremonies prudential or convenient are leſs obligatory than poſitive ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as bodily worſhip is only the token to others or ourſelves of mental adoration, ſo Fancy is always to act in ſubordination to Reaſon. We may take Fancy for a companion, but muſt follow Reaſon as our guide. We may
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0548300101:466" rendition="simple:additions"/>
allow Fancy to ſuggeſt certain ideas in certain places, but Reaſon muſt always be heard, when ſhe tells us, that thoſe ideas and thoſe places have no natural or neceſſary relation. When we enter a church we habitually recal to mind the duty of adoration, but we muſt not omit adoration for want of a temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe we know, and ought to remember, that the Univerſal Lord is every where preſent; and that, therefore, to come to Jona, or to Jeruſalem, though it may be uſeful, cannot be neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have anſwered your letter, and have not anſwered it negligently. I love you too well to be careleſs when you are ſerious.</p>

                     <p>I WISH you could have looked over my book before the printer, but it could not eaſily be. I ſuſpect ſome miſtakes; but as I deal, perhaps,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0548300101:468" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more in notions than facts, the matter is not great, and the ſecond edition will be mended, if any ſuch there be. The preſs will go on ſlowly for a time, becauſe I am going into Wales to-morrow.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be very ſorry if I appeared to treat ſuch a character as that of Lord Hailes otherwiſe than with high reſpect. I return the ſheets <note n="3" place="bottom">On the cover encloſing them, Dr. Johnſon wrote, <q rend="inline">"If my delay has given any reaſon for ſuppoſing that I have not a very deep ſenſe of the honour done me by aſking my judgement, I am very ſorry."</q>
                        </note>, to which I have done what miſchief I could; and finding it ſo little, thought not much of ſending them. The narrative is clear, lively, and ſhort.</p>
                     <p>I have done worſe to Lord Hailes than by neglecting his ſheets: I have run him in debt. Dr. Horne, the Preſident of Magdalen College in Oxford, wrote to me about three months ago, that he purpoſed to reprint Walton's Lives, and deſired me to contribute to the work: my anſwer was, that Lord Hailes intended the ſame publication; and Dr. Horne has reſigned it to him. His Lordſhip now muſt think ſeriouſly about it.</p>
                     <p>Of poor dear Dr. Goldſmith there is little to be told, more than the papers have made publick. He died of a fever, made, I am afraid, more violent by uneaſineſs of mind. His debts began to be heavy, and all his reſources were exhauſted. Sir Joſhua is of opinion that he owed not leſs than two thouſand pounds. Was ever poet ſo truſted before?</p>
                     <p>You may, if you pleaſe, put the inſcription thus:</p>
                     <p>'Maria Scotorum Regina nata <hi>15</hi>—, a ſuis in exilium acta <hi>15</hi>—, ab hoſpitâ neci data <hi>15</hi>—.' <hi>You muſt find the years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of your ſecond daughter you certainly gave the account yourſelf, though you have forgotten it. While Mrs. Boſwell is well, never doubt of a boy. Mrs. Thrale brought, I think, five girls running, but while I was with you ſhe had a boy.</p>
                     <p>I am obliged to you for all your pamphlets, and of the laſt I hope to make ſome uſe. I made ſome of the former.</p>

 fate. But you will be pleaſed to keep in mind, that my picture is a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a particular ſcene in her hiſtory;—her being forced to reſign her crown, while ſhe was impriſoned in the caſtle of Lochlevin. I muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beg that you will be kind enough to give me an inſcription ſuited to that particular ſcene, or determine which of the two formerly tranſmitted to you is the beſt; and, at any rate, favour me with an Engliſh tranſlation. It will be doubly kind if you comply with my requeſt ſpeedily.</p>
                     <p>Your critical notes on the ſpecimen of Lord Hailes's 'Annals of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,' are excellent. I agreed with you in every one of them. He himſelf objected only to the alteration of <hi>free</hi> to <hi>brave,</hi> in the paſſage where he ſays that Edward <q rend="inline">'departed with the glory due to the conquerour of a free people.'</q> He ſays, <q rend="inline">'to call the Scots brave would only add to the glory of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.'</q> You will make allowance for the national zeal of our annaliſt. I now ſend a few more leaves of the Annals, which I hope you will peruſe, and return with obſervations, as you did upon the former occaſion. Lord Hailes writes to me thus: <q rend="inline">'Mr. Boſwell will be pleaſed to expreſs the grateful ſenſe which Sir David Dalrymple has of Dr. Johnſon's attention to his little ſpecimen. The further ſpecimen will ſhew, that

                     <p>It gives me much pleaſure to hear that a re-publication of Iſaac Walton's Lives is intended. You have been in a miſtake in thinking that Lord Hailes had it in view. I remember one forenoon, while he ſat with you in my houſe, he ſaid, that there ſhould be a new edition of Walton's Lives; and you ſaid, that they ſhould be benoted a little. This was all that paſſed on that ſubject. You muſt, therefore, inform Dr. Horne, that he may reſume his plan. I encloſe a note concerning it; and if Dr. Horne will write to me, all the attention that I can give ſhall be cheerfully beſtowed, upon what I think a pious work, the preſervation and elucidation of Walton, by whoſe writings I have been moſt pleaſingly edified.</p>

                     <p>YESTERDAY I returned from my Welch journey. I was ſorry to leave my book ſuſpended ſo long; but having an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſo much convenience, a new part of the iſland, I could not reject it. I have been in five of the ſix counties of North Wales; and have ſeen St. Aſaph and Bangor, the two ſeats of their biſhops; have been upon Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manmaur and Snowden, and paſſed over into Angleſea. But Wales is ſo little different from England, that it offers nothing to the ſpeculation of the traveller.</p>
                     <p>When I came home, I found ſeveral of your papers, with ſome pages of Lord Hailes's Annals, which I will conſider. I am in haſte to give you ſome account of myſelf, leſt you ſhould ſuſpect me of negligence in the preſſing buſineſs which I find recommended to my care <note n="4" place="bottom">I had written to him, to requeſt his interpoſition in behalf of a convict, who I thought was very unjuſtly condemned.</note>, and which I knew nothing of till now, when all care is vain.</p>
                     <p>In the diſtribution of my books I purpoſe to follow your advice, adding ſuch as ſhall occur to me. I am not pleaſed with your notes of remembrance added to your names, for I hope I ſhall not eaſily forget them.</p>
                     <p>I have received four Erſe books, without any direction, and ſuſpect that they are intended for the Oxford library. If that is the intention, I think it will be proper to add the metrical pſalms, and whatever elſe is printed in Erſe, that the preſent may be complete. The donor's name ſhould be told.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh you could have read the book before it was printed, but our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance does not eaſily permit it.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry Lord Hailes does not intend to publiſh Walton; I am afraid it will not be done ſo well, if it be done at all.</p>
                     <p>I purpoſe now to drive the book forward. Make my compliments to Mrs. Boſwell, and let me hear often from you.</p>

 This tour to Wales, which was made in company with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, though it no doubt contributed to his health and amuſement, did not give occaſion to ſuch a diſcurſive exerciſe of his mind as our tour to the Hebrides. I do not find that he kept any journal or notes of what he ſaw there. All that I heard him ſay of it was, that inſtead of bleak and barren mountains, there were green and fertile ones; and that one of the caſtles in Wales would contain all the caſtles that he had ſeen in Scotland.</p>
               <p>Parliament having been diſſolved, and his friend Mr. Thrale, who was a ſteady ſupporter of government, having again to encounter the ſtorm of a conteſted election, he wrote a ſhort political pamphlet, entitled <q rend="inline">"The Patriot, *"</q> addreſſed to the electors of Great-Britain; a title which, to factious men, who conſider a patriot only as an oppoſer of the meaſures of government, will appear ſtrangely miſapplied. It was, however, written with energetick viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and, except thoſe paſſages in which it endeavours to vindicate the glaring outrage of the Houſe of Commons in the caſe of the Middleſex election, and to juſtify the attempt to reduce our fellow-ſubjects in America to uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſubmiſſion, it contained an admirable diſplay of the properties of a real patriot, in the original and genuine ſenſe,—a ſincere, ſteady, rational, and unbiaſſed friend to the intereſts and proſperity of his King and country. It muſt be acknowledged, however, that both in this and his two former pamphlets, there was, amidſt many powerful arguments, not only a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able portion of ſophiſtry, but a contemptuous ridicule of his opponents, which was very provoking.</p>

                     <p>LAST night I corrected the laſt page of our 'Journey to the Hebrides.' The printer has detained it all this time, for I had, before I went into Wales, written all except two ſheets. 'The Patriot' was called for by my political friends on Friday, was written on Saturday, and I have heard little of it. So vague are conjectures at a diſtance <note n="6" place="bottom">Alluding to a paſſage in a letter of mine, where ſpeaking of his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Hebrides,"</q> I ſay, <q rend="inline">"But has not 'The Patriot' been an interruption, by the time taken to write it, and the time luxuriouſly ſpent in liſtening to its applauſes?"</q>
                        </note>. As ſoon as I can, I will take care that copies be ſent to you, for I would wiſh that they might be given before they are bought; but I am afraid that Mr. Strahan will ſend to you and to the bookſellers at the ſame time. Trade is as diligent as courteſy. I have mentioned all that you recommended. Pray make my compliments to Mrs. Boſwell and the younglings. The club has, I think, not yet met.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, and tell me honeſtly, what you think and others ſay of our travels. Shall we touch the continent <note n="7" place="bottom">We had projected a voyage together up the Baltick, and talked of viſiting ſome of the more northern regions.</note>?</p>

               <p>In his manuſcript diary of this year, there is the following entry:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Nov. 27. Advent Sunday. I conſidered that this day, being the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the eccleſiaſtical year, was a proper time for a new courſe of life. I began to read the Greek Teſtament regularly at 160 verſes every Sunday. This day I began the Acts.</p>
                  <p>In this week I read Virgil's Paſtorals. I learned to repeat the Pollio and Gallus. I read careleſsly the firſt Georgick.</p>

                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:0548300101:473"/>
 Such evidences of his unceaſing ardour, both for <q rend="inline">"divine and human lore,"</q> when advanced into his ſixty-fourth year, and notwithſtanding his many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances from diſeaſe, muſt make us at once honour his ſpirit, and lament that it ſhould be ſo grievouſly clogged by its material tegument. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that he was very fond of the preciſion which calculation produces. Thus we find in one of his manuſcript diaries, <q rend="inline">"12 pages in 4to Gr. Teſt. and 30 pages in Beza's folio, comprize the whole in 40 days."</q>

                     <p>BE pleaſed to accept of my beſt thanks for your 'Journey to the Hebrides,' which came to me by laſt night's poſt. I did really aſk the favour twice; but you have been even with me, by granting it ſo ſpeedily. BIS <hi>dat qui cito dat.</hi> Though ill of a bad cold, you kept me up the greateſt part of the laſt night; for I did not ſtop till I had read every word of your book. I looked back to our firſt talking of a viſit to the Hebrides, which was many years ago, when ſitting by ourſelves in the Mitre tavern, in London, I think about <hi>witching time o'night;</hi> and then exulted in contemplating our ſcheme fulfilled, and a <hi>monumentum perenne</hi> of it erected by your ſuperiour abilities. I ſhall only ſay, that your book has afforded me a high gratification. I ſhall afterwards give you my thoughts on particular paſſages. In the mean time, I haſten to tell you of your having miſtaken two names, which you will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in London, as I ſhall do here, that the gentlemen who deſerve the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able compliments which you have paid them, may enjoy their honours. In page 106, for <hi>Gordon</hi> read <hi>Murchiſon;</hi> and in page 357, for <hi>Maclean</hi> read <hi>Macleod.</hi>

                     <p>* * * * * *</p>
                     <p>But I am now to apply to you for immediate aid in my profeſſion, which you have never refuſed to grant when I requeſted it. I encloſe you a petition for Dr. Memis, a phyſician at Aberdeen, in which Sir John Dalrymple has exerted his talents, and which I am to anſwer as Counſel for the managers of the Royal Infirmary in that city. Mr. Jopp, the Provoſt, who delivered to you your freedom, is one of my clients, and, <hi>as a citizen of Aberdeen,</hi> you will ſupport him.</p>
                     <p>The fact is ſhortly this. In a tranſlation of the charter of the Infirmary from Latin into Engliſh, made under the authority of the managers, the ſame phraſe in the original is in one place rendered <hi>Phyſician,</hi> but when applied to Dr. Memis is rendered <hi>Doctor of Medicine.</hi> Dr. Memis complained of this
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0548300101:475" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 before the tranſlation was printed, but was not indulged with having it altered, and he has brought an action for damages, on account of a ſuppoſed injury, as if the deſignation given to him were an inferiour one, tending to make it be ſuppoſed he is <hi>not</hi> a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and, conſequently to hurt his practice. My father has diſmiſſed the action as groundleſs, and now he has appealed to the whole Court <note n="9" place="bottom">In the Court of Seſſion of Scotland an action is firſt tried by one of the Judges, who is called the Lord Ordinary; and if either party is diſſatisfied, he may appeal to the whole Court, conſiſting of fifteen, the Lord Preſident and fourteen other Judges, who have both in and out of Court the title of Lords, from the name of their eſtates; as, Lord Auchinleck, Lord Monboddo, &amp;c.</note>.</p>

                     <p>Pray let me know what I owed you when I left you, that I may ſend it to you.</p>
                     <p>I am going to write about the Americans. If you have picked up any hints among your lawyers, who are great maſters of the law of nations, or if your own mind ſuggeſts any thing, let me know. But mum,—it is a ſecret.</p>
                     <p>I will ſend your parcel of books as ſoon as I can; but I cannot do as I wiſh. However, you find every thing mentioned in the book which you recommended.</p>

                     <p>Poor Beauclerk is ſo ill, that his life is thought to be in danger. Lady Di. nurſes him with very great aſſiduity.</p>

If he aſks you to tranſcribe them for him, you may do it, but I think he muſt promiſe not to let them be copied again, nor to ſhow them as mine.</p>

However, I am aſhamed of my delay; and if I have the honour of receiving any more, promiſe punctually to return them by the next poſt.

I will be much obliged to you, if you will direct me where I ſhall find the beſt information of what is to be ſaid on both ſides. It is a ſubject vaſt in its preſent extent and future conſequences. The imperfect hints which now float in my mind, tend rather to the formation of an opinion that our government has been precipitant and ſevere in the reſolutions taken againſt the Boſtonians. Well do you know that I have no kindneſs for that race. But nations, or bodies of men, ſhould, as well as individuals, have a fair trial, and not be condemned on character alone. Have we not expreſs contracts with our colonies, which afford a more certain foundation of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than general political ſpeculations on the mutual rights of ſtates and their provinces or colonies? Pray let me know immediately what to read,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0548300101:477"/>
 and I ſhall diligently endeavour to gather for you any thing that I can find. Is Burke's ſpeech on American Taxation publiſhed by himſelf? Is it authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick? I remember to have heard you ſay, that you had never conſidered Eaſt Indian affairs; though, ſurely, they are of much importance to Great-Britain. Under the recollection of this, I ſhelter myſelf from the reproach of ignorance about the Americans. If you write upon the ſubject, I ſhall certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. But, ſince you ſeem to expect that I ſhould know ſomething of it, without your inſtruction, and that my own mind ſhould ſuggeſt ſomething, I truſt you will put me in the way.</p>

                     <p>AS to Macpherſon, I am anxious to have from yourſelf a full and pointed account of what has paſſed between you and him. It is confidently told here, that before your book came out he ſent to you, to let you know that he underſtood you meant to deny the authenticity of Oſſian's Poems; that the originals were in his poſſeſſion; that you might have inſpection of them, and might take the evidence of people ſkilled in the Erſe language; and that he hoped, after this fair offer, you would not be ſo uncandid as to aſſert that he had refuſed reaſonable proof. That you paid no regard to his meſſage, but publiſhed your ſtrong attack upon him; that then he wrote a letter to you, in
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0548300101:478"/>
ſuch terms as he thought ſuited to one who had not acted as a man of vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. You may believe it gives me pain to hear your conduct repreſented as unfavourable, while I can only deny what is ſaid, on the ground that your character refutes it, without having any information to oppoſe. Let me, I beg it of you, be furniſhed with a ſufficient anſwer to any calumny upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Lord Hailes writes to me, (for we correſpond more than we talk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) <q rend="inline">'As to Fingal, I ſee a controverſy ariſing, and purpoſe to keep out of its way.

 any reports that circulate among them. Macpherſon never in his life offered me the ſight of any original or of any evidence of any kind, but thought only of intimidating me by noiſe and threats, till my laſt anſwer,—that I would not be deterred from detecting what I thought a cheat, by the menaces of a ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian,—put an end to our correſpondence.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of the queſtion is this. He, and Dr. Blair, whom I conſider as deceived, ſay, that he copied the poem from old manuſcripts. His copies, if he had them, and I believe him to have none, are nothing. Where are the manuſcripts? They can be ſhown if they exiſt, but they were never ſhown. <hi>De non exiſtentibus et non apparentibus,</hi> ſays our law, <hi>eadem eſt ratio.</hi> No man has a claim to credit upon his own word, when better evidence, if he had it, may be eaſily produced. But, ſo far as we can find, the Erſe language was never written till very lately for the purpoſes of religion. A nation that cannot write, or a language that was never written, has no manuſcripts.</p>
                     <p>But whatever he has, he never offered to ſhow. If old manuſcripts ſhould now be mentioned, I ſhould, unleſs there were more evidence than can be eaſily had, ſuppoſe them another proof of Scotch conſpiracy in national falſehood.</p>
                     <p>Do not cenſure the expreſſion; you know it to be true.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Memis's queſtion is ſo narrow as to allow no ſpeculation; and I have no facts before me but thoſe which his advocate has produced againſt you.</p>
                     <p>I conſulted this morning the Preſident of the London College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who ſays, that with us, <hi>Doctor of Phyſick</hi> (we do not ſay <hi>Doctor of Medicine)</hi> is the higheſt title that a practicer of phyſick can have; that <hi>Doctor</hi> implies not only <hi>Phyſician,</hi> but teacher of phyſick; that every <hi>Doctor</hi> is legally a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> but no man, not a <hi>Doctor,</hi> can <hi>practice phyſick</hi> but by <hi>licence</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly granted.

               <p>Mr. Macpherſon little knew the character of Dr. Johnſon, if he ſuppoſed that he could be eaſily intimidated; for no man was ever more remarkable for perſonal courage. He had, indeed, an aweful dread of death, or rather <q rend="inline">"of ſomething after death;"</q> and what rational man, who ſeriouſly thinks of quitting all that he has ever known, and going into a new and unknown ſtate of being, can be without that dread? But his fear was from reflection, his courage natural. His fear, in that one inſtance, was the reſult of philoſophical and religious conſideration. He feared death, but he feared nothing elſe, not even what might occaſion death. Many inſtances of his reſolution may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. One day, at Mr. Beauclerk's houſe in the country, when two large dogs were fighting, he went up to them, and beat them till they ſeparated; and at another time, when told of the danger there was that a gun might burſt if charged with many balls, he put in ſix or ſeven, and fired it off againſt a wall. Mr. Langton told me, that when they were ſwimming together near Oxford, he cautioned Dr. Johnſon againſt a pool, which was reckoned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly dangerous; upon which Johnſon directly ſwam into it. He told me himſelf that one night he was attacked in the ſtreet by four men, to whom he would not yield, but kept them all at bay, till the watch came up, and carried both him and them to the round-houſe. In the play-houſe at Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, as Mr. Garrick informed me, Johnſon having for a moment quitted a chair which was placed for him between the ſide-ſcenes, a gentleman took
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0548300101:481"/>
 poſſeſſion of it, and when Johnſon on his return civilly demanded his ſeat, rudely refuſed to give it up; upon which Johnſon laid hold of him, and toſſed him and the chair into the pit. Foote, who ſo ſucceſsfully revived the old comedy, by exhibiting living characters, had reſolved to imitate Johnſon on the ſtage, expecting great profits from his ridicule of ſo celebrated a man. Johnſon being informed of his intention, and being at dinner at Mr. Thomas Davies's the bookſeller, from whom I had the ſtory, he aſked Mr. Davies <q rend="inline">"what was the common price of an oak ſtick;"</q> and being anſwered ſix-pence, <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir, (ſaid he,) give me leave to ſend your ſervant to purchaſe me a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one. I'll have a double quantity; for I am told Foote means to <hi>take me off,</hi> as he calls it, and I am determined the fellow ſhall not do it with impunity."</q> Davies took care to acquaint Foote of this, which effectually checked the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of the mimick. Mr. Macpherſon's menaces made Johnſon provide himſelf with the ſame implement of defence; and had he been attacked, I have no doubt that, old as he was, he would have made his corporal proweſs be felt as much as his intellectual.</p>
               <p>His <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland, *"</q> is a moſt valuable performance. It abounds in extenſive philoſophical views of ſociety, and in ingenious ſentiments and lively deſcription. A conſiderable part of it, indeed, conſiſts of ſpeculations, which many years before he ſaw the wild regions which we viſited together, probably had employed his attention, though the actual ſight of thoſe ſcenes undoubtedly quickened and augmented them. Mr. Orme, the very able hiſtorian, agreed with me in this opinion, which he thus ſtrongly expreſſed:—"<q rend="inline">There are in that book thoughts, which, by long revolution in the great mind of Johnſon, have been formed and poliſhed like pebbles rolled in the ocean!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>That he was to ſome degree of exceſs a <hi>true-born Engliſhman,</hi> ſo as to have ever entertained an undue prejudice againſt both the country and the people of Scotland, muſt be allowed. But it was a prejudice of the head, and not of the heart. He had no ill will to the Scotch; for, if he had been conſcious of that, he would never have thrown himſelf into the boſom of their country, and truſted to the protection of its remote inhabitants with a fearleſs confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. His remark upon the nakedneſs of the country, from its being denuded of trees, was made after having travelled two hundred miles along the eaſtern coaſt, where certainly trees are not to be found near the road, and he ſaid it was <q rend="inline">"a map of the road"</q> which he gave. His diſbelief of the authenticity of the poems aſcribed to Oſſian, a Highland bard, was confirmed in the courſe of his journey, by a very ſtrict examination of the evidence offered for it; and although
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0548300101:482"/>
their authenticity was made too much a national point by the Scotch, there were many reſpectable perſons in that country who did not concur in this; ſo that his judgement upon the queſtion ought not to be decried, even by thoſe who differ from him. As to myſelf, I can only ſay, upon a ſubject now become very unintereſting, that when the fragments of Highland poetry firſt came out, I was much pleaſed with their wild peculiarity, and was one of thoſe who ſubſcribed to enable their editor, Mr. Macpherſon, then a young man, to make a ſearch in the Highlands and Hebrides for a long poem in the Erſe language, which was reported to be preſerved ſomewhere in thoſe regions. But when there came forth an Epick Poem in ſix books, with all the common circumſtances of former compoſitions of that nature; and when, upon an attentive examination of it, there was found a perpetual recurrence of the ſame images which appear in the fragments; and when no ancient manuſcript, to authenticate the work, was depoſited in any publick library, though that was inſiſted on as a reaſonable proof, <hi>who</hi> could forbear to doubt?</p>
               <p>Johnſon's grateful acknowledgements of kindneſſes received in the courſe of this tour, completely refute the brutal reflections which have been thrown out againſt him, as if he had made an ungrateful return; and his delicacy in ſparing in his book thoſe who we find from his letters to Mrs. Thrale, were juſt objects of cenſure, is much to be admired. His candour and amiable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is conſpicuous from his conduct, when informed by Mr. Macleod, of Raſay, that he had committed a miſtake, which gave that gentleman ſome uneaſineſs. He wrote him a courteous and kind letter, and inſerted in the newſpapers an advertiſement, correcting the miſtake <note n="6" place="bottom">See <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> 3d edit. p. 520.</note>.</p>
               <p>The obſervations of my friend Mr. Dempſter in a letter written to me, ſoon after he had read Dr. Johnſon's book, are ſo juſt and liberal, that they cannot be too often repeated:</p>
               <p>* * * * * *</p>
               <q>
                  <p>There is nothing in the book, from beginning to end, that a Scotchman need to take amiſs. What he ſays of the country is true; and his obſervations on the people are what muſt naturally occur to a ſenſible, obſerving, and reflecting inhabitant of a convenient metropolis, where a man on thirty pounds a year may be better accommodated with all the little wants of life, than Col or Sir Allan.</p>
                  <p>I am charmed with his reſearches concerning the Erſe language, and the antiquity of their manuſcripts. I am quite convinced; and I ſhall rank Oſſian,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0548300101:483"/>
 and his Fingals and Oſcars, amongſt the nurſery tales, not the true hiſtory of our country, in all time to come.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, the book cannot diſpleaſe, for it has no pretenſions. The authour neither ſays he is a geographer, nor an antiquarian, nor very learned in the hiſtory of Scotland, nor a naturaliſt, nor a foſſiliſt. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, and the face of the country, are all he attempts to deſcribe, or ſeems to have thought of. Much were it to be wiſhed, that they who have travelled into more remote, and of courſe more curious regions, had all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed his good ſenſe. Of the ſtate of learning, his obſervations on Glaſgow Univerſity ſhew he has formed a very ſound judgement. He underſtands our climate too; and he has accurately obſerved the changes, however ſlow and imperceptible to us, which Scotland has undergone, in conſequence of the bleſſings of liberty and internal peace.</p>
               </q>
               <p>* * * * * *</p>
               <p>Mr. Knox, another native of Scotland, who has ſince made the ſame tour, and publiſhed an account of it, is equally liberal. <q rend="inline">"I have read (ſays he,) his book again and again, travelled with him from Berwick to Glenelg, through countries with which I am well acquainted; ſailed with him from Glenelg to Raſay, Sky, Rum, Col, Mull, and Icolmkill, but have not been able to correct him in any matter of conſequence. I have often admired the accuracy, the preciſion, and the juſtneſs of what he advances, reſpecting both the country and the people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"The Doctor has every where delivered his ſentiments with freedom, and in many inſtances with a ſeeming regard for the benefit of the inhabitants, and the ornament of the country. His remarks on the want of trees and hedges for ſhade, as well as for ſhelter to the cattle, are well founded, and merit the thanks, not the illiberal cenſure of the natives. He alſo felt for the diſtreſſes of the Highlanders, and explodes, with great propriety, the bad management of the grounds, and the neglect of timber in the Hebrides."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having quoted Johnſon's juſt compliments on the Raſay family, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"On the other hand, I found this family equally laviſh in their encomiums upon the Doctor's converſation, and his ſubſequent civilities to a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that country, who, upon waiting upon him at London, was well received, and experienced all the attention and regard that a warm friend could beſtow. Mr. Macleod having alſo been in London, waited upon the Doctor, who provided a magnificent and expenſive entertainment, in honour of his old Hebridean acquaintance."</q>

And talking of the military road by Fort Auguſtus, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"By this road,  though one of the moſt rugged in Great-Britain, the celebrated Dr. Johnſon paſſed from Inverneſs to the Hebride Iſles. His obſervations on the country and people are extremely correct, judicious, and inſtructive <note n="7" place="bottom">Page 103.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His private letters to Mrs. Thrale, written during the courſe of his journey, which therefore may be ſuppoſed to convey his genuine feelings at the time, abound in ſuch benignant ſentiments towards the people who ſhewed him civilities, that no man whoſe temper is not very harſh and ſour, can retain a doubt of the goodneſs of his heart.</p>
               <p>It is painful to recollect with what rancour he was aſſailed by numbers of ſhallow irritable North-Britons, on account of his ſuppoſed injurious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their country and countrymen, in his <q rend="inline">"Journey."</q> Had there been any juſt ground for ſuch a charge, would the virtuous and candid Dempſter have given his opinion of the book, in the terms which I have quoted? Would the patriotick Knox<note n="8" place="bottom">I obſerve with much regret, while this work is paſſing through the preſs, (Auguſt, 1790,) that this ingenious gentleman is dead.</note> have ſpoken of it as he has done? And let me add, that, citizen of the world as I hold myſelf to be, I have that degree of predilection for my <hi>natale ſolum,</hi> nay, I have that juſt ſenſe of the merit of an ancient nation, which has been ever renowned for its valour, which in former times maintained its independence againſt a powerful neighbour, and in modern times has been equally diſtinguiſhed for its ingenuity and induſtry in civiliſed life, that I ſhould have felt a generous indignation at any injuſtice done to it. Johnſon treated Scotland no worſe than he did even his beſt friends, whoſe characters he uſed to give as they appeared to him, both in light and ſhade. Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had not exerciſed their minds ſufficiently, condemned him for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring his friends. But Sir Joſhua Reynolds, whoſe philoſophical penetration and juſtneſs of thinking are not leſs known to thoſe who live with him, than his genius in his art is admired by the world, explained his conduct thus: <q rend="inline">"He was fond of diſcrimination, which he could not ſhew without pointing out the bad as well as the good in every character; and as his friends were thoſe whoſe characters he knew beſt, they afforded him the beſt opportunity for ſhewing the acuteneſs of his judgement."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He expreſſed to his friend Mr. Windham of Norfolk, his wonder at the extreme jealouſy of the Scotch, and their reſentment at having their country deſcribed by him as it really was; when, to ſay that it was a country as good
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0548300101:485" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 as England, would have been a groſs falſehood. <q rend="inline">"None of us, (ſaid he,) would be offended if a foreigner who has travelled here ſhould ſay, that vines and olives don't grow in England."</q> And as to his prejudice againſt the Scotch, which I always aſcribed to that nationality which he obſerved in <hi>them,</hi> he ſaid to the ſame gentleman, <q rend="inline">"When I find a Scotchman to whom an Engliſhman is as a Scotchman, that Scotchman ſhall be as an Engliſhman to me."</q> His intimacy with many gentlemen of Scotland, and his employing ſo many natives of that country as his amanuenſes, prove that his prejudice was not virulent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I have depoſited in the Britiſh Muſeum, amongſt other pieces of his writing, the following note, in anſwer to one from me, aſking if he would meet me at dinner at the Mitre, though a friend of mine, a Scotchman, was to be there:—<q rend="inline">"Mr. Johnſon does not ſee why Mr. Boſwell ſhould ſuppoſe a Scotchman leſs acceptable than any other man. He will be at the Mitre."</q>
               </p>
               <p>My much-valued friend Dr. Barnard, now Biſhop of Killaloe, having once expreſſed to him an apprehenſion, that if he ſhould viſit Ireland he might treat the people of that country more unfavourably than he had done the Scotch, he anſwered, with ſtrong pointed double-edged wit, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have no reaſon to be afraid of me. The Iriſh are not in a conſpiracy to cheat the world by falſe repreſentations of the merits of their countrymen. No, Sir; the Iriſh are a FAIR PEOPLE:—they never ſpeak well of one another."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon told me an inſtance of Scottiſh nationality, which made a very unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable impreſſion upon his mind. A Scotchman, of ſome conſideration in London, ſolicited him to recommend, by the weight of his learned authority, to be maſter of an Engliſh ſchool, a perſon of whom he who recommended him confeſſed he knew no more but that he was his countryman. Johnſon was ſhocked at this unconſcientious conduct.</p>
               <p>All the miſerable cavillings againſt his <q rend="inline">"Journey,"</q> in newſpapers, maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, and other fugitive publications, I can ſpeak from certain knowledge, only furniſhed him with ſport. At laſt there came out a ſcurrilous volume, larger than Johnſon's own, filled with malignant abuſe, under a name, real or fictitious, of ſome low man in an obſcure corner of Scotland, though ſuppoſed to be the work of another Scotchman, who has found means to make himſelf well known both in Scotland and England. The effect which it had upon Johnſon was, to produce this pleaſant obſervation to Mr. Seward, to whom he lent the book: <q rend="inline">"This fellow muſt be a blockhead. They don't know how to go about their abuſe. Who will read a five ſhilling book againſt me? No, Sir, if they had wit, they ſhould have kept pelting me with pamphlets."</q>

                     <p>YOU would have been very well pleaſed if you had dined with me to day. I had for my gueſts, Macquharrie, young Maclean of Col, the ſucceſſor of our friend, a very amiable man, though not marked with ſuch active qualities as his brother, Mr. Maclean of Torloiſk in Mull a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Sir Allan's family, and two of the clan Grant, ſo that the Highland and Hebridean genius reigned. We had a great deal of converſation about you, and drank your health in a bumper. The toaſt was not propoſed by me, which is a circumſtance to be remarked, for I am now ſo connected with you, that any thing that I can ſay or do to your honour has not the value of an additional compliment. It is only giving you a guinea out of that treaſure of admiration which already belongs to you, and which is no hidden treaſure; for I ſuppoſe my admiration of you is co-exiſtent with the knowledge of my character.</p>
                     <p>I find that the Highlanders and Hebrideans in general are much fonder of your 'Journey,' than the low-country or <hi>hither</hi> Scots. One of the Grants ſaid to day, that he was ſure you were a man of a good heart, and a candid man, and ſeemed to hope he ſhould be able to convince you of the antiquity of a good proportion of the poems of Oſſian. After all that has paſſed, I think the matter is capable of being proved to a certain degree. I am told that Macpherſon got one old Erſe MS. from Clanranald, for the reſtitution of which he executed a formal obligation; and it is affirmed, that the Gaelick (call it Erſe or call it Iriſh,) has been written in the Highlands and Hebrides for many centuries. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that ſuch of the inhabitants as acquired any learning, poſſeſſed the art of writing as well as their Iriſh neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Celtick couſins; and the queſtion is, can ſufficient evidence be ſhewn of this?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are ſkilled in ancient writings can determine the age of MSS. or at leaſt can aſcertain the century in which they were written; and if men of veracity, who are ſo ſkilled, ſhall tell us that MSS. in the poſſeſſion of families in the Highlands and iſles, are the works of a remote age, I think we ſhould be convinced by their teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>There is now come to this city, Ranald Macdonald, from the Iſle of Egg, who has ſeveral MSS. of Erſe poetry, which he wiſhes to publiſh by ſubſcription. I have engaged to take three copies of the book, the price of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0548300101:487"/>
 which is to be ſix ſhillings, as I would ſubſcribe for all the Erſe that can be printed, be it old or new, that the language may be preſerved. This man ſays, that ſome of his manuſcripts are ancient; and, to be ſure, one of them which was ſhewn to me does appear to have the duſkyneſs of antiquity.</p>
                     <p>* * * * * *</p>
                     <p>The inquiry is not yet quite hopeleſs, and I ſhould think that the exact truth may be diſcovered, if proper means be uſed.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I AM ſorry that I could get no books for my friends in Scotland. Mr. Strahan has at laſt promiſed to ſend two dozen to you. If they come, put the names of my friends into them; you may cut them out <note n="9" place="bottom">From a liſt in his hand-writing.</note>, and paſte them with a little ſtarch in the book.</p>
                     <p>You then are going wild about Oſſian. Why do you think any part can be proved? The duſky manuſcript of Egg is probably not fifty years old; if it be an hundred, it proves nothing. The tale of Clanranald has no proof. Has Clanranald told it? Can he prove it? There are, I believe, no Erſe manuſcripts. None of the old families had a ſingle letter in Erſe that we heard of. You ſay it is likely that they could write. The learned, if any learned there were, could; but knowing by that learning ſome written lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in that language they wrote, as letters had never been applied to their own. If there are manuſcripts, let them be ſhewn, with ſome proof that they are not forged for the occaſion. You ſay many can remember parts of Oſſian. I believe all thoſe parts are verſions of the Engliſh, at leaſt there is no proof of their antiquity.</p>
                     <p>Macpherſon is ſaid to have made ſome tranſlations himſelf; and having taught a boy to write it, ordered him to ſay that he had learned it of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother. The boy, when he grew up, told the ſtory. This Mrs. Williams heard at Mr. Strahan's table. Do not be credulous; you know how little a Highlander can be truſted. Macpherſon is, ſo far as I know, very quiet. Is not that proof enough? Every thing is againſt him. No viſible manuſcript; no inſcription in the language: no correſpondence among friends: no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of buſineſs, of which a ſingle ſcrap remains in the ancient families. Macpherſon's pretence is, that the character was Saxon. If he had not talked
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0548300101:488" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unſkilfully of <hi>manuſcripts,</hi> he might have fought with oral tradition much longer. As to Mr. Grant's information, I ſuppoſe he knows much leſs of the matter than ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the bookſeller ſays that the ſale<note n="1" place="bottom">Of his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland."</q>
                        </note> is ſufficiently quick. They printed four thouſand. Correct your copy wherever it is wrong, and bring it up. Your friends will all be glad to ſee you. I think of going my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the country about May.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry that I have not managed to ſend the books ſooner. I have left four for you, and do not reſtrict you abſolutely to follow my directions in the diſtribution. You muſt uſe your own diſcretion.</p>

               <p>On Tueſday, March 21, I arrived in London; and on repairing to Dr. Johnſon's before dinner, found him in his ſtudy, ſitting with Mr. Peter Garrick, the elder brother of David, ſtrongly reſembling him in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and voice, but of more ſedate and placid manners. Johnſon informed me, that <q rend="inline">"though Mr. Beauclerk was in great pain, it was hoped he was not in danger, and that he now wiſhed to conſult Dr. Heberden to try the effect of a <hi>new underſtanding."</hi>
                  </q> Both at this interview, and in the evening at Mr. Thrale's, where he and Mr. Peter Garrick and I met again, he was vehement on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Oſſian controverſy; obſerving, <q rend="inline">"We do not know that there are any ancient Erſe manuſcripts; and we have no other reaſon to diſbelieve that there are men with three heads, but that we do not know that there are any ſuch men."</q> He alſo was outrageous, upon his ſuppoſition that my countrymen <q rend="inline">"loved Scotland better than truth,"</q> ſaying, <q rend="inline">"All of them,—nay not all,—but <hi>droves</hi> of them, would come up, and atteſt any thing for the honour of Scotland."</q> He alſo perſevered in his wild allegation, that he queſtioned if there was a tree between Edinburgh and the Engliſh border older than himſelf. I aſſured him he was miſtaken, and ſuggeſted that the proper puniſhment would be that he ſhould receive a ſtripe at every tree above a hundred years old, that was found within that ſpace. He laughed, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I believe I might ſubmit to it for a <hi>bawbie!"</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:0548300101:489" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 The doubts which, in my correſpondence with him, I had ventured to ſtate as to the juſtice and wiſdom of the conduct of Great-Britain towards the American colonies, while I at the ſame time requeſted that he would enable me to inform myſelf upon that momentous ſubject, he had altogether diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; and had recently publiſhed a pamphlet, entitled, <q rend="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny; an Anſwer to the Reſolutions and Addreſs of the American Congreſs. *"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had long before indulged moſt unfavourable ſentiments of our fellow ſubjects in America: For, as early as 1769, I was told by Dr. John Campbell, that he had ſaid of them, <q rend="inline">"Sir, they are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for any thing we allow them ſhort of hanging."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of this performance I avoided to talk with him; for I had now formed a clear and ſettled opinion, that the people of America were well warranted to reſiſt a claim that their fellow-ſubjects in the mother-country ſhould have the entire command of their fortunes, by taxing them without their own conſent; and the extreme violence which it breathed, appeared to me ſo unſuitable to the mildneſs of a Chriſtian philoſopher, and ſo directly oppoſite to the principles of peace which he had ſo beautifully recommended in his pamphlet reſpecting Falkland's Iſlands, that I was ſorry to ſee him appear in ſo unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a light. Beſides; I could not perceive in it that ability of argument, or that felicity of expreſſion, for which he was, upon other occaſions, ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Poſitive aſſertion, ſarcaſtical ſeverity, and extravagant ridicule, which he himſelf reprobated as a teſt of truth, were united in this rhapſody.</p>
               <p>That this pamphlet was written at the deſire of thoſe who were then in power, I have no doubt; and, indeed, he owned to me, that it had been reviſed and curtailed by ſome of them. He told me, that they had ſtruck out one paſſage, which was to this effect: <q rend="inline">"That the Coloniſts could with no ſolidity argue from their not having been taxed while in their infancy, that they ſhould not now be taxed. We do not put a calf into the plow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we wait till he is an ox."</q> He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They ſtruck it out either critically, as too ludicrous, or politically, as too exaſperating. I care not which. It was their buſineſs. If an architect ſays, I will build five ſtories, and the man who employs him ſays, I will have only three, the employer is to decide."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, (ſaid I,) in ordinary caſes. But ſhould it be ſo when the archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect gives his ſkill and labour <hi>gratis?"</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Unfavourable as I am conſtrained to ſay my opinion of this pamphlet was, yet, ſince it was congenial with the ſentiments of numbers at that time, and as every thing relating to the writings of Dr. Johnſon is of importance in
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0548300101:490"/>
literary hiſtory, I ſhall therefore inſert ſome paſſages which were ſtruck out, it does not appear why, either by himſelf or thoſe who reviſed it. They appear printed in a few proof leaves of it in my poſſeſſion, marked with corrections in his own hand-writing. I ſhall diſtinguiſh them by <hi>Italicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the paragraph where he ſays, the Americans were incited to reſiſtance by European intelligence from <q rend="inline">"men whom they thought their friends, but who were friends only to themſelves,"</q> there followed,—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"and made, by their ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the enemies of their country."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And the next paragraph ran thus: <q rend="inline">"On the original contrivers of miſchief, <hi>rather than on thoſe whom they have deluded,</hi> let an inſulted nation pour out its vengeance."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The paragraph which came next was in theſe words:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Unhappy is that country, in which men can hope for advancement by favouring its enemies. The tranquillity of ſtable government is not always eaſily preſerved againſt the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſingle innovators; but what can be the hope of quiet, when factions hoſtile to the legiſlature can be openly formed and openly avowed?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the paragraph which now concludes the pamphlet, there followed this, in which he certainly means the great Earl of Chatham, and glances at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain popular Lord Chancellor:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"If, by the fortune of war, they drive us utterly away, what they will do next can only be conjectured. If a new monarchy is erected, they will want a <hi>KING.</hi> He who firſt takes into his hand the ſceptre of America, ſhould have a name of good omen. <hi>WILLIAM</hi> has been known both as conqueror and deliverer; and perhaps England, however contemned, might yet ſupply them with <hi>ANOTHER WILLIAM.</hi> Whigs, indeed, are not willing to be governed; and it is poſſible that <hi>KING WILLIAM</hi> may be ſtrongly inclined to guide their meaſures: but Whigs have been cheated like other mortals, and ſuffered their leader to become their tyrant, under the name of their <hi>PROTECTOR.</hi> What more they will receive from England, no man can tell. In their rudiments of empire they may want a <hi>CHANCELLOR."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then came this paragraph:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Their numbers are, at preſent, not quite ſufficient for the greatneſs which, in ſome form of government or other, is to rival the ancient monarchies; but, by Dr. Franklin's rule of progreſſion, they will, in a century and a quarter, be more than equal to the inhabitants of Europe. When the Whigs of America are thus multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, let the Princes of the earth tremble in their palaces. If they ſhould continue to double and to double, their own hemiſphere will not contain them. But let not our boldeſt oppugners of authority look forward with delight to this futurity of Whiggiſm."</q>

 How it ended I know not, as it is cut off abruptly at the foot of the laſt of theſe proof pages.</p>
               <p>His pamphlets in ſupport of the meaſures of adminiſtration were publiſhed on his own account, and he afterwards collected them into a volume, with the title of <q rend="inline">"Political Tracts, by the Authour of the Rambler,"</q> with this motto,</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Fallitur egregio quiſquis ſub Principe credit</l>

                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe pamphlets drew upon him numerous attacks. Againſt the common weapons of literary warfare he was hardened; but there were two inſtances of animadverſion which I communicated to him, and from what I could judge, both from his ſilence and his looks, appeared to me to impreſs him much.</p>
               <p>One was, a <q rend="inline">"A Letter to Dr. Samuel Johnſon, occaſioned by his late political Publications."</q> It appeared previous to his <q rend="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny,"</q> and was written by Dr. Joſeph Towers. In that performance, Dr. Johnſon was treated with the reſpect due to ſo eminent a man, while his conduct as a political writer was boldly and pointedly arraigned, as inconſiſtent with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one, who, if he did employ his pen upon politicks, <q rend="inline">"it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected ſhould diſtinguiſh himſelf, not by party violence and rancour, but by moderation and by wiſdom."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It concluded thus: <q rend="inline">"I would, however, wiſh you to remember, ſhould you again addreſs the publick under the character of a political writer, that luxuriance of imagination or energy of language will ill compenſate for the want of candour, of juſtice, and of truth. And I ſhall only add, that ſhould I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be diſpoſed to read, as I heretofore have done, the moſt excellent of all your performances, 'THE RAMBLER,' the pleaſure which I have been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to find in it will be much diminiſhed by the reflection that the writer of ſo moral, ſo elegant, and ſo valuable a work, was capable of proſtituting his talents in ſuch productions as 'The Falſe Alarm,' the 'Thoughts on the Tranſactions reſpecting Falkland's Iſlands,' and 'The Patriot."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am willing to do juſtice to the merit of Dr. Towers, of whom I will ſay, that although I abhor his Whiggiſh democratical notions and propenſities, (for I will not call them principles,) I eſteem him as an ingenious, knowing, and very convivial man.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance was a paragraph of a letter to me, from my old and moſt intimate friend the Reverend Mr. Temple, who wrote the character of

Gray, which has had the honour to be adopted both by Mr. Maſon and Dr. Johnſon in their accounts of that poet. The words were, <q rend="inline">"How can your great, I will not ſay your <hi>pious,</hi> but your <hi>moral</hi> friend, ſupport the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous meaſures of adminiſtration, which they have not the face to aſk even their infidel penſioner Hume to defend."</q>
               </p>
               <p>However confident of the rectitude of his own mind, Johnſon may have felt ſincere uneaſineſs that his conduct ſhould be erroneouſly imputed to unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy motives, by good men, and that the influence of his valuable writings ſhould on that account be in any degree obſtructed or leſſened.</p>
               <p>He complained to a Right Honourable friend of diſtinguiſhed talents and very elegant manners, with whom he maintained a long intimacy, and whoſe generoſity towards him will afterwards appear, that his penſion having been given to him as a literary character, he had been applied to by adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to write political pamphlets; and he was even ſo much irritated, that he delared his reſolution to reſign his penſion. His friend ſhewed him the impropriety of ſuch a meaſure, and he afterwards expreſſed his gratitude, and ſaid he had received good advice. To that friend he once ſignified a wiſh to have his penſion ſecured to him for his life; but he neither aſked nor received from government any reward whatſoever for his political labours.</p>
               <p>On Friday, March 24, I met him at the LITERARY CLUB, where were Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Mr. Colman, Dr. Percy, Mr. Veſey, Sir Charles Bunbury, Dr. George Fordyce, Mr. Steevens, and Mr. Charles Fox. Before he came in, we talked of his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands,"</q> and of his coming away, <q rend="inline">"willing to believe the ſecond ſight <note n="2" place="bottom">Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland,"</q> edit. 1785, p. 256.</note>,"</q> which ſeemed to excite ſome ridicule. I was then ſo impreſſed with the truth of many of the ſtories of it which I had been told, that I avowed my conviction, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"He is only <hi>willing</hi> to believe, I <hi>do</hi> believe. The evidence is enough for me, though not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Are you? (ſaid Colman,) then cork it up."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I found his <q rend="inline">"Journey"</q> the common topick of converſation in London at this time, wherever I happened to be. At one of Lord Mansfield's formal Sunday evening converſations, ſtrangely called <hi>Levées,</hi> his Lordſhip addreſſed me, <q rend="inline">"We have all been reading your travels, Mr. Boſwell."</q> I anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I was but the humble attendant of Dr. Johnſon."</q> The Chief Juſtice replied, with that air and manner which none, who ever ſaw and heard him, can forget, <q rend="inline">"He ſpeaks ill of nobody but Oſſian."</q>

 Johnſon was in high ſpirits this evening at the club, and talked with great animation and ſucceſs. He attacked Swift, as he uſed to do upon all occaſions. <q rend="inline">"The Tale of a Tub' is ſo much ſuperiour to his other writings, that one can hardly believe he was the authour of it. There is in it ſuch a vigour of mind, ſuch a ſwarm of thoughts, ſo much of nature, and art, and life."</q> I wondered to hear him ſay of <q rend="inline">"Gulliver's Travels,"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"When once you have thought of big men and little men, it is very eaſy to do all the reſt."</q> I endeavoured to make a ſtand for Swift, and tried to rouſe thoſe who were much more able to defend him; but in vain. Johnſon at laſt of his own accord allowed very great merit to the inventory of articles found in the pockets of the Man Mountain, particularly the deſcription of his watch, which it was conjectured was his GOD, as he conſulted it upon all occaſions. He obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"Swift put his name to but two things, (after he had a name to put,) 'The Plan for the Improvement of the Engliſh Language,' and the laſt 'Drapier's Letter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>From Swift, there was an eaſy tranſition to Mr. Thomas Sheridan.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sheridan is a wonderful admirer of the tragedy of Douglas, and preſented its authour with a gold medal. Some years ago, at a coffee-houſe in Oxford, I called to him, 'Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Sheridan, how came you to give a gold medal to Home, for writing that fooliſh play?' This, you ſee, was wanton and inſolent; but I <hi>meant</hi> to be wanton and inſolent. A medal has no value but as a ſtamp of merit. And was Sheridan to aſſume to himſelf the right of giving that ſtamp? If Sheridan was magnificent enough to beſtow a gold medal as an honorary reward of dramatick excellence, he ſhould have requeſted one of the Univerſities to chooſe the perſon on whom it ſhould be conferred. Sheridan had no right to give a ſtamp of merit: it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting Apollo's coin."</q>

               <p>On Monday, March 27, I breakfaſted with him at Mr. Strahan's. He told us, that he was engaged to go that evening to Mrs. Abington's benefit. <q rend="inline">"She was viſiting ſome ladies whom I was viſiting, and begged that I would come to her benefit. I told her I could not heat: but ſhe inſiſted ſo much on my coming, that it would have been brutal to have refuſed her."</q> This was a ſpeech quite characteriſtical. He loved to bring forward his having been in the gay circles of life; and he was, perhaps, a little vain of the ſolicitations of this elegant and faſhionable actreſs. He told us, the play was to be <q rend="inline">"The Hypocrite,"</q> altered from Cibber's <q rend="inline">"Nonjuror,"</q> ſo as to ſatyrize the Methodiſts. <q rend="inline">"I do not think (ſaid he,) the character of the Hypocrite juſtly applicable to the Methodiſts; but it was very applicable to the Nonjurors.

I once ſaid to Dr. Madan, a clergyman of Ireland, who was a great Whig, that perhaps a Nonjuror would have been leſs criminal in taking the oaths impoſed by the ruling power, than refuſing them; becauſe refuſing them, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily laid him under almoſt an irreſiſtible temptation to be more criminal; for, a man <hi>muſt</hi> live, and if he precludes himſelf from the ſupport furniſhed by the eſtabliſhment, will probably be reduced to very wicked ſhifts to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <p>This was not merely a curſory remark; for in his Life of Fenton he obſerves, <q rend="inline">"With many other wiſe and virtuous men, who at that time of diſcord and debate [about the beginning of this century,] conſulted conſcience well or ill informed, more than intereſt, he doubted the legality of the government; and refuſing to qualify himſelf for publick employment, by taking the oaths required, left the Univerſity without a degree."</q> This conduct, Johnſon calls <q rend="inline">"perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of integrity."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The queſtion concerning the morality of taking oaths, of whatever kind, impoſed by the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power at the time, rather than to be excluded from all conſequence, or even any conſiderable uſefulneſs in ſociety, has been agitated with all the acuteneſs of caſuiſtry. It is related, that he who deviſed the oath of abjuration, profligately boaſted, that he had framed a teſt which ſhould damn one half of the nation, and ſtarve the other. Upon minds not exalted to inflexible rectitude, or minds in which zeal for a party is predominant to exceſs, taking that oath againſt conviction, may have been palliated under the plea of neceſſity, or ventured upon in heat, as upon the whole producing more good than evil.</p>
                        <p>At a county election in Scotland, many years ago, when there was a warm conteſt between the friends of the Hanoverian ſucceſſion and thoſe againſt it, the oath of abjuration having been demanded, the freeholders upon one ſide roſe to go away. Upon which a very ſanguine gentleman, one of their number, ran to the door to ſtop them, calling out with much earneſtneſs, <q rend="inline">"Stay, ſtay, my friends, and let us ſwear the rogues out of it!"</q>
                        </p>
                     </note>."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould think, Sir, that a man who took the oaths contrary to his principles, was a determined wicked man, becauſe he was ſure he was committing perjury: whereas a Nonjuror might be inſenſibly led to do what was wrong, without being ſo directly conſcious of it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a man who goes to bed to his patron's wife is pretty ſure that he is committing wickedneſs."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Did the nonjuring clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do ſo, Sir?</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I am afraid many of them did."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was ſtartled at his argument, and could by no means think it convincing. Had not his own father complied with the requiſition of government, (as to which he once obſerved to me, when I preſſed him upon it, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"That,</hi> Sir, he was to ſettle with himſelf,"</q>) he would probably have thought more unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of a Jacobite who took the oaths:

 Mr. Strahan talked of launching into the great ocean of London, in order to have a chance for riſing to eminence, and obſerving that many men were kept back from trying their fortune there, becauſe they were born to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Small certainties are the bane of men of talents:"</q> which Johnſon confirmed. Mr. Strahan put Johnſon in mind of a remark which he had made to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q rend="inline">"There are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"The more one thinks of this, (ſaid Strahan,) the juſter it will appear."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Strahan had taken a poor boy from the country as an apprentice, upon Johnſon's recommendation. Johnſon having inquired after him, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Strahan, let me have five guineas on account, and I'll give this boy one. Nay, if a man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him, it is ſad work. Call him down."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I followed him into the court-yard, behind Mr. Strahan's houſe; and there I had a proof of what I had heard him profeſs, that he talked alike to all. <q rend="inline">"Some people (ſaid he,) tell you that they let themſelves down to the capacity of their hearers. I never do that. I ſpeak uniformly, in as intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible a manner as I can."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, my boy, how do you go on?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Pretty well, Sir; but they are afraid I an't ſtrong enough for ſome parts of the buſineſs."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why I ſhall be ſorry for it; for when you conſider with how little mental power and corporeal labour a printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very deſirable occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation for you. Do you hear,—take all the pains you can; and if this does not do, we muſt think of ſome other way of life for you. There's a guinea."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here was one of the many, many inſtances of his active benevolence. At the ſame time, the ſlow and ſonorous ſolemnity with which, while he bent himſelf down, he addreſſed a little thick ſhort-legged boy, contraſted with the boy's aukwardneſs and awe, could not but excite ſome ludicrous emotions.</p>
               <p>I met him at Drury-lane playhouſe in the evening. Sir Joſhua Reynolds, at Mrs. Abington's requeſt, had promiſed to bring a body of wits to her benefit; and having ſecured forty places in the front boxes, had done me the honour to put me in the groupe. Johnſon ſat on the ſeat directly behind me; and as he could neither ſee nor hear at ſuch a diſtance from the ſtage, he was wrapped up in grave abſtraction, and ſeemed quite a cloud, amidſt all the ſunſhine of glitter and gaiety. I wondered at his patience in ſitting out a play of five acts, and a farce of two. He ſaid very little; but after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to <q rend="inline">"Bon Ton"</q> had been ſpoken, which he could hear pretty well from the more ſlow and diſtinct utterance, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Dryden has written
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0548300101:496" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prologues ſuperiour to any that David Garrick has written; but David Garrick has written more good prologues than Dryden has done. It is wonderful that he has been able to write ſuch a variety of them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At Mr. Beauclerk's, where I ſupped, was Mr. Garrick, whom I made happy with Johnſon's praiſe of his prologues; and I ſuppoſe, in gratitude to him, he took up one of his favourite topicks, the nationality of the Scotch, which he maintained in his pleaſant manner, with the aid of a little poetical fiction. <q rend="inline">"Come, come, don't deny it: they are really national. Why, now, the Adams are as liberal-minded men as any in the world: but, I don't know how it is, all their workmen are Scotch. You are, to be ſure, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully free from that nationality; but ſo it happens, that you employ the only Scotch ſhoe-black in London."</q> He imitated the manner of his old maſter with ludicrous exaggeration; repeating, with pauſes and half whiſtlings interjected,
<q>
                     <l>"Os homini ſublime dedit,—caelumque tueri—</l>
                     <l>"Juſſit,—et erectos ad ſidera—tollere vultus."</l>
                  </q>
looking downwards all the time, and, while pronouncing the four laſt words, abſolutely touching the ground with a kind of contorted geſticulation.</p>
               <p>Garrick, however, when he pleaſed, could imitate Johnſon very exactly; for that great actor, with his diſtinguiſhed powers of expreſſion which were ſo univerſally admired, poſſeſſed alſo an admirable talent of mimickry. He was always jealous that Johnſon ſpoke lightly of him. I recollect his exhibiting him to me one day, as if ſaying <q rend="inline">"Davy is futile,"</q> which he uttered perfectly with the tone and air of Johnſon.</p>
               <p>I cannot too frequently requeſt of my readers while they peruſe my account of Johnſon's converſation, to endeavour to keep in mind his deliberate and ſtrong utterance. His mode of ſpeaking was indeed very impreſſive <note n="4" place="bottom">My noble friend Lord Pembroke ſaid once to me at Wilton, with a happy pleaſantry and ſome truth, that <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon's ſayings would not appear ſo extraordinary, were it not for his <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wow way."</hi>
                     </q> The ſayings themſelves are generally of ſterling merit; but, doubtleſs, his <hi>manner</hi> was an addition to their effect, and therefore ſhould be attended to as much as may be. It is neceſſary, however, to guard thoſe who were not acquainted with him, againſt overcharged imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or caricatures of his manner, which are frequently attempted, and many of which are ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand copies from the late Mr. Henderſon the actor, who, though a good mimick of ſome perſons, did not repreſent Johnſon correctly.</note>; and I wiſh it could be preſerved as muſick is written, according to the very

               <p>Next day I dined with Johnſon at Mr. Thrale's.

He was dull in a new way, and that made many people think him GREAT. He was a mechanical poet."</q> He then repeated ſome ludicrous lines, which have eſcaped my memory, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Is not that GREAT, like his Odes?"</q> Mrs. Thrale maintained that his Odes were melodious; upon which he exclaimed,
<q>
                     <l>"Weave the warp, and weave the woof;"—</l>
                  </q>

                  <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, there are but two good ſtanzas in Gray's poetry, which are in his 'Elegy in a Country Church-yard."</q> He then repeated the ſtanza,
<q>
                     <l>"For who to dumb forgetfulneſs a prey," &amp;c.</l>
                  </q>

               <p>A young lady who had married a man much her inferiour in rank being mentioned, a queſtion aroſe how a woman's relations ſhould behave to her in ſuch a ſituation; and, while I recapitulate the debate, and recollect what has ſince happened, I cannot but be ſtruck in a manner that delicacy forbids me to expreſs. While I contended that ſhe ought to be treated with an inflexible ſteadineſs of diſpleaſure, Mrs. Thrale was all for mildneſs and forgiveneſs, and,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0548300101:498"/>
according to the vulgar phraſe, making the beſt of a bad bargain. JOHNSON.  <q rend="inline">"Madam, we muſt diſtinguiſh. Were I a man of rank, I would not let a daughter ſtarve who had made a mean marriage; but having voluntarily degraded herſelf from the ſtation which ſhe was originally entitled to hold, I would ſupport her only in that which ſhe herſelf has choſen; and would not put her on a level with my other daughters. You are to conſider, Madam, that it is our duty to maintain the ſubordination of civiliſed ſociety; and when there is a groſs and ſhameful deviation from rank, it ſhould be puniſhed ſo as to deter others from the ſame perverſion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After frequently conſidering this ſubject, I am more and more confirmed in what I then meant to expreſs, and which was ſanctioned by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and illuſtrated by the wiſdom, of Johnſon; and I think it of the utmoſt conſequence to the happineſs of Society, to which ſubordination is abſolutely neceſſary. It is weak, and contemptible, and unworthy, in a parent to relax in ſuch a caſe. It is ſacrificing general advantage to private feelings. And let it be conſidered, that the claim of a daughter who has acted thus, to be reſtored to her former ſituation, is either fantaſtical or unjuſt. If there be no value in the diſtinction of rank, what does ſhe ſuffer by being kept in the ſituation to which ſhe has deſcended? If there be a value in that diſtinction, it ought to be ſteadily maintained. If indulgence be ſhewn to ſuch conduct, and the offenders know that in a longer or ſhorter time they ſhall be received as well as if they had not contaminated their blood by a baſe alliance, the great check upon that inordinate caprice which generally occaſions low mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, will be removed, and the fair and comfortable order of improved life will be miſerably diſturbed.</p>
               <p>Lord Cheſterfield's letters being mentioned, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It was not to be wondered at that they had ſo great a ſale, conſidering that they were the letters of a ſtateſman, a wit, one who had been ſo much in the mouths of mankind, one long accuſtomed <hi>virûm volitare per ora."</hi>

 Next morning I won a ſmall bett from Lady Diana Beauclerk, by aſking him as to one of his particularities, which her Ladyſhip laid I durſt not do. It ſeems he had been frequently obſerved at the club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had ſqueezed the juice of them into the drink which he made for himſelf. Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and ſeemed to think that he had a ſtrange unwillingneſs to be diſcovered. We could not divine what he did with them; and this was the bold queſtion to be put. I ſaw on his table the ſpoils of the preceding night, ſome freſh peels nicely ſcraped and cut into pieces. <q rend="inline">"O, Sir, (ſaid I,) I now partly ſee what you do with the ſqueezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the club."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I have a great love for them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And pray, Sir, what do you do with them?

               <p>He reviſed ſome ſheets of Lord Hailes's <q rend="inline">"Annals of Scotland,"</q> and wrote a few notes on the margin with red ink, which he bade me tell his Lordſhip did not ſink into the paper, and might be wiped off with a wet ſponge, ſo that he did not ſpoil his manuſcript. I told him there were very few of his friends ſo accurate as that I could venture to put down in writing what they told me as his ſayings. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why ſhould you write down <hi>my</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I write them when they are good."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, you may as well write down the ſayings of any one elſe that are good."</q> But <hi>where,</hi> I might with great propriety have added, can I find ſuch?</p>
               <p>I viſited him by appointment in the evening, and we drank tea with Mrs. Williams. He told me that he had been in the company of a gentleman whoſe extraordinary travels had been much the ſubject of converſation. But I found that he had not liſtened to him with that full confidence, without which there is little ſatisfaction in the ſociety of travellers. I was curious to hear what opinion ſo able a judge as Johnſon had formed of his abilities, and I aſked if he was not a man of ſenſe. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct relater; and I ſhould ſay, he is neither abounding nor deficient in ſenſe. I did not perceive any ſuperiority of underſtanding."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But will you not allow him a nobleneſs of reſolution, in penetrating into diſtant regions?"</q>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:0548300101:502" rendition="simple:additions"/>
JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, is not to the preſent purpoſe: we are talking of his ſenſe. A fighting cock has a nobleneſs of reſolution."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next day, Sunday, April 2, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole's. We talked of Pope. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He wrote his 'Dunciad' for fame. That was his primary motive. Had it not been for that, the dunces might have railed againſt him till they were weary, without his troubling himſelf about them. He delighted to vex them, no doubt; but he had more delight in ſeeing how well he could vex them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <q rend="inline">"Odes to Obſcurity and Oblivion,"</q> in ridicule of <q rend="inline">"cool Maſon and warm Gray,"</q> being mentioned, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They are Colman's beſt things."</q> Upon its being obſerved that it was believed theſe Odes were made by Colman and Lloyd jointly;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, how can two people make an Ode? Perhaps one made one of them, and one the other."</q> I obſerved that two people had made a play, and quoted the anecdote of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and Fletcher, who were brought under ſufpicion of treaſon, becauſe while concerting the plan of a tragedy when ſitting together at a tavern, one of them was overheard ſaying to the other, <q rend="inline">'I'll kill the King.'</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The firſt of theſe Odes is the beſt: but they are both good. They expoſed a very bad kind of writing."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Surely, Sir, Mr. Maſon's <q rend="inline">"Elfrida"</q> is a fine poem: at leaſt you will allow there are ſome good paſſages in it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"There are now and then ſome good imitations of Milton s bad manner."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I often wondered at his low eſtimation of the writings of Gray and Maſon. Of Gray's poetry I have, in a former part of this work, expreſſed my high opinion; and for that of Mr. Maſon I have ever entertained a warm admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. His <q rend="inline">"Elfrida"</q> is exquiſite, both in poetical deſcription and moral ſentiment; and his <q rend="inline">"Caractacus"</q> is a noble drama. Nor can I omit paying my tribute of praiſe to ſome of his ſmaller poems which I have read with pleaſure, and which no criticiſm ſhall perſuade me not to like. If I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at Johnſon's not taſting the works of Maſon and Gray, ſtill more have I wondered at their not taſting his works; that they ſhould be inſenſible to his energy of diction, to his ſplendour of images, and comprehenſion of thought. Taſtes may differ as to the violin, the flute, the hautboy, in ſhort, all the leſſer inſtruments: but who can be inſenſible to the powerful impreſſions of the majeſtick organ?</p>
               <p>His <q rend="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny"</q> being mentioned, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I think I have not been attacked enough for it. Attack is the re-action. I never think I
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0548300101:503" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 have hit hard, unleſs it rebounds."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't know, Sir, what you would be at. Five or ſix ſhots of ſmall arms in every newſpaper, and repeated cannonading in pamphlets, might, I think ſatisfy you. But, Sir, you'll never make out this match, of which we have talked, with a certain political lady, ſince you are ſo ſevere againſt her principles."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I have the better chance for that. She is like the Amazons of old; ſhe muſt be courted by the ſword. But I have not been ſevere upon her."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, you have made her ridiculous."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That was already done, Sir. To endeavour to make <hi>her</hi> ridiculous, is like blacking the chimney."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I put him in mind that the landlord at Ellon in Scotland ſaid, that he heard he was the greateſt man in England,—next to Lord Mansfield. <q rend="inline">"Aye, Sir, (ſaid he,) the exception defined the idea. A Scotchman could go no farther:
<q>
                        <l>"The force of Nature could no farther go."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Lady Miller's collection of verſes by faſhionable people, which were put into her Vaſe at Bathcaſton villa, near Bath. in competition for honorary prizes, being mentioned, he held them very cheap: <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>"Bouts rimés</hi> (ſaid he,) is a mere conceit, and an <hi>old</hi> conceit <hi>now;</hi> I wonder how people were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to write in that manner for this lady."</q> I named a gentleman of his acquaintance, who wrote for the Vaſe. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He was a blockhead for his pains."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The Ducheſs of Northumberland wrote."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the Ducheſs of Northumberland may do what ſhe pleaſes: nobody will ſay any thing to a lady of her high rank. But I ſhould be apt to throw ******'s verſes in his face."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked of the cheerfulneſs of Fleet-ſtreet, owing to the conſtant quick ſucceſſion of people which we perceive paſſing through it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, Fleet-ſtreet has a very animated appearance; but I think the full tide of human exiſtence is at Charing-croſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He made the common remark on the unhappineſs which men who have led a buſy life experience, when they retire in expectation of enjoying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at eaſe, and that they generally languiſh for want of their habitual occupation, and wiſh to return to it. He mentioned as ſtrong an inſtance of this as can well be imagined. <q rend="inline">"An eminent tallow-chandler in London, who had acquired a conſiderable fortune, gave up the trade in favour of his foreman, and went to live at a country-houſe near town. He ſoon grew weary, and paid frequent viſits to his old ſhop, where he deſired they might let him know
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0548300101:504" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their <hi>melting-days,</hi> and he would come and aſſiſt them; which he accordingly did. Here, Sir, was a man, to whom the moſt diſguſting circumſtance in the buſineſs to which he had been uſed, was a relief from idleneſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 5, I dined with him at Meſſieurs Dillys, with Mr. John Scott of Amwell, the Quaker, Mr. Langton, Mr. Miller, (now Sir John,) and Dr. Thomas Campbell, an Iriſh clergyman, whom I took the liberty of inviting to Meſſieurs Dillys' table, having ſeen him at Mr. Thrale's, and been told that he had come to England chiefly with a view to ſee Dr. Johnſon, for whom he entertained the higheſt veneration. He has ſince publiſhed <q rend="inline">"A philoſophical Survey of the South of Ireland,"</q> a very entertaining book, which has, however, one fault;—that it aſſumes the fictitious character of an Engliſhman.</p>
               <p>We talked of publick ſpeaking.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We muſt not eſtimate a man's powers by his being able or not able to deliver his ſentiments in publick. Iſaac Hawkins Browne, one of the firſt wits of this country, got into parliament, and never opened his mouth. For my own part, I think it is more diſgraceful never to try to ſpeak, than to try it and fail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is more diſgraceful not to fight, than to fight and be beaten."</q> This argument appeared to me fallacious; for if a man has not ſpoken, it may be ſaid that he would have done very well if he had tried; whereas, if he has tried and failed, there is nothing to be ſaid for him. <q rend="inline">"Why then, (I aſked,) is it thought diſgraceful for a man not to fight, and not diſgraceful not to ſpeak in publick?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe there may be other reaſons for a man's not ſpeaking in publick than want of reſolution: he may have nothing to ſay, (laughing). Whereas, Sir, you know courage is reckoned the greateſt of all virtues; becauſe, unleſs a man has that virtue, he has no ſecurity for preſerving any other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"the ſtatutes againſt bribery were intended to prevent upſtarts with money from getting into parliament;"</q> adding, that <q rend="inline">"if he were a gentleman of landed property, he would turn out all his tenants who did not vote for the candidate whom he ſupported."</q> LANGTON. <q rend="inline">"Would not that, Sir, be checking the freedom of election?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the law does not mean that the privilege of voting ſhould be independent of old family intereſt, of the permanent property of the country."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 6, I dined with him at Mr. Thomas Davies's, with Mr. Hicky the painter, and my old acquaintance Mr. Moody the player.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon, as uſual, ſpoke contemptuouſly of Colley Cibber. <q rend="inline">"It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful that a man, who for forty years had lived with the great and the witty. ſhould have acquired ſo ill the talents of converſation: and he had but half to
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0548300101:505" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 furniſh; for one half of what he ſaid was oaths."</q> He, however, allowed conſiderable merit to ſome of his comedies, and ſaid there was no reaſon to believe that <q rend="inline">"The Careleſs Huſband"</q> was not written by himſelf. Davies ſaid, he was the firſt dramatick writer who introduced genteel ladies upon the ſtage. Johnſon refuted this obſervation by inſtancing ſeveral ſuch characters in comedies before his time. DAVIES. (trying to defend himſelf from a charge of ignorance,) <q rend="inline">"I mean genteel moral characters."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I think (ſaid Hicky,) gentility and morality are inſeparable."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"By no means, Sir. The genteeleſt characters are often the moſt immoral. Does not Lord Cheſterfield give precepts for uniting wickedneſs and the graces? A man, indeed, is not genteel when he gets drunk; but moſt vices may be committed very genteely: a man may debauch his friend's wife genteely: he may cheat at cards genteely."</q> HICKY. <q rend="inline">"I do not think <hi>that</hi> is genteel."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it may not be like a gentleman, but it may be genteel."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are meaning two different things. One means exteriour grace; the other honour. It is certain, that a man may be very immoral with exteriour grace. Lovelace, in 'Clariſſa,' is a very genteel and a very wicked character. Tom Hervey, who died t'other day, though a vicious man, was one of the genteeleſt men that ever lived."</q> Tom Davies inſtanced Charles the Second. JOHNSON, (taking fire at any attack upon this Prince, for whom he had an extraordinary partiality,) <q rend="inline">"Charles the Second was licentious in his practice; but he always had a reverence for what was good. Charles the Second knew his people, and rewarded merit. The Church was at no time better filled than in his reign. He was the beſt King we have had from his time till the reign of his preſent Majeſty, except James the Second, who was a very good King, but unhappily believed that it was neceſſary for the ſalvation of his ſubjects that they ſhould be Roman Catholicks. <hi>He</hi> had the merit of endeavouring to do what he thought was for the ſalvation of the ſouls of his ſubjects, till he loſt a great empire. <hi>We,</hi> who thought that we ſhould <hi>not</hi> be ſaved if we were Roman Catholicks, had the merit of maintaining our religion, at the expence of ſubmitting ourſelves to the government of King William, (for it could not be done otherwiſe,)—to the government of one of the moſt worthleſs ſcoundrels that ever exiſted. No; Charles the Second was not ſuch a man as—, (naming another King). He did not deſtroy his father's will. He took money, indeed, from France: but he did not betray thoſe over whom he ruled: he did not let the French fleet paſs ours. George the Firſt knew nothing, and deſired to know nothing; did nothing, and deſired to do nothing: and the only good thing that is told of him is, that he wiſhed to reſtore the crown to its hereditary ſucceſſor."</q> He roared with prodigious
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:0548300101:506" rendition="simple:additions"/>
violence againſt George the Second. When he ceaſed, Moody interjected, in an Iriſh tone, and with a comick look, <q rend="inline">"Ah! poor George the Second."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned that Dr. Thomas Campbell had come from Ireland to London, principally to ſee Dr. Johnſon. He ſeemed angry at this obſervation. DAVIES. <q rend="inline">"Why, you know, Sir, there came a man from Spain to ſee Livy <note n="9" place="bottom">Plin. Epiſt. Lib. ii. Fp. 3.</note>; and Corelli came to England to ſee Purcell, and, when he heard he was dead, went directly back again to Italy."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould not have wiſhed to be dead to diſappoint Campbell, had he been ſo fooliſh as you repreſent him; but I ſhould have wiſhed to have been a hundred miles off."</q> This was apparently perverſe; and I do believe it was not his real way of thinking: he could not but like a man who came ſo far to ſee him. He laughed with ſome complacency, when I told him Campbell's odd expreſſion to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him: <q rend="inline">"That having ſeen ſuch a man, was a thing to talk of a century hence;"</q>—as if he could live ſo long.</p>
               <p>We got into an argument whether the Judges who went to India might with propriety engage in trade. Johnſon warmly maintained that they might. <q rend="inline">"For why (he urged) ſhould not Judges get riches, as well as thoſe who deſerve them leſs."</q> I ſaid, they ſhould have ſufficient ſalaries, and have nothing to take off their attention from the affairs of the publick. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No Judge, Sir, can give his whole attention to his office; and it is very proper that he ſhould employ what time he has to himſelf, for his own advantage, in the moſt profitable manner."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, (ſaid Davies, who enlivened the diſpute by making it ſomewhat dramatick,) he may become an inſurer; and when he is going to the bench, he may be ſtopped,—'Your Lordſhip cannot go yet: here is a bunch of invoices: ſeveral ſhips are about to ſail."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you may as well ſay a judge ſhould not have a houſe; for they may come and tell him, 'Your Lordſhip's houſe is on fire;' and ſo, inſtead of minding the buſineſs of his Court, he is to be occupied in getting the engine with the greateſt ſpeed. There is no end of this. Every Judge who has land, trades to a certain extent in corn or in cattle; and in the land itſelf, undoubtedly. His ſteward acts for him, and ſo do clerks for a great merchant. A Judge may be a farmer; but he is not to geld his own pigs. A Judge may play a little at cards for his amuſement; but he is not to play at marbles, or at chuck-farthing in the Piazza. No, Sir; there is no profeſſion to which a man gives a very great proportion of his time. It is wonderful when a calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is made, how little the mind is actually employed in the diſcharge of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:0548300101:507"/>
 any profeſſion. No man would be a Judge, upon the condition of being obliged to be totally a Judge. The beſt employed lawyer has his mind at work but for a ſmall proportion of his time: a great deal of his occupation is merely mechanical.—I once wrote for a magazine: I made a calculation, that if I ſhould write but a page a day, at the ſame rate, I ſhould, in ten years, write nine volumes in folio, of an ordinary ſize and print."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Such as Carte's Hiſtory?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir. When a man writes from his own mind, he writes very rapidly <note n="1" place="bottom">Johns;on certainly did, who had a mind ſtored with knowledge, and teeming with imagery: but the obſervation is not applicable to writers in general.</note>. The greateſt part of a writer's time is ſpent in reading, in order to write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man will turn over half a library to make one book."</q>

               <p>I argued warmly againſt the Judges trading, and mentioned Hale as an inſtance of a perfect Judge, who devoted himſelf entirely to his office. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Hale, Sir, attended to other things beſide law: he left a great eſtate."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That was, becauſe what he got, accumulated without any exertion and anxiety on his part."</q>

               <p>While the diſpute went on, Moody once tried to ſay ſomething upon our ſide. Tom Davies clapped him on the back, to encourage him. Beauclerk, to whom I mentioned this circumſtance, ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"he could not conceive a more humiliating ſituation than to be clapped on the back by Tom Davies."</q>

               <p>We ſpoke of Rolt, to whoſe Dictionary of Commerce, Dr. Johnſon wrote the Preface. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Old Gardner the bookſeller employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miſcellany, called 'The Viſitor.' There was a formal written contract, which Allen the printer ſaw. Gardner thought as you do of the Judge. They were bound to write nothing elſe. They were to have, I think, a third of the profits of this ſixpenny pamphlet; and the contract was for ninety-nine years. I wiſh I had thought of giving this to Thurlow, in the cauſe about Literary Property. What an excellent inſtance would it have been of the oppreſſion of bookſellers towards poor authours!"</q> (ſmiling). Davies, zealous for the honour of <hi>the Trade,</hi> ſaid, Gardner was not properly a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he certainly was a bookſeller. He had ſerved his time regularly, was a member of the Stationers' company, kept a ſhop in the face of mankind, purchaſed copy-right, and was a <hi>bibliopole,</hi> Sir, in every ſenſe. I wrote for ſome months in 'The Viſitor,' for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write, and thinking I was doing him good. I hoped his wits would ſoon return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'The Viſitor' no longer.</q>

Friday, April 7, I dined with him at a tavern, with a numerous company.  JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I have been reading 'Twiſs's Travels in Spain,' which are juſt come out. They are as good as the firſt book of travels that you will take up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are as good as thoſe of Keyſler or Blainville; nay, as Addiſon's, if you except the learning. They are not ſo good as Brydone's, but they are better than Pococke's. I have not, indeed, cut the leaves yet; but I have read in them where the pages are open, and I do not ſuppoſe that what is in the pages which are cloſed is worſe than what is in the open pages.—It would ſeem (he added,) that Addiſon had not acquired much Italian learning, for we do not find it introduced into his writings. The only inſtance that I recollect, is his quoting <hi>'Stavo bene. Per ſtar meglio, ſto qui."</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Addiſon's having borrowed many of his claſſical remarks from Leandro Alberti. Mr. Beauclerk ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It was alledged that he had borrowed alſo from another Italian authour."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, all who go to look for what the Claſſicks have ſaid of Italy muſt find the ſame paſſages; and I ſhould think it would be one of the firſt things the Italians would do on the revival of learning, to collect all that the Roman authours had ſaid of their country."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Oſſian being mentioned;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Suppoſing the Iriſh and Erſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages to be the ſame, which I do not believe, yet as there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the inhabitants of the Highlands and Hebrides ever wrote their native language, it is not to be credited that a long poem was preſerved among them. If we had no evidence of the art of writing being practiſed in one of the counties of England, we ſhould not believe that a long poem was preſerved <hi>there,</hi> though in the neighbouring counties, where the ſame language was ſpoken, the inhabitants could write."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"The ballad of Lulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balero was once in the mouths of all the people of this country, and is ſaid to have had a great effect in bringing about the Revolution. Yet I queſtion whether any body can repeat it now; which ſhews how improbable it is that much poetry ſhould be preſerved by tradition."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the company ſuggeſted an internal objection to the antiquity of the poetry ſaid to be Oſſian's, that we do not find the wolf in it, which muſt have been the caſe had it been of that age.</p>
               <p>The mention of the wolf had led Johnſon to think of other wild beaſts; and while Sir Joſhua Reynolds and Mr. Langton were carrying on a dialogue about ſomething which engaged them earneſtly, he, in the midſt of it, broke out, <q rend="inline">"Pennant tells of Bears—"</q> [what he added, I have forgotten.] They went on, which he being dull of hearing, did not perceive, or, if he did, was
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0548300101:509" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 not willing to break off his talk; ſo he continued to vociferate his remarks, and <hi>Bear</hi> (<q rend="inline">"like a word in a catch,"</q> as Beauclerk ſaid,) was repeatedly heard at intervals, which coming from him who, by thoſe who did not know him, had been ſo often aſſimilated to that ferocious animal, while we who were ſitting around could hardly ſtifle laughter, produced a very ludicrous effect. Silence having enſued, he proceeded: <q rend="inline">"We are told, that the black bear is innocent; but I ſhould not like to truſt myſelf with him."</q> Mr. Gibbon mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, in a low tone of voice, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould not like to truſt myſelf with <hi>you."</hi>
                  </q> This piece of ſarcaſtick pleaſantry was a prudent reſolution, if applied to a competition of abilities.</p>
               <p>Patriotiſm having become one of our topicks, Johnſon ſuddenly uttered, in a ſtrong determined tone, an apothegm, at which many will ſtart: <q rend="inline">"Patriotiſm is the laſt refuge of a ſcoundrel."</q> But let it be conſidered, that he did not mean a real and generous love of our country, but that pretended patriotiſm which ſo many, in all ages and countries, have made a cloak for ſelf-intereſt. I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maintained, that certainly all patriots were not ſcoundrels. Being urged (not by Johnſon,) to name one exception, I mentioned an eminent perſon, whom we all greatly admired. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I do not ſay that he is <hi>not</hi> honeſt; but we have no reaſon to conclude from his political conduct that he <hi>is</hi> honeſt. Were he to accept of a place from this miniſtry, he would loſe that character of firmneſs which he has, and might be turned out of his place in a year. This miniſtry is neither ſtable, nor grateful to their friends, as Sir Robert Walpole was: ſo that he may think it more for his intereſt to take his chance of his party coming in."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Pritchard being mentioned, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Her playing was quite mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. It is wonderful how little mind ſhe had. Sir, ſhe had never read the tragedy of Macbeth all through. She no more thought of the play out of which her part was taken, than a ſhoemaker thinks of the ſkin, out of which the piece of leather, of which he is making a pair of ſhoes, is cut.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, where we met the Iriſh Dr. Campbell. Johnſon had ſupped the night before at Mrs. Abington's, with ſome faſhionable people whom he named; and he ſeemed much pleaſed with having made one in ſo elegant a circle.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale, who frequently practiſed a coarſe mode of flattery, by repeating his <hi>bon mots</hi> in his hearing, told us that he had ſaid, a certain celebrated actor was juſt fit to ſtand at the door of an auction-room, with a long pole, and cry, <q rend="inline">"Pray, gentlemen, walk in;"</q> and that a certain authour, upon hearing this, had ſaid, that another ſtill more celebrated actor was fit for nothing better than
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0548300101:510"/>
that, and would pick your pocket after you came out. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, my dear lady, there is no wit in what our friend added; there is only abuſe. You may as well ſay of any man that he will pick a pocket. Beſides, the man who is ſtationed at the door does not pick people's pockets: that is done within, by the auctioneer."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale told us, that Tom Davies repeated, in a very bald manner, the ſtory of Dr. Johnſon's firſt repartee to me, which I have related exactly <note n="2" place="bottom">Page 211.</note>. He made me ſay, <q rend="inline">"I <hi>was born</hi> in Scotland,"</q> inſtead of <q rend="inline">"I <hi>come from</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;"</q> ſo that Johnſon's ſaying, <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help,"</q> had no point, or even meaning: and that upon this being mentioned to Mr. Fitzherbert, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"It is not every man that can <hi>carry</hi> a <hi>bon mot."</hi>

               <p>On Monday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, with Mr. Langton and the Iriſh Dr. Campbell, whom the General had obligingly given me leave to bring with me. This learned gentleman was thus gratified with a very high intellectual feaſt, by not only being in company with Dr. Johnſon, but with General Oglethorpe, who had been ſo long a celebrated name both at home and abroad <note n="3" place="bottom">Let me here be allowed to pay my tribute of moſt ſincere gratitude to the memory of that excellent perſon, my intimacy with whom was the more valuable to me, becauſe my firſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him was unexpected and unſolicited. Soon after the publication of my <q rend="inline">"Account of Corſica,"</q> he did me the honour to call on me, and approaching me with a frank courteous air, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"My name, Sir, is Oglethorpe, and I wiſh to be acquainted with you."</q> I was not a little ſlattered to be thus addreſſed by an eminent man, of whom I had read in Pope, from my early years,
<q>
                        <l>"Or, driven by ſtrong benevolence of ſoul,</l>

                     </q>
I was fortunate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enough to be found worthy of his good opinion, inſomuch, that I not only was invited to make one in the many reſpectable companies whom he entertained at his table, but had a cover at his hoſpitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               <p>I muſt, again and again, intreat of my readers not to ſuppoſe that my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect record of converſation contains the whole of what was ſaid by Johnſon, or other eminent perſons who lived with him. What I have preſerved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, has the value of the moſt perfect authenticity.</p>
               <p>He this day enlarged upon Pope's melancholy remark,

 He aſſerted, that <hi>the preſent</hi> was never a happy ſtate to any human being; but that, as every part of life, of which we are conſcious, was at ſome point of time a period yet to come, in which felicity was expected, there was ſome happineſs produced by hope. Being preſſed upon this ſubject, and aſked if he really was of opinion that though, in general, happineſs was very rare in human life, a man was not ſometimes happy in the moment that was preſent, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Never, but when he is drunk."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He urged General Oglethorpe to give the world his Life. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I know no man whoſe Life would be more intereſting. If I were furniſhed with materials, I ſhould be very glad to write it <note n="4" place="bottom">The General ſeemed unwilling to enter upon it at this time; but upon a ſubſequent occaſion he communicated to me a number of particulars, which I have committed to writing; but I was not ſufficiently diligent in obtaining more from him, not apprehending that his friends were ſo ſoon to loſe him; for notwithſtanding his great age, he was very healthy and vigorous, and was at laſt carried off by a violent fever, which is often fatal at any period of life.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Scott of Amwell's Elegies were lying in the room. Dr. Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"They are very well; but ſuch as twenty people might write."</q> Upon this I took occaſion to controvert Horace's maxim,
<q>
                     <l>"—mediocribus eſſe poetis</l>

                  </q>
for here (I obſerved,) was a very middle-rate poet, who pleaſed many readers, and therefore poetry of a middle ſort was entitled to ſome eſteem; nor could I ſee why poetry ſhould not, like every thing elſe, have different gradations of excellence, and, conſequently of value. Johnſon repeated the common remark, that <q rend="inline">"as there is no neceſſity for our having poetry at all, it being merely a luxury, an inſtrument of pleaſure, it can have no value, unleſs when exquiſite in its kind."</q> I declared myſelf not ſatisfied. <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir, (ſaid he,) Horace and you muſt ſettle it."</q> He was not much in the humour of talking.</p>
               <p>No more of his converſation for ſome days appears in my journal, except that when a gentleman told him he had bought a ſuit of laces for his lady. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, you have done a good thing, and a wiſe thing."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I have done a good thing, (ſaid the gentleman,) but I do not know that I have done a wiſe thing."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; no money is better ſpent than what is laid out for domeſtick ſatisfaction.

On Friday, April 14, being Good-Friday, I repaired to him in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to my uſual cuſtom on this day, and breakfaſted with him. I obſerved that he faſted ſo very ſtrictly, that he did not even taſte bread, and took no milk with his tea, I ſuppoſe becauſe it is a kind of animal food.</p>
               <p>He entered upon the ſtate of the nation, and thus diſcourſed: <q rend="inline">"Sir, the great misfortune now is, that government has too little power. All that it has to beſtow, muſt of neceſſity be given to ſupport itſelf; ſo that it cannot reward merit. No man, for inſtance, can now be made a Biſhop for his learning and piety <note n="3" place="bottom">From this too juſt obſervation there are ſome eminent exceptions.</note>; his only chance for promotion is his being connected with ſomebody who has parliamentary intereſt. Our ſeveral miniſtries in this reign have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid each other in conceſſions to the people. Lord Bute, though a very honourable man,—a man who meant well,—a man who had his blood full of prerogative,—was a theoretical ſtateſman,—a book-miniſter,—and thought this country could be governed by the influence of the Crown alone. Then, Sir, he gave up a great deal. He adviſed the King to agree that the Judges ſhould hold their places for life, inſtead of loſing them at the acceſſion of a new King. Lord Bute, I ſuppoſe, thought to make the King popular by this conceſſion; but the people never minded it; and it was a moſt impolitick meaſure. There is no reaſon why a Judge ſhould hold his office for life, more than any other perſon in publick truſt. A Judge may be partial otherwiſe than to the Crown: we have ſeen Judges partial to the populace. A Judge may become corrupt, and yet there may not be legal evidence againſt him. A Judge may become froward from age. A Judge may grow unfit for his office in many ways. It was deſirable that there ſhould be a poſſibility of being delivered from him by a new King. That is now gone by an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ex gratiâ</hi> of the Crown. Lord Bute adviſed the King to give up a very large ſum of money <note n="4" place="bottom">The money ariſing from the property of the prizes taken before the declaration of war, which were given to his Majeſty by the peace of Paris, and amounted to upwards of 700,000l. and from the lands in the ceded iſlands, which were eſtimated at 200,000l. more. Surely, there was a noble munificence in this gift from a Monarch to his people. And let it be remembered, that during the Earl of Bute's adminiſtration, the King was graciouſly pleaſed to give up the hereditary revenues of the Crown, and to accept, inſtead of them, of the limited ſum of 800,000l. a year; upon which Blackſtone obſerves, that <q rend="inline">"The hereditary revenues, being put under the ſame manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the other branches of the publick patrimony, will produce more, and be better collected than heretofore; and the publick is a gainer of upwards of 100,000l. <hi>per annum,</hi> by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted bounty of his Majeſty."</q>

                     </note>, for which nobody thanked him. It was of conſequence to the King, but nothing to the publick, among whom it was divided. When

 I ſay Lord Bute adviſed, I mean, that ſuch acts were done when he was miniſter, and we are to ſuppoſe that he adviſed them.—Lord Bute ſhewed an undue partiality to Scotchmen. He turned out Dr. Nichols, a very eminent man, from being phyſician to the King, to make room for one of his countrymen, a man very low in his profeſſion. He had *********** and **** to go on errands for him. He had occaſion for people to go on errands for him; but he ſhould not have had Scotchmen; and, certainly, he ſhould not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to have acceſs to him before the firſt people in England."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I told him, that the admiſſion of one of them before the firſt people in England, which had given the greateſt offence, was no more than what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens at every miniſter's levee, where thoſe who attend are admitted in the order that they have come, which is better than admitting them according to their rank; for if that were to be the rule, a man who has waited all the morning might have the mortification to ſee a peer, newly come, go in before him, and keep him waiting ſtill. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; but **** ſhould not have come to the levee, to be in the way of people of conſequence. He ſaw Lord Bute at all times; and could have ſaid what he had to ſay at any time, as well as at the levee. There is now no Prime Miniſter: there is only an agent for government in the Houſe of Commons. We are governed by the Cabinet; but there is no one head there, as in Sir Robert Walpole's time."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What then, Sir, is the uſe of Parliament?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, Parliament is a larger council to the King; and the advantage of ſuch a council is, having a great number of men of property concerned in the legiſlature, who, for their own intereſt, will not conſent to bad laws. And you muſt have obſerved, Sir, that adminiſtration is feeble and timid, and cannot act with that authority and reſolution which is neceſſary. Were I in power, I would turn out every man who dared to oppoſe me. Government has the diſtribution of offices, that it may be enabled to maintain its authority."</q>

As we walked to St. Clement's church, and ſaw ſeveral ſhops open upon this moſt ſolemn faſt-day of the Chriſtian world, I remarked, that one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage ariſing from the immenſity of London, was, that nobody was heeded by his neighbour; there was no fear of cenſure for not obſerving Good-Friday, as it ought to be kept, and as it is kept in country towns. He ſaid, it was, upon the whole, very well obſerved even in London. He, however, owned, that London was too large; but added, <q rend="inline">"It is nonſenſe to ſay the head is too big for the body. It would be as much too big, though the body were ever ſo large; that is to ſay, though the country were ever ſo extenſive. It has no ſimilarity to a head connected with a body."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Wetherell, Maſter of Univerſity College, Oxford, accompanied us home from church; and after he was gone, there came two other gentlemen, one of whom uttered the common-place complaints, that by the increaſe of taxes, labour would be dear, other nations would underſell us, and our commerce would be ruined. JOHNSON, (ſmiling). <q rend="inline">"Never fear, Sir. Our commerce is in a very good ſtate; and ſuppoſe we had no commerce at all, we could live very well on the produce of our own country."</q> I cannot omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I never knew any man who was leſs diſpoſed to be querulous than Johnſon. Whether the ſubject was his own ſituation, or the ſtate of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or the ſtate of human nature in general, though he ſaw the evils, his mind was turned to reſolution, and never to whining or complaint.</p>
               <p>We went again to St. Clement's in the afternoon. He had found fault with the preacher in the morning for not chooſing a text adapted to the day. The preacher in the afternoon had choſen one extremely proper: <q rend="inline">"It is finiſhed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the evening ſervice, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Come, you ſhall go home with me, and ſit juſt an hour."</q> But he was better than his word; for after we had drunk tea with Mrs. Williams, he aſked me to go up to his ſtudy with him, where we ſat a long while together in a ſerene undiſturbed frame of mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes in ſilence, and ſometimes converſing, as we felt ourſelves inclined, or more properly ſpeaking, as <hi>he</hi> was inclined; for during all the courſe of my long intimacy with him, my reſpectful attention never abated, and my wiſh to hear him was ſuch, that I conſtantly watched every dawning of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from that great and illuminated mind.</p>
               <p>He obſerved, <q rend="inline">"All knowledge is of itſelf of ſome value. There is nothing ſo minute or inconſiderable, that I would not rather know it than not. In the ſame manner, all power, of whatever ſort, is of itſelf deſirable. A man would not ſubmit to learn to hem a ruffle, of his wiſe, or his wife's maid; but if a mere wiſh could attain it, he would rather wiſh to be able to hem a ruffle."</q>

He had, till very near his death, a contempt for the notion that the weather affects the human frame.</p>
               <p>I told him that our friend Goldſmith had ſaid to me, that he had come too late into the world, for that Pope and other poets had taken up the places in the Temple of Fame; ſo that as but a few at any period can poſſeſs poetical reputation, a man of genius can now hardly acquire it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is one of the moſt ſenſible things I have ever heard of Goldſmith. It is difficult to get literary fame, and it is every day growing more difficult. Ah, Sir, that ſhould make a man think of ſecuring happineſs in another world, which all who try ſincerely for it may attain. In compariſon of that, how little are all other things! The belief of immortality is impreſſed upon all men, and all men act under an impreſſion of it, however they may talk, and though, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they may be ſcarcely ſenſible of it."</q> I ſaid, it appeared to me that ſome people had not the leaſt notion of immortality; and I mentioned a diſtinguiſhed gentleman of our acquaintance. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if it were not for the notion of immortality, he would cut a throat to fill his pockets."</q> When I quoted this to Beauclerk, who knew much more of the gentleman than we did, he ſaid, in his acid manner, <q rend="inline">"He would cut a throat to fill his pockets, if it were not for fear of being hanged."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon proceeded: <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is a great cry about infidelity; but there are, in reality, very few infidels. I have heard a perſon, originally a Quaker, but now, I am afraid, a Deiſt, ſay, that he did not believe there were, in all England, above two hundred infidels."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was pleaſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"If you come to ſettle here, we will have one day in the week on which we will meet by ourſelves. That is the happieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation where there is no competition, no vanity, but a calm quiet inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſentiments."</q> In his private regiſter this evening is thus marked, <q rend="inline">"Boſwell ſat with me till night; we had ſome ſerious talk <note n="5" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 138.</note>."</q> It alſo appears from the ſame record, that after I left him he was occupied in religious duties, in <q rend="inline">"giving Francis, his ſervant, ſome directions for preparation to communicate; in reviewing his life, and reſolving on better conduct."</q> The humility and piety which he diſcovers on ſuch occaſions, is truly edifying. No ſaint, however, in the courſe of his religious warfare, was more ſenſible of the unhappy failure of pious reſolves, than Johnſon. He ſaid one day, talking to an acquaintance on this ſubject, <q rend="inline">"Sir, Hell is paved with good intentions."</q>

On Sunday, April 16, being Eaſter-day, after having attended the ſolemn ſervice at St. Paul's, I dined with Dr. Johnſon and Mrs. Williams. I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Horace was wrong in placing happineſs in <hi>Nil admirari,</hi> for that I thought admiration one of the moſt agreeable of all our feelings; and I regretted that I had loſt much of my diſpoſition to admire, which people generally do as they advance in life. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, as a man advances in life, he gets what is better than admiration,—judgement, to eſtimate things at their true value."</q> I ſtill inſiſted that admiration was more pleaſing than judgement, as love is more pleaſing than friendſhip. The feeling of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is like that of being comfortably filled with roaſt-beef; love, like being enlivened with champagne. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; admiration and love are like being intoxicated with champagne; judgement and friendſhip like being enlivened.

               <p>He then took occaſion to enlarge on the advantages of reading, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the idle ſuperficial notion, that knowledge enough may be acquired in converſation. <q rend="inline">"The foundation (ſaid he,) muſt be laid by reading.

               <p>On Tueſday, April 18, he and I were engaged to go with Sir Joſhua Reynolds to dine with Mr. Cambridge, at his beautiful villa on the banks of the Thames, near Twickenham. Dr. Johnſon's tardineſs was ſuch, that Sir Joſhua, who had an appointment at Richmond early in the day, was obliged to go by himſelf on horſeback, leaving his coach to Johnſon and me. Johnſon was in ſuch good ſpirits, that every thing ſeemed to pleaſe him as we drove along.</p>
               <p>Our converſation turned on a variety of ſubjects. He thought portrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painting an improper employment for a woman. <q rend="inline">"Publick practice of any art, (he obſerved,) and ſtaring in men's faces, is very indelicate in a female."</q>

 I happened to ſtart a queſtion of propriety, whether when a man knows that ſome of his intimate friends are invited to the houſe of another friend, with whom they are all equally intimate, he may join them without an invitation. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; he is not to go when he is not invited. They may be invited on purpoſe to abuſe him,"</q> (ſmiling).</p>
               <p>As a curious inſtance how little a man knows, or wiſhes to know, his own character in the world, or, rather, as a convincing proof that Johnſon's roughneſs was only external, and did not proceed from his heart, I inſert the following dialogue. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful, Sir, how rare a quality good humour is in life. We meet with very few good humoured men."</q> I mentioned four of our friends, none of whom he would allow to be good humoured. One was <hi>acid,</hi> another was <hi>muddy,</hi> and to the others he had objections which have eſcaped me. Then, ſhaking his head and ſtretching himſelf at his eaſe in the coach, and ſmiling with much complacency, he turned to me and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I look upon <hi>myſelf</hi> as a good humoured fellow."</q> The epithet <hi>fellow,</hi> applied to the great Lexicographer, the ſtately Moraliſt, the maſterly Critick, as if he had been <hi>Sam</hi> Johnſon, a mere pleaſant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, was highly diverting; and this light notion of himſelf ſtruck me with wonder. I anſwered, alſo ſmiling, <q rend="inline">"No, no, Sir; that will <hi>not</hi> do. You are good natured, but not good humoured: you are iraſcible. You have not patience with folly and abſurdity. I believe you would pardon them, if there were time to deprecate your vengeance; but puniſhment follows ſo quick after ſentence, that they cannot eſcape."</q>

               <p>I had brought with me a great bundle of Scotch magazines and newſpapers, in which his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands"</q> was attacked in every mode; and I read a great part of them to him, knowing they would afford him entertainment. I wiſh the writers of them had been preſent: they would have been ſufficiently vexed. One ludicrous imitation of his ſtyle, by Mr. Maclaurin, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dreghorn, was diſtinguiſhed by him from the rude maſs. <q rend="inline">"This (ſaid he,) is the beſt. But I could caricature my own ſtyle much better myſelf."</q> He defended his remark upon the general inſufficiency of education in Scotland; and confirmed to me the authenticity of his witty ſaying on the learning of the Scotch;—<q rend="inline">"Their learning is like bread in a beſieged town: every man gets a little, but no man gets a full meal."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"There is (ſaid he,) in Scotland a diffuſion of learning, a certain portion of it widely and thinly ſpread. A merchant there has as much learning as one of their clergy."</q>

He talked of Iſaac Walton's Lives, which was one of his moſt favourite books. Dr. Donne's Life, he ſaid, was the moſt perfect of them. He obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"it was wonderful that Walton, who was in a very low ſituation in life, ſhould have been familiarly received by ſo many great men, and that at a time when the ranks of ſociety were kept more ſeparate than they are now."</q> He ſuppoſed that Walton had then given up his buſineſs as a linen-draper and ſempſter, and was only an authour; and added, <q rend="inline">"that he was a great panegyriſt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"No quality will get a man more friends than a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to admire the qualities of others. I do not mean flattery, but a ſincere admiration."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, flattery pleaſes very generally.

               <p>No ſooner had we made our bow to Mr. Cambridge, in his library, than Johnſon ran eagerly to one ſide of the room, intent on poring over the backs of the books. Sir Joſhua obſerved, (aſide,) <q rend="inline">"He runs to the books, as I do to the pictures: but I have the advantage. I can ſee much more of the pictures than he can of the books."</q> Mr. Cambridge, upon this, politely ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon, I am going, with your pardon, to accuſe myſelf, for I have the ſame cuſtom which I perceive you have. But it ſeems odd that one ſhould have ſuch a deſire to look at the backs of books."</q> Johnſon, ever ready for conteſt, inſtantly ſtarted from his reverie, wheeled about, and anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the reaſon is very plain. Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a ſubject ourſelves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we inquire into any ſubject, the firſt thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and at the backs of books in libraries."</q> Sir Joſhua obſerved to me, the extraordinary prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with which Johnſon flew upon an argument. <q rend="inline">"Yes, (ſaid I,) he has no formal preparation, no flouriſhing with his ſword; he is through your body in an inſtant."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon was here ſolaced with an elegant entertainment, a very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed family, and much good company; among whom was Mr. Harris of Saliſbury, who paid him many compliments on his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands."</q>

               <p>The common remark as to the utility of reading hiſtory being made;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We muſt conſider how very little hiſtory there is; I mean real authentick hiſtory. That certain Kings reigned, and certain battles were fought, we can depend upon as true; but all the colouring, all the philoſophy,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0548300101:519" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of hiſtory is conjecture."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, you would reduce all hiſtory to no better than an almanack, a mere chronological ſeries of remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able events."</q> Mr. Gibbon, who muſt at that time have been employed upon his hiſtory, of which he publiſhed the firſt volume in the following year, was preſent, but did not ſtep forth in defence of that ſpecies of writing.

               <p>Johnſon obſerved, that the force of our early habits was ſo great, that though reaſon approved, nay, though our ſenſes reliſhed a different courſe, almoſt every man returned to them. I do not believe there is any obſervation upon human nature better founded than this; and, in many caſes, it is a very painful truth; for where early habits have been mean and wretched, the joy and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſulting from better modes of life, muſt be damped by the gloomy conſciouſneſs of being under an almoſt inevitable doom to ſink back into a ſituation which we recollect with diſguſt.

                  <q rend="inline">"The Beggars Opera,"</q> and the common queſtion, whether it was pernicious in its effects, having been introduced;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"As to this matter, which has been very much conteſted, I myſelf am of opinion, that more influence has been aſcribed to 'The Beggars Opera,' than it in reality ever had; for I do not believe that any man was ever made a rogue by being preſent at its repreſentation. At the ſame time I do not deny that it may have ſome influence, by making the character of a rogue familiar, and in ſome degree pleaſing <note n="8" place="bottom">A very eminent phyſician, whoſe diſcernment is as acute and penetrating in judging of the human character as it is in his own profeſſion, remarked once at a club where I was, that a lively young man, fond of pleaſure and without money, would hardly reſiſt a ſolicitation from his miſtreſs to go upon the highway, immediately after being preſent at the repreſentation of <q rend="inline">"The Beggars Opera."</q> I have been told of an ingenious obſervation by Mr. Gibbon, that <q rend="inline">"The Beggars Opera may, perhaps, have ſometimes increaſed the number of highwaymen; but that it has had a beneficial effect in refining that claſs of men, making them leſs ferocious, more polite, in ſhort, more like gentlemen."</q> Upon this Mr. Courtenay ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"Gay was the Orpheus of highwaymen."</q>
                     </note>."</q> Then collecting himſelf, as it were, to give a heavy ſtroke: <q rend="inline">"There is in it ſuch a <hi>labefactation</hi> of all principles, as may be injurious to morality."</q>

               <p>While he pronounced this reſponſe, we ſat in a comical ſort of reſtraint, ſmothering a laugh, which we were afraid might burſt out.

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0548300101:520" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for, indeed, not only are the gaiety and heroiſm of a highwayman very captivating to a youthful imagination, but the arguments for adventurous depredation are ſo plauſible, the alluſions ſo lively, and the contraſts with the ordinary and more painful modes of acquiring property are ſo artfully diſplayed, that it requires a cool and ſtrong judgement to reſiſt ſo impoſing an aggregate: yet, I own, I ſhould be very ſorry to have <q rend="inline">"The Beggars Opera"</q> ſuppreſſed; for there is in it ſo much of real London life, ſo much brilliant wit, and ſuch a variety of airs, which, from early aſſociation of ideas, engage, ſoothe, and enliven the mind, that no performance which the theatre exhibits, delights me more.</p>

                  </q> Duke of Queenſberry, as Thomſon, in his <q rend="inline">"Seaſons,"</q> juſtly characteriſes him, told me, that when Gay firſt ſhewed him <q rend="inline">"The Beggars Opera,"</q> his Grace's obſervation was, <q rend="inline">"This is a very odd thing, Gay; I am ſatisfied that it is either a very good thing, or a very bad thing."</q> It proved the former, beyond the warmeſt expectations of the authour or his friends. Mr. Cambridge, however, ſhewed us to day, that there was good reaſon enough to doubt concerning its ſucceſs. He was told by Quin, that during the firſt night of its appearance it was long in a very dubious ſtate; that there was a diſpoſition to damn it, and that it was ſaved by the ſong, <q rend="inline">"Oh ponder well, be not ſevere."</q> Quin himſelf had ſo bad an opinion of it, that he refuſed the part of Captain Macheath, and gave it to Walker, who acquired great celebrity by his grave yet animated performance of it.</p>
               <p>We talked of a young gentleman's marriage with an eminent ſinger, and his determination that ſhe ſhould no longer ſing in publick, though his father was very earneſt ſhe ſhould, becauſe her talents would be liberally rewarded ſo as to make her a good fortune. It was queſtioned whether the young gentleman, who had not a ſhilling in the world, but was bleſt with very uncommon talents, was not fooliſhly delicate, or fooliſhly proud, and his father truly rational without being mean. Johnſon, with all the high ſpirit of a Roman ſenator, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"He reſolved wiſely and nobly to be ſure. He is a brave man. Would not a gentleman be diſgraced by having his wife ſinging publickly for hire? No, Sir, there can be no doubt here. I know not if I ſhould not <hi>prepare</hi> myſelf for a publick ſinger, as readily as let my wife be one."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon arraigned the modern politicks of this country, as entirely devoid of all principle of whatever kind. <q rend="inline">"Politicks (ſaid he) are now nothing more than means of riſing in the world. With this ſole view do men engage in politicks, and their whole conduct proceeds upon it. How different in that reſpect is the ſtate of the nation now from what it was in
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0548300101:521" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the time of Charles the Firſt, during the Uſurpation, and after the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the time of Charles the Second. Hudibras affords a ſtrong proof how much hold political principles had then upon the minds of men. There is in Hudibras a great deal of bullion, which will always laſt. But to be ſure the brighteſt ſtrokes of his wit owed their force to the impreſſion of the characters, which was upon men's minds at the time; to their knowing them, at table and in the ſtreet; in ſhort, being familiar with them; and above all, to his ſatire being directed againſt thoſe whom a little while before they had hated and feared. The nation in general has ever been loyal, has been at all times attached to the monarch, though a few daring rebels have been wonderfully powerful for a time. The murder of Charles the Firſt was undoubtedly not committed with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the approbation or conſent of the people. Had that been the caſe, parliament would not have ventured to conſign the regicides to their deſerved puniſhment. And we know what exuberance of joy there was when Charles the Second was reſtored. If Charles the Second had bent all his mind to it, had made it his ſole object, he might have been as abſolute as Louis the Fourteenth."</q> A gentleman obſerved he would have done no harm if he had. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, abſolute princes ſeldom do any harm. But they who are governed by them are governed by chance. There is no ſecurity for good government."</q> CAMBRIDGE. <q rend="inline">"There have been many ſad victims to abſolute power."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, have there been to popular factions."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The queſtion is, which is worſt, one wild beaſt or many?"</q>

               <p>Johnſon praiſed <q rend="inline">"The SPECTATOR,"</q> particularly the character of Sir Roger de Coverley. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir Roger did not die a violent death, as has been generally fancied. He was not killed; he died only becauſe others were to die, and becauſe his death afforded an opportunity to Addiſon for ſome very fine writing. We have the example of Cervantes màking Don Quixote die.—I never could ſee why Sir Roger is repreſented as a little cracked.

               <p>Having ſet out next day on a viſit to the Earl of Pembroke, at Wilton, and to my friend, Mr. Temple, at Mamhead, in Devonſhire, and not having returned to town till the ſecond of May, I did not ſee Dr. Johnſon for a conſiderable time, and during the remaining part of my ſtay in London, kept very imperfect notes of his converſation, which had I according to my uſual cuſtom written out at large ſoon after the time, much might have been preſerved, which is now irretrievably loſt. I can now only record ſome particular ſcenes, and a few fragments of his <hi>memorabilia.</hi> But to make ſome amends for my relaxation of diligence in one reſpect, I have to preſent my readers with arguments upon two law caſes, with which he favoured me.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, the ſixth of May, we dined by ourſelves at the Mitre, and he dictated to me what follows, to obviate the complaint already mentioned <note n="2" place="bottom">Page 443.</note>, which had been made in the form of an action in the Court of Seſſion, by Dr. Memis, of Aberdeen, that in the ſame tranſlation of a charter in which <hi>phyſicians</hi> were mentioned, he was called <hi>Doctor of Medicine.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>THERE are but two reaſons for which a phyſician can decline the title of <hi>Doctor of Medicine,</hi> becauſe he ſuppoſes himſelf diſgraced by the doctorſhip, or ſuppoſes the doctorſhip diſgraced by himſelf. To be diſgraced by a title which he ſhares in common with every illuſtrious name of his profeſſion, with Boerhaave, with Arbuthnot, and with Cullen, can ſurely diminiſh no man's reputation. It is, I ſuppoſe, to the doctorate, from which he ſhrinks, that he owes his right of practiſing phyſick. A Doctor of Medicine is a phyſician under the protection of the laws, and by the ſtamp of authority. The phyſician who is not a Doctor, uſurps a profeſſion, and is authoriſed only by himſelf to decide upon health and ſickneſs, and life and death. That this gentleman is a Doctor, his diploma makes evident; a diploma not obtruded upon him, but obtained by ſolicitation, and for which fees were paid. With what countenance any man can refuſe the title which he has either begged or bought, is not eaſily diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>All verbal injury muſt compriſe in it either ſome falſe poſition, or ſome unneceſſary declaration of defamatory truth. That in calling him Doctor, a falſe appellation was given him, he himſelf will not pretend, who at the ſame time that he complains of the title, would be offended if we ſuppoſed him to
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:0548300101:523"/>
 be not a Doctor. If the title of Doctor be a defamatory truth, it is time to diſſolve our colleges, for why ſhould the publick give ſalaries to men whoſe approbation is reproach? It may likewiſe deſerve the notice of the publick to conſider what help can be given to the profeſſors of phyſick, who all ſhare with this unhappy gentleman the ignominious appellation, and of whom the very boys in the ſtreet are not afraid to ſay, <hi>There goes the Doctor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is implied by the term Doctor is well known. It diſtinguiſhes him to whom it is granted, as a man who has attained ſuch knowledge of his profeſſion as qualifies him to inſtruct others. A Doctor of Laws is a man who can form lawyers by his precepts. A Doctor of Medicine is a man who can teach the art of curing diſeaſes. There is an old axiom which no man has yet thought fit to deny, <hi>Nil dat quod non habet.</hi> Upon this principle to be a Doctor implies ſkill, for <hi>nemo docet quod non didicit.</hi> In England, whoever practiſes phyſick, not being a Doctor, muſt practice by a licence: but the doctorate conveys a licence in itſelf.</p>
                  <p>By what accident it happened that he and the other phyſicians were mentioned in different terms, where the terms themſelves were equivalent, or where in effect that which was applied to him was the more honourable, perhaps they who wrote the paper cannot now remember. Had they expected a lawſuit to have been the conſequence of ſuch petty variation, I hope they would have avoided it <note n="3" place="bottom">In juſtice to Dr. Memis, though I was againſt him as an Advocate, I muſt mention, that he objected to the variation very earneſtly, before the tranſlation was printed off.</note>. But, probably, as they meant no ill, they ſuſpected no danger, and, therefore, conſulted only what appeared to them propriety or convenience.</p>
               </q>
               <p>A few days afterwards I conſulted him upon a cauſe, <hi>Paterſon and others</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander and others,</hi> which had been decided by a caſting vote in the Court of Seſſion, determining that the Corporation of Stirling was corrupt, and ſetting aſide the election of ſome of their officers, becauſe it was proved that three of the leading men who influenced the majority, had entered into an unjuſtifiable compact, of which, however, the majority were ignorant. He dictated to me, after a little conſideration, the following ſentences upon the ſubject:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"THERE is a difference between majority and ſuperiority; majority is applied to number, and ſuperiority to power; and power like many other things, is to be eſtimated <hi>non numero ſed pondere.</hi> Now though the greater <hi>number</hi> is not corrupt, the greater <hi>weight</hi> is corrupt, ſo that corruption
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0548300101:524"/>
predominates in the borough, taken <hi>collectively,</hi> though, perhaps, taken  <hi>numerically,</hi> the greater part may be uncorrupt. That borough which is ſo conſtituted as to act corruptly, is in the eye of reaſon corrupt, whether it be by the uncontroulable power of a few, or by an accidental pravity of the multitude. The objection, in which is urged the injuſtice of making the innocent ſuffer with the guilty, is an objection not only againſt ſociety, but againſt the poſſibility of ſociety. All ſocieties, great and ſmall, ſubſiſt upon this condition; that as the individuals derive advantages from union, they may likewiſe ſuffer inconveniences; that as thoſe who do nothing and ſometimes thoſe who do ill, will have the honours and emoluments of general virtue and general proſperity, ſo thoſe likewiſe who do nothing or perhaps do well, muſt be involved in the conſequences of predominant corruption."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This in my opinion was a very nice caſe; but the deciſion was affirmed in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
               <p>On Monday, May 8, we went together and viſited the manſions of Bedlam. I had been informed that he had once been there before with Mr. Wedderburne, (now Lord Loughborough,) Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Foote; and I had heard Foote give a very entertaining account of Johnſon's happening to have his attention arreſted by a man who was very furious, and who, while beating his ſtraw, ſuppoſed it to be William Duke of Cumberland, whom he was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his cruelties in Scotland in 1746. There was nothing peculiarly remarkable this day; but the general contemplation of inſanity was very affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I accompanied him home, and dined and drank tea with him.</p>
               <p>Talking of an acquaintance of ours, diſtinguiſhed for knowing an uncommon variety of miſcellaneous articles both in antiquities and polite literature, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"You know, Sir, he runs about with little weight upon his mind."</q> And talking of another very ingenious gentleman, who from the warmth of his temper was at variance with many of his acquaintance, and wiſhed to avoid them, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he leads the life of an outlaw."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, May 12, as he had been ſo good as to aſſign me a room in his houſe, where I might ſleep occaſionally, when I happened to ſit with him to a late hour, I took poſſeſſion of it this night, ſound every thing in excellent order, and was attended by honeſt Francis with a moſt civil aſſiduity. I aſked him whether I might go to a conſultation with another lawyer upon Sunday, as that appeared to me to be doing work as much in my way, as if an artiſan ſhould work on the day appropriated for religious reſt. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, when you are of conſequence enough to oppoſe the practice of conſulting upon Sunday, you ſhould do it: but you may go
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0548300101:525"/>
 now. It is not criminal, though it is not what one ſhould do, who is anxious for the preſervation and increaſe of piety, to which a peculiar obſervance of Sunday is a great help. The diſtinction is clear between what is of moral and what is of ritual obligation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, May 13, I breakfaſted with him by invitation, accompanied by Mr. Andrew Croſbie, a Scotch Advocate, whom he had ſeen at Edinburgh, and the Hon. Colonel (now General) Edward Stopford, brother to Lord Courtown, who was deſirous of being introduced to him. His tea and rolls and butter, and whole breakfaſt apparatus were all in ſuch decorum, and his behaviour was ſo courteous, that Colonel Stopford was quite ſurprized, and wondered at his having heard ſo much ſaid of Johnſon's ſlovenlineſs and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have preſerved nothing of what paſſed, except that Croſbie pleaſed him much by talking learnedly of alchymy, as to which Johnſon was not a poſitive unbeliever, but rather delighted in conſidering what progreſs had actually been made in the tranſmutation of metals, what near approaches there had been to the making of gold; and told us that it was affirmed, that a perſon in the Ruſſian dominions had diſcovered the ſecret, but died without revealing it, as imagining it would be prejudicial to ſociety. He added, that it was not impoſſible but it might in time be generally known.</p>
               <p>It being aſked whether it was reaſonable for a man to be angry at another whom a woman had preferred to him;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not ſee, Sir, that it is reaſonable for a man to be angry at another, whom a woman has preferred to him: but angry he is, no doubt; and he is loath to be angry at himſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before ſetting out for Scotland on the 23d, I was frequently in his company at different places, but during this period have recorded only two remarks: one concerning Garrick: <q rend="inline">"He has not Latin enough. He finds out the Latin by the meaning, rather than the meaning by the Latin."</q> And another concerning writers of travels, who, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"were more defective than any other writers."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I paſſed many hours with him on the 17th, of which I find all my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial is, <q rend="inline">"much laughing."</q> It would ſeem he had that day been in a humour for jocularity and merriment, and upon ſuch occaſions I never knew a man laugh more heartily. We may ſuppoſe, that the high reliſh of a ſtate ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from his habitual gloom, produced more than ordinary exertions of that diſtinguiſhing faculty of man, which has puzzled philoſophers ſo much to explain. Johnſon's laugh was as remarkable as any circumſtance in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It was a kind of good humoured growl. Tom Davies deſcribed it drolly enough: <q rend="inline">"He laughs like a rhinoceros."</q>

                     <p>Mrs. Thrale has taken cold, and been very much diſordered, but I hope is grown well. Mr. Langton went yeſterday to Lincolnſhire, and has invited Nicolaida<note n="4" place="bottom">A learned Greek.</note> to follow him. Beauclerk talks of going to Bath.

                        <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I AM now returned from the annual ramble into the middle counties. Having ſeen nothing that I had not ſeen before, I have nothing to relate. Time has left that part of the iſland few antiquities; and commerce has left the people no ſingularities. I was glad to go abroad, and, perhaps, glad to come home; which is, in other words, I was, I am afraid, weary of being at home, and weary of being abroad. Is not this the ſtate of life? But, if we confeſs this wearineſs, let us not lament it; for all the wiſe and all the good ſay, that we may cure it.</p>
                     <p>For the black fumes which riſe in your mind, I can preſcribe nothing but that you diſperſe them by honeſt buſineſs or innocent pleaſure, and by reading ſometimes eaſy and ſometimes ſerious. Change of place is uſeful; and I hope that your reſidence at Auchinleck will have many good effects. * * * * * *.</p>
                     <p>That I ſhould have given pain to Raſay, I am ſincerely ſorry; and am therefore very much pleaſed that he is no longer uneaſy. He ſtill thinks that I have repreſented him as perſonally giving up the Chieftainſhip. I meant only that it was no longe rconteſted between the two houſes, and ſuppoſed it
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:0548300101:528" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſettled, perhaps, by the ceſſion of ſome remote generation, in the houſe of  Dunvegan. I am ſorry the advertiſement was not continued for three or four times in the papers.</p>
                     <p>That Lord Monboddo and Mr. Macqueen ſhould controvert a poſition contrary to the imaginary intereſt of literary or national prejudice, might be eaſily imagined; but of a ſtanding fact there ought to be no controverſy: If there are men with tails, catch an <hi>homo caudatus;</hi> if there was writing of old in the Highlands or Hebrides, in the Erſe language, produce the manuſcripts. Where men write, they will write to one another, and ſome of their letters, in families ſtudious of their anceſtry, will be kept. In Wales there are many manuſcripts.</p>
                     <p>I have now three parcels of Lord Hailes's hiſtory, which I purpoſe to return all the next week: that his reſpect for my little obſervations ſhould keep his work in ſuſpenſe, makes one of the evils of my journey. It is in our language, I think, a new mode of hiſtory, which tells all that is wanted, and, I ſuppoſe, all that is known, without laboured ſplendour of language, or affected ſubtilty of conjecture. The exactneſs of his dates raiſes my wonder. He ſeems to have the cloſeneſs of Henault without his conſtraint.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Thrale was ſo entertained with your 'Journal',' that ſhe almoſt read herſelf blind. She has a great regard for you.</p>
                     <p>Of Mrs. Boſwell, though ſhe knows in her heart that ſhe does not love me, I am always glad to hear any good, and hope that ſhe and the little dear ladies will have neither ſickneſs nor any other affliction. But ſhe knows that ſhe does not care what becomes of me, and for that ſhe may be ſure that I think her very much to blame.</p>
                     <p>Never, my dear Sir, do you take it into your head to think that I do not love you; you may ſettle yourſelf in full confidence both of my love and my eſteem; I love you as a kind man, I value you as a worthy man, and hope in time to reverence you as a man of exemplary piety.

                     <p>THIS week I came home from Paris. I have brought you a little box, which I thought pretty; but I know not whether it is properly a ſnuff-box, or a box for ſome other uſe. I will ſend it, when I can find an opportunity. I have been through the whole journey remarkably well. My fellow-travellers were the ſame whom you ſaw at Lichfield, only we took Baretti with us. Paris is not ſo fine a place as you would expect. The palaces and churches, however, are very ſplendid and magnificent; and what would pleaſe you, there are many very fine pictures; but I do not think their way of life commodious or pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>Let me know how your health has been all this while. I hope the fine ſummer has given you ſtrength ſufficient to encounter the winter.</p>
                     <p>Make my compliments to all my friends; and, if your fingers will let you, write to me, or let your maid write, if it be troubleſome to you. I am,</p>

               <p>It is to be regretted, that he did not write an account of his travels in France; for as he is reported to have once ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"he could write the Life of a Broomſtick,"</q> ſo, notwithſtanding ſo many former travellers have exhauſted almoſt every thing ſubject for remark in that great kingdom, his very accurate obſervation, and peculiar vigour of thought and illuſtration, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a valuable work. During his viſit to it, which laſted but about two months, he wrote notes or minutes of what he ſaw. He promiſed to ſhew me them, but I neglected to put him in mind of it; and the greateſt part of them have been loſt, or, perhaps, deſtroyed in that precipitate burning of his papers a few days before his death, which muſt ever be lamented: One ſmall paper-book, however, entitled <q rend="inline">"FRANCE, II."</q> has been preſerved, and is in my poſſeſſion. It is a diurnal regiſter of his life and obſervations, from the 10th of October to the 4th of November, incluſive, being twenty-ſix days; and ſhews an extraordinary attention to various minute particulars. Being the only memorial of this tour that remains, my readers, I am confident, will peruſe it with pleaſure, though his notes are very ſhort, and evidently written only to aſſiſt his own recollection.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Oct. 10. Tueſday. We ſaw the <hi>Ecole Militaire,</hi> in which one hundred and fifty young boys are educated for the army. They have arms of different

 ſizes, according to the age;—flints of wood. The building is very large, but nothing fine, except the council-room. The French have large ſquares in the windows;—they make good iron paliſades. Their meals are groſs.</p>
                  <p>We viſited the Obſervatory, a large building of a great height. The upper ſtones of the parapet very large; but not cramped with iron. The flat on the top is very extenſive; but on the inſulated part there is no parapet. Though it was broad enough, I did not care to go upon it. Maps were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of the rooms.</p>
                  <p>We walked to a ſmall convent of the Fathers of the Oratory. In the reading-deſk of the refectory lay the Lives of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Oct. 11. Wedneſday. We went to ſee <hi>Hôtel de Chatlois,</hi> a houſe not very large, but very elegant. One of the rooms was gilt to a degree that I never ſaw before. The upper part for ſervants and their maſters was pretty.</p>
                  <p>Thence we went to Mr. Monville's, a houſe divided into ſmall apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, furniſhed with effeminate and minute elegance.—Porphyry.</p>
                  <p>Thence we went to St. Roque's church, which is very large;—the lower part of the pillars incruſted with marble.—Three chapels behind the high altar;—the laſt a maſs of low arches.—Altars, I believe, all round.</p>
                  <p>We paſſed through <hi>Place de Vendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me,</hi> a fine ſquare, about as big as Hanover-ſquare.—Inhabited by the high families.—Lewis XIV. on horſeback in the middle.</p>
                  <p>Monville is the ſon of a farmer-general. In the houſe of Chatlois is a room furniſhed with japan, fitted up in Europe.</p>
                  <p>We dined with Boccage, the Marquis Blanchetti, and his lady.—The ſweetmeats taken by the Marchioneſs Blanchetti, after obſerving that they were dear.—Mr. Le Roy, Count Manucci the Abbé, the Prior, and Father Wilſon, who ſtaid with me, till I took him home in the coach.</p>
                  <p>Bathiani is gone.</p>
                  <p>The French have no laws for the maintenance of their poor.—Monk not neceſſarily a prieſt.—Benedictines riſe at four;—are at church an hour and half; at church again half an hour before, half an hour after dinner; and again from half an hour after ſeven to eight. They may ſleep eight hours.—Bodily labour wanted in monaſteries.</p>

                  <p>Oct. 12. Thurſday. We went to the Gobelins.—Tapeſtry makes a good picture;—imitates fleſh exactly.—One piece with a gold ground;—the birds not exactly coloured.—Thence we went to the King's cabinet;—very neat,

Cygnets dark; their black feet; on the ground; tame.—Halcyons, or gulls.—Stag and hind, young.—Aviary, very large: the net, wire.—Black ſtag of China, ſmall.—Rhinoceros, the horn broken and pared away, which, I ſuppoſe, will grow; the baſis, I think, four inches croſs; the ſkin folds like looſe cloth doubled over his body, and croſs his hips; a vaſt animal though young; as big, perhaps, as four oxen.—The young elephant, with his tuſks juſt appearing.—The brown bear put out his paws;—all very tame.—The lion.—The tigers I did not well view.—The camel, or dromedary with two bunches, called the Huguin <note n="2" place="bottom">This epithet ſhould be applied to this animal with one bunch.</note>, taller than any horſe.—Two camels with one bunch.—Among the birds was a pelican, who being let out, went to a fountain, and ſwam about to catch fiſh.

                  <p>Oct. 23. Monday. Laſt night I wrote to Levet.—We went to ſee the looking-glaſſes wrought. They come from Normandy in caſt plates, perhaps the third of an inch thick. At Paris they are ground upon a marble table, by rubbing one plate on another with grit between them. The various ſands, of which there are ſaid to be five, I could not learn. The handle, by which the upper glaſs is moved, has the form of a wheel, which may be moved in all directions. The plates are ſent up with their ſurfaces ground, but not poliſhed, and ſo continue till they are beſpoken, leſt time ſhould ſpoil the ſurface, as we were told. Thoſe that are to be poliſhed, are laid on a table covered with ſeveral thick cloths, hard ſtrained, that the reſiſtance may be equal; they are then rubbed with a hand rubber, held down hard by a contrivance which I did not well underſtand. The powder which is uſed laſt ſeemed to me to be iron diſſolved in aqua fortis: they called it, as Baretti ſaid, <hi>marc de l'eau forte,</hi> which he thought was dregs. They mentioned vitriol and ſaltpetre. The cannon ball ſwam in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver. To ſilver them, a leaf of beaten tin is laid, and rubbed with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, to which it unites. Then more quickſilver is poured upon it, which, by its mutual [attraction] riſes very high. Then a paper is laid at the neareſt end of the plate, over which the glaſs is ſlided till it lies upon the plate, having driven much of the quickſilver before it. It is then, I think, preſſed upon cloths, and then ſet ſloping to drop the ſuperfluous mercury; the ſlope is daily heigthened towards a perpendicular.</p>
                  <p>In the way I ſaw the Grêve, the mayor's houſe, and the Baſtile.</p>
                  <p>We then went to Sans-terre, a brewer. He brews with about as much malt as Mr. Thrale, and ſells his beer at the ſame price, though he pays no duty for malt, and little more than half as much for beer. Beer is ſold retail at 6d. a bottle. He brews 4,000 barrels a year. There are ſeventeen brewers in Paris, of whom none is ſuppoſed to brew more than he:—reckoning them at 3,000 each, they make 51,000 a year.—They make their malt, for malting is here no trade.</p>
                  <p>The moat of the Baſtile is dry.</p>

Whether he wrote any more after this time, I know not; but probably not much, as he arrived in England about the 12th of November. Theſe ſhort notes of his tour, though they may ſeem minute taken ſingly, make together a conſiderable maſs of information, and exhibit ſuch an ardour of enquiry and acuteneſs of examination, as, I believe, are found in but few travellers, eſpecially at an advanced age. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely refute the idle notion which has been propagated, <hi>that he could not ſee;</hi> and, if he had taken the trouble to reviſe and digeſt them, he undoubtedly could have expanded them into a very entertaining narrative.</p>
               <p>When I met him in London the following year, the account which he gave me of his French tour, was, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have ſeen all the viſibilities of Paris, and around it; but to have formed an acquaintance with the people there, would have required more time than I could ſtay. I was juſt beginning to creep into acquaintance by means of Colonel Drumgould, a very high man, Sir, head of <hi>L'Ecole Militaire,</hi> a moſt complete character, for he had firſt been a profeſſor of rhetorick, and then became a ſoldier. And, Sir, I was very kindly treated by the Engliſh Benedictines, and have a cell appropriated to me in their convent."</q>

 He obſerved, <q rend="inline">"The great in France live very magnificently, but the reſt very miſerably. There is no happy middle ſtate as in England. The ſhops of Paris are mean; the meat in the markets is ſuch as would be ſent to a gaol in England: and Mr. Thrale juſtly obſerved, that the cookery of the French was forced upon them by neceſſity; for they could not eat their meat, unleſs they added ſome taſte to it. The French are an indelicate people; they will ſpit upon any place. At Madame—'s, a literary lady of rank, the footman took the ſugar in his fingers, and threw it into my coffee. I was going to put it aſide; but hearing it was made on purpoſe for me, I e'en taſted Tom's fingers. The ſame lady would needs make tea <hi>á l' Angloiſe.</hi> The ſpout of the tea-pot did not pour freely: ſhe bade the footman blow into it. France is worſe than Scotland in every thing but climate. Nature has done more for the French; but they have done leſs for themſelves than the Scotch have done."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It happened that Foote was at Paris at the ſame time with Dr. Johnſon, and his deſcription of my friend while there was abundantly ludicrous. He told me, that the French were quite aſtoniſhed at his figure and manner, and at his dreſs, which he obſtinately continued exactly as in London;—his brown clothes, black ſtockings, and plain ſhirt. He mentioned, that an Iriſh gentleman ſaid to Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have not ſeen the beſt French players."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Players, Sir! I look on them as no better than creatures ſet upon tables and joint-ſtools to make faces and produce laughter, like dancing dogs."</q>—<q rend="inline">"But, Sir, you will allow that ſome players are better than others?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, as ſome dogs dance better than others."</q>
               </p>
               <p>While Johnſon was in France, he was generally very reſolute in ſpeaking Latin. It was a maxim with him that a man ſhould not let himſelf down, by ſpeaking a language which he ſpeaks imperfectly. Indeed, we muſt have often obſerved how inſeriour, how much like a child a man appears, who ſpeaks a broken tongue. When Sir Joſhua Reynolds, at one of the dinners of the Royal Academy, preſented him to a Frenchman of great diſtinction, he would not deign to ſpeak French, but talked Latin, though his Excellency did not underſtand it, owing, perhaps, to Johnſon's Engliſh pronunciation: yet upon another occaſion he was obſerved to ſpeak French to a Frenchman of high rank, who ſpoke Engliſh; and being aſked the reaſon, with ſome expreſſion of ſurprize,—he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Becauſe I think my French is as good as his Engliſh."</q> Though Johnſon underſtood French perfectly, he could not ſpeak it readily, as I have obſerved at his firſt interview with General Paoli, in 1769; yet he wrote it, I imagine, very well, as appears from ſome of his letters in Mrs. Piozzi's collection, of which I ſhall tranſcribe one.</p>

               <p>Here let me not forget a curious anecdote, as related to me by Mr. Beauclerk, which I ſhall endeavour to exhibit as well as I can in that gentleman's lively manner; and in juſtice to him it is proper to add, that Dr. Johnſon told me, I might rely both on the correctneſs of his memory, and the fidelity of his narrative. <q rend="inline">"When Madame de Boufflers was firſt in England, (ſaid Beauclerk,) ſhe was deſirous to ſee Johnſon. I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the Temple, where ſhe was entertained with his converſation for ſome time. When our viſit was over, ſhe and I left him, and were got into Inner Temple-lane, when all at once I heard a noiſe like thunder. This was occaſioned by Johnſon, who it ſeems upon a little recollection, had taken it into his head that he ought to have done the honours of his literary reſidence to a foreign lady of quality, and eager to ſhew himſelf a man of gallantry, was hurrying down the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe in violent agitation. He overtook us before we reached the Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and bruſhing in between me and Madame de Boufſiers, ſeiſed her hand, and conducted her to her coach. His dreſs was a ruſty brown morning ſuit, a pair of old ſhoes by way of ſlippers, a little ſhrivelled wig ſticking on the top of his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He ſpoke Latin with wonderful fluency and elegance. When Pere Boſcovich was in England, Johnſon dined in company with him at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, and at Dr. Douglas's, now Biſhop of Carliſle. Upon both occaſions that celebrated foreigner expreſſed his aſtoniſhment at Johnſon's Latin converſation.</p>

               <p>Mr. Maclean returned with the moſt agreeable accounts of the polite attention with which he was received by Dr. Johnſon.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this year Dr. Burney informs me, that <q rend="inline">"he very frequently met Dr. Johnſon at Mr. Thrale's, at Streatham, where they had many long converſations, often ſitting up as long as the fire and candles laſted, and much longer than the patience of the ſervants ſubſiſted."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A few of Johnſon's ſayings, which that gentleman recollects, ſhall here be inſerted.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I never take a nap after dinner but when I have had a bad night, and then the nap takes me."</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"There is now leſs flogging in our great ſchools than formerly, but then leſs is learned there; ſo that what the boys get at one end, they loſe at the other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"More is learned in publick than in private ſchools, from emulation; there is the colliſion of mind with mind, or the radiation of many minds pointing to one center. Though few boys make their own exerciſes, yet if a good exerciſe is given up, out of a great number of boys, it is made by ſomebody."</q>

She tells the children, 'This is a cat, and that is a dog, with four legs and a tail; ſee there! you are much better than a cat or a dog, for you can ſpeak.' If I had beſtowed ſuch an education on a daughter, and had diſcovered that ſhe thought of marrying ſuch a fellow, I would have ſent her to the <hi>Congreſs."</hi>

               <p>After having talked ſlightingly of muſick, he was obſerved to liſten very attentively while Miſs Thrale played on the harpſichord, and with eagerneſs he called to her, <q rend="inline">"Why don't you daſh away like Burney?"</q> Dr. Burney upon this ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir, we ſhall make a muſician of you at laſt."</q> Johnſon with candid complacency replied, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I ſhall be glad to have a new ſenſe given to me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had come down one morning to the breakfaſt-room, and been a conſiderable time by himſelf before any body appeared. When on a ſubſequent day, he was twitted by Mrs. Thrale for being very late, which he generally was, he defended himſelf by alluding to the extraordinary morning, when he had been too early, <q rend="inline">"Madam, I do not like to come down to <hi>vacuity."</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Not having heard from him for a longer time than I ſuppoſed he would be ſilent, I wrote to him December 18, not in good ſpirits, <q rend="inline">"Sometimes I have been afraid that the cold which has gone over Europe this year like a ſort of peſtilence, has ſciſed you ſeverely; ſometimes my imagination, which is upon occaſions prolifick of evil, hath figured that you may have ſomehow taken offence at ſome part of my conduct."</q>

 However, when ſuch ſuſpicions find their way into your mind, always give them vent, I ſhall make haſte to diſperſe them, but hinder their firſt ingreſs if you can. Conſider ſuch thoughts as morbid.</p>

                     <p>You and your lady will now have no more wrangling about feudal inheritance. How does the young Laird of Auchinleck? I ſuppoſe Miſs Veronica is grown a reader and diſcourſer.</p>
                     <p>I have juſt now got a cough, but it has never yet hindered me from ſleeping: I have had quieter nights than are common with me.</p>
