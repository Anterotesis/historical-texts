            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS there is no medical theory, formed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to enable us to detect what is erroneous or falſe in the accounts of facts, or to direct us in the treatment of new caſes; the following attempt to connect with an important organ many otherwiſe looſe facts, may tend to facilitate the recollection and application of them, and thus abridge the range of inquiry. The number ſuggeſted by this view is ſo great, that there is leſs difficulty in the collection than in the choice; their relation and order, familiar only to one's own habit of aſſociation, may to others at firſt be obſcure; and ſome of them may be diſputed; but the leading ones ſeem to ſhow that the ſtomach is the ſeat of life, diſeaſe, and recovery, and the main organ of a complicated ſyſtem. Many authors, as Vanhelmont, Rega, Bordeu, Lacaze, Barthez, Fouquet, and particularly Mr. Hunter, lean, in their uſeful writings, to the opinion held in this ſummary, which was meant as part of heads of lectures on Materia Medica, read in Edinburgh ſeveral years ago. The farther application of the doctrine to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, will probably appear ſoon.</p>

            <head>Facts tending to ſhow the Connexion of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach with Life, Diſeaſe, and Remedy.</head>
            <p>SUCH ſimply organized animals as have no viſible brain, nerves, lungs, heart, or blood-veſſels, and even vegetables, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and re-act on impreſſions being made on any part of them; and being cut in pieces, each becomes a living individual. They ſeparate the elements of dead matter which re-unite within them in various and ſpecific proportions, and extend their fibres; they propagate their kinds whoſe particles and fibres are arranged into ſpecific forms, as all conſolidated fluids are; they have a preſerving and reſiſting power called vis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatrix and medicatrix naturae; become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged in their functions and ſtructure by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0161901800:5"/>exceſs, defect, or peculiarity of impreſſion; recover from various morbid ſtates; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate loſt ſubſtance; ceaſe at length to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer impreſſions, and ſpontaneouſly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into their elements, which form new combinations in nature.</p>
            <p>In an animal, which, beſides a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the ſeat of the firſt aſſimilation and ſimple life, has nerves and brain, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of ſenſation and thought, the energy of which is encreaſed by a heart and lungs; the aſſimilating, moving, ſentient, and thinking powers become parts of one whole, neceſſary to the action and effect of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, acting as it were in a circle, modify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving the ſyſtem, in which the ſmalleſt puncture producing contractility, pain, and haemorrage, ſeems to ſhew that life, mind, and heart exiſt in every point.</p>
            <p>Cold-blooded animals, whoſe circulation is languid, and reſpiration occaſional, live and move for ſeveral hours without brain,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0161901800:6"/>heart, or lungs: the heart of a young hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blooded animal continues its motions for ſome time after its connexion with the brain is cut off<note n="*" place="bottom">Whytt.</note>; in phthiſis pulmonalis there is ſometimes ſcarcely a veſtige of lungs left; ſome perſons have the power of ſuſpending the action of the heart<note n="†" place="bottom">Gregory.</note>, and it is ſometimes ſuſpended without the will, while the other functions continue entire<note n="†" place="bottom">Hunter.</note>.</p>
            <p>After decollation, it is ſaid, a viper tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed ſeveral walks in a garden; an oſtrich continued running in a circular courſe leading to an accuſtomed place of refuge; and a cock impulſively continued its motion towards ſome grain that had been juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it; a turtle, whoſe ſtrength, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering its maſſy ſhell, muſt be very great, lives for months without the head<note n="§" place="bottom">Redi.</note>: foetuſes have been born alive without brain, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum, or ſpinal marrow. In dropſy of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0161901800:7"/>head, nothing has been found but the membranes; ſome have loſt a conſiderable part of the brain and recovered; all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary motions, and even the uſe of the limbs, have continued a day or two after the ſpinal marrow has been divided<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſſault.</note>; the involuntary ones continue when the ſenſes and brain are locked up in ſleep, lethargy, and apoplexy, and in the ſuſpended action of the heart and lungs in ſyncope. In mania the vigour is often increaſed and the ſenſibility diminiſhed, while the contrary is generally obſerved in indigeſtion, gout, and nervous diſeaſes, in which the intellect is often unimpaired. The contractility laſts much longer if an animal be killed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying its brain than otherwiſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Blane.</note>; death, occaſioned by over-exertion of the muſcles, by the electric, carbonic, or azotic fluids, or by the poiſon of a viper, prevents the muſcles
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0161901800:8"/>from becoming rigid, and diſpoſes to a much quicker putrefaction; and the life in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, particularly in their ſeeds, in a chick before incubation, and in the hibernating animals, as in the ſwallow, mountain-rat, and dormouſe, reſiſts the tendency to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and freezing. The brain of a man, in proportion to the weight of his body, is above thirty times heavier than that of a large quadruped, and ſtill more ſo than that of an amphibious one, as the crocodile, with proportionably leſs ſtrength. The brain has a ſmall proportion likewiſe, in long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked birds, fiſhes, and inſects; and is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly large in ſome ſmall animals, as ſmall birds and rats. In the lower animals it is in general ſpent in nerves on the ſenſes, face, and jaws, as the ſpinal marrow is in thoſe on the trunk which are large in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and in all animals the axillary and ſciatic nerves and blood-veſſels, as neceſſary to ſtrong voluntary motion, are the largeſt.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0161901800:9"/>
            <p>The pulp of the brain and nerves has very little contractility. Parts of animals live and grow without nerves; a limb, after its nerve is cut, though it loſes its power of voluntary motion and ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, after ſome time, begins to waſte, yet does not putrefy, but retains its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractility, temperature, and circulation; and a wound or fracture in this caſe heals, though the nerve be not regenerated<note n="*" place="bottom">Monro.</note>. A muſcle, as the heart, whoſe nerves bear no proportion to its bulk and action, cut off, retains its contractility. Palſied limbs void of ſenſe or motion, or of both, are ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely contractile, inflame, ſuppurate, and heal, as in the caſe of a bliſter, which does not ſo readily happen in a moribund patient; and an obſtinate ulcer in the affected ſide has been known to heal quickly on the attack of hemiplegia.</p>
            <p>No animal can exiſt without a ſtomach; life has remained even in the perfect ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0161901800:10"/>independently of almoſt every other organ; the ſtomach is the only organ which, as in the zoophytes, the hydatid, the oyſter, the polypus, and ſome other vermes, can be ſaid to exiſt as an animal by itſelf; theſe animals are capable of every muſcular motion, and of every living power ſuited to their mode of exiſtence and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their kind. Placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, the ſtomach is felt to be the centre of every impreſſion on any part of the body or the mind, and the ſeat of muſcular exertion and fatigue. A blow, or the wind of a cannon-ball over the ſtomach, kills with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving any mark<note n="*" place="bottom">Blane.</note>; if any of its nerves be cut or itſelf wounded, the aliment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unchanged; when healthy it reſiſts, arreſts, and reverſes the ſtages of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſweetens putrid meat, does not ſuffer from the ſyphilitic, variolous, viperine or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0161901800:11"/>carbonic poiſons, which injure only the bare ſurface or paſſages to the noſe and lungs. It is the receptacle of food, poiſon, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, the effects of which on itſelf are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to every other part; it is moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to diſorder, moſt acceſſible to remedy, regulating, and regulated by, the motions and ſenſations of the whole ſyſtem, and ſo accommodating itſelf as to keep all the parts in balance. Languido ventriculo omnia lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, vegeto vigent. In moſt caſes it is the firſt organ that feels, and the laſt that fails<note n="*" place="bottom">There is generally a diſcharge of faeces after death.</note> Even the ſtate of the mind or character ſeems connected with it, vigorous and ferocious animals being generally carnivorous, with muſcular vigour in proportion to their voracity. It ſeems to be the centre of power and motion from which the vital principle, whatever it be, is determined into the different parts, ſupporting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0161901800:12"/>power in the moving fibres, the thinking power in the brain, ſenſation in the ſentient extremities, aſſimilation in the lymphatic<note n="*" place="bottom">From fiſhes living and growing in diſtilled water and air<note n="†" place="bottom">Fordyce.</note>, from the inſtances of people living ſo long in diſeaſe and in health, without nouriſhment by the mouth, and from the relief of thirſt and even hunger, by the application of water to the ſkin, water and air ſeem to be not only abſorbed and carried, but aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the lymphatics.</note>, ſanguiferous, and glandular veſſels, and the fulneſs in every part of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>When the gaſtric energy is diminiſhed, parts ſeem to loſe their motion and ſenſe as they are diſtant from the ſtomach; as the tips of the noſe and ears, the fingers and toes, and the vaſcular extremities. Like the ſenſes, it has ſpecific ſenſations, as of hunger, thirſt, ſatiety, longing, loathing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0161901800:13"/>ſickneſs, peculiar pain, with a great variety of nameleſs ſtates without ſenſation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with correſponding changes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to prediſpoſition in different parts of the ſyſtem. A grain of a taſteleſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance will affect the ſtomach, and, through it, the other parts, or theſe only, while various acrids, pungent aromatics, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, can often be taken in large quantity, without producing any remarkable effect whatever. Stones of conſiderable ſize have been ſwallowed, and the ſtomach itſelf, though, from its organic contractility, it is always full, can be in very different ſtates of diſtenſion and contraction, with even morbid tumor, without much inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Leidenfroſt mentions a caſe, in which the application of warm wine to the villous coat of a wounded inteſtine excited great motion without any pain, even on rubbing off the mucus ſo as to bring blood. There is often little or no pain felt in the action of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0161901800:14"/>violent vomiting or purging, ſo that living motion does not, even in the perfect ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, imply ſenſibility.</p>
            <p>The alimentary canal, which, on open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a living animal, hardly ſeems to move, ſhows, as ſoon as the other parts die, ſtrongly increaſed motions, which, like the contractility mentioned above, continue for hours<note n="*" place="bottom">Caldani and Fontana.</note>. In the caſe of violent death, as that of beheading, the ſame increaſed motions, after ſome ſhort ſpace, with an impetuous ſpring of blood from the veſſels, are remarkable; which motions may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, independently of the gaſtric liquor, ſometimes occaſion thoſe perforations in the ſtomach obſerved in ſuch caſes, particularly in infants even after natural death; and to ſome ſimilar ſtate of bowel may be referred the<note n="†" place="bottom">In Scotland this is called earth or yerd-hunger.</note> eſuries and priapiſmus moribundorum. This reſiſting or reacting power or vis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatrix and medicatrix, in which the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0161901800:15"/>power of recovery ſeems to reſide, is evident in the caſe of other impreſſions on the ſtomach, the ſurface, and the mind, as in the action of an emetic, the glow from the cold bath, and the red ſuffuſion produced by paſſion; and it is this which ſeems chiefly to enable a healthy animal to bear changes and extremes of the ordinary ones, as thoſe of temperature, air, food and drink, motion, ſenſation, and thought, in a remarkable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The powers acting on the ſyſtem, as heat, air, exerciſe of body and mind, diet, poiſon, medicine, and the fluids, tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the power of the ſtomach, but ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, or in exceſs, to deſtroy it; and are called ſtimulants. When defective they tend to diminiſh it, and are called ſedative, which effect, if of a certain degree, is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the reaction or reſiſtance; and they are then called indirect ſtimulants. Hence the ſame natural morbid and ſalutary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may, according to their degree, be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0161901800:16"/>ſedative or ſtimulant. Some impreſſions, both internal and external, affect it pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, and, through it, different parts of the ſyſtem. In general, ſtrong impreſſions excite the reſiſting power, weak ones ſeem occaſionally to ſooth, diminiſh, or teaſe it, ſpecific ones produce ſpecific ſtates in it and in different parts of the ſyſtem, and on theſe fits of reſiſtance, ſeem to depend the ſtates of periodical diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The ſtomach is the ſeat of the firſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milating power, in which the elements of food and drink, of whatever kind and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, ſeparate, and then unite into the only one combination fit for undergoing the other ſpecific changes, for making the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific impreſſions, for giving the due diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and repairing the continual waſte; and its ſpontaneous effort or ſtruggle with local injury, ſeems to excite that ſymptomatic fever, or ſtate of veſſel which renders the parts of the blood more ſeparable, forming
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0161901800:17"/>the buffy-coat, the inflammatory exudation, the ſuppuration, and the callus or oſſifying arteries, ſo as to regenerate deſtroyed parts, fill cavities, and form ſkin. On its ſtate ſeems to depend that of the chyle, blood, ſecretions, every ſoft and hard fibre, every organ and function of the ſyſtem, and ſuch is its importance, that it has been emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called the animal, the conſcience of the body, and even ſuppoſed the ſeat of the ſoul<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtotle, Vanhelmont, Mandevelle, Hunter.</note>
            </p>
            <p>During ordinary hunger, its power over the muſcles is diminiſhed, which ſtate is called weakneſs; there is a diminiſhed action of the heart and arteries, particularly at their extremities, as appears from the weak and frequent pulſe, dryneſs, paleneſs, ſhrinking, and lankneſs of the ſurface and features; diminiſhed ſecretion, as appears from the dry mouth and from the flaccid

This eſurient ſtate, like that of other appetites and temporary ſtates of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, goes off, is apt to change into the loathing or ſick ſtate, then returns, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irreſiſtible, enabling the ſtomach to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve leather and other indigeſtible matters; and producing exceſſive thirſt, delirium, and other ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>On the ſight of food, the mouth fills with water; and on taking ſome, the eſurient ſtate with its ſymptoms is removed, the ſtomach feels comfortable, the muſcles and organs, particularly thoſe moſt fatigued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their ſtrength, the circulation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, the ſecretions flow, the reſpiration becomes free, the countenance brightens up, ſerenity and vigour are imparted to body and mind, and the heart opens in benevolence.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0161901800:19"/>During this ſated ſtate the new impreſſion, as if engroſſing the power of the ſtomach, is apt to induce a chillineſs, drowſineſs, heat, full pulſe and perſpiration, the phoenomena of ſlight fever, and in ſome, formidable ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>The effects of food, as of every thing elſe, being relative to the ſtate of the ſtomach, what is light to one is heavy to another; and a cordial in ſome ſtates occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vomiting.

Alcohol, opium, or carbonic acid tends like a meal, to induce ſerenity and vigour of body and mind, but if in exceſs, brings on the ebrious ſtate of ſtomach, which deranges the functions of both. A treſpaſs in eating or drinking, or any thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0161901800:20"/>which from temperament, taſte, or aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ideas, happens to diſagree with the ſtomach, is apt inſtantly to occaſion various ſymptoms<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus a raw cucumber, turnip, or raddiſh, ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of fruits, muſhrooms, bitters, honey, ſpirits, acids, eggs, ſhell-fiſh, abſorbent-earth, nitre, any thing cold when the body is warm, are apt to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indigeſtion, colic, diarrhoea, cholera, hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaſis, hyſteria, gout, palpitation, aſthma, aphonia, ſyncope, apoplexy, palſy, epilepſy, tetanus, haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage, ſuppreſſion of natural diſcharges, dropſy, eruption with fever, to renew and exaſperate a gleet, a ſore, or the pain of a gouty or rheumatic limb.</note>

What ſymptom has not been occaſionally referred to indigeſtion, and what remedy does not fall under the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0161901800:21"/>treatment of it and its effects? What diſeaſe is free from ſome affection of the ſtomach or canal, and what fever does it not mark in its beginning, its progreſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, criſis, and cure? The diſeaſes of children are acknowledged to be moſtly from the ſtomach and bowels, and they are known to be cured of alarming ſymptoms by a puke, a glyſter, or a purge. A perſon feels weak, loſes colour and ſpirits, has head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, giddineſs, and ſhivering, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed ſuffer fits of their diſeaſes, without ſuſpecting, as there is no ſickneſs, want of appetite, coſtiveneſs, or affection of the ſtomach, that they proceed from it, till a natural vomiting or looſeneſs, an emetic or cathartic relieve the complaints. Fits, as of aſthma, chin-cough, hyſteria, and gout, are generally preceded by ſome affection of the canal, and diminiſh or go off by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of air or other matter.</p>
            <p>There does not ſeem to be one ſymptom or combination of ſymptoms, but may be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0161901800:22"/>produced by ſomething taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and, in the caſe of poiſons, its orifices have been found, on diſſection, ſo conſtricted as to have prevented the eſcape of any of the matter.</p>
            <p>The effect of poiſon, like that of food and medicine, is relative to the kind and ſtate of ſtomach. Cows and hares eat hemlock, hares eat milk-thiſtle, hogs fatten on hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, quails on hellebore, and goats on eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium: a horſe can take more glaſs of antimony than would kill an hundred men, a dog more opium than would kill an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed man, while an ordinary doſe of jalap, of nux-vomica, or a few bitter almonds, would convulſe and kill him. Bitter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds kill different kinds of birds likewiſe, and parſley is poiſon to parrots. Indeed every animal and vegetable poiſon is the food of ſome animal, and notwithſtanding this difference of effect, little or no difference of ſtructure in brain, muſcle, membrane, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0161901800:23"/>bone, which form the animal ſolids, can be perceived.</p>
            <p>That the ſtomach may be in a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſtates, appears from the organs of ſenſe being capable of ſuch variety in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſenſation, from cauſes external or internal. Each taſte implies a ſpecific ſtate of organ. Alkaline, acid, ſweet, bitter, aſtringent, acrid, aromatic, and fetid matter excite their reſpective taſtes, which imply ſtates of organ as numerous as the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of theſe claſſes, with their various combinations.</p>
            <p>Some kinds of matter affect different parts of the ſame organ, and the ſenſation is propagated to a greater or leſs diſtance without any probability of abſorption. So an irritation in the lungs is often felt at the epiglottis; in the liver, at the ſhoulder; in the kidney, at the teſticle and thigh; in the bladder, at the end of the glans penis; in the colon, at the navel; in every
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0161901800:24"/>part of the ſyſtem at the ſtomach; and in the ſtomach, at every part of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>An aſtringent, at the tip of the tongue, corrugates the whole mouth, and ſtops ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a remote haemorrhage: a bit of alum diſſolving in the mouth, occaſions a thrill over the body; ſea-ſalt is felt chiefly at the point of the tongue, bitter apple at its middle, elaterium and mezereon at its root, and jalap in the gullet. A diſagreeable taſte, ſmell, ſight, ſound, or touch, the tickling of the throat, or coughing, are apt to occaſion ſickneſs and vomiting. The mere chewing of tobacco or rhubarb, has occaſioned vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and purging. Taſteleſs warm water, an antimonial, or the berries of coriaria myrtifolia, throw the ſtomach into convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Belladonna gives a dryneſs and ſtricture in the fauces; mercury or muriated barytes produces ſalivation; arſenic ſets the teeth on edge, produces gaſtritis, thirſt, black
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0161901800:25"/>tongue, ſubſultus tendinum, and delirium, as in the laſt ſtage of typhus, in which fever the ſtomach, on diſſection, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found morbidly red. A pin, a bit of cork, nutmeg, or other indigeſtible matter in the ſtomach, as if in the lungs, has, till evacuated, occaſioned a continual cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="*" place="bottom">Hildanus, Saunders, Percival.</note>; and an habitual cough is often ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended during a meal or any ſapid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Cicuta produces giddineſs; alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hol, opium, fixed air, lead, and, when the ſtomach is in a particular ſtate, other things produce intoxication.</p>
            <p>Lead produces gaſtrodynia, peculiar colic, with conſtipation, yellow countenance, palſy, chiefly of the ſupinators and extenſors of the fingers, and extenſors of the legs, with heat and pain in the palms and ſoles. Copper occaſions delirium with leprous-like ſpots on the ſurface. Digitalis, after remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0161901800:26"/>diminiſhing the action of the heart and arteries, and promoting abſorption and a flow of urine, has been thrown up ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly intire during the deathful ſickneſs it is apt to occaſion. Cantharides occaſion ſtrangury and priapiſm, and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nervous caſes of the former;<note n="*" place="bottom">Carmichael Smyth.</note> rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dodendron chryſanthemum occaſions deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; ſtramonium occaſions itching, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, eruptions, ſwellings, tremors, fever, and delirium; ſecale cornutum diſeaſed (ergot) produces rhaphania; laurel-water kills every ſpecies of animal, and in the quantity of ſix ounces generally without any previous ſymptom; an ounce or ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a reaction, which occaſions inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, haemorrhage, and convulſions.</p>
            <p>Wepfer mentions a number of patients poiſoned with water-hemlock, and affected with pain at the ſtomach and in the bowels,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0161901800:27"/>grinding of the teeth, hiccup, locked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaw, difficult reſpiration, an aſpect of horror, convulſions, with the abolition of all the ſenſes, haemorrhage from the ears, efforts to vomit, body bent back like a bow, and death; after which the belly and head ſwelled, there was a green foam at the mouth, the orifices of the ſtomach were found quite cloſed, and the blood coagulated, as in every violent death, from an internal cauſe, whereas, from an external one, it remains liquid. In ſome the ſymptoms indicated ludicrous, and in others ſerious turns of mind. In general, the appearance on diſſection of animals killed by theſe or other poiſons, or even by external ones, is redneſs of the ſtomach, with livid or black ſpots in it, in the inteſtines, particularly at the inſertion of the ductus choledochus into the duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum, and in the meſentery. So much do impreſſions on the ſurface affect the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0161901800:28"/>ſtomach, that Bonnet and others have found theſe appearances in animals killed by the bite of the viper; and Fontana mentions dogs and cats recovering from the bite, in proportion to the ſtruggle and violence of vomiting. Tobacco oil applied externally occaſions vomiting; and if the ſurface be bare, it kills. The ſtomach is found red in hydrophobia, and in other caſes connected with affections of that organ. Morgagni and Sproegel could find no redneſs in rats poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by arſenic, or in rabbits that died on taking corroſive ſublimate; nor could the Florentine academicians find any change in the ſolids or fluids of a bull killed by the bite of a viper. Hence poiſons may deſtroy life by diminiſhing the energy of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach beyond the power of reaction.</p>

Strangury is a conſtant ſymptom of gaſtritis; and affections of the urinary organs conſtantly affect the ſtomach. Digitalis, ſquill, tobacco, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0161901800:33"/>moſt other diuretics are apt, like other nauſeants, to be expectorant or ſudorific, and if they be ſo in a conſiderable degree, or if they produce vomiting or purging early, they fail to induce that ſtate of ſtomach which ſeems neceſſary to their diuretic operation. Two ounces of any neutral ſalt is apt to be emetic; an ounce or ſo, even of alum, to be cathartic; two or three drams to be diuretic; a dram to be refrigerant, and, in a warm temperature, ſudorific.</p>

               <p>Impreſſions on the ſenſes affect the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. A diſagreeable taſte, ſmell, ſound, or touch, is apt to occaſion ſickneſs and ſhivering, to ſet the teeth on edge, or to make the mouth water. The ſmell of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſickens and intoxicates<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid that a little in the ſtomach prevents the intoxicating effect of the ſmell.</note>; ſmells agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſome, make others ſíck, faint, and ſuffer abortion; while fetid ones ſometimes recover people from ſickneſs, ſyncope, or hyſteria. Certain motions, as that of a ſwing, ſhip, or carriage; going backwards, turning round, and, in caſes of ill-health, the poſture of ſtanding, or even ſitting, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſickneſs, while that of lying prevents it and ſyncope. Agreeable ſenſations often relieve ſickneſs and promote digeſtion; but in exceſs, injure the ſtomach exceedingly.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0161901800:43"/>
               <p>Emotions are felt at the ſtomach. The modifications of averſion, as fear, anger, ſhame, and grief, inſtantly impair the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt appetite, and are apt to occaſion ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tremors, paleneſs, fluſhings, weeping, various nervous affections, looſeneſs, and jaundice. One is ſick at the thought of anything diſagreeable; and an injury is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough ſaid to ſtick in the ſtomach; which word itſelf in many languages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies anger and other ſtates of mind. The modifications of deſire, as hope, compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and joy, improve the appetite and promote digeſtion and ſtrength. The thought of any thing agreeable does one's heart good; which common phraſe, like that of ſick at heart, refers to the ſtomach, as the word bowels does to the kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Agreeable emotions in exceſs are apt to produce mania and other diſorders, and have been ſuddenly fatal. While the mind is much ſtruck, or fixed, as in thought,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0161901800:44"/>paſſion, affection, or mania, the ſenſibility is diminiſhed to other impreſſions, as that of ſpirits, medicines, contagion, and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and fits of various diſeaſes are thus ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>There is a great analogy between the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſurface, from the mouth to the anus, and the external one<note n="*" place="bottom">Monro, Jackſon.</note>, both being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pervious to fluids by veſſels, quickly regenerating loſt ſubſtance, covered with mucous or ſebaceous matter defending the tender ſurfaces, liable to abraſion, inflammation, thickening, and probably the ſame eruptive and other diſeaſes, the ſtate of the one affecting or alternating with that of the other. Perhaps the growth of hair after death, ſhews ſome continuance of life in the ſkin.</p>
               <p>As a ſtrong doſe, it was obſerved, chiefly affects the ſtomach, ſo a ſtrong
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0161901800:45"/>impreſſion, as pinching, affects chiefly the part; tickling affects the whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, occaſioning itching and laughter, and if continued, weakneſs, ſickneſs, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and convulſions. Gentle pinching and friction are prevailing eaſtern cuſtoms, and exerciſe is univerſally ſo, for promoting digeſtion. A large bleeding ſickens, and ſmall ones are commended in many caſes; compreſſion allays vomiting and colic; a plaſter, by giving ſupport to the muſcles of the back, ſeems ſometimes to ſteady the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and ſyſtem; and the want of uſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as that of a neck-cloth, ſtays, or garters, is apt to produce ſickneſs and other uneaſy feelings.</p>
               <p>Scrophulous-like tumors in the neck have been attributed to compreſſion of the inguinal glands by a truſs; and various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to that of the feet and other parts. Peculiar impreſſions, or ſlight impreſſions in peculiar ſtates, produce peculiar ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0161901800:46"/>A ſcratch produces in ſome, ſwelled glands; in others tetanus<note n="*" place="bottom">This occurs particularly in warm climates, where there is little diſpoſition to inflammation. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a ſtimulant, as turpentine, to the part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing proper inflammation and ſuppuration, has been found to prevent tetanus; and mercury is probably uſeful in it and ſome other caſes, by inducing that ſtate of ſtomach and veſſel which has been called phlogiſtic; in which the parts of the blood are in that ſeparable ſtate, fit for forming a proper ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>, with a ſtate of ſtomach attended with pain, and which has borne fifteen hundred grains of good opium in ſix days, without ſleep, or any affection of the head or mind. An old and obſtinate epilepſy, it is ſaid, has ceaſed to return after the extirpation of a wart from the ſurface. Dentition produces vomiting, purging, eruptions, fever, and convulſions. A tranſplanted tooth has produced appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of ſyphilis or ſcrophula, cured both with and without mercury. A wound
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0161901800:47"/>gradually, according to its ſeat or extent, affects the ſtomach, as appears from the indigeſtion, foul tongue, and fever, inducing, as in pregnancy for the ftus, that ſtate of veſſel neceſſary to form the buffy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, and inſtead of blood, that ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo remarkably under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of diet; and during which the ſtate of ſtomach is ſometimes ſuch, that ſolid meat has ſuddenly produced great weakneſs, with dyſpnaea, delirium, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, ending in death; and the ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or hectic ſtate, if it does not heal, teaſes, waſtes, and deſtroys. In pregnancy the ſtate of ſtomach is peculiar, ſeemingly neceſſary to the retention of the foetus; and may be the cauſe of its reſiſting contagion, and arreſting the ſymptoms of phthiſis. A ſtate of veſſel that teaſes the ſtomach and ſyſtem, is often taken off by a ſpontaneous haemorrhage or inflammation effected by an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0161901800:48"/>effort of the ſtomach, which a bleeding or a bliſter could not allay.</p>
               <p>The elements of food and drink in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chyle, blood, ſecretions, and ſolid parts; and the baſe of vital air uniting with theſe by the lungs, and perhaps by the ſurface, may give the blood its colour, its temperature, its mobility, its coagulability, its power of acting on the left ventricle with thoſe appearances of vitality aſcribed to it by Mr. Hunter; and theſe condenſations going on leſs in a warm temperature, and more in a cold one, may by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating nature of the ſtomach with the other parts, preſerve the equilibrium of heat in the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>That temperature on the ſurface affects the ſtomach, is evident from certain appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of cold exciting vomiting and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from hot applications, or a hot fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thoſe vomitings which occur in fever and the plague; and from changes of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0161901800:49"/>temperature inducing or relieving various diſeaſes, and fits of diſeaſe of which the ſtomach is the feat<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Farquhar mentions a patient, who, ſince the uſe of ice for burns, has continued free for a conſiderable time from hyſterical complaints of long ſtanding.</note>. A warm fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion relieves the ſenſe of heat, handling ſnow occaſions it, an irritation as from a thorn produces it, and an irritation in the ſtomach occaſions alternations of heat and cold. Human heat is between 32° and 156°, the two coagulating points; and the agreeable is, excluſively of habit, between 32° and the human heat. In tropical and polar climates the appetite is keen, and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach reſiſts the power of intoxicating liquors and of contagion. Seeds, eggs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and young animals and maniacs, being, as it were, all ſtomach, bear the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of heat and cold remarkably.</p>
               <p>Certain degrees of heat and cold diſpoſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0161901800:50"/>to ſleep; which, in the caſe of cold, or of external and internal poiſon, ſubduing the power of the ſtomach, is apt to prove fatal. From the long faſting that is borne in ſleep, the ſlow operation of a medicine, and the ſuſpenſion of ſtools, the ſtomach ſeems leſs ſenſible in that ſtate; the temperature is two degrees leſs; and cold is eaſily caught in ſleep. If appetite or ſleep paſs its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, the diſpoſition ceaſes, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is the firſt ſymptom of criſis in fever. Dyſpeptics are apt to ſtart from ſleep or the article of ſleep, and then other nervous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as aſthma, palpitation, epilepſy, and gout, are apt to happen, probably from the change in the ſtate of the ſtomach. It ſeems to be only in occaſional ſtates of ſtomach that fits from fixed cauſes, and other periodical diſeaſes, occur.</p>
               <p>Friction, fomentations, aromatics, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tids, acrids, ſpirits, ammonia, aether, and opium allay vomiting and internal ſpaſms,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0161901800:51"/>prove cathartic, or favour the operation of one. In people with whoſe ſtomachs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, unctuous matter, or eggs diſagree, any application of theſe or of wax to a ſore, has been obſerved likewiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree. Tartite or muriate of antimony ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied externally, as if taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, excite vomiting, purging, and ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Lead, copper, mercury, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, produce vomiting and purging. It is ſaid that bitters expel worms, that opium and tobacco produce ebriety, that bark cures ague, and that opium applied to the bare ſurface has deſtroyed life without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſorbed. Ammonia weakened with oil, ſo as to be applied to the ſurface, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produces nauſea and an univerſal ſweat. Some ſapids ſo applied, ſeem to affect the ſenſe of taſte without reaching it. Arſenic, the bite of a viper, or of a mad-dog, has produced death; and, on diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0161901800:52"/>the ſtomach only has been found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of the tongue and mouth is always attended to as a mark of the ſtate of ſtomach, according to which the ſenſations of taſte are various, and the ſaliva and mucus vary in quantity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, taſte, ſmell, and colour. Hence waterineſs, ptyaliſm, ſalivation, or foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is apt to occur on the ſight of grateful food in indigeſtion, pyroſis, pregnancy, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drophobia, epilepſy, ſcurvy, fever, and ſmall-pox; the firſt ſymptom of which laſt is pain at ſtomach, and the chief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy cold to the ſurface. Lead, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, barytes<note n="*" place="bottom">Crawford.</note>, fox-glove, opium, or the guatimala ſerpent, as well as mercury, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſalivation, which is promoted by a nauſeant or emetic, or by different degrees of temperature. A grain or two of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0161901800:53"/>in the ſtomach, or on the bare ſkin, has had the effect; the ſalivation, like a gleet or mercurial ſore, will ſometimes continue for months; and when ſuddenly ſtopt, is apt to be followed by a violent affection of ſtomach, with vomiting, only to be allayed by mercury<note n="*" place="bottom">Lond. Med. Obſ. &amp; Inq. vol. iii. p. 246.</note>.</p>
               <p>If infection be removed before the ſpecific ſtate of ſtomach and veſſel be induced, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe does not take place; and the morbid ſtate itſelf may, in the caſe of ſyphilis, be removed, for a time at leaſt, by copper, or by a courſe of corroſive ſublimate, or by fever, while the diſpoſition may remain, and break out with or without virulence.</p>
               <p>Such is the ſenſibility of the ſkin as well as ſtomach, that a cold or hot body, or an aſtringent applied to either, is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contraction over all, and ſtop ſome haemorrhages. Fantonus mentions a man
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0161901800:54"/>in a fever, in whom bliſter-iſſues that had dried up, opened and diſcharged anew, after the application of other bliſters to diſtant parts. A plaſter on ſome ſkins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites an eruption in other parts. After a ſuppuration in the fore-arm, a ſwelling has taken place ſucceſſively in the arm-pit, the parotid, the leg, the knee, and the groin. A ſwelled teſticle is allowed to be merely from irritation. A ſucceſſion of tumors takes place in the conglobate glands from the meſentery to the neck, and likewiſe from a compreſſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinal glands; in the inguinal and axillary from irritation at the toes and fingers, with or without infection; and in the neck and behind the ears from a ſcratch, a bliſter, or tinea capitis in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The pain of a wound, burn, or bruiſe, is ſometimes alleviated as pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in another part. Pain, ſpaſm, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0161901800:55"/>and other ſtates are apt to ſhift, as are ulcers, that is peculiar ſtates of veſſſel with peculiar aſſimilation as the ichor of cancer, the cheeſy-like matter of ſcrofula, and the ſtony matter of gout.</p>
               <p>Noxious matter ſeems either rejected by the abſorbents at the ſurface, or aſſimilated before it meet the chyle in the thoracic duct. A mild ſubſtance like milk or mucilage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected into a vein, is apt to throw the ſyſtem into convulſions. The fleſh of an animal killed by a poiſonous bite or arrow, affords wholeſome food; during a courſe of chalybeates no ſuperfluous iron is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in the chyle or blood; bile circulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in jaundice does not produce giddineſs, dimneſs of ſight, &amp;c. as when in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; colouring and odorous particles, as of madder, logwood, turpentine, garlic, or aſparagus, circulate without producing any effect; in ſyphilis the fluids, and even ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary ulcers do not generally infect; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0161901800:56"/>though a mercurial may loſe, and ſulphur acquire oxygen in the ſyſtem, yet it is not alleged that either is found there but in its mild ſtate.</p>
               <p>A morbid ſtate or a fever, attended with inflammation, eruption or ulcer, often takes place ſuddenly, and runs its courſe without any infection, applied or generated, or any cauſe or remedy which acts on the fluids; in the caſe of infection the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as the variolous eruption, ſometimes do not appear, and ſometimes continue to appear when the ſtate or the fever is gone; and are affected by external temperature, while the internal one continues the ſame; ſome very infectious diſeaſes, as the yaws, admit of cure from mere attention to the general health; an infectious irritation, like others, takes time before it affects the reſiſting and aſſimilating power, ſo as to produce the ſpecific ſtate of veſſel and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific matter; during the variolous and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philitic
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0161901800:57"/>ſtate, though there is nothing to prevent abſorption, any new infection ſeems to have no conſtitutional effect; in the caſe of ſmall-pox, yaws, and ſome other infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſyſtem becomes afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible of their action, as it, in ſome meaſure, does of that of accuſtomed ones, as ſpirits, opium, tobacco, and even febrile contagion; and no ſatisfying account is given why the abſorption, multiplication, or aſſimilation, with the other effects of an infectious particle are not more immediate, and in proportion to its quantity, and why after abſorption, it ſhould in any caſe fail to aſſimilate.</p>
               <p>Morbific matter does not ſeem to be a cauſe of gout or of other diſeaſes, called hereditary, as mania, epilepſy, or ſcrofula, which are not infectious, and in which, as in all other caſes, the ſtate of the fluids muſt depend on that of the ſolids. Gout often attacks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſeemingly good health preceded
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0161901800:58"/>perhaps only by ſlight ſymptoms of ſome affection of the alimentary canal, is ſubject to frequent, ſudden, and diſtant tranſlations, affecting the joints with inflammation, but the ſtomach with a ſtate ſo oppoſite, that highly ſtimulating cordials are taken with relief; and no antidote to gouty matter there, whether ſuppoſed acid or otherwiſe acrimonious, was ever thought of.</p>
               <p>The remedies in ſyphilis tend to bring the ſtomach and conſequently the veſſels from their ſyphilitic ſtate, and to keep the functions in a proper condition till the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ceaſe to operate, the morbid ſtate be changed, and the habit overcome. The remedies affect the aſſimilating organs, and except perhaps the corroſive ſublimate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, as appears from the corpulence to which they diſpoſe. Infants have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably aſſimilating and reſiſting powers, ſlaver a great deal, are not eaſily affected by ſyphilis, or eaſily ſalivated by mercury, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0161901800:59"/>are eaſily cured. Mercury, and opium when it ſucceeds, ſeem to put the ſtomach in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſtate, ſomewhat, perhaps, like that of infancy, and the ſalivation does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be from abſorption any more than when it occurs from an emetic, pregnancy, or worms; or than giddineſs is when it ariſes from the uſe of hemlock.</p>
               <p>Inflammation by muſtard, &amp;c. does not excite ſtrangury, as cantharides are apt to do. It often ceaſes the moment the bliſter is removed, the effect of the impreſſion is allayed by a poultice, or the ſtomach is ſoothed by a diluent, or by camphorated oil applied to the ſurface. Cantharides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally relieve paralytic ſtrangury, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence of urine; ſtrangury frequently occurs from affections of the ſtomach, as gaſtritis; and the uva urſi, alkali, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carbonated alkali, whoſe effects ſeem chiefly confined to the ſtomach, occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve even fits of the ſtone.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0161901800:60"/>
               <p>Contagions, whether marſhy, human, or ſpecific, are ſometimes traced to ſmells, as a cadaverous one, a heavy earthy one, that of the confluent ſmall-pox, dyſenteric ſtools; or they may induce the febrile ſtate, the only ſteady character of which is weakneſs, though the impreſſion do not juſt excite the ſtate of ſenſation. It may be in a way ſimilar to what happens in idioſyncraſies in regard to cheeſe, a cat, &amp;c. or that of the inſenſible action of various irritations, as of worms. A gentleman who cannot bear being in a room where there is any cheeſe, though he does not ſee or ſmell it in the leaſt, inſtantly feels a ſenſe of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after ſome time, ſickneſs with a cold ſweat, and faints if he endeavour to brave it. In this way contagion may, through the organ of ſmell, affect the ſtomach and ſyſtem. Inoculated, it produces the ſpecific ſtate, inflammation and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, and in the caſe of ſmall-pox
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0161901800:61"/>without prediſpoſition, the ſtomach does not yield too much, and its energy is kept up by cold on the ſurface, ſo that a ſlight eruption happens ſometimes without fever. Heat on a part ſeems to increaſe the vario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtate of veſſel. Cool air on the ſurface recovers perſons from the ſtate induced by carbonic, azotic, and other noxious airs, the firſt ſymptom of which is vomiting; from ſyncope, and from the ſtill-born ſtate, the firſt exertion from which is ſeen to be about the region of the ſtomach; and the cold ſeems to operate, as in diſcharges of blood, by exciting the ſtomach from its paſſive ſtate. Affections of the ſtomach, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, mark fever in its attack, progreſs, remiſſion, criſis, and cure; all its cauſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſtomach; it has no ſymptom but what an immediate application to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may produce and its evacuation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; and it is often prevented and cured by remedies affecting only that organ.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0161901800:62"/>Its forms of intermittent, remittent, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, yellow, bilious, and dyſenteric, ſeem all related, prevailing at the ſame time, changing their types, and running into one another; and the late obſervations, made in different climates, tend to ſhow that the ſame treatment, properly timed, anſwers equally with them all.</p>
