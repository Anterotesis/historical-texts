            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO', had this comedy failed, which, from it's firſt night's reception, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than probable, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have ſuffered the whole diſgrace, it is not with leſs readineſs, that I ſeize this opportunity, on its better ſucceſs, to acknowledge the obligations which the editor of DOCTOR LAST IN HIS CHARIOT has to Mr. FOOTE.</p>
            <p>I am indebted to you for undertaking a very long part; which, in your circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I conſider as a particular favour: I am indebted to you, for exerting unuſual ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the performance, when there was little hopes of putting the audience in a good humour; and more, (don't be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed when I boaſt of it) I am indebted to you, not only for a whole ſcene, the conſultation of phyſicians in the firſt act, but for ſeveral hints throughout the piece, which had the happieſt effect, tho' ſome of them may, perhaps, have ſuffered by being cloathed in my language.</p>
            <p>I am more particularly acknowledging upon this occaſion, becauſe, in the repeated remarks which the news-papers have
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0058601800:3"/> thought proper to make on your addreſs to the public, the firſt night this thing was acted, they would inſinuate, that you uſed the advantage your ſituation gave you, of a perſonal application to the audience, in order to throw contempt upon the piece while that and it's author were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under your protection.</p>
            <p>However, Sir, while I return you thoſe thanks which, juſtice and gratitude oblige me to; I am extremely doubtful whether the public will conſider the favours I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, as any capital exertion of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on your part; for they will naturally ſay, that, as to your acting, the play could not poſſibly have done without it, which, after you had received it, muſt have been to your loſs; and, for giving me your wit and humour, all the world is ſenſible, that there is ſcarcely a man living who has ſo much to ſpare. I am,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following piece is a tranſlation of Le MALADE IMAGINAIRE, one of MOLIERE's moſt celebrated productions in the farcical kind. Some ſcenes which could not poſſibly ſucceed upon the Engliſh ſtage, have been removed, and thoſe ſubſtituted, in which the character of DOCTOR LAST is introduced; and, for that character only, the editor has to anſwer; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the ſubſequent ſcenes, being intirely his.</p>
            <p>How it has hitherto appeared upon the ſtage, or how it may appear hereafter, is at preſent of little conſequence. It is ſubmitted to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of intelligent readers, who will conſider a farce as ſuch, and decide upon it's merit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. To add more is needleſs, except thanks to the performers, particularly to Mr. Sowdon, for his kindneſs to the editor, when he ſtood in great need of aſſiſtance; and to that admirable comedian, Mr. Weſton, by whoſe excellent performance, Dr. Laſt is ſtill render'd a laughable object.</p>

            <l>YOUR ſervants, kind maſters, from bottom to top.</l>
            <l>Be aſſur'd, while I breath, or can walk—I mean hop,</l>
            <l>Be you pleaſed to ſmile, or be pleaſed to grumble,</l>
            <l>Be whatever you pleaſe, I am ſtill your moſt humble.</l>
            <l>As to laugh is a right only given to man,</l>
            <l>To keep up that right is my pride and my plan—</l>
            <l>Fair ladies, don't frown, I meant woman too—</l>
            <l>What's common to man, muſt be common to you.—</l>
            <l>You all have a right your ſweet muſcles to curl,</l>
            <l>From the old ſmirking prude, to the titt'ring young girl;</l>
            <l>And ever with pleaſure my brains I could ſpin,</l>
            <l>To make you all giggle, and you, ye gods, grin.</l>
            <l>In this preſent ſummer, as well as the paſt,</l>
            <l>To your favour again we preſent Dr. Laſt,</l>
            <l>Who, by wonderful feats, in the papers recounted,</l>
            <l>From trudging on foot, to his chariot has mounted.</l>
            <l>Amongſt the old Britons, when war was begun,</l>
            <l>Charioteers would ſlay ten, while the foot could ſlay one:</l>
            <l>So, when doctors on wheels with diſpatches are ſent,</l>
            <l>Mortality bills riſe a thouſand per cent.</l>
            <l>But think not to phyſic that quack'ry's confin'd,</l>
            <l>All the world is a ſtage, and the quacks are mankind—</l>
            <l>There's trade, law, and ſtate-quacks; nay, would we but ſearch,</l>
            <l>We ſhould find—Heaven bleſs us!—ſome quacks in the church!</l>
            <l>The ſtiff band, and ſtiff bob of the methodiſt race,</l>
            <l>Give the balſam of life and the tincture of grace,</l>
            <l>And their poor wretched patients think much good is done 'em,</l>
            <l>Tho' bliſters and cauſticks are ever upon them.</l>
            <l>As for law and the ſtate, if quack'ry's a curſe,</l>
            <l>Which will make the good bad, and the bad will make worſe,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:0058601800:6"/>We ſhould point out the quack, from the regular brother,</l>
            <l>They are wiſer than I who can tell one from t'other!</l>
            <l>Can the ſtage with its bills, puffs, and patents, ſtand trial,</l>
            <l>Shall we find out no quacks in the Theatre Royal?</l>
            <l>Some dramatical drugs that are puff'd on the town,</l>
            <l>Cauſe many wry faces, and ſcarce will <hi>go down.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Nay, an audience ſometimes will in quack'ry delight,</l>
            <l>And ſweat down an author ſome pounds in one night.</l>
            <l>To return to our quack—ſhould he, help'd by the weather,</l>
            <l>Raiſe laughter and kind perſpiration together,</l>
            <l>Should his noſtrums of hips and of vapours but cure ye,</l>
            <l>His chariot he well will deſerve, I aſſure ye.</l>
            <l>'Tis eaſy to ſet up a chariot in town,</l>
            <l>And eaſier ſtill is that chariot laid down.</l>
            <l>He petitions by me, both as doctor and lover,</l>
            <l>That you'll not ſtop his wheels, or his chariot tip over:</l>
            <l>Fix him well, I beſeech you, the worſt on't would be,</l>
            <l>Should you overturn <hi>him,</hi> you may <hi>overſet me.</hi>

                  <p>Really, doctor, I am afraid my diſorder is a complication. Sometimes I think it is the gout, ſometimes the rheumatiſm, ſometimes the dropſy, and ſometimes I feel myſelf in a high fever: however, gentlemen, Doctor Coffin here has been long my good friend and phyſician, and, by the help of the intelligence he can give you about my conſtitution, your art and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may perhaps enable you to find out what's<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0058601800:25"/> the matter with me; ſo I leave you to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation.

                  <p>True; why, there was yeſterday, the firſt pulſe I felt belonged to a lad with the meaſles, in Dean's-yard, Weſtminſter: from thence I ſet out between ſeven and eight, my wig freſh powdered, and my horſes in ſpirits; I turned at Charing Croſs for the New Buildings; then run through the Holbourn diviſion, croſſed the Fleet-market, and penetrated into the city as far as Whitechapel; then, made a ſhort trip to the wife of a ſaleſman, who had the gout in her ſtomach, at Wapping; from thence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned through Cornhill, Temple-Bar, and the Strand, and finiſhed my laſt preſcription, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween five and ſix, for a tradeſman in Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur-ſtreet, who had burſt a vein in hallooing at the Brentford election.</p>

                  <p>My inclinations are mutual, Miſs, and not to be chang'd; for the fire of love, as I may ſay, is ſhot from your beautiful eyes into my heart; and, I cou'd ſay more—if it was not out of reſpect to the company.</p>

                  <p>Yes, that I am to the ſoul: I thought ſhe wanted to inſinuate that I did not love you, my dear; and any thing of that kind is worſe to me than ten thouſand daggers.</p>

                  <p>I have been at a great deal of pains and trouble, and made many experiments, in order to find a radical cure for this diſeaſe, that ſhould be at once ſafe, cheap, and eaſy: my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention was a pump; by means of which, fix'd in the belly of the patient, I meant to pump out the dropſical humour, as you wou'd water out of the hold of a ſhip; threeſcore and eleven people died under the operation.</p>

                  <p>Well; what is the loſs of a few indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, for the general good of mankind? You brought it to perfection at laſt?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wag.</speaker>
                  <p>No; at laſt, I found it was impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; yet, I wou'd have gone on in hopes, but people grew chicken-hearted, and wou'd not let me try.</p>

                  <speaker>D. Laſt.</speaker>
                  <p>So they well might—You ſhou'd not pump me in that manner for five thouſand pound.</p>

                  <speaker>Wag.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir, my next experiment was call'd the ſoaking operation; which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd thus: I made the patient ſwallow a piece of ſpunge, faſten'd to a ſtring, which going down his throat into his ſtomach, I let lye there, till it had abſorb'd or ſoak'd up the watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0058601800:52"/> and then, drew it up again, with all it contents; repeating the operation, till I had lef the body as dry as an empty decanter.</p>

                  <speaker>Wag.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I had a great deal better ſucceſs with this than the former; for, I think, it kill'd but four and twenty.</p>

                  <p>No, no, brother, we'll leave her out of the queſtion; ſhe's a good woman, that has the beſt intentions in the world for your family, is free from all manner of ſelf-intereſt, has a marvellous tenderneſs for you, and ſhews an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable affection to your children, that's certain.—We'll ſay no more, therefore, of her, but return to your daughter; but, pray, let me aſk you with what view wou'd you marry her to this Dr. Laſt?</p>

                  <p>I profeſs my eyes are dazzled, and all my ſenſes confus'd; I know not what I either hear or ſee; but, in the firſt place, I renounce phyſic—</p>

               <sp>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>This, brother, is the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I propoſe as a match for your daughter; and after what I have ſaid, and what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, I hope, you will no longer refuſe to liſten to his prentions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ail.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, really, Sir, my chief objection to you, is your total ignorance of the medicinal art; if you can think of any method to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that—</p>

                  <speaker>Ail.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, with regard to the more capital branches, I grant you; but in the ſubaltern of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, I'm of a contrary opinion; ſuppoſe now you were to bind yourſelf apprentice for a year or two to ſome ſkilful apothecary; ſurely, in that time you might learn to decypher a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and make up a medicine with very few blunders.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Har.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Ail.</speaker>
                  <p>You might, indeed, now and then give a doſe of arſenick for ſalts; but that's an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent might happen to the oldeſt practitioner.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, brother, brother, what's this I hear! It was but this moment you were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to renounce phyſic, and here you are talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as warmly and abſurdly about it as ever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ail.</speaker>
                  <p>Eh!—It's very true, indeed, brother.—However, let it ſuffice, I give the young man my daughter without any conditions at all; and now, I'll go and get effectually rid of that other plague my wife; for I ſhall not be eaſy while we areunder the ſame roof.</p>

               <l>LADIES and gentlemen, they've ſent me out—</l>
               <l>But I'm afraid to tell you what about;</l>
               <l>Becauſe 'twere bold in me, perhaps you'll ſay,</l>

               <l>I'm come to beg you'd like it for my ſake.</l>
               <l>The author took me in his arms juſt now,</l>
               <l>My dear, ſays he—he kiſs'd me too I vow—</l>
               <l>If you'll go out and make the audience clap,</l>
               <l>I'll give you ribbons and a fine new cap:</l>
               <l>Beſides, he promis'd me, next time he comes</l>
               <l>Behind the ſcenes, to bring me ſugar-plumbs.</l>
               <l>But whatſoe'er you think the play to be,</l>
