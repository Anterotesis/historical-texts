            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I HAD long ſuſpected that the Peruvian Bark in common uſe, was very inferior in power and efficacy to that recommended by the early writers on the ſubject; but, more eſpecially by our countrymen, <hi>MORTON</hi> and <hi>SYDENHAM,</hi> in whoſe works the medical virtues of this Drug, in Intermittent and other Fevers are extolled as little ſhort of infallibility. In their time the Quill Bark was not mentioned; their cotemporary writers on the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> evidently deſcribe the Peruvian Bark of that period, as of a larger kind, of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact pieces, and of the colour of the ruſt of <hi>Iron,</hi> which marks are very expreſſive of the <hi>Red Bark,;</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt coat of which has an <hi>ochry</hi> appearance, and its reſinous or middle layer reſembles very much the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Haematitis.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. SPRINGALL of <hi>Thames Street,</hi> (whoſe Uncle was, in the the year 1702, with SIR GEORGE ROOKE, at the taking of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleons, in the harbour of <hi>Vigo</hi> in <hi>Gallicia</hi>) had a quantity of Peruvian Bark, which was part of the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brought home at that time. It was bought, about four years ago, by Mr. PEARSON, an Apothecary in <hi>Spital Square,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me that it was the Red Bark: its Decoction was much ſtronger than that of the Common Bark, and he found it very efficacious in the cure of Fevers and other Diſeaſes. This ſeems a collateral proof of the Red Bark being early in uſe.</p>
               </note> 
               <hi>M. LA CONDAMINE</hi> expreſſed his
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0129401100:6"/>ſurpriſe, when he was told by Mr. <hi>THOMAS BLACHYN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN,</hi> Director of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> South Sea Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, at <hi>Panama,</hi> that the writers on <hi>Pharmacy</hi> and <hi>Materia Medica</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had preferred the Small and Quill Bark, while the inhabitants of <hi>New Spain,</hi> held the larger Bark in higher eſtimation.<note n="†" place="bottom">They commonly reckon three ſpecies of the <hi>Quinquina,</hi> tho ſome make four; the white, the yellow, and the red: I was told at <hi>Loxa,</hi> that theſe three kinds differ in their virtue only; the white having ſcarce any virtue, and the red excelling the yellow.
<p>The trees from whence the firſt Bark was taken, which were very large, are all dead, having been entirely ſtripped, which infallibly ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls them when they come to be old. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has ſhewn that ſtripping kills ſome of the young ones alſo, but the greateſt part eſcape. For this operation they uſe a common knife, which they hold in both hands; the barker ſticks it into the Bark as high as he can reach, and ſo draws it downwards as low as he can. It does not appear that the trees which grow where the old ones ſtood, have leſs virtue than they, the ſituation and ſoil being the ſame; the difference, if there be any, may ariſe, perhaps, from the different ages of the trees. Few but young ones are now to be met with: I do not remember to have ſeen any much thicker than my arm, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 12 or 15 feet high; thoſe which are cut young, ſhoot forth new branches from the ſtumps.</p>
                  <p>I was informed at <hi>Loxa,</hi> that heretofore, they preferred the coarſeſt Bark, and laid it by as a rarity, but now the fineſt is moſt eſteemed: the merchants may poſſibly find their account in it, as it takes up leſs room in packing. But a director of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> South Sea Company at <hi>Panama.</hi> through which all the <hi>Quinquina</hi> that comes to <hi>Europe</hi> muſt paſs, aſſured me, that the preference given at preſent to the fine Bark, is in conſequence of ſeveral chymical analyſes and experiments which have been made on both ſorts in <hi>England.</hi> It ſeems probable, that the difficulty of thoroughly drying the large coarſe bark, and the humidity it is naturally apt to contract and retain, has hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to bring it into diſrepute. Vulgar prejudice will have it, that to loſe nothing of its virtue, the tree ſhould be barked in the moon's decreaſe, and on the eaſt ſide. Theſe circumſtances, as alſo its being gathered on the mountain of <hi>Cajanuma,</hi> were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by a notary in 1735. where the marquis de <hi>Caſtelfuerte</hi> procured a quantity of <hi>Quinquina</hi> from <hi>Loxa,</hi> to carry to <hi>Spain</hi> on his return. Memoir de l'Acad. d. Sc. 1738.</p>
               </note> I can only explain ſuch a preference from this circumſtance,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0129401100:7"/>that the larger pieces of Bark which were imported into this country along with the ſmaller Bark, were either of a <hi>fibrous, ſpongy,</hi> or <hi>ligneous</hi> texture; or, probably damaged by moiſture, and taken from decayed trees.</p>
            <p>Druggiſts have ſometimes ſuggeſted this as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the uſe of the preſent Bark, and many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably endeavour to oppoſe its introduction, until the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in the markets be greater, and more equally divided
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0129401100:8"/>among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or until they have been able to diſpoſe of the large quantity of common Bark they have in their warehouſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>flavour</hi> of the <hi>Red Bark</hi> is more difficultly evolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is therefore at firſt not ſo obv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous from the cloſeneſs of its texture, and from the reſinous coat being ſo well defended and incloſed between other two layers. It is evidently heavier thin any other kind of Bark, and ſeems to have been prepared and dried with g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eater attenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, its original appearance and form being better preſerved.</p>
            <p>I think it probable from a more attentive view of the ſubject that it may be the Bark of the trunk of the tree, and I am the more confirmed in this opinion by the ideas of my friends <hi>Dr. WITHERING</hi> and <hi>Dr. FO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERGILL,</hi> conveyed in their letters to me; in which, they obſerve that the eſſential and active parts of the Oak Bark are more intire, and in larger quantity in the trunk and larger branches, than in the twigs or ſmaller branches, which are comparatively of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect growth, perhaps the Small and Quilled Bark may be procured from younger trees not yet arrived at
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0129401100:9"/>their full maturity and therefore yielding a Bark of a weaker quality.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. ARROT, a Scotch Surgeon who had gathered the Bark in the place where it grows, ſays that the ſmall curled Bark ſo much eſteemed in England is the Bark of younger Trees, which frequently recover the Barking, while the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Trees never do. This affords a ſtrong proof that the early Bark introduced into Europe was of the larger kind and from the older Trees, while the difficulty of procuring it, has been the means of introducing a ſmaller and younger Bark. Mr. ARROT, and all other Travellers agree, in preferring the Red Bark to any other.

            <p>If the execution of this work was equal to its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it would challenge the attention of the public, in a degree far above moſt medical ſubjects. This will be unqueſtionably admitted by thoſe who have been eye witn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſes to the fatality and malignancy of <hi>intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and <hi>remittent Fevers</hi> in every part of the globe, but more eſpecially in warm climates; this fatality is by no means owing to the ignorance or unſkifulneſs of the practitioners in thoſe countries, but to the inefficacy of the Common Bark in general uſe.</p>
            <p>The numbers, who fall a ſacrifice to the <hi>Epidemic</hi> and <hi>Seaſoning Fevers</hi> of <hi>warm Climates,</hi> are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0129401100:10"/>infinitely to exceed thoſe who are deſtroyed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. In almoſt all the dangerous Fevers which occur in our <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt India Settlements,</hi> the Bark is a principal <hi>Remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it therefore an object of the greateſt national importance, that our <hi>Fleets</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> ſhould be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally ſupplied with this Bark which will ſeldom or ever diſappoint them. I have been told by a Druggiſt, that its great <hi>activity</hi> rendered it a dangerous remedy, my anſwer was that wine mixed with water was much ſafer in the hands of an unſkilful practitioner, than wine alone, but that did not prove that wine was not a better cordial than water. The ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me reaſoning may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to prove, that weak and decayed remedies, by being much milder in their operations, are therefore preferable to ſuch as are more perfect of their kind. I believe the general and beſt founded complaint is againſt the want of power and efficacy of Bark, and not that it is too powerful and active. In proof of this I refer my Readers to the Letters annexed, which evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that ſuch was the ſtubborneſs and obſtinacy of the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0129401100:11"/>
               <hi>Intermittent Fevers</hi> of this year, even in this country, that they reſiſted common Bark, and only gave way to the <hi>Red Bark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I formed very early a favourable opinion of this Bark, yet it fell far ſhort of that which I am now juſtified in maintaining from the collected evidence of ſo many Gentlemen in diſtant and remote parts of the country. Many letters which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived are wrote with ſuch zeal in favour of its ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior efficacy, that they could only be dictated by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conviction ariſing from extenſive and diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p>I have perſuaded many of my Medical friends to uſe the <hi>Red Bark</hi> in our foreign ſettlements, and, ſhall take pleaſure in communicating to the public the reſult of their obſervations ſo ſoon as I am favoured with them. A more powerful Bark is particularly deſireable in thoſe countries, where the violence and danger of the paroxyſm is ſo great. In the following obſervations, I have confined myſelf very much to the uſe of the Red
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0129401100:12"/>Bark in febrile Diſeaſes, but I am in poſſeſſion of many facts in proof of its ſuperior powers in other diſeaſes in which the common Peruvian Bark has been found uſeful.</p>
            <p>The public may be always aſſured of the fidelity of my obſervations, and that my only motive is that of reſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring to general uſe a <hi>remedy</hi> which was found ſo efficacious by <hi>MORTON</hi> and <hi>SYDENHAM,</hi> and which in the hands ſkilful Phyſicians may be conſidered as an antidote to the fatal influence of <hi>Marſhy Grounds</hi> and <hi>Unhealthy Climates.</hi>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1779, a Spaniſh Ship from <hi>Lima,</hi> bound to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> was taken by the <hi>Huſſar Frigate</hi> and carried into <hi>Liſbon;</hi> her cargo conſiſted chiefly of this Bark, a part of which was afterwards brought into this country, and purchaſed by ſeveral Druggiſts in <hi>London.</hi> It is of ſo large a kind, and has ſo coarſe an appearance, that it was with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty they could prevail on Medical Practitioners to preſcribe it. Its reputation was firſt eſtabliſhed by trials made in the public Hoſpitals, and its ſuperior efficacy has been well aſcertained by the moſt attentive obſervation.</p>
            <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0129401100:14"/>
            <p>In the following pages are contained ſome very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting matters of fact, which will throw much light on the choice of this drug, and on the general applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bark in the cure of Agues and other Fevers. Altho' the general title, by which it was ſold, was that of <hi>Quinquina,</hi> yet it was ſuppoſed by our Druggiſts to be a new medicine. They called it the red Bark; it appears however, both from an attention to its ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities and the information procured from <hi>Spain,</hi> that it is the true <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> of a quality probably ſuperior to any ever known in this country. This fact is farther proved by its being found ſometimes in ſmall detached pieces amongſt other Bark, it ſeems however hitherto to have eſcaped our particular notice.</p>
            <p>The Author highly ſenſible of the difficulty of eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing facts either on the effects of remedies, or on any branch of medicine which regards the Animal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, has ſolicited the opinion of many ingenious and attentive practitioners, who from their ſituation have had frequent opportunities of trying the Red Bark.
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0129401100:15"/>This caution appeared the more neceſſary, becauſe he is well perſuaded that the love of novelty, and too great a credulity in admitting falſe facts, on very doubtful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, have corrupted medicine more than any other Science, and proved more injurious than the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and fanciful theories, the errors of which are eaſily detected.</p>

            <head>Of its Natural Hiſtory.</head>
            <p>IT is the Bark of a Tree which grows in the neighbourhood of <hi>Loxa</hi> chiefly on the mountain of <hi>Cajanuma.</hi> It is propagated ſpontaneouſly. The tree is ſeldom more than <hi>fifteen</hi> feet high. Its trunk and branches of a proportional thickneſs. The Bark is carefully cut off in the dry ſeaſon, and gently dried by the heat of the Sun, before it is packed for foreign uſe. It has been diſtinguiſhed into the white, yellow and red, the laſt is generally preferred, but they are only to be conſidered as varieties of the ſame tree, depending on ſoil, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and other accidental circumſtances. Perhaps the age of the tree and the ſize of it branches, from whence the Bark is taken, as well as the care and attention beſtowed in the preparing it, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence its powers and efficacy. I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0129401100:17"/>that the Bark of which we are now treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the <hi>"Cinchona officinalis Linn. Sp. pl.</hi> 244 <hi>mat. Med.</hi> 71 <hi>Quinquina De la Condamine Memoir del' Acad. d. Sc.</hi> 1738 <hi>p.</hi> 226 <hi>t.</hi> 5 <hi>fig. A. E. &amp; t.</hi> 6 <hi>f. F.</hi> S.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Old Spain</hi> always preferred the larger Bark, and from the account of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, I am diſpoſed to believe that more attention is paid in collecting and drying the Bark which is conſumed in <hi>Spain,</hi> than what is brought to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign market. I hope that the information which I ſhall give on this ſubject will ſtimulate Druggiſts to procure the Red Peruvian Bark, and remove the prejudices which have prevailed againſt ſo large a Bark in favour of the ſmall, thin, and quilled Bark, hitherto the ſubject of their choice.</p>
            <p>This Red Bark is very diſtinguiſhable from thoſe large coarſe woody and fibrous maſſes, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally mixed with the common Peruvian Bark.</p>

            <head>Of its Senſible Qualities.</head>
            <p>THE Red Bark is in much larger and thicker pieces than the common Peruvian Bark. It evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſiſts of three diſtinct layers. The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thin, rugged, and frequently covered with a moſſy ſubſtance, and of a reddiſh brown colour. The middle, thicker, more compact, and of a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er colour. In this appears chiefly to reſide its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous part, being extremely brittle, and evidently containing a larger quantity of inflammable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other kind of Bark.</p>
            <p>The innermoſt has a more woody and fibrous appearance, of a brighter red than the former.</p>
            <p>The intire piece breaks in that brittle manner deſcribed by writers on the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> as a proof of the ſuperiour excellence of the Bark.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0129401100:19"/>
            <p>In reducing it to powder, the middle layer, which ſeems to contain the greateſt proportion of Reſin, will not give way to the peſtle ſo eaſily as the other layers; this ſhould be particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to when it is uſed in fine powder. Its flavour is chiefly diſcoverable either in powder or ſolution, is evidently more aromatic, and has a greater degree of bitterneſs than the common Bark.</p>

               <p>The colour of the two infuſions was very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that made with the Red Bark being much deeper. The taſte and flavour of the infuſion of the red Bark were conſiderably more powerful than of the other.

The ſuperiour taſte and flavour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the red Bark was equally obſervable with that in the infuſion.

               <p>The ſame experiment, under ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was made with the common Bark.

               <p>The Tinctures both of Experiments 5. and 6. were by a gentle hen evaporated to the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a reſinous extract.</p>
               <p>The Extract from the Tincture of the red Bark was of a ſmooth homogeneous appearance, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Balſam of Peru, when thickened: The flavour and taſte of the original Tincture were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely preſerved in it.</p>
               <p>The Extract from the common Bark had a very different appearance. It ſeemed coarſe and gritty, and by no means ſo characteriſtic of its original tincture.</p>
               <p>The quantity of extract procured from the red Bark was conſiderably more than from the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0129401100:24"/>quantity of common Bark; but, as the <hi>reſiduum</hi> of neither was rendered entirely inert, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute quantity could not be aſcertained.<note n="*" place="bottom">To 26 lb. of red Bark were added 26 Gallons of proof ſpirit, after remaining together for ſome time the Tincture was poured off, and ſubmitted to a diſtillation in a water bath, the quantity of ſpiritous extract obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was lb. 12 ½ a quantity of water being poured on the <hi>reſiduum</hi> of the Tincture, the watery extract obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was lb. 4.
<p>In another experiment, with lb. 30 of red Bark, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner as the former, only lb. 11 ½ of ſpiritous extract was procured, and lb. 4 ½ of watery extract.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The advantages therefore to be expected from the red Bark cannot be obtained from any quantity of common Bark. The beſt common Bark, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the red Bark, appears inert and effete.</p>
               <p>All the above experiments were executed in the preſence of ſeveral Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>I was led more particularly to proſecute this ſubject, from ah opinion that the red Bark might ſufficiently impregnate cold water by infuſion, ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0129401100:28"/>as to cure intermittent fevers with more certainty than could be done even by the decoction or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of common Bark. The ſenſible qualities which appear from the above experiments, being ſo much greater, in the cold infuſion of the one than in the decoction of the other.</p>
               <p>As a proof of the ſuperior antiſeptic power of the red Bark, both its cold infuſion and decoction preſerved entire their bitter and other medicated powers, while the infuſion and decoction of the common Bark, prepared at the ſame time, had alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether loſt their ſenſible qualities.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the month of <hi>June,</hi> a large quantity of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of red Bark, which had been kept for <hi>five</hi> weeks in the Elaboratory of GUYS HOSPITAL, was equally good at the expiration of that time, as when firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; while a decoction of common Bark, gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent appearances of a change in a few days.
<p>In the decoction of the red Bark the powder which is ſeperated during the cooling of it, remains intimately diffured thro' Liquor, ſo that it continues loaded, and turbid while at reſt. In the decoction of common Bark, it ſeperates and eaſily ſubſides to the Bottom.</p>

               <p>The following remarks are intended to apply to the Peruvian Bark, generally in uſe; but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the effects enumerated are found to be produced in a much higher degree by the red Bark.</p>
               <p>The cold infuſion of Bark ſeems evidently to promote both appetite and digeſtion, it increaſes the tone and action of the ſtomach, by which the Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0129401100:30"/>liquor, the great <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of our ſolid ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is more perfectly prepared.</p>
               <p>In moſt caſes, the Bark rather promotes coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the common effect of ſtrong and vigorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. In very large doſes however it proves purgative, but this effect ceaſes after a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>It renders the pulſe ſtronger and fuller in health, and in moſt diſeaſes unaccompained with fever.</p>
               <p>In low and malignant fevers, and more eſpecially under remiſſion, it renders the pulſe ſtronger and even flower.</p>
               <p>In particular circumſtances of fever marked with debility and a tendency to remiſſion, tho' of a very irregular type, it deminiſhes febrile heat.</p>
               <p>It encreaſes the animal heat and aggravates every Symptom, in fevers accompanied either with much local inflammation, or a general inflammatory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, which is ſtrongly indicated by the pulſe the manner of the original attack, the want of due
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0129401100:31"/>freedom in the ſecretions, and the painful and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive exerciſe of every function.</p>
               <p>It checks profuſe and colliquative diſcharges, eſpecially thoſe by the ſkin, while it does not ſeem to diminiſh inſenſible perſpiration, or other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evacuations.</p>
               <p>It checks every tendency to putrefaction or gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, occurring under circumſtances of debility, but if may promote both, if injudiciouſly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while the action of the ſyſtem is too violent, or the inflammatory diatheſis is too prevalent. It ſeems more reſonable to refer its action, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeptic, to its tonic power on the moving ſyſtem, than to any primary action on the animal fluids.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this doctrine will apply in explaining the hiſtory of remedies uſed in the Scurvy, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe invited and avoured by every means which can induce debility, and evidently preceded by ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Its action here can only be explained from its general tonic power, for either general or local de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility retards ſuppuration and favours the obſtinacy of ill conditioned ulcers.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame principle its power of promoting the ſuppuration, and generation of true <hi>pus</hi> in the ſmall pox may be explained.</p>

               <p>In delicate and irritable habits, which ſeem more eſpecially to favour ſcrophulous affections, and which produce inflammation of a peculiar nature, that gives way ſooner to tonics than evacuants, the Bark has been found the beſt remedy: This may probably admit of the explanation already given on the ſubject of Scurvy.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0129401100:34"/>with prejudice of any kind, ill favour of any particular theory, or a blind attachment to ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the cautious and timid practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner has very generally forbid the uſe of Bark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til evacuations ſhould have been made; I am very well perſuaded from obſervation that in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fevers, ſuch as rage and are endemic, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticurlarly in low and marſhy ſituations, and ſuch as frequently occur on the banks of the Thames, and the lower parts of this metropolis the Bark cannot be given too early, the uſe of either emetics or purgatives, as preparatory, is not only unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but in ſome caſes productive of more debility, and therefore to be avoided.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of concoction however juſt it may be in continued fevers, and in ſome caſes of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, does not apply in intermittents produced by the <hi>Miaſmata</hi> of low and ſwampy grounds, and which afford the principal ſource of agues in the environs of this City.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0129401100:35"/>
               <p>In this opinion I am confirmed by the teſtimony of Dr. CLEGHORN and others; who frequently found it neceſſary to give it on the firſt acceſſion of the diſeaſe in order effectually to obviate, or weaken the return of a ſecond paroxyſm, which in many caſes would inevitably have proved fatal, and Dr. LIND has very properly obſerved that ſuch ſymptoms from viſceral obſtructions, which have been attributed to Bark, are rather the effect of the paroxyſm being allowed to return, from the omiſſion of that medicine.</p>
               <p>There are many ſymptoms which would forbid the uſe of Bark, did they occur diſtinct and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of intermittent fever, ſuch as cough, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing and pain in the ſide: they are frequently brought on by the paroxyſm of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, and only give way to the uſe of the Bark by which that paroxyſm may be prevented. Such ſymptoms do not admit of a diſtinct and ſeparate treatment, but are always aggravated by the uſe of Evacuants, more eſpecially bleeding, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0129401100:36"/>means of relieving in common depuratory fevers.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes found a complication of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent and Hectic fever in the ſame perſon, and could diſtinguiſh between the paroxyſms of each: the Bark while it cured the intermittent, has even moderated the Hectic; tho' Hectic fever of itſelf, eſpecially as a ſymptom of <hi>Phthiſis Pulmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis</hi> does not appear to give way at any time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uſe of the Bark; I think it probable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that altho' in the treatment of intermittents complicated with other diſeaſes, our chief attention ſhould be firſt directed to the cure of the intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet it may be neceſſary to purſue an indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that may have in view the other diſorders, not incompatible with the treatment of the intermittent. In dropſies, which accompany intermittents, I have found more benefit from the uſe of Bark, joined to the neutral ſalts, and other mild diuretics, than from active purgatives, which always tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the intermittent. Every returning paroyxſin
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0129401100:37"/>of an ague confirms more and more the cauſe of that diſeaſe which it has produced.</p>
               <p>It is not intended to inſinuate that no caſes do occur, in which it may not be prudent to adminiſter a vomit, eſpecially to perſons ſubject to bilious accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations in the ſtomach: but this is more with a view of removing an obſtacle to the operation of Bark, than as neceſſary to render it ſafe, and I have frequently ſeen <hi>nauſea</hi> and vomiting ſo much a ſymptom of the paroxyſm, that they gave way only to the free uſe of Bark itſelf.</p>
               <p>A practice more abſurd than that of preceding evacuations has been adopted and recommended. <hi>viz.</hi> that of evacuating by purgatives after the cure had been compleated by the Bark, this ſeldom fails of bringing back the intermittent, as one cauſe of inducing debility, the moſt favourable ſtate of the body for the attack of intermittent fevers.</p>
               <p>In perſons who are rendered coſtive by the uſe of the Bark, I would recommend the common
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0129401100:38"/>practice of giving a few grains of Rhubarb, or <hi>Pilul. Rufi.</hi> If on the other hand it ſhould prove pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, a few drops of the <hi>Thebaic Tincture</hi> is the uſual and beſt means of checking that operation.</p>
               <p>Intermittent fevers are frequently ſo very ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous in their appearances and aſſume ſo much the character of other diſeaſes that an unſkilful, or an inattentive practitioner may be deceived; they however, under any form or any type, generally give way to the Bark; ſometimes aided and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other means.</p>
               <p>Both the Vernal and Autumnal intermittents of Dr. SYDENHAM yield to it, the latter however ſometimes with more obſtinacy than the former.</p>
               <p>In ſeveral caſes I have experienced the ſuperior efficacy of the red Bark in removing <hi>Tertians</hi> and <hi>Quartans</hi> which had reſiſted the common Bark, this however is not to be wondered at, when we conſider the diverſity in the power even of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of the common Bark in general uſe.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0129401100:39"/>
               <p>I hope I ſhall be excuſed in digreſſing ſo far, as to mention the uſeful effects I have frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced from the exhibition of Opium in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fevers. We are chiefly indebted for this practice to Dr. LIND. It moderates ſo effectually the force of the paroxyſm by ſhortening the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cold fit, as well as by diminiſhing the violence of the hot fit, that I had often flattered myſelf it was capable of curing intermittents. In this however I was diſappointed.</p>
               <p>From the experience of it in many hundred caſes, I conclude with Dr. LIND. <q>"That an Opiate given ſoon after the commencement of the hot fit, by abating the violence and leſſening the duration of the fever, preſerves the conſtitution ſo entirely uninjured, that ſince I uſed Opium in agues, neither a dropſy nor jaundice has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked any of my patients in theſe diſeaſes."</q> The manner in which I employ it, is either by giving a grain of the <hi>Thebaic</hi> extract upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the cold fit, or <hi>twenty</hi> drops of the <hi>Theba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic</hi> tincture upon the acceſſion of the hot fit, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0129401100:40"/>of the former being later from its flower ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility.</p>
               <p>The red Bark is ſo much warmer than the other, that it would ſeem to anſwer all the purpoſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the union of cordials, aromatics, ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria and the like ſo much recommended in the obſtinate <hi>Quartan</hi> intermittents of elderly people.</p>
               <p>Some difference in opinion has prevailed regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of giving the Bark. Moſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners concur in thinking that it cures intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents more readily when taken in ſubſtance than in any other form. In this ſtate, it is both a bulky and nauſeous doſe in the quantity neceſſary to cure an intermittent, at any rate, it ought rather to be diffuſed in ſome liquid, than given in the form of an electuary or pills, which are ſometimes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly ſoluble.</p>
               <p>I have found milk cover the taſte of Bark and make it more acceptable to children than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vehicle. The extract of liquorice diſſolved
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0129401100:41"/>in water, may be likewiſe employed to cover the taſte of Bark. Its taſte is alſo corrected by wine, eſpecially by Old Hock.</p>
               <p>It would appear from the general preference given to Bark in ſubſtance, that its decoction, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or tincture are found too weak in any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity for the purpoſe of curing intermittents, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as they are much lighter to the ſtomach and act more quickly, they ſhould be preferred.</p>
               <p>I hope to make it appear that in this reſpect the red Bark has evidently the advantage of any other kind now in uſe, ſince either its infuſion or decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will cure intermittents, and that its powder in a much ſmaller doſe than that of common Bark will produce ſimilar effects.</p>
               <p>The beſt time for giving the Bark is in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion between the paroxyſms and when the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is empty. In <hi>Quartan</hi> fevers, where there are <hi>two</hi> days of <hi>Apyrexia,</hi> we ſhould be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous of getting down a large quantity on the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0129401100:42"/>day immediately preceding the approaching pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm, and in other intermittents as near the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the returning paroxyſm as the ſtomach will bear it.</p>
               <p>It is unneceſſary to limit the doſe. One drachm may be given every hour, if the ſtomach will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and will remove the diſeaſe more quickly than a ſmaller quantity given at longer periods.<note n="*" place="margin">I have likewiſe frequently adopted the practice recommended by Dr. HOME, of giving the Bark ſo ſoon as the ſweating fit of the fever has ſufficiently carried off the hot fit; this is particularly proper when the interval is ſhort between the paroxyſms.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The following facts will beſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how far I am juſtified in favouring the opinion of the ſuperior excellence of the red Bark.</p>
               <p>EDWARD VIRGOE, aged 21, had laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an intermittent fever <hi>five</hi> months. It was firſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0129401100:43"/>a <hi>tertian</hi> and afterwards became a regular <hi>Quotidian,</hi> accompanied with cough, dyſpnoea and hoarſeneſs particularly in the paroxyſm. The common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uvian Bark, given in the doſe of one drachm every hour prevented the return of the paroxyſm for a few days; the patient however ſoon relapſed not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Bark was continued, he was at laſt cured by taking one drachm of the red Bark eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecond hour for the ſpace of <hi>ten</hi> days.</p>
               <p>It appears from the above caſe of <hi>Edward Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,</hi> and ſeveral others which have occurred to me, that intermittent fevers which had reſiſted common Bark and other remedies, have yielded to the red Bark, even under very complicated and unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearances.</p>
               <p>In this opinion I am likewiſe juſtified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and teſtimony of many eminent practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and ſo decided are they in its favour that the demand for it every day increaſes, eſpecially in ſome of the neighbouring counties where intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are not only more frequent, but more obſtinate.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0129401100:44"/>
               <p>I began now to ſuſpect that its powers were even ſufficient in cold infuſion in moſt caſes to cure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent fevers, and in all other caſes to anſwer every purpoſe which might be expected from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peruvian Bark, in any form in which it had hitherto been employed.</p>
               <p>The following facts are ſufficient to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe this opinion.</p>
               <p>JAMES YOUNGMAN, aged 16, had laboured under a <hi>tertian</hi> intermittent many months; it was accompanied with a ſevere cough, and his ſtrength was conſiderably impaired. He was ordered to take <hi>four</hi> ounces of the cold infuſion of the red Bark every <hi>third</hi> hour; after taking it for <hi>two</hi> days the paroxyſm did not return. Its uſe was perſevered in <hi>fourteen</hi> days, and he continued perfectly well.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PUGH, aged 22, from <hi>Woolwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> had an intermittent fever of <hi>five</hi> weeks ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Tertian</hi> type, accompanied with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of cough, occurring eſpecially in the cold fit, he took the cold infuſion, as recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0129401100:45"/>in the former caſe, ſince which time he had only one flight return of the paroxyſm, his cough is likewiſe totally removed.</p>
               <p>JOHN WELDING, aged 25, had an intermittent fever at <hi>Sheerneſs</hi> for near a year, he took, large quantities of common Peruvian Bark without effect. It was of the <hi>Quotidian</hi> type. After taking a cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the red Bark in the quantity of a quart in <hi>twenty-four</hi> hours for <hi>three</hi> days, the paroxyſm diſappeared and has never ſince returned. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at firſt purgative but ſoon loſt that effect. His ſtrength and appetite were greatly improved, under the uſe of the infuſion.</p>
               <p>The cold infuſion employed in the above caſes was prepared by pouring a quart of cold water on <hi>two</hi> ounces of the red Bark in fine powder, frequently, agitating them for the ſpace of <hi>twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four</hi> hours.<note n="‡" place="margin">Tho' the caſes above mentioned evidently prove that the cold infuſion will cure Agues, yet they are not intended to divert the attention from other more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of giving this Medecine.</note>

               <head>Of its uſe in the cure of other Fevers.</head>
               <p>Remittent fevers are frequently equally ſteady in their periods of remiſſion and acceſſion with thoſe of the intermittent kind, but the <hi>Apyrexia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs perfect and complete has given riſe to many doubts regarding the ſafety of giving Bark. As remittent fevers are more particularly marked by appearances indicating the prevalence of bile in the ſtomach; the propriety of giving an <hi>Emetic,</hi> prior to the uſe of the Bark, ſeems well aſcertained, and the remiſſion is frequently rendered more complete by ſuch a practice.</p>
               <p>In the remitting fevers, however, of warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, the acceſſion of the paroxyſm is ſo extremely violent, and the ſtrength of the patient ſo quickly exhauſted, that it becomes abſolutely neceſſary to catch the firſt opportunity of the moſt trifling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and to give the Bark with the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that you would do in common intermittents.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0129401100:47"/>
               <p>In remitting fevers, the concomitant ſymptoms are more to be regarded than in intermittents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they more eſpecially diſturb, interrupt, and ſhorten the periods of remiſſion; even in the warmeſt climates, and under the ſevereſt prejudices, it has been ſound neceſſary to take away a few ounces of blood to relieve pain in the head, oppreſſion in breathing, an intenſe dry heat on the ſkin, and other ſymptoms protracting the paroxyſm; by ſuch means the remiſſion has been brought on, and the Bark given with more effect.</p>
               <p>The fevers of this country ſeldom have regular remiſſions, until they have been properly treated by evacuations; the inflammatory by bleeding, and the bilious by vomiting and purging.</p>
               <p>When fevers are brought into a ſtate of obvious remiſſion, that is, when the pulſe becomes from 10 to 20 ſlower at ſome particular time in the 24 hours; when the reſtleſſneſs, anxiety, and tendency to delirium abate; when the mouth and fauces are moiſt; when the organs of ſecretion, and eſpecially
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0129401100:48"/>the ſkin are more open and pervious, ſuch ſymptoms of remiſſion admit the uſe of Bark with the ſame freedom as in intermitting fevers.</p>
               <p>The acute rheumatiſm, notwithſtanding its inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory attack, and the appearance of the blood, and although the joints often continue inflamed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weeks, very early aſſumes the form of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever.</p>
               <p>Under ſuch circumſtances, a perſeverance in the <hi>Antiphlogiſtic</hi> plan is generally found to be ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. I have, in ſeveral caſes of this kind, employed a cold infuſion of the red Bark, and the diſeaſe ſeemed to give way only to this treatment.</p>
               <p>The acute rheumatiſm in its remiſſions aſſumes the form of a double <hi>Tertian,</hi> and the patient is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently greatly exhauſted by the profuſe ſweatings which terminate the paroxyſm.</p>
               <p>It is in ſuch caſes that I would particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the uſe of Bark. I have found this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0129401100:49"/>more ſucceſsful, and it muſt be allowed to be more rational than the uſe of <hi>Volatiles</hi> and <hi>Guaiac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It does not appear to me in any degree repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to juſt theory founded on obſervations made in ſimilar caſes, that at a time when the lancet may be uſed moderately or topical bleeding with more freedom, the Bark may be given ſo as to obviate the debility of a long and tedious diſeaſe, and by keeping up the ſtrength of the ſyſtem, prevent that torpor and diſpoſition to chronic rheumatiſm ſo frequently the effect of the acute.</p>
               <p>In that low fever, which HUXHAM has ſo well deſcribed under the title of nervous, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the cold infuſion of the red Bark with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, where the ſkin hath been ſoft, and the pulſe under one hundred and ten.</p>
               <p>In ſuch fevers, it chiefly acts as a cordial in ſupporting the <hi>Vis Vitae,</hi> and for which reaſon I think it may be given with advantage in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of all fevers, even where the ſymptoms on the attack of the diſeaſe were evidently inflammatory.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0129401100:50"/>
               <p>Almoſt every Fever remits in its decline.</p>
               <p>Fevers originally putrid and malignant, as ariſing from <hi>Miaſmata</hi> and putrid vapour, very ſeldom oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this City, they are moſt generally to be found in Fleets and in Camps, and in ſituations where air ſtagnates or where animal bodies are confined in a cloſe place.</p>
               <p>In ſuch fevers, the cure is effected by vomiting and warm cordials, of the laſt is the red Bark in an eminent degree.</p>
               <p>It may be infuſed in wine, which will render its operation more antiſeptic.</p>
               <p>It intimately unites with the ſeveral acids, from which a very favourable operation in ſuch caſes may be expected.</p>
               <p>In the putrid fever, attended with a gangrenous ſore throat, I have in many inſtances experience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the efficacy of Bark, but care ſhould be taken
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0129401100:51"/>not to confound this diſeaſe with the <hi>Angina Mucoſa</hi> of Dr. HUXHAM, or the <hi>Angina Eryſipelatoſa</hi> of Dr. GRANT, diſeaſes, tho' contagious and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Eruptions</hi> on the ſkin, evidently of the moſt inflammatory nature and requiring the uſe of <hi>Evacuations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Petechial Fevers with ſymptoms of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſtrength, I have frequently ſeen the pulſe not much quickened and the animal heat very little increaſed. In ſuch caſes I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the uſe of the red Bark infuſed in Old Hock.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen a Jail Fever with no other diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſymptoms than Petechiae and Debility; the Tongue clean, the pulſe moderate tho' ſmall, and the ſecretions apparently not diſturbed. In that caſe, bliſters on the Extremities, Bark and Wine are the beſt remedies.</p>
               <p>In general we find that Fevers marked with ſymptoms of debility are chiefly found to remit,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0129401100:52"/>and therefore they admit of the uſe of Bark; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Tone and Vigor of the ſyſtem, it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a returning Paroxyſm.</p>
               <p>Fevers of more violent action, ſuch as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate inflammatory, do not remit at leaſt ſo obviouſly, until that action is moderated by Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, ſo that they chiefly remit only in their decline.</p>
               <p>The primary attack of moſt ſevers in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is attended with violent action, which is beſt moderated ſometimes by the prudent uſe of the lancet, but moſt frequently by the <hi>Tart. Emetis</hi> with the infuſion of <hi>Sena</hi> and ſome of the neutral ſalts. All ſevers beginning with a violent <hi>Rigor,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with great heat, require early evacuations, while ſuch as creep on ſlowly and imperceptibly in the beginning, with giddineſs in the head, rather than acute pain, much anxiety and watchfulneſs, tremor and debility, give way to Opiates, Bark, Serpentaria and Wine. Bliſters applied to the arms are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uſeful in keeping up the pulſe, eſpecially if
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0129401100:53"/>the ſkin be ſoft, the tongue and fauces ſufficiently moiſt; much more may be learned by attending to this laſt appearance than is generally known.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary, however, to diſtinguiſh between the dryneſs of the tongue and mouth, as a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the fever, and as ariſing from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a patient ſleeping with his mouth open.</p>
               <p>I hope the obſervations here offered to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic on the ſubject of this invaluable remedy, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all prejudices againſt a Peruvian Bark of a large and coarſer appearance, than is generally employed.</p>
               <p>It is at preſent in very great demand, the difficulty of procuring it will not, I hope, inſtigate Druggiſts and Dealers in the article, to ſubſtitute at any time a ſpurious kind in its room.</p>

                     <p>Our ſituation being in a country not far diſtant from the marſhes, renders the inhabitants more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to intermittent complaints than thoſe of cities and more inland counties; and, I aſſure you, before the uſe of the Red Bark was known, the Ague, from its particular ſtubborneſs, (as we then thought, or what we have ſince obſerved from the want of efficacy in the other Bark,) might be truly called the <hi>opprobrium Medicorum;</hi> but, now I think, that ſtain is entirely removed, for I have not met with one ſingle caſe, where (when I could perſuade the patient to adhere ſteadily to my advice) I have ever found the Red Bark to fail.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0129401100:55"/>
                     <p>The Peruvian Bark, with which I was formerly provided, was of the beſt kind, and always had in the quill; yet, it was even much inferior in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to what ought reaſonably to be expected from it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt knowledge that ever we had of the Red Bark was in <hi>March,</hi> 1781, when a few pounds was ſent us to try its effects; our Druggiſt informed us that it was then in uſe at St. <hi>Bartholomew's Hoſpital,</hi> and was there found effectual. It remained in our houſe till <hi>May</hi> following, when I was attacked with an Ague; I did not at firſt think of trying the <hi>new</hi> Bark, for I gueſſed, by taking of the <hi>old</hi> in great quantity, which would not be diſagreeable to me, that my Ague would ſoon leave me; but, to my great diſappointment, fit ſucceeded fit, without ſhewing the leaſt good effect of the remedy applied. I was then determined to try the <hi>new</hi> Bark; but, finding my Ague ſtubborn I emptied the <hi>Primae Viae</hi> by an Emetic and Carthartic, and immediately, on the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver going off, I took one drachm of the Red Bark in fine powder, mixed with three ounces of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and a ſmall quantity of the tincture, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0129401100:56"/>being a draught well loaded with Bark, at firſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſit uneaſy on the ſtomach; (which I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times on being firſt taken, found the caſe with ſome of my patients, but which never took from its effect,) but, after reſting for ſome time, I found myſelf in a ſtate to continue its uſe. My Ague from that time kept off; till, from omitting the Bark two ſoon, (and finding myſelf quite well) in a few weeks after, ſlight ſymptoms appeared again; but, which never formed a direct fit, the Bark being again repeated, eradicated the diſorder.</p>
                     <p>My father, now in the 70th year of his age, has ſince that time been attacked with an Ague; but, from his having been before ſeized with a chillineſs without ſubſequent ſever, ſuffered himſelf to have three fits without trying any remedy: being then convinced of the reality of the Ague, applied to this Bark in decoction, with ſome tincture made of the ſame; he found it ſo effectual, that after taking it, the fit did not once return; he omitted the Bark too ſoon, and had one ſlight fit; but, after repeating
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0129401100:57"/>the ſame remedy a few days, it has not ſince return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he is now perfectly well.</p>
                     <p>The patients, who have received immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the <hi>new</hi> Bark, are ſo numerous, that I cannot with any degree of certainty gueſs the number.</p>
                     <p>The quantity that we have uſed, from <hi>July,</hi> 1781, to the preſent time, is upwards of ſixty pounds. The manner in which we have uſed it, with a view to prevent the return of an approaching paroxyſm, is by giving ½ a drachm or 1 drachm of the Powder, mixed with two ounces of the decoction, and a ſmall quantity of the tincture. The decoction we have uſed, has been prepared by boiling three ounces of the groſs powder boiled in two quarts of water to one quart. When the patient has been of a more delicate frame, or when it has been uſed as a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borant, we have given the decoction and tincture without the powder. When the Ague has been but recently contracted, we have ſeldom truſted to any thing but the Bark, but when ſtubborn, evacuants
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0129401100:58"/>have been firſt given; half an ounce of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has very frequently cured an Ague without evacuants, or more Bark, when the fit was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent one; we have now entirely left off giving the <hi>old</hi> Bark in any form ſince we have found ſo good effects from the Red Bark, and we uſed the Reſin of Red Bark with good ſucceſs, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes, where the Patient could take it only in the form of Pills. I heartly hope the above account will prove ſatisfactory to you, if not I ſhall think myſelf very happy in anſwering at any time any future enquiries.</p>

                     <p>I AM ſorry it is not in my power to ſend you particular Caſes of the effects of the Red Bark. Having made no memorandums, I can only ſay, in general, that it is a much better Kind of Bark, than any I have been able to procure hitherto. Whether the Intermittents have been worſe than common, or the Grey Bark has been of inferior Quality, I will not take upon me to determine; but we were all unuſually foiled in our attempts to cure that Complaint, till we were furniſhed with the <hi>New</hi> Bark. I can have no Inducement to give a higher Character of this Drug, than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: but, I do aſſure you, that, ſince I began to uſe it, it has not once failed me, when the Patient has taken it in a proper manner. Hence, I have a firm perſuaſion of its ſuperior efficacy, and I am the more confirmed in my Opinion, by knowing that my Sentiments correſpond with yours,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0129401100:60"/>and with thoſe of all my medical acquaintance, in this Neighbourhood, who have made trial of it. My beſt wiſhes attend your publication; not only becauſe I am perſuaded it will operate to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Mankind, by extending the knowledge and uſe of this valuable Medicine, but, likewiſe becauſe I am in hopes it will haſten a freſh Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the Article, of which I have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle left, and I know not where to go for a ſupply.</p>

               <head>In addition to the character given of the Red Bark, by ſeveral practitioners in the country, is a letter I received a few days ago from Sir WILLIAM BISHOP, an eminent Surgeon, at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> dated <hi>June</hi> 16th.</head>
               <p>IN which he ſhews, by a variety of caſes, that in the cure of intermittents, in that part of the world, the Red Bark had not only been infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more effectual than the common Peruvian Bark, or any other remedy uſually employed, but that it had radically cured where cold bathing, eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, opiates, bitters and friction failed, and where the beſt Pale Bark, both by itſelf, and with a variety of other medicines, was exhibited without effect, even to the quantity of ſixteen ounces. The form he gives it in, is that of an electuary, with the addition of a ſmall quantity of the eſſential oil of pepper-mint and caraway-ſeed; and he ſeldom has occaſion, he ſays, to uſe more than from 4 to 6 ounces. One caſe he mentions, where a ſphacelus had taken place
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0129401100:62"/>in a malignant fever, accompanied with delirium and every other bad ſymptom, the patient was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the uſe of the Red Bark, Anodynes, and Wine; the ſphacelus ſeparating kindly, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and bad ſymptoms ſpeedily gave way.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>I am likewiſe favoured with another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Sir WILLIAM BISHOP, dated <hi>June</hi> 23d, which contains many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and judicious hints upon this ſubject.</head>
               <p>HE recommends the grinding Red Bark into the fineſt powder by a mill, and afterwards ſifting it through the fineſt cypreſs ſieve, in order that it may ſit lightly on the ſtomach, and that its parts may be uniformly blended together: he obſerves, that if, after breaking the Bark, you examine the broken pieces, by means of a glaſs in the ſun ſhine, you will ſee the reſin like ſpangles of gold between the internal woody fibres and the outward grey coat; by comparing this appearance with the beſt Pale
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0129401100:63"/>Bark, you will diſcover that the Red Bark contains a much larger quantity of reſinous parts.</p>
               <p>Two ſcruples of Bark, as coarſly powdered as is commonly fold by the apothecaries, will be as diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to take, as a drachm or four ſcruples finely ground. One drachm is the doſe he generally gave to an adult, although he ſometimes met with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who would chooſe to take two or three drachms at a doſe, and thoſe doſes, at longer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; and from experience he found that, when this laſt practice agreed with the ſtomach, it was the moſt effectual way of curing the intermittent. One patient took three oun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es in twelve hours, and had no return of an obſtinate Quartan.</p>
               <p>Many Intermittents, which could not be cured by ſmall doſes, were removed by larger doſes, more frequently employed.</p>
               <p>He mentions that a period of <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> hours, before the expected return of a <hi>Quotidian,</hi> or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ian</hi> Intermittent, is all that is neceſſary for the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0129401100:64"/>taking a ſufficient quantity of the Red Bark, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obviate the approaching Paroxyſm. Some have been cured by taking <hi>two</hi> ounces, as quick as poſſible after the fit, but ſuch as perſevered in the uſe of it, until <hi>four</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> ounces were taken acted moſt prudently, their health was ſooneſt and moſt perfectly reſtored. He likewiſe obſerves, that ſuch Perſons ought to take the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bark, whoſe blood is in the moſt diſſolved ſtate, and where the fibres have been relaxed by the moſt profuſe ſweating, which frequently takes place in obſtinate <hi>Quartans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quotidians</hi> require but a ſmall quantity, <hi>Tertians</hi> will yield to fewer doſes than our <hi>Kentiſh Quartans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He found it better to get down <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> ounces of Bark, in eight or ten days, than to allow a larger time for the ſame quantity. Labouring people, who work out of doors in cold foggy mornings, either in marſhy grounds or wet lands, from ſun rife till the dew of the evening, and who ſweat profuſely, and ſuffer their wet linen to dry on their backs, will not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0129401100:65"/>be ſafe from a return of the quartan fever, with leſs than five ounces taken after the laſt fit, as the good effects of all they had taken before, are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably carried off and diſſipated in the enſuing paroxyſm.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe obſerves that the Bark in large doſes will not cure the irregular fits of an ague and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which ſo often afflicts perſons, when matter is forming in the lungs, in the <hi>Phthiſis Pulmonalis.</hi>

                        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I AM much pleaſed, that you have undertaken to give us an account of the Red Peruvian Bark. A Publication upon that ſubject, cannot fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good effects, by removing the prejudices of ſome, the ignorance of others, and ultimately by exciting our merchants to obtain liberal ſupplies of a medicine ſo truly valuable. The univerſal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of intermittent fevers this ſpring gave us a large experience of its effects. We have not many intermittents in the town of Birmingham; but, in other parts of the county of Warwick, in Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Shropſhire, Worceſterſhire and Oxfordſhire, ſo far as my rides extend, they have been more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral than ever known before in the memory of the oldeſt practitioners I have converſed with.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0129401100:67"/>
                     <p>After taking pains to recommend the Red Bark to all the Apothecaries I met with, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not leſs anxious to learn their obſervations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to its effects, I can ſay that they unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur in aſſerting <q>"that they have never been diſappointed in their expectations when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited it to Patients labouring under Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Intermittents which I have ſeen, have pretty generally aſſumed the Tertian Type in light ſoils, and the Quartan Type in clayey countries. Of the latter, I have had the care of ſome which were from 6 to 18 Months duration, originating in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex.</hi> I have known two inſtances only of Quartans in which the Red Bark did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a recurrence of the Fits; I ſaw one of theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients afterwards; he laboured under Hepatic and anaſarcous ſymptoms, theſe were removed in a fortnight by the uſual methods, and then the Bark effected a cure. The other caſe was at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance from this place, and I have not yet learnt its termination.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0129401100:68"/>
                     <p>It will require ſome farther experience to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>neceſſary</hi> doſes. I know ſome practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners who have given one or two drachms every four hours betwixt the fits, but I have never had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to give more than thirty or forty grains at ſimilar intervals of time.</p>
                     <p>As to its preparations I can ſay but little; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring always in my own practice the ſimple pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but, I am told, that it makes a very rich tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and, I have ſeen decoctions of it very high coloured and turbid.</p>
                     <p>But it may be aſked—would not the common or Quill Bark, have produced ſimilar good effects in the intermittents of the preſent year? From the reports of other practitioners; I believe it would not. From my own experience, I can give no other anſwer, to ſuch a queſtion, than, by ſaying, that after frequent and almoſt continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, from the uſe of common Quill Bark, I have not tried to cure a ſingle intermittent with it for more than ſeven years paſt; relying en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0129401100:69"/>upon the uſe of evacuants, opium and metallic ſalts. To render this laſt aſſertion reconcilable to the daily experience of others, it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that with us, a Phyſician is ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in fevers of the intermittent kind, unleſs ſome unuſual appearance, or ſome uncommon obſtinacy in the recurrence of the attack, alarms the patient or his friends.</p>
                     <p>Whether the medicine in queſtion, be the product of the ſame tree from which the Quill Bark is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, may be difficult to determine, but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it is the medicine that was uſed by MORTON and SYDEN<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>M, or its efficacy could never have been ſo proverbial. I know not what could firſt induce the writers upon the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Quill Bark; but, I know if you were to aſk an <hi>Engliſh Tanner,</hi> whether the Bark from the trunk; or, that from the twigs of the Oak is the ſtrongeſt, he would laugh at your ignorance.</p>
                     <p>I communicated the contents of your letter, to my worthy friend and colleague Dr. ASH, together
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0129401100:70"/>with my opinion upon the ſubject: he authoriſes the to ſay that the reſult of his experience perfectly coincides with mine.</p>

                     <p>SINCE we have uſed the Red Peruvian Bark, we have had great ſucceſs in curing Agues and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fevers. Theſe diſorders returned ſo frequently after the uſe of the beſt Peruvian Bark, which we could formerly procure that our credit, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0129401100:72"/>well as that of the medicine, began to fail very much, and numbers of our patients got into the hands of perſons unacquainted with phyſic. They ſeemed willing to truſt rather to <hi>noſtrums</hi> and <hi>charms,</hi> than to a medicine which they have ſeen ſo repeatedly fail, and to the effects of which they very ingeniouſly aſcribe every ache and pain which continue after Agues, or which are the conſequences of Agues when imperfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>I could give a very ample detail of the inefficacy of the common Bark; but, as the complaint is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it would be unneceſſary. I ſhall therefore, only take the liberty to preſent you with the more agreeable hiſtory of a few caſes that have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately yielded to the Red Peruvian Bark, and that even when given in very moderate doſes, after having obſtinately reſiſted large quantities of the other.</p>
                     <p>RICHARD PARSLEY, a hard working young man, about 28 years of age, was ſeized with an Ague laſt autumn; which continued either as a <hi>Quotidian,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0129401100:73"/>Tertian</hi> or <hi>Quartan,</hi> with very little intermiſſion, till the 20th of <hi>April</hi> laſt, when I ſaw him accidentally. He gave me the following account. That he had taken every thing that had been recommended to him; and that his maſter, a worthy and reſpectable gentleman in this neighbourhood, had procured him the advice of different practitioners of phyſic, who had preſcribed Bark for him in large quantities, but without benefit, as the diſorder always returned with greater violence after it had been check'd a few Days. He added, that the laſt medicine, which he had been adviſed to take, was half an ounce of alum boiled in a pint of ale, to half a pint, which he was ordered to repeat three different times, as ſoon as he felt the Ague approach. He had in this way, he ſaid, taken ſeven half ounces upon the approach of as many different fits of the Ague.</p>
                     <p>I ſuſpected, that ſo large a quantity of alum, taken at one doſe, muſt have produced ſome dangerous effects, and doubted whether he had ſwallowed the whole of it; but, I ſound upon more particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that he really ſwallowed half an ounce each
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0129401100:74"/>time; as he ſays, that he ſtirred it up from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and felt it gritty in his Teeth. It gave him great pain in his ſtomach. So large a quantity of Alum being taken at one doſe, without materially injuring the ſyſtem, is a fact, which I am perſuaded you will think worthy of notice.</p>
                     <p>I took compaſſion upon this poor Fellow, and ſent him 8 papers of the Red Peruvian Bark, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a drachm in each, which he finiſhed in two intermediate days, the diſorder being then a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. It is now ſeven weeks ſince he took this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and he has had no return of the complaint, but to uſe an expreſſion of his own "hath felt ever ſince as if he had a new Inſide."</p>
                     <p>ANNE PIGOT, a poor Girl 14 years old, has been afflicted with an Ague ſince Autumn laſt in the ſame Family with PARSLEY, and has alſo tried va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious medicines without effect. I preſcribed ſmall doſes of the <hi>Vitriolum Coerul.</hi> fourteen days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gaining any advantage. I gave her alſo 3 or 4 doſes of a hot aromatic powder recommended
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0129401100:75"/>by Van SWIETEN conſiſting of Bay Berries and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Pepper which I have frequently ſeen to cure, but ſhe found no benefit from it. I cannot ſay whether this Girl had given the common Bark a fair trial. She begged to have ſome of the ſame medicine that cured her Relation, and about a month ſince had three papers, containing only one ſcruple in each, and, I aſſure you, ſhe has been perfectly free from the complaint ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>Mr. BARNS, a very ſtrong hard working Man, was ſeized laſt Autumn with a very violent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fever, attended with Delirium, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently much danger. After three or four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxyſms I removed the diſorder by giving him one drachm of the beſt common Peruvian Bark every Hour, and continuing the ſame quantity twice a day afterwards; but, at the end of fourteen days, the Fever return'd with the ſame violence as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was again ſtop'd by the ſame quantity of Bark. From Autumn till the beginning of laſt <hi>April,</hi> it returned in this manner (at the end of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0129401100:76"/>about fourteen days from the time it was ſtopped) five or ſix times and always with uncommon violence. The common Peruvian Bark newly powdered was repeatedly given.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> I preſcribed ſix doſes, of the Red Peruvian Bark, of one drachm each, which he took upon the going off of the <hi>Paroxyſm,</hi> and I have the pleaſure to inform you, that, he has had no return ſince that time; though I no longer uſed the precaution of continuing the daily uſe of the ſame medicine.</p>
                     <p>It is not worth while to mention common caſes, where the Red Bark hath cured without the other having had the trial. A few have occurred, and I have not yet had any inſtance of a relapſe.</p>
                     <p>I was lately called to a very ſevere caſe, like that of Mr. BARNES, where the intermiſſion was not longer than 6 or 8 hours. I preſcribed, and the patient took 6 drachms of the Red Bark, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting the paroxyſm, which came at the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0129401100:77"/>expected hour; and during the ſickneſs and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripilatio the Bark ſeemed to be entirely rejected by vomiting; however the ſucceeding paroxyſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated ſomething of its fury. My patient was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely averſe to Bark in every ſhape; but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him, during the following intermiſſion, I got him to ſwallow two drachms at once, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him ſo entirely averſe to the medicine, that he would take no more afterwards. However, to his great joy, and my ſurpriſe, the ſever left him. He aſcribes his cure to three or four draughts of camphorated julep, which were preſcribed as a <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebo</hi> upon his refuſing to perſevere in the uſe of the Bark. But it may with more juſtice be aſcribed to the two drachms of Red Bark, taken at one doſe; as I think the firſt ſix were in a great meaſure loſt.</p>
                     <p>I conſider the Red Peruvian Bark as a valuable acquiſition to the <hi>Materia Medica:</hi> or, perhaps it may be only a reſtoration of what was uſed in the days of SYDENHAM, and ſome time after, when it was common for medical writers to ſay, that this, or that medicine would cure, with as much certainty as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0129401100:78"/>Bark would an Ague. An eulogium to which the Bark in this country has not been of late years entitled.</p>
                     <p>Before I became acquainted with the ſuperior efficacy of the Red Peruvian Bark, I had tried a variety of <hi>tonics,</hi> with very indifferent ſucceſs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but now and then with very happy effects, ſuch as the <hi>Cuprum Ammoniacum, Vitriolum Coeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum, Sal Vitrioli, Sal Martis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>WILLIAM KING, an athletic young man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me laſt autumn, on account of a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous irregular intermittent, complicated with acute fixed pain in the ſide, and a full ſtrong pulſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much cough and hoarſeneſs. Under theſe circumſtances, I thought it imprudent to adminiſter the Bark in any Form and had recourſe to a plentiful bleeding, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying bliſters to the part affected, and giving the <hi>Decoct. Taraxac.</hi> with <hi>Tart. Solubile,</hi> and honey in large quantities. The diſorder was clearly an Ague; but attended with ſymptoms that threatened a pulmonary conſumption. His blood was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0129401100:79"/>ſizy, which induced me to make uſe of <hi>veneſection</hi> four times, which with the above medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and a very ſtrict <hi>antiphlogiſtic</hi> regimen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the cough and pain in the ſide, though the Ague ſtill continued. I ventured at laſt to give him eight doſes of common Bark, one drachm in each, which removed the Ague ſeveral weeks, and mended his habit much. A continuance of the Bark, twice a day, for ſometime after the Ague ſtopped, brought on a frequent bleeding at the noſe.</p>
                     <p>The Ague returned twice during the winter; but gave way ſoon to the ſame Bark, and he kept tolerably well till the ſetting-in of cold north-eaſt winds in ſpring, when his Ague again returned, and brought with it the pain in the ſide, a bloated icteric countenance, much hoarſeneſs and cough. After one more bleeding and the uſe of the <hi>Apozem</hi> for a month, I gave him ſix drachms of the Red Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Bark in <hi>April</hi> laſt, and have had the pleaſure to ſee him continue free from the Ague ſince that time, though be never repeated the doſe after it ſtopped.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0129401100:80"/>
                     <p>I was unwilling to perſiſt in the uſe of the Bark after the Ague ſtopped leſt it ſhould encreaſe the circulation too much and again excite a bleeding at the noſe.</p>
                     <p>I have now indeed almoſt entirely laid aſide the cuſtom of perſevering in the uſe of the Bark after the intermittent is ſtopped. I have for ſometime ſuſpected that it anſwers no good purpoſe, and that it may poſſibly now and then be the reaſon why large quantities of good Bark have been given in vain. It is a well known Fact, that every species of intermittent complaint frequently returns in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days after being interrupted by means of Bark, notwithſtanding that medicine is continued every day. May not the daily uſe of Bark ſo habituate the conſtitution to its effect as to render it uſeleſs when the Intermittent returns?</p>
                     <p>I am now ſatisfied when I have put a ſtop to the expected paroxyſm, and preſcribe an anodyne to be in readineſs if ever the cold fit returns, adviſing my patient to have recourſe to the ſame quantity of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0129401100:81"/>Bark which he found neceſſary at firſt, and to take it as ſoon as the ſucceeding ſever abates. I adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this practice a little time before I became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſuperior efficacy of the Red Bark, and thought it an improvement, but ſince that time I have ſucceeded ſo well by giving ſix or eight drachms between the paroxyſms that I have ſeldom had occaſion to repeat a ſingle doſe.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>IN anſwer to your obliging requeſt, I ſhall now proceed to lay before you, the beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I can concerning the New Bark, lately intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into practice, under the name of CORTEX RUBER OR RED BARK. As it was found on board a Spaniſh prize intermixed with a ſmall quantity of common Peruvian Bark, it would ſeem to be no other than the produce of the trunk or large branches of the ſame tree. It ſeems to be poſſeſſed of the ſame ſenſible qualities only in a much higher degree, hence it yields a much larger proportion of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous extract, and gives a more ſaturated tincture, and decoction than the common Bark. Hence too I have found (according to what you lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) that the decoction may be expoſed a long time to the open air, without contracting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of acidity, which manifeſtly takes place in that of the common Bark in a few days.</p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0129401100:83"/>
                     <p>It has been remarked for many years paſt, that the Peruvian Bark has often diſappointed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the public; having fallen greatly ſhort of that high degree of efficacy, for which writers of the laſt century, have ſo highly extolled it. Few Phyſicians of extenſive practice, but muſt ſometimes have had the mortification to obſerve their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſpecific entirely baffled by a regular intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, without being able to aſſign any probable cauſe of the defeat, except the <hi>ungenuineneſs</hi> of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; Whence it would ſeem to follow, either that the intermittents of late years, have been more <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> in their nature, or that the Bark has been of an <hi>inferior quality</hi> to that which was uſed by Dr. SYDEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, and many of his reſpectable contemporaries, of whoſe veracity we can entertain no reaſonable doubt. The latter appears to me to be the more probable, eſpecially when it is conſidered that of late years, it has been cuſtomary (for what reaſon I cannot imagine) to ſelect the Bark of the ſmall branches, under the denomination of <hi>Quilled</hi> Bark, in preference to that of the trunks. Should this preference hereafter be diſcovered to have been
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0129401100:84"/>groundleſs, (agreeable to what I have long ſuſpected) it may perhaps contribute to explain the principle cauſe of our diſappointments. In the art of tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, experience has long determined in favour of large Oak Bark, as being greatly preferable to that of the ſmaller twigs. Why the reverſe of this ſhould take place in a medicinal view, is by no means evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, eſpecially if the virtue of the Peruvian Bark keeps pace in any degree with its aſtringency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spaniſh</hi> practitioners, as I have been lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are ſo well convinced of this, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prefer the large Peruvian Bark; ſeparating it from the ſmaller ſort, for all important purpoſes, of which the late capture indeed ſeems to afford a proof.<note n="*" place="margin">This muſt not however be confounded with thoſe coarſe woody flakes, which conſtitute a large proportion of the worſt kind of Bark, now in uſe. For theſe, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been already ſtripped of the outer rind, conſiſt of a mere ligneous ſubſtance diveſted of reſin, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of medioinal virtue.</note> Future obſervations may probably diſcover that this was the real genuine Bark, with which our anceſtors cured all the various kinds of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0129401100:85"/>with a degree of certainty, which now aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes their ſucceſſors.</p>
                     <p>If Bark taken from the large branches ſhould be ſound to be more efficacions than that of the ſmall, is it not reaſonable to believe, that, that of the trunk, or rather of the root, might ſurpaſs both in virtue? Political reaſons, however, reſpecting the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the trees, which produce ſo important an article of commerce, will, it is to be apprehended effectually deter the inhabitants from every experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this nature.</p>
                     <p>A very eminent Druggiſt, who purchaſed a large ſhare of the above cargo, aſſures me, that many of the Apothecaries whom he has ſupplied with the Red Bark, and who have carefully compared its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with thoſe of the common <hi>cortex,</hi> make no ſcruple of deciding in its favour. He further adds that the demand for it has increaſed ſo rapidly of late, that the ſtock in hand is already nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0129401100:86"/>
                     <p>It is to be regretted that the paſſion for interlard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſimple febrifuge with other bitters and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringents (after the uſual mode of practice) but ſtill too much prevails! Under this falſe idea of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its efficacy, its virtue may often be greatly diminiſhed, and at all events, the reſult of the trial muſt be rendered extremely equivocal. In juſtice to the remedy, and to obviate this uncertainty concerning its effects, I have embraced every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity (which ſo ſhort a ſpace would admit,) of adminiſtring it in its ſimple ſtate, without intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with other medicines. The caſes in which I have chiefly tried it, have been low putrid Fevers, attended with extreme proſtration of ſtrength, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium during the evening exacerbations, with ſhort, and obſcure remiſſions in the day time. In one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this kind, <hi>Petechiae</hi> appeared, and were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a <hi>naſal haemorrhage,</hi> which generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the exacerbations, till the patients ſtrength ſeemed to be nearly exhauſted, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with cold ſweats, and involuntary twitchings, &amp;c. His narrow eſcape from this moſt critical ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0129401100:87"/>I attribute to a liberal uſe of this Bark, and aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated liquors drank copiouſly. From its ſucceſs in this, and ſeveral other inſtances, which have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under my own obſervation, I am ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe that it will ſoon become an object worthy of attention, but muſt decline, giving a deciſive opinion concerning its ſuperiority, till I know the reſult of a variety of caſes, in which it is now under trial, and alſo receive additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal confirmation from ſuch correſpondents, as are leſs prepoſſeſſed in its favour than myſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may be ſuppoſed to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore in the interim, I ſhall wait with impatience for your intended publication, hoping that by thus collecting the ſentiments, and obſervations of ſeveral practitioners in different parts of the kingdom, we may at length be enabled to aſcertain the true comparative merit of the <hi>Red Bark,</hi> which cannot but afford great ſatisfaction to the public at large, as well as to,</p>

It may not be improper to add, that I have generally adminiſtred it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from two ſcruples to a drachm, every two hours, except during the paroxyſm or midnight exacerbation, when it has been cautiouſly avoided. Becauſe I have long been convinced by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and attentive obſervation, that the febrile ſymptoms are commonly exaſperated whenever
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0129401100:89"/>common Bark is taken at that period. If the Red Peruvian Bark ſhould be found to anſwer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, and that in ſmaller doſes, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely intereſting to the Patients, and no leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Phyſician eſpecially when he can with confidence pronounce,</p>

               <p>I can not however finiſh without returning my beſt thanks to the Gentlemen who have favoured me with their correſpondence; and I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to expreſs my obligations to many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe letters were too late for publication.</p>
               <p>They all concur in recommending the Red Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian Bark, as more efficacious and powerful than any other kind.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0129401100:90"/>
               <p>From the numerous tryals I have made with it, in Intermittent Fevers, and other diſeaſes, I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conclude that it need be employed only in half the quantity we generally recommend of other Bark.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe the ſatisfaction of aſſuring my Readers, that it is now in general uſe in all the large Hoſpitals in <hi>London;</hi> and, ſuch is the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence given to it, that the demand is difficultly ſupplied.</p>
               <p>Be careful in the choice of it, by attending to the characters which diſtinguiſh it from the large Bark, hitherto rejected by our Druggiſts.</p>
               <p>I ſhall continue to be diligent in my enquiries on the ſubject, and I moſt earneſtly requeſt the favour of my Friends that they will perſevere in ſupplying me with accurate obſervations, ſo as to determine, with preciſion, in what other diſeaſes this valuable remedy may be uſed with ſafety and advantage.</p>
               <p>The operations and effects of remedies can only be aſcertained by the united induſtry and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
