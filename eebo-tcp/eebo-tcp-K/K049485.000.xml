            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF any thing may attone for the Liberty I take in offering this trifle to your Lordſhip, it is, that I will Engage not to be guilty of the Common Vice of Dedications, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give the World an account of the many good qualities they ought to admire in your Lordſhip. I hope I may reckon on it as ſome little piece of merit, in an age where there are ſo many people write Panegyricks, and ſo few deſerve 'em. I am ſure you ought not to ſit for your Picture, to ſo ill a hand as mine. Men of your Lordſhip's Figure and Station, tho Uſeful and Ornamantal to the Age they live in, are yet reſerv'd for the Labours of the Hiſtorian, and the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Poſterity; nor ought to be aſpers'd with ſuch pieces of Flattery while living, as may render the true Hiſtory ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb facs="tcp:1118600200:3"/>
to thoſe that come after. That which ſhould take up all my Care at preſent, is moſt humbly to beg your Lordſhips pardon for Importuning you upon this account; for imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your Lordſhip, (whoſe hours are all dedicated to the beſt and moſt important uſes) can have any leiſure for this piece of Poetry. I beg, my Lord, that you will receive it, as it was meant, a mark of my Entire Reſpect and Veneration.</p>
            <p>I hope it may be ſome advantage to me, that the Town has not receiv'd this Play ill; to have depended meerly upon your Lordſhips good nature, and have offer'd ſomething without any degree of merit, would have been an unpardonable fault, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſo good a Judge. The Play it ſelf, as I preſent it to your Lordſhip, is a much more perfect Poem than it is in the repreſentation on the Stage. I was led into an Error in the writing of it, by thinking that it would be eaſier to retrench than to add: But when I was at laſt neceſſitated, by reaſon of the extreme length, to cut off near ſix hundred Lines, I found that it was maim'd by it to a great diſadvantage. The Fable (which has no manner of relation to any part of true Hiſtory,) was left dark and intricate, for want of a great part of the narration, which was left out in the firſt Scene; and the Chain and Connexion, which ought to be in the Dialogue, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in many other places. But ſince what was omitted in the Acting, is now kept in, I hope it may indifferently Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Lordſhip at an unbending hour. The faults which are moſt generally found, (and which I could be very proud of ſubmitting to your Lordſhip's Judgment, if you can have leiſure for ſo trivial a cauſe,) are, that the Cataſtrophe in the fifth Act is barbarous, and ſhocks the Audience. Some people, whoſe Judgment I ought to have a deference for, have told me that they wiſht I had given the latter part of the ſtory quite another turn; that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> and <hi>Ameſtris</hi> ought to have been preſerv'd, and made happy in the Concluſion of the Play; that beſides the ſatisfaction which the Spectators would have had to have ſeen two Vertuous (or at leaſt Innocent) Characters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded and ſucceſsful, there might have been alſo a more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Inſtructive Moral drawn that way. I muſt confeſs if this be an Error, (as I perhaps it may,) it is a voluntary one
<pb facs="tcp:1118600200:4"/>
and an Error of my Judgment: Since in the writing I actually made ſuch a ſort of an Objection to my ſelf; and choſe to wind up the ſtory this way. Tragedies have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, I know, to be written both ways very beautifully. But ſince Terror and Pity are laid down for the Ends of Tragedy, by the great Maſter and Father of Criticiſm, I was always inclin'd to fancy, that the laſt and remaining Impreſſions, which ought to be left on the minds of an Audience, ſhould proceed from one of theſe two. They ſhould be ſtruck with Terror in ſeveral parts of the Play, but always Conclude and go away with Pity, a ſort of regret proceeding from good nature, which, tho an uneaſineſs, is not always diſagreeable, to the perſon who feels it. It was this paſſion that the famous Mr <hi>Otway</hi> ſucceeded ſo well in touching, and muſt and will at all times affect people, who have any tenderneſs or humanity. If therefore I had ſav'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> and <hi>Ameſtris,</hi> I believe (with ſubmiſſion to my Judges) I had deſtroy'd the greateſt occaſion for Compaſſion in the whole Play. Any body may perceive, that ſhe is rais'd to ſome degrees of happineſs, by hearing that her Father and Husband are living, (whom ſhe had ſuppos'd dead,) and by ſeeing the Enemy and Perſecuter of her Family dying at her feet, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the turn of her death may be more ſurprizing and pitiful. As for that part of the Objection, which ſays, that Innocent perſons ought not to be ſhewn unfortunate; The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and general approbation, which many of the beſt Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that have been writ, and which were built on that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have met with, will be ſufficient anſwer for me.</p>
            <p>That which they call the Poetical Juſtice, is, I think, ſtrictly obſerv'd, the two principal Contrivers of Evil, the Stateſman and Prieſt, are puniſh'd with death; and the Queen is depos'd from her authority by her own Son; which, I ſuppoſe, will be allowed as the ſevereſt mortification that could happen to a woman of her Imperious temper.</p>
            <p>If there can be any excuſe for my Entertaining your Lordſhip with this <hi>Detail</hi> of Criticiſms, it is, That I would have this firſt mark of the honour I have for your Lordſhip appear with as few faults as poſſible. Did not the prevailing Character of your Lordſhip's Excellent humanity and good nature encourage
<pb facs="tcp:1118600200:5"/>
me, what ought I not to fear from the niceneſs of your Taſte and Judgment? The delicacy of your reflexions may be very ſatal to ſo rough a Draught as this is; but if I will believe, (as I am ſure I ought to do) all men that I have heard ſpeak of your Lordſhip, they bid me hope every thing from your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is that I muſt ſincerely own, which made me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Ambitious of your Lordſhip's Patronage for this Piece. I am but too ſenſible, that there are a multitude of faults in it; but ſince the good nature of the Town has cover'd, or not taken notice of 'em, I muſt have ſo much diſcretion, as not to look with an affected nicety into 'em my ſelf. With all the Faults and Imperfections which it may have, I muſt own, I ſhall be yet very well ſatisfied with it, if it gives me an opportunity of reckoning my ſelf from this time,</p>
