            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <speaker>SIR GEORGE.</speaker>
                     <p>AND ſo, Darnley, you prefer this ſolitary life, to all the joys of London—to be ſure you've a nice ſnug Villa, and a charming wife here—but its dull—the ſcene tires—it wants variety, Harry.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Darnley.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir George.—Since I retir'd to this peaceful ſpot, I have not had a wiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it: I've been ſo happy in that humble cottage, that when I'm doom'd to leave it, the world will be a waſte, and life not have a charm!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir George.</speaker>
                     <p>How you are alter'd, Darnley? When we were brother officers you were the greateſt rake in the regiment; but from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0584101200:9"/>time we were quarter'd at Worceſter, where you firſt beheld Miſs Dormer—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Darnley.</speaker>
                     <p>I ſaw the folly of my former life; I own'd the power of her ſuperior charms, and leaving a buſy and tumultuous world, retir'd with her to this ſequeſter'd ſcene—'tis now three years ſince I married.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir George.</speaker>
                     <p>And from that time to this, have you liv'd in this out-of-the-way place?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Darnley.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: and till you yeſterday honour'd me with a viſit, I have not ſeen a friend within my doors—but isn't it a happy life, Sir George? Our affections have room to ſhoot—care and diſtruſt are baniſh'd from our cottage, and with ſuch a woman as Mrs. Darnley to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, what is the world to me? I can defy and ſcorn its malice.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir George.</speaker>
                     <p>She's an angelic creature indeed, Darnley: and at Worceſter, I had myſelf near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen a victim to her charms; but about your future life—do you mean to live for ever in theſe woods and meadows?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Darnley.</speaker>
                     <p>No—would to heaven I could!—I fear I muſt forego my preſent calm, and mix in active life again: When I married, I ſold my commiſſion, you remember, to purchaſe this ſmall farm—Mrs. Darnley's portion was but a trifle, and an encreaſing family has ſo enlarg'd my expences, that unleſs I return to the army—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir George.</speaker>
                     <p>Ah—you want to be raking again?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Darnley.</speaker>
                     <p>No—I want to ſecure an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for my family—I want to ſee my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren affluent, and to attain this, I have once more applied to my uncle Sir Paul Perpetual,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0584101200:10"/>who was ſo offended at my ſelling out, that he has ever ſince abandon'd me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir George.</speaker>
                     <p>What—does the old beau ſtill perſevere in his reſentment?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Darnley.</speaker>
                     <p>His anger has encreas'd; for he writes me word; he intends marrying Lady Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Savage, on purpoſe to have heirs more worthy his eſtate:—Oh! my friend:—'tis hard, that fortune ſhould beſtow ſuch treaſures, and then compel me to deſert them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir George.</speaker>
                     <p>So it is: but now I think on't, this Lady Sarah Savage and her brother are my intimate friends; and as you are their neighbours, I'll introduce you and Mrs. Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley to their notice—When are they expected from town?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>Then we'll pay them a viſit: Lady Sarah Savage ſhall interfere with your uncle, and if that fails, her brother can eaſily enſure your promotion in the army—but ſee; here's Mrs. Darnley?</p>

                     <p>Why, with our young men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, quizzing is a ſubſtitute for wit, my dear; ſo one man challeng'd me to play on the violin, and when I roſe to move my elbows, another whip'd the chair from under me; a ſecond put hot coals into my pocket, ſo when I felt for my hankerchief, I burnt my fingers; a third tried to cut off my tail, but that aſſaſſin I purſued, when unluckily in running after him, they had tied a ſtring acroſs the ſtairs, and I pitch'd headforemoſt into a <hi>barrel</hi> of water, they had placed for the purpoſe.</p>
