            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was towards the latter End of the Reign of Queen ANNE that I wrote Remarks upon the firſt hundred Lines of the late Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Homer,</hi> upon the <hi>Windſor Foreſt,</hi> upon the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> and upon the infamous <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> provok'd and urg'd to it by the Folly, the Pride, and the Petulancy of that little Gentleman <hi>A. P-E</hi>; Qualities which at that Time made me foreſee and foretell, that there was no Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever whom he apprehended to be above him, whether by Station, Power, or Merit, but he would come impudently one Day to fly in his Face, if timely Care were not taken to chaſtiſe and correct his ſoaring Inſolence.</p>
            <p>It was in the Beginning of the Reign of the late KING that I order'd three of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Treatiſes to be publiſh'd, <hi>viz. Remarks</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0506900800:7"/>
on the <hi>Tranſlation of Homer,</hi> on <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Foreſt,</hi> and on the <hi>Temple of Fame</hi>; which was done with a Deſign to hold a faithful Glaſs to this little Gentleman, and to cure him of his vain and his wretched Conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by giving him a View of his Ignorance, his Folly, and his natural Impotence, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled Cauſes of ſo many Errors and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Imperfections.</p>
            <p>But at the ſame Time that I order'd three of them to be publiſh'd, I took care to keep back the enſuing Treatiſe purpoſely <hi>in Terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi>; which had ſo good an Effect, that he endeavour'd for a time to counterfeit Humility and a ſincere Repentance: And about that Time I receiv'd a Letter from him, which I have ſtill by me, in which he acknowledg'd his Offences paſt, and expreſs'd an hypocritical Sorrow for them.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner did he believe that Time had caus'd theſe Things to be forgot, than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd into ten times the Folly and the Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ever he had ſhewn before. He not only attack'd ſeveral Perſons of far greater Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than himſelf, but, like a mad <hi>Indian</hi> that runs a muck, ſtruck at every Thing that came in his Way, without Diſtinction of Friend or Foe, Acquaintance or Stranger, Merit or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, Wiſdom or Folly, Vice or Virtue; like a blind Beetle, that in its blundering Flight bruiſes itſelf againſt every Object it meets, and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0506900800:8"/>
does not fail to knock itſelf down by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Blows which it gives to others.</p>
            <p>He has not only ſtruck at very different Perſons, without any manner of Diſtinction, but has thrown his rhetorical Flowers, of Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, Scoundrel, promiſcuouſly at them all; as if he wiſely thought, that he was the only foul-mouth'd Fellow in <hi>England,</hi> or had ſo much of the Fool, Blockhead, Dunce, Scoundrel within him, that they have the ſame Effect on his Mind that Jaundice would have upon his Eyes, and make every Thing without him be to him in Appearance, what in Reality is within him.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more eaſy than to give foul Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which a Fool is more capable of giving to a wiſe Man, than a wiſe Man to a Fool; becauſe nothing incapacitates a Man ſo much for it as good Senſe, good Nature, good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and common Diſcretion; and nothing qualifies a Man more for it, than his being a Clown, a Fool, a Barbarian, and a Brute. The calling a Man Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel, if it does not find him ſo, it does by no means make him ſo. But if it does not find him ſo, it gives him who calls him ſo, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Title to thoſe Terms himſelf. As this is the Language of the Rabble of Mankind, the more any one brings himſelf to uſe it, the more he ſets himſelf upon an infamous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with the Scum and Off-ſcouring of Things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0506900800:9"/>
Before I take my leave of this Subject, I cannot help reminding this little Gentlemen, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> that tho' his Adverſaries were as many Fools, Blockheads, Dunces, as he is pleas'd, in Hononr to them, to call them; yet is he moſt unjuſt, and moſt ungrateful, to reflect upon any Perſons for their Want of Capacity: ſince 'tis to People who want Underſtanding that he owes moſt of his little Fortune and all his little Reputation. For I will venture to affirm, that Mr. <hi>A. P-E</hi> has no Admirers among thoſe who have Capacity to diſcern, to diſtinguiſh, and judge; and I will venture to foretell, that Time will make this Affirmation good.</p>
            <p>Not but that I am oblig'd in Juſtice to own, that there are ſeveral Perſons of very great Merit who ſubſcrib'd to his Tranſlation of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>; but then they were Perſons moſt of them who were induc'd to expect a very different Performance to what they found: And ſome were importun'd and teaz'd into that Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome were drawn in by their Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to their Friends, and others ſacrific'd their Judgment to their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The calling a Man of the beſt Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, is the eaſieſt Thing in the World (as we obſerv'd above) to him who is really all this himſelf: But for ſuch a one to prove what he ſays, is abſolutely impoſſible. Therefore in the Remarks above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, upon the Tranſlation of <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0506900800:10"/>
upon <hi>Windſor-Foreſt,</hi> upon the <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> I have given none of theſe Appellations to the little facetious Gentleman at whom thoſe Pieces were levelled; but then I have prov'd in them, by convincing Reaſon and by undeniable Fact, that he has a greater Right to the Poſſeſſion and Property of them than any other Perſon in <hi>Great Britain</hi> whatever. I have ſhewn that he was equally a Stranger to the Character, the Language, and the Meaning of <hi>Homer</hi>; that nothing qualify'd him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Liſts againſt Sir <hi>John Denham,</hi> but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Stupidity; and that the <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> will, as long as 'tis remember'd, be to <hi>A. P-E</hi> the <hi>Temple of Infamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I propoſe to do the ſame Thing in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Remarks. I ſhall call him neither Fool, nor Dunce, nor Blockhead; but I ſhall prove that he is all theſe in a moſt egregious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 'Tis juſtly obſerv'd by the Duke of <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,</hi> 
               <q>That a Man may be a very great Fool notwithſtanding his <hi>Wit</hi>; but that he never can be ſo if he has <hi>Judgment</hi>: For <hi>Imagination</hi> is common to Man with Beaſts, but he enjoys <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with God and Angels.</q> The impartial Reader, who knows the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> and who will read the following <hi>Remarks,</hi> will be able to determine whether <hi>A. P-E</hi> has ſhewn one Dram of Judgment, either in the Choice of this trifling <hi>Subject,</hi> or of his more ſenſeleſs <hi>Machinery,</hi> or in the <hi>Manners</hi> and
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0506900800:11"/>
               <hi>Behaviour</hi> of his fine Lady, who is ſo very rampant, and ſo very a Termagant, that a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Hundreds of <hi>Drury</hi> would be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chaſtis'd, if ſhe had the Impudence in ſome Company to imitate her in ſome of her Actions. The impartial Reader is to determine whether the <hi>Sentiments</hi> are not often exceeding poor, and mean, and ſometimes ridiculous; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Diction</hi> is not often impure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatical.</p>
            <p>But if the Author has not ſhewn one Dram of Judgment in the Piece that has been ſo much applauded by Readers more light than the Subject, what ſhall we ſay of the inſipid <hi>Profund?</hi> What ſhall we ſay of the fulſome <hi>Dunciad?</hi> Were they not writ in perfect Spight to good Senſe, to Decency, to Juſtice, to Gratitude, to Friendſhip, to Modeſty? And can ſuch a Creature as this be deſerving of the noble Name of a POET, the Name and the Function which he has ſo much blaſphem'd? Nay, can he deſerve even the Name of a Verſifyer, whoſe Ear is as injudicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhing as the reſt of his Head? The Commendation which <hi>Taſſo</hi> ſo juſtly and ſo judiciouſly gives to <hi>Lucretius,</hi> is, <hi>Nobiliſſimo Verſificatore,</hi> a <hi>moſt noble Verſifyer:</hi> For <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> knew all the Variety, the Force, and the Power of Numbers; ſo that his Harmony in ſome Parts of him has never been ſurpaſs'd, not even by <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf. But <hi>A. P-E</hi> has none of theſe diſtinguiſhing Talents, nor
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0506900800:12"/>
Variety, nor Force, nor Power of Numbers, but an eternal Monotony. His <hi>Pegaſus</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a batter'd <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Jade, that neither ambles, nor paces, nor trots, nor runs, but is always upon the <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and as he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mends, never ſlackens his Pace, but when he ſtumbles or falls. So that having neither Judgment nor Numbers, he is neither Poet nor Verſifyer, but only an eternal Rhimer, a little conceited incorrigible Creature, that like the Frog in the Fable, ſwells and is angry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not allow'd to be as great as the Ox.</p>
            <p>But if Judgment, Reaſon, and Numbers are wanting to his Rhimes, if we take a View of his proſaick Rhapſodies, 'tis there a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe: Not only Judgment and Reaſon are wanting there; but Veracity, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, Honour, and Faith are wanting. <hi>A. P-E</hi> ſets up for a Knight of the Poſt, a frank Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit-Man of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> falſifies Matter of Fact at Pleaſure, and invents the baſeſt Calumnies, to expoſe Men of Senſe to Fools. In the Height of his Profeſſions of Friendſhip for Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> he could not bear the Succeſs of <hi>Cato,</hi> but prevails upon <hi>B. L.</hi> to engage me to write and publiſh Remarks upon that Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Which after I had done, <hi>A. P-E,</hi> the better to conceal himſelf from Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> and his Friends, writes and publiſhes a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pamphlet, equally fooliſh and villainous, in which he pretends that I was in the Hands
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0506900800:13"/>
of a Quack who cures mad Men. So weak is the Capacity of this little Gentleman, that he did not know that he had done an odious Thing; an Action deteſted even by thoſe whom he fondly deſign'd to oblige by it. For Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was ſo far from approving of it, that he engag'd Sir <hi>Richard Steele</hi> to write to me, and to aſſure me that he knew nothing of that Pamphlet till he ſaw it in Print, that he was very ſorry to ſee it, and that whenever he ſhould think fit to anſwer my Remarks on his Tragedy, he would do it in a manner to which I ſhould have no juſt Exception. Thus Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> acted like a Man of Honour, and like one who foreſaw what he himſelf had to expect from a Wretch who was capable of ſo much Baſeneſs. What he foreſaw and expected happen'd: <hi>A. P-E</hi> libell'd him in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript while he liv'd, and in Print after he died.</p>
            <p>'Tis a ſure Sign that we live in a poor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning, degenerate World, when one who has writ and acted as this little Gentleman has done, has been able to delude it ſo long. But as he got ſuch Favours by ungenerous Arts, he has work'd himſelf out of it, by his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his Baſeneſs, by which he has made, by a modeſt Computation, a <hi>Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Enemies, and rais'd Indignation and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain in the Breaſt of every generous and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Reader. He has not only attack'd ſuch Numbers of People at one Time as no one

before him ever did in any Nation or any Age, but has groſly abus'd ſeveral very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Men; and ſome of them for no other Reaſon but becauſe they had ſhewn an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Diſcernment, and a Sagacity greatly ſuperior to his own: Among whom I am oblig'd, in Juſtice, to name Mr. <hi>Theobald,</hi> who by delivering <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> from the Injuries of Time, and of lazy, or ignorant and ſtupid Editors, has oblig'd all who are concern'd for the Reputation of ſo great a Genius, or for the Honour of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was for no other Reaſon that he has libell'd Mr. <hi>Theobald,</hi> Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> and ſeveral others, than that they have ſurpaſs'd him. He has been ſo far from making that Diſtinction which he ought to have done, that his Malice has been levell'd moſt at thoſe who have moſt Merit; which is a certain Proof, that this little envious Creature knows nothing of the Nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which can never exiſt where the Cenſures are not juſt. In that caſe the Verſifyer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Satiriſt, is a Lampooner, an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Libeller. None of the antient Satiriſts, neither <hi>Horace,</hi> nor <hi>Perſius,</hi> nor <hi>Juvenal,</hi> ever attack'd Merit: And <hi>Boileau</hi> declares, <q>That Merit is always precious to him; and that he has a greater Eſteem for <hi>Patru</hi> in the midſt of Indigence, than for one who has amaſs'd the greateſt Treaſure by baſe and unjuſtifiable Means.</q> He did not only ſay this, but ſhew'd, by a very generous Action, that it was his real
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0506900800:15"/>
Sentiment. <hi>Patru</hi> had a very noble Library, conſiſting of a great Number of Volumes, and all of them very well choſen. He was reduc'd by his Circumſtances to part with this Library, in order to ſatisfy his Creditors. <hi>Boileau</hi> hearing of this, came and paid down the full Price for it, and never remov'd a Volume, but gave <hi>Patru</hi> the Enjoyment of the whole during the Remainder of his Life.</p>
            <p>But the little Gentleman, who wrote the <hi>Dunciad</hi> and the <hi>Profund,</hi> does not only, with infinite Baſeneſs, reproach Authors with Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who have deſerv'd a thouſand times better both of their Country and the Commonwealth of Learning, to both which he is an open and a mortal Enemy; but he has the Impudence to infer their Want of Merit from their Want of Fortune. At this rate, <hi>Spencer,</hi> the renowned Lord <hi>Bacon, Butler,</hi> and <hi>Otway</hi> were Dunces; and <hi>A. P-E,</hi> and <hi>Ned Howard,</hi> and two or three rich and noble Lords, are Poets and great Wits. At this rate <hi>Horace</hi> too was a Dunce, becauſe he was not only poor, before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and his firſt Miniſter caſt a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Eye upon him, but his Poverty made him a Poet. Such is the Account that he gives of himſelf in the ſecond <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Book</hi> II.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quem dimiſêre Philippi</l>

If <hi>Horace</hi> was poor, <hi>Virgil</hi> was not rich, before the ſame magnanimous Prince, and his wiſe and diſcerning Miniſter, took him into their Protection. Yet he was ſo far from contemning Poverty, that he rather had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for Riches: Witneſs what he makes <hi>Evander</hi> ſay to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in the 8th <hi>Aeneid,</hi> when he introduces him into the homely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace where <hi>Hercules</hi> had lain before.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And in his Praiſe of a Country-Life, at the latter End of the ſecond <hi>Georgic,</hi> he ſeems to make Poverty the Foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This I will venture to ſay, that there never was a great Poet in the World but he had a Contempt for Riches. Of which Opinion likewiſe is <hi>Horace:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—Vatis avarus</l>
               <l>Non temere eſt animus, verſus amat, hoc ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det unum.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And there never was a little Poetaſter, but he lov'd them, valu'd himſelf upon the Poſſeſſion of them, and did baſe Things to acquire and to augment them.</p>
            <p>Nothing can ſhew any one more weak or more baſe, than to prefer Fortune to Merit, or vainly and vilely to endeavour to extol Fortune and to decry Merit. God has given extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Merit to few, but he has ſubjected all to the Viciſſitudes of human Affairs, as well as to Diſeaſes
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0506900800:18"/>
and Death. The greateſt and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Monarchs are not exempted from the Power of Fortune, that is, from the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and irreſiſtible Decrees of Providence: Nay, the greater and more powerful any one is, the more deplorable Misfortunes is he ſubjected to. And therefore the Calamities of the Great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſupply the fitteſt Subjects for ſo noble a Poem as Tragedy.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the Viciſſitude of human Affairs, Men of the greateſt Fortune and Power ought not to value themſelves upon either: But for this little Gentleman to ſtrut and be conceited upon his having a Hundred a Year, to pretend to look down upon thoſe whom he never had Capacity to look up to; to call their good Senſe and their Reaſoning Railing, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are his Talent; to ſay he will anſwer what they urge againſt him when he is as much <hi>in Debt</hi> as they are, at the ſame time that he owes his little Subſtance to a <hi>vile Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of a <hi>poor</hi> but <hi>excellent</hi> Poet, who if he was not <hi>in Debt,</hi> it was becauſe no Body would truſt him: To do all this, entertains the Publick with the moſt ridiculous Farce in the World. Notwithſtanding this, as long as he writes ſo ſcandalouſly as he has lately done, in ſo degenerate an Age he will not be without Readers: For all Fools are fond of Scandal, becauſe all Fools are Levellers. But for the ſame Reaſons that he has their Approbation, he is contemn'd by Men of ſound Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>

And now I appeal to every impartial ſenſible Reader, who ſhall have read this, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remarks, and who has formerly read thoſe upon <hi>Homer, Windſor-Foreſt,</hi> and the <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> if I have not prov'd, both by convincing Reaſon and by undeniable Fact, That <hi>A.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHALL now, according to my Promiſe, ſend you ſome <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> upon the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> which is one of the laſt Imitations of the little mimicking Bard, and one of the moſt impertinent; to ſo high a Degree impertinent, that I am afraid of being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0506900800:21"/>
accus'd of writing a <hi>Satire</hi> upon <hi>Nothing,</hi> as my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> wrote a <hi>Panegyrick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Faults of this ridiculous Poem begin at the Title-Page. I will not inſiſt upon the fantaſtical Compoſition of the Word <hi>Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Comical</hi>; but I deſire Leave to dwell a little upon the Thing. What can this Author mean by creating in his Readers an Expectation of Pleaſantry, when there is not ſo much as one Jeſt in his Book? Of all Blockheads he is the moſt emphatically Dull, who, to an inſipid tedious Tale, prefixes this impertinent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude; <hi>Now, Gentlemen, expect a very good Jeſt! Now, my Maſters, prepare to laugh!</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Heroi-Comical,</hi> it ſhould have been <hi>Heroi Tragical,</hi> ſince it ſeems there was a Neceſſity for a fantaſtical Word: For there is a great deal of <hi>Tragedy</hi> in this Poem, but not one Jot of <hi>Comedy.</hi> But at the ſame Time there is nothing ſo <hi>Tragical</hi> in it, as what the Author <hi>deſigns</hi> for <hi>Comedy:</hi> For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he aims at a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> 'tis ſuch ſad deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stuff, that he never fails to move <hi>Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>But now, Sir, to paſs from the <hi>Title-Page</hi> to the <hi>Dedication</hi>; he need not have been at the Trouble of acquainting his fair Patroneſs, that he publiſh'd what he calls his <hi>Poem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had thought of what he calls his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery:</hi> For the Book would have told her that, without the Epiſtle. For what he calls
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0506900800:22"/>
his <hi>Machinery</hi> has no Manner of Influence upon what he calls his <hi>Poem,</hi> not in the leaſt promoting, or preventing, or retarding the Action of it; as we ſhall ſhew more plainly when we come to treat of the <hi>Machines.</hi> He has taken his <hi>Machines,</hi> he tells us, from the <hi>Roſycrucians</hi>; and 'tis with them, he tells his fair Patroneſs, that he muſt bring her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. And how bring her acquainted? Why, he muſt tell her what the Count <hi>de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balis</hi> ſays of them, who has given, it ſeems, the beſt Account that he knows of them. If he had not too much Pride, the natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequence of his Capacity, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; (for my Lord <hi>Roſcomon</hi> is certainly in the Right, when he tells us, that</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Pride, of all others, the moſt dang'rous Fault,</l>
                  <l>Proceeds from Want of Senſe, or Want of Thought:)</l>
               </q>
               <p>I would direct him to a better Account of them, which is to be found in a Writer of our own, who is infinitely a better Judge both of Perſons and Things, than the fantaſtick Count <hi>de Gabalis:</hi> and That is the moſt ingenious and moſt judicious Author of <hi>Hudibras,</hi> who has given this ſhort Account of the <hi>Roſycrucians,</hi> in his Comment upon two Lines which are to be found in the Character of <hi>Ralpho,</hi> the facetious Squire of <hi>Hudibras, Canto</hi> I. <hi>Part</hi> 1.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0506900800:23"/>
and which two I have choſen for the Motto to theſe <hi>Letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>In <hi>Roſycrucian</hi> Lore as learned</l>
                  <l>As he that <hi>verè Adeptus</hi> earned.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The ſhort Comment upon which is this:</p>
               <q>The Fraternity of the <hi>Roſycrucians</hi> is very like the Sect of the antient <hi>Gnoſtici</hi>; who called themſelves ſo from the excellent Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they pretended to, although they were really the moſt ridiculous Sots of all Mankind.</q>
               <p>And then upon the Words <hi>Verè Adeptus,</hi> ſays he,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verè Adeptus</hi> is one who has commenc'd in their Phanatick Extravagance.</q>
               <p>Thus, if we will believe <hi>Butler,</hi> who, as we ſaid before, is an admirable Judge both of Books and of Mankind, this judicious Author of the <hi>Rape</hi> has taken what he calls his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery,</hi> from the <hi>Phanatick Extravagance</hi> of the moſt ridiculous of all modern Sots; as their Predeceſſors the <hi>Gnoſtici</hi> were the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ones of all the Antient; a Sect that is as becoming of this <hi>merry little Gentleman,</hi> as it was of the facetious Squire of <hi>Hudibras.</hi> And now tell me in good Earneſt, Sir, is not the <hi>Fair Lady</hi> infinitely oblig'd to him for her new Acquaintance?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0506900800:24"/>
an Acquaintance very <hi>unbecoming Her,</hi> tho' very <hi>becoming</hi> of <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, have I done with the <hi>Title-Page</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> I ſhall proceed to Morrow upon the Body of the Book. In the mean time I will aſſure you for your Comfort, that you ſhall never have a Letter of above a Sheet of Paper at a Time upon this <hi>impertinent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> I am, Sir,</p>

                  <hi>Butler</hi> modeſtly calls his <hi>Poem,</hi> by the Name of his Hero, <hi>Hudibras</hi>; and without endeavouring to prepoſſeſs his Reader, leaves the <hi>Poem</hi> itſelf to work its natural Effect upon him.</p>
               <p>But now, Sir, ſince I have ſaid that the <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi> ſeems to be writ in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lutrin,</hi> (I mean ſo far in Imitation, that the Author had a Mind to get Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by writing a great many Verſes upon an <hi>inconſiderable Subject,</hi> as <hi>Boileau</hi> appears to have done before him;) I believe it will not be diſagreeable to you, if I ſhew the Difference between the <hi>Lutrin</hi> and this <hi>fantaſtick Poem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi> is a very <hi>empty Trifle,</hi> without any <hi>Solidity</hi> or <hi>ſenſible Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; whereas the <hi>Lutrin</hi> is only a <hi>Trifle</hi> in

                  <hi>Appearance,</hi> but under that Appearance car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a very grave and very important Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For if that <hi>Poem</hi> were only what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be, <hi>Boileau</hi> would run counter to the <hi>fam'd Rule</hi> which he has preſcrib'd to others.</p>

Now ſince 'tis impoſſible that ſo judicious an Author as <hi>Boileau</hi> ſhould run counter to his own, and to the Inſtructions of his Maſter <hi>Horace,</hi> the <hi>Lutrin</hi> at the Bottom cannot be an <hi>empty Trifle.</hi> 'Tis indeed a noble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſatirical Poem, upon the Luxury, the Pride, the Diviſions, and Animoſities of the Popiſh Clergy. 'Tis true indeed the <hi>admirable Addreſs</hi> of the Poet has made it in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance a <hi>Trifle</hi>; for otherwiſe it would not have been ſuffer'd in a bigotted Popiſh Country. But yet <hi>Boileau</hi> in ſome Places ſeems to have given broad Hints at what was his real Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as in the following Paſſage.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>La Deeſſe en entrant, qui voit la nappe miſe,</l>
                  <l>Admire un ſi bel ordre, &amp; reconnoit l'egliſe.</l>
                  <bibl>Lutrin, Chant. I.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>And this other Paſſage is ſtill more bold.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Pour ſoutenir tes droits, que le ciel autoriſe,</l>
                  <l>Abime tout plutôt, c' eſt l' eſprit de l'egliſe.</l>
                  <bibl>Lutrin, Chant. I.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>As <hi>the Rape of the Lock</hi> is an <hi>empty Trifle,</hi> it can have no <hi>Fable</hi> nor any <hi>Moral</hi>; whereas the <hi>Lutrin</hi> has both <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi> 'Tis true, indeed, the <hi>Allegory</hi> under which that <hi>Moral</hi> is conceal'd, is not ſo perſpicuous as <hi>Boileau</hi> would have made it, if it had not been for the Apprehenſion of provoking the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0506900800:28"/>
Clergy. But, on the other Side, 'tis not ſo obſcure, but that a penetrating Reader may ſee through it. The Moral is, <hi>That when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and eſpecially the Clergy, run into great Heats about religious Trifles, their Animoſity proceeds from the Want of that Religion which is the Pretence of their Quarrel.</hi> The Fable is this; <q>Two Perſons being deſerted by true Piety, are embroil'd about a religious Trifle, to the Perplexity and Confuſion of them and theirs: Upon the Return of Piety, they agree to ſet aſide the Trifle about which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and are reconcil'd, to the Quiet and Satisfaction both of themſelves and their Partizans.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If you will be pleaſed to compare the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Sixth <hi>Canto</hi> with the reſt of the Poem, you will eaſily ſee that this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I have given of the <hi>Lutrin</hi> is not without Foundation. But you know very well, Sir, that there is not the leaſt Shadow of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Fable in the <hi>Rape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As nothing could be more ridiculous than the writing a full, an exact, and a regular Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm upon ſo empty a Buſineſs as this trifling Poem; I will ſay but a Word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Incidents,</hi> and ſo have done with what relates immediately to the <hi>Deſign.</hi> The Intention of the Author in writing this Poem, as we find in the Title-Page, is to raiſe the Mirth of the Reader; and we find by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which <hi>Hudibras</hi> and the <hi>Lutrin</hi> produce
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0506900800:29"/>
in us, that <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Boileau</hi> wrote with the ſame Intention. Now you know very well, Sir, that in a Poem which is built upon an Action, Mirth is chiefly to be rais'd by the <hi>Incidents.</hi> For Laughter in <hi>Comedy</hi> is chiefly to be excited, like Terror and Compaſſion in Tragedy, by Surprize, when Things ſpring from one another againſt our Expectation. Now whereas there are <hi>ſeveral</hi> ridiculous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents in the <hi>Lutrin,</hi> as, The Owl in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit frighting the nocturnal Champions; The Prelate's giving his Benediction to his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by way of Revenge and Inſult; The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the Bookſeller's Shop, &amp;c. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are a thouſand ſuch in <hi>Hudibras</hi>; There is not ſo much as <hi>one,</hi> nor the <hi>Shadow of one,</hi> in the <hi>Rape of the Lock:</hi> Unleſs the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Friends will object here, That his <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Gravity,</hi> after the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of his Title, makes the whole Poem one continued <hi>Jeſt.</hi>

               <p>I COME now to the <hi>Characters</hi> and the <hi>Machines.</hi> The Characters in the <hi>Lutrin</hi> are well mark'd. They are the true Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of Men, of active Men, who purſue earneſtly what they are about. But there is no ſuch Thing as a Character in the <hi>Rape of the Lock. Belinda,</hi> who appears moſt in it, is a Chimera, and not a Character. She is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Author perfectly <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>well-bred, modeſt</hi> and <hi>virtuous.</hi> Let us now ſee how he ſuſtains theſe Qualities in her, and then we ſhall diſcover what Taſte he has of <hi>Nature</hi> and of <hi>Decorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then he repreſents her perfectly <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sol</hi> thro' white Curtains did his Beams diſplay,</l>
                  <l>And op'd thoſe Eyes which brighter ſhone than they.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And thus in the next Page the Sylphs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt her:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0506900800:31"/>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Faireſt of Mortals, thou diſtinguiſh'd Care</l>
                  <l>Of thouſand bright Inhabitants of Air.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And yet in the latter End of this very <hi>Canto</hi> he makes her owe the greater Part of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to her Toilette:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Unnumber'd Treaſures ope at once, and here</l>
                  <l>The various Offerings of the World appear;</l>
                  <l>From each ſhe nicely culls with curious Toil,</l>
                  <l>And decks the Goddeſs with the glitt'ring Spoil,</l>
                  <l>This Casket <hi>India</hi>'s glowing Gems unlocks,</l>
                  <l>And all <hi>Arabia</hi> breathes from yonder Box.</l>
                  <l>Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms,</l>
                  <l>The Fair each Moment riſes in her Charms,</l>
                  <l>Repairs her Smiles, awakens every Grace,</l>
                  <l>And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face,</l>
                  <l>Sees by Degrees a purer Bluſh ariſe,</l>
                  <l>And keener Lightnings quicken in her Eyes.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Nay, the very <hi>favourite Lock,</hi> which is made the Subject for ſo many Verſes, is not ſhewn ſo deſirable for its native Beauty, as for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Artifice employ'd about it. Witneſs what <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> ſays to <hi>Belinda</hi> juſt after ſhe had loſt it:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Was it for this you took ſuch conſtant Care</l>
                  <l>The Bodkin, Comb, and Eſſence to prepare?</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0506900800:32"/>
For this your Locks in Paper Durance bound,</l>
                  <l>For this with torturing Irons wreath'd around?</l>
                  <l>For this with Fillets ſtrain'd your tender Head,</l>
                  <l>And bravely bore the double Loads of Lead?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Such Artifice muſt deface the Luſtre of Locks which were naturally lovely; and the Toilette muſt of Neceſſity detract from perfect Beauty. The Toilette indeed may add to ſome who are call'd Beauties, or to ſome who would be thought ſuch. A decay'd ſuperannuated Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may receive Advantage from her Toilette, may <hi>riſe</hi> in her Charms, and by the Help of <hi>Spaniſh Red,</hi> a <hi>purer Bluſh may ariſe.</hi> But her <hi>counterfeit Charms</hi> can pleaſe none who have a Taſte of <hi>Nature</hi>; according to that of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Heu ſerò revocatur amor, ſeròque juventa,</l>
                  <l>Cum vetus infecit cana ſenecta caput.</l>
                  <l>Tum ſtudium formae eſt, coma tùm mutatur ut annos</l>
                  <l>Diſſimulet, viridis cortice tincta nucis.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But for her who has Youth and Beauty;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Illa placet quamvis, inculto venerit ore,</l>
                  <l>Nec nitidum tardâ compſerit arte caput.</l>

Such a one wants neither <hi>Flounce</hi> nor <hi>Furbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> nor <hi>torturing Irons,</hi> nor <hi>Paper Durance.</hi> When God and Nature deſign a Face to pleaſe, the Fair-one, on whom they beſtow it, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver add to Workmanſhip Divine. She may ſpoil it indeed by Induſtry, but can never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. They, who made it, alone know the certain Ways of going to the Heart of Man, and alone can give it thoſe reſiſtleſs inimitable Graces which Induſtry does but ſpoil, and which Artifice does but hide.</p>

                  <hi>Horace</hi> was as fond of his Miſtreſs's Hair as any modern Lover can be: Witneſs what he ſays to <hi>Maecenas</hi> in the twelfth Ode of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book;</p>

               <p>And yet as he and the reſt of the antient Poets had an admirable Taſte of Nature, they had quite another Taſte of Beauty than what this Author diſcovers; and believ'd that the brighteſt Ornament, either of the Hair or Face, was Simplicity and a becoming Negligence.</p>

                  <hi>Terence,</hi> who every where ſo exactly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Nature, takes a quite different Courſe from this Author to ſhew a touching Beauty. The Paſſage is in the firſt Act of his <hi>Phormio:</hi>

               <q>
                  <l>Virgo pulchra! &amp; quo magis diceres,</l>

               <p>Here was no Care, neither of Hair, nor Face, nor Shape, and yet how much more charming does this <hi>Terentian</hi> Virgin appear, ev'n in Rags and Miſery, than <hi>Belinda</hi> does at her Toilette?

               </q>
               <p>And our Ladies who ſpend ſo much Time at their Toilettes would do well to conſider, that, after all the Pains which they take in adorning themſelves, they who are moſt charm'd with their Perſons, endeavour to retrieve their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beauty in Imagination at leaſt, by diveſting them of their borrow'd Ornaments, and cloathing them in the Simplicity of the rural Habit, when in their Sonnets they transform them to Shepherdeſſes.</p>
               <p>But the Author has not only ſhewn <hi>Belinda</hi> an accompliſh'd <hi>Beauty</hi>; he repreſents her likewiſe a fine, modeſt, <hi>well-bred</hi> Lady:</p>

Muſt not this be the legitimate Offspring of <hi>Stentor,</hi> to make ſuch a Noiſe as that?

               <p>Well, but his Friends will object here, that this is an <hi>Hyperbole</hi>; and an Hyperbole is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to carry us beyond the Truth, only that it may make us enter more juſtly into it: and that when <hi>Virgil</hi> ſays of <hi>Camilla,</hi>

                  <l>Illa vel intactae ſegetis per ſumma volaret</l>

                  <l>Vel mare per medium fluctu ſuſpenſa tu menti,</l>
                  <l>Ferret iter, celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas;—</l>
               </q>
               <p>He means only that <hi>Camilla</hi> was exceeding ſwift of Foot: Why, be it ſo. But then by the ſame Rule, muſt not the Author of the <hi>Rape</hi> mean, that <hi>Belinda ſhouted</hi> and <hi>roar'd</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0506900800:37"/>
very loud; and that, in ſhort, ſhe made a <hi>diabolick Din?</hi> Now is <hi>Shouting</hi> and <hi>Roaring</hi> proper for a well-bred Lady? Are they not below the Modeſty and the Decency even of thoſe <hi>ſonorous</hi> Nymphs of the Flood, who haunt the Banks of the vocal <hi>Thames</hi> between the <hi>Bridge</hi> and the <hi>Tower?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us look once more upon the laſt <hi>Canto, p.</hi> 44. Is ſhe not a terrible <hi>Termagant</hi> there, and the exact Reſemblance of <hi>Magnano</hi>'s Lady in <hi>Hudibras?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>ACcording to the Promiſe made in my laſt, I am now to treat of the <hi>Machines</hi>; in the doing which I ſhall lie under a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage: For before I come to thoſe of the <hi>Rape,</hi> it is neceſſary to ſay ſomething of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> in general, of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, of the <hi>Method</hi> us'd by the antient Poets in employing them, and of the <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> of the greateſt and beſt of the Moderns.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0506900800:39"/>
'Tis neceſſary to ſay ſomething to all theſe, in order to ſhew the Abſurdity of our Author's <hi>Machines,</hi> and his utter Ignorance of the Art he pretends to. But to treat of all theſe in as ample a Manner as the Subject deſerves, would require a Volume: And on the other Side, it would be extravagant to ſpend a great deal of Time to ſo inſignificant an End. But when I conſider that I write to a Gentleman who is perfectly well vers'd in theſe Matters, and who conſequently will comprehend a great deal by a little, I find to my Comfort that it will be eaſy to avoid both thoſe Inconveniences, of ſaying a great deal, and of ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons, that firſt oblig'd thoſe Poets which are call'd Heroic to introduce <hi>Machines</hi> into their <hi>Poems,</hi> were,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To make their <hi>Fable</hi> and their <hi>Action</hi> more inſtructive: For, ſays <hi>Boſſu,</hi> 
                  <q>Lorſque les poetes ſont devenus philoſophes moraux, ils n' ont pas ceſſé d'etre theologiens. Au con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire, la morale quils traitent, les oblige indiſpenſablement, de méler la divinité dans leurs Ouvrages; parceque la conoiſſance, la crainte, &amp; l' amour de Dieu, en un mot, la piete, &amp; la religion ſont les premiers, &amp; les plus ſolides fondements, des autres vertus, &amp; de tout la morale.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By introducing Machines into their Fables, the Epic Poets ſhew'd two Things, 1. That the great Revolutions in human Affairs are influenc'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0506900800:40"/>
by a particular Providence. 2. That the Deity himſelf promotes the Succeſs of an Action form'd by Virtue, and conducted by Prudence. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Heroic Poets introduc'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> into their Fables in order to make thoſe Fables more <hi>delightful:</hi> For the employing <hi>Machines</hi> made the Actions of thoſe Poems <hi>wonderful</hi>; now every Thing that is <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> is of courſe <hi>delightful.</hi> Let us ſee what one of the greateſt Maſters among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns ſays to this:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Qu' Aenee &amp; ſes vaiſſeaux par les ventes ecartez,</l>

                  <l>C' eſt la ce qui ſurprend, frappe, ſaiſit, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tache,</l>

Sans tous ces ornamens le vers tombe en lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueur</l>

                  <l>Le poete n'eſt plus, qu'un orateur timide</l>

               <p>This ſays the moſt judicious M. <hi>Deſpreaux</hi> in his <hi>Art of Poetry</hi>; and the four laſt Lines remind me here of what I have at large diſcours'd upon other Occaſions, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Epic Poets by their <hi>Machines</hi> made the <hi>Actions</hi> of their Fables more <hi>wonderful</hi> and more <hi>delightful,</hi> as well as more <hi>inſtructive</hi>; they likewiſe made the <hi>poetical Expreſſion</hi> more <hi>wonderful</hi> and more <hi>delightful,</hi> ſince 'tis from them that they chiefly derive that Greatneſs of Expreſſion which renders their Works ſo Divine.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to the Practice of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Poets, and the Method which they made uſe of in introducing their <hi>Machines,</hi> in order to render their Poems more <hi>inſtructive</hi> and more <hi>delightful.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. They took their <hi>Machines</hi> from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their Country, upon which Account theſe <hi>Machines</hi> made the ſtronger Impreſſion, and made their Fables, and the Actions of them, <hi>probable</hi> as well as <hi>wonderful</hi>; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more natural than for thoſe antient Heathens to believe that the Powers which they ador'd were wont to intermeddle in human
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0506900800:42"/>
Affairs, and to promote the Succeſs of thoſe Deſigns which they favour'd; and nothing could be more natural for them, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that that Deſign muſt proſper which was eſpous'd by <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But this was not all; for the <hi>Machines,</hi> by making the Actions of their Poems <hi>probable,</hi> made them <hi>wonderful</hi> to Men of Senſe, who never can admire any Thing in Humanity which <hi>Reaſon</hi> will not let them believe. But,</item>
                  <item>2. The antient Poets made their <hi>Machines</hi> allegorical, as well as their human Perſons.</item>
                  <item>3. They oppos'd them to one another.</item>
                  <item>4. They ſhew'd a juſt Subordination among them, and a juſt Proportion between their Functions. While one was employ'd about the greateſt and the ſublimeſt Things, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not buſied about the moſt trifling and moſt contemptible.</item>
                  <item>5. They always made their <hi>Machines</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Actions of their Poems; and ſome of thoſe <hi>Machines</hi> endeavour'd to <hi>advance</hi> the Action of their reſpective Poem, and others of them endeavour'd to <hi>retard</hi> it.</item>
                  <item>6. They made them infinitely more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the human Perſons.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But, Secondly, The Practice of the greateſt modern Heroic Poets is conformable to that of the antient.</p>

                  <item>1. They take their <hi>Machines</hi> from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their Country; witneſs <hi>Milton, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Taſſo.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. They make them Allegorical.</item>
                  <item>3. They oppoſe them to one another.</item>

               </list>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Rape</hi> has run counter to this Practice both of the Antients and Moderns. He has not taken his <hi>Machines</hi> from the Religion of his Country, not from any Religion, nor from Morality. His Machines contradict the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, contradict all ſound Morality; there is no allegorical nor ſenſible Meaning in them; and for theſe Reaſons they give no Inſtruction, make no Impreſſion at all upon the Mind of a ſenſible Reader. Inſtead of making the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wonderful and delightful, they render it extravagant, abſurd, and incredible. They do not in the leaſt influence that Action; they neither prevent the Danger of <hi>Belinda,</hi> nor promote it, nor retard it, unleſs, perhaps, it may be ſaid, for one Moment, which is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. And if here it be objected, that the Author deſign'd only to <hi>entertain</hi> and <hi>amuſe</hi>; To that I anſwer, That for that very Reaſon he ought to have taken the utmoſt Care to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0506900800:44"/>
make his Poem <hi>probable,</hi> according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Precept of <hi>Horace.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Ficta voluptatis cauſâ ſint proxima veris.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And that we may be ſatisfy'd that this Rule is founded in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> we find by conſtant Experience, that any thing that ſhocks <hi>Probability</hi> is moſt inſufferable in Comedy.</p>
               <p>There is no Oppoſition of the <hi>Machines</hi> to one another in this <hi>Rape of the Lock. Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> the <hi>Gnome</hi> is not introduc'd till the Action is over, and till <hi>Ariel</hi> and the Spirits under him, have quitted <hi>Belinda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no juſt <hi>Subordination</hi> among theſe <hi>Machines,</hi> nor any juſt <hi>Proportion</hi> between their <hi>Functions. Ariel</hi> ſummons them together, and talks to them as if he were their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>

                  <l>And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Day.</l>
                  <l>Some guide the Courſe of wandring Orbs on high,</l>
                  <l>Or roll the Planets thro' the boundleſs Sky—</l>

Or brew fierce Tempeſts on the watry Main,</l>
                  <l>Or o'er the Glebe diſtil the kindly Rain.</l>
                  <l>Others on Earth o'er human Race preſide,</l>
                  <l>Watch all their Ways, and all their Actions guide:</l>
                  <l>Of theſe the Chief the Care of Nations own,</l>
                  <l>And guard with Arms Divine the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now, Sir, give me leave to ask you one Queſtion: Did you ever hear before that the Planets were roll'd by the aerial Kind? We have heard indeed of Angels and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences who have perform'd theſe Functions: But they are vaſt glorious Beings, of <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Kind, and <hi>Machines</hi> of another Syſtem. Pray which of the <hi>aerial</hi> Kind have theſe <hi>ſublime</hi> Employments? For nothing can be more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, or more contemptible, than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of thoſe whom he harangues</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To ſave the Powder from too rude a Gale,</l>
                  <l>Nor let th' impriſon'd Eſſences exhale.</l>
               </q>
               <p>There is a Difference almoſt infinite between theſe vile Functions and the former ſublime ones, and therefore they can never belong to Beings of the ſame Species. Which of the aerial Kinds are the Movers of Orbs on high, or the Guardians of Empires below; when he who calls himſelf their Chief, is only the Keeper of a vile <hi>Iſeland Cur,</hi> and has not ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0506900800:46"/>
much as the Intendance of the Lady's <hi>Favourite Lock,</hi> which is the Subject of the Poem? But that is entruſted to an inferior Spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all manner of Judgment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Machines</hi> that appear in this Poem are infinitely leſs conſiderable than the <hi>human Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> which is without Precedent. Nothing can be ſo contemptible as the <hi>Perſons,</hi> or ſo fooliſh as the <hi>Underſtandings</hi> of theſe <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins. Ariel</hi>'s Speech, for the firſt thirty Lines, is one continu'd Impertinence: For, if what he ſays is true, he tells them nothing but what they knew as well as himſelf before. And when he comes at length to the <hi>Point,</hi> he is full as impertinent as he was in his <hi>Ramble</hi> before; for after he has talk'd to them of <hi>black Omens</hi> and <hi>dire Diſaſters</hi> that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Heroine, theſe Bugbears dwindle to the breaking a Piece of <hi>China,</hi> the ſtaining a <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat,</hi> the loſing a <hi>Necklace,</hi> a <hi>Fan,</hi> or a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Sal Volatile.</hi> But we ſhall conſider this Paſſage further when we come to examine the <hi>Sentiments</hi>; and then we ſhall ſee, that <hi>Sawny</hi> takes the Change here, and 'tis <hi>He,</hi> a little <hi>Lump of Fleſh,</hi> that talks; inſtead of a little <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which makes this Speech more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, is the Place where it is ſpoken, and that is upon the Sails and Cordage of <hi>Belinda</hi>'s Barge; which is certainly taken from the two Kings of <hi>Brentford</hi> deſcending in Clouds, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0506900800:47"/>
ſinging in the Style of our modern Spirits.</p>

They are, indeed, Beings ſo <hi>diminutive,</hi> that they bear the ſame Proportion to the reſt of the intellectual, that Eels in Vinegar do to the reſt of the material World.

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0506900800:48"/>
I ſhall mention but one or two more of the numerous Defects which are to be found in the <hi>Machines</hi> of this Poem; the one is, The Spirits, which he intends for <hi>benign</hi> ones, are <hi>malignant,</hi> and thoſe, which he deſigns for <hi>malignant,</hi> are <hi>beneficent</hi> to Mankind. The <hi>Gnomes</hi> he intends for <hi>malignant,</hi> and the <hi>Sylphs</hi> for <hi>beneficent</hi> Spirits. Now the <hi>Sylphs</hi> in this Poem promote that <hi>Female Vanity</hi> which the <hi>Gnomes</hi> mortify. And Vanity is not only a great Defect in Human Nature, but the Mother of a thouſand Errors, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crimes, and the Cauſe of moſt of the Misfortunes which are incident to Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The laſt Defect that I ſhall take notice of, is, That the <hi>Machines</hi> in this Poem are not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>one Syſtem,</hi> but are <hi>double,</hi> nay <hi>tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> or <hi>quadruple.</hi> In the firſt <hi>Canto</hi> we hear of nothing but <hi>Sylphs,</hi> and <hi>Gnomes,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanders,</hi> which are <hi>Roſycrucian</hi> Viſions. In the ſecond we meet with <hi>Fairies, Genii,</hi> and <hi>Daemons,</hi> Beings which are unknown to thoſe Fanatick Sophiſters. In the fourth, <hi>Spleen</hi> and the <hi>Phantoms</hi> about, are deriv'd from the Powers of <hi>Nature,</hi> and are of a ſeparate Syſtem. And <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Jove,</hi> which we find in the fifth <hi>Canto,</hi> belong to the Heathen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

Where in three Lines there are no leſs than two Errors in the <hi>Sentiments.</hi> For, in the firſt Place, tho' the Author has neither <hi>Fable</hi> nor <hi>general Action,</hi> yet he propoſes to ſing ſomething <hi>general,</hi> rather than that <hi>particular Action</hi> which is the <hi>Subject</hi> of his Poem, and he begins as if he deſign'd to make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der expect a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of Love-Quarrels; which Proceeding is juſt contrary to the Practice of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and to the Dictates of <hi>right Reaſon. Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> had <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Fables,</hi> and their <hi>Actions</hi> at the Bottom were <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>allegorical:</hi> Yet they each of them propos'd to ſing theſe <hi>Actions,</hi> as they had <hi>particulariz'd</hi> them by the Impoſition of Names. <hi>Homer</hi> begins thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Muſe, ſing the baleful Fury of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>And <hi>Virgil</hi> thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Arma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab oris</l>
                  <l>Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit</l>

               </q>
               <p>In the third Line he does not invoke the Muſe to ſing, but propoſes to do it himſelf: And tho' he names the Muſe immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, he does it, forſooth, to acquaint her, that 'tis not ſhe, but <hi>Belinda,</hi> that is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him:</p>

                     </hi> Muſe is due,</l>
                  <l>This ev'n <hi>Belinda</hi> may vouchſafe to view:</l>
                  <l>Slight is the Subject, but not ſo the Praiſe,</l>
                  <l>If ſhe inſpire, and He approve my Lays.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So that he has deſir'd no Aſſiſtance from the <hi>Muſe,</hi> and none ſhe has afforded him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſe</hi> indeed could not poſſibly aſſiſt him in this Caſe. The <hi>Muſe</hi> is a Machine like <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Jove,</hi> belonging originally to the <hi>Ethnic</hi> Syſtem, and transferr'd ſometimes to the Chriſtian Religion only allegorically; and the <hi>Muſe</hi> cannot be ſuppos'd to bring him acquainted with <hi>Roſycrucian</hi> Spirits, which would deſtroy her own Divinity, either as Heathen or Chriſtian, ſince they are Beings utterly unknown, either to the <hi>Ethnic</hi> Syſtem, or to the Chriſtian Religion: So that 'tis <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda,</hi> and not the <hi>Muſe,</hi> that is to inſpire him. He introduces <hi>her</hi> into the Acquaintance of the <hi>Sylphs</hi> and <hi>Sylphids</hi> in his Epiſtle, and ſhe is to bring <hi>him</hi> acquainted with them in the Body of the Book. And now, Sir, is not this very <hi>ingeniouſly,</hi> and very <hi>judiciouſly</hi> contriv'd? He has deſir'd no Aſſiſtance from the <hi>Muſe,</hi> and, as I ſaid before, none he has had from her. The whole Poem ſeems to have been infus'd by a <hi>Coquette,</hi> and not inſpir'd by a <hi>Muſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already acquainted you, Sir, that I would not in the <hi>Examen</hi> of this Poem confine my ſelf to an exact and regular Method: For neither is the Subject worth the while, nor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0506900800:52"/>
ought a Letter to a Friend to be writ with any Reſtraint. I ſhall therefore take the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of this Poem as they come in my way, without pretending to rank them under their reſpective Claſſes, excepting perhaps the <hi>Puns,</hi> which are numerous, and by which the Author fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhocks not only the Dictates of <hi>Good Senſe,</hi> and the Rules of <hi>true Pleaſantry,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>common Engliſh.</hi> But thoſe we ſhall omit till we have done with the reſt.</p>
               <p>There is in this firſt <hi>Canto, pag.</hi> 4. a very unlucky Imitation of a Paſſage in the ſixth Book of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Quae gratia currûm</l>
                  <l>Armorumque fuit vivis, quae cura nitentes</l>
                  <l>Paſcere equos; eadem ſequitur tellure repoſtos.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Which the Author of the <hi>Rape</hi> has thus imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Think not, when Woman's tranſient Breath is fled,</l>
                  <l>That all her Vanities at once are dead,</l>
                  <l>Succeeding Vanities ſhe ſtill regards,</l>
                  <l>And tho' ſhe plays no more o'erlooks the Cards:</l>
                  <l>Her Joy in gilded Chariots when alive,</l>
                  <l>And Love of Ombre, after Death ſurvive.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now there is this remarkable Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Paſſages, that what <hi>Virgil</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0506900800:53"/>
ſays of the Souls in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, that they were pleas'd with the ſame Diverſions after Death, of which they were fond in their Life-times, does by no means contradict any Doctrine of that Religion which the <hi>Romans</hi> deriv'd from the <hi>Grecians</hi>; but the Paſſage in the <hi>Rape</hi> ſhocks the fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, and is therefore a moſt abſurd Imitation.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewn, in ſpeaking of the <hi>Characters,</hi> how injudicious all that Paſſage is, in the 8th and 9th Pages, which relates to the Toilette: And as I do not pretend to ſhew all his Errors, but only ſome few which are very groſs ones, I ſhall now paſs to the ſecond <hi>Canto</hi>; in which <hi>Canto,</hi> pag. 11. there is a Remark that cannot but be the Effect of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>wiſe</hi> and very <hi>deep</hi> Obſervation:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>With hairy Springes we the Birds betray,</l>
                  <l>Slight Lines of Hair ſurprize the finny Prey,</l>
                  <l>Fair Treſſes Man's impertal Race inſnare,</l>
                  <l>And Beauty draws us with a ſingle Hair.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay, <hi>Birds</hi> are caught by the <hi>Heels,</hi> and <hi>Fiſh</hi> by the <hi>Jaws,</hi> with <hi>Horſe-Hair</hi>; and <hi>Men</hi> are hamper'd by the <hi>Souls</hi> with <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Hair.</hi> Tell me truly, Sir, is not this the Effect of very <hi>wiſe</hi> and very <hi>deep</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? I have been ſo taken with theſe four Verſes, that I could not forbear making the four following in Imitation of them.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0506900800:54"/>
                  <l>With jingling Bells Night-Fowlers Birds betray,</l>
                  <l>With theſe Night-Anglers catch the finny Prey:</l>
                  <l>Small Poets hamper Fools by jingling Rhimes,</l>
                  <l>And Nonſenſe draws them by its ſenſeleſs Chimes.</l>
               </q>
               <p>In this ſecond <hi>Canto, pag.</hi> 12. we have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Imitation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and one ten times more unhappy than the former in the firſt <hi>Canto.</hi> The Paſſage of <hi>Virgil</hi> is in the ſecond Book of the <hi>Aeneis:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Dolus, an virtus, quis in hoſte requirit?</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay, If a Captain obtains a Victory, few enquire whether he ow'd it to Stratagem or open Force.</p>
               <p>The Imitation is included in the following Lines:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Th' adventurous Baron the bright Lock admir'd,</l>
                  <l>He ſaw, he wiſh'd, and to the Prize aſpir'd;</l>
                  <l>Reſolv'd to win, he meditates the Way</l>
                  <l>By Force to raviſh, or by Fraud betray:</l>
                  <l>For when Succeſs a Lover's Toil attends,</l>
                  <l>Few ask, if Fraud or Force attain'd his Ends.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now the Miſchief of it is, that if a Lover ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Ends by <hi>Force,</hi> the whole Country makes a very ſevere Enquiry into it, by their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0506900800:55"/>
Repreſentative, a <hi>petty Jury</hi>; and if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be convicted of it, in that Caſe poor Culprit paſſes his Time but ſcurvily.</p>
               <p>In the Letter, which I lately ſent you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Characters,</hi> I mention'd ſeveral of the <hi>Sentiments</hi> which are to be found in <hi>Ariel</hi>'s Speech: But I know not how I omitted that which follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To fifty choſen Sylphs of ſpecial Note</l>
                  <l>We truſt, th' important Charge, the Petticoat:</l>
                  <l>Oft have we known that ſevenfold Fence to fail,</l>
                  <l>Though ſtiff with Hoops, and arm'd with Ribs of Whale.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Where, Sir, 'tis eaſy to obſerve, that as 'tis <hi>Belinda</hi>'s Petticoat of which he commits the important Charge to the Sylphs; 'tis the Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat of the ſame <hi>Belinda,</hi> according to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaning, and all true grammatical Conſtruction, that he has known ſo often to fail in ſpight of the Hoops of Whalebone. And now I leave you to judge if there was not Reaſon for telling Mrs. <hi>Arabella,</hi> in the Epiſtle, that Madam <hi>Belinda</hi> was not like her.</p>
               <p>There ſeems indeed to be a <hi>terrible Shock</hi> made upon the ſame Petticoat, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth <hi>Canto,</hi>
                  <hi> pag.</hi> 42.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>All ſide in Parties, and begin th' Attack,</l>
                  <l>Fans clap, Silks rattle, and tough Whale-bones crack.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0506900800:56"/>
By <hi>tough Whalebones</hi> he cannot mean thoſe of the <hi>Fans,</hi> for they are <hi>limber</hi> enough. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Fans</hi> were mention'd in the Beginning of this laſt Verſe. The <hi>tough Whale-bones</hi> then, at he latter End of it, are thoſe of the <hi>Petticoat,</hi> and could not poſſibly be heard to <hi>crack,</hi> unleſs a <hi>violent Attack</hi> had been made upon it.</p>
               <p>At the Bottom of <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. <hi>Canto</hi> III. there is a very notable Thought:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Coffee, which makes the Politician wiſe,</l>
                  <l>And ſee through all Things with his half-ſhut Eyes,</l>
                  <l>Sent up in Vapours to the Baron's Brain</l>
                  <l>New Stratagems the radiant Lock to gain.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now what was this <hi>new Stratagem,</hi> or theſe <hi>new Stratagems?</hi> Why, the Baron comes <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Belinda</hi> as ſhe was drinking her Coffee, and, ſnap, off goes the <hi>Lock.</hi> Now if this was the <hi>new Stratagem,</hi> what in the Name of <hi>Impertinence</hi> could be the <hi>old one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>profoundeſt</hi> and <hi>wiſeſt</hi> Reflections of all, are at the End of this third <hi>Canto.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>What Time would ſpare, from Steel receives its Date,</l>
                  <l>And Monuments, like Men, ſubmit to Fate:</l>
                  <l>Steel did the Labour of the Gods deſtroy,</l>
                  <l>And ſtrike to Duſt th' imperial Tow'rs of <hi>Troy</hi>

Steel could the Works of mortal Pride confound,</l>
                  <l>And hew triumphal Arches to the Ground.</l>
                  <l>What Wonder then, fair Nymph, thy Hair ſhould feel</l>
                  <l>The conquering Force of unreſiſting Steel?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Why, who the Devil, beſides this Bard, ever made a Wonder of it? What! before <hi>Troy</hi> Town, and triumphal Arches were built, was the cutting off a Lock of Hair a <hi>miraculous</hi> Thing? But we may very properly apply what he ſays of Steel, and the cutting off a Lock of Hair to <hi>Fire,</hi> and the burning of a <hi>Faggot.</hi>

               <q>
                  <l>What Time would ſpare, from <hi>Fire</hi> receives its Date,</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Fire</hi> did the Work of Demi Gods conſume,</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Fire</hi> could the Works of mortal Pride confound,</l>

               <p>THE Complaint which you make of my long Silence, and the Interruption of this <hi>weighty</hi> Affair, ſeems to be a Return to that Compliment which I deſign'd to make you, by diſcontinuing my Obſervations upon theſe arrant <hi>Bawbles.</hi> It was in Complaiſance to you that I began to make them; and it was out of Reſpect to your Judgment that I left them off. They began to run into Length, and I thought I might as reaſonably entertain you with voluminous Remarks upon <hi>Mites</hi> in <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> or upon <hi>Eels</hi> in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> as with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Obſervations on Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Poems.</p>
               <p>But ſince 'tis your Deſire that I ſhould make an end of what I have begun. I am reſolv'd to comply with it, as far as my Indiſpoſition, and my Affairs, and the Satiety which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in ſaying ſo much already, will permit me. For the Difficulty here does not lie in <hi>making Remarks,</hi> but in <hi>Reading.</hi> The Faults are ſo groſs and ſo numerous, that there is no more Pleaſure in finding them, than there is in hunting in a Hare-Warren.</p>

I am now come to the <hi>Sentiments,</hi> which are to be found in the fourth and fifth <hi>Cantos</hi> of this notable Poem. I ſhall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a very few, by which you and your Friends may judge of the whole.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing I ſhall take notice of, is the impertinent Journey of <hi>Umbriel</hi> the <hi>Gnome,</hi> who</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Down to the central Earth, his proper Scene,</l>
                  <l>Repairs to ſearch the gloomy Cave of Spleen.</l>
                  <bibl>Pag. 3.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>Now to what Purpoſe does this fantaſtick Being take this Journey? Why, to give <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> the Spleen. In order to which, <hi>Spleen</hi> equips him with a <hi>Bottle</hi> and a <hi>Bag,</hi> as a Country Dame does her <hi>Plough-Jobber,</hi> to equip him for his Day's Work.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A wondrous Bag with both her Hands ſhe binds,</l>
                  <l>Like that where once <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> held the Winds;</l>
                  <l>There ſhe collects the Force of female Lungs,</l>
                  <l>Sighs, Sobs, and Paſſions, and the War of Tongues.</l>
                  <l>A Viol next ſhe fills with fainting Fears,</l>
                  <l>Soft Sorrows, melting Griefs, and flowing Tears.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now what could be more impertinent than this Journey of <hi>Umbriel,</hi> or more vain and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0506900800:60"/>
uſeleſs than this Gift of <hi>Spleen,</hi> whether we look upon the <hi>Bag</hi> or the <hi>Bottle?</hi>

                  <hi>Umbriel</hi> deſcends to the <hi>central Earth</hi> to give <hi>Belinda</hi> the <hi>Spleen.</hi> Now 'tis plain, that before his Deſcent he leaves her <hi>mad,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Return, finds her in a <hi>Fit of the Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That before his Journey he leaves her <hi>mad,</hi> is I think pretty plain, from <hi>pag.</hi> 28.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Then flaſh'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Screams</hi> of <hi>Horror</hi> rend th' <hi>affrighted</hi> Skies.</l>
                  <l>Not <hi>louder Shrieks</hi> by Dames to Heaven are caſt—</l>
               </q>
               <p>That upon his Return he finds her in a <hi>Fit of the Mother,</hi> is manifeſt from <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Sunk in <hi>Thaleſtris</hi>' Arms the Nymph he found,</l>
                  <l>Her Eyes dejected, and her Hair unbound.</l>
               </q>
               <p>How abſurd was it then for this <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> to take a Journey down to the <hi>central Earth,</hi> for no other Purpoſe than to give her the <hi>Spleen,</hi> whom he left and found in the Height of it? And why does this impertinent Devil, who <hi>ſees</hi> this, give himſelf the Trouble which he takes in the following Lines:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0506900800:61"/>
                  <l>Full o'er their Heads the ſwelling Bag he rent,</l>
                  <l>And all the Furies iſſu'd at the Vent,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Belinda</hi> burns with more than mortal Ire. <bibl>Ibid.</bibl>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>Now, pray, what were the <hi>Furies</hi> enclos'd in this Bag? Why we were told what they were a little higher, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>female Lungs,</hi> and <hi>Bedlam Paſſions,</hi> and the <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Tongues.</hi> Now could <hi>Belinda</hi> have more of thoſe than ſhe had before the <hi>Gnome</hi> took his Journey?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Then flaſh'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes,</l>

               </q>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Bottle,</hi> that ſeems like <hi>Trinca. lo</hi>'s, rather to <hi>comfort</hi> her, than to <hi>ferment</hi> her more. For let us but conſider the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which <hi>Umbriel</hi> found her upon his Return;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Sunk in <hi>Thaleſtris</hi>' Arms the Nymph he found,</l>
                  <l>Her Eyes dejected, and her Hair unbound.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay, ſhe was <hi>ſtark mad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us compare this Condition with that in which ſhe appears after ſhe has a <hi>Dram</hi> of the <hi>Bottle?</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>But <hi>Umbriel,</hi> hateful Gnome, forbears not ſo,</l>
                  <l>He breaks the Viol whence the Sorrows flow.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now, pray, what is the Conſequence? Why <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi> of a ſudden comes to herſelf, holds up
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0506900800:62"/>
her Head, and is calm enough to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
               <p>The next Thing I ſhall take notice of, is the <hi>Equipage</hi> of <hi>Spleen,</hi> and this Author's giving her <hi>two Handmaids,</hi> the one of which ought rather to be her <hi>Mother</hi> than her <hi>Maid,</hi> and the other can have nothing at all to do with her.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Two Handmaids wait the Throne, alike in Place,</l>
                  <l>But diff'ring far in Figure and in Face.</l>
                  <l>Here ſtood Ill-Nature, <hi>like an</hi> antient <hi>Maid</hi>—</l>
               </q>
               <p>Here the Author, with a great deal of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes a <hi>Univerſal</hi> ſubordinate to a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Ill-Nature</hi> may with ſome Colour be ſaid to be the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Spleen,</hi> but ſhe can never be call'd her <hi>Maid,</hi> without ſhocking common Senſe. The <hi>Nature</hi> of a Man muſt be <hi>coeval</hi> to the <hi>Man,</hi> and muſt far <hi>precede</hi> any Thing that the World calls <hi>Spleen</hi> in him. But let us take a View of her other Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, <hi>pag.</hi> 32.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>There <hi>Affectation</hi> with a ſickly Mien,</l>
                  <l>Shews in her Cheeks the Roſes of eighteen.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now <hi>Affectation</hi> can never have any Thing to do with <hi>Spleen. Spleen</hi> is the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which is <hi>Nature</hi>; <hi>Affectation</hi> is the <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> and for the moſt part is nothing but <hi>counterfeit Paſſion.</hi> Now he, who has violent Paſſions of his <hi>own,</hi> is hardly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0506900800:63"/>
at leiſure to counterfeit thoſe which are <hi>foreign</hi> to him; and therefore it has been often ſeen, that when too much <hi>Felicity</hi> has made a Fop <hi>affected, Spleen</hi> and <hi>Adverſity</hi> have brought him back to <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not take notice of the various Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Deſcription of what he calls the <hi>Palace of Spleen.</hi> I ſhall content myſelf with the Mention of one of them, which may not improperly be call'd the <hi>impoſſible Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Unnumber'd Throngs on ev'ry Side are ſeen</l>
                  <l>Of Bodies chang'd to various Forms by Spleen;</l>
                  <l>Here living Tea-pots ſtand, one Arm held out,</l>
                  <l>One bent; the Handle this, and that the Spout.</l>
                  <l>A Pipkin there, like <hi>Homer</hi>'s Tripod walks,</l>
                  <l>Here ſighs a Jar, and there a Gooſe-pie talks:</l>
                  <l>Men prove with Child, as pow'rful Fancy works,</l>
                  <l>And Maids, turn'd Bottles, call aloud for Corks.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now, Sir, I appeal to you and your Friends, if ever there was ſuch execrable Stuff, ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, ſuch deplorable Pleaſantry! What ſays <hi>Horace?</hi>

                  <hi>Good Senſe is the only Foundation both of Pleaſantry and Sublimity:</hi> But that which is out of <hi>Truth,</hi> is certainly out of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Good Senſe.</hi> Now was ever any Thing more out of <hi>Truth</hi> than the foregoing Deſcription? Inſtead of giving <hi>Spleen</hi> a Power to bring <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Deluſions</hi> upon Mortals, and to cheat them with <hi>falſe Appearances,</hi> this Author gives her the Power really to <hi>transform Bodies,</hi> and makes <hi>Umbriel</hi> the <hi>Gnome,</hi> who, as a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is ſuppos'd to ſee Things as they are, <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>really</hi> to behold that <hi>extravagant Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> But ſo much for the Sentiments of the fourth <hi>Canto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the fifth is very ſhort, and very inſipid, and as your humble Servant is very much tir'd, I ſhall make but two Obſervations upon it.</p>
               <p>In the Beginning of it there is a <hi>rampant Scuffle,</hi> which I ſuppoſe our Author took from the <hi>Rankneſs</hi> of a <hi>Buttock-Ball,</hi> ſo little is it becoming of Perſons of Condition.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>All ſide in Parties, and begin th' Attack,</l>
                  <l>Fans clap, Silks ruſtle, and tough Whale-bones crack,</l>
                  <l>Heroes and Heroines Shouts confus'dly riſe,</l>
                  <l>And baſs and treble Voices ſtrike the Skies:</l>
                  <l>No common Weapons in their Hands are found,</l>
                  <l>Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal Wound.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0506900800:65"/>
The latter Part is ſomething odd in the Mouth of the Tranſlator of <hi>Homer,</hi> who ought to know, that both <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> had been wounded by <hi>Diomedes.</hi> But if no <hi>common Weapons</hi> are found in the Hands of theſe Combatants, pray what Weapons are they which make the <hi>Silks to ruſtle,</hi> and the <hi>Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones to crack?</hi> But let us conſider what follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>So when bold <hi>Homer</hi> makes the Gods engage,</l>
                  <l>And heavenly Breaſts with human Paſſions rage,</l>
                  <l>'<hi>Gainſt</hi> Pallas, Mars, Latona, Hermes <hi>arms,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And all <hi>Olympus</hi> rings with loud Alarms:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Jove</hi>'s Thunder roars, Heav'n trembles all around,</l>
                  <l>Blue <hi>Neptune</hi> ſtorms, the bellowing Deeps reſound,</l>
                  <l>Earth ſhakes her nodding Tow'rs, the Ground gives way,</l>
                  <l>And the pale Ghoſts ſtart at the Flaſh of Day.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now, Sir, who ſays that this Paſſage is not very juſtly applied to a <hi>Catterwauling?</hi> But the latter Part of it is not taken from <hi>Homer,</hi> but from his moſt impertinent Imitator Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>De la Motte,</hi> and neither the one nor the other Trifler ſeem to have known any thing in this Paſſage, of the Solemnity, and the dreadful Majeſty of <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Beginning of the next Page the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines are full of miſerable Pleaſantry:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0506900800:66"/>
                  <l>While thro' the Preſs enrag'd <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> flies,</l>
                  <l>And ſcatters Death around from both her Eyes,</l>
                  <l>A Beau and Witling periſh'd in the Throng,</l>
                  <l>One died in Metaphor, and one in Song.</l>
                  <l>O cruel Nymph! a living Death I bear,</l>
                  <l>Cry'd <hi>Dapperwit,</hi> and ſunk beneath his Chair.</l>
                  <l>A mournful Glance, Sir <hi>Fopling</hi> upwards caſt,</l>
                  <l>Thoſe Eyes are made ſo killing!—was his laſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So that here we have a <hi>real Combat</hi> and a <hi>metaphorical dying.</hi> Now is not that, Sir, very ludicrous? What, did he fight, or make Love, as Profeſſors read, or as Popes fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>ex Cathedrâ?</hi> I cannot imagine how he could do that, unleſs he had got <hi>Belinda</hi> or <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> upon his Lap.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, have I gone thro' ſeveral of the <hi>Sentiments</hi> upon the <hi>Rape,</hi> which are either <hi>trifling,</hi> or <hi>falſe.</hi> But there are a great many Lines, which have <hi>no Sentiment</hi> at all in them, that is, no <hi>reaſonable Meaning.</hi> Such are the <hi>Puns</hi> which are every where ſpread throughout it. <hi>Puns</hi> bear the ſame Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Thought,</hi> that <hi>Bubbles</hi> hold to <hi>Bodies,</hi> and may juſtly be compared to thoſe gaudy Bladders which Children make with Soap; which, tho' they pleaſe their weak Capacities with a momentary Glittering, yet are but juſt beheld, and vaniſh into Air. Of this Nature is that Pun in the 5<hi>th Canto, p.</hi> 44.</p>
               <q>

                  <l>See fierce <hi>Belinda</hi> on the Baron flies,</l>
                  <l>With more than uſual Lightning in her Eyes,</l>
                  <l>Nor fears the Chief th' unequal Fight to try,</l>
                  <l>Who ſought no more than <hi>on</hi> his Foe to die.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is to ſay, <hi>He wiſh'd for nothing more than to fight with her, becauſe he deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to lie with her.</hi> Now what ſenſible Meaning can this have, unleſs he takes her for a <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> who is to grow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately fond of him by the extraordinary Gallantry of a luſty Baſtinado? Such like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is that <hi>Quibble</hi> in the following Page:</p>

All that we heard is, that by a dextrous Toſs of this <hi>modeſt Virgin,</hi> his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils were fill'd with Snuff. So that he ſeems here to ſay the ſame thing to her, that <hi>Nykin</hi> ſays to <hi>Cocky</hi> in the <hi>Old Batchelor</hi>; <hi>I have it in my Head, but you will have it in another Place.</hi> What follows ſeems to be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary:</p>

                  <l>Nor think to die dejects my lofty Mind,</l>

Now, Sir, who ever heard of a dead Man that burnt in <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Flames?</p>
               <p>Of the ſame Nature are thoſe numerous Banters in Rhyme, which are to be found throughout this Poem, which are ſo uniform, and ſo much of a piece, that one would ſwear the Author were giving a Receipt for dry Joking: For by placing ſomething important in the Beginning of a Period, and making ſomething very trifling follow it, he ſeems to take pains to bring <hi>ſomething</hi> into a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Copulative with <hi>nothing,</hi> in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>nothing.</hi> Of this there are divers Inſtances in <hi>Ariel</hi>'s Speech in the 2<hi>d Canto</hi>;</p>

                  <l>Some dire Diſaſter, or by Force or Sleight,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Which, by the way, I ſuppoſe is deſign'd as a bitter Bob for the <hi>Predeſtinarians.</hi> Raillery apart, we pretend not to deny, that the very minuteſt Events are foredoom'd by eternal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but that Heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Why then even <hi>Robin Goodfellow</hi> himſelf is not a more ſenſeleſs inſignificant Hobgoblin. Is he in Jeſt? Why then all this is a very grand Impertinence, ſince it does not ſo much as aim at any thing: For how can the Spirits be any ways influenced by theſe dry Jokes of their Leader?</p>
               <p>Of the ſame Stamp and the ſame Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance are theſe Lines in the Beginning of the 3<hi>d Canto</hi>:</p>

               <p>But ſo much for the <hi>Sentiments</hi> in this <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi>; I ſhould now come to the <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> But I have already tranſgreſs'd the Bounds I preſcribed to myſelf, and 'tis Time to take Pity of myſelf and you. I am, Sir,</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THO' I am heartily tired with what I have already ſent you, and am really aſhamed of having paſs'd a Week in thinking on ſuch an empty jingling Trifle as the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> a wretched Rhapſody, writ for the Amuſement of Boys, and Men like Boys; and tho' I am both very much indiſpoſed at preſent, and very buſy, yet ſince I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your Commands to ſend you ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> in that Bawble, in order to compleat the Converſion of Mrs. <hi>S<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>; I will, in Obedience to thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, do myſelf a little more Violence, and will do it in as ſhort a Time, and as ſmall a Compaſs as I can; for I will confine myſelf to the firſt twelve Lines, that by the numerous Faults which will be ſeen in them, any one to whom you may happen to ſhew this Letter, may be able to judge of the reſt.</p>
               <p>This Rhapſody begins with Abſurdity;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>What dire Offence from amorous Cauſes ſprings,</l>
                  <l>What mighty Conteſts riſe from trivial things,</l>
                  <l>I ſing—This Verſe to <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>_…</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> Muſe is due,</l>
                  <l>This ev'n <hi>Belinda</hi> may vouchſafe to view:</l>
                  <l>Slight is the Subject, but not ſo the Praiſe,</l>
                  <l>If ſhe inſpire, and he approve my Lays.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0506900800:71"/>
The two firſt of theſe Lines, and the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third, are out of all Grammatical Conſtruction: For here the Verb Active <hi>ſing</hi> has no Accuſative Caſe depending on it; as the Nominative Caſe is without a Verb in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Prologue to <hi>Cato,</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue was writ by the ſame little whimſical Gentleman.</p>
               <p>The Word <hi>Muſe</hi> is a mere Expletive, and can have nothing to do here, ſince 'tis <hi>Belinda</hi> only that is to inſpire him.</p>
               <p>There are no leſs than ſix Faults in the ſix Lines which he calls his Invocation:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Say, what ſtrange Motive, Goddeſs, cou'd compel</l>
                  <l>A well-bred Lord t' aſſault a gentle Belle?</l>
                  <l>O ſay, what ſtranger Cauſe, yet unexplor'd,</l>
                  <l>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord.</l>
                  <l>And dwells ſuch Rage in ſofteſt Boſoms then?</l>
                  <l>And dwells ſuch daring Souls in little Men?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now all this, if it were not for the Rhyme, would appear, even to Fools as well as to Men of Senſe, the pooreſt and moſt contemptible Stuff that ever laid the gentle Reader aſleep. I would fain know what the Word <hi>Goddeſs</hi> in the firſt Line <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Muſe, or <hi>Belinda. Goddeſs,</hi> by the uſual Signification of the Word, relates to <hi>Muſe,</hi> but according to Grammar and Conſtruction, it relates to <hi>Belinda,</hi> becauſe ſhe was mention'd laſt, and ſhe is the inſpiring Perſon. The Word <hi>compel</hi> in the firſt Line likewiſe is a Botch for the ſake of the Rhyme, the Word that ſhould naturally have been uſed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0506900800:72"/>
was either <hi>induce</hi> or <hi>provoke.</hi> The Word <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> ſuppoſes the Baron to be a Beaſt, and not a free Agent. Now, Sir, what a pretty Senſe theſe two firſt Lines make:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Say, what ſtrange Motive, Goddeſs, cou'd compel</l>
                  <l>A well-bred Lord t' aſſault a gentle Belle?</l>
               </q>
               <p>That is, what could <hi>force</hi> a <hi>well-bred</hi> Man to be damnably rude, and to ſhew himſelf an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Clown and a Brute? As for the Terms <hi>gentle Belle,</hi> they are too affected, too weak, and too low, and by no means come up to what is ſaid to <hi>Belinda</hi> in the very next Page by <hi>Ariel</hi> the Sylph:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Faireſt of Mortals, thou diſtinguiſh'd Care</l>
                  <l>Of thouſand bright Inhabitants of Air.</l>
               </q>
               <p>For <hi>Belle</hi> and <hi>Beau,</hi> as we have made them, as it were, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subſtantives, do not ſignify ſo much as Beautiful, tho' as they are <hi>French</hi> Adjectives they have that Signification. No Man when he calls another <hi>Beau,</hi> means, that that other is handſome, but only that he takes a great deal of Poppiſh Care about his Dreſs, and gives himſelf a great many fantaſtick Airs, in order to pleaſe ſuperficial People, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf ridiculous to Men of Senſe. <hi>Belle</hi> has much the ſame Signification, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent Uſe and Acceptation of the Word, no more ſignifies a beautiful Woman than <hi>Coquette</hi> does, but only one that takes a great deal of fruitleſs Pains to make herſelf
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0506900800:73"/>
more agreeable than God and Nature have made her. But let us go on to the next Couplet:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Oh ſay, what ſtranger Cauſe, yet unexplor'd,</l>
                  <l>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?</l>
               </q>
               <p>The Cauſe was, becauſe ſhe did not like him; a ſtrange Cauſe indeed, and which required a great deal of Sagacity to find it out. But to what Purpoſe is the Word <hi>reject? Belinda</hi> granted him every thing that he ask'd of her. He deſired to wait upon her to <hi>Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Court,</hi> and ſhe granted it. He deſired her to make one at <hi>Ombre,</hi> and ſhe complied with that Requeſt likewiſe. If ſhe granted no more, it was becauſe he ask'd no more: For, if we may believe herſelf, by what ſhe ſays at the Beginning of the <hi>fourth Canto,</hi> ſhe would have refuſed him nothing unleſs it was her <hi>favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Lock:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Oh hadſt thou, cruel, been content to ſeize</l>
                  <l>Hairs leſs in Sight, or any Hairs but theſe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>For ſhe, who ſeems inclin'd to ſacrifice her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to her Vanity, would, in all likelihood, have ſacrificed it to her Pleaſure. In ſhort, the Baron is ſo far from making Love in this Rhapſody, that he plainly ſhews, by the rude Affront which he puts upon <hi>Belinda,</hi> that he expected no particular Favour from her. And indeed this Party of Pleaſure at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> ſeems to me to look more like Catterwauling, than the Behaviour of Perſons who went thither
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0506900800:74"/>
with any amorous Deſign. But let us proceed to the next Couplet:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>And dwells ſuch Rage in ſofteſt Boſoms then?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Yes, moſt certainly does it; and if this little Gentleman had not had a Head more ſoft than <hi>Belinda</hi>'s Boſom, he could never have been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of asking ſo ſimple a Queſtion. The ſofter Sex are much more ſubject to violent Paſſions than Men. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhewed a Softneſs in <hi>Dido,</hi> which this little Gentleman is utterly incapable of comprehending; a Softneſs which obliged a Sovereign Queen, whoſe Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was equal to her Supreme Power, or to her Greatneſs of Mind, to grant the laſt Favour to the <hi>Trojan</hi> Hero, and yet that Softneſs was immediately ſucceeded by a Rage, to whoſe Force, and whoſe noble Enthuſiaſm, this little Creature, who is as diminutive an Author as he is an Animal, is as utterly incapable of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, as an earthly Vapour is of aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven. But tho' nothing is more plain than that <hi>Rage</hi> may dwell in <hi>ſofteſt Boſoms,</hi> yet had it no more to do here than <hi>reject,</hi> and indeed had the leſs to do here becauſe of <hi>reject:</hi> For cannot a Lady deny a Gentleman who makes a civil Requeſt to her, but ſhe muſt ſall immediately into as raving a Fit, as ſhe could have done, if he had extorted the Favour from her. <hi>Reject</hi> ſhews <hi>Contempt</hi> rather than <hi>Rage:</hi> It ſhews that ſhe did not eſteem the Baron enough to be at all angry with him. But let us come to the ſecond Line of the Couplet:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0506900800:75"/>
                  <l>And dwells ſuch daring Souls in little Men?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Yes certainly, <hi>daring Souls</hi> dwell often in <hi>little Men,</hi> and for that very Reaſon, becauſe they are <hi>little Men.</hi> Did he never hear of what <hi>Statius</hi> ſays of little <hi>Tydeus:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>—totoſque infuſa per artus</l>
                  <l>Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I myſelf know a little Monſter, who, I dare venture to propheſy, will one Day ſhew as <hi>daring</hi> a Soul as a mad <hi>Indian</hi> who runs a muck. But what Occaſion is there for <hi>daring Souls</hi> here? The Baron ſhews a good deal of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> and a good deal of <hi>Perfidy,</hi> but no <hi>Daring.</hi> He ſhew'd a great deal of <hi>Courage</hi> indeed, in coming treacherouſly behind a Lady and cutting off her favourite Lock!</p>
               <p>But all this Piece, is, like <hi>Windſor Foreſt,</hi> or the <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> below Criticiſm; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take my Leave of you. It would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to expect that you ſhould read Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks with Pleaſure which I write with Pain; Remarks which may be made by the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reader, without any Penetration or any Sagacity. Beſides, I have given a ſufficient Sample to enable Mrs. <hi>S<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
