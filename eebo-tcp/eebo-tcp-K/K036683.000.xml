            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOSE who devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to POETRY, have but one Way of paying the higheſt Favours; their Returns are only the Fruits of that Art which they cultivate; and they might well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail this as a Partiality in Nature, were not the Gifts of Genius ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beyond thoſe of Fortune. Men who, like your Self, can give Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Names they honour, have no Reaſon to complain of the Muſes: But ſuch as we, who have it in our
<pb facs="tcp:0072803100:4"/>
Wills to be grateful, and are ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd in the only Powers we have to ſhew it, feel greater Uneaſineſs from Obligations, than is eaſy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. In ſuch a Situation, we have nothing left, but our Attempts to pleaſe; and theſe your ſuperior Geniuses muſt look upon rather as a Homage, than a Return; the Effects of our good Wiſhes, rather than the Accompliſhment of our Deſires.</p>
            <p>NEXT to being eminent in one's own Character, to be diſtinguiſh'd by Men of Excellence, is the happieſt Praiſe; and as one of theſe is very often introductory to the other, ſo has it happen'd to you; the <hi>Greateſt Men</hi> among us firſt obſerv'd and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd your Merit, and you ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the Acknowledgment, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Merit uſeful and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to your Country. What a noble Teſtimony do your living Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues give to the Diſcernment of the late Lord <hi>HALIFAX!</hi> that Great Man had the peculiar Happineſs of
<pb facs="tcp:0072803100:5"/>
making Wit and Learning not only a Qualification for his Friendſhip, but of Service to the Buſineſs and Management of publick Affairs. The Familiarity you have always enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with the firſt Men of Letters, and the Applauſe with which you have acted, and ſtill continue to act, in the Sphere of Buſineſs, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your Honour, and have ſet your Character as much above Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as Detraction.</p>
            <p>FOR my Part, it has always been my Ambition to deſire the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Men of your Turn; and I never have, or ſhall be aſham'd of publiſhing the Virtues of thoſe who have been eminent in their Services for our KING, Country, and Legal Conſtitution; and in this View (if any Thing of mine can reach ſo far) would I be look'd upon by Poſterity.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time, I cannot but congratulate my Country for breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch gallant free Spirits, who,
<pb facs="tcp:0072803100:6"/>
like your Self, have roſe up in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the two moſt implacable Powers that can be let looſe upon Mankind, <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> It is your Praiſe, Sir, to have acted a moſt noble Part on this Account, in the <hi>Iriſh Senate;</hi> a Country more than once the Scene of the moſt dreadful Maſſacres, but now, by the Actions of YOU and your fellow PATRIOTS, happily recover'd from the ſame threat'ning (and oh! too near) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Perſecution.</p>
            <p>SUCH publick Services as theſe, tho' they give Joy and Bleſſings to a whole Nation, yet they more nearly affect thoſe who have a Share in your Eſteem. Among the great Number that your Merit have made your Friends, I am proud to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one, and to have it known to the World, I had your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to prefix your Name to this TRAGEDY. I ſhall be very neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent with the Criticks, and ſet my Heart at Reſt on Account of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
<pb facs="tcp:0072803100:7"/>
if it has the good Fortune in the leaſt to pleaſe, and divert one Hour of your Retirement. It comes to you with ſincere Wiſhes for a happy <hi>New-Year,</hi> for a long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Health; and that you may remain, what now you are, an Ornament to the Poſt you fill, and Bleſſing to the Nation you are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily planted in, are the hearty Wiſhes and Prayers of,</p>
