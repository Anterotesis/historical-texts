            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ADDRESSES of this Nature, which are too often fulſom Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Vanity, or ſervile Applications to Power, when made to Perſons of real Worth and Honour, are at the ſame Time Compliments artfully paid by Authors to themſelves..... While the Writer is deſcanting upon the high Birth, inflexible Probity, patriot Spirit, humane Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the polite and literary Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of his Patron, he inſinuates himſelf into the good Opinion of his Reader, as one favoured with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and honoured by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Regard of a Perſon thus
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0093400102:3"/>
amiable and illuſtrious..... I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, my Lord, wholly to diſclaim all Views of this Kind in the preſent Addreſs I have the Honour to make to you; and accordingly ſhould take a particular Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in enlarging upon the above, and other ſhining Qualities in your Lordſhip's Character, did I not recollect that I have no Right to gratify the Public, or myſelf, at the Expence of your Lordſhip's private and perſonal Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is my preſent Intereſt rather to engage your Lordſhip's favourable Opinion of the following Performances; and I know nothing more likly to do this than an Aſſurance that I have aim'd by a ſuitable Variety to adapt myſelf to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Sorts of Readers but immoral ones; that in ſome Pieces I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to render the Graces of Numbers and the Embelliſhments of Poetry ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0093400102:4"/>
to the Intereſts of Virtue, and Religion; that in others I have offered ſuch critical Diſquiſitions as I hope will afford at leaſt a rational Entertainment to Men of Taſte in polite Literature; and that in them all I have endeavoured occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally to expreſs myſelf with Dignity, Elegance, and Eaſe, which, by the way, are not more the Characteriſtics of good Writing, than of the Air, Manner, and Converſation of a certain Nobleman I have the Honour to be known to..... I look upon myſelf as apologizing to the Public when I am ſpeaking to your Lordſhip, and therefore have ſaid thus much from a perfect Senſe of the Conſequence it muſt be to me as an Author to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your Lordſhip's Approbation of my Writings.</p>
            <p>The Dedication of theſe to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will after all, I fear, be thought a
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0093400102:5"/>
trifling Proof of my Reſpect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire it may however be conſider'd as a ſincere Teſtimony of my Gratitude for the many Favours you have been pleaſed to confer on me; the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of which have been attended with this Circumſtance of Credit and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that they are to be attributed to your Lordſhip's free and unſolicited Kindneſs, and Condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>The Obligations I am under to your Lordſhip are not of a Nature to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here; but this Opportunity of expreſſing a due Acknowledgment of them in the moſt ample and public Manner, is with the greateſt Pleaſure taken by</p>

                  <p>AS the Subject of the following Poem naturally led me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it to one of your Sex, I could not but hope, that the Juſtneſs of the preſent Addreſs, from one who has not the Happineſs to be perſonally known to you, would be a ſufficient Apology for the Preſumption of it. But tho' I may have the Misfortune to incur your Diſpleaſure, by offending your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, I ſhall, even under the Senſe of your Diſapprobation, have the Satisfaction to reflect, that I have been guilty of a very artful Piece of Impertinence; ſince, by placing your Name before my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, I have taken the moſt effectual Method to recommend it to the Public.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0093400102:8"/>
Your Example, Madam, is a Reproach to the preſent indolent Generation; your Glory is not eſtabliſhed upon the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Advantages you poſſeſs in ſo eminent a Manner; which, great as they are, your good Senſe aſſures you, are, at the beſt, but the Subjects of preſent Admiration, and can never be the Baſis of a laſting Fame.</p>
                  <p>Your Handy-work, Madam, which has very juſtly a Place among the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities of that famous Univerſity, of which I have the Honour and Happineſs to be an inconſiderable Member, has rendered your Name immortal; and your nice Management of the Needle, that little, but important Implement of Oeconomy, has entitled you to the Reputation of the compleateſt Houſewife in <hi>Europe;</hi> a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to which all Virgins and Wives ſhould aſpire.</p>
                  <p>You have taught us to acknowlege, that the moſt minute Utenſil of Art may,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0093400102:9"/>
by an ingenious Application of it, be made ſubſervient, in the higheſt Degree, to the Honour of the Artiſt: A Pin, or a Needle, in your Hands, are Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as effectual for that Purpoſe, as the Poet's Pen, or the Hero's Sword.</p>
                  <p>I am at preſent, Madam, in a very perplexed Situation of Mind; I have the Pleaſure to conſider, that I am now upon a Subject that muſt be agreeable to all my Readers, and at the ſame time have the Mortification to recollect, that 'tis diſtaſteful to yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>Though therefore all I could ſay in Commendation of your Merit, the World would think too little, yet, as what I have ſaid you will think too much, I find myſelf under a Neceſſity of deſiring your Pardon for this Liberty I have taken, and for another in the fourth Canto of this Poem, wherein I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to put a ſhort Prediction, relating
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0093400102:10"/>
to your amiable Character, into the Mouth of the Queen of Love. This I need not otherwiſe have intimated, ſince every one muſt at firſt Sight perceive, that this Prediction is properly applicable to none but yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>After what I have ſaid, Madam, may I venture to hope you have ſome Patience in Reſerve for the Poem? 'Twas deſign'd for your Amuſement, and, if that Deſign be anſwered, my Ambition is ſatisfied: And indeed, to ſay Truth, I have ſo thorough a Confidence in your good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that I am perſuaded you will look with a favourable Eye upon the following Performance, though not in Juſtice, yet in Pity to,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I Have always conſidered a Preface as an Author's Apology for his Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; in which he has an undoubted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſaying as much as he pleaſes in Favour of himſelf: As I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but be apprehenſive of the Succeſs of the following Piece, I muſt beg Leave to take this comfortable Privilege, as well as my Poetical Brethren. The principal Circumſtances I have to urge in my own Behalf, are, that this Poem is the firſt Production of a young and unexperienced Author (excepting a few trifling Pieces in the <hi>Magazines);</hi> and that I am ſo far from bidding Defiance to the Critics, that I addreſs myſelf to them in the modeſt and

                  <p>As to the Poem itſelf, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, in ſome particular Paſſages, to imitate the Manner of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> upon a Preſumption, that ſuch Imitation would be deemed meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſo young a Writer as myſelf. I ought likewiſe to acknowlege, that I had in View the Epiſode of the <hi>Patten</hi> in Mr. <hi>Gay</hi>'s <hi>Trivia.</hi> How far I have reached the Spirit required in this Kind of Poetry, muſt be left to the Reader, to whoſe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Judgment I ſubmit the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poem.</p>

                  <head>THE THIMBLE. <note n="*" place="bottom">THE THIMBLE, &amp;c.] The Author, by this ſimple Title of his Poem, has very judiciouſly eſcaped the Cenſure, which moſt modern Poets have incured, by their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Antiquity in their Title-Pages. This excellent Poem might, with as much Propriety, have been called <hi>The Thimblead,</hi> or <hi>The Thimbleiad,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s was intituled <hi>The Dunciad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> But ſuch Imitation appeared trifling and obvious to our Author, and, at beſt, had been <hi>mal-apropos,</hi> and nothing to the <hi>Point</hi>—of a <hi>Needle.</hi>—I wiſh, however, I could as well account for his calling it an <hi>Heroi-comical</hi> Poem, rather than an <hi>Heroic</hi> one; which I take it indiſputably to be. It has its Action, its Fable, its Manners, its Sentiment, and its Diction, which are the conſtituent Parts of the <hi>Epic</hi> Poem. And though, in reſpect of all theſe, it may, in ſome Inſtances, differ from the Plan of the Antients, and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> I cannot think it thereby degraded into a different and lower Species of Poetry. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> himſelf allows, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Rules for <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry (which he has drawn from his Reflections upon <hi>Homer)</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to quadrate exactly with the <hi>Heroic</hi> Poems, which have been, or may be, made ſince his Time. <hi>(See</hi> Spec. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 273.) For this Reaſon, it would be ridiculous to object to the Action of this Poem, its Deficiency in Point of Greatneſs or Importance—a ſuppoſed neceſſary Qualification in the Action of the <hi>Epopee;</hi> and indeed, admitting it ſo to be, the Objection is founded in falſe and improper Ideas of <hi>Greatneſs and Importance;</hi> and in the wrong Impreſſions made upon Minds of a romantic Turn by the Exploits of antient Heroes, and the Manners and Cuſtoms of barbarous and uncivilized Nations. Becauſe what was a proper Subject for <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry, in the Days of <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> would be ſhocking and abſurd in ſo <hi>refined and delicate an Age as this.</hi> The Action of this Poem is abundantly important for theſe Times of <hi>genteel Indolence, and ſuperb Tranquility;</hi> and the Author, all the while, inſtead of dropping his Acquaintance with the Antients, art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully makes uſe of it upon many Occaſions, without a Poſſibility of giving Offence to any <hi>fine Lady or Gentleman,</hi> by ſuch <hi>robuſt and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate</hi> Imagery, as that with which the old <hi>Epic</hi> abounds.—We ſhall occaſionally ſhew, in the Courſe of our Criticiſms, that he rarely in any reſpect deviates from the antient Plan without improving it.—What has been already advanced will juſtify likewiſe his making a Lady the principal perſonage in the Poem.—If female Characters are reſpectable, even in the Writings of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> Decency, ſure, Propriety, and Complaiſance, required they ſhould have the firſt Place in the Poem before us.—Thus much we thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to premiſe in general; we ſhall proceed to farther Remarks, as they are ſuggeſted by the Poem itſelf.</note>

                  <p>THOUGH I am happy in your Permiſſion to ſhelter under your Name a Performance which ſtands in much Need of your Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, eſpecially as it comes into the World with ſome Diſadvantage; yet I hope you will do me the Juſtice to believe me actuated by a nobler Principle than that of a Selfiſhneſs common to all Authors, in my Choice of a Patron upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>For, Sir, the following Sheets are with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Propriety yours, whether you are conſidered as a Perſon ſincerely attached to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> or affectionately intereſting yourſelf in the Welfare of <hi>Pembroke-College;</hi> to the Regard and beſt Wiſhes of which Society you have a double Claim, both as an Ornament, and a Benefactor.</p>
                  <p>The common Topics of Panegyric are obvious; and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of thoſe many amiable Qualities, which adorn you in public and private Life, and for which you are ſo juſtly beloved and eſteemed: But my Inclination is corrected by a ſeaſonable Thought, that moſt Writers of the preſent Age
<pb facs="tcp:0093400102:64"/>
have, in this Reſpect, a conſiderable Advantage over me, as it is much more eaſy to make a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, than to deſcribe one.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it would be needleſs to enter into a Detail of thoſe Praiſes, which are already in the Mouth of every Well-wiſher to his Country: And therefore I will only indulge the Impulſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which points to that Part of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which more immediately affects me; your Good-nature and Condeſcenſion, to which I am indebted for the Honour of your Acquaintance and Friendſhip, and for your favourable Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the following Poem.</p>
                  <p>Give me Leave to aſſure you, Sir, that I am principally anxious for the Reputation of this Tragedy, from an earneſt Deſire of tranſmitting to Poſterity a Monument of the Regard and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration I have for the Perſon and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS.

                  <p>THE moſt <hi>material</hi> Objection to this Tragedy, made by Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> was, that it is rather a <hi>Poem,</hi> than a <hi>Play.</hi>—A <hi>conſolatory</hi> Octjection at leaſt! as it is founded only in the Author's acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged Tranſgreſſion of the <hi>mechanical</hi> Laws of the <hi>Drama.</hi> But however reaſonable the Objection might be to the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of this Tragedy upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> it was by no Means thought a ſufficient one to its <hi>original</hi> Publication; nor conſequently, 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, will be eſteemed ſuch againſt its having a Place in the <hi>preſent</hi> Collection.—Thoſe who are offended at the Liberties taken in it, may, if they pleaſe, call it an <hi>Hiſtorical Play,</hi> and then all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of this Nature vaniſh of Courſe.—After all, the Objection will perhaps have <hi>leſs</hi> Weight with the candid and judicious Reader, when he has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with his Peruſal the <hi>Eſſay</hi> on the <hi>Antient and Modern Drama;</hi> though he is not to look upon that <hi>Eſſay</hi> as written with a View to the Defence of <hi>this particular</hi> Play, or to conſider <hi>this Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as any Thing like a Declaration of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Right</hi> of Exemption from the <hi>common Rules of the Drama,</hi> by Virtue of any ſuperiour <hi>Qualifications</hi> in <hi>Himſelf.</hi>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Tragedy of <hi>Cymbeline</hi> is, in the whole oeconomy of it, one of the moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular productions of <hi>Shakeſpeare.</hi> Its defects however, or rather its ſuperfluities, are more than equalled by beauties, and excellencies of various kinds. There is at the ſame time ſomething ſo pleaſingly romantic, and likewiſe truly <hi>Britiſh</hi> in the ſubject of it, that, I flatter myſelf, an attempt to reduce it, as near as poſſible, to the regular ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the <hi>drama,</hi> will be favourably received by all, who are admirers of <hi>novelty,</hi> when <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> is its foundation. I have accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to new-conſtruct this Tragedy, almoſt upon the plan of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, in reſpect of the <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> with ſo thorough a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion however for the great <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtage, that, even while I have preſumed to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and modernize his deſign, I have thought it an honour to tread in his ſteps, and to imitate his Stile, with the humility and reverence of a <hi>Son.</hi> With this view, I have retained in <hi>many</hi> places the very language of the original author, and in
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0093400102:230"/>
                     <hi>all</hi> others endeavoured to ſupply it with a diction ſimilar thereunto; ſo that, as an unknown friend of mine has obſerved, the preſent attempt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>new,</hi> whether it be conſidered as an <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from,</hi> or an <hi>imitation of Shakeſpeare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>—The <hi>difficulty</hi> of ſuch an attempt, as <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> as it may be, has a kind of <hi>claim,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, to the <hi>indulgence</hi> of the public; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it has been attended likewiſe with <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages.</hi>—For I found myſelf neceſſitated by my plan to <hi>drop ſome</hi> characters, to <hi>contract others,</hi> and to omit <hi>ſome</hi> ſcenes and incidents of an intereſting nature;—or rather to bring the ſubſtance and purport of them within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a few ſhort narrations.—A loſs irrepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this, but that conveniencies are likewiſe to be thrown into the oppoſite ſcale; for as, I hope, I have not <hi>injured</hi> any characters by <hi>contracting</hi> them, but have left them to <hi>all intents,</hi> and in point of <hi>importance</hi> the <hi>ſame;</hi> ſo I have had an opportunity of <hi>enlarging</hi> and <hi>improving ſome</hi> of the original parts, (thoſe particularly of <hi>Palador,</hi> and <hi>Philario,</hi> the <hi>Piſanio of Shakeſpeare)</hi> and, by varying certain incidents and circumſtances, of giving a <hi>new caſt</hi> to the whole <hi>drama.</hi>—After all, I am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of <hi>Shakeſpeare;</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from inſinuating that the plays of ſo exalted a genius <hi>require</hi> ſuch
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0093400102:231"/>
new-modelling as the preſent, in order to the rendering them uſeful or entertaining.—I have ventured publicly to defend this great <hi>dramatic</hi> Poet in the liberties he has taken; but ſtill <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> himſelf needs not be <hi>aſhamed</hi> to <hi>wear</hi> a <hi>modern dreſs,</hi> provided it can be made tolerably to <hi>fit</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>The only queſtion then will be, whether the preſent <hi>alteration</hi> be a judicious one?—And this with all due deference is left to the candour and juſtice of the public.</p>
                  <p>It will be proper to acquaint the reader, that, this play, was recommended ſome time ſince by a perſon of the firſt diſtinction, to the manager of the other theatre; who declared, that he had the very ſame altered play in his poſſeſſion, and that it was deſigned for repreſentation on his ſtage. Our <hi>Cymbeline</hi> therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> where he has contended not only with the <hi>uſual</hi> difficulties, but alſo with <hi>others</hi> of an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> nature—Mrs. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s declining the part of <hi>Imogen</hi> has done the play incredible prejudice; and convinces me of the vanity of ſtriving againſt the ſtream of popularity in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or the weight of particular diſadvantages.—However, I am under obligations to <hi>many</hi>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0093400102:232"/>
of the performers, for their beſt endeavours to do juſtice to my piece, and for their zeal for its ſucceſs. To <hi>ſome</hi> I am indebted for real ſervice, whoſe names, as compariſons are invidious, I leave it to the judgment of the reader to ſupply.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I am at a loſs to ballance the account between myſelf and my fortune, in this whimſical ſituation. The kind aſſiſtance, and, I hope, not extremely partial approbation of <hi>ſome,</hi> adds as much to my <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as the <hi>delicacy,</hi> or <hi>ill-nature,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>others,</hi> has deducted from my <hi>advantages.</hi>—To my <hi>friends,</hi> I return my ſincere acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and beſt wiſhes; to my <hi>enemies,</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing, 'till they are <hi>candid,</hi> and <hi>ſagacious</hi> enough to ſpeak more <hi>plainly</hi> than they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done,—and more <hi>to the purpoſe.</hi>

                  <head>AN ESSAY ON THE ANTIENT and MODERN DRAMA.</head>
                  <p>I Have often read with much Pleaſure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s <hi>Dramatic Poem,</hi> entitled <hi>Elfrida,</hi> together with the preparatory <hi>Letters</hi> with which that Gentleman introduces it to the Public. This Piece is profeſſedly written on the Model of the antient <hi>Greek Tragedy;</hi> and though I flatter myſelf, the Objections I have to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples laid down in thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> are not removed by this much-labour'd Attempt, yet I will readily own the Deſign is executed with a ſkilful hand, and in ſome reſpects deſerves the Attention of the preſent Writers of the <hi>Engliſh Drama.</hi> I did not therefore undertake this Argument with any Inclination to differ from a Perſon of his known
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0093400102:365"/>
Taſte, and greatly admired Abilities, but purely in Vindication of the Theory I have had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to deliver in a Courſe of <hi>Lectures</hi> to the UNIVERSITY of OXFORD, in which, with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular View to the Juſtification of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> I have ventured to advance and defend a Syſtem in ſome material Points inconſiſtent with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſent Conſideration. Neither am I unaware of the great Diſadvantage I have to contend againſt, when I oppoſe a celebrated Writer, whoſe Sentiments are countenanc'd by the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the antient Poets, and whoſe Pen is drawn under the Banner of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf: A Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which the Uſage of later Writers, and the almoſt concurrent Voice of modern Criticiſm <note n="*" place="bottom">By modern Criticiſm I mean that Plan upon which the <hi>Engliſh Drama</hi> had been form'd for a Courſe of many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and which Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> and other Critics and Poets have in our Days attempted, both by Precept and Example, to ſuperſede and explode in favour of the Antient Syſtem.</note>perhaps will be thought little enough to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance. However, as in Matters of Taſte we ought only, I apprehend, to appeal to the genuine Dictates of Good-ſenſe, Reaſon and Nature (which an implicit Veneration for any Name Antient or Modern may poſſibly prevent our regarding) ſo, if Prejudices on both Sides were removed, it would probably appear that the Victory is rather to be divided, than determined, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depreciating the real Merit and Excellency
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0093400102:366"/>
of the antient Poets, we may yet ſafely defend the Principles on which the Moderns reject their Writings as the abſolute and everlaſting Standard of <hi>Dramatic</hi> Compoſition: I mean principally with regard to the three great Unities of Action, Time, and Place.—What I have to ſay therefore upon theſe Subjects I ſubmit without farther Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to the Judgment of the intelligent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, advertiſing him only in this Place, that he is not to expect a Methodical Treatiſe of elaborate Criticiſm, but only a Train of occaſional Thoughts and Reflections, as they occur'd to me upon the Peruſal of the Poem of <hi>Elfrida,</hi> and the <hi>Letters</hi> prefix'd to it.</p>
                  <q>Had I intended, ſays Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> in his firſt Letter, (for I chuſe to repeat his own Words to prevent Miſapprehenſion) to give an exact Copy of the antient <hi>Drama,</hi> your objections to the preſent Poem would be unanſwerable. But my deſign was much leſs confin'd. I meant only to purſue the antient Method ſo far as is probable a Greek Poet, were he alive, would now do, in order to adapt himſelf to the Genius of our Times, and the Character of our Tragedy. According to this Notion, every Thing was to be allow'd to the preſent Taſte, which Nature and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could poſſibly diſpenſe with; and nothing of Intrigue or refinement was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, at which antient Judgment could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0093400102:367"/>
take Offence. Good Senſe, as well as Antiquity, preſcribed an adherence to the three great Unities; theſe therefore were ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</q>
                  <p>'Tis evident from this Paſſage, the ingenious Author would have us conſider the Laws of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and the Practice of Antiquity relating to the great Unities, as manifeſtly founded in the firſt Principles of Nature and Good Senſe; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in order to adapt himſelf to the preſent Taſte no farther than might be juſtly allowable, we find him deviating from the Rules and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Antiquity but in two Inſtances; Firſt in the Choice of a Story, in which Love is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Paſſion, and Secondly, in which Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are repreſented as nearly approaching to private ones as <hi>Tragic</hi> Dignity would permit. Upon our Author's <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> indeed theſe are perhaps almoſt the only Deviations that could be allow'd him; and the Point muſt at once be given up, if the Theory be true which is here in ſo poſitive a manner advanc'd. For Satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Matter it may be uſeful in the firſt Place to obſerve, that the Action of the antient <hi>Drama,</hi> when brought to the Perfection in which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> found it, was ſo ſtrictly One, and the Fable ſo abſolutely Simple, and almoſt totally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent from Incident, at leaſt from what Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> calls Contrivance, Refinement and Intrigue,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0093400102:368"/>
that the Conſtitution of the <hi>Drama</hi> did not ſo properly require, as ſuppoſe and imply a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent Unity of Time and Place. Nay, uſually we find among the antient <hi>Greek</hi> Poets the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Action of the <hi>Drama</hi> was brought within the Compaſs of the Repreſentation itſelf. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if <hi>exact</hi> Nature and <hi>ſtrict</hi> Propriety are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably to be the Objects of the <hi>Dramatic</hi> Poet's Attention upon all Occaſions, this muſt be allow'd to be the moſt perfect Model of <hi>Tragedy;</hi> and conſequently <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf ſeems to have indulg'd the <hi>Tragic</hi> Muſe too far, when in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the ſometime Practice of the <hi>Greek Poets,</hi> He has preſcrib'd a Day as the due and regular Boundary of all <hi>Dramatic</hi> Action. For certainly a Day cannot really be compriz'd within the Space of five Hours any more than a Year, or any preciſe Duration whatſoever. The Truth is, Poetry was the Mother of Criticiſm, not Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of Poetry, and accordingly this great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher form'd his ſimple Notions and Rules upon the beſt Plan of the <hi>Drama</hi> then extant; but I cannot think it will by any Means follow that thoſe Rules are in all Points of perpetual and neceſſary Obligation: For why was it not in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as agreeable to Nature and Reaſon for the Poets to admit Contrivance and Policy, Deſign and Intrigue into the Conſtitution of the Fable, as it could poſſibly be to confine themſelves to the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0093400102:369"/>
Repreſentation of the moſt ſimple and uniform Action; eſpecially as they hereby improv'd, and heighten'd that Perplexity, and Diſtreſs, which are the great Sources of Delight in Dramatic En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment? I ſay this Latitude of Deſign is not in itſelf unreaſonable or unnatural, becauſe 'tis not to be diſſembled that the Liberty contended for would indeed be, as it has been, in the Hands of the unſkilful and injudicious, an Inlet to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Abſurdity. However it will not ſurely be denied that there is in Fact a very material Difference between Incidents, and the Variety of Deſigns and Contrivances that occaſion them, and mere Buſtle and <hi>Buſineſs;</hi> in his contempt of which Word Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> ſeems willing to involve the whole Syſtem of <hi>Dramatic</hi> Intrigue. The general Theory I would therefore advance is this, (for I would not be underſtood to aſſert it admits of no Exception) that it is not barely the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, but often even the Duty of the <hi>Dramatic</hi> Poet to adapt himſelf to the Viciſſitudes of Public Taſte, and to repreſent human Life, and human Actions as he finds them; and if in Purſuance of this Deſign, he may think it expedient to make Choice of a Subject of ſuch a complicated Nature as cannot with Eaſe and Conſiſtency be diſpatch'd within the <hi>ſtatutable</hi> Limits of Time, and Place, I cannot ſee why we may not indulge him with a proportionable Allowance of each, in order to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0093400102:370"/>
prevent infinitely greater Abſurdities and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies than that Allowance can poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, that is, thoſe confus'd and precipitate Action. And all this while the Extenſiveneſs of the Deſign, provided it be executed with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in other Reſpects, deſerves rather to be look'd upon as an Excellence and an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the old Model, than to be placed to the Account either of the Ignorance or the Inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Writer; of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <q>There is that Sovereign Quality in Poetry (to uſe the Words of the ingenious Author of the <hi>Notes on the Epiſtle to Auguſtus)</hi> which the Poet <hi>(Horace)</hi> in the following paſſage,
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Ille per extenſum funem mihi poſſe videtur</l>
                           <l>Ire Poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,</l>
                           <l>Irritat, mulcet, falſis terroribus implet,</l>
                           <l>Ut Magnus; et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis:</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
conſiders as a kind of <hi>magic virtue,</hi> which tranſports the Spectator into all Places, and makes him, occaſionally, aſſume all Perſons. The Reſemblance holds alſo in this, that it's effects are inſtantaneous and irreſiſtible. <hi>Rules, Art, Decorum,</hi> all fall before it. It goes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Heart, and gains all purpoſes at once. Hence it is, that ſpeaking of a real Genius, poſſeſſed of this commanding Power, <hi>Horace</hi> in the Lines above quoted, <hi>Ille per extenſum,</hi> &amp;c. pronounces him emphatically
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0093400102:371"/>
                     <hi>The Poet;</hi> it being more eſpecially this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which, of itſelf, diſcovers the <hi>true Dramatiſt,</hi> and ſecures the ſucceſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, not only without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Art,</hi> but in direct Oppoſition to it's cleareſt Dictates.</q>
                  <p>This Paſſage which I have quoted <hi>verbatim</hi> (abating a few Expreſſions in it) exactly coincides with my ſentiment upon this Head; and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication which the Author makes of it in Favour of <hi>Corneille,</hi> may, I preſume, be made with equal Propriety at leaſt in Behalf of our <hi>Shakeſpeare.</hi>—I am ſenſible all this while that this great Prince and Father of the Engliſh <hi>Stage</hi> is ſuppoſed by Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> to have ſhewn a total Diſregard of all the Rules of the <hi>Drama,</hi> in Compliance merely with the Taſte of the Times. I muſt own, I could have been glad to have ſeen fewer Things <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> upon this Subject. I will take the Liberty like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that this great Poet ſaw no legal or neceſſary Reſtraint upon the Force and Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Genius with Regard to the Unities of Action, Time and Place; that he conſidered the Laws relating to them as merely local and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, well adapted indeed to the ſimple Genius of antient <hi>Tragedy,</hi> but in themſelves and the Reaſon of Things diſpenſable upon the Suppoſition of a <hi>Dramatic</hi> Plan of a more extenſive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Nature. His Opinion might be (like the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0093400102:372"/>
current one mentioned in Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s ſecond <hi>Letter)</hi> that <q>the ſtrict Adherence to the Unities reſtrains the Genius of the Poet; by the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of it's Conduct diminiſhes the Pathos of the Fable; and by the Admiſſion of a continued Chorus prevents that agreeable Embarraſs, which awakens our Attention, and intereſts our Paſſions.</q>—However, that the Nature of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic</hi> Poetry will not only admit of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Model than the <hi>Tragedies</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets furniſh us with, but is alſo improveable by the ſame, if it cannot be proved, may at leaſt I think be inferr'd even from the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf. This great Critic, it is very well known, calls the <hi>Fable</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Tragedy;</hi> with a manifeſt Eye to which Expreſſion, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> obſerves that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> places the <hi>Fable</hi> firſt, <q>non quoad <hi>Dignitatem,</hi> ſed quoad <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi>
                     </q> And indeed we need only refer the Reader to the ſimple Arguments of <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> and even of <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> for the moſt part too, to convince him that the <hi>Fable</hi> upon the antient Plan of the <hi>Drama</hi> cannot properly be ſaid to be the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Poem in any other Senſe, than as it is the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. Nay, this is in a great Meaſure the Caſe even of thoſe antient <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies</hi> which are of the <hi>implex</hi> Kind, and, as ſuch, eſteemed moſt excellent by our Philoſopher. One main Argument uſed by him for the Priority
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0093400102:373"/>
of the <hi>Fable</hi> in the conſtituent Parts of <hi>Tragedy</hi> is taken from the Conſideration of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Revolutions</hi> and <hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> (the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Ariſt. Poet. Chap. 6.</note>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as he calls them) which diſtinguiſh the <hi>Tragedies</hi> we are ſpeaking of from thoſe of the ſimpleſt Kind. Theſe are the means, ſays he, by which <hi>Tragedy</hi> more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly captivates and engages (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) the Mind and Affections.</p>
                  <p>Now if this Doctrine be applied to the modern <hi>Drama,</hi> it ſeems to me not only an Apology for, but in Effect a Recommendation of the Incidents and Revolutions, which are infinitely more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Stage than they were upon that of <hi>Athens,</hi> and are ſo offenſive to ſqueamiſh Judgments; unleſs it can be proved that theſe under the Direction of a good Judgment do not contribute to, or rather conſtitute that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> plainly refers to in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage quoted; or that ſuch Variety in modern Plays has not a proportionable Influence on the Paſſions, upon which, as Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> rightly has obſerved, it is the Buſineſs of the <hi>Tragic</hi> Muſe "directly to ſtrike."—If therefore the <hi>Fable</hi> be the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> I will venture to aſſert, there is more <hi>Soul</hi> in a good modern <hi>Tragedy,</hi> than in the beſt antient one; and that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> might very properly, and therefore gravely call ſecret
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0093400102:374"/>
Intrigues the <hi>Beauties of our modern Stage.</hi> Indeed that great Man in ſome occaſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks he made on Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi>'s Reflections on the <hi>Tragedies</hi> of <hi>Fletcher,</hi> &amp;c. makes no ſcruple to give the Preference to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets before the <hi>Antients</hi> under this very Article of Enquiry: <q>Next ſhew, ſays he, in what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Tragedy</hi> was deficient; for Example, in the Narrowneſs of it's Plots, and Fewneſs of Perſons, and try whether that be not a Fault in the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets; and whether their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was ſo great, when the Variety was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſo little; or whether what they did was not very eaſy to be done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Oppoſition to this the following Words of the ingenious Author of the <hi>Notes</hi> &amp;c. already referred to, may poſſibly be urged. <q>An Unity, (ſays he, ſpeaking of the two <hi>Dramas)</hi> and even <hi>Simplicity in the Conduct of the Fable is a Perfection in each.</hi> For the Courſe of the <hi>Affections</hi> is diverted and weakened by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of what we call a <hi>double Plot;</hi> and even by a Multiplicity of <hi>ſubordinate Events,</hi> though tending to a common <hi>End;</hi> and, of <hi>Perſons,</hi> though all of them, ſome Way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in promoting it. The like Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhews the Obſervance of this <hi>Rule</hi> to be eſſential in juſt Comedy. For when the <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is ſplit on ſo many interfering Objects, we are not at leiſure to obſerve, nor do we fully
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0093400102:375"/>
enter into the <hi>Truth of Repreſentation</hi> in any of them; the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Humour,</hi> as of the <hi>Pathos,</hi> depending very much on the continued and undiverted Operation of it's <hi>Object</hi> upon us.</q> But in anſwer to this, I will venture to aſſert in my Turn, that the Intervention of what we call a <hi>Double-Plot,</hi> a <hi>competent Number</hi> (not <hi>Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city)</hi> of <hi>ſubordinate Events</hi> tending to a common <hi>End,</hi> and of <hi>Perſons</hi> all of them ſome way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in promoting it, do not weaken, but eaſe and relieve the Courſe of the <hi>Affections;</hi> and alſo, that in <hi>Comedy,</hi> the Attention is really quicken'd even by being ſplit on ſo many interfering Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;—that different and <hi>oppoſite Characters</hi> ſet off and illuſtrate <hi>each other;</hi>—and that we are enabled by a proper <hi>Variety</hi> of Perſonages more preciſely to obſerve and fully to enter into The <hi>Truth of Repreſentation</hi> in <hi>all</hi> of them: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that a <hi>Comedy</hi> with a Double-Plot art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conducted, and fill'd judiciouſly, not cramm'd with Incidents and Intrigue, in which the ſeveral Perſons of the <hi>Drama</hi> have room to exerciſe, and diſplay themſelves, attains it's End, which is the Rotation of <hi>Characters,</hi> and their <hi>ſpecific Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> (as this Author well obſerves) more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, than the ſimple, and contracted <hi>Comedy</hi> of the Antients; but this Matter I have handled more at large <note n="*" place="bottom">See Lectures.</note>elſewhere, and in the mean time

                     <q>I ſhould be loth indeed to ſee Incidents, Buſtle, and Buſineſs ſupply the Place of Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Nature and Pathos.</q> which, 'tis not to be denied, is the Caſe in ſome modern Performances. But that the former are likewiſe very conſiſtent with the latter, and that ſuch Conſiſtency and Union is one great Point of <hi>Dramatic</hi> Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as calculated for the rational Entertainment of an Audience, may be exemplified in many il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Inſtances; particularly in the <hi>Tragedies</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi> It is true this inimitable Poet, is not ſo greatly remarkable for Depth of Plot and Intricacy of Contrivance, as for the Hiſtorical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of his Deſign, (which, by the way, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed carried to an unreaſonable Length in ſome of his Plays) but however, as ſuch Hiſtorical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation neceſſarily implies a great Variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Revolutions, it is fairly reducible to the ſame Head of Diſquiſition. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> indeed, for the moſt part, form'd his Dramatic Plans from Hiſtory, or Romance, and therefore has no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Claim to the Glory of Invention, either as to the Subject of his <hi>Tragedies,</hi> or the Conduct of his Plots. His Excellencies, for the moſt part, are purely Poetical. But this is far from being the Caſe of all our <hi>Dramatic</hi> Writers. The
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0093400102:377"/>
Ground-work of the greateſt part of our <hi>Engliſh Tragedies</hi> is indeed Hiſtorical; but the Superſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is their own. The whole Buſineſs of Plot, Intrigue, and Contrivance, is generally the Work of the Poets; and a Work, when executed with Art and Judgment, that ſhews them to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour at leaſt to their Forefathers of <hi>Greece</hi> in the ample Field of Invention (the firſt Point in Poetry): and therefore I ſhould think ſome of Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s Expreſſions, relating to the kind Aſſiſtance of the Violin to the Diſtreſs of the Hero or the Poet on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Stage, may in ſome meaſure be retorted upon himſelf, and thoſe whoſe Cauſe he eſpouſes. For though an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Space between the Acts may be requiſite for the Purpoſes of the Modern <hi>Drama,</hi> and even to ſave Appearances of the Probability of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, yet I can by no means admit theſe pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Pauſes to be Proofs in themſelves of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs or Barrenneſs of the Writer. Methinks to the Relief of theſe, the antient <hi>Chorus</hi> ſeems more peculiarly adapted, when the <hi>Drama,</hi> by reaſon of the Scantineſs, or if you pleaſe <hi>Simplicity</hi> of it's Matter, and the Narrowneſs of it's Plots, ſtood in abſolute Need of ſuch ſeaſonable and friendly Interpoſition: But to the <hi>Chorus</hi> I am to pay my Compliments again by and by.—</p>
                  <p>It ſhould be obſerv'd here, I am ſuppoſing all this while that, notwithſtanding the Extenſiveneſs
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0093400102:378"/>
of Deſign in modern <hi>Tragedies,</hi> a due, and even ſcrupulous Regard is to be had to Conſiſtency and Uniformity of Plot and Action; That there is to be but one grand central Point as it were, in which the ſeveral Underplots, Incidents, Turns, and Viciſſitudes of the <hi>Drama</hi> are finally to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; and that though the great Buſineſs of the Poet under this Article be to perplex and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs his Audience, and to play with their Paſſions at pleaſure, yet he is to take Care that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling of the whole, and the ſeveral Parts, be eaſy and natural, and the Labyrinths of his Plots ſuch as, according to Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Expreſſion upon another Occaſion, may be juſtly deem'd a <hi>regular Confuſion.</hi> If proper Care and Caution be taken as to theſe particulars, I confeſs I am apt to look upon the Tranſgreſſion of the Letter of the old Laws of <hi>Tragedy</hi> as Offences rather againſt the Cuſtom and Uſage of Antiquity, than the Dictates of Reaſon and Nature; and, as great a Veneration as I have for the antient Poets, cannot poſſibly think I am maintaining an Argument to the prejudice of their real Merit, by endeavouring to aſſert the Liberty of modern Poets, and to reſcue the <hi>Drama</hi> from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Maſon's Third Letter.</note>

almoſt every Compliance with Public Taſte, and the Genius of a People, as mere Complaiſance and Servility: I believe a <hi>Greek</hi> Poet now alive would adapt himſelf to the Taſte of the Times in more Inſtances than Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> would allow; and that theſe have been occaſionally more or leſs conſulted and indulged by all Poets in all Ages. Not that I am of Mr. <hi>Southern</hi>'s Opinion (See his Preface to the <hi>Fatal Marriage)</hi> that every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Man will, and ought to govern in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he pays for; for in ſuch Caſe <hi>Hamlet</hi> muſt walk off the Stage to make room for <hi>Harlequin.</hi>—I would neither ſervilely indulge Public Taſte, nor yet ſelf-ſufficiently deſpiſe it.—I am willing upon this Occaſion once more to ſhelter myſelf under the Authority of <hi>Dryden.</hi>

                     <p>One reaſon of that Succeſs (ſays he in the above-cited Remarks) is in my Opinion this, that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> have written to the Genius of the Age and Nation in which they lived: For though Nature, as he (Mr. <hi>Rymer)</hi> objects, is the ſame in all Places, and Reaſon too the ſame; yet the Climate, the Age, the Diſpoſitions of the People to whom a Poet writes, may be ſo different, that what pleas'd the <hi>Greeks,</hi> would not ſatisfy an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p>And if they proceeded upon a Foundation of truer Reaſon to pleaſe the <hi>Athenians,</hi> than

                        <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it only ſhows that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were a more judicious People: But the Poet's Buſineſs is certainly to pleaſe the Audience.</p>
                     <p>Whether our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Audience have been pleaſed hitherto with Acorns, as he calls it, or with Bread, is the next Queſtion; that is, whether the Means which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> have uſed in their Plays to raiſe thoſe Paſſions before-named, be better applied to the Ends by the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, than by them; and perhaps we ſhall not grant him this wholly.

Countries, according to the Nature of the Climate, and the Conſtitution of the People: However, there are ſome certain, fix'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Principles of Good Senſe, Nature and Reaſon, that are, as Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> obſerves, equally and univerſally, in all Ages and Nations, at leaſt all civilized ones, the ſame: I believe there has been hardly any Age ſo illiterate, whimſical, or corrupted in this Senſe, as to explode theſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles; ſuch for Inſtance, among many others, are the following: That the <hi>Drama</hi> is to be the true Image and Repreſentation of Nature: That this Repreſentation can only be exhibited under an infinite Variety of Actions, Deſigns, Characters, Manners, Sentiments and Expreſſions: That with regard to all, and each of theſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, Conſiſtency, and Probability are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to be obſerved: That the Motives to all Actions, the Springs of all Paſſions, the Grounds of all Prejudices, the Peculiarities of all Tempers, have one common Foundation, and are produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of their correſpondent Effects, in all Times and Places.—The Knowlege of theſe Things is the Knowlege of Nature, in which the great <hi>Arcana</hi> of all Poetry, and particularly <hi>Dramatic,</hi> are repoſited. To theſe, therefore, it is the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic</hi> Poets Care moſt heedfully to attend; and to theſe he may attend, in Fact, very conſiſtently, with a Diſregard of the Laws of the old <hi>Drama,</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0093400102:383"/>
as might be inſtanced in many of our beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Plays, and in almoſt all of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s.—It is, indeed, nothing but this Attention that has ſo eminently raiſed and preſerved the Reputation of theſe latter, notwithſtanding the Poet's abſolute Neglect, or rather Defiance of the great Unities contended for as eſſential to the <hi>Drama.</hi> And 'tis as certain, that where this Attention is wanting, either through Ignorance or Careleſſneſs, the moſt regular Obſervance of theſe Unities will be found utterly inſufficient for the true Purpoſes of Stage-Poetry.</p>
                  <p>For theſe, and the like Reaſons, I think one may venture to conclude, that the Practice of the Antients is by no means a neceſſary Standard of <hi>Dramatic</hi> writing, and that the Laws relating to the ſeveral Unities of Action, Time, and Place, though they do indeed conſtitute a particular Form, or Species of the <hi>Drama,</hi> (and we will grant the moſt <hi>exact</hi> too) yet are by no means eſſential to the Nature of it. Whatever is ſo, cannot be violated or infringed without Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the common Judgment of Mankind, and diſguſting at leaſt, the more rational Part of an Audience. And accordingly every Defect in the Particulars above-mentioned, is always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with proportionable Marks of Diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. But the Caſe is quite different, in reſpect of the Liberties <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has taken, which
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0093400102:384"/>
therefore, I can never think abſurd or unnatural in themſelves. And I am the more confirmed in this Opinion, becauſe <hi>Johnſon, Fletcher,</hi> and many others, who were confeſſedly acquainted with the Genius of ancient <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and, generally ſpeaking, not only affected Art and Regularity in their Writings, but even depended principally upon theſe for the Succeſs of them, did never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, on many Occaſions, hold themſelves free from the Obligation of the Laws at preſent in Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But herein, our modern Refiners will ſay they judged wrong; and as to <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> if he has eſcaped the Severity of Cenſure upon this Head, it muſt be aſcribed wholly to that Complaiſance, which every Generation has thought due to his Excellencies in the <hi>higher Beauties</hi> of Poetry.—Now this Anſwer, (and ſomething to this Effect muſt be the Anſwer) does itſelf ſuppoſe, that the moſt punctual Obſervance of the old Laws, has no Connection with the <hi>great</hi> Beauties of Poetry, but is only at beſt the <hi>mechanical</hi> Part of the <hi>Drama:</hi> However, 'tis preſum'd that the great Name of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> ſcorns to be protected by the Complaiſance of his Countrymen; and that the Liberties he has taken, are very far from being indefenſible.—For is it more improper and irrational, or does it require leſs Force of of Genius, and Knowlege of Nature, to trace as
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0093400102:385"/>
it were a Paſſion from it's firſt Riſe, through it's Progreſs, and to it's final Iſſue, as that of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy in <hi>Othello,</hi> or of Ambition in <hi>Macbeth,</hi> than to repreſent it only at a ſtated Period, and at a particular Criſis? Or, if the Poet thinks proper to ſhift the Scene from a <hi>Palace</hi> to a <hi>Heath,</hi> or from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> is it at all more inconvenient or impoſſible for his Audience to attend him, than it was to give him the Meeting, and ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Place where he laid his firſt Scene? It does not at all appear to me, that a greater Degree of implicit Faith is required in one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than in the other: For he may with equal Probability do both, UT MAGUS, as has been hinted above, and he can do neither but in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſame. Times and Places are in a great Meaſure at the Command of a Genius; and the Argument drawn from the abſolute Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſs of every Breach of exact and preciſe Unity with regard to them, if it proves any Thing, proves too much; it will prove the Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſs of the whole <hi>Dramatic Apparatus;</hi> it will demonſtrate the Impoſſibility of exhibiting Woods, Fields, Caſtles, and Towns, in a ſingle Room, and the Abſurdity of giving an Ear to a Company of Fidlers, before or after the Solemnity of a Council, or the Tumult of a Battle. In ſhort, it ſeems to me a moſt ridiculous <hi>Hypercriticiſm,</hi> to object to Improprieties which are more or leſs
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0093400102:386"/>
inſeparable from the Conſtitution of the <hi>Drama,</hi> and to talk of Inconſiſtencies and Impoſſibilities, where all is confeſſedly a Deluſion. If the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion indeed were, whether of the two be the more <hi>artificial</hi> Model of Tragedy, that of the Ancients, or the Moderns, I would make no Scruple to give up the Argument: But a <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> Model is one Thing, and an <hi>excellent Play</hi> is another; it is one Thing to allow a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Latitude to a great Genius, and another to preſcribe a Plan to a common Poet.</p>
                  <p>Were the antient <hi>Greek Tragedians</hi> defective then in Point of Genius, it will be aſk'd? Very far from it.—However, I will venture to aſſert, that the <hi>Simplicity,</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Poverty)</hi> of their Fables, is by no means their ſtriking Beauty; that theſe would have appeared to greater Advantage, had they taken greater Liberties; that neither Nature nor Reaſon reſtrained them to the preciſe Obſervation of the three Unities, and that the Cuſtom of Antiquity in this Caſe, under the Abilities of a great Maſter, would (to uſe the Words of <hi>Shakeſpear)</hi> be more frequently <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the Breach, than the Obſervance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what if, after all, ſome Precedents even from Antiquity itſelf, will in a certain Meaſure warrant the Non-obſervance of the great Rules in Diſpute? <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who confeſſedly improved the more ſimple Plan of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0093400102:387"/>
                     <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> and are ſuppoſed to have brought the <hi>Drama</hi> to it's State of Perfection, do not ſuperſtitiouſly, and without Exception, adhere to their own general Syſtem: Witneſs firſt, the <hi>Hecuba</hi> of <hi>Euripides;</hi> in which there are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently two diſtinct, and almoſt unconnected Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; at leaſt, out of the two great Incidents of that Tragedy, two diſtinct Actions might have been plan'd; for either the Death of <hi>Polixena,</hi> or the Deſtruction of <hi>Polymneſtor,</hi> might, and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſpeaking ought, to have been the ſimple Subject of that <hi>Drama.</hi> If it be ſaid that both theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (or Incidents) were no more than were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or neceſſary to exemplify the Diſtreſſes of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> and to illuſtrate the Character of that unhappy Princeſs, this is ſaying, in effect, what we have already ſaid, in Defence of the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Plan of modern <hi>Dramatiſts;</hi> and ſo,

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>Sophocles</hi> ought to have ended with it's natural Cataſtrophe, the Death of this Hero; inſtead of which another Action, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, commences, ariſing from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conteſt between <hi>Teucer</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forementioned Hero's Right of Burial; a Conteſt, which, if the Poet in the preſent Caſe had ſtudied, or even regarded abſolute Simplicity and Uniformity, he ſhould have reſerved for the Groundwork of another Tragedy.—And further
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0093400102:388"/>
the <hi>Trachiniae</hi> of the ſame excellent Author is manifeſtly defective in Point of Unity of Time; of which much more muſt naturally be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have lapſed between the Departure of <hi>Hyllus</hi> to inquire after his Father, and his Return to <hi>Trachin</hi> than the Letter of the <hi>Dramatic</hi> Law allowed him.—Theſe Defects and Irregularities I have never ſeen taken Notice of, and much leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to theſe juſtly admired Writers. And though we could bring no other Examples to the ſame Purpoſe than the above cited, or however none ſo obvious as theſe, yet 'tis apprehended a ſingle Inſtance of this Nature is of very conſiderable Weight and Conſequence in the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; and will warrant us in determining that the ſtrict Laws of the <hi>Drama</hi> were not of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Obligation, even in the Judgment of the Antients themſelves.—Indeed if they are, the Merit of a Poet ſhould be tried chiefly at leaſt by them; and therefore when Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> tells us that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ought, for his other Virtues, to be exempted from common Rules, he is unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably candid and indulgent to him; for ſure he ought by no Means to be exempted, if ſuch Rules are founded in the indiſpenſable Laws and firſt Principles of Nature and good Senſe. If he is fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally and eſſentially ridiculous, a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Beauties will not excuſe him. Common Rules are therefore upon certain important Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations diſpenſable; and if ſo, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do not ſo properly excuſe, as acquit him.</p>

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0093400102:389"/>
If the judicious Reader will apply here, by the Way, ſome of the foregoing Remarks to the Caſe of <hi>Tragi-Comedy,</hi> he will be able perhaps to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count not only for the Toleration, but alſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reception of ſo motley a Production upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage. For though <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> with his Contemporaries and many Succeſſors, did in ſuch Pieces undeniably humour the public Taſte to their own Diſcredit, yet 'tis to be obſerved, that the grand <hi>Arcana</hi> of Nature above intimated might be ſcrupulouſly attended to even in this heterogeneous Compoſition; and accordingly when the <hi>Tragic</hi> and <hi>Comic</hi> Repreſentation was each excellent in it's Kind, it is no Wonder that the Bulk of an Audience ſhould overlook the manifeſt Impropriety of the Coalition, or that the more judicious Part ſhould forgive it for the Sake of the fundamental and eſſential Excellencies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Actions and Repreſentations. It is plainly for this Reaſon that the beſt <hi>Tragi-Comedies</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and others are received with general Applauſe at this very Day; the Ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt ſuch <hi>Tragic</hi> and <hi>Comic</hi> Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really not ſo much that it offends the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that it improperly divides the Attention. Two ſeparate Plots, and diſtinct Actions do this to a ridiculous Degree; but in one and the ſame Action abſolute Uniformity is not eſſential either to the <hi>Tragic</hi> or <hi>Comic Drama.</hi> For tho' the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0093400102:390"/>
                     <hi>Pathos</hi> be the Characteriſtic of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> of <hi>Comedy,</hi> as well ancient as modern, yet the former will admit of Characters of Pleaſantry under certain Regulations, and the latter is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently known to abound with Circumſtances of very affecting, tho' domeſtic Diſtreſs; of which many Inſtances might, if need were, be on both ſides produced, in the ſeveral <hi>Dramas</hi> both of Antients and Moderns. Nor does ſuch occaſional and moderate Reciprocation confound or deſtroy the different Genius, Nature, and End, of the two <hi>Species.</hi> And it was probably owing to ſome injudicious Writer's Miſapplication of this Truth, and his drawing undue and falſe Conſequences from it, and even in his own Imagination im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it, that either the Name, or the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Tragi-Comedy</hi> did ever ſubſiſt. For the Reaſons why <hi>Plautus</hi> calls his <hi>Amphitrion</hi> a <hi>Tragi-Comedy,</hi> are of a Nature entirely different from this. However, the great Objection to this Form of <hi>Dramatic</hi> Compoſition is certainly, as has been ſaid, that it unſuitably divides the Attention, not that it leſſens it, or by exciting many different Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the ſame Space of Time checks the Force of any ſingle one. That the Attention in a very uniform and regular Play, may be divided without being leſſened, we have already obſerved; and indeed, if this were not the Caſe, abſolute Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Simplicity muſt be really eſſential to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0093400102:391"/>
the two <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>Drama,</hi> and every reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Participation will be proportionably, to the Degree of it, abſurd. But to aſſert this, would be talking againſt Reaſon, Experience, and the not uncommon Practice of the beſt Poets. Is any Man leſs mov'd by the Delicacy and Tenderneſs of Lord <hi>Townley,</hi> upon his Separation from his Wife, on Account of the Mirth that was before excited in him, by the ridiculous Ignorance, and Ruſticity of Sir <hi>Francis Wronghead?</hi> Do we leſs intereſt ourſelves in the Fate of the unhappy <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> becauſe we were diverted by the cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combical Pertneſs of Mr. <hi>Thomas?</hi> Should we be more affected by the pathetical Complaints of <hi>Romeo,</hi> if they were not contraſted in the Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonery of <hi>Mercutio?</hi> Or, to refer the Reader to a Play or two written directly upon the <hi>Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comic</hi> Plan, does the iniquitous Drollery of the <hi>Spaniſh Friar</hi> abate our Concern for the Diſtreſſes of <hi>Torriſmond</hi> and <hi>Leonora?</hi> Or, do the comical <hi>Rhodomontades,</hi> and Humours of <hi>Falſtaff</hi> and his Aſſociates, take off our Attention from the Bravery of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Hotſpur,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. at the Battle of <hi>Shrewſbury.</hi>—I am very far from contending for this Mixture, not of oppoſite, but indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Characters, in the ſame <hi>Drama,</hi> and much leſs for the Form of <hi>Tragi-Comedy</hi> itſelf: Proper and due Uniformity admits of ſufficient Variety, and though it be not eſſential to the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0093400102:392"/>
                     <hi>Drama,</hi> is no doubt a great Beauty in it: The moſt popular of the Plays I have mentioned, are not the better for their Medley of Characters; but all this while, let the Fault or Impropriety be placed in a fair Light, and aſcrib'd to it's true Cauſe, which is the real, though nice Connection, between the Genius of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and that of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> and the extreme Difficulty of preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining how far, or in what Degrees and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions the one may aſſume the Qualities and Properties of the other.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my Subject:—The ſimple Conſtitution of the ancient <hi>Drama,</hi> has indeed ſome Advantages over the more complicated one of ſucceeding Ages, but ſtill ſuch as are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more than ballanc'd by thoſe of the latter. The frequent ſhifting of Scenes, for Inſtance, though it does not offend the Judgment, is yet diſguſting to the Eye of the Spectator, and ſo far the Continuation of one and the ſame Scene, is a peculiar Beauty, and Propriety. But all this while, to this Beauty and local Propriety, many other more important Points of Probability are too often ſacrific'd. This is, more or leſs, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Caſe of all ſtrictly uniform <hi>Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Comedies,</hi> but evidently, at leaſt of ſome of our beſt <hi>Engliſh Comedies</hi> that have been written on the old <hi>Dramatic</hi> Plan; in which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Unity of Action, ſo much Buſineſs is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0093400102:393"/>
tranſacted, ſo much Intrigue carried on, by ſo many different Perſonages, in one ſingle Spot of Ground, as is utterly incredible; in which Caſe the Poet <hi>really</hi> offends againſt Reaſon, Nature, and good Senſe, purely to ſave the <hi>Appearance</hi> of doing ſo: Indeed if the Unities are eſſential to the <hi>Drama,</hi> the utmoſt Simplicity will of Courſe be a Perfection in it; and conſequently many of the moſt regular Compoſitions of our <hi>Comic</hi> Poets (as <hi>the Way of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Double Dealer</hi> of <hi>Congreve)</hi> will be found to be infinitely their worſt Productions: So ambitious have ſome been of improving the Model of the antient <hi>Drama,</hi> and yet ſo cautious at the ſame Time of taking ſuch Liberties as were abſolutely neceſſary for thoſe Improvements.</p>
                  <p>After all, Diſcretion is to be a general Rule even in the Uſe of Liberty. I would neither fetter the <hi>Dramatic</hi> Muſe, nor yet let her run wild; Deviations from the ſtrict Laws of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhould be made not affectedly and at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but with a View to Beauties of a higher Nature; not for the Eaſe of the Poet, but to the Advantage of the Poem. I would not vindicate <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> himſelf in every Inſtance of his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. To ſum up all that need be ſaid upon this Point in a few Words; the old Laws of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are in my Opinion very proper Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reſtraints for an indifferent Poet, but ought not to be the Shackles of a good one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0093400102:394"/>
The other great Point of Difference between the antient and modern <hi>Drama,</hi> is the Diſuſe of the <hi>Chorus</hi> in the latter; which yet Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> is "willing to think eſſential to the Tragic <hi>Drama."</hi> Now admitting the Theory of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> to be not only a regular, but alſo neceſſary Standard of <hi>Dramatic</hi> Writings, with Reſpect to the Unities of Action, Time and Place, the <hi>Chorus,</hi> though not eſſential to the <hi>Drama,</hi> will indeed as Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> obſerves <q>lay a proper and neceſſary Reſtraint upon the Poet.</q> But if theſe Unities themſelves are far from being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the <hi>Drama,</hi> as we have endeavoured to make it appear, the Uſe of the <hi>Chorus</hi> is ſo far at leaſt ſuperſeded.—The <hi>Chorus</hi> was indeed, as I have before obſerved, not only a conſtituent Part of, but even a Convenience to the antient <hi>Tragedy.</hi> If I might be excuſed the Indelicacy of the Expreſſion for the Significancy of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I would ſay, let a <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> be <hi>gutted</hi> of it's <hi>Chorus,</hi> and you leave it little better than a <hi>Skeleton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proceed; upon the ſimple Plan of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity the <hi>Chorus</hi> introduced, 'tis true, an agreeable Variety into the <hi>Drama,</hi> and was no doubt both uſeful and ornamental to it, as it's peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had more immediate Reference to the great Ends of all Poetry, <hi>prodeſſe &amp; delectare.</hi> But after all, if theſe great Ends are better, or even as well
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0093400102:395"/>
anſwered without the <hi>Chorus;</hi> and if theſe Ends are not obſtructed by the Admiſſion of Deſign, Contrivance and Intrigue into the Fable, but even promoted by it under the Conduct of a maſterly Hand, in this Caſe, I ſay, it is not to be denied but the <hi>Chorus</hi> of the Antients has given Place to it's Betters.—It is true Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> has very poſitively aſſerted (for I think he has by no Means ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved) in Behalf of the old <hi>Chorus,</hi> that (to lay no Streſs upon ſubordinate Advantages) it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the <hi>Pathetic,</hi> that it afforded <q>a graceful, and natural Reſource to the Embelliſhments of pictureſque Deſcription, ſublime Allegory, and whatever elſe comes under the Denomination of pure Poetry;</q> and laſtly, which is moſt material, that it was the propereſt Vehicle <q>to convey mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reflections with Grace and Propriety.</q> For theſe Reaſons, which reſpect both the <hi>Poet</hi> and the <hi>Audience,</hi> he judges the Diſuſe of the <hi>Chorus</hi> to be an irreparable Loſs to the modern Stage. Let us briefly then review what this Gentleman has ſaid upon each of theſe Articles.</p>
                  <p>Now with Regard to the firſt he offers us the Authority of a <hi>Frenchman.</hi> 
                     <q>If you aſk me (ſays he) how it augmented the <hi>Pathetic,</hi> I cannot give you a better Anſwer than the <hi>Abbè Vatry</hi> has done in his Diſſertation on the Subject pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the <hi>Memoirs de l' Acad. des Inſer.</hi> &amp;c. It affected this (ſays he) both in it's <hi>Odes</hi> and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0093400102:396"/>
                        <hi>Dialogue.</hi> The wonderful Power of Muſic and the Dance is univerſally allowed. And, as theſe were always <hi>Accompaniments</hi> to the Odes, there is no Doubt but they contributed greatly to move the Paſſions. It was neceſſary that there ſhould be Odes or Interludes; but it was alſo neceſſary, that theſe Interludes ſhould not ſuffer the Minds of the Audience to cool, but, on the contrary, ſhould ſupport and fortify thoſe Paſſions, which the previous Scenes had already excited. Nothing imaginable could produce this Effect better, than the choral Songs and Dances, which filled the Mind with Ideas correſponding to the Subject, and never failed to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Perſonages. In the Dialogue alſo, the Chorus ſerved to move the Paſſions by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spectators other Spectators ſtrongly affected by the Action. A Spectacle of ſuch a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Paſſions of <hi>Terrour</hi> and <hi>Pity,</hi> will not of itſelf ſo ſtrongly affect us, as when we ſee others alſo affected by it. The Painters have generally underſtood this Secret, and have had Recourſe to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient ſimilar to that of the <hi>Chorus</hi> of the Poets. Not content with the ſimple Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an hiſtorical Event, they have alſo added Groupes of aſſiſtant Figures, and expreſt in their Faces the different Paſſions, they would
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0093400102:397"/>
have their Picture excite. Nay they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inliſt into their Service even irrational Animals. In the <hi>Slaughter of the Innocents,</hi> LE BRUN was not ſatisfied with expreſſing all the Horrour, of which the Subject is naturally capable; he has alſo painted two Horſes with their Hair ſtanding on End, and ſtarting back, as afraid to trample upon the bleeding Infants. This is an Artifice which has often been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and which has always ſucceeded. A good Poet ſhould do the ſame; and <hi>Iphigenia</hi> ſhould not be ſuffered to appear on the Theatre, without being accompanied with Perſons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of feeling her Misfortunes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have tranſcribed the whole Paſſage, and can't help nothing in the firſt Place, a very extraordinary Inaccuracy in this refin'd Portion of Criticiſm. For ſure the above-mentioned Horſes, with their "Hair ſtanding on End," and "ſtarting back," &amp;c. did greatly add to the Horrour of this famous Piece, which yet before had, it ſeems, all the Horrour expreſſed in it, of which the Subject was naturally capable; or, if they did not aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Horrour, it will be difficult methinks to to tell what Buſineſs they had there. But to be ſerious:</p>
                  <p>The wonderful Power of Muſic is univerſally allow'd; and Muſic is by no Means excluded from the modern Stage. Nay, I venture to ſay, the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0093400102:398"/>
modern <hi>Drama</hi> has Recourſe to it more effectually, though leſs frequently, than the old <hi>Drama</hi> had; as we are more affected by it's occaſional and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Graces and Aſſiſtances, than we ſhould be by it's ſtated and periodical Interpoſition.—For the <hi>Dance,</hi> I own I am at a Loſs to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how it could contribute greatly to move the Paſſions; I mean the Paſſions proper for Tragedy: I do not pretend to aſcertain the Nature and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the antient <hi>Stage-Dancing;</hi> but ſuch has been the Power of the <hi>Dance</hi> in later Times, that the <hi>Tragic Muſe,</hi> who is a very <hi>grave Matron,</hi> has, I believe, no Reaſon to lament her <hi>dancing Days are over.</hi> Admitting therefore at preſent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and Efficacy of the <hi>Choral</hi> Songs, I cannot conceive how any Kind of <hi>Dance</hi> 
                     <q>ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and fortify thoſe Paſſions, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Scenes had excited,</q> or <q>fill the Mind with Ideas correſponding to the Subject, and never fail to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Perſonages.</q> Nor farther can I ſee any Thing even in the <hi>Songs,</hi> or <hi>Odes,</hi> which had ſo peculiar a Tendency to produce theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that nothing imaginable could do it <hi>as well;</hi> for tho' theſe might anſwer this Purpoſe very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, yet if they were not neceſſary for it, they cannot be contended for as eſſential to the <hi>Drama,</hi> and muſt conſequently be conſidered only, as we have before obſerved, in the Light of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0093400102:399"/>
an ancient Conveniency.—Now I apprehend the Minds of the Audience are in no Danger of cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the preſent Syſtem of the <hi>Drama,</hi> and that the Muſic between the Acts <hi>may</hi> be adapted to the Purpoſes fore-named, of ſupporting and fortifying the Paſſions as much as the old <hi>Chorus</hi> could be. Without depreciating therefore the real Uſe and Deſign of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> we only ſay we can do in many Reſpects better, and even in this as well without it.</p>
                  <p>But farther it ſeems, <q>In the Dialogue alſo, the <hi>Chorus</hi> ſerved to move the Paſſions, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spectators, other Spectators ſtrongly affected by the Action.</q> For, <q>a Spectacle of ſuch a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Paſſions of Terrour, and Pity, will not of itſelf ſo ſtrongly affect us, as when we ſee others alſo affected by it.</q> Admitting the Truth of which Aſſertion, I do not ſee what is to be inferr'd from it to the Advantage of the antient <hi>Chorus.</hi> For does not the modern <hi>Drama</hi> move the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (as indeed does the antient excluſive of it's <hi>Chorus)</hi> by ſhewing to the Spectators other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (not mere Spectators, but Perſons more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Action) ſtrongly affected by the Events of the <hi>Tragedy?</hi> The Intervention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Spectators, as ſuch, upon the Stage is with Reſpect to this Purpoſe ſuperfluous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, except it can be demonſtrated that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0093400102:400"/>
the Paſſions of Terrour and Pity, or any other are (if I may be allowed the Expreſſion) more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excited at the <hi>ſecond Rebound.</hi>—Let common Experience at once illuſtrate and determine this Matter.—Suppoſing half a dozen indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons admitted to a Spectacle of Terrour or Diſtreſs in real Life, for Inſtance that of a dying Man taking Leave of his Wife, his Miſtreſs, or his Friend; would not ſuch a Spectacle immediately raiſe ſuitable Emotions in all of them, or would each firſt conſult the Paſſions of his next Neighbour in order to learn what Effect this Spectacle ought to have upon himſelf? Theſe Queſtions require no Anſwer; and therefore as the <hi>Drama</hi> is ſo lively a Repreſentation of real Life, they may plainly be applied to any Caſe of Miſery or Horrour exhibited upon the Stage.—For this Reaſon alſo it is, that the Illuſtration of the Matter before us by the Expedients of the Painters is, I apprehend, (with Deference to the ingenious <hi>Abbè</hi> as Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> calls him) entirely foreign to the preſent Purpoſe. The Painters have very wiſely had Recourſe to ſuch Expedients as are mentioned in the above-quoted Criticiſm, becauſe, after all, their Art is but Painting ſtill, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking deſcribes the Paſſions, more than it excites them; but the <hi>Drama,</hi> or rather the <hi>Actor</hi> in the <hi>Drama, realizes</hi> what he repreſents. He muſt be a very inſenſible Spectator, who thinks at
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0093400102:401"/>
all of the <hi>Poet</hi> or the <hi>Player,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> is perſonating a <hi>Richard,</hi> a <hi>Macbeth,</hi> or a <hi>Lear.</hi> The Poet in ſhort has not the ſame Occaſion for ſuch Artifices and Expedients as the Painter has. Let <hi>Iphigenia</hi> appear on the Theatre, and behave as ſhe ought to do, and I will be anſwerable for it, the <hi>Audience</hi> will be <hi>Perſons capable of feeling her Misfortunes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But again, by rejecting the <hi>Chorus</hi> Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> tells us the true Poet has loſt a <q>graceful and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reſource to the Embelliſhments of Pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque Deſcription, ſublime Allegory, and whatever elſe comes under the Denomination of <hi>pure Poetry.</hi>
                     </q> To which I take Leave to reply, That what the <hi>Poet</hi> has loſt hereby, <hi>Tragedy</hi> has gained; for if Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s own Theory be juſt, the <hi>Tragic Muſe</hi> (as we have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from him) ſtrikes directly upon the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the Audience; which I ſhould be glad to know how Pictureſque Deſcription (I mean ſuch as this Gentleman has favoured us with) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Allegory, and <hi>Poetry in the Abſtract,</hi> or, if you pleaſe, <hi>pure Poetry</hi> can do. Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> ſays, the <hi>Lyric Muſe</hi> addreſſes herſelf to the Imagination of a Reader or Hearer; and accordingly <q>few Men have a Strength of Imagination capable of purſuing the Flights of <hi>Pindar;</hi>
                     </q> and ſtill fewer, I will venture to add, thoſe of Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> in this Dramatic Poem. I am very far from meaning to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0093400102:402"/>
decry this ingenious Author's peculiar Talent <hi>in loco;</hi> but I fear in the preſent Caſe, while he affects to defend the Cauſe of the <hi>old Chorus,</hi> his real Deſign was to introduce a <hi>new</hi> one. For, the Name excepted, I can diſcern little or nothing in the <hi>Odes</hi> of Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> ſimilar to thoſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Chorus;</hi> that <q>poetical Flow of tender Commiſeration, of religious Supplication, or of virtuous Triumph,</q> of which it principally conſiſted, had none of the <hi>long-ſpun</hi> Allegory, and <hi>aerial</hi> Imagery with which theſe <hi>Dramatic</hi> Sonnets of Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> abound. In Truth it is to be wiſh'd that this profeſt Admirer, and Imitator of genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Nature, and antient Simplicity in the <hi>Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of his <hi>Fable,</hi> had paid a little more Regard to them in his <hi>Diction</hi> throughout this whole Poem, and particularly in the Stile of the <hi>Choral</hi> Compoſitions under preſent Conſideration.

In another Ode we have ſeveral <hi>pictureſque</hi> Images of the Goddeſs CONTENT, preſented to us; now ſhe ſits upon a Bank, and liſtens to a Linnet.</p>

                  <p>—It is wonderful to obſerve how far a true <hi>Poetic</hi> Fancy lifts a Genius above all <hi>Proſaic</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Moſt of us profeſs ourſelves Admirers of the <hi>Naked Truth;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> has cloth'd her more ſplendidly than ever <hi>Solomon</hi> was; tho' I think he has given her rather too fine a <hi>Buckle</hi> for ſo clumſy a <hi>Girdle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is indeed well obſerv'd by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> that He who would take Boldneſs from Poetry, muſt leave Dulneſs in the room of it; and I am very ſenſible that no Species of Poetry is allow'd greater Liberties than the <hi>Ode;</hi>

SED NON UT PLACIDIS COEUNT IMMITIA, &amp;C. Boldneſs is the Medium between <hi>Dulneſs</hi> and <hi>Temerity;</hi> the Muſe has no more Buſineſs above the <hi>Clouds,</hi> than ſhe has under the <hi>Ground;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> tho' he never <hi>creeps,</hi> is certainly a <hi>High-Flyer.</hi> The extravagant Thoughts, the far-fetch'd Alluſions, and the unconnected Ideas in moſt of theſe <hi>Odes</hi> are a Proof of it.—In truth the Heat of Imagination is apt to tranſport an Author into falſe Concluſions, and make him believe He writes <hi>Poetry,</hi> becauſe He does not write <hi>Proſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But farther, I can by no Means agree with Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> that <q>if we had a <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s form'd on the <hi>Greek</hi> Model, we ſhould find in it more frequent, if not nobler In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the high Poetical Capacity, than in any ſingle Compoſition he has left us.</q> This Author thinks, <q>we have a Proof of this in thoſe parts of his Hiſtorical Plays, which are call'd <hi>Chorus's,</hi> and written in the common Dialogue Metre.</q> Our <q>Imagination (continues he) will eaſily conceive, how fine an Ode the Deſcription of the Night, preceding the Battle of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> would have made in his Hands; and what additional Grace it would receive from that Form of Compoſition.</q> Let us turn to the Deſcription as it now ſtands in <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>

                  <p>—This noble Deſcription is full of Imagery drawn from ſenſible Objects, as indeed are moſt of thoſe we meet with in this incomparable Author; (witneſs for Inſtance the Deſcription of <hi>Dover Cliff,</hi> of <hi>Hamlet's Madneſs,</hi> of <hi>Brutus's Diſorder,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.) It is conſequently of the moſt affecting Nature, and in a manner poſſeſſes the Hearer or the Reader with the ſame kind of Terrour which the Braveſt probably feel upon the Criſis of a deciſive Battle. And, by the by, of the ſame paſſionate and affecting (i. e. <hi>Dramatic Nature)</hi> are the Poetical Parts of our beſt <hi>Tragedies</hi> in general.

—It is certain whatever might be the Myſtic Beauties of ſuch an <hi>Ode</hi> as this, it would at beſt be a <hi>diſpaſſionate</hi> One, and ſo far infinitely leſs <hi>Theatrical,</hi> than the foregoing Deſcription of <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi> In truth the <hi>pure Poetry</hi> which Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> tells us that great Poet had the Power of introducing naturally, and what is moſt ſtrange, of joining with <hi>pure Paſſion,</hi> has an Air utterly different from, or rather contrary to the Flights of Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> throughout this Performance. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> indeed very rarely gets out of the Reach of our Apprehenſions, even when his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject leads him directly into the Province of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.—I refer the Reader to his <hi>Midſummer Night's Dream,</hi> his <hi>Macbeth,</hi> and his <hi>Tempeſt.</hi> Upon the whole of this Article, it may I think, be ſafely affirm'd that the modern <hi>Drama</hi> is by no means deſtitute of Opportunities of having recourſe to Poetical Embelliſhments and <hi>Pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque</hi> Deſcriptions of all Kinds; and it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to them, if not ſo frequently and obviouſly

                  <p>In ſhort, to this <hi>Spirit</hi> we may perhaps aſcribe the Impropriety and <hi>Unſeaſonableneſs</hi> of ſome of Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s moſt elegant and affecting Images and Deſcriptions.—But I forbear to multiply Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.—Enough, I preſume, has been ſaid to ſhew that Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> throughout this whole Work diſcovers much more of the <hi>Poet,</hi> than the <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi> He diſcovers ſo much indeed of the former, that abating theſe, and a few other Blemiſhes and Defects, which I thought it but Juſtice to my Subject to endeavour to ſet in a true Light, <hi>Elfrida,</hi> as a <hi>Dramatic Poem,</hi> has many exquiſite Beauties; which however (as they muſt be obvious to judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0093400102:413"/>
Eyes) I forbear not for Want of Inclination but of Time to recite. Indeed as this Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is entitled a <hi>Dramatic Poem,</hi> and not a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> by the Author himſelf, I ſhould have made no Exceptions to it, if the <hi>Stile</hi> of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> prefixed to the <hi>Drama</hi> had been as <hi>modeſt</hi> as the <hi>Title Page.</hi>—But to return once more to the <hi>Chorus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> 
                     <q>laments that with the Means of introducing Poetry naturally, is loſt alſo the Opportunity of conveying moral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections with Grace and Propriety.</q>—He tells us afterwards, <q>that in thoſe Parts of the <hi>Drama</hi> where the Judgment of a mixt Audience is moſt liable to be miſled by what paſſes before it's View, the chief Actors are generally too much agitated by the furious Paſſions, or too much attached by the tender ones, to think cooly, and impreſs on the Spectators a moral Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly.</q>—This is indeed aſſerting roundly, but however, I apprehend, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Foundation in Reaſon, or Experience.—I will make bold to aſſert too, that it is the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Dramatic</hi> Poet (and indeed of every other) in a <hi>moral</hi> View to ſteal imperceptibly into the Heart of his Audience, or Reader; that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents <hi>occaſionally</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> ſuggeſted by the Circumſtances of the Parties perſonally concerned, will have a more forcible Effect than a thouſand <hi>ſet Leſſons</hi> of <hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> from the Mouth of a third Perſon; and that the chief Actors are
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0093400102:414"/>
                     <hi>not</hi> generally "too much agitated by the furious Paſſions, or attached by the tender ones, to think cooly (enough for the Purpoſe) and impreſs on the Spectators a moral Sentiment properly."</p>
                  <p>In the next Sentence we are told that <q>A Confidant or Servant has ſeldom Senſe enough to do it, never Dignity enough to be regarded.</q>—Now, by the way, a Servant or a Confidant may always (if the Poet pleaſe) be as ſenſible a Perſon as any in the <hi>Drama;</hi> and ſure the Dignity of either, at leaſt of the latter is equal to that of the Perſonages of the antient <hi>Chorus,</hi> which for the moſt Part conſiſted of a Company of Virgins, the Attendants and Countrywomen of the Hero of the Poem.—Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s own <hi>Chorus,</hi> with all it's Pomp and Solemnity, is compoſed of Lord <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi>'s <hi>Maids.</hi>—But after all, do the modern <hi>Tragedians</hi> uſually convey moral Sentiments thro' the Mouths of <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Confidants,</hi> as theſe Expreſſions would lead us to imagine; or granting they do, and err in ſo doing, is the particular Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of a few to be objected to the general Syſtem? Inſtead therefore of theſe (and of the <hi>Chorus</hi> too) the Moderns are <q>ſufficiently provided with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not merely capable of ſeeing and hearing, but of arguing, adviſing, and reflecting; from whom a moral Sentiment never comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally, but ſuitably and gracefully.</q> For ſuch are (or may be) all the <hi>Perſons</hi> in the <hi>Drama.</hi> "The Character of <hi>Pierre</hi> in <hi>Venice Preſerv'd</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0093400102:415"/>
(Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> juſtly obſerves in another Place) <q>when left entirely to the Judgment of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is perhaps one of the moſt improper for public View, that ever was produced on any Stage. It is almoſt impoſſible, but ſome Part of the Spectators ſhould go from the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with very falſe and immoral Impreſſions. But had that <hi>Tragedy</hi> been written on the antient Plan; had <hi>Pierre</hi>'s Character been drawn juſt as it is, and ſome few Alterations made in <hi>Jaffeir</hi>'s, I know no two Characters more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing Service in a moral View, when juſtly animadverted upon by the <hi>Chorus.</hi> For bad Characters become on this Plan as harmleſs in the Hands of the Poet, as the Hiſtorian.</q> This would indeed be, as I have elſewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, very juſt Reaſoning againſt any Man that ſhould undertake to vindicate Mr. <hi>Otway</hi>'s Conduct in the <hi>Tragedy</hi> referred to; and to oppoſe the <hi>ſame</hi> to the <hi>antient Plan;</hi> but as this never was, or will be done by any Man in his Senſes, it is ſurely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive to argue againſt the Inconveniencies of the whole modern <hi>Dramatic</hi> Syſtem from the <hi>particular</hi> Error of a <hi>particular</hi> Poet.—The Truth is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this Gentleman has conceived ſtrong Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in Favour of that <hi>Species</hi> of Poetry, which his Talent evidently leads him to; for if he had not himſelf a particular <hi>Taſte</hi> for an <hi>Ode,</hi> 'tis likely he would ſcarce contend for it as abſolutely eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0093400102:416"/>
to the <hi>Drama.</hi>—But whatever may have been his real Sentiments upon the Occaſion, I hope, I have given ſufficient Reaſons for differing from him.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclue I can't help taking Notice, that Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> has drawn Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himſelf into his Intereſts in a very extraordinary Manner; and this I do the rather, as I have more than once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that excellent Perſon's Authority. Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> among the inſuperable Difficulties in the Way to the deſired Reformation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage, intimates the preſent improper Form of the <hi>Theatres;</hi> and the additional Expence requiſite for the Purpoſes of the antient Syſtem renders the Matter, he thinks, impracticable. <q>This, he ſays, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> foreſaw long ago;</q> and then quotes the following curious Paſſage from him. <q>A new Theatre, much more ample and much deeper, muſt be made for that Purpoſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Coſt of ſometimes forty or fifty Habits: which is an Expence too large to be ſupplied by a Company of Actors. 'Tis true I ſhould not be ſorry to ſee a <hi>Chorus</hi> on a Theatre, more than as large and as deep again as our's, built and adorned at a King's Charges; and on that Condition, and another, which is, that my Hands were not bound behind me, as now they are, I ſhould not deſpair of making ſuch a Tragedy, as might be both inſtructive and delightful, according to the Manner of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0093400102:417"/>
Now does any common Reader apprehend from this Paſſage, that becauſe Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> tells us, he ſhould not be ſorry to ſee a <hi>Chorus</hi> on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Theatre, &amp;c. therefore he ardently wiſh'd to ſee one, and judg'd it abſolutely eſſential to the <hi>Drama;</hi> or becauſe he declares that in ſuch Caſe he ſhould not <hi>deſpair</hi> of making ſuch a Tragedy as <hi>might</hi> be inſtructive and delightful according to the Manner of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> therefore he <hi>long'd</hi> to try his Strength in this Field, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the grand Secret <hi>prodeſſe &amp; delectare</hi> was the Characteriſtic of the <hi>Greek Drama</hi> only? And yet ſuch methinks is Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Paſſage."—<q>This Suffrage of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> ſays he, is, however, very appoſite to to the preſent Point. But it ſerves alſo to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my Deſign of imitating the Greek Drama. For if he, who was ſo prejudiced to the modern Stage, as to think Intrigue a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Beauty in it; if he, I ſay, owns that the grand Secret <hi>prodeſſe &amp; delectare</hi> was the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of the Greek Drama only, nothing I think can better juſtify my preſent Attempt than the Approbation he gives to it in this Paſſage.</q>—That is (to reduce this Suffrage to a ſmaller Compaſs) Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> informs us, that if Things were properly circumſtanced he would at all Events have attempted a <hi>Tragedy</hi> upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Model, and with <hi>ſome Hopes</hi> of Succeſs;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0093400102:418"/>
therefore he <hi>plainly preferred</hi> the <hi>antient</hi> to the <hi>modern</hi> Syſtem.—Let the Merits of the Cauſe be tried by the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> and
<q>
                        <l>Fabio vel Judice vincam.</l>
                     </q>
I have nothing farther to add than that, if the Reader ſhould chance to wonder at the Freedom I have ſometimes taken with this truly ingenious Writer, I deſire it may be imputed to my natural Reſentment of that Air of Sufficiency and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority with which he introduces, I do not ſay his Performance, but his Syſtem.—<q>Good Senſe (i. e. <hi>common Senſe)</hi> as well as Antiquity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Adherence to the Unities.</q> This peremptory Declaration involves in a very ſcurvy Term almoſt every Dramatic Writer but our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or two, ſince the Days of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But delicate Judgment it ſeems and a true Taſte for <hi>genuine Nature</hi> and <hi>antient Simplicity</hi> are the Allotments, and Privileges only of a happy Few.—In what Contempt does this Gentleman hold the univerſal Practice of the <hi>modern</hi> Stage, when he acquaints us, "he believes he could quickly make the whole tolerably fit for an Engliſh Audience by putting the Dialogue of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> into the Mouth of an <hi>Emma</hi> or <hi>Matilda,</hi> who with ſome little Shew of ſiſterly Concernment, might be eaſily made to claim Kindred with <hi>Earl Athelwold;</hi> and by the Addition of an
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0093400102:419"/>
unneceſſary Incident or two, which would coſt him no more than they are worth in contriving, and an unmeaning Perſonage or two, who would be as little Expence in creating." I confeſs I ſee no Sort of Foundation for this Inſult and Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Arguments, or rather Aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> for which Reaſon I have written my Thoughts upon this Occaſion; otherwiſe I have no more Pretenſion to write againſt him as an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> than Deſire to enter the Liſts with him as a <hi>Poet.</hi>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Sit down, in compliance with your Requeſt, to give you my Sentiments upon the Subject ſtarted at our laſt Interview.—In conſequence of my Reſearches upon this Occaſion I have been almoſt led into a very whimſical Concluſion,—that the greateſt Genius is the Author a Man happens to have in his Hand. It ſeems but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to pin our Opinion of an Author upon that of his Editor, or Tranſlator; and yet we may do this, till we are in a manner at a loſs for a Criterion to judge good Writing by. Genius aſſumes as many Shapes as ever <hi>Proteus</hi> did; and all literary Merit conſiſts principally in Invention, in Judgment, in Fire, in Propriety, in Simplicity, in Elegance, in Accuracy, in Eaſe, in Wit, in Humour, in Fullneſs, in Brevity, &amp;c. &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, and Complexion of the Writer before me. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> declares, <hi>Homer</hi> was the greateſt <hi>Epic</hi> Poet in the World, and I
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0093400102:422"/>
am quite of his Mind, till I take up Mr. <hi>Mey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s <hi>Tryphiodorus.</hi>—When I look into my <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> I begin to think <hi>Virgil</hi> was a very cold, and inſipid Writer; and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Acquaintance aſſure me that <hi>Statius</hi> was little better than a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—In ſhort by Virtue of the Preface, prefix'd to him, <hi>Sophocles</hi> or <hi>Ovid, Terence</hi> or <hi>Martial, Milton</hi> or <hi>Butler,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. is the beſt Poet; <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> or <hi>Eutropius, Livy</hi> or <hi>Salluſt, Rapin</hi> or <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi> is the beſt Hiſtorian; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Newton, Deſcartes</hi> or <hi>Burnet,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. is the beſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher; and <hi>Hammond</hi> or <hi>Hobbes, South,</hi> or <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sherlock</hi> or <hi>Middleton</hi> is the beſt Divine.—</p>
                  <p>But to be ſerious.—You will wonder perhaps to be told, that what gave Riſe to theſe ludicrous Remarks of mine was nothing leſs than Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Commentary upon his univerſally, and juſtly admir'd Original, <hi>Homer;</hi> an Author, whom you will ſcarce think capable of being compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, or aggrandiz'd to an undue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Degree, eſpecially by ſo judicious an Editor.—Indeed theſe great Names are ſo truly venerable, that I muſt obviate the Alarm you may take, by aſſuring you that what I am going to ſay neither can, nor means to detract from the infinite Merit of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> or the <hi>Britiſh Homer;</hi> for the former, <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Note at v. 955 of the 16th B. of the Iliad.</note>
                     <q>I believe upon the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0093400102:423"/>
whole that ſcarce any Mortal ever came near him for Wiſdom, Learning, and all good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</q> for the latter, He has certainly done more Juſtice to his Author as an Expoſitor only, than all the Commentators, antient and modern, put together. After this Declaration you will give me leave to tell you, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf appears to me, notwithſtanding his very great Abilities, to have ſometimes miſapprehended the real Deſign of his Original, to have not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (to uſe his own Words again) <q>attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him what does not belong to him,</q> and now and then to have imagin'd Proprieties, or cover'd Defects with a ſeeming View rather to the Honour of his Author at all Events, than to the preciſe Aſcertainment of Truth. All this, indeed, might be owing not to a blind Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to a Want of Diſcernment, but to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of laudable Partiality, or a too implicit Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Notions, and Interpretations of the Commentators his Predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p>But whatever may be allow'd to an Editor, or Tranſlator, a Stander-by will be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and is, as ſuch, more likely to think juſtly of an Author. You who turn to your <hi>Homer</hi> merely with an Intent to be delighted with him, and conſider Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> as a Perſon very able and willing to illuſtrate his great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Excellencies, will be apt to ſce no
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0093400102:424"/>
Grounds for the above Allegations, but in an Affectation of Singularity, or in Caprice; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> makes no Scruple occaſionally to point out the Blemiſhes of his Author, and ſeems by many Remarks to ſhew himſelf thoroughly diveſted of all unreaſonable Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Note at V. 801. B. xi.</note> It is cuſtomary (ſays he) with thoſe who tranſlate or comment on an Author, to uſe him as they do their Miſtreſs; they can ſee no Faults, or convert his very Faults into Beauties; but I cannot be ſo partial to <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> In another Place after having enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated what ſeem'd to him to be <q>Faults of any conſideration,</q> he tells us, <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Note at V. 955. B. xvi.</note>
                     <q>he hopes after ſo free a Confeſſion no reaſonable Modern will think him touch'd with the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> and others. I am ſenſible, continues he, of the Extremes which Mankind run into, in extolling and depreciating Authors: We are not more violent and unreaſonable in attacking thoſe who are not yet eſtabliſh'd into Fame, than in defending thoſe who are, even in every minute Trifle.</q>—There is as much Modeſty as there is Truth in this ingenuous Declaration; and there is great Reaſon to ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> in general never ſpeaks of <hi>Homer</hi> in higher Terms than he really believ'd he deſerves.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0093400102:425"/>
However, whether I have been actuated by a Spirit of Vanity, or of Humour, rather than juſt Criticiſm, you will be able to judge when you have read the following Sheets, in which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to try <hi>Homer</hi> by himſelf, (as every Writer ſhould by his own Key) and by the Suffrages and Evidence of his own Advocates, and Witneſſes. For which Purpoſe, and for ſomething of Method's ſake, the firſt Subject of our Inquiry ſhall be the <hi>Machinery</hi> of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and the next, the general <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of this great Poet, and his particular Conduct in Reſpect of <hi>Characters, Incidents,</hi> and other Circumſtances. And, I perſuade myſelf, the Reſult of this Inquiry will be your agreeing with me that <hi>Homer,</hi> with the moſt fruitful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, extenſive Knowledge, and no ſmall Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has really much leſs Art, and Deſign in this Work, than he is ſuppoſed to have had; at leaſt for what appears to the contrary from the Obſervations of his Commentators.</p>

That of <hi>Homer</hi> is conducted with extraordinary Circumſtances of Solemnity, and Magnificence. But the great Queſtion is, whether we are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to take the Simple and literal Senſe of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0093400102:426"/>
the Author with regard to the Appearance, and Actions of theſe ſuperiour Beings; or whether we are to ſuppoſe a ſecret, and allegorical Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be veil'd under all this <hi>Apparatus;</hi> or, in other Words, whether we can with any Degree of Certainty extract a Syſtem of Morality, or Theology from it. This has been attempted to be done by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> and all others who have undertaken to explain, illuſtrate, or defend the Writings of this inimitable Poet; and it muſt be own'd too that this has been done in many Places in a very plauſible Manner. However I muſt be of Opinion, upon reviewing the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with itſelf, that theſe Gentlemen have puſh'd this Matter too far, and by ſtrain'd Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Refinements, found out Myſteries which were never intended; that, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall do more Juſtice, and even Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Homer</hi> by ſuppoſing <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Note at L. 422. B. V.</note>
                     <q>he follow'd Fame, and common Opinion in his Account of the Gods, though no way agreeable to Truth.</q> Upon this Suppoſition at leaſt, He will, I think appear much more uniform, and reconcileable with himſelf. I do not deny indeed that the <hi>Iliad</hi> abounds with noble, and rational Sentiments, and ſuch as are conformable to true Theology; particularly that the Neceſſity of Divine Aſſiſtance
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0093400102:427"/>
and Interpoſition for all Human Succeſſes is a Moral ſtrongly inculcated throughout the Poem. But whatever <hi>Homer</hi>'s religious Notions, as a <hi>Man,</hi> might be, or, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> expreſſes it, <q>whatever he might <hi>think</hi> of his Gods, he took them as he found them; he brought them into Action according to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in ſome Stories as they were then believ'd.</q> If you conſider his <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as a <hi>Fabulous</hi> or <hi>Poetical</hi> Character, there is leſs in it to ſhock you; but if you believe, He meant to exhibit to his Reader under this Character, "the One, ſupreme, omnipotent God" You muſt ſoon have a very mean Opinion not only of his Philoſophy, but even of his Senſe. 'Tis true, <q>He ſometimes introduces <hi>Jupiter</hi> with a Majeſty, and Superiority worthy the great Ruler of the Univerſe,</q> particularly in the Beginning of the 8th Book; but he is in general repreſented as much ſubject to Weakneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and Paſſion as the inferiour Deities. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if any Divine Attribute be plainly, and conſiſtently applied to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> it is <hi>Power;</hi> yet even this ſeems to be applied rather from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Fabulous Tradition,</hi> than by the <hi>religious Theory</hi> of the Poet himſelf. For the Story of the Rebellion of the Gods, and their Defeat by <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> refers to, cannot be underſtood to be his own Invention. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> acknowleges

                     <q>He is not even exempted from our common Appetites, and Frailties; He is made to eat, drink, and ſleep.</q> It is pleaſant enough to obſerve how careful the Commentators have been, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch Acknowledgements, to maintain the ſuppos'd Superiority of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and what ſhifts they have recourſe to to ſave his Honour upon all Occaſions. <q>

                     <q>we may obſerve the Decorum and Decency his Author conſtantly preſerves</q> in making <hi>Jupiter</hi> only <hi>Smile</hi> upon certain Occaſions, while the other Gods <hi>laugh out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I leave it to you to judge what Sort of a Salvo this muſt be, allowing any Foundation for the Diſtinction itſelf; as indeed I do not recollect there is. There ſeems at leaſt to be univerſal Jollity in Heaven in one very remarkable Paſſage, without any reſerve for the Gravity of this Deity; I mean in the firſt Book, where <hi>Vulcan</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">See at L. 771. of the 1ſt B.</note> deſigns

to move laughter by taking upon him the Office of <hi>Hebe</hi> and <hi>Ganymede,</hi> with his aukward limp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carriage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Vulcan with aukward grace his Office plies,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> with all his Pomp and Preeminence, is hardly above a Level with the ſubordinate Deities in point of corporal Weakneſs and Infirmity; nor will you find him to rank much higher if you take a View of his Conduct, and Actions in general throughout the Poem. You will obſerve him upon numberleſs Occaſions under the Influence of Paſſions utterly unſuitable to the Purity, as well as Dignity of the Supreme Being. The Fiction of his <q>being deceiv'd and laid aſleep,</q> and of his amorous correſpondence with <hi>Juno,</hi> has, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, as great <q>an Air of Impiety, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</q> as any Fable in all Antiquity. <q>I <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 179. of the 14th B.</note>muſt needs, upon the whole, (ſays that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Remarker) as far as I can judge, give up the Morality of this Fable; but what Colour of Excuſe for it <hi>Homer</hi> might have from antient Tradition, or what myſtical, or allegorical Senſe might atone for the appearing Impiety, is hard to be aſcertain'd at this diſtant Period of Time.</q> Here is a Condemnation, and a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0093400102:431"/>
Palliation of a Fault in one Breath. Indeed Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> thro' his unabated Zeal for the Honour of his Original, is <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Note laſt referred to.</note>willing afterwards to ſuppoſe the "preſent Paſſage to be grounded on Religion," and to be nothing more than the <q>Repreſentation of a religious Solemnity; or elſe to be purely allegorical, and as ſuch implying only</q> the Congreſs of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> the Mingling of the <hi>Aether</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> (which are generally ſaid to be ſignified by theſe two Deities.) But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if you conſult the Place, you will think the firſt Expedient a forc'd one, and the ſecond (allowing the <hi>Phyſical</hi> Signification of theſe two Deities) inſufficient for the intended Vindication. For what Connection is there in the Mingling of the <hi>Aether</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> with the Matter in Hand? or how does it in the leaſt effect the Circumſtances of the Battle between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Trojans.</hi> To ſay nothing of <hi>Venus,</hi> who certainly is no <hi>Phyſical</hi> Deity, and yet bears a part in this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.—The literal, and obvious Senſe of <hi>Homer</hi> with all its Groſſneſs ſeems to be the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent one which this Paſſage can fairly be made to carry.</p>
                  <p>It is worth while to take Notice of the Shifts the Commentators have recourſe to, when they are preſt with Difficulties of this Nature. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Circumſtances of the Extremity, the

                     <q>the <note n="†" place="bottom">See Note at L. 439. of the 8th B.</note>Deities ſometimes mean no more than Beings that preſided over the Paſſions and Faculties of the Mind, and in conſequence of all this <hi>Jupiter</hi> is either the <hi>Aether,</hi> or the <hi>Father of Gods and Men, Juno</hi> is the Goddeſs of <hi>Honour</hi> or the <hi>Air,</hi> and <q>

Nay in Places where the Meaning of the Author is irreconcileable with allegorical Conſtruction, it is ſuppoſed to <note n="‡" place="bottom">See Note at 566.

A hidden and myſterious Senſe there plainly <hi>is,</hi> or certainly <hi>muſt</hi> be; and we muſt at all Events, and tho' apparent Abſurdities will be ſaved by it, reject a <hi>literal</hi> Interpertation of <hi>Homer</hi> where
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0093400102:433"/>
the Gods are concerned. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf owns that ſometimes <hi>Homer</hi>'s <note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſſay on Homer, P. 56, 57.</note>Machine's play a little too Groſſly, and that the Fable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently oppreſſes the Moral, which it may be loſt Labour to ſearch for in every minute Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, if indeed it was intended to be there.</q> In Truth, I am apt to think we ſhould read this Poet with more Pleaſure, and equal Profit, if we perplexed ourſelves leſs to find out Myſteries in him; and by the way, it is ſcarce worth our Pains to inveſtigate hidden Meanings, when the plain and literal Moral of the Poem is as obvious upon a thouſand Occaſions as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and excellent. If you conſider the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> in a <hi>Poetical,</hi> rather than a <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Light, and ſuppoſe his Gods to be real Characters acting under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Human Paſſions, as antient Fables re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them, and taking their Meaſures from Motives of perſonal Affection, Reſentment, &amp;c. &amp;c. I believe you will have a ſurer Inlet into the Meaning of this famous Author, and be able to examine him by Rules not liable to Difficulties, which are only to be removed by forced, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Solutions.—But as there is a Novelty in this Opinion, You will expect I ſhould ſtrengthen and confirm it by more Reaſons, and Obſervations.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>THE <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 422. B. v.</note>famous Cenſure of <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> (mentioned by Mr. <hi>Pope)</hi> that <hi>Homer makes God's of his Heroes, and Mortals of his Gods,</hi>
                     </q> will appear to be groundleſs, if you regulate your Ideas of this Author by the Notions I have conceived of him. For pure <hi>Poetical</hi> Fictions, whether invented or adopted by <hi>Homer,</hi> come not properly under the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of a <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Inquiry. Accordingly we ſhall not only have a ready Excuſe for this great Poet when he introduces his Deities <q>feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fighting, wounded by Men, and ſhedding a Sort of Blood;</q> but alſo when they are repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as committing Actions unworthy of themſelves, and of the reſpective Characters they are ſuppoſed by the common Opinion of Commentators to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> allows that <q>if <note n="†" place="bottom">See Note at L. 96. B. iv.</note>the <hi>Trojans</hi> had no Right to break the Treaty,</q> made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the <hi>Grecians</hi> upon the Duel of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi> 
                     <q>the Machine where <hi>Juno</hi> is made to propoſe Perjury, <hi>Jupiter</hi> to allow it, and <hi>Minerva</hi> to be commiſſioned to haſten the Execution of it, would be <hi>one</hi> of the hardeſt to be reconciled to Reaſon in the whole Poem.</q> Whether therefore the <hi>Trojans</hi> had a Right to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0093400102:435"/>
break the Treaty is a Queſtion, it will be very Material, and, I think, eaſy to determine. Now that "the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 18. B. iv.</note>Conditions of the Treaty were valid" notwithſtanding the ſnatching away of <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Venus</hi> in a Cloud, "that is to ſay, that" the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy was to be decided <hi>(either)</hi> by the <hi>Victory,</hi> or by the <hi>Death</hi> of one of the Combatants, is, I apprehend, apparent from many Conſiderations. It is certain, <q>in the firſt propoſal of the Challenge <hi>Paris</hi> mentions only the Victory, <hi>And who his Rival ſhall in Arms Subdue;</hi>
                     </q> nor does <hi>Hector,</hi> who carries it, ſay any more.</p>
                  <p>However (continues the Note) <hi>Menelaus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it of the Death by what he replies:
<q>
                        <l>Fall he that muſt beneath his Rivals Arms,</l>
                        <l>And live the reſt—</l>
                     </q>
And in the ſolemn Oath too <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſpecifies the latter, <hi>"If by Paris ſlain"</hi>—and <q>
                        <hi>If by my Brother's Arms the</hi> TROJAN <hi>bleed.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Priam</hi> alſo underſtands it of both, ſaying, at his leaving the Field,
<q>
                        <l>Whoſe Arms ſhall conquer, and whoſe Prince ſhall fall,</l>
                        <l>Heav'n only knows—</l>
                     </q>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> himſelf confeſſes he has loſt the Victory in his Speech to <hi>Helen,</hi> which he would hardly have done had the whole depended upon that alone; and laſtly <hi>Menelaus</hi> (after the Conqueſt is clearly
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0093400102:436"/>
his by the Flight of <hi>Paris)</hi> is ſtill ſearching round the Field to kill him, as if all were of no Effect without the Death of his Adverſary.—It appears from hence (ſays Mr. <hi>Pope)</hi> 
                     <q>that the <hi>Trojans</hi> had no ill pretence to break the Treaty, ſo that <hi>Homer</hi> ought not to have been directly accuſed of making <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Author of Perjury in what follows, which is one of the chief of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But was it not extremely natural for <hi>Menelaus, Agamemnon,</hi> and <hi>Priam</hi> to <hi>mention</hi> the <hi>Death</hi> of one of the Combatants as the Deciſion of the Controverſy, tho' the Terms at the Challenge <hi>ſpecified Victory</hi> only, in as much as the <hi>Death</hi> of one ſeem'd to be the unavoidable Conſequence of the Duel, and the Deliverance of <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Venus</hi> was a Circumſtance that could not poſſibly be foreſeen? For <hi>Paris,</hi> he could not be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to deny the Loſs of the Victory, whatever Shifts he might be drove to evade the Articles of the Combat—indeed he ſeems to hint at the Expedient of a ſecond Engagement.—
<q>
                        <l>This Day the Foe prevail'd by <hi>Pallas'</hi> pow'r;</l>
                        <l>We yet may vanquiſh in a happier Hour.—</l>
                     </q>
And laſtly, for <hi>Menelaus,</hi> he might very naturally "ſearch round the Field to kill his Adverſary" not for the effectual Determination of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, but for the Gratification of his <hi>perſonal</hi> Reſentment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0093400102:437"/>
Be this as it will; whatever private Perſons might think of this Affair, it is plain the <hi>Greeks</hi> looked upon the War as ended by this great Event, and accordingly <hi>Agamemnon</hi> calls upon the <hi>Trojans</hi> to fulfill the Conditions of the Treaty.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Ye <hi>Trojans, Dardans,</hi> all our gen'rous Foes!</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>But, in a Word, to put the Matter out of all Doubt, the very Terms at the Commiſſion given to <hi>Minerva,</hi> ſuppoſe the Conditions of the Treaty to be binding upon the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
                  </p>

However, to let this Deity have the Credit of it; I would only aſk whether, ſuppoſing he had been introduced by <hi>Homer</hi> on the Part of <hi>Troy,</hi> the Sagacity of <hi>Euſtathius</hi> would not have aſſigned as ſpecious a Reaſon for it as the preſent.

                  <p>IT bears hard, I preſume, upon the Notion of an allegorical Meaning's being couched under the Appearances and Actions of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Deities, that we are ſo often at a Loſs for any Reaſon to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for them, or cannot give one with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, and Propriety.

                  <p>It belongs to the Advocates of the common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſolve all theſe Difficulties, and many more that might be added to them.—In the mean Time I would have you turn your Eyes to a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or two, where the <hi>Allegory</hi> is ſuppoſed to be ſelf-evident, and tell me whether the Matter be ſo undeniably clear as the Illuſtrations of the Commentators pretend to make it. The Deſcent of <hi>Minerva</hi> in the firſt Book to prevent <hi>Achilles'</hi> attempting the Life of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is deſcanted upon at large as a Paſſage of this Nature. <q>The <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 261.

                        <hi>Allegory</hi> here (ſays Mr. <hi>Pope)</hi> may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by every Reader to be unforced: The <hi>Prudence</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> checks him in the raſheſt Moment of his Anger, it works upon him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen to others, but does not entirely prevail upon him to deſiſt till he remembers his own Importance, and depends upon it, that there will be a Neceſſity of their courting him at any Expence into their Alliance again. Having
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0093400102:453"/>
perſuaded himſelf by ſuch Reflections, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears to attack his General, but thinking that he ſacrifices enough to Prudence by this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, lets the Thought of it vaniſh from him; and no ſooner is Wiſdom gone, but he falls into more violent Reproaches for the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his Paſſion. All this is a moſt beautiful Paſſage, whoſe Moral is evident, and generally agreed on by the Commentators.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now had <hi>Minerva</hi> only been the Actreſs in this Affair, all this had been a very natural <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but <hi>Homer</hi> gives us to underſtand that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> was <note n="*" place="bottom">See L. 262.</note>diſpatched by <hi>Juno</hi> (the Goddeſs of <hi>Honour)</hi> on this Errand. If therefore <hi>Juno</hi> be not an utterly inſignificant Perſonage in this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, the <hi>Honour</hi> as well as the <hi>Prudence</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to ſuggeſt his preſent Conduct to him. But as a <hi>Soldier,</hi> and a <hi>paſſionate</hi> one too, no doubt he muſt think himſelf obliged in Point of <hi>Honour</hi> to take <hi>immediate</hi> Satisfaction for the Affront which had been put upon him; and ſo his <hi>Honour</hi> ſuggeſts, what his <hi>Prudence</hi> forbids. As <hi>allegorical</hi> Perſons therefore I can't think but <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> appear together with <hi>ſome Force</hi> in this <hi>Machine.</hi> Nor, by the way, does it ſeem agreeable to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Goddeſs of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to ſuffer <hi>Achilles</hi> to break out into ſuch ſcurrilous and virulent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0093400102:454"/>
as he makes Uſe of in his next Speech to <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> he does this when <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is gone, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays, but ſtill it was by her <hi>Permiſſion,</hi> one might ſay <hi>Direction</hi> indeed.

                     </q>
The Original is ſtronger, and contains a more unlimited Commiſſion; and in conſequence of it <hi>Achilles</hi> rates his General with a Vengeance;

Even this Paſſage then you ſee is not clear of Difficulties, and as much as may be ſaid in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the allegorical Interpretation, the literal Senſe is at leaſt eaſy, and liable to no Exception.</p>
                  <p>I will only deſire you to turn once more to the fifth Book, of which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at the End of B. v.</note>
                     <q>the Allegory lies ſo open, is carried on with ſuch Cloſeneſs, and wound up with ſo much Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Strength, that it is a Wonder how it could enter into the Imagination of any Critic, that <hi>theſe</hi> Actions of <hi>Diomed</hi> were only a daring and extravagant Fiction in <hi>Homer,</hi> as if he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the <hi>marvellous</hi> at any Rate. The great Moral of it is, that a brave Man ſhould not contend againſt Heaven, but reſiſt only <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> Incontinence and ungoverned Fury.</q>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0093400102:455"/>
—<q>Nothing is more obſervable than the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Care <hi>Homer</hi> has taken to ſhew he deſigned this Moral.</q>—<q>
                        <hi>Minerva,</hi> at the Beginning of the Battle, is made to give this Precept to <hi>Diomed: Fight not againſt the Gods, but give Way to them, and reſiſt only</hi> VENUS. The Hero himſelf, as ſoon as he has performed her Dictates in driving away <hi>Venus,</hi> cries out not as to the <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> but as to the Paſſion, <hi>Thou haſt no Buſineſs with Warriors, is it not enough that thou deceiveſt weak Women?</hi> Even the Mother of <hi>Venus,</hi> while ſhe comforts her Daughter, bears Teſtimony to the Moral: <hi>That Man</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>is not long liv'd who contends with the Gods.</hi> And when <hi>Diomed,</hi> tranſported by his Nature, proceeds but a Step too far, <hi>Apollo</hi> diſcovers himſelf in the moſt ſolemn Manner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares this Truth in his own Voice, as it were by direct Revelation: <hi>Mortal, forbear, conſider and know the vaſt Difference there is between the Gods and thee,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the firſt Place I am afraid <hi>Homer</hi> will not appear to have been ſo <hi>particularly</hi> careful to ſhew he deſigned this Moral, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> would make us believe. For though <hi>Diomed</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <q>in the Beginning of the Battle to give Way to the Gods, and reſiſt only <hi>Venus,</hi> he is afterwards empowered to attack <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>any</hi> Deity that ſhould come in his Way;</q>

                        <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0093400102:456"/>

                  <p>I can't help tranſcribing to you Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Note upon this Place, who begins now to be of the ſame Sentiment. <q>A quick Change of Mind from the greateſt <hi>Impiety</hi> to as great Superſtition is frequently obſervable in Men, who having been guilty of the greateſt Crimes without any Remorſe, on the ſudden are filled with Doubts and Scruples about the moſt lawful or indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Actions. This ſeems the preſent Caſe of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0093400102:458"/>
                        <hi>Diomed,</hi> who having knowingly wounded and inſulted the Deities, is now afraid to engage the firſt Man he meets, leſt perhaps a God might be concealed in that Shape.</q> I confeſs this <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Diomed,</hi> which violently ſhakes the Allegory in Queſtion, appears to me inconſiſtent likewiſe with the Tenor of this Hero's Character; nor can I think Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> brings him off when he acquaints us in the following Note, that <q>what <hi>Diomed</hi> here ſays is the Effect of Remorſe, as if he had exceeded the Commiſſion of <hi>Pallas</hi> in encountring with the Gods, and dreaded the Conſequences of proceeding too far. At leaſt he had no ſuch Commiſſion now, and beſides, was no longer capable of diſtinguiſhing them from Men (a Faculty ſhe had given him in the foregoing Book). He there mentions this Story of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> as an Example that ſufficed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him from ſo raſh an Undertaking.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the firſt Place it by no Means appears that this Commiſſion was expired, or that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ceas'd; at leaſt the contrary may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Tranſlation of this Speech. <hi>Diomed</hi> ſays but two Lines above
<q>
                        <l>Unhappy they, and born of luckleſs Sires,</l>
                        <l>Who tempt our Fury when <hi>Minerva</hi> fires! <bibl>l. 157.</bibl>
                        </l>
                     </q>
After all, why ſhould he torment himſelf with Reflections on what he had done only by Virtue of that <hi>Commiſſion</hi> before, which he was far from
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0093400102:459"/>
exceeding except in his Attempt upon <hi>Apollo,</hi> from whom however upon the firſt Reproof he retired? Or, why ſhould the Example of <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> who acted not by divine Impulſe, terrify one who confeſſedly did? In this Light what will become of the <hi>allegorical</hi> Characters of <hi>Minerva, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> or how comes a Hero to be troubled in Conſcience becauſe he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting <hi>Incontinence,</hi> and <hi>ungoverned Fury?</hi> Thus you find this Allegory, which we were told lies ſo open, is clogged likewiſe with its Difficulties; from which indeed neither is the literal Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſſage clear; for it ſeems unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that a Man ſhould ſuffer from the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one God for what he committed by the Direction, and Command of another; though this is no unuſual Thing in <hi>Pagan</hi> Story.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, to have done with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery</hi> of this great Poet, I leave it to you to judge, whether there is not abundant Ground to conclude, that the Interpreters have <hi>frequently</hi> taken Pains to aſcertain a Meaning in him which never came into his Head; that if he had a latent and ſymbolical Meaning, at leaſt they have not hit upon it, and that there is more Ingenuity than Solidity, as we have hinted, in many of their Interpretations. In a Word, I cannot ſee how any thing like a regular and conſiſtent Syſtem either of Theology, or of Morality, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0093400102:460"/>
from <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Machinery</hi>—if he drops a Sentiment or an Expreſſion occaſionally, as he often does, with a View one would think to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Reader of the Rectitude of his <hi>private</hi> Notions with Regard to the Deity, his <hi>Jupiter</hi> appears to have been a <hi>fabulous</hi> and <hi>traditional</hi> Character, and is drawn with Imperfections, and Infirmities incompatible with the natural Ideas of a ſupreme Being. As to the inferior Deities it ſeems impoſſible to form a preciſe Idea of their hidden Significancy, or <hi>allegorical</hi> Importance, from the Actions which we have ſeen aſcribed to them: So that <hi>Homer</hi> had really much <hi>leſs Deſign</hi> in the Plan of his Poem than is ſuppoſed (on which Suppoſition he may however be plainly made more uniform, and of a Piece) or he had much <hi>more</hi> than has ever yet been, or we may ſuppoſe <hi>now</hi> ever will be, comprehended. In my next I will conſider in another Point of View the noble Production of this excellent Poet.</p>

                  <p>IT may be proper to remind you in this Place that I neither have ſaid, nor ſhall ſay any thing of <hi>Homer</hi> with an Intent to <hi>leſſen</hi> your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, but to <hi>ſet it right;</hi> for it is one Thing to undervalue a Poet, and another to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the Reader. If <hi>Homer</hi> be juſtly eſteemed one of the <hi>greateſt</hi> Geniuſes the World has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0093400102:461"/>
(perhaps the greateſt) it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that he is one of the <hi>firſt</hi> too; and it is abſurd to look for that Perfection in the <hi>Original,</hi> which we have a Right to expect in the <hi>Copy.</hi> It is the Characteriſtic of <hi>Invention</hi> to be <hi>great,</hi> of <hi>Imitation,</hi> to be <hi>exact;</hi> and if <hi>Virgil</hi> could not have improved the Model of the <hi>Epopee</hi> left him by <hi>Homer,</hi> he ſhould not have taken a Pen in his Hand. The <hi>Intervention</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> with all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects will always be the Object of our <hi>Admiration;</hi> the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> with all his Proprieties will only deſerve our <hi>Praiſe.</hi>—I own it has often amazed me to find the Commentators ſo confident to deny, or ſolicitous to extenuate <hi>Homer</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which really do no Diſcredit to him, and which ought to be imputed to that <hi>Simplicity</hi> with which every <hi>original</hi> Production of the human Mind is naturally imagined. It is, I apprehend, for want of conſidering this great Author in this Light, that the Expoſitors often run into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Extreme, and are induſtrious to diſcover Beauties and Excellencies which were merely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, and ought rather to be put to the Account of the Editor's Affection or Sagacity, than to that of the Art, or Deſign of the Author.—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Notion I have already ſubmitted to your Conſideration my Sentiments on <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Machines;</hi> and agreeably to my Propoſal I ſhall next give you my Thoughts upon the Plan or Oeconomy of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0093400102:462"/>
the <hi>Iliad</hi> in general, and then proceed to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the Poet's Conduct in ſome particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Now, I think, it may be noted as a Defect in the general Oeconomy of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> which is to be aſcribed to the Cauſe juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that the Poet has not taken ſufficient Care to intereſt his Readers on the Side of his Countrymen, notwithſtanding the apparent Juſtice of their Cauſe. This is clear to me from ſeveral Conſiderations, as firſt from the Countenance and Protection given to the <hi>Trojans</hi> in general by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> in Preference to the <hi>Greeks.</hi>—I am very ſenſible the Commentators repreſent this Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Conſequence <hi>only</hi> of that God's Promiſe to <hi>Thetis,</hi> to humble the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and do Honour to <hi>Achilles.</hi>—But is it not as plain too, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> throughout the Poem is <hi>perſonally</hi> well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to <hi>Troy</hi> in general, and that for very good Reaſons? It appears from <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Thetis,</hi> that he had declared himſelf in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Trojans</hi> long before ſhe made this Application to him,</p>

                     <l>The Gods Complaints, and <hi>Juno</hi>'s fierce Alarms,</l>
                     <l>While I, too partial, aid the <hi>Trojan</hi> Arms?</l>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has a Note from <hi>Dacier,</hi> which corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates what I have remarked upon this Head. <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 9. B. iv.</note> 
                        <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Reproaching theſe two Goddeſſes <hi>(Juno</hi> and <hi>Pallas)</hi> with neglecting to aſſiſt <hi>Menelaus</hi> (in the Duel) proceeds from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he bore to <hi>Troy;</hi> ſince if <hi>Menelaus</hi> had gained by their Help a complete Victory, <hi>(which it has been obſerved, was a ſufficient one)</hi> the Siege had been raiſed, and the City delivered. On the contrary, <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> might ſuffer <hi>Paris</hi> to eſcape, as the Method to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the War, to the total Deſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> and accordingly a few Lines after we find them
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0093400102:464"/>
complotting together, and contriving a new Scene of Miſeries to the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
                     </q> The latter Part of this Note confirms what has been before obſerved, that theſe Goddeſſes ſeem to have been actuated by a Spirit of the moſt inveterate Malice, and Animoſity againſt a whole Race <q>
                        <hi>Unius ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxam.</hi>
                     </q> The Reſtitution of <hi>Helen,</hi> &amp;c. was not the grand Object of their Counſels.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if you take them in the Groſs, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will find the Deities on the Side of <hi>Troy</hi> (tho' <hi>Mars</hi> is in the Number) to be more gentle, and mercifully inclined, than thoſe that are the Aſſiſtants of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, I can't help being of Opinion that upon the whole, the Poet gives us a much more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Idea of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> than he does of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> if we regard the <hi>Manners,</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of the Heroes concerned on both Sides. Let us take a ſhort Vew of the principal Perſonages that fight in the Cauſe of <hi>Troy. Hector,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays, <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 53. B. iii.</note> if he is not the chief Hero in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> is at leaſt the moſt amiable, and is for ſeveral Reaſons a favourite Character with every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</q>—<q>He ſtands in contraſt to <hi>Achilles,</hi> an accompliſhed Character of Valour, unruffled by Rage, and Anger, and uniting his People by his Prudence, and Example.</q> 
                     <q>It is the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0093400102:465"/>
Love of his Country, which appears his principal Paſſion, and the Motive of all his Actions. He has no other Blemiſh than that he fights in an unjuſt Cauſe, which <hi>Homer</hi> has yet been careful to tell us he would not do, if his Opinion were followed.</q> 
                     <q>We may add, that <hi>Homer,</hi> having ſo many <hi>Greeks</hi> to celebrate, makes them ſhine it their Turns, &amp;c. whereas <hi>Hector</hi> appears in every Battle the Life and Soul of his Party, and the conſtant Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark againſt every Enemy; he ſtands againſt <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Magnanimity, <hi>Diomed</hi>'s Bravery, <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Strength, and <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Fury.</q>
                  </p>

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 212. B. v.</note> The Piety, and Valour of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> tho' not drawn at ſo full a Length, are marked no leſs in <hi>(Homer)</hi> the Original, than in <hi>(Virgil)</hi> the Copy. It is the Manner of <hi>Homer</hi> to expreſs very ſtrongly the Character of each of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the firſt Speech he is made to utter in the Poem. In this of <hi>Aeneas</hi> there is a great Air of <hi>Piety</hi> in thoſe Strokes, <hi>Is he ſome God who puniſhes</hi> TROY <hi>for having neglected his Sacrifices?</hi> and then in that Sentence, <hi>the Anger of Heaven is Terrible.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>In a Word, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> tells us in another Place. <q>

                  <p>The Character of <hi>Sarpedon,</hi> ſays the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, is the <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 512. B. xvi.</note> moſt faultleſs, and amiable in the whole <hi>Iliad.</hi> This Hero is by Birth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to all the Chiefs of either Side, being the only Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> engaged in this War. His Qualities are no way unworthy his Deſcent, ſince he every where appears equal in Valour, Prudence, and Eloquence to the moſt admired Heroes: Nor are theſe Excellencies blemiſhed with any of thoſe Defects with which the moſt diſtinguiſhed Characters of the Poem are ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that the niceſt Criticks cannot find any Thing to offend their Delicacy, but muſt be obliged to own the Manners of this Hero per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. His Valour is neither raſh, nor boiſterous, his Prudence neither timorous, nor tricking; and his Eloquence, neither talkative, nor boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He never reproaches the Living, nor inſults the Dead; but appears uniform thro' his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the War, acting with the ſame generous Sentiments that engaged him in it; having no intereſt in the Quarrel, but to ſuccour his Allies in diſtreſs. This noble Life is ended with a Death as glorious; for in his laſt Moments he has no other Concern, but for the Honour of his
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0093400102:467"/>
Friends, and the Event of the Day.</q>—<q>His is the only Death in the <hi>Iliad</hi> attended with Prodigies; even his Funeral is performed by divine Aſſiſtance, he being the only Hero whoſe Body is carried back to be interred in his native Country, &amp;c.</q>—<q>Theſe peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Honours ſeem appropriated by our Author to him alone, as the Reward of a Merit ſuperiour to all his other leſs perfect Heroes.</q> Theſe are the moſt illuſtrious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters on the Side of <hi>Troy;</hi> tho' the inferiour ones, if not ſo ſtriking, are at leaſt generally ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inoffenſive; as thoſe of <hi>Deiphobus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus, Polydamas,</hi> and <hi>Glaucus.</hi> Even that of <hi>Paris</hi> is upon the whole far from being odious, or diſguſting. I believe, among other Things the Value every Reader has for theſe Characters, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly his Love and Eſteem of <hi>Hector,</hi> inclines his Wiſhes to the Side of <hi>Troy.</hi> Indeed Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has (perhaps undeſignedly) given us in the above Accounts of <hi>Sarpedon,</hi> a kind of Contraſt to the Manners, and Characters of many of the Leaders in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army. For the Valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and of <hi>Diomed</hi> is undoubtedly <hi>raſh,</hi> and <hi>boiſterous;</hi> the Prudence of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is ſometimes <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 121. B. viii.</note>
                     <hi>timorous;</hi> and the Eloquence of <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> and <hi>Nector</hi> is <hi>talkative</hi> and <hi>boaſting.</hi> But what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0093400102:468"/>
us more than any Thing elſe againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is that Cruelty, and Inhumanity which is ſo remarkable in their Chiefs of the firſt Note, and Figure. Granting <hi>Achilles</hi> in all he does to act in Character, and ſuitably to his <q>ferocious and vindictive Spirit</q> the very Nature of the Character itſelf is offenſive, and the Propriety and Coherence with which it is preſerved, diſtaſteful. <q>His Inhumanity in dragging the dead Body of <hi>Hector</hi> has been ſeverely (and I think indeed not without ſome Juſtice, ſays Mr. <hi>Pope)</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſeveral, both Antients, and Moderns.</q> Indeed the Queſtion is whether the whole Picture of <hi>Achilles</hi> as drawn by <hi>Homer,</hi> has not ſtronger, and more violent Features in it than Neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired? The Subject of the Poem is the Anger of this Hero, and the ill Conſequences of it to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but this brutal Treatment of the Body of a generous Enemy, is neither the natural Effect of <hi>that</hi> Anger, nor a Soldier-like Revenge for the Death of his Friend <hi>Patroclus.</hi>—'Tis true, the Commentators have obſerved that, <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 137. B. xvii.</note> 
                        <hi>Homer</hi> takes Care before Hand, to leſſen in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Mind the Horrour he may conceive from the Cruelty which <hi>Achilles</hi> will exerciſe upon the Body of <hi>Hector,</hi> by ſhewing this Cruelty as the Puniſhment only of that which <hi>Hector</hi>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0093400102:469"/>
exerciſes upon the Body of <hi>Patroclus;</hi> he drags him; he <hi>deſigns</hi> to cut off his Head, and to leave his Body upon the Ramparts, expoſed to Dogs, and Birds of Prey.</q> The Obſervation is founded on Fact; but however as this Piece of <hi>intended</hi> Cruelty is inconſiſtent with <hi>Hector</hi>'s gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Character, he ſhould not have been repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as capable of it, and as it was only <hi>intended,</hi> it makes not ſo horrible an Impreſſion upon us as the <hi>actual</hi> Inhumanity of the Poet's favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Hero. I have often thought by the way, that the Barbarity of <hi>Achilles</hi> towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the unfortunate, and univerſally beloved <hi>Hector,</hi> occaſioned the Miſrepreſentation of the very Fact of his Death by the well-known Story, (which <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> adheres to in his <hi>Troilus and Creſſida)</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s ungenerouſly attacking him unarmed, and cutting him to Pieces.—So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous was the exaſperated Author to depreciate the Character of this Hero, and exalt that of his Adverſary. But to return; be the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Achilles</hi> as "poetically perfect" as poſſible, and the Morality to be drawn from it as obvious as you pleaſe, he ſeems to have the leaſt Merit of any of the principal Perſonages in the Poem, and we can ſcarce help being ſorry to ſee ſo many deteſtable Qualities on the right Side of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In a Word "the Virtues of Humanity" which he <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 798. B. xxiv.</note>diſcovers in the 24th Book, when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0093400102:470"/>
he reſtores the Body of <hi>Hector</hi> to <hi>Priam,</hi> and "the amiable Qualities" which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> tells us <q>ſoften the terrible Ideas we have conceived of him</q> are exerciſed too late to wipe off the Stain of his paſt unheroical, and unmanly Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; eſpecially when we conſider that this Act of Humanity was the Effect of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s expreſs Command, delivered by his Mother <hi>Thetis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, though we cannot but take Notice of a great deal of Inſolence and Cruelty on both Sides, and are ſhocked, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> confeſſes he is, at the many Inſtances of Inhumanity that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur throughout the Poem, <q>which however are not to be <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 57. B. vi.</note>imputed to the Poet, who followed Nature as it was in his Days, but to be aſcribed to the uncivilized Manners of thoſe Times, when Mankind was not united by the Bonds of a rational Society,</q> yet I believe we ſhall find much more Blame due to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> than to the <hi>Trojans</hi> upon this Score. Not to inſiſt upon thoſe other glaring Proofs of a bloody, and unmerciful Diſpoſition, which <hi>Achilles</hi> gives in the killing <hi>Lycaon</hi>

                        <hi>Homer</hi> has drawn gives us Cauſe to think his Genius was no leſs capable of touching the Heart with Tenderneſs, than of firing it with Glory.</q> 
                     <q>This Epiſode, (ſays that excellent Perſon,) tends very much to raiſe the Character of <hi>Hector,</hi> and endear him to every Reader,</q> and indeed we cannot admire this Hero more in the Field, than we love him at Home.

and the due Execution of it were without Doubt conſiſtent, it is plain that for Want of it you will meet with much Incongruity, not to ſay Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, in many Places.

                  <p>But it is Time to come to the other Objection, which, as I am not ſingular in it, I will give you in the Words of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Note prefixed to the 23d Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and endeavour to confirm it by a Remark or two upon what that Expoſitor has offered by way of Vindication of his Author. <q>This, and the following Book, which contain the Deſcription of the Funeral of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and other Matters relating to <hi>Hector,</hi> are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſuper-added to the grand Cataſtrophe of the Poem; for the Story is compleatly finiſhed with the Death of that Hero in the 22d Book. Many judicious Criticks have been of Opinion, that <hi>Homer</hi> is blameable for protracting it. <hi>Virgil</hi> cloſes the whole Scene of Action with the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and leaves the reſt to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by the Mind of the Reader: He does not draw the Picture at full Length, but delineates it ſo far, that we cannot fail of imagining the whole Draught. There is however one Thing to be ſaid in Favour of <hi>Homer,</hi> which may perhaps juſtify him in his Method that what he
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0093400102:479"/>
undertook to paint was the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Achilles;</hi> and as that Anger does not die with <hi>Hector,</hi> but perſecutes his very Remains, ſo the Poet ſtill keeps up to his Subject; nay, it ſeems to require that he ſhould carry down the Relation of that Reſentment, which is the Foundation of his Poem, till it is fully ſatisfied: And as this ſurvives <hi>Hector,</hi> and gives the Poet an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſtill ſhewing many ſad Effects of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Anger, the two following Books may be thought not to be Excreſcencies, but eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Poem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Virgil</hi> had been inexcuſable had he trod in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Footſteps; for it is evident that the Fall of <hi>Turnus,</hi> by giving <hi>Aeneas</hi> a full Power over <hi>Italy,</hi> anſwers the whole Deſign and Intention of the Poem; had he gone farther he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot his Mark; and though <hi>Homer</hi> proceeds after <hi>Hector</hi>'s Death, yet the Subject is ſtill the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
                     </q> Now, I apprehend, the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which is the <q>Foundation of the Poem,</q> is entirely diſtinct from that <hi>Anger,</hi> or rather <hi>Revenge</hi> with which he <q>perſecutes the very Remains of <hi>Hector,</hi>
                     </q> and that the whole declared "Deſign and Intention" of the Poet was "to paint the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Achilles"</hi> as the Source of all the Misfortunes the <hi>Grecians</hi> underwent; which were ended by the Reconciliation of that Chief and <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> We <hi>then</hi> ſee as plainly the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0093400102:480"/>
good Effects of Union to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as we <hi>did</hi> the fatal Conſequences of Diſcord through the moſt conſiderable Part of the Poem; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Death of <hi>Hector,</hi> and the Triumph of the <hi>Grecians</hi> thereupon was the proper, and natural Cataſtrophe of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> The <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> conſidered as the Paſſion he was <hi>addicted</hi> to, might have been protracted through many Books more.—In ſhort, the Super-addition of theſe Books, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter, inſtead of being juſtifiable by the Reaſons above alledged, does even come within the Reach of a former Objection: For the Care taken of <hi>Hector</hi>'s Body by two <note n="*" place="bottom">See B. xxiii.

                     <hi>HOMER</hi> is with much Juſtice to be admired in the main for the agreeable Variety of his Characters, and for the remarkable Spirit, and Uniformity with which each of them is ſuſtained. If he is ſometimes faulty upon this Article it is to be aſcribed to mere human Infirmity perhaps, or in ſome Caſes to that Simplicity which, as has been ſaid, diſtinguiſhes the <hi>Inventors</hi> of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from the <hi>Improvers</hi> of them. To one of theſe it is probably owing that we ſee ſuch a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Character as that of <hi>Therſites</hi> in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or ſo contemptible a one as that of <hi>Nireus:</hi> The latter, the moſt <hi>beautiful,</hi> the former, the moſt <hi>deformed Perſon</hi> of the Poem.

The Truth is, neither of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages are of any Service towards the Illuſtration of a <hi>principal</hi> Character.

I make no doubt, of Opinion, that <q>upon the whole, his Character is by no Means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, tho' not of the moſt ſhining Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He is called indeed in the 17th <hi>Iliad.</hi>

                  <p>I will only point out to what I think rather an Overſight than not in <hi>Homer,</hi> with regard to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Character, and then quit the preſent Article of Inquiry; I mean the Character of <hi>Ajax,</hi> whom, not abſolutely, but comparatively ſpeaking, I can't look upon as a proper Perſon to be diſpatched upon the Embaſſy to <hi>Achilles</hi> in the 9th Book. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> however informs us <q>that the Choice of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0093400102:485"/>
three <note n="†" place="bottom">See Note at L. 222. B. ix.</note>Perſons <hi>(Phoenix, Ajax,</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes)</hi> is made with a great deal of Judgment. <hi>Achilles</hi> could not but reverence the venerable <hi>Phoenix,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ajax,</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> had been diſgraced in the firſt Book (L. 187) as well as he, and were therefore proper Perſons to perſuade him to forgive, as they had forgiven; beſides it was the greateſt Honour that could be done to <hi>Achilles,</hi> to ſend the <hi>moſt</hi> worthy Perſonages in the Army to him. <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> was inferiour to none in Eloquence, <hi>but</hi> to <hi>Neſtor. Ajax</hi> was ſecond to none in Valour but to <hi>Achilles. Ajax</hi> might have an influence over him as a Relation, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet as ingenious as all this may be, 'tis certain, that of all the Heroes, <hi>Ajax</hi> was the worſt <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and ſo <hi>far</hi> at leaſt he was was unqualified for the Charge in Queſtion.—He is by no means a favourite Character with the Poet himſelf; if he had he would have <q>given him a Prize pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in ſome of the Games in the 23d Book;</q> one Reaſon why he did not, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſuppoſes might be, becauſe he had a Mind to ſhew that <q>Strength without Conduct, is uſually unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,</q> which gives us no favourable Idea of this Hero, and much leſs authorizes us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him one of the <q>moſt worthy Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in the Army;</q> that he was ſecond to none
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0093400102:486"/>
in <hi>Strength</hi> but to <hi>Achilles,</hi> may be granted; but in <hi>Valour</hi> he has no doubt many Competitors.—In Truth I can't help looking upon this as a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Delegation, notwithſtanding a few plauſible Circumſtances, which ſurely never entered the Author's Head, viz. the Diſgrace of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in the firſt Book, &amp;c. (a Diſgrace which, by the way, they neither of them reſent, or allude to, in their Speeches to <hi>Achilles)</hi> or the Relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Ajax</hi> to that Hero, which he takes not the leaſt Advantage of in his Addreſs to him.—Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> in the Note laſt quoted, appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather to have acted the Part of a ready Friend, than an impartial Commentator.—I will only ſuppoſe, and have done, that <hi>Diomed</hi> had been employed in this Deputation inſtead of <hi>Ajax;</hi>—in that Caſe can't you conceive Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> would have expreſſed himſelf to the following Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? <q>It is with wonderful Art and Propriety, that <hi>Homer</hi> appoints <hi>Diomed</hi> one of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors upon this Occaſion. It did Honour to <hi>Achilles</hi> to ſend upon this Buſineſs the moſt valiant, with the wiſeſt of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Commanders. Beſides, <hi>Diomed</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 1. B. v.</note>has more of the Character of <hi>Achilles</hi> himſelf, than any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. He has naturally an Exceſs of Boldneſs, and too much Fury in his Temper, forward
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0093400102:487"/>
and intrepid like the other, and running after Gods or Men promiſcuouſly as they offer themſelves. Add to this, that as he is forward to act in the Field, ſo is he ready to ſpeak in the Council; where his Advice always inclines to War; and is byaſſed rather on the Side of Bravery, than Caution. A Man of this Diſpoſition was moſt likely to influence the Congenial Spirit of <hi>Achilles.</hi>

                  <p>THE moſt material Remarks I have farther to make upon the particular Conduct of <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall communicate to you in Order, as the Paſſages which ſeem exceptionable will occur in the Courſe of the Poem. The firſt that offers itſelf is the Interpoſition of <hi>Neſtor</hi> in the firſt Book in the Speech wherein he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make up the Breach between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Princes, <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> which, as the Deſign of the <hi>Iliad</hi> required it ſhould be ineffectual, I could wiſh he had ſpared. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> obſerves, <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 339. B. i.</note> that the Character of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0093400102:488"/>
and Wiſdom in <hi>Neſtor,</hi> is every where ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably uſed by <hi>Homer,</hi> and made to exert it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through all the great Emergencies of the Poem. As he quiets the Princes here (which how he does we ſhall ſee preſently) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that Expedient which reduces the Army into order, after the Sedition in the ſecond Book. When the <hi>Greeks</hi> are in the utmoſt Diſtreſſes, 'tis he who adviſes the Building the Fortification before the Fleet, &amp;c. And 'tis by his Perſuaſion that <hi>Patroclus</hi> puts on the Armour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which occaſions the return of that Hero, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> In theſe laſt mentioned Emergencies, indeed the Authority of this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hero has all the Weight you can deſire; but ſure in the preſent Inſtance, in which if it had prevailed, all future Emergencies had been precluded, it was exerted to no, or at beſt, very little Purpoſe. The old Man is repreſented as Maſter of the Art of Perſuaſion, and riſes to ſpeak with all the Advantages of the ſweeteſt Eloquence, and the Experience of two Generations; and he ſeems accordingly to promiſe himſelf Succeſs in the Propoſal of an Accommodation.</p>

                  <p>But what Effect, after all, has this Oratory? <q>
                        <hi>Agamemnon</hi> confeſſes that all he ſpoke was right,</q> but he will not relinquiſh his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to <hi>Briſeïs.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Achilles</hi> promiſes not to fight for <hi>Briſeïs,</hi>
                     </q> but neither will he for his Country; opprobious Language is given on both Sides; <q>the Council diſſolves</q> and the Calamities of <hi>Greece</hi> enſue. For which Reaſons I think <q>the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Neſtor</hi> is thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable</q> for the great End he deſigned it.—If he had not ſpoken at all, or upon offering to do it, had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and prevented by the Fury of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who ſeems to have leſs Veneration for him, than <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> that Hero had acted in Character, and the Eloquence of the reverened Orator had never been exerciſed in vain.</p>
                  <p>The next Objection I have to make, is againſt the imprudent, and unneceſſary Meaſure taken by <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> to ſound the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0093400102:490"/>
in the ſecond Book, by propoſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Forces to <hi>Greece;</hi> a Propoſal which had taken Effect, but for the Management of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> and <hi>Neſtor.</hi> It is likely indeed, (to give you the Words of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 93. B. ii.</note>who, in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Opinion, has given us an admirable Explication of this whole Conduct) <q>
                        <hi>Agamemnon</hi> (after his Quarrel with <hi>Achilles)</hi> had nothing ſo much at Heart as to draw the <hi>Greeks</hi> to a Battle, yet knew not how to proceed without <hi>Achilles,</hi> who had juſt retired from the Army: He was apprehenſive that the <hi>Greeks</hi> who were diſpleaſed at the Departure of <hi>Achilles,</hi> might refuſe Obedience to his Orders, ſhould he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely command it. In this Circumſtance he propoſes an Expedient to the Princes in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which was that he ſhould ſound the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the People, by exhorting them to ſet ſail for <hi>Greece,</hi> but, that then, the other Princes ſhould be ready to diſſuade, and detain them.—He had ſome Cauſe to fear the <hi>Greeks</hi> had a Pique againſt him, which they had concealed, and whatever it was, he judged it abſolutely neceſſary to know it, before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a Battle. He therefore furniſhes them with an Occaſion to manifeſt it, and at the ſame Time provides againſt any ill Effects it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0093400102:491"/>
might have by his ſecret Orders to the Princes. It ſucceeds accordingly, and when the Troops are running to embark, they are ſtopped by <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> and <hi>Neſtor.</hi>
                     </q>—Now not to inſiſt upon an inaccuracy in this Note; i. e. that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> 
                     <q>judged it Neceſſary to know <hi>what</hi> the Pique the <hi>Grecians</hi> had againſt him was,</q> which if they had <hi>any, could</hi> be no other than what aroſe from "their Diſpleaſure at the departure of <hi>Achilles,"</hi> as is expreſſed in the former Part of the Note; I ſay, not to dwell upon this, the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Stratagem was not abſolutely ſuperſeded by the Viſion ſent by <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Agamemnon?</hi> The Deſign of this Viſion was to deceive him into the Hope, or rather Aſſurance of taking <hi>Troy</hi> without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Achilles.</hi> And it had its Effect. The General, perſuaded, as it were by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation, of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Favour towards him, and Concern for his Glory, and exalted with the Thought of the promiſed Succeſs to his Arms, communicates his Dream to the Princes in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who appear to a Man to be ſatisfied of the Reality of it, and of the Good-will of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cauſe. Old <hi>Neſtor</hi> gives his Advice in conſequence of this Conviction.</p>

I don't apprehend that what Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has urged from <hi>Dacier,</hi> or advanced himſelf, in order to ſalve this Inconſiſtency, will afford us ſufficient Satisfaction. <q>We ought to reflect, ſays he, that this is only a Prayer: <hi>Hector</hi> in the Exceſs of a tender Emotion for his Son, intreats the Gods to preſerve <hi>Troy,</hi> and permit <hi>Aſtyanax</hi> to rule there. It is at all Times allowable to beſeech Heaven to appeaſe its Anger, and change its Decrees; and we are taught that Prayers can alter Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.</q>—We are taught, I conceive the very Reverſe of this by the general Tenour of the Poem: This Aſſertion however, ſuppoſes <hi>Hector</hi> to have foreſeen the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the Ruin of his Family; and yet we are told in the next Sentence, <q>that it cannot be inferred from hence, that <hi>Hector</hi> had any divine Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Fate, &amp;c. ſince in many following Paſſages we find him poſſeſſed with ſtrong Hopes, &amp;c. to raiſe the Siege, &amp;c.</q> Is not this a ſort of Confuſion of Apologies, and a Defence of one Inconſiſtency by another?

                  <p>In the Caſe of <hi>Hector, Jupiter</hi> is undeniably explicit; he declares the Fate of that Hero ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, tho' he is inclined, with the Conſent of the inferiour Deities, to reſcue him from it.</p>

                  <p>So that <hi>Virgil</hi> appears at leaſt not only to have copied this Circumſtance from <hi>Homer,</hi> but to have applied it with more Juſtice; for what <hi>Juno</hi> ſaid previouſly to the Suſpenſion of the Scales, is not at leaſt ſo glaring an Impropriety as what <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> ſays here himſelf. The beſt excuſe perhaps for both theſe great Poets, we may borrow from a Note of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s, in the 20th Book, <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 41. B. xx.</note> that it was not eaſy in the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion, to form the juſteſt Ideas upon a Doctrine (viz. that of Deſtiny, the Divine Power, &amp;c.) ſo difficult to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0093400102:497"/>
be cleared; and upon which it is no great Wonder if a Poet ſhould not always be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with himſelf, when it has puzzled ſuch a Number of Divines, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I quit this Remark, I muſt juſt take Notice of an Overſight in Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> who tells us in his Note <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 88. B. viii.</note>upon the Circumſtance of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s weighing the Fates, &amp;c. that <q>This <hi>Figure</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting God as weighing the deſtinies of Men in his Balances, was firſt made uſe of in Holy Writ.</q> Are theſe only <hi>figurative</hi> Scales in <hi>Homer</hi> then? Sure <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> did not look upon them to be ſuch, when (as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> informs us from <hi>Plutarch)</hi> 
                     <q>he wrote a whole Tragedy upon this Foundation, which he called <hi>Pſycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatia,</hi> or the <hi>weighing of Souls.</hi> In this he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>Thetis</hi> and <hi>Aurora</hi> ſtanding on either Side of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Scales, and praying each for her Son, while the Heroes fought.</q> I don't ſee therefore how any Parallel can reaſonably be drawn between this Paſſage, which muſt be <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> underſtood in <hi>Homer,</hi> and thoſe <hi>figurative</hi> Expreſſions in <hi>Scripture,</hi> 
                     <q>of <hi>being weighed in the Balance,</hi> and <hi>found light,</hi> &amp;c. by which the Impartiality of divine Juſtice is ſignificantly illuſtrated to the human Underſtanding. How

far <hi>Milton</hi> may be warranted in borrowing</q> this fine Fiction from <hi>Homer,</hi> which it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged "he has admirably improved" or in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Deity with a Pair of golden <hi>Compaſſes</hi> in his Hand upon another Occaſion, it is not my preſent Buſineſs to inquire.—Thus much at leaſt may be ſaid in his Behalf, that <hi>Boldneſſes</hi> give no Offence when there is no Allay of <hi>Impiety</hi> in them.

                  <p>The Receſs <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 180. B. xx.</note>of the Gods in the 20th Book is an Incident, which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> 
                     <q>wonders all the Commentators ſhould be ſilent upon; it ſeems ſtrange at the firſt View, ſays he, that ſo many Deities, after having entered the Scene of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould perform ſo ſhort a Part and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately become themſelves Spectators.</q> I muſt indeed look upon this as an Objection to the Conduct of the Poet. Let us hear however what Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has urged in his Vindication. He <q>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives then the Reaſon of this Conduct in the Poet to be, that <hi>Achilles</hi> has been inactive dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt Part of the Poem; and as he
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0093400102:501"/>
is the Hero of it, ought to be the chief Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in it: The Poet therefore withdraws the Gods from the Field, that <hi>Achilles</hi> may have the whole Honour of the Day, and not act in Subordination to the Deities; beſides the Poem now draws to a Concluſion, and it is neceſſary for <hi>Homer</hi> to enlarge upon the Exploits of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that he may leave a noble Idea of his Valour upon the Mind of the Reader.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I would take the Liberty to aſk, whether it be derogatory to the important Character of <hi>Achilles</hi> to act in Subordination to the Deities? Whether their Superintendency and Aſſiſtance has not been an Honour to every Hero in the Courſe of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> particularly to <hi>Diomed</hi> in the fifth Book? Whether <hi>Achilles</hi> himſelf makes ſo great a Figure in this Book as he does in the next when <q>
                        <hi>Scamander</hi> attacks him with all his Waves; when <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See L. 330. B. xxi.</note>appear to aſſiſt him: <hi>Simois</hi> joins <hi>Scamander,</hi> and at length <hi>Vulcan,</hi> by the Inſtigation of <hi>Juno,</hi> almoſt dries up the River.</q> Does the Interpoſition of theſe Deities do a Diſcredit to the Valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> or <q>leave a leſs noble Idea of it upon the Mind of the Reader</q> than he would have had without it?—I dare ſay you will agree with me that what Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> obſerves in the next Note is a kind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what he has advanced in this, and be
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0093400102:502"/>
convinced that the <q>magnificent Introduction of <hi>Achilles</hi> into the Field in the Beginning of this Book, when the Gods deſcend to Battle, and all Nature is in an Uproar, is not anſwered by any ſuitable Exploits of that Hero, or by any Atchievement worthy ſo pompous, and terrible an <hi>Apparatus!</hi> After the Gods are withdrawn, <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> meet; but in the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you expect to ſee a bloody Combat, you are entertained with a tedious Converſation.</q> Take Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s own Words.—<note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 214.

                     <q>Our Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is raiſed to ſee Gods and Heroes engaged, when ſuddenly it all ſinks into ſuch a Combat in which neither Party receives a Wound; and (what is more extraordinary) the Gods are made the Spectators of ſo ſmall an Action. What Occaſion was there for Thunder, Earthquakes, and deſcending Deities to introduce a Matter of ſo little Importance. Neither is it any Excuſe to ſay the Poet has given us a Piece of <hi>ancient Hiſtory,</hi> we expected to read a Poet not an Hiſtorian. In ſhort after the greateſt Preparation for Action imaginable, he ſuſpends the whole Narration, and from the Heat of a Poet, cools at once into the Simplicity of an Hiſtorian.</q>

                  <p>I can't help aſking here, whether this be the firſt Time <hi>Homer</hi> is faulty in this Reſpect? To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s ingenious Juſtification of the

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is willing to believe, however, that an <hi>Allegory</hi> may be couched under all this, and I wiſh any Body could diſcover it: In the mean Time I can't but obſerve, that 'tis great Pity the Gods and Goddeſſes that often appear ſo nobly in ſeparate <hi>Machines</hi> throughout the <hi>Iliad,</hi> ſhould make ſo mean a Figure in the preſent Battle.</p>
                  <p>I muſt requeſt your Attention to one Incident more, which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> would fain reconcile us to, viz. the Flight of <hi>Hector</hi> in the 22d Book. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

that what that Commentator alledges from the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 180. B. xxii.</note>Conduct of <hi>Virgil,</hi> 
                     <q>who transferred this Paſſage to the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi>
                     </q> and likewiſe from the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is extremely inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his Purpoſe. <hi>Turnus</hi> is a Character much inferiour to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and therefore we are little ſhocked at his running away from him. But this is confeſſedly not the Caſe, the Point of mere Strength excepted, with <hi>Hector</hi> when compared to <hi>Achilles.</hi> It was, you'll ſay, that very Strength which he feared—was it not, that very Strength too, which he had frequently encountered? And if it was not <hi>neceſſary</hi> he <hi>ſhould</hi> fly; I will venture to ſay it is a Circumſtance infinitely <hi>diſagreeable</hi> to the Reader, that he <hi>does.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor farther is "the Suffrage of <hi>Ariſtotle"</hi> himſelf, if I underſtand it at all, ſatisfactory upon this Point. <q>The <hi>wonderful,</hi> ſays he, ought to have Place in Tragedy, but ſtill more in Epic Poetry, which proceeds in this Point even to the <hi>unreaſonable:</hi> For as in Epic Poems one ſees not the Perſons acting, ſo whatever <hi>paſſes the Bounds of Reaſon,</hi> is proper to Produce the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable</hi> and the <hi>marvellous.</hi> For Example, what <hi>Homer</hi> ſays of <hi>Hector</hi> purſued by <hi>Achilles,</hi> would appear ridiculous on the Stage; for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to ſee on
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0093400102:508"/>
one Side the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtanding without any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and on the other, <hi>Achilles</hi> purſuing <hi>Hector</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. But all this does not appear when we read the Poem; for what is <hi>wonderful,</hi> is always <hi>agreeable,</hi> and as a Proof of it, we find that they who relate any Thing, uſually add ſomething to the Truth, that it may the better pleaſe thoſe who hear it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can we infer from all this, but that the Flight of <hi>Hector</hi> round the Walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> is an <hi>Action,</hi> which, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> will much better bear being <hi>told,</hi> than repreſented? No doubt of it—but is an Action, all this while, which is <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> in itſelf, <hi>therefore agreeable, becauſe</hi> it may be <hi>told</hi> with Propriety? Do we never <hi>wonder</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>admiring,</hi> or <hi>marvel</hi> with <hi>Diſguſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Delight?</hi> I <hi>will grant</hi> this Incident renders this Part of the Poem more <hi>aſtoniſhing,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays in a ſubſequent Paragraph of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Note; but why it is more <hi>admirable,</hi> I am quite at a loſs to conceive.</p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> urges himſelf in Vindication of this Circumſtance, has much more Weight in it; as <q>that <hi>Hector</hi> never thought himſelf a Match for <hi>Achilles;</hi> that this Incident is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by Degrees, as <hi>Dacier</hi> has obſerved too; that, the mere Sight and Voice of <hi>Achilles</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, has terrified and put the whole <hi>Trojan</hi> Army into Diſorder: That <hi>Hector</hi> ſtays, not that
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0093400102:509"/>
he Hopes to overcome <hi>Achilles,</hi> but becauſe, Shame, &amp;c. forbid him to re-enter the City; that he ſtayed by the immediate <hi>Will of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> irreſiſtibly bound down by Fate: That he had been reflecting on the Injuſtice of the War he maintained; that his Spirits are depreſſed by Heaven: That he flies not from <hi>Achilles</hi> as a mortal Hero, but from one whom he ſees clad in impenetrable Armour, ſeconded by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> which Conſiderations do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed amount to a Proof of the <hi>Probability</hi> of <hi>Hector</hi>'s Flight, but, I think, are no Argument for the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of it. In ſhort, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf ſays, <q>he don't abſolutely pretend to juſtify this Paſſage in every Point,</q> I preſume I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, if <hi>Hector</hi> had ſtood his Ground, we ſhould have liked the Poem better for it.</p>
                  <p>I can't think, by the way, that it is <q>a high Exaltation of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that ſo brave a Man as <hi>Hector</hi> durſt not <hi>ſtand him.</hi>
                     </q> It would methinks have redounded more to <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Glory, had <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> been repreſented as a <hi>Match</hi> for him. Indeed <q>this great Event, wherein the whole Fate of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Troy</hi> was decided by the Sword of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi>
                     </q> does leſs Honour to that Hero than any one Action he had been engaged in, for the laſt of the above Reaſons alledged for <hi>Hector</hi>'s Flight, and beſauſe <q>he <hi>knew</hi> that <hi>Hector</hi> was to fall by his Hand.</q> He was aſſured of this by <hi>Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> in the 21ſt.

                  <p>IF you conſider the <hi>Iliad</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> with any thing of exactneſs of Attention, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive numberleſs Marks of a Genius, thoughtleſs of, or, it may be, ſuperiour to the Niceties, and Proprieties in which the Excellencies of ſecond-rate Authors wholly conſiſt. To what has been offered already for the Illuſtration of this Truth you may add, if you pleaſe, the <hi>Repetitions</hi> with which <hi>Homer</hi> ſo much abounds. I am far from aſſerting that theſe are never proper, tho' they are often, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> confeſſes, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note at L. 570. B. viii.</note>viſibly abſurd. I will only point out one Place, where it is owing to a <hi>Repetition,</hi> that the very Deſign of the Author cannot eaſily be underſtood: I mean the Speech of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the 9th Book, wherein he propoſes to the Generals to quit the Siege, &amp;c. <q>The Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks <note n="†" place="bottom">See Note at L. 23. B. ix.</note>are divided in their Opinion, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> acquaints us, whether this Speech, which is Word for Word the ſame with that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> makes in the 2d Book, be only a Feint to try the Army, as it is there, or the real Sentiments of the General.</q> Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays, <q>He does not pretend to decide upon this Point</q> nor is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of any great Conſequence, any farther than as it makes good what has been remarked; however that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> upon this Occaſion ſpoke his real Sentiments is, I think moſt probable, becauſe upon a Parallel one in the 14th Book, he propoſes the very
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0093400102:512"/>
ſame Thing to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes, tho' in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Words.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is in my Opinion more reaſonable to put the frequent <hi>Incongruities</hi> we meet with in <hi>Homer</hi> to the Account of Inadvertency, &amp;c. than to reconcile them by forced and unnatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.

Nay, I will go a Step further, and grant you with much Satisfaction that this celebrated <hi>Tranſlator</hi> always errs on the right Side, and even when he does not do his Reader <hi>Juſtice,</hi> never fails to do <hi>Honour</hi> to his <hi>Original:</hi> I ſhould rather ſay, to <hi>himſelf;</hi> for if Boldneſs of Figure, Force of Expreſſion, Smoothneſs and Eaſe of Numbers, and the Correſpondence of Sound with Senſe, be the great Beauties of poetical Diction, I ſhould make no Scruple, upon the whole, to prefer the <hi>Engliſh Iliad,</hi> to the <hi>Greek.</hi> But theſe very Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are in ſome Sort his Errors, and what I admire in this <hi>Poem,</hi> I can't help often conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as blameable in the <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> In ſhort, it is the <hi>Over-poeticalneſs</hi> of this <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> if I may ſo call it, which I take to be exceptionable in many Place. And yet, as there was no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſo naturally a warm <hi>Tranſlator</hi>'s ſinking into Flatneſs, and Inſipidity, ſo one would have thought he had laid himſelf under Reſtraints ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have prevented his ever ſoaring into the other Extreme of Rapture, and Extravagance.—There is not more <hi>Fire</hi> in any one Part of the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> than there is good Senſe and cool Reaſoning in the following Extract from the <hi>Preface.</hi> 
                     <q>It ſhould be conſidered what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods may afford ſome Equivalent in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage for the Graces of theſe (viz. the <hi>Diction</hi> and <hi>Verſification)</hi> in the <hi>Greek.</hi> It is certain
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0093400102:518"/>
no literal Tranſlation can be juſt to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Original in a ſuperior Language; but it is a great Miſtake to imagine that a raſh Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe can make Amends for this general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; which is no leſs in Danger to loſe the Spirit of an Ancient, by deviating into the modern Manners of Expreſſion. If there be ſometimes a Darkneſs, there is often a Light in Antiquity, which nothing better preſerves than a Verſion almoſt literal. I know no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties one ought to take, but thoſe which are neceſſary for tranſlating the Spirit of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and ſupporting the poetical Style of the Tranſlation: And I will venture to ſay, there have not been more Men miſled in former Times by a ſervile dull Adherence to the Letter, than have been deluded in ours, by a chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical inſolent Hope of raiſing and improving their Author. It is not to be doubted that the <hi>Fire</hi> of the Poem is what a Tranſlator ſhould principally regard, as it is moſt likely to expire in his managing: However it is his ſafeſt Way to be content with preſerving this to his utmoſt in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is, in any particular Place. 'Tis a great Secret in writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; and it is what <hi>Homer</hi> will teach us, if we will but follow modeſtly in his Footſteps.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0093400102:519"/>
Where his Diction is bold and lofty, let us raiſe ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from imitating him by the fear of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Cenſure of a mere <hi>Engliſh</hi> Critick. Nothing that belongs to <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems to have been more commonly miſtaken than the juſt Pitch of his Style; ſome of his Tranſlators ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſwelled into Fuſtian in a proud Confidence of the <hi>Sublime:</hi> Others ſunk into Flatneſs in a cold and timorous Notion of <hi>Simplicity.</hi>—There is a graceful, and dignified Simplicity, as well as a bald and ſordid one, &amp;c.—'Tis one Thing to be nicked up, and another not to be dreſſed at all. Simplicity is the mien between Oſtentation and Ruſticity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> had always conducted his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conformably to theſe juſt Sentiments, it would have been the moſt <hi>exact,</hi> as it is now the moſt <hi>Spirited</hi> one extant: But, I believe, you will by and by be convinced that he has often <hi>modernized</hi> his Original too much, and ſacrificed the true Simplicity of the Antients in general, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Air, and Caſt of his Author, either to an Exceſs of Affection for him, and Deſire to ſet his Work in the moſt advantageous Light to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Reader, or to an undue Fear of leſſening and injuring him thro' the Inferiority of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the <hi>Grecian</hi> in many Reſpects. To one or
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0093400102:520"/>
both of thoſe we are indebted, I preſume, for many bold Strokes of Poetry, and fine Pieces of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Imagery, which are not ſo much Copies of, as Refinements on, the Original.</p>
                  <p>And, by the Way, it may be remarked that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould have been more than ordinarily cautious upon this Article, as he was under an abſolute Neceſſity of <hi>ſinking</hi> ſome Peculiarities in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Diction, which would not bear Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting into our <hi>Tongue.</hi> Such are his <hi>compound Epithets,</hi> and <hi>Repetitions.</hi> How our <hi>Tranſlator</hi> has acquitted himſelf with regard to theſe, you will be beſt informed by conſulting himſelf. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Preface to Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Homer.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is however to be obſerved in general, that every Thing <hi>characteriſtical</hi> in an Author, is, as far as may be, to be moſt religiouſly retained; and that, notwithſtanding the allowed occaſional Uſe of the <hi>Periphraſis,</hi> or <hi>Circumlocution,</hi> the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of Words, and the <hi>Subſtitution</hi> of one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Room of another, &amp;c. &amp;c. by Means of which the Spirit of an Original is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved without Prejudice to the literal Senſe, all imaginable Care is to be taken that theſe Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under the Pretence of maintaining and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting this Spirit, do not really over-power, and extinguiſh it. <hi>Redundancies</hi> are as <hi>unoriginal</hi> as <hi>Inſipidities,</hi> and the Spirit of an Author may be
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0093400102:521"/>
as much overwhelmed in Exuberance on the one Hand, as it evaporates in Frigidity on the other.—<hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are ſcarce more oppoſite than Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and that of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> by Dr. <hi>Trapp;</hi> I am apt to think we ſhall often form very wrong Ideas of theſe Poems if we regulate them by theſe reſpective Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſeems to have exalted the true Simplicity of <hi>Homer,</hi> as "graceful and dignified" as it is, in the ſame Degree that the <hi>Doctor</hi> has debaſed the Majeſty of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will begin to think it high Time I ſhould make good this Charge, which I ſhall accordingly endeavour to do by pointing to a few ſelect Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of Numbers that might be produced, in which you will plainly diſcover certain <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and <hi>Prettyneſſes,</hi> (for you muſt gratify me in the Uſe of that Term for them) and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Mixture of both, that were taken from the Store-houſe of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s own Imagination, and are utterly foreign to, and deſtructive of, the plain Scope, and unaffected Spirit of his Author.</p>
                  <p>There is not perhaps in all the <hi>Iliad</hi> a more pompous Deſcription than that of <hi>Achilles</hi> arming himſelf in the 19th Book. The Compariſons, and Images, (as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> well obſerves) <q>riſe in a noble Scale one above another; the Hero is ſet in a ſtill ſtronger Point of Light than before, till he is at laſt in a Manner covered over with
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0093400102:522"/>
Glories; he is at firſt likened to the Moonlight, then to the Flames of a Beacon, then to a Comet, and laſtly to the Sun itſelf.</q> But with all this Sublimity, and almoſt <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> there is a Simplicity which is, I conceive, loſt in that Exaggeration of Imagery with which the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator has embeliſhed the Paſſage. The whole Deſcription, which is too long to be tranſcribed, is rather looſely paraphraſed perhaps than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but the Parts I have marked are ſo many beautiful Excreſcencies, which have no Sort of Warrant from the Letter, or moſt of them even from the Import of the Text.</p>

                  <p>The Affectation of Poetry in all theſe Places has diffuſed an Air over Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Tranſlation</hi> quite different from the neat, but generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornamented Style of his Author, to which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible <hi>ſimplex munditiis</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi> may perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently enough be applied.

                  <p>I have often thought it was with the ſame View to <hi>Ornament,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> wrote his <hi>Tranſlation</hi> in Rhime. However what Advantages were hereby gained we ſhall ſee preſently; but it is certain in the mean time that by the Uſe of it, the Tranſlation becomes abſolutely <hi>modern,</hi> and in its very <hi>Form unlike</hi> the Original. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> ſays in his Dedication prefixed to his <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> 
                     <q>that he who can write well in Rhime, may write better in blank Verſe;</q> and that <q>Rhime is a Conſtraint even to the beſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and thoſe who make it with moſt Eaſe; that what it adds to Sweetneſs, it takes away from Senſe; and that it often makes us ſwerve from an Author's Meaning.</q>—I wiſh, by the by, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> had not aſſerted one Way and <hi>tranſlated</hi> another.—It is plain the <hi>Superfluities</hi> complained of in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> are in a great Meaſure to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to this Method of <hi>Tranſlation.</hi>

This whole Paſſage, which makes ſo <hi>pretty</hi> a <hi>Figure</hi> in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Hands, if literally (I mean fairly) tranſlated, and that too in <hi>blank</hi> Verſe, would undoubtedly be very flat and ſpiritleſs.

are more juſt <hi>Tranſlations</hi> than any two Lines of the whole Number though they have neither <hi>Fire,</hi> nor <hi>Fancy</hi> in them. In ſuch Places as theſe <hi>Rhime</hi> may among other Expedients help to ſave the <hi>poetical</hi> Character of an Author by giving a <hi>ſeeming</hi> Equivalent for <hi>Spirit</hi> in <hi>Sound.</hi>—But why muſt a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> be beautiful and poetical when the <hi>Original</hi> is not ſo?—It is the Buſineſs of a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator</hi> to give us the <hi>whole</hi> of an Author, not at <hi>all</hi> Events to make the <hi>beſt</hi> of him.—I will venture to ſay that had Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> obliged the World with a <hi>blank</hi> Verſe Tranſlation of <hi>Homer,</hi> at the ſame Time that he would have <hi>more</hi> effectually preſerved the <hi>Air,</hi> he would have deviated <hi>leſs</hi> from the <hi>Senſe</hi> of his Author; and that his Verſion upon the <hi>whole</hi> would have been as poetical, as animated, and even as harmonious as the preſent. Dr. <hi>Trapp</hi> obſerves, I think, very juſtly in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the Aeneid, that <q>blank Verſe is not only more majeſtic &amp;c. but more muſical and harmonious than Rhime: It has, ſays he, more <hi>Rhime</hi> in it according to the ancient and true Senſe of the Word, than
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0093400102:533"/>
                        <hi>Rhime</hi> itſelf as it is now uſed. For, in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Signification, it conſiſts not in the tinkling of Vowels and Conſonants, but in the metrical Diſpoſition of Words and Syllables, and the proper Cadence of Numbers; which is more agreeable to the Ear, without the jingling of like Endings than with it.</q>—After all, the <hi>Meaſure</hi> in <hi>blank</hi> Verſe does <hi>really</hi> and ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſtinguiſh it from <hi>mere</hi> Proſe; and if ſo, <hi>Rhime</hi> is not wanted for this Purpoſe. Nor can it be pretended that the ſtrong <hi>Colours</hi> of Poetry, the Beauties of Deſcription, Figures, Images, &amp;c. &amp;c. are capable of being diſplayed to more Advantage in <hi>Rhime,</hi> than in <hi>blank</hi> Verſe.—Indeed <hi>theſe</hi> are not peculiar even to Poetry; they are independent on <hi>Metre,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive not Energy or Strength, but Gracefulneſs only and Dignity from <hi>Numbers.</hi>—They are <hi>fitter</hi> for <hi>Verſe</hi> than <hi>Proſe,</hi> but not more <hi>eſſential</hi> to it.—Thus the bold <hi>Figures, Similies,</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>Homer</hi> would be of the ſame intrinſic Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue out of <hi>Meaſure,</hi> as in it;—as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the way, though literally tranſlated in plain <hi>Proſe,</hi> are in numberleſs Inſtances <hi>poetical,</hi> though they are by no means a <hi>Poem.</hi>—It is not for the ſake of <hi>Luſtre,</hi> but <hi>Order,</hi> that Diamonds and Pearls are ranged upon a String.—But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>—Whatever Credit his <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may have done the Original by heightening
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0093400102:534"/>
and improving it in ſome Reſpects, by Means of <hi>Rhime</hi> (and thereby ſkreening ſometimes a Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity or perhaps a Flatneſs, and Frigidity of Diction which <hi>Homer</hi> only was anſwerable for) 'tis as true too that it ſometimes by Reaſon <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>Rhime</hi> falls ſhort of it, and is leſs beautiful and ſignificant in itſelf. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is very happy in his Imitations of thoſe Paſſages where <hi>Homer</hi> "applies the Sound to the Senſe" (ſee particularly B. i. Ver. 451. &amp;c. B. x. Ver. 444. &amp;c. B. xiii. Ver. 191. &amp;c. B. xiii. Ver. 1005.) but he would have ſucceeded ſtill more in theſe Places, I preſume, had he been uncumbered with the Shackles of <hi>Rhime.</hi> How much better and ſtronger would the following Lines have appeared without <hi>Rhimes</hi> than with them.</p>

                  <p>AFTER reading my laſt, you will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hear me wiſhing <hi>Rhimes</hi> were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly baniſhed from <hi>Great Poetry;</hi> by which the Critics underſtand the <hi>Epopee,</hi> and the <hi>Drama.</hi> How far they may be requiſite, or even beautiful in <hi>Lyric, Elegiac, Paſtoral,</hi> &amp;c. or eſpecially <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactic Poetry</hi> I ſhall not enquire; but 'tis certain they are in general rather Obſtructions than Helps towards the great Purpoſes of firing the Heart, and moving the Paſſions.—You need only read over your <hi>Milton,</hi> and the beſt <hi>Tragedies</hi> of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare</hi> to be convinced of this.—And if I would have ev'ry <hi>Firſt-Rate, Original</hi> Poem written in <hi>blank</hi> Verſe for the Sake of the <hi>Ear,</hi> as well as the <hi>Heart,</hi> I muſt ſtill more ſtrongly recommend the Uſe of the ſame to <hi>Tranſlations.—Rhime</hi> is ſo abhorrent from the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of the antient Poetry, that nothing but the abſolute Neceſſity of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0093400102:536"/>
it can, I think, render it diſpenſable in an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Verſion.—Now <hi>convenient</hi> it may ſometimes be, but it is never <hi>neceſſary</hi>—Whatever are the Imperfections, and Defects of our Language, they are, it is my Opinion, ſuch, as <hi>Rhime,</hi> tho' it may <hi>diſguiſe,</hi> can never <hi>ſupply.</hi> But I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> from <hi>Poetry,</hi> as well as <hi>Religion,</hi> and confeſs for my own Part, that I had much rather ſee a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> in <hi>ſome</hi> Places <hi>inferior</hi> to its Original, than unlike it in <hi>all.</hi> If upon the <hi>whole</hi> not only the very <hi>Caſt,</hi> but the Senſe and Spirit of an Author may be better preſerved in <hi>blank</hi> Verſe than <hi>Rhime,</hi> every reaſonable Critic will make Allowances for the Poverty, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inferiority of our Mother Tongue. Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi>'s Tranſlation of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is a very noble one; tho' I cannot conceive what induced him to give it us in <hi>Rhime,</hi> unleſs it was the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Inequality of our Language to the Diction of his Author where it is moſt plain, and unpoetical. Indeed <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> are the chief <hi>Characteriſtics</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> as <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Vivacity</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Homer;</hi> for which Reaſon I ſhould imagine the latter a more <hi>attemptable</hi> Author, than the former, if Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> had not precluded every Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this Nature, even tho' he wrote in <hi>Rhime.</hi> For bold <hi>Figures,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Paintings,</hi> and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Colourings</hi> may be ransfuſed from one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0093400102:537"/>
to another: but <hi>Purity, Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Elegance,</hi> tho' they are the ſame things in all Tongues, are not equally ſtriking in them all.—However, no <hi>Tranſlation</hi> can go farther than the <hi>Genius</hi> of our Language will admit; and even with regard to <hi>Virgil,</hi> it will go, I am inclined to believe, far enough to convey a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Idea of this noble Original in <hi>all</hi> its Parts. It will go farther at leaſt without <hi>Rhime,</hi> than with it. Dr. <hi>Trapp</hi> indeed, than whom no Body better <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> his Author, by too ſuperſtitious an Adherence to the <hi>Letter,</hi> and particularly a fruitleſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Endeavour to retain the <hi>Brevity</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> is cold and languid upon numberleſs Occaſions; and has thereby perhaps contributed more to the Diſreputation of <hi>blank</hi> Verſe, than any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was offended, and not without Reaſon, with the <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but his <hi>ſqueamiſhneſs</hi> has carried him into the other Extreme; for if Mr. <hi>Dryden runs away</hi> from <hi>Virgil,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> is <hi>tied to him.</hi>—There is, by the by, this obſervable Difference, between Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Deviations from <hi>Virgil,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s from <hi>Homer,</hi> that thoſe of the latter are always uniform, graceful, and beautiful, and if they are not <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Thoughts</hi> are at leaſt <hi>worthy</hi> of him; whereas Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> is apt to dwindle into a kind of <hi>Puerility,</hi> which was but too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him, that is altogether unſuitable to the

                     <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Virgil.</hi>—Between this <hi>Tranſlator</hi> then and Dr. <hi>Trapp,</hi> there lay a <hi>middle</hi> Way, which Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi> has judiciouſly taken, and religiouſly purſued, to the immortal Glory of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> to his own infinite Honour, and the Credit of our Language. Notwithſtanding all this, I think, he has left Room for a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of <hi>another Kind</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Trapp</hi> ſays of <hi>his,</hi> when compared with Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s) by writing in <hi>Rhime.</hi>—I attempted ſome time ago, for my own Amuſement, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome of the <hi>Speeches</hi> in the firſt Book of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> into <hi>blank</hi> Verſe, from a Notion that <hi>Virgil</hi>
