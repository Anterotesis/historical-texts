            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EULOGIES OF HOWARD.</head>
            <p>IT was my chance to be converſing with a Friend of the benevolent and indefatigable HOWARD, when our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was firſt afflicted with the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his death. After our firſt expreſſion of ſurprize and ſorrow, we naturally fell into ſerious and affectionate reflections on the gentle character and ſublime purſuits of the deceaſed. On theſe articles we had no difference of opinion; but in the courſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation a point aroſe, on which our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0332001500:4"/>
ſentiments were directly oppoſite, though we were equally ſincere and ardent in our regret and veneration for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Worthy, to whom it related. I happened to ſpeak of the public ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that, I hoped, a grateful, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, a magnificent Nation would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his memory. My companion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately exclaimed, "that every os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatious memorial, to commemorate the virtues of his friend, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the meekneſs and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the man; that all, who had the happineſs of knowing HOWARD, muſt recollect with what genuine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty he had ever retired from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic admiration of thoſe, who had hoped to gratify his ambition by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved applauſe; that he had really ſought no reward but in the approbation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0332001500:5"/>
of his conſcience and his GOD; that the Britiſh Nation, however eminent for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and munificence, could not deviſe any poſthumous honours, or raiſe any monument, truly worthy of HOWARD, except in adopting and accompliſhing thoſe benevolent projects which his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy and experience had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to public attention for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of mankind."</p>
            <p>I readily admitted the ſingular and unqueſtionable modeſty of the deceaſed. —I allowed that the nobleſt tribute of reſpect, which the world could render to ſo pure a ſpirit, would be to realize his ideas; but I contended, that other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are ſtill due to his name; that it is the duty and the intereſt of mankind to commemorate his character with the fondeſt veneration. I reminded my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0332001500:6"/>
that although we were ſincerely convinced that no human mind, engaged in great deſigns, could be more truly modeſt than that of HOWARD; yet we had particular reaſon to recollect, that he was not inſenſible to praiſe. He had once imparted to us his feelings on that ſubject with a frank and tender ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, highly graceful in an upright and magnanimous being, conſcious of no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent that he could wiſh to conceal. Indeed, a ſincere and ardent paſſion for virtue could hardly ſubſiſt with a diſdain of true glory, which is nothing more than the proper teſtimony of intelligent and honeſt admiration to the exiſtence of merit: nor is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the fondeſt expreſſions of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from a world, which he has ſerved and enlightened, can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0332001500:7"/>
to the ſpirit of "a juſt man made perfect;" ſince we are taught by Religion, that the gratitude of mankind is acceptable even to GOD. I endeavoured to convince my companion, that, as the Publick had ſeen in HOWARD a perſon who reflected more genuine honour on our country than any of her Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, her Poets, her Orators, her He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, or Divines, it is incumbent on the Nation to conſult her own glory by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating, in the fulleſt manner, his beneficent exertions, and by eſtabliſhing the dignity of his unrivaled virtue.</p>
            <p>My arguments, and my zeal, made ſome impreſſion on the mind of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt; and ſunk ſo deeply into my own, that on my retiring to reſt they gave riſe to the following viſion.</p>
            <p>I was ſuddenly tranſported to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of a region, which aſtoniſhed me
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0332001500:8"/>
by its lovelineſs and extent; it was called, The Paradiſe of true Glory. As I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the entrance, my eyes were delightfully faſcinated by two beings of human form, who preſided over the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Their names were Genius and Senſibility:—it was their office to gratify with a view of this Paradiſe every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal that revered them ſincerely; and to reject only ſuch intruders as preſumed to treat either the one or the other with the inſolence of diſdain, or the coldneſs of contempt: an incident that I ſhould have thought impoſſible, from the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent beauty which is viſible in each; but, to my ſurprize, they informed me it very frequently happened.</p>
            <p>As I readily paid them the unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed homage of my ſoul, I was graciouſly permitted to paſs the gate.—Immediately
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0332001500:9"/>
as I entered, I was ſaluted with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphic ſmile, by two benignant and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Spirits: theſe were Gratitude and Admiration, the joint rulers of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion —"You are welcome," ſaid the firſt, in a tone of angelic tenderneſs— "You are welcome to a ſcene utterly new to your ſenſes, and in harmony with your heart: you delight in the praiſes of the deſerving: and you are now wafted to a ſpot, where thoſe who have merited highly of mankind are praiſed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their deſert, and where the praiſe of exalted merit is fondly liſtened to by an extenſive human audience, here purified by our ſupernatural agency from all the low and little jealouſies of the earth."</p>
            <p>I had hardly anſwered this pleaſing information by a grateful obeiſance to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0332001500:10"/>
my radiant informer, when I perceived, in a gorgeous proſpect that now opened before us, three ſtructures of ſtupendous ſize and ſuperior magnificence. The firſt was ſituated in a grove of olives, and appeared to me like an ancient tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Attica, remarkable for maſſive ſtrength, and a ſober dignity—the ſecond was leſs ſolid, but richer in decoration; and ſeemed to be almoſt ſurrounded by every tree and plant on which Nature has beſtowed any ſalutary virtue: the third was ſhaded only by palms; the form of it was ſo wonderfully grand and aweful, that it ſtruck me as a ſanctuary for every pure and devout ſpirit from all the nations of the globe.</p>
            <p>"Theſe ſtructures, that you ſurvey with aſtoniſhment," ſaid one of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent conductors, "are devoted to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0332001500:11"/>
what you mortals denominate the three liberal profeſſions, Law, Medicine, and Theology. Whoever has a claim to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed honour from any one of the three, has a juſt encomium pronounced upon his ſervices by the temporary Preſident of that particular fabrick, in which he is entitled to ſuch grateful remembrance." "Alas!" I replied, with a murmur that I could not ſuppreſs, "the Man whoſe well-deſerved praiſes I moſt anxiouſly expected to hear in this region, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to any one of theſe eminent claſſes in human life—he had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion but that of Humanity."</p>
            <p>"Be patient," ſaid the ſweeteſt of my aetherial guides, with a rebuke that was ſoftened by a ſmile of indulgence! "Let not your zeal for the honour of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, however meritorious, make you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0332001500:12"/>
unjuſt, or inſenſible, to the merit of others! Aſſume the temper of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where praiſe is diſtributed by equity and affection, but where prejudice and partiality are not allowed to intrude!— Let us advance," continued my monitor, with an encouraging movement of her hand; "it is time that I ſhould lead you to the neareſt aſſembly."</p>
            <p>I obeyed with reverential ſilence; and as I paſſed the veſtibule of the majeſtic edifice, my heart panted with an aweful expectation of beholding the ſhades of Solon, Lycurgus, and other departed Legiſlators, from the various nations of the world. I was chearfully ſurprized by a very different ſpectacle.</p>
            <p>The capacious ſtructure was filled with a concourſe of living mortals, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet reſpectable in their appearance,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0332001500:13"/>
evidently belonging to many countries; but all, as I perceived by their habits, connected with the Law. Throughout all the multitude I heard no ſound of diſſention or debate: but over all there reigned an air of intelligence and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, while all were huſhed in ſilent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance, and eager attention, with their eyes directed to an elevated tribunal:— On this a perſonage was ſitting, whoſe majeſtic figure I immediately recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His countenance is marked with that auſterity and grandeur, which are the external characteriſticks of Law her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His heart, as thoſe who know it intimately declare, expreſſes the tender and beneficent influence of that Power, who is the acknowledged parent of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and comfort. With a voice that pervaded the moſt diſtant receſſes of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0332001500:14"/>
extenſive dome, and in tones that ſunk deep into the boſom of every auditor, he pronounced the following oration:</p>
            <p>"After paſſing many years of life in the painful inveſtigation of human of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, it is with peculiar ſatisfaction that I find myſelf commiſſioned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate, in this Aſſembly, a character of virtue without example—a character, at once ſo meek and ſo ſublime, that, if a feeling ſpirit had been poiſoned with miſanthropy from too cloſe a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of mortal crimes, this character alone might ſerve as an antidote to the worſt of mental diſtempers, and awaken the moſt callous and ſarcaſtic mind to confeſs the dignity of our Nature, and the beneficence of our God. In ſtating to you the merits of HOWARD, I might expatiate with delight on the various
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0332001500:15"/>
qualities of this incomparable man; I might trace his progreſs through the different periods of a life always ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and always inſtructive. I could not be checked by any fear of overſtepping the modeſty of Truth in the celebration of Virtue, ſo ſolid and ſo extenſive, that the malevolence of Envy could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh its weight, the fondneſs of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam could not amplify its effects. But I muſt not forget that there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional limits to my diſcourſe. It is incumbent on me to confine myſelf to a ſingle object, and to dwell only on thoſe public ſervices, that peculiarly endear the name of HOWARD to the liberal and enlightened community in which I have the honour to preſide.</p>
            <p>"It was in the capacity of a Miniſter to Juſtice, that the pure ſpirit, whom it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0332001500:16"/>
is my glory to praiſe, firſt conceived the idea of thoſe unrivaled labours that have rendered his memory a treaſure to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In diſcharging a temporary office, that expoſed to him the condition of criminals, he was led to meditate on the evils which had grievouſly contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the operations of Juſtice. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Law herſelf, like one of her moſt illuſtrious Delegates (I mean the immortal Bacon), was groſsly injured by the ſecret and ſordid enormities of her menial ſervants: that Captivity and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion, thoſe neceſſary ſupporters of her power, inſtead of producing good, often gave birth to miſchiefs more flagrant, and more fatal, than thoſe which they were employed to correct. He found, even in the priſons of his own humane and enlightened country, an accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0332001500:17"/>
of the moſt hideous abuſes: he found them not nurſeries of penitence and amendment, but ſchools of vice and impiety; or dens of filth, famine, and diſeaſe: not the ſeats of juſt and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary correction and puniſhment, but the ſtrong holds of cruelty and extortion. The irons of the priſoner, which he only beheld, entered into his ſoul, and awakened unextinguiſhable energy in a ſpirit, of which compaſſion and fortitude were the divine characteriſticks. In the noble emotions of pity for the oppreſſed, and of zeal for the honour and intereſt of civilized ſociety, he conceived per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſublimeſt deſign that ever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied and exalted the mind of man, the deſign to ſearch and to purify the polluted ſtream of Penal Juſtice, not only throughout his own country, but through
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0332001500:18"/>
the various nations of the world. How low, how little, are the grandeſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of Heroic Ambition, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this magnanimous purſuit! How frivolous and vain are the higheſt aims of Fancy and Science, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with a purpoſe ſo beneficently great! But, marvellous as the magnitude of HOWARD's enterpriſe appears, on the ſlighteſt view that magnitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes doubly ſtriking, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template at the ſame time the many circumſtances that might either allure or deter him from the proſecution of his idea. Conſider him as a private gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, poſſeſſed of eaſe and independence, accuſtomed to employ and amuſe his mind in retired ſtudy and philoſophical ſpeculation; arrived at that period of life, when the ſprings of activity and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0332001500:19"/>
enterprize in the human frame have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to loſe their force! conſider that his health, even in youth, had appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to common fatigue! his ſtature low! his deportment humble! his voice almoſt effeminate! Such was the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful being, who relinquiſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, the tranquillity, the comforts, that he loved and enjoyed, to embark in labours at which the moſt hardy might tremble; to plunge in perils from which the moſt reſolute might recede without a diminution of honour. Under all theſe apparent diſadvantages, unſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, unauthorized by any Prince, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excited by any popular invitation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to inveſtigate all the abuſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; to viſit the abodes of wretchedneſs and infection; and to prove himſelf the friend of the friendleſs, in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0332001500:20"/>
every country that the limits of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced life would allow him to examine. Againſt ſuch an enterprize, projected by ſuch an individual, what forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be urged, not only by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelfiſh paſſion, but even by that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that reaſon, which are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to regulate an elevated mind! How plauſibly did Friendſhip exclaim to HOWARD, 'Your projects are unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably noble; but they are above the execution of any individual: you are unarmed with authority; you have the wiſh to do great good, but the power of doing little! Conſider the probable iſſue of the undertaking!—You will ſee a few hapleſs wretches, and tell their condition to the inattentive world; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps periſh yourſelf from contagion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have time to tell it; and leave
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0332001500:21"/>
your afflicted friends to lament your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate, and the ungrateful Publick to deride your temerity!' What force of intellect, what dignity of ſoul were required to prevent a mortal from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remonſtrances ſo engaging! The divine energy of Genius and of Virtue enabled HOWARD to foreſee, that the ſanctity of his purſuit would ſupply him with ſtrength and powers far ſuperior to all human authority:—His piercing mind comprehended that there are enormities of ſuch a nature, that to ſurvey and to reveal them is to effect their correction. —He felt that his ſincere compaſſion for the oppreſſed, and his ardent deſire to promote perfect juſtice, would ſerve him as a perpetual antidote againſt the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of fear.—He felt that in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of dungeons he ſhould want no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0332001500:22"/>
no guards to defend him againſt the outrages of detected extortion, or ſuſpicious brutality.—He felt, that as his purpoſe was heavenly, the powers of Heaven would be diſplayed in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; that iniquity and oppreſſion would not dare to lift a hand againſt him, though they knew it was the buſineſs of his life to annihilate their ſway in their moſt ſecret dominion. How admirably did the progreſs of his travels evince and juſtify the pure and enlightened confidence of his ſpirit! All dangers, all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vaniſh before his gentleneſs, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, his perſeverance. Inſolence and ferocity ſeem to turn, at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, into docility and reſpect. Every hardſhip he endures, every ſtep he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, in his wide and laborious career of Beneficence, inſtead of impairing his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0332001500:23"/>
ſtrength, invigorates his frame; inſtead of diminiſhing his influence, increaſes the utility of his conduct, by making the world acquainted with the ſanctity of his character. Witneſs, ye various regions of the earth! with what ſurprize, delight, and veneration, ye beheld an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and unaſſuming traveller inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in the ſublime ſcience of miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating human miſery, and giving you a matchleſs example of tenderneſs and magnanimity! O, England! thou ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous country! ever enamoured of glory, contemplate in this, the moſt perfect of thy illuſtrious ſons; contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate thoſe virtues, and that honour, in which thy parental ſpirit may moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily exult!—What ſpectacle can be more flattering to thy native, thy honeſt pride, than to behold the proudeſt potentates
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0332001500:24"/>
of diſtant nations liſtening with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to a private Engliſhman; and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from his reſearches, how to relieve the moſt injured of their ſubjects! how to aboliſh the enormities of perverted Juſtice! To form a complete account of the good ariſing to the world from the life and labours of HOWARD, would be a taſk beyond the limits of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind: an exact ſtatement of the benefits he has conferred upon ſociety, could be rendered only by the attendant Spirit whom Providence commiſſioned to watch over him, and who might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, by the powers of ſupernatural vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what pregnant ſources of public calamity he cruſhed in the ſeed, and what future virtues, in various indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, he may draw into the ſervice of mankind by the attraction of his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0332001500:25"/>
Of good, more immediately viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which his exertions produced, there is abundant evidence in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the wide circle of his foreign excurſion, what nation, what city, does not bear ſome conſpicuous traces of his intrepid and indefatigable beneficence! Of the aſtoniſhing length to which his zeal and perſeverance extended, we have the moſt ingenuous and ſatisfactory nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in thoſe ſingularly meritorious volumes which he has given to the world. In theſe we behold the minute detail of labours to which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſimilar, or ſecond, in the hiſtory of public virtue; and for which there could be no adequate reward but in the beatitude of Heaven. An eloquent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt, whoſe genius was nearly allied to frenzy, has expreſſed a deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0332001500:26"/>
himſelf before the tribunal of the Almighty Judge, with a volume in his hand, in which he had recorded his own thoughts and actions: if ſuch an idea could be ſuitable to the littleneſs of man, if it could become any mortal of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo limited to make ſuch an offering to the great Fountain of all intelligence, that mortal muſt aſſuredly be HOWARD: for where could we find another indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, not profeſſedly inſpired, who might preſent to his Maker a record of labours ſo eminently directed by Piety and Virtue! a book, addreſſed to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without inſulting their weakneſs, or flattering their paſſions! a book, whoſe great object was to benefit the world, without ſeeking from it any kind of reward! a book, in which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine modeſty of the Writer is equal to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0332001500:27"/>
his unexampled beneficence! The mind of HOWARD was ſingularly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely free from the common and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſion for applauſe: that paſſion which, though taken altogether, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beneficial to the intereſts of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet frequently communicates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude and unſteadineſs to the purſuits of Genius and Virtue. As human praiſe was never the object of his ambition, ſo he has nobly ſoared above it. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in different ages upon the Earth, certain elevated ſpirits, who, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of their conceptions, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of their conduct, attain a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory which can never be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the keeneſt followers of Fame.— They ſeek not panegyricks; and pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks can add nothing to their honour. The Eulogies have periſhed which were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0332001500:28"/>
devoted by the luxuriant genius of Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by the laconic ſpirit of Brutus, to the public virtue of CATO; yet the name of that illuſtrious Roman is ſtill power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the world, and excites in every cultivated mind, an animating idea of independent integrity. The name of HOWARD has ſuperior force, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier effect. It is a ſound, at which the ſtrings of humanity will vibrate with exultation in many millions of hearts. Through the various nations that he viſited, the mere echo of his name will be ſufficient to awaken that nobleſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which at once ſoftens and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſoul. Every warm-hearted and worthy individual who mentions HOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARD will glow with an honeſt, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſatisfaction, in feeling himſelf the fellow-creature of ſuch a man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0332001500:29"/>
the elegant arts are eſtabliſhed, they will contend in raiſing memorials to his honour. Indeed, the globe itſelf may be conſidered as his Mauſoleum; and the inhabitants of every priſon it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as groups of living ſtatues that commemorate his virtue. There is no claſs of mankind by whom his memory ought not to be cheriſhed, becauſe all are intereſted in thoſe evils (ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſociety! ſo dangerous to life!) which he was ever labouring to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen or exterminate. It might be wiſhed, that different communities ſhould ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deviſe ſome different tribute of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to him whoſe character and conduct is ſo intereſting to all: not for the ſake of multiplying vain and uſeleſs offerings to the dead, but to impreſs with more energy and extent his ennobling remembrance on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0332001500:30"/>
the heart and ſoul of the living. It is hardly poſſible to preſent too frequently to the human mind the image of a man who lived only to do good. I mean not merely ſuch a reſemblance of his form as Art may execute with materials al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as periſhable as the image of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man clay, but ſuch an impreſſion of his ſoul as may have a more laſting influence on the life and conduct of his admirers, ſuch as, diffuſing among them a portion of his ſpirit, may in ſome meaſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>"By this community, I am confident, ſuch public honours will be paid to HOWARD, as may be moſt ſuitable to the peculiar intereſt which it becomes us to take in his glory. What theſe honours ſhall be is a point to be ſettled by this liberal and enlightened Aſſembly,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0332001500:31"/>
which aſſuredly will not fail to remember that he ſuggeſted to Legal Authority her omiſſions and defects with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and endearing tenderneſs of a Friend; that he laboured in the ſervice of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with that intelligence, fortitude, and zeal, which her votaries cannot too warmly admire, or too gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge."</p>
            <p>The Preſident aroſe as he thus ended his ſpeech; and the members of the Aſſembly ſeemed beginning to confer among themſelves; but what debates enſued, or what meaſure was adopted, I am unable to tell, as my viſionary Guides immediately hurried me to the adjoining Temple.</p>
            <p>This ſecond ſtructure, though leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and leſs ſolid that the firſt, was more attractive to the eye, as it abounded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0332001500:32"/>
with ſcientifical and diverſified decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Aſſembly conſiſted of men, who appeared to me equally remarkable for keenneſs of intellect and elegance of manners. The ſeat of pre eminence among them was filled by a perſon who poſſeſſed in a very uncommon degree theſe two valuable qualities, ſo happily conducive to medical utility and medical diſtinction. Though left a young orphan, without patrimony, and obliged to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with early diſadvantages, he raiſed himſelf by meritorious exertion to the head of a profeſſion in which opulence is generally the juſt attendant on know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and reputation. But neither opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor his long intercourſe with ſickneſs and death, have hardened the native tenderneſs of his heart; and I had lately known him ſhed tears of regret
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0332001500:33"/>
on the untimely fate of an amiable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, whom his conſummate ſkill and attention were unable to ſave.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I was delighted to obſerve that he was preparing to addreſs the Aſſembly in the moment we entered. My celeſtial Guides ſmiled on each other in perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſatisfaction; and being placed by them inſtantaneouſly in a commodious ſituation, I heard the following diſcourſe, which the character I have deſcribed delivered with an eaſe and refined acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs peculiar to himſelf, never raiſing his voice above the pitch of polite and ſpirited converſation:</p>
            <p>"I am perſuaded, that every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual to whom I have now the happineſs of ſpeaking, will readily agree with me in this ſentiment, that we cannot poſſibly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0332001500:34"/>
do ourſelves more honour as a Fraternity than by conſidering HOWARD as an Aſſociate: aſſuredly, there is no claſs of men who may more juſtly preſume to cheriſh his name and character with a fraternal affection. In proportion as we are accuſtomed to contemplate, to pity, and to counteract, the ſufferings of Nature, the more are we enabled and inclined to eſtimate, to love, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, a being ſo compaſſionate and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent. If Phyſicians are, what I once heard them called by a lively friend, the Soldiers of Humanity, engaged in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and too often, alas! unſucceſsful conflict againſt the enemies of life; HOWARD is not only entitled to high rank in our corps, but he is the very Caeſar of this hard, this perilous, and, let me add, this moſt honourable war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0332001500:35"/>
Perhaps the ambition of the great Roman Commander, inſatiate and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary as it was, did not contribute more to the torment and deſtruction of the human race, than the charity of the Engliſh Philanthropiſt has contributed to its relief and preſervation. Of this we are very certain, the ſplendid and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Hero of Slaughter and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory did not traverſe a more extenſive field, nor expoſe himſelf more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly to perſonal danger, than our meek and unoſtentatious Hero of Medical Benevolence. In point of true magnanimity, I apprehend the ſpirit of Caeſar would very willingly confeſs, that his own celebrated attempts to reduce Gaul and Britain were low and little atchievements, when compared to the unexampled efforts by which HOWARD
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0332001500:36"/>
endeavoured to exterminate or ſubdue (thoſe enemies more terrific) the Gaol Fever, and the Plague.</p>
            <p>"But leaving it to more able and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent panegyriſts to celebrate the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginality, the boldneſs, and all the various merit of his philanthropic exertions, I ſhall confine myſelf to a few remarks, and chiefly profeſſional ones, on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable character. It appears to me highly worthy of obſervation, that HOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARD, before he entered on his grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Public Benevolence, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thoſe little, but depreſſive varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of health which have betrayed many a valetudinarian into habits of inaction and inutility. Happily for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for mankind, this excellent perſon ſurmounted a conſtitutional bias to indolence and retirement. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0332001500:37"/>
was, he became a ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of activity and vigour. His powers, and enjoyments of bodily and mental health, augmented in proportion to the extenſive utility of his purſuits.</p>
            <p>"Beneficial as his life has been to the world, his memory may be ſtill more ſo. It may prove a perpetual bleſſing to mankind, if it diſſipates, as it ought to do, a weak and common prejudice, which often operates as a palſy upon the firſt idea of a great and generous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. The prejudice I mean is a haſty perſuaſion, frequently found in the moſt amiable minds, that ſome peculiar ſtrength of nerve, ſome rare mechaniſm of frame, and extraordinary aſſemblage of mental powers, are abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the execution of any noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. How greatly does it redound to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0332001500:38"/>
the true glory of HOWARD to have given in his ſucceſsful labours the fulleſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a prejudice, ſo inimical to the intereſt and the honour of human-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! a prejudice, by whoſe influence, to uſe the words of our great Poet,
<q>
                  <l>— The native hue of Reſolution</l>
                  <l>Is ſicklied o'er with the pale caſt of Fear,</l>
                  <l>And enterprizes of great pith and moment,</l>
                  <l>With this regard, their currents turn awry</l>
                  <l>And loſe the name of action.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>"The life and character of HOWARD, if they are juſtly conſidered, may not only annihilate this pernicious prejudice, but tend to eſtabliſh an oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory truth. His example may ſhew us, that ſome degrees of bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mental depreſſion may be moſt happily cured by active exertion in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0332001500:39"/>
ſervice of mankind. Perhaps there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exiſted a more ſtriking proof how far a noble impulſe, communicated to the mind by a project of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Benevolence, may invigorate a frame not equal in health, ſtrength, and ſtature, to the common ſtandard of men. It is a prudential maxim of the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Raleigh, that "Whoſoever will live altogether out of himſelf, and ſtudy other men's humours, ſhall never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;" a maxim, which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of HOWARD might almoſt teach us to convert into a medical aphoriſm, by ſaying, "Whoſoever will live alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of himſelf, and conſult other men's wants, and calamities, ſhall never be unhealthy." It is delightful to thoſe, who deteſt the debaſing tenets of a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh philoſophy, to ſee the happy influence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0332001500:40"/>
of oppoſite ideas; to obſerve (what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have frequent opportunities of obſerving), that as a ſelfiſh turn of mind often attracts and encreaſes the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſickneſs, ſo an unſelfiſh, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate ſpirit has a natural tendency to eſcape or ſubdue it. What can be more pleaſing to thoſe, who aſſert and eſteem the dignity of human-nature, than to ſee, that the having loſt all thoughts of ſelf, and having acted in direct oppoſition to ſelfiſh principles, has promoted even the perſonal advantage of a generous individual? From ſuch a ſeries of philanthropic labour and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, as a ſelfiſh and timid mind might eſteem it frenzy to encounter, HOWARD derived not only his unrivalled and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal reputation, but the perfect reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of enfeebled health; not to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0332001500:41"/>
mention thoſe high gratifications of the heart and conſcience, which are ſuperior to all the enjoyments both of health and glory. With ſuch temperance in diet, that his daily food would appear to moſt people not ſufficient to ſupport the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon functions of life, he chearfully ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the hardſhips of long travel, through regions where travelling is moſt difficult and dangerous. With a figure, voice, and deportment, that ſeemed to preclude him from all perſonal influence and authority; and with no mental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, except thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every cultivated mind, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to himſelf not only univerſal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, but, I may venture to ſay, the juſt and moral idolatry of the world. So invigorating are projects of extenſive Beneficence! ſo powerful is the energy of Public Virtue!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0332001500:42"/>"Never, indeed, was the aſtoniſhing influence of plain and ſimple goodneſs more ſtrikingly diſplayed, than in the deference and reſpect which this private and meek individual received, not only from foreign and imperious Rulers of the Earth, but from hardened and atrocious wretches, on whom Juſtice herſelf could hardly make any mental impreſſion, though armed with all the ſplendour, and all the violence of power. Two particular examples of the influence I am ſpeaking of, I ſhall mention here, not only as honourable to the prime object of our regard, but as they may ſuggeſt to contemplative minds ſome uſeful ideas, by ſhewing how far the mere weight of an upright and benevolent character alone may give to the moſt callous nerves a trembling ſenſibility, and awaken the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0332001500:43"/>
moſt ferocious ſpirit to ſelf-correction.</p>
            <p>"When our indefatigable Viſitor of priſons was in Ruſſia, he beheld, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, the puniſhment of the knoot ſeverely adminiſtered by a ſtrong and ſtern execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</p>
            <p>"On the following day he waited on this man, to requeſt from him various information. The executioner attended him obſequiouſly; but this athletic ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, though trained to acts of cruelty, and conſcious he had a legal ſanction for the barbarous violence he had exerted, could not behold without ſhuddering the meek and gentle Miſſionary of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
            <p>"The ſecond and more memorable example of his ſingular influence occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a priſon of his own country, and relates to an outrageous female delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0332001500:44"/>
A corrupt and ferocious woman is, perhaps, the moſt intractable fiend that human benevolence can attempt to reform; but even this difficulty the mild and and powerful character of HOWARD accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>"In one of our Weſtern gaols, he found an unhappy female loaded with heavy irons: on his appearance ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to obtain for her the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of theſe galling fetters. Upon enquiry, he found that many endeavours had been made to keep this turbulent offender in proper ſubjection without the ſeverity of chains; but, after repeated promiſes of amendment on milder treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe had obliged the keeper to have recourſe to this extreme by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into the moſt flagrant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable contempt of decency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0332001500:45"/>
Upon this information, HOWARD ſaid mildly to the unhappy criminal, "I wiſh to relieve you, but you put it out of my power; for I ſhould loſe all the little credit I have, if I exerted it for offenders ſo hardened and ſo turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent." "I know," replied the intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delinquent, "I know that I have a proud and rebellious ſpirit; but if I give a promiſe to ſo good a man as you are, I can and I will command it." On this firm aſſurance of reformation, the benevolent HOWARD became a kind of furety for her future peaceable conduct on the removal of her irons; and he had the inexpreſſible delight to find, on his next viſit to the priſoners of this gaol, that the outrageous and ungovernable culprit, for whom he had ventured to anſwer, was become the moſt orderly among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0332001500:46"/>"I could wiſh, for the moral intereſt of mankind, that it were poſſible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a minute account of the ſervices rendered to the calamitous ſpirit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a forſaken individual by the ſingular charity of HOWARD. What could be more inſtructive than to obſerve how his Beneficence encreaſed by its exertion and ſucceſs; while his deſire of befriending the wretched became, as it were, the vital ſpirit that gave ſtrength and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his own exiſtence!</p>
            <p>"If we contemplate with pleaſure the ſingular re-eſtabliſhment of bodily health, which HOWARD derived from his active philanthropy; it may be ſtill more pleaſing to recollect, that it alſo afforded him an efficacious medicine for an afflicted mind. Perhaps it was to ſhew the full efficacy of this virtue in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0332001500:47"/>
all its luſtre, that Heaven allotted to this excellent perſonage a domeſtic calamity, which appears (to borrow an expreſſion from a great writer) 'of an unconſcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſize to human ſtrength.'</p>
            <p>"That capricious and deteſtable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Detraction, which on Earth never fails to perſecute ſuperior Virtue, has not ſcrupled to aſſert that the affliction, to which I allude, was the mere conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of paternal auſterity. The Earth itſelf, though frequently accuſed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eager to receive ideas that may a baſe the eminent, could hardly admit a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny ſo groundleſs and irrational. In this purer ſpot it is utterly needleſs to prove the innocence of an exalted being, to whom we are only ſolicitous to pay that ſincere tribute of praiſe and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which we are conſcious he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.

In truth, this admirable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſeemed to illuſtrate the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical maxim, that mildneſs is the proper companion of true magnanimity. He had a gentleneſs of manners, that was peculiar to himſelf; and, inſtead of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſuch imperious ſeverity of ſpirit as might produce the calamity I allude to, he was really endued with ſuch native tenderneſs of heart as muſt have ſunk under it, had he not found in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled ſervices that he rendered to the world, an antidote to the poiſon of domeſtic infelicity. It is among the moſt gracious ordinances of Providence, that man is ſure to find the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful relief for his own particular afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in his endeavours to alleviate the ſufferings of others. And permit me to add, it is this beneficent law of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0332001500:49"/>
that gives a peculiar charm and dignity to the Medical Profeſſion; a profeſſion ſingularly endeared to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate HOWARD! not only as its compaſſionate and active ſpirit was the guide of his purſuits, but as one of its prime ornaments was his favourite aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate and his boſom-friend. If different claſſes of men are to vie with each other, as it may certainly become them to do, in rendering various honours to this their matchleſs Benefactor; I hope we ſhall diſplay, with the moſt affectionate ſpirit, the deep intereſt that we ought to take in his glory. I think it very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable that every Phyſician ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a Medal of HOWARD, not only to ſhew his veneration for the great Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſt, but to derive perſonal advantage from ſuch a mental Amulet, if I may

Moſt of us, in the exerciſe of Medicine, feel at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar moments that our ſpirits are too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affected by the objects we ſurvey; that ſcenes of miſery and infection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and alarm: at ſuch a time how might it rekindle the energy of our minds to contemplate a little effigy of HOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARD! to recollect, that all the trouble and danger that we encounter, in the practice of a lucrative profeſſion, are trifling in the extreme, when compared to the labour and the peril, which this wonderful man moſt willingly took upon himſelf, without looking forward to any reward but the approbation of Heaven!</p>
            <p>"I mention not a Medal as a new idea—it has been already in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a motto for it ſuggeſted, which applies with ſuch ſingular force and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety

            <p>"I muſt confeſs, however, that I wiſh for another, which may ſeem to bind him more cloſely to us in a medical point of view. But it is time to leave the different members of our Fraternity at full liberty to propoſe any marks of diſtinction that they wiſh to ſuggeſt.— It is ſufficient for me to have reminded you of a truth, which I am confident we all equally feel, that, while we juſtly conſider ourſelves as ſtudents in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive

            <p>On the concluſion of this diſcourſe, my Guides immediately conducted me, with their former celerity and kindneſs, to the only remaining Structure. It was the moſt extenſive, and, from the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed majeſty of its appearance, the moſt admirable of the three. In ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching it, I pauſed a moment in awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſurpriſe at the ſolemnity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick: the moſt lovely and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my two aetherial conductors ſmiled upon me, and ſaid, "You will find here Miniſters of GOD from every Chriſtian country; but only thoſe who conſider Evangelical Charity as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0332001500:53"/>
of true Religion, and who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to honour, in the favourite object of your veneration, the moſt ſignal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that virtue, which the preſent age has beheld." "I hope then," I eagerly replied, "I ſhall have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of hearing, on this occaſion, the moſt eloquent of our Engliſh Biſhops." On this exclamation, my kind informer regarded me with that lively and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air with which intelligent Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence corrects miſtaken ſimplicity, and thus continued to inſtruct me with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vivacity and tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>"Earthly diſtinctions, you know, are of little moment in the ſight of Heaven. You will hear no Prelate; and perhaps you may feel ſurpriſed and indignant, when you obſerve how very few of your Mitred Countrymen are to be ſeen in this

Aſſembly; but you will not retain in this hallowed ſpot that moſt common of human infirmities, a tendency to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or to ſuſpicion. You will recollect that this Convocation contains only thoſe charitable men, who are peculiarly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to honour your recent model of this Chriſtian virtue. Other good men may exiſt, who, from motives of innocent miſtake, or of mere inadvertency, may fail to exhibit that animated regard to his exemplary character, which aſſuredly it has merited from all men, and which the Miniſters of Religion may moſt properly diſplay.</p>
            <p>"One of theſe," continued my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, "you are now going to hear; not, indeed, a Dignitary of your Church, yet a Divine of Talents, Learning, and Charity. He was led, by a laudable

warmth of heart, to ſuggeſt to your Country the firſt idea of paying a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic tribute of veneration to the ſignal virtue of HOWARD; and has acquired from this circumſtance a title to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate here the merit, to which he was eager to render ſuch early juſtice on earth. But it is time for us to attend him."</p>
            <p>We immediately entered the temple; and I beheld an Eccleſiaſtic riſing at that moment to addreſs a very numerous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of his order, that ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chriſtians of every ſect, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of every degree.

                        <p>IN theſe few words, my brethren, we have a paſſage of Scripture, that ſerved as a favourite maxim, or leading truth, to the admirable perſonage whoſe glorious qualities it is now both my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and my delight to recall to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The words, indeed, are ſo conſonant to that exalted ſpirit which his life diſplayed, that they almoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me an epitome of his character. Let us conſider Courage as one of his principal endowments! To contemplate
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0332001500:57"/>
ſo pure and reſolute a being in this point of view, may lead us to form juſt ideas on the true nature of this primary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, on the ſacred ſource from whence it ſhould proceed, and the ſublime end to which it ſhould aſpire. How large a portion of folly, vice, and wickedneſs, have ariſen from mere miſtakes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this moſt important of human quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! ſo important, that the real dignity of man can only riſe in proportion as this virtue is perfectly underſtood, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly cheriſhed! In the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let me add, our courageous Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſt will be found entitled to the praiſe of every upright mind, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of every feeling heart.</p>
                        <p>If we take the word Courage, in the moſt common and ſimple ſenſe of that term, as a generous and noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0332001500:58"/>
of perſonal hardſhip and danger; who has given more numerous or more ſtriking examples of ſuch brave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt! Or if we follow the definition of Courage given us by a profound, an eloquent, and philanthropic Writer, namely, that it is a juſt eſtimate of our own powers; who is there among the moſt ſignal Benefactors of mankind, not profeſſedly inſpired, that ever formed an eſtimate of what he might atchieve in the moſt glorious field of enterprize, at once ſo difficult, and ſo true, ſo humble, and ſo grand.</p>
                        <p>With every apparent diſadvantage, HOWARD conceived it poſſible that his endeavours might correct the abuſes, and mitigate the ſufferings of men, in various nations of the world. Whence happened it, that a mortal, ſo viſibly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0332001500:59"/>
weak and gentle, ſhrunk not from an idea ſo pregnant with difficulty and peril! It was becauſe, "The Righteous are bold as a Lion." It was becauſe he felt the ſtrongeſt internal conviction of this animating truth, that, while Heaven bleſſes a man with health ſufficient to purſue a benevolent and magnanimous deſign, the vigour of his mind, and moſt probably his powers of doing good, will be proportioned to the firmneſs of his faith, and the ſincerity of his virtue.</p>
                        <p>Many atchievements of beneficent Courage have undoubtedly been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by men influenced by no motive but that generous love of glory which is ſo frequently the predominant paſſion of an active and ardent mind: but the virtues that ariſe from this ſource are as unſteady, and as precarious, as the reward
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0332001500:60"/>
they purſue. He who acts only as a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for the applauſe of mankind, will find his ſpirit vary with all the variations in the ever-changing atmoſphere of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinion. He will be ſubject to hot and cold fits of action and inactivity, of confidence and diſtruſt, in proportion as the illuſive vapour, that he follows, may either ſparkle or fade before him. Hence proceeded much of that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and weakneſs, which appear in ſome of the moſt enlightened and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed characters of the Pagan world.— Wanting a purer light from Heaven, the moſt radiant ſpirits of antiquity were bewildered; one in particular, the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt undaunted of antient Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, who had a ſufficient portion of heroic philanthropy to prefer the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of mankind to every ſelfiſh conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0332001500:61"/>
had yet his hours of diffidence and deſpondency. On a final review of his own generous labours, he is ſuppoſed to have queſtioned the very exiſtence of Virtue, though he had made it the idol of his life; a ſtriking proof, that the temperate and invariable energy of ſoul, which alone perhaps deſerves the name of true Courage, can only proceed from a fuller knowledge and love of GOD; from the animating aſſurance, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may proſper or fail in the earthly ſucceſs of our endeavours to do good, the merit of the attempt is regiſtered in Heaven; and we ſecure to ourſelves the everlaſting approbation of our Almighty Parent, in proportion as we approach towards that bleſſed model of Perfect Benevolence, who has taught us, by his divine example, to compaſſionate and to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0332001500:62"/>
relieve the ſufferings of the wretched. From this ſource flowed the courageous beneficence of HOWARD: and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful it is to obſerve that the force, the extent, the utility, and the luſtre of the ſtream, has gloriouſly correſponded to the height and purity of the fountain!</p>
                        <p>The Senſualiſt and the Sceptic may, indeed, deride the conduct of a man, who ſacrificed all the common pleaſures of life, and ſought for no recompence but in the favour of Heaven. It may be ſaid that an illuſive fervor of mind has hurried men, in all periods of the world, into ſingular and wild exertions, which excite the wonder of the paſſing hour, and are afterwards either deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten, or only recalled to notice by Reaſon and Philoſophy, to caution the reſtleſs and impetuous ſpirit of man againſt all ſimilar exceſſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0332001500:63"/>But the purſuits of HOWARD, though they had all that ſublime energy which ſo often diſtinguiſhed the projects of Superſtition, were ſo far from being influenced by any ſuperſtitious propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that perhaps they cannot appear to more advantage than by being brought into compariſon, or contraſt, not with the ſluggiſh piety of ſequeſtered Monks, but with the bold and ſplendid feats of the molt active and enterpriſing Fanaticiſm. Allow me, therefore, to recall to your thoughts thoſe diſtant ages, when every ardent ſpirit in Chriſtendom was inflamed with a paſſionate deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Chriſtian pilgrims of Paleſtine from the oppreſſion of Infidels! Figure to yourſelves the whole force of Europe collecting its violence, like a troubled ſea, and preparing to pour a terrific and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0332001500:64"/>
deſtructive inundation over the Holy Land! Behold the ſtrong and the weak, the ambitious and the humble, purſuing the ſame object! Behold aſſembled Kings and their People, Soldiers and Prieſts, the ſervants of Earth and Heaven ruſhing, with equal ardour, to reſcue the Sepulchre of CHRIST, and to drown all the innumerable enemies of their Faith in an univerſal deluge of blood! In this ſcene we have the ſublimeſt ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, perhaps, that was ever exhibited by miſtaken piety and miſguided valour. The love of GOD, by which this heroic multitude was profeſſedly impelled, was probably in many minds as ſincere as it was ardent. The religious ſpirit of their enterprize can ſtill animate and tranſport us in the ſong of the Poet: and in the more rational page of Hiſtory, while we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0332001500:65"/>
juſtly lament the errors of their devotion, we admire the force and perſeverance of their courage.</p>
                        <p>To the ſublime fortitude of theſe collected warriors, let us compare the mild magnanimity of HOWARD. Let us ſurvey him ſetting forth for an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as perilous as theirs; not as the Soldier of Fanaticiſm, but as the Pilgrim of Humanity! Attachment to GOD, and reſolution which no hardſhip, no danger, no difficulty can daunt, are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the ſanguinary Fanatic and the compaſſionate Philanthropiſt: but how widely different are the prime earthly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their purſuits! The fierce Cruſaders invaded Aſia with a deſire to exterminate the Infidels. The benevolent HOWARD was led into the ſame quarter of the globe, and into perils more deadly than thoſe of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0332001500:66"/>
war, by a wiſh to exterminate, or rather to reſtrain, the ravages of that terrific enemy to human life, the Plague.</p>
                        <p>He had conceived an idea, that, as this moſt alarming of mortal maladies has been often ſtrangely neglected by the ſluggiſh and ſuperſtitious inhabitants of the Eaſt, it might be poſſible by a calm and courageous examination of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and its progreſs, to ſet limits to its rage; and particularly to ſecure his own country from a future viſitation of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, againſt which the fearleſs and eager ſpirit of Commerce appears not to have eſtabliſhed a ſufficient precaution. For the proſpect of accompliſhing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, ſo devoutly to be wiſhed, he nobly thought it a trifling ſacrifice to hazard the little remnant of his advanced life; and, however men or nations may
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0332001500:67"/>
differ in policy or religion, wherever there is a human ſpirit ſufficiently pure and enlightened to eſtimate public virtue, the ſentiments and the conduct of HOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARD muſt ſecure to his memory the fondeſt veneration. There is a perfection and felicity in his character that appears ſupremely laudable in every point of view. If, abſtracted from all religious conſiderations, we regard him only as a citizen who devoted himſelf to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country, the brighteſt records of Antiquity afford us no parallel to his merit. Had he lived in thoſe early times, the generous enthuſiaſm of the antient world would have idolized his name. Philoſophy and Genius would have found, in his benevolent labours, the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple theme for inſtruction, and the pureſt ſubject for univerſal pahegyrick. They
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0332001500:68"/>
would have celebrated him as a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to mankind, who had built a new portico to the Temple of Glory ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the dome itſelf, They would have preferred the beneficent Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſt to the dazzling Conqueror, to the faſcinating Demagogue, to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Sophiſt; and all the various idols of public praiſe. But as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity exhibits no character of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded luſtre, we have great reaſon to conclude, that ſuch a character could owe its exiſtence only to the pure and ſublime ſpirit of our Chriſtian Faith. Let us, therefore, contemplate HOWARD as a Chriſtian! it is by conſidering him in this light, that we ſhall feel ourſelves moſt happily related to his virtues, and moſt delightfully intereſted in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours they receive.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0332001500:69"/>In the poor and calamitous objects of his regard, in the gentleneſs and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his manners, in his modeſt and magnanimous refuſal of earthly honours, in the wide extent and courageous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of his charity, we cannot fail to diſcern how richly he was endowed with the genuine ſpirit of that pure and ſublime Religion which has the divine prerogative of converting weakneſs into ſtrength, and of giving to Humility the influence of Power. There is not a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the character, there is hardly an action in the life of this exemplary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, that does not mark him as a true ſervant of CHRIST. And may we not preſume the bleſſed Author of our faith, in ſupplying us in theſe diſſolute times with a recent example of ſuch aſtoniſhing and unlimited beneficence, is graciouſly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0332001500:70"/>
pleaſed to afford us a new motive to prize and to cheriſh that animating faith, which could form, in an age like the preſent, a character ſo wonderfully entitled to the veneration of the world? The ſpirit of Chriſtianity is ſo viſible in the conduct of HOWARD, that the prime objects of his attention might be thought to have been ſuggeſted to him by the very words in which our bleſſed Lord announces to the heirs of eternal glory the ſource of their beatitude—"Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me; I was in priſon, and ye came unto me."</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0332001500:71"/>Is it poſſible for us, my Brethren, to recall to our memory theſe holy words without feeling at the ſame time, in the moſt forcible degree, all the Chriſtian merits of HOWARD? Can we fail to admire and to venerate the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled ardour, purity, and perſeverance, with which he exerciſed the peculiar virtue ſo diſtinguiſhed by our Lord?— While we behold him ſublimely pre-eminent in this Chriſtian perfection, ſhall we not cheriſh the delightful idea, that his heavenly rewards will be finally ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to his unrivaled labours on earth? Shall not thoſe who have loved him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult in the perſuaſion, that in that great and aweful day, when the living and the dead are to receive their everlaſting doom; when the princes and the great ones of the earth may be confronted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0332001500:72"/>
with thoſe whom they have perſecuted and oppreſſed, or whom they have failed to relieve; when the proudeſt Sons of Learning, Genius, or Wit, may ſhrink at the ſuperior luſtre of thoſe whom they have ridiculed and reviled; HOWARD will ſhine encircled by thouſands, who will gratefully plead for his beatitude in thoſe bleſſed words of our Redeemer, "I was in priſon, and he came unto me!"</p>
                        <p>Yes, my Brethren, the day will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly come, when the ſervant ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally faithful will be called to a reward, ſurpaſſing the utmoſt reach of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, by the voice of his Righteous Maſter—then, and then only, will praiſe be fully proportioned to his tranſcendant merit; when this conſummate Chriſtian is raiſed to glory by the glorified Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, when his pure ſpirit exults in the commendation of his GOD.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0332001500:73"/>The imperfect efforts, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind may make to do honour to ſuch a Being, cannot, indeed, ſo much promote his glory, as they may conduce to the intereſt of human nature. Subject as it has been to the wildeſt exceſſes, human panegyric, in all its ſhapes, may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to a perſonage, whom it is hardly poſſible to praiſe with ſincerity, without feeling our diſpoſition improved. In a beneficent, a ſublime, and truly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious character, there is a ſort of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic virtue, which to thoſe who are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately drawn towards it, though only in idea, communicates a portion of itſelf. Hence ariſes, what we cannot too fondly cheriſh, the delight and the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of commemorating departed worth. If its title to commemoration be juſtly proportioned to its magnitude, its ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0332001500:74"/>
and extent; not only various indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, but different Nations, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rivals in promoting the fame of HOWARD. As the glorious qualities, which his life diſplayed, are equally open to the emulation of the great and the humble; every claſs of human creatures is peculiarly intereſted in his praiſe. If to honour his memory may be thought to belong to any one community more than to another; ſurely, my Brethren, we ſhall not fail to aſſume to ourſelves ſo pleaſing a duty, ſo honourable a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. Well, indeed, might the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting enemies of our Faith reproach us with a ſupine and diſgraceful inattention to the real intereſt of Virtue, and the true glory of Religion, could we ſuffer any other order of men to ſurpaſs the Miniſters of CHRIST in a meritorious
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0332001500:75"/>
zeal to honour this faithful ſervant of Heaven, whoſe life exhibits a leſſon more inſtructive and ſublime than all the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Pulpit! a Chriſtian, who has ſhewn us, in the moſt ſignal manner, how practicable it is to follow, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring the diſtreſt, not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but the example of our GOD.</p>

It was an open and verdant plain, with a few ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in the ground, that afforded ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous views of the whole extenſive ſpot. Here, inſtead of beholding the Miniſters of Peace, I found myſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled by the multitudinous votaries of War. It appeared to me that all the military and all the naval ſervants of our country were collected together, and each different diviſion of theſe well-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and well-looking men, that formed a pleaſing ſpectacle alone, was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0332001500:77"/>
attended by a crowd of miſcellaneous ſpectators, more numerous than itſelf: yet in all this immenſe multitude there was no ſign of tumult or confuſion. They were ranged in ſuch a manner as to form a wide circular area in the midſt of them. I was ſtationed on a little eminence within this area; and in the ſame vacant ſpace I beheld a party of veteran Commanders, both Military and Naval, who ſeemed to have been conferring together, but ſeparated by the direction of my aetherial Conductors, to addreſs, in different parts of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive field, the different companies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to their care. What they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively ſaid in their ſeparate depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I was unable to diſcover, as I only heard diſtinctly one gallant Veteran, whoſe character was particularly dear to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0332001500:78"/>
me. This conſummate officer has raiſed himſelf by merit alone from the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt rank of military life to a ſtation of the higheſt honour and truſt. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty is as ſingular as his fortune: paſſing cloſe to me, with a gracious ſalutation, he approached a very fine orderly corps of foot, who looked up to him with a ſort of filial reſpect, while he ſpoke to them the few following words:</p>
            <p>"As bravery and compaſſion are the characteriſtics of good Soldiers, you cannot want, my friends, any long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation from me to honour the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of HOWARD; the moſt reſolute and the moſt compaſſionate man that has lived in our time. Though he was not of our profeſſion, as his life was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to mitigate the united horrors of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0332001500:79"/>
captivity and ſickneſs, thoſe worſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the ſpirit of a ſoldier, you will undoubtedly feel that he has a peculiar claim to our moſt grateful and generous regard."</p>
            <p>This ſpeech was followed by a burſt of acclamation from thoſe to whom it was particularly addreſſed. Similar ſhouts of applauſe reſounded from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quarters of the ſpacious field, while our aetherial attendants, Gratitude and Admiration, who followed each ſpeaker at the cloſe of each addreſs to different diviſions of this innumerable aſſembly, diſplayed, to each diviſion in its turn, an extenſive ſketch of a ſimple but magnificent mauſoleum to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of HOWARD, in the form of an Engliſh lazaretto. On the firſt diſplay
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0332001500:80"/>
of this ſtriking and worthy monument, the applauding multitude ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult in the proſpect of its completion. But I ſoon obſerved, to my inexpreſſible concern, that while Gratitude and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were buſy in exciting the various ranks of the vaſt aſſembly, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this favourite deſign, they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by two earthy fiends of a dark and malignant influence: theſe were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Indifference, who ſhed ſuch a chill and depreſſive miſt around them, that all the ardour of the Aſſembly ſeemed to ſink. Among the miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous crowds that were viſible between the diviſions of the martial hoſt, there ran a murmur of obloquy and deriſion againſt the pure object of public ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. He was reviled as a whimſical Reformer, and a raſh Enthuſiaſt, who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0332001500:81"/>
had abſurdly ſacrificed his life in a vain and fantaſtic purſuit. This baſe ſpirit of calumnious malignity was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to any one diviſion of the martial multitude; but the univerſal zeal for the glory of HOWARD ſeemed to be almoſt annihilated; even Gratitude and Admiration appeared to grow faint in their darling purpoſe. During their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, they ſuffered their ſketch of the Mauſoleum to be gradually ſtolen from their hands, and to drop upon the ground. At this moment a ſudden and violent earthquake was felt through all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive ſcene. The centre of the vacant area opened—it threw forth a phantom terrific and enormous—its magnitude ſeemed to grow upon the ſight; its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments were ſhrouded from our view by an immenſe mantle, on which were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0332001500:82"/>
repreſented a thouſand different and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous images of Death. Its name was Contagion—it ruſhed forward with an indeſcribable movement. Diſmay and confuſion overwhelmed all that quarter of the crowded ſcene, that was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly threatened by its firſt advance. The affrighted multitude rolled back like a tumultuous ſea. The horrid ſpectre ſtopt; and left a wide interval between itſelf and the retiring hoſt. A ray of heavenly light illumined the vacant ſpace. I fixed my eye on the brilliant ſpot, and ſoon beheld the meek and gentle form of HOWARD advancing, without fear or arrogance, towards the terrific Phantom. With an untrembling hand he ſeized the dark folds of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive mantle, and ſeemed animated with the hope of annihilating the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0332001500:83"/>
In the inſtant, a burſt of celeſtial ſplendor was ſpread over the gloomy plain. The Angel of Retribution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended; and ſnatching the conſummate Philanthropiſt to his boſom, he roſe again; while all the aſtoniſhed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, now reviving from their terror, gazed only on the celeſtial apparition; and heard the reaſcending Seraph thus addreſs the beneficent ſpirit now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his care:</p>
            <p>"Thou faithful ſervant of Heaven! thy hour of recompence is come. Juſtly haſt thou cautioned mankind not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thy conduct to raſhneſs or enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. Weak and wavering in their own purſuits of felicity, thou wilt not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee them ſo in their ſenſe of thy
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0332001500:84"/>
merit, and their zeal for thy honour: but I am commiſſioned to bear thee to that All-ſeeing Power, who can alone truly eſtimates and perfectly reward thy deſert. I know that the praiſe of beings, inferior to thy GOD, never influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced thy life; but the homage of good minds is grateful to the pureſt inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Heaven; and in departing from a world ſo much indebted to thy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, let it gratify thy perfect ſpirit to foreſee, that as long as the earth endures, the moſt enlightened of her ſons will remember and revere thee as one of her ſublimeſt benefactors."</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the divine meſſenger had ceaſed to ſpeak, every voice in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated multitude, that heard him,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0332001500:85"/>
raiſed a ſhout of benediction on the name of HOWARD. I ſtarted in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port at the ſound; and the effort that I made to join the univerſal acclamation terminated my viſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0332001500:86"/>PARDON me, thou gentleſt and moſt indulgent of Friends! that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious as I am of the ſincerity with which thy pure mind ever wiſhed to avoid all exuberance of praiſe, I yet preſume to ſend into the world ſuch a tribute to thy virtues as thy humility might reject. Let the motives of the publication atone for all its defects!</p>
            <p>This little work is made public, not from a vain expectation, or deſire, in the Writer to obtain any degree of literary diſtinction; for, if his wiſhes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are ſucceſsful, the world will not know from what hand it proceeds.</p>
            <p>Thou moſt revered object of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, who art loooking down, perhaps, with compaſſion on the petty labours of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0332001500:87"/>
various mortals, now trying to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate thy merit, thou ſeeſt that I am influenced by no arrogant conceit of having praiſed with peculiar felicity the perfections that I ſo ardently admire. No! I am perfectly senſible, that the moſt worthy memorial of thy virtues will be found in thoſe pure records of thy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervices which thy own hand has given to the world with all the amiable and affecting ſimplicity that diſtinguiſhed thy character, and in the more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive compoſition of ſome accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Biographer, who may have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and ability to do juſtice to thy life.</p>
            <p>The chief aim of theſe few and haſty pages is to recall, at this particular time, to the liberal ſpirits of our countrymen that generous ardour with which they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0332001500:88"/>
embraced the firſt idea of a public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to HOWARD. While the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and dignity of that monument are yet unſettled, a Writer may conſider himſelf as a friend to national honour, who endeavours to animate his country to the moſt extenſive diſplay of her mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and her gratitude towards the pureſt public virtue. May the juſtly remember, that, to teſtify a fond mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pride in ſuch a departed ſon, to manifeſt and perpetuate eſteem for ſuch a character, is, in truth, to promote the intereſt of genuine Patriotiſm, of ſublime Morality, and of perfect Religion!</p>
