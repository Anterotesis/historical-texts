            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>No, my Love, he's no more a brother. His late acquiſition of a baronet's title, which he never expected, has rais'd him ſo much above me, that I'm now out of ſight—every ſpark of fraternal affection; even compaſſion for my ſufferings has been long extinguiſhed!</p>

                     <p>Oh, Madam, I'm out of all patience with him— his family pride, ſo provokingly unreaſonable—to take ſuch a vaſt alarm at your marrying a tradeſman, when he himſelf, tho' a baronet, is ſtill in buſineſs—your huſband was a brewer —your proud brother is a banker—and where the end is money, I can't ſee any great difference in the means us'd to acquire it.</p>

When we'd win the heart by increaſe of favours, each added obligation but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the claim of benevolence more inſupportable; and, though a kind wiſh is the only return expected, pride often quits the debt by an ungenerous endeavour to diſown it.</p>

                     <p>This morning I walk'd about here, and did n't know where to break my faſt.—If he gives me a bit of an eſtate, I'll build ſuch a country houſe! the ſign, my family arms, and my motto—walk in and eat, all that want a dinner! Ah, child! there's only one thing more you cou'd do, to make me happier—here's the neat boy, that cut and ſlaſh'd your dear Father about—that ſtood upon the deck, ſhaking the bullets out of his hair like a mermaid.—With your leave, Madam; <stage>(to Mrs. Bellevue.)</stage> Louiſa, take from my hand William Bellevue.</p>

                     <p>Thank you, Madam. But as the wind ſometimes diverts itſelf by playing in the ſails of my mill, and people will obſtinately perſiſt in this odd whim of eating bread, I think I may do pretty well as I am. Ay, we may ſee the world in our village! But a fig for the world—Let induſtry ſecure independence; and if wealth or poverty will come, let the rich man be proud only of his power to be the poor man's friend.</p>

               <l>THE World in a Village!—Lord help the ſilly man!</l>
               <l>Where could he ſtumble on ſuch an old faſhion'd plan!</l>
               <l>Here's a fine Lady for me, exhauſting her ſtore</l>
               <l>In diſcharging of debts and relieving the poor;</l>
               <l>And, inſtead among Bucks of making a racket,</l>
               <l>Falls in love with a ſwain, oh, faugh! in a jacket.</l>
               <l>The Lover too, rich, young, without one toniſh vice—</l>
               <l>No racing, no betting, no intriguing, no dice.</l>
               <l>The World in a Village!—I declare I'd as ſoon</l>
               <l>Expect natural traits from a World in the Moon.</l>
               <l>Well, if they give me ſuch parts, I'll ſo it manage,</l>
               <l>Commence an Authoreſs myſelf, and write for the Stage.</l>
               <l>The World in a Village! 'tis the World in a Town—</l>
               <l>That's your ſort, that's the go, and, 'faith, I'll write 'em down.</l>
               <l>Give to the Poor!</l>
               <l>'Tis what Ladies in high life can't afford to do,</l>
               <l>They have Dreſs, Equipage, Balls, Concerts, Pharo, Loo,</l>
               <l>Debts, Duns, and Fees for every ſecret Billet-doux.</l>
               <l>Lady Fanny Dawdle, juſt riſen from her down bed,</l>
               <l>In the hard talk of nicely blending white and red,</l>
               <l>Glancing her languid eyes from the dear glaſs a minute,</l>
               <l>Cries, "Betty, unfold that paper,—ſee what's in it".</l>
               <l>"Yes, my Lady:</l>
               <l>"It's a petition, Mem, from a poor ſoldier's wife,</l>
               <l>"Laying in of twins, Mem, juſt as he loſt his life!"—</l>

               <l>"Don't forget Lady Froth's ticket for my grand Ball."</l>
               <l>Then the men, oh, they are precious niddy noddies,</l>
               <l>With their throats tied up, falſe calves, and taper bodies:</l>
               <l>Pert men at ſeventeen, inſolvents at twenty;</l>
               <l>At twenty-five, invalids—old men at thirty.</l>

               <l>With caſh at his banker's, and ten thouſand a year,</l>
