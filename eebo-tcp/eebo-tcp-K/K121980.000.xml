         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Pages contain the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of <hi>Gilbert Langley,</hi> Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,
written by his own Pen. It
is conceived, that a liker Picture
cannot well be drawn than that which
he has given us of himſelf, it is publiſhed chiefly
for the Uſe of ſuch as may reſemble him in ſome
Reſpects. Many would fly from Vice if they ſaw
her Face all at once, and in Day Light; here ſhe is,
never was was ſhe better known to any than to this
Man, and he has ſent her abroad in her own Cloaths.
His Stile is the Stile of a Man of Pleaſure, and
was not altered, becauſe it may be of Uſe to know
what ſort of Stile that is.</p>
            <p>Some People may perhaps fancy the reading ſuch
a Life dangerous, for their Sakes this Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is prefixed. If they ſee young People make
ill Uſe of it, let them ſet them right, let them bid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0722300500:4"/>
theſe inconſiderate Folks make the Growth and
Progreſs of Vice, from abuſing Education to cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Father, to defrauding the World, from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
the World to downright Robbery, and ſo
to the Gallows; an open broad Road, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Journey makes the Stages for others, that
they ſtop or ride back in Time, according to the
old approved Maxim.

and reaſon, or rather pervert Reaſon as he
does. In ſuch a Caſe, point out a ſimilar Paſſage
in this fine Hiſtory of modern Gallantry, and put
him in Mind of the Concluſion; tell him, which
is a certain Truth, that <hi>Greenwich</hi> Rambles lead to
<hi>Maidſtone</hi> Goal, that Intrigues with Proſtitutes in
the Pleaſure rather of a Goat, than of a Man, and
that the Digreſſions from the Paths of Virtue, is

more Hazards than one of Choaking. But to
proceed to his own Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gilbert Langley,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Holdenby Langley,</hi>
an eminent <hi>Goldſmith</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and Nephew to
Sir <hi>Thomas Langley,</hi> Bart. was born <hi>Nov.</hi> 19, 1710;
at three Years of Age he was ſent down to his
Grandmother's Seat at <hi>Pelderſley</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whoſe Care he continued till he was ſeven
Years of Age, when his Mother growing impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
at his long Continuance in the Country, came
down from <hi>London</hi> to ſetch him Home. No ſooner
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0722300500:5"/>
had he received the Viſits common on ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and recovered from the Fatigue of his
Journey, but he was put to School to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>
in <hi>Red-lion-ſtreet,</hi> from whoſe prudent Inſtructions
he in his tenders Years made ſo great an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that few or none in the ſame School were
thought his Equals, and his Father unwilling to
curb the promiſing Genuis of his Child, by the
Advice and Conſent of his Maſter, removed him
from thence to the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> and thereby
gave him a further Opportunity of exerting his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Parts. Here in a ſhort Time he began to
read <hi>Virgil, Ovid, Horace,</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and
had as great Knowledge of thoſe Authors as his
tender Years would admit. But ſuch is the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Schools, that the
Maſters, either to pleaſe the Parents, or indulge
the Child, hurry their Pupils, from Claſs to Claſs
without conſulting whether they are ſufficiently
grounded in the firſt Rudiments of Learning,
Hence it is, that ſo many Youths who have ran
through all the Claſſic Authors, after a Year or
two's Abſence from School, are almoſt as far to
ſeek, as if their Parents had not expended any
Thing on their Education.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gilbert's</hi> Father being ſully perſuaded of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
univerſal Error and Corruption in our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Schools, reſolved to ſend him over to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine
Monks at <hi>Doway</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> there to have
him brought up in his own Religion; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the great Diſparity between a Foreign
and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Education, was ſo fully proved by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of Mr. <hi>Langley's</hi> Friends, yet his Wife could
not by Arguments, be induced to a Compliance in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0722300500:6"/>
parting with her Child, preferring rather the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of her Son in Ignorance, before his Abſence,
in a Place where he was ſure to have the faireſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of acquiring ſolid and uſeful Learning.
Thus her Fondneſs triumph'd over her Reaſon,
and ſhe could not bear the Thoughts of a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from her Darling, who to pleaſe her, though
to his own Prejudice, was continued at Home, till
Providence, was pleaſed to take her away, and by
that removed the ſole Obſtacle to the intended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of our young Student; for no ſooner was
his too-fond Mamma dead, and decently interred,
but the Father, earneſtly bent on his Son's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
made diligent Search for a proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to whom he might commit the Truſt of his
Son, until he ſhould arrive at <hi>Doway,</hi> the Place
deſigned for his future Education. Upon Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he found out Mr. <hi>Sturton,</hi> the Prior of the
<hi>Benedictine Monks,</hi> who being come to <hi>London</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome particular Buſineſs, was now returning
to his Convent; with this Gentleman he agreed on
an annual Sum for my Board, Learning, and all
other neceſſary Expences, and it was agreed my
Departure was to be as ſoon as poſſible. The Day
been fixed, we met at the <hi>Croſs-Keys,</hi> in <hi>Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church-Street,</hi>
where my indulgent Father, with
reiterated Entreaties, ſollicited Mr. <hi>Sturton,</hi> to a
peculiar Care of his young Pupil, and after he had
tenderly embraced me, with flowing Eyes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me to the Management of my new Tutor.
For my Part, I readily conſeſs, that being fond
of Novelty, and having a roving Diſpoſition, I
was rather pleaſed than concerned at our Parting,
and with Joy reſigned myſelf to a new ſtrange
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0722300500:7"/>
Guardian. In ſhort, we lay at the Inn that Eight,
and in the Morning took Coach for <hi>Dover,</hi> from
whence (the Packet being ready to Sail) we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
for Calais, and in a fw Hours, with a freſh
and favourable Gale, we reached the wiſhed-for
Haven. My Tutor being intimately acquainted
with Mr. <hi>Francia,</hi> (commonly known in <hi>England</hi>
by the Name of <hi>Francia</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi>) we lodged in his
Houſe, and were civilly and agreeably entertained
by him for the Space of three Days.</p>
            <p>Now all Things appear'd to me very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and being unable to underſtand the Native
Language, Manners, or Cuſtoms, I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a New World, aſking ſeveral impertinent
Queſtions of my Guardian, who well pleaſed with
my Curioſity, and juvenile Obſervations, gave me
ſuch Anſwers as my tender Age was capable to
underſtand. Now after Thanks to Mr. <hi>Francia</hi>
for his kind Entertainment, we proceeded on our
Journey, and the next Day arrived at St. <hi>Omers,</hi>
where we ſpent the whole Day viewing the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of that Town, which I ſhall not preſume to
deſcribe, being then but in the 12th Year of my
Age; yet I cannot forbear taking Notice of the
Cathedral of St. <hi>Bartin</hi>'s, an ancient and ſtately
Structure, adorned with ſeveral curious Pieces of
Painting, and embelliſhed with numerous Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but what ſtruck me moſt with Wonder
and Surprize, were the Skins of a Toad and a
Crocodile, each of an enormous Size, that were
fixed to one of the Columns of the Church; but
ſince there are ſo many various Reports, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the prodigious Dimenſions of thoſe Animals,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0722300500:8"/>
and the Manner of their being diſcovered, I ſhall
omit troubling my Reader any farther on that
Head, ſince where I cannot give a full, true, and
ſatisfactory Account, my Reſolution is to be
ſilent.</p>
            <p>Adjoining to this noble Cathedral, is a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
and ſplendid Convent, reſembling more the
Palace of a grand Monarch, than the Receptacle
of Perſons, who under the ſpacious Pretence of
Religion retire thither; although in Reality, they
much more fully iudulge their irregular Paſſions and
inordinate Deſires, than thoſe who ſtruggling in
the tempeſtuous Ocean of the World, boldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves to all Dangers, and to the utmoſt
of their Abilities, ſerve and glorify their great
Creator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this Convent are upwards of 150 Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
and near 100 Students, who all pay the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Salary of 25<hi>l.</hi> Sterling, except twelve of
them, who are upon the Pope's Foundation. My
Guardian and I paid a Viſit to the Prior, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
us in a ſumptuous and elegant Manner,
none being ſo profuſe in their Entertainments as
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy one among another. The next
Morning we ſet out for <hi>Doway,</hi> where we arrived
in the Evening, to the great Satisfaction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> who with all poſſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of Joy, received their Superior, and
(as I was afterwards informed) highly applauded
him for the due Execution of his Commiſſion, and
commended his Diligence and unwearied Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
in encreaſing the Number of the Faithful.
At the Expiration of three Days, which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
allowed to young Sparks, to initiate themſelves
in the Forms and Precepts of the College, I was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0722300500:9"/>
examined by three Reverend Fathers, and upon a
ſtrict Examination, was found capable of nothing
higher than <hi>Alvarus's</hi> Grammar, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
a plain Proof of the Vanity of ſome of
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Schools. But ſince my Readers may
be curious, and willing to be informed of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Cuſtoms of our Collegiate Life, I ſhall
for their Satisfaction give a true Account thereof.
The annual Salary is 25<hi>l.</hi> Sterling for an elder
Brother, and 20 ditto for a younger; at our firſt
Entrance we are diveſted of our ſecular Garb, and
cloathed with a Caſſock and a Gown, reſembling
in Form thoſe of the Foundation of the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi>
which Dreſs, according to the ancient
Rules of the Houſe, is allowed to each Student
new every Year. The Scholars are divided accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their different Abilities and Capacities into
ſeveral Claſſes, each apart, to prevent Noiſe and
Interruption, and over each Claſs preſides a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Maſter, whoſe Buſineſs is to inſtruct his Pupils
in the Knowledge of ſuch Authors as he thinks
moſt proper and ſuitable to their Genius and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
We were obliged to continue twelve
Months in the ſame Study, that we may be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect therein, and during that Time, have
Monthly Examinations, in which the moſt perfect
is for his Encouragement to receive a Praemium
from the Hands of the Prior, at the three ſeveral
grand Examinations, that are held before the whole
Houſe; at <hi>Eaſter, Michaelmas,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> All
(except thoſe who are in the <hi>Accidence</hi>) are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
at all Times, and on all Occaſions to ſpeak
the Latin Tongue. We have a large Dormitory,
where each Student has a Bed a-part, a Cale-facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0722300500:10"/>
and at each End thereof, a large fire Place,
though but ſmall Allowance of Wood, having but
one Faggot, and two Billets to each Fire, and that
only in the Evening, which cauſes ſome of our
young Sparks, ſometimes privately, and ſometimes
by open Force, to break into the Wood-houſe,
that ſtands in our Area or Yard. Our Refectory
or Dining-Room, is large and commodious, and
ſerved with due Oeconomy, where each Scholar
has the firſt Choice of the Portions of Meat, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Superiority in Learning. Our Diet
is Bread and Butter every Morning, at Noon half
a Pound of boil'd Meat, with a Porringer of Broth,
and at Night, the ſame Allowance of Roaſt, with
a Sallad, except on Faſts; but at Meals, we have
as much Bread and Beer as we deſire, although at
all other Times, we are debarr'd even from a cruſt
of Bread, or a Draught of Beer, which makes us
Frequently convey out the ſame under our Caſſocks,
and ſometimes like ravenous Wolves, make bold
Incurſions into the Kitchen, and there plunder and
carry away all that we can meet with; but of this
more hereafter. Over the Students, which are
never leſs than fifty or threeſcore, a Prefect is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Prior, who ought to be a Perſon of
great Sagacity and Diſcretion, for to his Care the
Direction of all the Scholars (when out of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Schools) is committed; he hears all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
ſettles all Controverſies, and appeaſes all
Quarrels that ariſe amongſt his Pupils; his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is to call them at five in the Morning, as well
in Winter as Summer, he rings the Bell to Prayers,
at their Meals ſays Grace, and orders one of the
Scholars in his Turn to mount the Pulpit, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0722300500:11"/>
read the Martyrology, during the Time of Repaſt,
whilſt he himſelf ſtands at the upper End of the
Refectory to keep Silence, and prevent any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
or Irregularities, that might otherwiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
among ſuch Boys. Hours of Study are from
Five till half an Hour after Seven, the other half
Hour being allowed for waſhing and breakfaſt
Time; at Eight we go to School, at Eleven to
Prayers, at Noon to Dinner, at One to Study, at
Two to School, at half an Hour after Four to
Play, at Five to Study, at Six to Supper, and
afterwards to play if in the Summer Time, or in
the Winter to our reſpective Seats in the Calefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
None dares preſume to go into the Town
without the Prefect's Leave; we have a capacious
Area or Yard, wherein is a Terras Walk, and a
Place very proper for the Exerciſe of Hand-Ball,
in which we ſtrove to ſurpaſs each other.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> the Scholars are allowed to chuſe
a King to promote Paſtime, and all the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of his Court; which occaſions a great deal
of Diverſion. On Twelfth Night, the King ſends
his Ambaſſadors to invite the Prior, and ſome of
the Grandees of the Houſe, to an elegant and
coſtly Supper, to which none except the great
Officers of State, are admitted; all the reſt being
then in waiting, and receive, as his Majeſty's
Bounty, what comes from his Royal Table. For
my Readers Satisfaction, I ſhall mention an odd
Accident that happened to me, whilſt I had the
Honour of ſerving in Quality of an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
            <p>On the Eve of the Epiphany, I received an Order
to take three of the Lords of the Bed-chamber, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0722300500:12"/>
go about two Miles out of Town to a Publick-houſe,
and there to purchaſe four Gallons of Brandy for the
abovementioned Entertainment. As I could ſpeak the
<hi>French</hi> Language, I ſoon executed the Commiſſion, at
a far more reaſonable Rate than I could poſſibly have
done in the Town, there being a large Duty on the
Import of any Spirituous Liquors into the Garriſon,
and that farm'd by a <hi>Comis,</hi> or Officer, that hath his
Myrmidons conſtantly attending at the Entrance of
the Town Gate, who ſearch all comers in; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſual to let the Students of different Colleges paſs
and repaſs, without Hindrance or Examination, we
thought ourſelves ſecure from any Danger that might
ariſe on that Head; ſo after our Bottles were filled,
we ſat down in the Houſe, and drank a Glaſs or two
to refreſh ourſelves; but, as ill Fortune would have
it, a Soldier coming into the ſame Houſe, privately
took Notice of our Bottles that ſtood on the Table,
and went to the Searcher's Office, and gave Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that four Students of the Benedictine Monks,
were going to convey Brandy into the Garriſon. We
were entirely ignorant of the private Information that
he had given, and therefore in a merry Mind, paid
the Reckoning, and returned homeward with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
under our Caſſocks, when, to our great Surprize,
as we were going in at the Gate, we were ſtopped,
the Brandy found upon us, and we ſecured in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
Office, till they had called a File of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
to conduct us to the head Comis's Houſe for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Examination. I had then a Piſtole in my
Pocket, and knowing the mighty Force of Gold, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to the Searchers for our Enlargement; but
they were inflexible, and therefore any one may judge,
what Horror and Confuſion we were in, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0722300500:13"/>
Danger. In ſhort, as we marched along
with the Guard of Soldiers, the Inhabitants won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
what Crime ſuch Youths could be guilty of, that
had thus expoſed them to publick Scandal and Shame.
Some pitied our Misfortune, and others condemned our
Folly, but by a lucky Accident, we met with two <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Franciſcan Fryers, who enquiring of the Serjeant the
Cauſe of this unuſal Treatment, reprimanded him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
for his Folly, in carrying us to the Officer of
the Cuſtoms, and at the ſame Time adviſed him to
conduct us to our own College, and inform the Prior
of what had happened, it being properly his Buſineſs
to anſwer for the Miſdemeanors and Trepaſſes of all
Students under his immediate Care and Direction.
This ſage Advice of the Fathers, prevailed on the
rigid Officer, who conveyed us ſafe to our own Convent
and aſterwards made his Report to the abovemention'd
Officer, who next Morning ſent to demand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Florins of the Prior, the uſual Forfeiture, or
Fine impoſed for the infringement of his Dues and
Privileges. Our Prior was ſtartled at this exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Demand, and abſolutely refuſed to give the leaſt
Satisfaction, which ſo exaſperated the Comis, that he
reſolved to proſecute us with the utmoſt Rigour.
Hereupon the Prior conſulting the Sages of the Law,
was adviſed to quiet the impending Storm, and
bring this unlucky Accident to an amicable Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was accordingly effected on the Payment
of one hundred Florins, and a further Promiſe that
none of his Pupils ſhould ever be guilty of the like
Offence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>March</hi> following, another Misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to me that had likely to have proved fatal,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0722300500:14"/>
and of greater Conſequence than the former,
which was as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Huſſey, William Etherington, George
Pigot, John Racket, William Brown, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
formed a Conſpiracy againſt the Peace of the
Common-wealth, and by a mutual and ſolemn Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were fully determined to make an Irruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kitchen, and there plunder all that we could
meet with. The Night before the Execution of our
Plot, we, by the Help of Gimblets, had ſecretly bored
two Holes in the Kitchen Door, that leads to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory,
and fixed two Pieces of Packthread, blacked
on purpoſe to prevent their being obſerved, to the
Bolts that faſtened the Door on the Inſide; this
Scheme, though artfully managed, was perceived by
one of the Scullions, who immediately gave Notice
thereof, to the reſt of the Servants, who judging our
Intent, armed themſelves with Bludgeons, and reſolv'd
to diſpute the Entrance into their ſooty Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Invaders. They likewiſe furniſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a dark Lanthorn, either to deſcry the
Number of the Aſſailants, and loudy complain againſt
ſuch publick Acts of Rapine and Hoſtility. No leſs
diligent were we to execute our Intent, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
ourſelves with luſty Cudgels, and a Chiſſel to
open the Refectory Door, between the Hours of twelve
and One, we began to attack the Garriſon; firſt with
little or no Noiſe, forced open the Door, and gained
an eaſy Entrance into the Kitchen Paſſage by the Help
of thoſe Cords we had faſtened to the Bolts of the
ſaid Door that guarded the Entrance. We now
thought ourſelves ſecure, and found in the ſaid inlett
into our intended Port, two large Barrels of Raiſins,
with the Heads of them open; this unexpected Prize
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0722300500:15"/>
overjoyed us, and we immediately fell to plunder, and
filled a large ſack that we had brought with us,
to carry away our Booty; but to our great Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we were ſuddenly ſaluted with repeated Blows
on our Heads, Backs, and Shoulders, from different
Quarters laid heavily on us, by the numerous company
of Servants, that were fully bent to retrieve their loſt
Reputation, and make us Priſoners of War. We
ſtraitway quitted our Prize, and fell Pell-mell on the
Enemy, with true <hi>Engliſh</hi> courage, and Bravery,
and returned their blows ſo briſkly, that they began
to give Ground, which ſo redoubled our Ardour, that
we drove them out of their Fortifications, into the
open Garden, belonging to the Religious; where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves unable to withſtand our Fury, they
immediately ſet up a great cry, calling out, <hi>Laroon,</hi>
               <hi>Laroon,</hi> which is in Engliſh, Thieves, Thieves, and
the <hi>Shoemaker,</hi> who was one of the Gang, ſtretching
forth his dark Lanthorn, looked ſtedfaſtly on us;
whereupon <hi>Huſſey</hi> knocked it out of his Hand, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
too late, for he already knew us, and their Out-cry
by this Time having alarmed the Houſe, we were
obliged to make a precipitate Retreat, and endeavour
to regain our Quarters before the Perfect's Arrival,
which was happily effected, and we all in our reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Beds, pretending to be faſt aſleep; but this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
would not paſs on him, for we not having Time to
Undreſs, our Caſſocks were not as uſual ſpread over
our Bed-cloaths, and he thereby eaſily diſcovered
us.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we were ſummoned before the
Grand Prior, where the poor battered and bruiſed
ſervants made a moſt pitious complaint of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Treatment, vowing that they would all leave
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0722300500:16"/>
the Houſe, except they had ample Satisfaction for the
Injury done them. The Prior taking this Affair into
his conſideration, rightly judged, that if he counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
ſnch open Acts of Theft and Hoſtility, that
none would ever ſerve in the Convent, and that it
vaſtly derogated from his character, whoſe Office was
to maintain Peace and good Tranquility throughout
his Juriſdiction, and therefore he pronounced this harſh,
tho' juſt ſentence, that we ſhould for this unparallel'd
crime, be expelled the college, as an Example to deter
others from the like notorious Offence. We were now
like criminals under Sentence of Death, none caring to
converſe with us, leaſt they ſhould be ſuſpected to be
infected with our wicked and perverſe Diſpoſitions.
However, as Mercy is ſometimes extended to the moſt
abandoned Wretches, we all (except <hi>Brown</hi>) by great
Itnereſt, and the characters our Maſters gave of our
being Youths of a promiſing Genius, were reprieved,
and once more on promiſe of our future good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
again admitted into Favour. Notwithſtanding
this unexpected clemency, we could not ſuppreſs our
Reſentment, at the Expulſion of our old confederate
<hi>Brown,</hi> but vowed to revenge the Injury and Injuſtice
that we thought was done to our former companion,
in the moſt ſecret Manner that poſſibly we could; and
therefore we had frequent Debates and conſultations
how to bring about our intended Project. At laſt,
the following Method was unanimouſly reſolved on.
In our Area ſtands the Wood-houſe, to which the
Scullion (the Informer of our firſt Attack) uſually came
every Day with a Wheelbarrow to fetch Wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Hours of four and five in the Afternoon,
for the Uſe of the Kitchen. We therefore provided
ourſelves with a cloak belonging to one of the minor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0722300500:17"/>
Students to prevent Suſpicion, ready againſt his
Entrance, to ſurprize him in the following Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>There was a Ladder ſtanding in the Yard, by
the Help of which, we privately got in at the
Window, and hid ourſelves behind the Faggots,
and there with Impatience waited his coming, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the mean Time, well provided ourſelves
with ſmart Switches, to laſh the bare Bumb of our
inveterate Enemy. No ſooner had he opened the
Door, and began to load his Barrow, but the
Cloak was thrown over his Head, and faſtened with
a Cord round his Neck, ſo that being blinded, he
was uncapable to diſcover who was the Foe, or
make any Defence to prevent his intended Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In ſhort, we firſt ſhut the Door, to prevent
his Cries being heard, then knocked him down, let
down his Breeches, and paid his bare Buttocks in
Turns, 'till we were all weary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor were his hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cries, or loud Invocations of his Tutelar
Saints, able to abate our Rage, or defend him
from the ſevere Puniſhment, that we were in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
bound to inflict on this Delinquent, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation,
and Satisfaction for the Diſgrace of our
former Companion. No ſooner was this bloody
Flagellation, or Scourging ended, but the Bell
rang to Study, and we left the poor unhappy
Wretch alone to bemoan his dire Misfortune, and
vainly vonjecture who were the Perſons who had
thus irreverently prophaned their Characters, and
went in a decent Manner to the <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> where we
took our reſpective Seats, as innocently in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as if nothing had happened, though well
pleaſed in our Conceits at the good Succeſs of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0722300500:18"/>
what we had ſo long and ſo earneſtly wiſhed for.
The Scullion had no ſooner freed himſelf from his
Hood-wink, and recovered his loſt Sight, but he
ran crying out, <hi>le Diable, le Diable,</hi> with the utmoſt
Speed into the Kitchen, and there after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his Breath, recounted the diſmal Story to
his Fellow-Servants, who were all amazed, and
ſorely affrighted leſt the ſame Devils ſhould unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
ſurprize and puniſh them for the ſaid Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
However, when the pannic Fear and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
they were in, was ſomething abated, they in a
whole Poſſe, with the injured Party at their Head,
went to the Prior, and loudly exclaimed againſt
the Inſult and barbarous Treatment of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman,
by thoſe <hi>Bougre de Chiens,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Dogs,</hi>
as they were pleaſed to call us, his Students. The
Prior calmly heard their juſt Accuſation, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
promiſed them, in <hi>Verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> to redreſs
their Grievances, and inflict condign Puniſhment
on thoſe who ſhould be ſound guilty of this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous
and unpardonable Act of Cruelty. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he came into the <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> and caſt a piercing
and obſervant Look over all the Scholars, hoping
thereby to diſcern by their Countenances, who
were the guilty Perſons; but as the moſt ſagacious
and cunning, are ſometimes deceived, ſo was he.
All his Artifices proved ineffectual, and therefore,
he with Reaſon good, as we were formerly prov'd
guilty of a Miſdemeanor, poſitively charged us
with the Fact, and called us one by one, into a
private Room, for further Examination; but we,
who were alway true to each other, abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that we either directly or indirectly, were
privy to, or knew any Thing of what we were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0722300500:19"/>
thus charged with: And I, for my Part, to clear
myſelf and Co-partners in the Crime, ſwore by the
Holy Croſs of Chriſt, that then ſtood on a Table,
in the Room, that we were no ways acceſſary, or
concerned in the Commiſſion of this horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy,
and in Confirmation thereof on bended
Knees, kiſſed and embraced the ſame. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Proteſtation had its deſired Effect, and the
Prior being thoroughly ſatisfied with this frank and
unprecedented Manner of acquitting ourſelves, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
treated us with more than uſual Marks of
his Civility and Eſteem. Nor was it ever known
during my Stay in the College, who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the abovementioned Riot,</p>
            <p>Affairs being thus happily accommodated, all
Things ſeemed to bear the chearful Air of Joy,
Peace and Tranquility, and I plyed my Studies ſo
very diligently, that for the two following Years,
I had the Honour to receive the annual Praemiums,
given for the Encouragement of the induſtrious
Student. Now the Eyes of the whole Synod
was fix'd on me, of whom they had great Hopes,
if they could by any Means or Arguments induce
me, to relinquiſh all Thoughts of a gay and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Life, and embrace a religious Monaſtical
State, and to accompliſh this their Deſign, they
treated me in a Manner different from that uſed
towards the reſt of my Contemporaries, and by
their artful and engaging Behaviour eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
me to promiſe that, with my Father's Conſent and Approbation, I would accept of the Habit,
and add one more to the Number of the Faithful.
But mark how Providence, by an unexpected and
unforeſeen Accident, ſubverted and fruſtrated wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0722300500:20"/>
they with ſo much Art had endeavoured to obtain.
As by the Benevolence, and kind Indulgence of
my Father, I was conſtantly ſupplied with Money,
I frequently went into the Town, partly for my
Recreation, and partly to improve myſelf in the
French Language, which I was very deſirous to
become Maſter of, and therefore one <hi>Thurſday</hi> in
the Afternoon, which is always a Holyday with
us, I aſked Leave of the Prefect for me and my
Companion, <hi>Roger Meynel,</hi> to go out and walk
on the Ramparts. The Prefect being vexed at
ſome Diſappointment or other, was in a ſullen
moroſe Humour, and thereſore denied our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
Exaſperated at this unexpected Denial,
we determined <hi>Nolens Volens</hi> to accompliſh our
Intent, and thus reſolved, we boldly went out at
the Convent-Gate, into the Town, and from
thence to a Tavern, where we gave a looſe to
Pleaſure and revelled at large, till we were weary
and intoxicated with Liquor, and then to ſober
ourſelves we ſtagger'd about an Hour on the
Ramparts; not unobſerved by many, and from
thence we reel'd Home, but had the Wit to ſteal
privately to Bed: When the Bell rang to Supper,
we being miſſing, were enquired for; however,
Anſwer was made by ſome of our Friends, that
we were taken ill and gone to Bed. This Excuſe
paſs'd for two or three Days, till a Gentleman who
knew us, came to viſit the Prior, and informed
him in what a ſcandalous, fooliſh Condition we
had been obſerved on the publick Ramparts, which
ſo highly incens'd our Governor, that after ſeveral
Reprimands, he ordered us both to be ſmartly
ſlogg'd. I was then in Poetry, and therefore was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0722300500:21"/>
ſo highly exaſperated at this Inſult, that I reſolved
to lay aſide all thoughts of any further Progreſs in
my Learning, and therefore betook myſelf to a
ſullen and continued Silence, which I ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for near a Month, and no Perſuaſions were
able to alter my perverſe Diſpoſition, till Father
<hi>Howard</hi> took me to taſk, and by his winning Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability,
prevail'd on my ſullen Temper. This
Gentleman indulged me with the free Uſe of his
Chamber, where I ſpent my leiſure Hours with
the umtoſt Pleaſure in the Peruſal of his Books,
and was highly delighted with his ingenious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
and Obſervations, on ſuch Authors as beſt
ſuited my Genius, and heightened the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of my growing Capacity. Thus having
relinquiſhed all Deſires of coming to England, I
cloſely followed my Studies, and having ran
through all the Claſſicks, I proceeded to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
paſs'd through my Dialect of Logick, and
was juſt entring upon a Courſe of Metaphyſicks,
when an Order came for my immediate return
Home.</p>
            <p>This unexpected News greatly ſurprized the
whole Houſe, and the Prior with my Conſent
wrote to my Father, in the moſt moving Terms,
urg'd the future Advantage I ſhould reap by a full
Concluſion of what I had ſo happily began; but
all his Endeavours were in vain, for the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
remained inflexible, and once more ſent a
poſitive Order for my Removal, and alſo for five
Guineas for my Return Home. Thus having
bid adieu, and taken my laſt Farewell of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and all my Fellow-Students, with Tears
in my Eyes, I took Coach to St. <hi>Omers.</hi> We had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0722300500:22"/>
not drove above a Mile or two out of Town, but
my gloomy Melancholy was diſpers'd and diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the Sprightlineſs and Alacrity of my Fellow-Travellers,
conſiſting of two <hi>French</hi> Officers and
three Ladies. The Thoughts of a College Life,
were now turned into Gaiety and Pleaſure, and I
was emulous to outſhine the Officers in Point of
Complaiſance to my fair female Companions. At
Night we arrived at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> where we had an
elegant Supper, and ſpent the Evening with the
utmoſt Mirth and Delight. The Ladies being
excuſed from any Part in the Reckoning, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Cuſtom of <hi>France.</hi> From thence I took
Poſt to <hi>Calais,</hi> and lodged at the Sign of the <hi>Ville
des Londres</hi> (or the City of <hi>London</hi>) where I met
with ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen and Ladies that
were waiting a Paſſage to <hi>England.</hi> Next Day hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Letter of Recommendation to my old Friend
Mr. <hi>Francia,</hi> I went and din'd with him, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
offered me the free Uſe of his Houſe dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſtay at <hi>Calais</hi>; but pleaſed with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of diverting Company at my Inn, I modeſtly
declined his courteous Offer, becauſe thereby I
had a greater Freedom of indulging my juvenile
Follies and Extravagancies. The Wind continuing
<hi>N. W.</hi> for near three Weeks, no Veſſel could ſtir
out of the Harbour, wherefore my Money being
almoſt exhauſted by this unexpected Delay, I was
obliged to make Proof of Mr. <hi>Francia's</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
who procured me a Paſſage on board the
<hi>Mary</hi> Sloop, Capt. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> who quartered at the
ſame Inn with me and the reſt of the Company,
who were all his Paſſengers. At laſt the Wind
chopping about to the Southward, we all embark'd,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0722300500:23"/>
caſt of from the Key, and had a pleaſant Paſſage
to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where we went aſhore, and ſupped at
the <hi>Faulcon</hi> Tavern and drank plentifully; but
here I confeſs I ſat on Thorns, for having expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all my Money, I was at a great Loſs how to
diſcharge my Share of the Reckoning. At laſt I
aſſumed an Air of Boldneſs, and putting my Hand
in my Pocket, aſked the Gentleman that ſat next
to me, if he would favour me with Change of a
Piſtole, telling him that I had no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coin;
the Gentleman replied, Sir, a Crown is at your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I humbly thank'd him and readily accepted
the pleaſing Proffer, which was ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my Dividend of the Reckoning; highly
delighted at my good Luck, and the generous
Treatment of a Stranger.</p>
            <p>At laſt we arrived at <hi>Tower-ſtairs,</hi> and having
returned many Thanks to the abovementioned
Gentleman, and gave him Directions where my
Father liv'd, I took my leave of the reſt of the
Company, went aſhore, and call'd a Coach, and
order'd him to drive to <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</hi> My
Father was ſtanding at his Door, but ſcarcely knew
me, habited like a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and dreſſed <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
de Paris,</hi> till at laſt recovering himſelf from
his Surprize, he took me into the Parlour and
there tenderly embraced me. Numbers of the
Neighbours came to compliment me on my ſafe
return Home. Sometime after I had refreſhed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the good old Gentleman aſked me, what
Courſe of Life I was willing to embrace, for my
future Support and Maintenance. I propoſed the
Study of the Law, or Phyſic, both which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0722300500:24"/>
and I at laſt by his earneſt Sollicitations,
was bound Apprentice to him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Gilpin,</hi> (my Fellow Apprentice)
having then about one Year and a half to ſerve, my
Father made uſe of this Opportunity, of giving
me a further Education, and more ſuitable for the
Tranſaction of Public Buſineſs than the former,
and therefore he ſent me to Mr. <hi>Yeate</hi>'s Academy,
in <hi>Chancery-Lane,</hi> there to be perfect in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.
He likewiſe provided me a <hi>French</hi> Maſter,
who daily came to inſtruct me in the Theory of
that uſeful Language, of which before I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the practick Part. In the Evening, I
went to a <hi>German</hi> Limner, in <hi>Craven-Buildings,</hi>
there to learn that noble and ingenious Science of
Drawing, ſo vaſtly beneficial in all the Stages of
human Life. Thus for a conſiderable Time, my
Thoughts were wholly intent on the Purſuit of the
abovementioned Accompliſhments; till by Degrees
falling into Company with ſome other gay Sparks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I grew weary of my habitual Exerciſes, and ſoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

of the Town; this Nymph, ſo ſtruck me at
the firſt Sight, that I reſolved at all Events to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her Home, which as it happened was not far
off that Part of the Town, being the uſual Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for thoſe of her Stamp. In ſhort, ſeeing her
go into a Houſe, I thought myſelf ſecure, and
went to a neighbouring Publican's, where calling
for a Quartern of Brandy, by the Deſcription of
my fair Charmer, I ſoon found that that was the
uſual Place of her Reſidence and Abode. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
having then a Charge of Plate, and being in
a Diſhable, I durſt not preſume to gratify my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Deſires with my fair <hi>Phillis</hi> for the preſent,
but reſolved at all Events to viſit her, the <hi>Sunday</hi>
following, and therefore I diſcharged my Truſt
and went Home. Her lovely Form, filled my
Soul, and therefore all my earneſt Care and Study
was, how to raiſe Money ſufficient to indulge and
gratify my eager Wiſhes in the Poſſeſſion of thoſe
Charms, with which I was ſo paſſionately enamour'd.
Now Fortune, by the following unexpected Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
gave me an Opportunity to furniſh myſelf
with a Sufficiency to execute my amorous Exploit.
My Father according to Cuſtom, being gone to
ſmoak a Pipe after Dinner, I was left alone in the
Shop, and knowing that he would not return in
leſs than an Hour, I thought this a proper Time to
execute my intended Project; then going to his
Deſk, to my great Joy and Surprize found the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0722300500:26"/>
Key in it, and willingly embracing this favourable
Opportunity, opened the Deſk, and took ſeven
Guineas out of the three ſeveral Bags, leaſt that
Sum, if taken out of one, ſhould be miſſed, and
I ſuſpected of the Fraud. No ſooner had I put
the Money in my Pocket, but I called up the
Maid to look after the Shop, whilſt I went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and hid the Money, leaſt perchance I ſhould
be diſcovered, and the Caſh found upon me. But
the old Gentleman who never kept any regular
Account thereof, never miſſed it, and I the <hi>Sunday</hi>
following, having dreſſed myſelf to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
put three Guineas of my ſtolen Treaſure
into my Pocket, and about three in the Afternoon
went to viſit my lovely Goddeſs. Her Apartment
was up one-Pair-of-Stairs, well furniſhed, her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
an old ſuperannuated Curtezan, worn out
in the Wars of <hi>Venus,</hi> who in a ſnuffling Tone,
aſked me what I would pleaſe to have? I briſkly
reply'd, your Lady. Sir, ſays ſhe, pleaſe to walk
in, and ſhe will be here immediately. I obeyed
the old Hag's Command, and ſeated myſelf in the
Dining Room, where the old Bawd fatigued me
with the fulſome and impertinent Diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her former antiquated Amours, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
me to treat her with a Glaſs of Wine; I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
conſented, and flung down two Shillings for a
Bottle; preſently after, in came my <hi>Phillis,</hi> I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,
and paying my Reſpects, civilly ſaluted her.
She returned the Compliment, and ſeating herſelf
by me, with a pleaſing Air of Gaiety, and careleſs
Negligence, orders her Servant to put on the Tea
Kettle. Her Diſcourſe was melting and amorous,
which ſo raiſed my youthful Vigour, that unable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0722300500:27"/>
any longer to oppoſe the mighty Force of Love,
with eager Haſte, I conducted her to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber;
but not willing ſo ſoon to quit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of my Darling, I propoſed a Supper at the
<hi>Fountain</hi> Tavern, in <hi>Katherine-ſtreet,</hi> and ſhe readily
yielded to my Requeſt. But it being Summer-Time,
and a fine Day, I handed her to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Place of Rendezvous, but was (to my
Sorrow afterward) obſerved and taken Notice of
by my Father, who watched my Motions, and ſaw
me go into the ſaid Tavern. Nevertheleſs, for
ſome ſecret Cauſe unknown to me, he avoided my
Sight; and I wholly intent on my amorous Dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Love, never ſo much as ſaw him, nor had
the leaſt Suſpicion of his being privy to my ſecret
Amour. In ſhort, we had an elegant Supper,
Arrack Punch, Jellies, and other Provocations to
Luſt, and about Three in the Morning I diſcharg'd
the Reckoning, ſatisfied my mercenary Nymph for
her Attendance, and well pleaſed with this my firſt
Entrance into this new Scene of Life, went
Home, little thinking how dearly I ſhould pay
for ſo trivial and tranſitory a Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The next Day my Father called me to him, and
with an angry and frowning Countenance, aſked me
where I had been Yeſterday in the Afternoon, and
what induced me to keep ſuch unreaſonable
Hours? I replied that I had been at Church, and
afterwards in Company with two or three of my
Companions. Mr. <hi>Gilpert,</hi> ſays he, I know your
Tricks, and therefore think myſelf in Duty bound
to chaſtiſe, and reſtrain your libidinous Exceſſes, by
a timely and ſevere Puniſhment; ſo taking me
down into the Cellar, he made me ſtrip, and there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0722300500:28"/>
ſcourg'd me very heartily with a Horſewhip, and
afterwards ordered that I ſhould not be admitted
again to his Table, until by my future and good
Behaviour, I had amply atoned for my former paſt
Offence. But this harſh Treatment had not the
deſired Effect; for being baniſhed from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
I dined with the Maid, and my Deſires
daily waxed more fierce and ardent; wherefore to
appeaſe the Rage and Torrent of Luſt, I made a
vigorous Attack on the Servant, who neither
armed with the Shield of Modeſty or Virtue, made
a faint Reſiſtance, and ſoon rendered herſelf a
Victim. Nor was I wanting in Generoſity to my
new and pretty. I cannot omit to tell you, that
one Day having bought a Pair of Gold laced Shoes
for my <hi>Chloe,</hi> (my Father being out) I called her
up into the Parlour, and ſhut the Shop Door. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid I, ſaluting her; pleaſe to accept of this
Trifle, and with it the Heart of your Admirer.
This, I preſume, is a Proof of your being ſole
Miſtreſs of my Eſteem and Affections, which I
ſhall always maintain fixed and unalterable. Chloe
well pleaſed with the Preſent, fondly careſſed me,
which ſo fann'd the amorous Flame, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
my Father's expected immediate Return,
or any one's coming about Buſineſs, I haſten'd to
enjoy her. But as the Devil would have it my
Father knock'd at the Door, at which Confuſion
and Shame o'erſpread my Countenance. However,
<hi>Chloe</hi> had the good Fortune to get off unperceived
by him, who ſeeing the lac'd Shoes ſtanding on
the Table, ſaid, Pray whoſe are theſe? methink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they are very gay. I replied, Sir, a Lady of
whom I bought ſome Silver Lace, deſir'd ſhe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0722300500:29"/>
might leave them here till her return. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
as I plainly perceived was not ſatisfactory to
the old Gentleman, who ever after kept a ſtricter
Eye both on my Conduct in Point of Honeſty, and
Behaviour towards the Maid; wherefore I grew
more cautious and artful in tricking him of Caſh,
and more vigilant and circumſpect in the Purſuit
of my Amours, till having by Hypocriſy, and
a well diſſembled good Behaviour, reinſtated my
ſelf in the Love and Eſteem of my Father.</p>
            <p>I was again admitted to his Table, and all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Flights of Youth buried in Oblivion, till one
<hi>Sunday</hi> Night coming Home drunk, and finding
no body there, but the Maid, I out of a Frolick,
toyed with her on the Kitchen Floor, but by ill
Fortune was again ſurpriz'd by my Father, who
contrary to Cuſtom opening the Shutters of the
Kitchen Window, ſaw me engaging in the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Combat.</p>
            <p>The Wench and I were both ignorant of this
unexpected Diſcovery, and he for that Night took
no Notice thereof; but the next Morning he called
up the Maid, whom he immediately diſcharged,
and ſeverely reprimanded me, vowing by all that
was good and ſacred, that if I ever was guilty of
the like Impudence, he would totally diſcard, and
turn me like a Vagabond out of Doors; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
to prevent ſuch Diſorders in his Houſe,
he hired a grave, ſedate Matron, and who (as he
thought) was paſt the Follies and Dalliances of
Love; but as there can be no Reaſon aſſigned for
that bewitching Paſſion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o neither the wrinkled
Furrows of her aged Face, nor the Vigilancy of
my Father, were able to reſtrain my furious and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0722300500:30"/>
ardent Deſires of enjoying that living Sepulchre;
but as Youth and Age are as oppoſite as Fire and
Water, ſo the cold and feeble Embraces of this
antiquated Dame, ſerv'd only to allay and quench
my luſtful Ardour, which reillumin'd by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and pleaſing Objects of the Town, therefore
in the Bloom of vigorous Youth I purſed the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Fair ones, who tho' like the Apples of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi>
they appear beauteous and alluring without,
yet are their Inſides both rotten and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
            <p>I ſoon grew tainted by their poiſonous Infection,
for the Cure of which, I ſecretly apply'd myſelf to
an able Surgeon, who religiouſly kept my Secret,
and faithfully diſcharged his Truſt with Honour
and Integrity.</p>
            <p>One Evening being in Liquor, as I croſſed <hi>Drury
Lane,</hi> I was ſaluted by a Female, who in a ſoft
and engaging Voice ſaid, Come my Dear, won't
you give me a Pint of Wine, and as <hi>Bacchus</hi> is
the conſtant Companion of Love, I replied, Yes,
my Angel; ſo in I carried her to the <hi>Feathers</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
up Stairs we went, and I called for a Bottle
of Wine, when as ſoon as we had drank a Glaſs
or two a-piece, I grew paſſionately fond of my
new Prize, which ſhe obſerving, and ſeeing me
diſguiſed in Liquor, reſolved to make her Market,
and therefore inſiſted upon Half a Crown before
Hand; I condeſcended, and fooliſhly gave it her,
but was then no nearer the Point I aim'd at than
before: Well ſaid ſhe, give me the other two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Sixpence, and you ſhall be feaſted, which
I had no ſooner parted with, and was preparing for
the wanton Engagement, but upon a Stamp that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0722300500:31"/>
ſhe gave with her Foot, in ruſh'd four more bold
Viragoes, who ſeizing me, held my Hands, and
rifled my Pockets, ſwearing that if I offered to
make a Noiſe, or cry out, that they would charge
me with a Conſtable, for attempting to abuſe them.
At the Word Conſtable, I was ſorely affrighted,
fearing I ſhould be expoſed, and my Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
acquainted therewith; wherefore I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
condeſcended to what I could by no Means
prevent.</p>
            <p>When they had robbed me of every Thing valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
except my Cloaths, they ſwore they would
ſtrip me, if I did not call for a Bottle of Arrack,
wherefore to prevent the impending Ruin, that
would have proved my total Overthrow, I readily
ſubmitted to their Impoſition, and ringing the
Bell odrered the Drawer to bring in my Forfeit,
(for that was the Term they ordered me to make
uſe of;) no ſooner was the Bottle out, but the ſhe
devils diſappeared, and left me alone to bemoan
my unfortunate diſappointment.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I went to the Bar, and loudly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the ill Treament I had met with, but it
availed nothing, for the Landlady inſiſted on her
Reckoning, and ſaid, Sir, I know nothing of the
Women, they came in with you, had you applied
to me for a Lady I ſhould have provided you one,
and been accountable for her Civility and good
Behaviour; at length finding it in vain to diſpute,
I left my Waiſtcoat to ſatisfy her Demands, and
went Home much ſobered by the Fright and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
that I had been in.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, ſtanding alone at the Shop Door,
an old Woman came and gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me a Letter ſealed with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0722300500:32"/>
a Thimble, (a Mark peculiar to fallen Women) I
opened it, and found by the Scrawl, that it came from
the Maid whom my Father had formerly diſcharged
on my Account; the Contents were, that ſhe was big
with Child, and expected in a Fortnight or three
Weeks to be brought to Bed; and therefore if I was
willing to ſcreen myſelf from Shame and Diſgrace,
I muſt take Care, purſuant to the Directions in the
Letter, either to come and ſee her, or elſe ſend a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſupply during her lying-in; but that if I failed
to comply with her requeſt, that ſhe ſhould through
neceſſity be forced to expoſe me. I was not a little
ſtartled at this ſudden, and, as I thought, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
demand; however, I gave the Bearer half a
crown for her uſe, and ſixpence for her own trouble in
bringing the unwelcome letter, with a promiſe ſhortly
to viſit my Molly, and eaſe her under her misfortunes;
but as the old ſaying is, <hi>Out of ſight out of Mind,</hi>
I forgot my promiſe, but ſhe ſtrictly obſerved hers, for
in leſs than three Weeks ſhe ſwore the baſtard to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and I was taken into cuſtody for the ſame. Hereupon
I immediately wrote to my father, who came and
paſſed his word to ſee the affair compounded, which he
in three days time, upon the payment of 15 <hi>l.</hi> with
the utmoſt ſecrecy effected.</p>
            <p>This was a ſtanding memorial of my folly, and
therefore to blot out the remembrance of it, I ſeemed
vaſtly uneaſy and ſhagrined, inſomuch, that my father
took notice thereof, and kindly compaſſionating my
anxious troubles, and diſquietude of mind, gener ouſly
forgave the offence, and promiſed never to reflect on
theſe my former f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ights of youth. Having thus freed
myſelf from this ſcandalous reflection, I purſued my
former pleaſures, and being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

credit with my father, I artfully altering the figures
and current of the caſh book, amaſſed together a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſum, which I hid in the cellar, making uſe
thereof on extraordinary occaſions. My reigning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
were <hi>Molly St. Gerrge, Phebe Player,</hi>
and <hi>Sally King,</hi> with whom I indulged myſelf in all
libidinous exceſſes, as often as time or opportunity
would permit.</p>
            <p>Being now almoſt grown to man's eſtate, and my
father was taken very ill, and obliged to keep his bed,
and therefore the whole charge of the buſineſs lay upon
my hands, and to do myſelf juſtice, (during the time
of his ſickneſs) I faithfully diſcharged the great truſt
repoſed in me; honour, gratitude, and filial duty,
gaining the aſcendant over the baſe allurements of a
depraved nature. Now the good gentleman dying, left
me a large fortune, and a ſhop well ſtocked with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of plate, jewels, and other valuable effects,
as alſo a ſet of worthy gentlemen for my cuſtomers,
who (to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>onour and credit be it ſpoken) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their debts due to the deceaſed, and continued
their favours to me his unworthy ſon. My father no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
three Executors, viz. <hi>Francis Cunning,</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Mr. <hi>Richard Lacon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Gilpin,</hi>
who all unanimouſly agreed, that I, altho' under age,

               </gap> as an
Overſeer and obſerver of my behaviour in this new

            <p>Now the goddeſs of fortune ſeemed to ſhower down
her favours on me, and my trade daily encreaſing, I
found it abſolutely neceſſary to hire a journeyman, and
a boy to run on errands. I now totally relinquiſhed
all thoughts of extravagancy, abhorred and deteſted
my former vicious courſe of life, and therefore for my

inſtruction and amuſement, I furniſhed myſelf with a

in my buſineſs, that it was the received and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
opinion of the town, that young <hi>Langley</hi> would
in a few years gain a plentiful eſtate; and had I been
ſo happy as to have maintained the prudent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Oeconomy that I obſerved at my firſt launching
out into the world, I had certainly verified thoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
conceptions that the town in general had conceiv'd
of me; for in the firſt year that I followed buſineſs,
upon the ballance of accounts, I found myſelf 700 <hi>l.</hi>
gainer by my trade, and that more likely to encreaſe
than diminiſh, if I trod thoſe paths in which I had ſo

I propoſed to conduct him to the apartments of
one of my favourite ladies; he ſeemed highly pleaſed
with the proffer, and took coach and drove to madam's
lodgings, who being a well bred woman, entertained us
in a courteous and obliging manner: The old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was ſoon captivated with her charms, and burn'd
for enjoyment, which I obſerving, called her aſide,
and ſaid, Madam, the gentleman is my uncle, and
therefore I deſire you would oblige him, and me alſo,
in the requeſt I am now going to make you; ſhe, with
a ſmile conſented; whereupon, I ordered her, whilſt
the fumbler was in the vain purſuit of delight, to
pick his pocket of ſome notes that I knew he had
about him. She faithfully performed her promiſe,
and afterwards gave them into my Hands.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this, ſhe and he (after ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to do, what in reality he could not effect) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into the dining-room, little thinking of the
merry trick that had been put upon him. To be brief,
we ſtaid till about three in the morning, then calling a
coach, went home.</p>
            <p>The next day, recollecting himſelf where he had
been, and miſſing his bills, called for me, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me with his loſs, and that he ſuſpected that, that
damn'd painted whore had ſtolen them from him. I
ſeemed to be in a paſſion, and ſware, that I believed
ſhe would ſcorn ſo baſe an action, but that for his
ſatisfaction, I would go and enquire into the matter,
and at the ſame time let him know, that if ſhe had
them, ſhe would inſiſt on a handſome preſent on the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0722300500:36"/>
delivery of the ſame; damn her, ſays he, give her two
guineas, and place them to my account. Thus the old
gentleman paid the forfeit due to his folly, and Mrs.
<hi>Morris</hi> and I revelled the enſuing night at his coſt
and charge. This impoſition gave the old fool ſuch a
diſtaſte and abhorrence to the female proſtitutes, that
after I had returned him his notes, he ſolemly vowed
and declared never to converſe with any of them for
the future.</p>
            <p>Sometime after, (as the Biter is Bit at laſt) a
Gentleman well dreſſed, ſtopt at my Door in a
Coach, and coming into the Shop, complimented
me on my Father's Deceaſe, and expreſſed the
great Value and Eſteem he had for him, and that
upon his Account he was willing to continue his
Favours, for the Encouragement of me his Son.
I humbly thank'd him for his Civility, and told
him, I ſhould ſtrenuouſly endeavour to maintain
the good Repute, and fair Character of my deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Father, by a ſtrict Adherence to his Principles
of inviolable Honour, and Integrity. He, full
fraught with Deceit, ſeem'd highly pleaſed with
my Reply; and therefore, as a ſeeming Promiſe of
his Friendſhip, beſpoke 150<hi>l.</hi> worth of Plate, and
after he had given me the Impreſſion of his Coat
of Arms, from a Seal that hung to his Gold
Watch, ſaid, He ſhould be glad to take a Glaſs of
Wine with me. I was proud of the Honour, and
we went to a neighbouring Tavern, where drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plentifully, he took the Opportunity, whilſt I
was elevated with Liquor, to propoſe a Lady to me
in Marriage, who (altho' deform'd) he ſaid, had
50,000<hi>l.</hi> Fortune; and further more he added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that ſhe was under his Tuition, and Direction of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0722300500:37"/>
his Spouſe; and that if I pleaſed to come down to
his Country Seat, he would engage to gain her
Conſent, and bring her to a very ſpeedy Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>This artful Bait had its deſir'd Effect, for I now
not only look'd on him as a good Cuſtomer, but
as a worthy Friend, and therefore I invited him
to Dinner with me the next Day, and he in return
engaged me to ſup with him the next Evening at
his Lodgings in Taviſtock-Street where an elegant
Entertainment was provided. The Chambers
were richly furniſh'd, and illuminated with Wax
Candles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſilver Candleſticks, and Sconces, in
the ſame Metal; two Footmen in lac'd Liveries
waited at Supper, and every Thing augmented
the Opinion I had already received of his being
a Gentleman of a large and plentiful Eſtate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Twelve I took my Leave of him, and the
next Day gave Orders for getting ready his Plate
as ſoon as poſſible, which being done, he in about a
Week's Time came to me; I ſhew'd him the
Plate, with which he was extreamly pleaſed, and
highly commended the curious Workmanſhip
thereof; and ſaid, Sir, Come let's take a Bottle
before we part, for to Morrow Morning I muſt go
to my Country Seat. I with Pleaſure yielded to
his Requeſt, and whilſt we were in the Tavern,
he pull'd out his Pocket-Book, and gave me a
Note on a Vintner in Bartholomew-Cloſe, for
150 <hi>l.</hi> payable in three Weeks; ſaying, Sir, This
I preſume is the ſame to you as ready Caſh; but
pleaſe for your own Satisfaction, to ſend immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and enquire into the Character of the Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I readily obey'd his Order, and finding by the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0722300500:38"/>
Account I receiv'd from my Servant, that the
Vintner was a Perſon of a fair Character; upon
his Endorſement of the Note, I accepted it in full
Payment for my Goods, and ſent the Plate pack'd
up to the Gun Tavern at Billingſgate, purſuant to
his Order; neither did I forget to take a Direction
where he liv'd in the Country, but promiſed, as
ſoon as poſſible to viſit my intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wealthy
Bride.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we parted, and I went Home quite
blown up with the aſpiring Thoughts of raiſing my
Fortune at once and making a ſplendid and gay
Appearance in the World; but as I lay one Night
in my Bed, ruminating on the imaginary Poſſeſſion
of the Nymph, who (like the Goddeſs of Riches)
was to load me with her Favours a ſudden Thought
eclipſed my Joys, perhaps (ſays I to myſelf) I am
deceived, and this great Fortune like Fary-land,
as ſoon as ſeen diſappears, wherefore I reſolv'd to
ſend to my Neighbour <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> (a cunning and artful
Man, whoſe Veracity and Integrity I had often
experienced) the next Day down to the Gentleman's
Seat, with Orders to make a private Enquiry in
the Neighbourhood, of the Truth and Reality of
what my ſeeming Friend had given me ſo fair an
Expectance of. Accordingly I gave him two
Guineas, and loaded with Inſtructions, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>I was now rack'd with alternate Hope and Fear
till his Return, which was in three Days Time,
when he ingeniouſly told me, that after the utmoſt
Search and ſtricteſt Scrutiny it was poſſible for
Man to make, he could not find out, or even hear
of any ſuch Gentleman or Lady that ever lived or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0722300500:39"/>
reſided in that Country. This was ſhocking News
to me, and I reaſonably conjectured, that ſince
I was deceiv'd in my Miſtreſs, there was alſo ſome
Fallacy in the Note he had given me in Payment
for my Goods; but ſince I had accepted the ſame,
I knew no other Remedy but to wait with Patience,
till Time ſhould bring to Light the Fraud, and
diſcover the whole Villainy. As I judged, ſo it
happened, for on ſending my Servant with the
Note, after three Days Grace to demand the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the Vintner was gone, and his Houſe ſhut
up. Highly incens'd at this baſe and ſcandalous
Trick I vowed revenge on the pretended Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and reſolved if poſſible, at all Events, to lay
him by the Heels, and make an Example of him,
to deter others from the like Falſhood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
            <p>About a Fortnight afterwards, a Gentlewoman
came to my Shop, and deſired to ſpeak with me
in private; I led her into the Parlour, where ſhe
immediately burſt out into Tears, and for ſome
Time, could not utter a Word, till being recover'd
from her Diſorder, ſhe ſaid, Sir, I am ruin'd and
undone for ever, that Villain <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

Money to his own Uſe.</p>
            <p>This (I confeſs) at firſt ſtartled me, but upon a
further enquiry, I found that her huſband was the

this ganerous proffer, and a farther aſſurance of my

                  </gap>,</hi>ſhe humbly thank'd me
and departed, leaving directions with me where to
find her husband.</p>
            <p>Next Day, according to my promiſe, I went to
the Gentlemen, who being of tender and human
Diſpoſitions, were eaſily brought to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,

<hi>Fleet Street,</hi> near St. <hi>Dunſtan's,</hi> a ſtrange Gentleman
came up to me, and aſked me, whether my Name

Yes, Sir, quoth I, well then ſaid he, we'll ſtep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bull Head, and there I'll inform you further
of the Matter. So in we went, where he told me,
that he had <hi>G<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Dead-ſet,</hi> and that if I would
give him one Guinea, he would engage to have
him in cloſe Quarters in leſs than an Hour,
Overjoyed at this News, I freely granted him his
Demand, and told him that I would wait there till
his return; but had I been as good as my Word, I
ſhould have ſtaid there till now, for I never ſaw
him afterwards. This ſecond Bite exaſperated me
more than the former, and I reſolved if ever I

I employed a briſk and expert Attorney to
hunt him out, and promiſed to be accountable for
all Charges in the Execution thereof. At laſt, I
took the Villain, and clapt him into the <hi>Marſhal-Priſon,</hi>
where he obliged me to ſue him to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and there he remained during the whole
Time that I continued in Trade.</p>
            <p>Some Time after this, I became acquainted with
a Vintner, near Gray's Inn Gate, in Holborn,
with whom I contracted ſuch an Intimacy that very
Evening I paid a Viſit, and he was fooliſhly fond
of Horſe Racing, Cock Fighting, Hunting, and
the like expenſive and coſtly Paſtimes, and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and being a conſtant Attendant at <hi>Newmarket</hi>
Seaſons, kept a good Gelding for that Purpoſe.
Being daily at his Houſe, he often ſollicited me to
accompany him thither, and greatly enlarged on
the Grandeur of the Aſſembly, and the Variety of
Recreations and Amuſements that preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

the Wit and Diſcretion to carry it off; but this
was but a glimmering of life, that vainly buoys
up the departing Patient, before the fatal approach
of Death; for in leſs than ſix Months, I doubled
the Loſs of my former Gain, and by my too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

in a melancholy Poſture, and my Subſtance

me in the leaſt guilty of ſo much Imprudence and
Folly.</p>
            <p>One Day being at my Friend the Vintner's

ſomething ſo innocent and modeſt in her Behaviour,
that ſo inſenſibly ſtole upon me, that in deſpite of
my vicious and inordinate Deſires, her Virtue ſo
awed and reſtrained my villainous Intentions, that
for ſome Time, I durſt not approach her but with
the utmoſt Reſpect and Modeſty, till one fatal
Night to her, coming Home a little elate with
Liquor, I called for a Bottle of Wine, and deſired
her Company to partake of it; ſhe with a Bluſh

than diminiſhed my Paſſion; and therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

Opportunity to acquaint her with my ſincere Love,

Ends, and was far more deſerving of being
the legal Partner of a Marriage Bed, than Miſtreſs
of a lawleſs Love, that ſometime or other would
prove her Ruin.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, had I been ſo happy and prudent, as to
have made her my Wife, I am well aſſured, that
the Union of the ſacred Knot, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
me from various Inconveniences, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
Poverty and horrid Want in the Sequal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
me to. During the Heat of my Amour, I
had ſeveral advantageous Offers of Marriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to me, which I declined for the following
Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Parents or Friends of ſuch
young Ladies that were actually in a Capacity to
beſtow on them large Fortunes, inſiſted on proper
Settlements for their Daughters, and alſo an exact
Scrutiny into my Affairs, which although by my
artful and deceitful Conduct, appeared to be in a
flouriſhing Condition, yet if nicely examined into,
there was nothing to be found, but the Ruins, and
poor Remains of a ſhattered Fortune; for by this
Time I had obtained a conſiderable Credit from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Merchants in Jewels, and by the punctual
Payment of my Bills, my Notes paſſed as current
as thoſe of the <hi>Bank,</hi> and I confequently was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a great and eminent Trader, particularly in
that moſt advantageous and profitable Part of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
but alaſs! to my Sorrow, I only fulfilled
the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>Robbing</hi> Peter to <hi>pay</hi>
Paul; for under the ſpecious Pretence of diſpoſing
of the abovementioned Goods to Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
I ſecretly pawned them to thoſe, who out of
a ſordid Lucre of Gain, and an avaracious Deſire of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0722300500:46"/>
more than legal Intereſt, ſupplied me with what
Caſh I required, and by their Indiſcretion and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in relyiag on my Integrity, ſuffered them to be
greatly impoſed upon by me, who frequently bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
larger Sums on thoſe Goods, than what I
had contracted to pay for them.</p>
            <p>By this Means I had always a large Quantity of
Money at my Command, and thinking this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
would always paſs undiſcovered, I liv'd more
like an Heir apparent to a great Eſtate, than a
wary and induſtrious Tradeſman. Aſſemblies,
Opera's, Maſquerades, Plays, and Country Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
were now my only Delight, and my
ſole favourite Companions, ſuch young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were either in the full Poſſeſſion
of large Eſtates, or in a fair Expectation of the
ſame.</p>
            <p>I can't omit, that two of theſe young Sparks
and I, having made an Agreement to paſs a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
or three Weeks at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> for the Benefit
of the Air in the Summer Seaſon, we quartered
at the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Inn there; when one Evening
over a merry Bottle, a Propoſal was made to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole
through the Town in queſt of Ladies of
Pleaſure, which was readily agreed too by all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but finding none there either handſome enough
or fitting for our Purpoſes, I immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to return to <hi>London,</hi> and bring down three
of the beſt of that Stamp, that I could find were
willing to indulge themſelves with the Diverſions
of a Country Life. My Companions highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
my Deſign, and I took a pair of Oars,
which preſently waſted me to <hi>Temple-Stairs,</hi> where
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0722300500:47"/>
as ſoon as I landed, I went in Purſuit of my Game,
and being well known to the Porter at the <hi>Roſe</hi>
in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> to him I apply'd for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Porter went directly out, whilſt I called for
a Pint of Wine, to wait for his Return, who in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half an Hour's Time brought three wanton
Laſſes well dreſſed, and not diſagreeable; I aroſe,
and ſaluting them, ſaid, Ladies, pleaſe to ſeat your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
my Buſineſs is to acquaint you, that your
Company is deſired for a Fortnight or three Weeks
at Greenwich, where you may be aſſured to be
treated in the moſt courteous and polite Manner;
for the Perſons that you will have to do with,
are Gentlemen of Honour, and therefore if you
approve of my Propoſal, pleaſe to provide your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſuch Linnen and Apparel as you ſhall
think proper for your Uſe, during your Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Country, I'll remain here an Hour
longer; ſo Ladies, if ye are willing, go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
yourſelves for the Journey. They unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
agreed, and dropping a Curtiſie at their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Room, returned with their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
within the Time appointed. I called a Coach
and drove to the <hi>Temple Stairs,</hi> where I took a Pair
of Oars, and landed at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> but not without
the repeated Inſults of opprobious Language, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
uſed by the Vulgar on the <hi>Thames</hi>; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
my Female Companions verified the Latin
Adage, <hi>Nemo me impune laceſſit,</hi> and returned their
Scurrility with as ſmart and ſatyrical repartees, as
if they had ſerved a ſeven Years Apprenticeſhip
to any of the moſt celebrated Fiſhwomen at <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0722300500:48"/>
I looked upon myſelf now as an Eaſtern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
bearing as abſolute Sway in my floating
Seraglio, as the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> ever did in his
ſumptuous Edifice at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In ſhort I
conducted the Ladies to the <hi>Greyhound</hi> Inn, where
my Companions were with Impatience, waiting
for my Return. Upon our Entrance into the
Room, they civilly complimented the Women,
and we being all ſeated, I ſaid, Gentlemen, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
I have anſwered your Expectations, and
honourably diſcharged my Truſt, pleaſe therefore
to take the firſt Choice, and the Nymph that hath
not the Honour to pleaſe either of you, ſhall be
the Co-Partner of my Bed, and be taken under
immediate Care and Protection. This generous
Offer augmented their Delight, and each <hi>Pyramis</hi>
choſe his favourite <hi>Thiſbe.</hi> Now nothing was to
be ſeen but perfect Harmony, and an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Scene of Joys, the Gods of Love and Wine,
by alternate Poſſeſſion, reſided in our Hearts, nor
were the <hi>Sylvan</hi> Deities exempt from participating
the mutual and tranſporting Pleaſures that we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poſſeſſed, in the ſhady Retirement of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Park; but thoſe ſoft and endearing Careſſes
of our amorous Goddeſſes, by reiterated Repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
grew dull and infipid, and we cloy'd and
wearied with the continual Performance of daily
Sacrifice to the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Dame, reſolved to put a
merry Trick upon the Ladies, and leave them in
the Lurch.</p>
            <p>One Day after we had dined, we deſired them to
go and walk in the Park, and we would follow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
and order the Tea-kettle, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
to be brought up with us thither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0722300500:49"/>
They ſeemed well pleaſed with our Requeſt, and
readily obeyed, whereupon we called our Landlord, and
paid him his Bill, and then croſſed the Water to the
<hi>Iſle of Dogs,</hi> where we ſpent the Remainder of the
Day in Mirth and Jollity, highly diverted that we
had bilked the Proſtitutes of their expected Fare.
They walked in the Park a long Time, and ſeeing no
Appearance of us, or the Servant of the Houſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Inn, and on Enquiry, finding that we
were gone, (as the Landlord told them by our Order)
to London, they quarrelled with each other for their
Folly, in complying with our Requeſt, before they had
had Satisfaction for their Ware; but finding it in
vain to trifle away their Time in railing and ſcolding to
no Purpoſe, they hired a Pair of Oars for <hi>London</hi>
and as ill Fortune would have it, our Boats both met
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver-againſt <hi>Cuckolds Point</hi>; they immediately ſet
up a Cry, that both alarmed and ſurprized us, the
Female Virago's were for boarding, but we ſheered off
as faſt as we could, and encouraging our Watermen to
make Way, we in ſpite of our Adverſaries, kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſour Boats Length a-head of them, but were
forced to bear the Laſh of their Tongues, till we got
within three or four Yards of the Landing Place of
the <hi>Temple,</hi> and then we jumped aſhore, making the
beſt of our Way to one of the Gentlemen's Chambers,
to prevent the Scandal and Diſturbance that would
have enſued, had they come up with us.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, a married Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, deſired me to accompany him and his
Spouſe to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> to which I readily aſſented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glad of the Opportunity to make knownn my Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Miſs <hi>Jenny,</hi> their Chambermaid, we ſtopt
at the Gun Tavern at <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and put three
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0722300500:50"/>
Bottles of Wine into the Boat, to animate our Spirits,
and excite Mirth and Gaiety in our Paſſage to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Port. The Gentleman aſked me, if I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him to an Inn? Yes, Sir, I replyed, and
the beſt in Town, where I have been very civilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
the Landlord knows me perfectly well, and
I'll engage that you and your Lady ſhall be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to the utmoſt of your Deſires; and as for Miſs
<hi>Jenny,</hi> ſays I, in a jocoſe Manner, I'll recommend
her to a briſk young Fellow, that's worth Money,
though he ſerves as a Drawer in the Houſe; <hi>Jenny</hi>
bluſhed, the Lady laughed, and my Friend drank
a brave Bumper to the good Succeſs of this new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>In an Hour's Time we landed, and I led the Way
to my Inn the <hi>Greyhound,</hi> where the Maſter expreſſed
a great Satisfaction in ſeeing me, and returned me
Thanks for the Favour I did him, in recommending
his Houſe. Here we ordered a Supper, and <hi>I</hi> took an
Opportunity, whilſt <hi>Jenny</hi> was in the Kitchen, to let
her know how paſſionately I loved her, and by a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
Obſervance of her Eyes, found that my Propoſals
were not diſagreeable; wherefore I holdly urged her to
yield to my Embraces, could it be managed with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy;
whereupon I faithfully promiſed to contrive the
Matter with ſo much Privacy ond Cunning, that
none in the Houſe ſhould have the leaſt Occaſion to
dream or ſuſpect any Thing of our Amour. With
this ſolemn Aſſurance of Secrecy, confirmed with a
Volley of Oaths and Imprecations, <hi>Jenny</hi> conſented,
and the only Difficulty remaining was, to engage the
Chambermaid to be faithful to her Truſt; wherefore
I immediately took her aſide, and ſliding half a Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
into her Hand, imparted my Deſign to her, who
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0722300500:51"/>
promiſed to perform her Part to my Satisfaction. At
Supper we were exceeding merry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amd I was highly
pleaſed at the Conceit of my new Favourite, when we
ogled each other as the Figures in an old Suit of
Hangings.</p>
            <p>The Hour of Repoſe drawing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh, my Friend
called to the Chambermaid to ſhew him a Room
with two Beds in it, one for himſelf and Spouſe,
and the other for Miſs Jenny, who (the Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
big with Child) was de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired might lie in the
ſame Chamber with them; but it was all in vain,
for the artful Huſſey, well vers'd in Intrigues,
with an hypocritical Cant and Smile, declared, that
would the Gentleman give her fifty Pounds, ſhe
could not oblige him with that Favour, for all the
Rooms (except thoſe reſerved for our Lodgings)
were taken up and engaged. The Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an eaſy credulous Perſon, believed what ſhe
ſaid was true, ſo ordering her and Jenny to light
them to bed, took his Leave of me for that Night.
As ſoon as they were gone up Stairs, I called for a
Bottle of Wine, and ſat ſmoaking my Pipe with
Impatience, waiting the Return of my Miſtreſs,
who as ſoon as ſhe had undreſſed her Lady, and put
her to bed, came and ſat down by me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after in came my true and faithful Confident,
whom I deſired to ſit down and bear us Company.
When the Bottle was out, I deſired her to ſhew us
to our Room, and bring a Cool-Tankard with her
up Stairs. The Chamber we lay in was up two
Pair of Stairs backwards, and commodiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
for the like Intrigues, for there was two
Doors to it, and a private Pair of Stairs, unknown
to any but us, and the People of the Inn; ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0722300500:52"/>
that ſuppoſing the Gentleman had had any Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and ſhould have attempted (if he had known
my Apartment) to ſurprize us, it was morally
impoſſible that he ſhould ſucceed in his Deſign, for
as I locked the Door fronting the great Stair-caſe,
before we went to bed, ſo I could eaſily have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
my Doxy, by turning her out at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Stairs; but, poor Gentleman, he, I ſuppoſe,
had ſomething elſe to think on, for although Jenny
and I lay together during our whole Stay there, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he or his Spouſe ever imagined any thing of
the Matter. In about ten Days we returned to
London, where I viſiſted him as uſual, and by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Billets appointed my Charmer at the <hi>Blue Poſts</hi>
without <hi>Temple Bar</hi>; ſhe was truly obſervant to my
Aſſignations, managed her growing Burthen ſo art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that although ſhe lay with the other Maid,
yet neither ſhe, nor her Lady, for a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Time, obſerved that ſhe was with Child,
till at laſt unable to conceal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her public Shame any
longer, ſhe quitted her Service, and took private
Lodgings, from whence ſhe daily plagued me
with fulſome Letters ſtuffed with Nonſence and
Love, with which (being pretty well cloyed) the
Remembrance of her former Embraces was grown
not only grating but loathſome. However, rather
than to ſuffer her to lay the Child to me, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
her a Meeting, where to acquit myſelf
with Honour, I gave her a Purſe of Guineas, and
there took my final Leave of her, neither have I
ever heard of her ſince, nor would the Gentleman
or his Lady have been acquainted with this our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
had I not now publiſhed it to the World.
But notwithſtanding theſe Exceſſes, <hi>Clarinda,</hi> by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0722300500:53"/>
Merit claimed the greateſt Share of my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and being acquainted with all my Follies and
Extravagancies, ſhe often with an engaging and
perſuaſive Air, repreſented the diſmal State of
Want and griping Penury, which ſhe clearly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
muſt be the future Iſſue of my profuſe and
licentious Manner of Life; and as often with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Aſſurances of real Love and ſincere Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
warmly preſſed me to deſiſt, and leave my
vicious Courſes; but all her Tears and amicable
Admonitions prov'd abortive, and unable to curb
and reſtrain me in the full Career of my lawleſs
Paſſions, that blindly hurried me on to my utter
Ruin. However, to do her Juſtice, although ſhe
knew the Parties of whom I had borrow'd conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Sums of Money, and doubtleſs might by a
Diſcovery of my Affairs, been amply rewarded
by them; yet ſo extenſive was the Generoſity of
her Soul, that ſhe diſdain'd ſo vile and ſordid a
Practice, and deteſted and abhorred ſuch mean and
mercenary Views.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, I went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> with
my particular and worthy Friend Capt. L<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, his
Spouſe, and a young Lady a Relation of his. We
were very merry in our Journey, and during our
Reſidence there, we enjoyed all the Diverſion of a
rural Life, for having a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coach and four at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
we took the Benefit of the Morning Air
in the Park, and her Grace the Dutcheſs of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
being then in <hi>London,</hi> we frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
her Lodge, celebrated for its curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
Pieces of Painting; and in the Afternoon
drove to the antient College of Eton, fam'd for
Learning, and ſo eminent in the Numbers of bright
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0722300500:54"/>
and ingenious Gentlemen, who are deſervedly
deem'd the Pride and Glory of their Country;
Nor was the Caſtle unobſerv'd, that noble and
magnificent Structure, ſo much honoured with the
Preſence of our ancient Monarchs, and greatly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented
and embelliſh'd by various and bizarre
Figures, form'd in different Shapes, from Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
Arms, by the ingenious and artful Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
Here is alſo a beauteous Terras, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a delightful Proſpect of all the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and from whence the curious Spectators are
gratified with a View of the ſtately Cathedral of
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Love and Gallantry were
now the fole Topicks of our Converſation, and
the young Lady being ſingle, I made honourable
Propoſals of Love to her, with which neither ſhe,
nor the Captain or his Lady, were in the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.
In a Fortnight's Time we returned to
Town, and ſtopped at the St. <hi>Alban's</hi>-Tavern in St.
<hi>Alban's-Street,</hi> where we ordered a Supper and the
Footman to bring the Arms that we carry'd into
the Country for our Safeguard and Defence into
our Room. After Supper, we drank plentifully,
and Wine growing more potent than Reaſon, the
Captain (for variety Sake) would kiſs my fair Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
whereby I thinking my Property infring'd
oppoſed his Intent, upon which Words aroſe, and
the Piſtols lying on a Marble Slab in the Room,
we each of us haſtily ſnatch'd up one of them, and
preſenting, attempted to give Fire; but were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially
diſappointed in our Deſign, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and Care of the Footman, who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded
them, well knowing the capricious Temper
of his Maſter, when diſguis'd in Liquor. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0722300500:55"/>
Ladies were ſorely affrighted at this ſurprizing
Rencountre, and ſkream'd out, at which the
Landlord and his Drawers came in upon us, and
ſeeing us (for we had thrown down our Arms)
hard at it with our Fiſts, parted us, and calling two
Coaches ſent us home to our reſpective Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Next Morning when I awak'd, I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what had happened, and about Eleven the
Captain came to ſee me, then we went to take our
Mornings Draught, when, upon ſaying what
News, Sir? News, quoth he, my Wife tells me
that you and I were going to murther one another
laſt Night, on Miſs <hi>B<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi>'s Account, but I declare
upon Honour, that I knew nothing of it, and
ſince it was a mad Frolick, I'll engage the young
Lady to be at my Houſe this Evening, and ſhall
expect your Company there likewiſe. I punctually
obey'd his Orders, and we ſpent the Evening very
agreeably, all Strife and Contention gave Place
to Mirth and Gaiety: We aſk'd the Ladies Pardon
for putting them in a Fright, which they readily
granted, and Miſs <hi>B<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> with a pleaſing and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſe
Air, added, that ſhe had conceiv'd a much
better Opinion of herſelf than ſhe ever had before,
ſince two ſuch Gentlemen, at the hazard of their
Lives, had contended for her Favours; whereupon
bowing we returned the Compliment, and it now
growing late, I waited on Miſs Home. All Night
I was no more Maſter of my own Perſon, but
paſs'd the tedious Night rack'd with alternate Hope
and Fear. The next Evening, I ſent for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the Queen's-Head Tavern in <hi>Holhorn,</hi> and
there (to eaſe my Torment) diſclos'd my ardent
Paſſion; he Gentleman-like, in an open and free
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0722300500:56"/>
Manner told me that her Fortune was but ſmall,
and that too, in the Hands of thoſe who he feared
would not, without Difficulty, ſurrender it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſaid he, if you are upon honourable Terms,
I'll uſe my intereſt to bring Miſs to a Compliance.
Sir, ſays I, I ſhould think myſelf undeſerving of
that Frieudſhip you always profeſſed for me, ſhould
I even preſume to entertain the leaſt Glympſe of
a diſhonourable Thought for a young Lady any
ways releated to your worthy Family. Hereupon
the Captain well pleaſed with my generous Reply,
told me where her Uncle lived, and in a friendly
Manner adviſed me to apply to him, who being a
Gentleman of Fortune, if he approved of my
Propoſal, would inevitably compel her Guardians
to pay her Fortune upon the Marriage Day. Pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuant
to my Friend's good Counſel, I went to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſeemed very willing for the Match, and promiſed
his Friendly Aſſiſtance, for the Recovery of her

            <p>Nothing now remained, but the uſual Ceremony

thought was offered her, in preferring her Siſter's
Company to hers, when we went the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Journey. Being apprized hereof, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
it the Captain, and deſired him to uſe
his Endeavours to repair the Breach, and appeaſe
the young Lady's ſeeming Indignation. He at firſt
ſeemed to ſlight the Affair, as merely trivial and
frivolous, till ſeeing me very urgent and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
he then promiſed his friendly Aſſiſtance to
accommodate the ſeeming Difference, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gave the two Siſters and me an Invitation to
ſup at his Houſe. After Supper, he very genteely,
and with ſo much Prudence, excuſed both himſelf
and me, in the Choice of our Companion to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi>
that they were both highly pleaſed, and were
extreme good Company, particularly Miſs <hi>Fanny,</hi>
who was naturally of a more gay and airy Temper
than her eldeſt Siſter, and although ſhe had not
the fineſt of Faces, yet ſo graceful was her Air,
ſo eaſy and engaging her Behaviour, and ſo ſoft and
alluring her Voice, not ſtrained by Art, but by
the meer Effect of the laviſh Bounty of Nature,
that ſhe captivated the Hearts of all who had the
Pleaſure of her Company; upon the Captain's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
ſhe favoured us with a Tune on the Spinnet,
and to perfect the Muſick, joined ſo melodious a
Voice, that tranſported with Raviſhment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
I thought myſelf in Paradiſe. 'Twas then,
that I began to repent my Choice. Miſs <hi>B<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi>'s
Charms, once ſo prevalent, now appeared as mere
Phantoms and Illuſions, and <hi>Fanny</hi> reigned ſole
Miſtreſs of my Affections.</p>
            <p>However, as I thought it was not Prudence in
me to diſcloſe this ſudden Change, I behaved my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0722300500:58"/>

that fearing (as with juſt Reaſon I might) that

that valuable Art of Secrecy, placed an intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in me, and made me privy to all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
and lawleſs Pleaſures. This Intimacy of
the Father's gave Birth to the Daughter's Love,
that afterwards proved both her Ruin and mine.
She took all Opportunities of being in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and frequently ſtaid ſo late at my Houſe,
without the Leave of her Father and Mother, that
in a little Time it became the publick Talk of the
Neighbours, and almoſt the whole Town; and as
Fame is generally attended with Falſhood, ſome
there were that ſcrupled not to report, that I was
more familiar with her than was conſiſtent with the
Modeſty of her Sex; but this Accuſation (I take
God to Witneſs) was utterly falſe, for upon my
hearing that her Character and Reputation was ſo
ſo groſly injured, and that thoſe malicious Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
aroſe from the innocent Paſtimes with which
we amuſed ourſelves together, I acquainted my
Neighbour <hi>Brown</hi> with what I heard was current<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reported, concerning his Daughter and me, and
furthermore deſired him, as he tendered the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of his Child, to keep her away from my

But I who had no Thoughts of making her my
Wife, out of Friendſhip to her Father, ſcorned to
take Advantage of her Youth, nor ever anſwered
her Billet-doux, or went according to her Requeſt
to the Place of Aſſignation. In the mean Time,

upon the Hire of our Country Seat, and

About a Week after, I ſent down the Goods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               </gap>, an Accident happened to
me, that had like to have proved very fatal, but I
verified the old Saying, Nought is often in Danger,
but never hurt; for being three Parts mellow, and
mounted on a Golding of great Spirit and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
by my frequent tickling him with the Spur,
he in Spite of all I could do, ran away with me
till I came to Hackney River, where to puniſh my
Courſer for his Obſtinacy, and cool his Courage, I
clapped Spurs to him, and plunged him into the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0722300500:61"/>
River, down he fell, broke his Knees, and in the
Fall pitched me clear over his Ears, where for
ſome Time I could not recover myſelf; but by
good Fortune, at length I regained my Legs, and
kept puffing and blowing like a Porpice, till my
Companions came up, and ſeeing me in that pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Condition, diſpatched old <hi>Charon</hi> to take me
up, and waft me to the other Side of the Ferry,
whence like a drowned Rat I went dripping along,
ſtripped myſelf, and got half a Pint of Brandy
made hot, and went to bed, where I lay till my
Shirt and Clothes were dried by the Fire. In the
Evening I roſe, and returned to <hi>London,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
to the old Place of Rendezvous, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
Tavern, in <hi>Sheer Lane,</hi> where we paſſed the
Evening very merrily, but I reſolved for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
never to be guilty of the like Frolick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> thinking that
Abſence had ſufficiently abated the Warmth of his
Daughter's Affections, ſent for her home, and I
out of good Manners went to compliment Miſs on
her Return; but alas, her Abſence had only
ſerved to ſmother the amorous Flame, which by
frequent Interviews ſoon burnt with fiercer Rage.
In fine, one Morning the old Gentlewoman ſent
for me to Breakfaſt, and then propoſed very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
Terms of Marriage with her Daughter,
and urged me to a Compliance with very great
Warmth and Zeal. Furthermore to corroborate
her Argument, down came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Miſs <hi>Nancy,</hi> with her
Hair diſhevel'd, her Eyes flowing with Tears, and
her Dreſs careleſs and negligent. See, ſays the
Mother, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0722300500:62"/>
               <hi>Nancy</hi> is, how can you be ſo cruel and hard-hearted,
as not to return her Love? Come, come,
Neighbour Langley, I'll engage you'll have no
Occaſion to repent of your Bargain, Mr. <hi>Browne</hi>
and I ſhall never have any more Children, and
when we die, you'll come in for ALL. At the
Word ALL, which had a far greater Impreſſion on
me than what ſhe had ſaid before, I pricked up my
Ears, and ſeemed to hearken to her with Pleaſure,
and Nancy, who was before cruelly in the Dumps,
now began to revive, and put on the Air of Joy.
In ſhort, I told Mrs. Brown, that ſince it was an
Affair of ſuch great Conſequence, I muſt deſire a
Month's Time to conſider of it, and that then I
would give her my final Anſwer. Upon this ſhe
was well ſatisfied, and I took my Leave of them for
the preſent.</p>
            <p>Now I began ſeriouſly to conſider the State of my
Affairs, and finding by the private Accounts that I
kept in my Pocket Book, that the Payment of
thoſe ſeveral large Sums borrowed on Jewels of a
conſiderable leſs Value, than what I had fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
pledged them for, was within three Months
of its Expiration: I thought my Circumſtances in
a very melancholly Poſture, and my Caſe almoſt
deſperate, for if I ſhould not redeem thoſe Pledges
purſuant to Contract, my Credit and Reputation
would be entirely loſt; and on the contrary, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
ſince I had begun to play the villainous Part, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

there nothing now remained, but the Manner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0722300500:63"/>
effectually executing what I ſo fully intended, and
was ſo ſtedfaſtly reſolved upon. Marriage, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
with myſelf, would not only furniſh me
with a pretty Sum of ready Caſh, but would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
corroborate my Credit, and ſtrengthen my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
For as the greateſt Villainies are carried on,
and ſupported by the ſpecious Pretect of Sanctity
and Diſſimulation, ſo I thought it was but a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Suppoſition, that the Town now generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my frequent Debauches, would upon
my Entrance into the Connubial State, judge me
thereby reclaimed, and become a ſedate and ſober
Man. For this Reaſon, ſometime before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Marriage, I gave due Attendance at the
Romiſh Chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three Weeks Time I invited Mrs. Brown and
her Daughter to Supper, I told her, that upon a
mature Deliberation of her Propoſals, I was willing
to acquieſce and condeſcend thereunto, on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Terms, viz, That Mr. Brown ſhould be at
the Expence of the Wedding-Clothes, and pay the
ſtipulated Sum on the Morning of the Wedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day,
She readily agreed, and promiſed her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
punctual Compliance with my Demands.
Furthermore, as a Surety to bind the Bargain, I
gave the old Gentlewoman a Ring ſet with Roſe
Diamonds in Form of a Coronet, Nanncy was now
all Life and Gaiety, and by her Parents Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as mine, acted the Part of a Miſtreſs
in my Houſe, with the ſame Freedom and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
before, as ſhe did after the Ceremony was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
But alas, poor Girl, ſhe little thought
how ſhort her Reign would prove, and how the
Sunſhine of her Glory would ſpeedily be darkened
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0722300500:64"/>
and eclipſed by black impending Clouds that
threatened ſure, though not immediate Deſtruction
and endleſs Woe. But notwithſtanding this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
and ſolemn Contract with Nancy, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
my lawleſs Embraces with Clarinda, whom
I made my Counſellor and Confidant in the moſt
ſecret Tranſactions of my Life, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to ſatisfy my intended Spouſe, and pleaſe
her Parents, I turned her away ſoon after Marriage,
yet I frequently kept Company with her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and made her ſeveral conſiderable Preſents.
Mrs. Brown immediately purchaſed all Things
ſuitable for the Wedding, and alſo was ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent,
as to bring the ſeveral Patterns of Silks
and Laces deſigned for Nancy's Parapharnalia, to me
for my Approbation thereof. This Courteſy,
and the Richneſs of the Dreſs, ſo pleaſed me, that
I made her a Preſent of a Gold Watch and Chain,
and likewiſe a brilliant Diamond round-about Ring,
that ſhe might appear in the Faſhion of other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Ladies; and now the Licence being taken out,
and all Things ready for the Conſummation of
our Nuptials, Mr. Brown deſired me to ſix the
ſolemn Day, which he ſaid he ſhould chuſe on that
of his Birth Day. But I declined ſo ſpeedy an
Execution, on Account of a Tour I had promiſed
to take with ſome Friends, to a Gentleman's Seat
in Eſſex, and deſired the Marriage might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerred
for three Weeks longer, which Favour was
eaſily granted. And now all Things being agreed
on, I bethought myſelf of a Clergyman of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
a Gentleman void of a Living, and
reduced to a low State, greatly inferior to that of
his Profeſſion. Nevertheleſs he was a boon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0722300500:65"/>
told a merry Tale, and ſung a Song with
a good Grace, and by his Induſtry made a Shift to
get a red Face in the Service of the Church; for
having given my Word to this Gentleman, that
he ſhould be my ſacred Magician, whenſoever I
altered my Condition of Life, I thought myſelf in
Honour bound to perform my Promiſe therein. I
therefore ſent for him to the Bull Head in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-Inn-Fields,
where over a merry Bottle, I
acquainted the Doctor with my Intent, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
him to be ready on the Day appointed for
the Performance thereof. Having thus prepared
the Miniſter, I went down in the Country, and
after a ſincere and hearty Welcome, returned to
London on the Evening before our appointed
Nuptials, when after having drank a Bottle or two
with the Inn-keeper, where my Horſe ſtood at
Livery, I went to Mr. <hi>Browne's,</hi> who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a handſome Supper for my Reception, where
none were preſent but Captain <hi>H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>'s</hi> Lady and
our Family. After Supper Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> aſked me,
if I was provided with a Clergyman? Yes, Sir,
ſaid I, and he will be punctual to his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Gray's-Inn</hi> Chapel at Eight in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
well then, replied he, all's right, for I have
ordered a Coach and Four to be here at Seven, and
after the Ceremony we'll drive to <hi>Tim Harris's</hi> at
<hi>Egham.</hi> Agreed Sir, ſaid I, ſo taking my Leave
went home, where, according to Cuſtom, I lay
with <hi>Clarinda</hi> all Night. At Six in the Morning I
aroſe, and went to my Neighbour <hi>Browne's,</hi> where
they were all very buſy in preparing the new
Bride; he called me aſide, and aſked me whether
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0722300500:66"/>
I would have the Caſh before or after Marriage.
Before, Sir, ſaid I, by all Means; whereupon he
immediately complied with the Contract, by Notes
drawn on Sir <hi>Francis Child,</hi> and likewiſe gave me
the Writings of a Houſe belonging to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in <hi>Charles Court</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and afterwards
taking a Bottle of Rum out of his Corner Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
we drank all Health to each other. Now
the Bride being ready, we drove to the Chapel,
where my good Friend the Doctor was waiting, and
performed his Duty as a Gentleman worthy of his
Profeſſion. From Chapel we drove to <hi>Egham,</hi>
where an elegant Dinner was provided at Mr.
<hi>Browne's</hi> Expence, and to uſe the Words of the
ingenious Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> 'Naught but Mirth and

to Town, and I, regardleſs of my Spouſe,
mounted the Coach-box, and drove to the Queen's

we adjourned to my Father <hi>Browne's,</hi> where whilſt
the Men drank a Bowl of Punch, the Women out
of their pious Care, diſhed out the Bride in Bed,
fit for the Reception of her Huſband.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve that we were married on a Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and therefore I thought, if I could prevail
on my Wife (who was one of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)
to accompany me to Maſs on the Sunday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
I ſhould thereby gain the Applauſe and
Eſteem of all thoſe blinded Zealots. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I did not attempt out of a religious Motive,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0722300500:67"/>
but from a Thought of private Gain, hoping by
this well feigned Hypocriſy, to inſinuate myſelf
further into the good Graces and Eſteem of the
moſt eminent and wealthy Followers of that Faith
and Profeſſion. My Spouſe to oblige me, yielded
to my Requeſt, and her Condeſcention thereunto
had its deſired Effect; for a Merchant in Baſinghall-ſtreet
ſent for me next Day, and commending the
meritorious Act of making a Convert, favoured
me with Nine hundred and Seventy-five Pounds
worth of Silver on my Note, payable in a Month's
Time. This was a great Encouragement to me,
and ſerved further to facilitate my Deſign in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away as much in Debt as poſſibly I could.
Wherefore I reſolved to ſtrike while the Iron was
hot, and make as much of my Credit as Time and
Occaſion would permit. For the effectual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of which, I took up large Quantities of
Jewels of ſeveral Merchants, under Pretence of
diſpoſing of them to ſeveral Ladies, whom I had
the Honour to ſerve, and in three or four Days,
artfully returned them again, telling the Owners,
that the Ladies were not as yet come to a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
for the Purchaſe of them. I likewiſe took
up a Repeating Watch of one Mr. <hi>Vernon</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi>
the outſide Caſe whereof was ſet with large
Brilliants of the firſt Water, in Form of a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
Compaſs; betwixt the Hours and Minutes
were interſperſed ſome Brilliant Sparks, with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
Topazes, and various precious Stones of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Colours, reſembling the <hi>Iris.</hi> The Rims of
the Caſe were alſo ornamented with coſtly Jewels,
imitating the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, and on
the Top of the Spring, that cauſes the Movement to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0722300500:68"/>
ſtrike, was ſet a large Brilliant of the firſt Water,
The Chain was three continued Rows of Diamonds,
and on the Top of the Hook was a very large oval
Brilliant. In ſhort, it was the richeſt and moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Performance of that Nature, that had been
ſeen in <hi>Europe</hi> at that Time.</p>
            <p>This Watch I pretended was deſigned for the
Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and having the Honour to ſhew
it to ſeveral Noblemen and Ladies of the higheſt
Rank, I could have diſpoſed of it to them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I thought it would turn more to my Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to refuſe the Sale thereof, for this Reaſon, viz.
if I ſold it in <hi>England,</hi> the Owner would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the Payment thereof in a ſhort Time, and
on the contrary, it was not reaſonable to think that
he would refuſe to wait for the Return of foreign
Bills, if it was ſuppoſed to be ſent to her <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Majeſty. And now the Time drawing on for
the Execution of my full Purport, I made it my
Buſineſs to frequent Slaughter's Coffee Houſe in
St. <hi>Martin's Lane,</hi> where I ſoon got acquainted
with a Set of Foreigners, of whom I enquired into
the Laws and Cuſtoms of thoſe Countries relating
to broken Tradeſmen, that fled thither for Refuge
and Safety, and being aſſured by them that <hi>Holland</hi>
was the ſafeſt Azylum to ſkreen Villanies of that
Nature, I reſolved to ſteer my Courſe thither, and
therefore went to <hi>Bland</hi>'s on Tower Hill, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
for a Veſſel that would be ready to ſail in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Fortnight's Time. Upon Enquiry, I met
with one <hi>T<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s</hi>
Sloop, a Gentleman obſervant of his Word, if the
Wind and Weather permitted; with this Captain I
agreed for the Paſſage of two Perſons, to have the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0722300500:69"/>
Conveniency of his State Room and great Cabbin,
and gave him a Guinea Earneſt. The next Thing
I did was to get a Bill of Exchange for five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds, in the Name of <hi>Robert Clinton,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
payable to nim or Order, which being eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
I then applied myſelf to the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Merchants for their Jewels, pretending that
the Ladies were now come to a final Reſolution,
and would purchaſe them; and now the Prices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agreed on, I gave them my promiſſary Note,
three Months after Date for the ſame. All Things
being thus carried on with the utmoſt Secrecy, I
appointed <hi>Clarinda,</hi> whom I ſtill kept Company, to
be at the Prince William's Head at <hi>Charing. Croſs.</hi>
She was punctual to my Aſſignation, and there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mutual Aſſurances of conſtant Love and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable
Friendſhip, I acquainted her with my ſecret
Deſign, and inſiſted on her accompanying me in
my Voyage thither, and that upon her Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereunto, ſhe ſhould be an equal Co-partner
and Sharer of my large Fortune, which in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Probability, was ſufficient for our Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
in a polite and genteel Way, during the
Term of our Lives. But ſhe, like a generous
Girl, declined my baſe Propoſals, and in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
urged my being already married to a very
deſerving young Lady, whom in Honour I could
not leave, and that if ſhe conſented to my Proffer,
ſhe ſhould thereby deſervedly incur the Scandal of
the moſt vile and abandoned Adultreſs. In fine,
all the Arguments I could uſe were fruitleſs. So
having engaged her religiouſly to keep my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Secret, I took my Farewel of her; and then
reſolved, that ſince I could not obtain her conſent,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0722300500:70"/>
that I would take my Wife over with me, which
confeſs I did not ſo much out of pure Love, a
out of a View of Intereſt, hoping, that if I ſhould
be fruſtrated in my Deſign, that her Father, out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and intercept my intended flight. I likewiſe ordered
him to pay all ſuch trivial ſums as were owing to my
workmen.</p>
            <p>And now my ſpouſe and I having taken leave of
our parents, called a coach, and drove to the above-mentioned
place, where the chaiſe and four were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to my order. Then diſcharging the
coach, we went into the King's Arms, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted.
From thence we went to Graveſend, and put
up at the Faulcon, where I paid two guineas and an
half for the diſcharge of the chaiſe according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>On Sunday we dined with the captain, and other
gentlemen and ladies that were going paſſengers with
us. On monday morning the captain, according to
his promiſe heaved up his anchor with the wind S. W.
All the paſſengers with my ſpouſe went on board, but
I ſtaid aſhore till the captain went off, which was
nigh an hour after, and now the ſhip being adrift, lay
to for his coming on board. In the mean time as I was
drinking with my landlord in his back yard fronting the
water, I eſpied a one eye game cock, which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for half a crown, for a venture in Holland.
Now the captain having completed all his buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
hurried me and my new purchaſe on board, we
then braced about, filled our held ſails, and ſpread all
the canvaſs we could to the welcome gale, that freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on us, wafted our ſhip the next day to the Bombkays
at Rotterdam, where we went aſhore, and by the
commander's recommendation lodged at the ſign of the
Koning Van England, (or King of England's Head)
kept by one John Gadbury, on the Vine Haven.</p>
            <p>The next day captain J<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> came to dinner with

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0722300500:72"/>
things ſeemed to favour my undertaking, and I being
of a vain and aſpiring temper, reſolved to paſs for the
younger ſon of my lord F<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, and to the end that
I might make an appearance ſuitable to the dignity
that I had falſely aſſumed, I ordered a Taylor to make
me a rich ſuit of clothes; and as it happened, one Mr.
Loven, a decayed gentleman,, quartered at the ſame
inn with me, who ſpeaking the Dutch and French lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
to perfection, with him I contracted to be my
gentleman and interpreter, and to do him juſtice, he
faithfully executed the truſt I repoſed in him. This
gentleman I ordered to hire three French footmen, and
cloth them with the utmoſt expedition, with my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
which was blue cloth turned up with red, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
waiſtcoats and breeches trimmed with ſilver, and
broad gold lac'd hats. As to the coach, Mr. Laven
informed me, that it was cuſtomary in Holland for
all perſons of quality, except foreign miniſters, to hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being many grand and ſtately ones kept for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſettled my equipage and ſervants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the niceſt and richeſt fancy, I reſolved to devote
myſelf to pleaſure for ſome time; although in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
I privately enquired for a gentleman of worth

thoſe effects I had left in England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now I muſt obſerve, that upon my return to my
quarters, I frequently found the above-mentioned</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0722300500:73"/>
Captain in Company with my Spouſe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I took no Notice thereof, but on the contrary
always entertained him with the utmoſt Courteſy
and good Manners; but one Night, as we were in
Bed, I aſked her the Meaning of the Captain's fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Viſits, and whether he endeavoured to ſhew
a more than lawful Love and Reſpect for her.
Hereupon ſhe frankly told me, that ſhe believed
it was the Captain's Deſign to betray her Virtue,
for that he often expreſſed how paſſionately he
loved her; that therefore ſhe had uſed all poſſible
Means to avoid his Company, but found it a very
difficult Matter, which gave her cauſe to ſuſpect,
that he had bribed the Landlady to acquieſce in the
Purſuit of his Amours, wherefore ſhe earneſtly
requeſted me to provide freſh Lodgings, where ſhe
might be more retired, and ſhun the vile Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of the ſaid Commander: Well pleaſed with
this open and generous Confeſſion, I highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her Honour and Integrity, but deſired that
ſhe would not offer the leaſt Affront to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
I artfuly ſaid, until I could be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the Puniſhments inflicted on Perſons
in Adultery, by the ſevere Laws of the United
Provinces, Upon conſulting with my Gentleman,
who was well verſed in Statutes of that Republick,
I found that the Penalty on ſuch henious Crimes,
was immediate Forfeiture of all the Delinquent's
Effects, and cloſe Impriſonment during Life, as a
Satisfaction or Atonement to the injured Party, for
the Diſhonour.</p>
            <p>One Day, hearing that there was to be a Cock-fight,
I ordered one of my Servants to prepare
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0722300500:74"/>
mine, who had been for ſome Time in keeping, to
enter the Liſts, and by my Spouſe's earneſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
I took her (though contrary to the uſual
Cuſtom of the Ladies) with me, to ſee the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime.
In ſhort I backed my Cock againſt the
Oppoſers, and he, by good Fortune, at one chance
Blow killed his Antagoniſt, by whoſe unexpected
Death I was a Gainer of about ten Pounds. Highly
pleaſed with my Succeſs I returned home, and it
being Summer Time we ſeated ourſelves under a
ſhady Tree, that fronted the Inn Door, and called
for a Bottle of Claret, but had not been there long,
before the Captain came and joined us, and being
informed of my good Fortune, wiſhed me Joy. I
returned the Compliment, and <hi>Nancy</hi> with an Air
of Gaiety, deſired that I would favour her with the
Winnings for the Purchaſe of ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Toys; I
replied, With all my Heart, my Dear, for this and
all that I have is at your Service, and thereupon
immediately flung the Money into her Lap. Soon
after this, I ſaw her Countenance change, and ask'd
her what was the Matter? but ſhe made me no
Anſwer, whereupon Madam, ſaid I, what are you
dumb? This raſh and haſty Expreſſion ſo nettled
her, that ſhe threw the Money into the Street,
which I knowing the Value of better than ſhe, ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Nobility, where we dined in a ſumptuous
and elegant Manner, at the Sign of the <hi>Engliſh
Parliament,</hi> a celebrated Houſe for polite Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
From whence we returned to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi>
where I entertained the Captain and ſome of the
other Gentlemen with a grand Entertainment;
when the Company was gone, I uſed all poſſible
Arguments to perſwade <hi>Nancy</hi> to yield a ſeeming
compliance to the Captain's lawleſs Deſires, and to
appoint him purſuant to my Direction, a Place
proper for the Execution of his villainous Deſign.
Furthermore, I urged the great Advantage accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thence, and the diligent care and caution
I would take to ſurprize him, blaſted in the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Expectations of ſatiating his luxuriant and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Paſſion. But notwithſtanding all my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Nancy</hi> remained inflexible, and could not
be induced to acquieſce to this treacherous Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
and in her Defence urged, that no Lucre or
ſordid Gain (though ever ſo great) could expiate or
atone for that Diſhonour and Loſs of Character,
that ſhe muſt inevitably ſuſtain, by condeſcending
to ſo infamous an Act; wherefore I thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to drop an Argument ſo diſpleaſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to her, and to proceed to an Affair far
more weighty and important, viz. the Security of
my Perſon and Effects.</p>
            <p>For the effectual Performance of which, being
recommended to Mr. H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, a Man of Worth
and experienced Fidelity, that kept a large Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
on the <hi>Bombkays,</hi> to him I committed the
Charge of my Caſh and Jewels; and now finding
by his Diſcourſe, that he was well verſed in the
Laws of that Republick, and more particular in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0722300500:76"/>
thoſe relating to broken Tradeſmen that took
Sanctuary in thoſe Parts, him I judged to be the
propereſt Perſon to conſult and communicate with
about my own Affairs. Nevertheleſs I was not ſo raſh
as to let him into the Secret of my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
at the firſt Interview, but taking a Note of
him for the Re-delivery of my Caſh and Effects on
demand, I parted with him for the preſent, and
as ſoon as I came home, enquired more ſtrictly of
my Landlord, into his Character and Repute. Mr.

largely on his undoubted Veracity, and unbiaſſed
Fidelity to his Truſt, and at the ſame Time nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated

his Prudence and Sagacity, had been re-inſtated in

            <p>Theſe Words uttered with ſo much Warmth and

he promiſed by the Aſſiſtance of a Lawyer,

            <p>Charmed with his Diſcourſe, that inſpired me

Scarce had I read the Letter, before I was alarm'd

Landlord looking out of the Window, cry'd
Zounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, you are taken, my Houſe is now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded.
Be calm, Sir, ſaid I, and ſend up one
of your <hi>Dutch</hi> Servants to me, I'll change Habits
with him; alſo let me have a lighted Candle and a
Cork immediately. The Landlord obey'd my
Orders, I ſtript, put on <hi>Mynheer</hi>'s Habit, black'd
my Eye-brows, and paſſed out at the back Door,
unobſerved by any; from thence I went into the
Weod, where I lay hid until the Time appointed,
when Mr. H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> came, highly overjoyed to find
me eſcaped from the Fury of my Adverſaries.
Come, Sir, ſaid he, you muſt now perſonate the
<hi>Dutchman,</hi> and we will go to <hi>Vienna,</hi> a protected
Place, of ten miles in Circumference, where I will
obtain for you the Governor's Protection, and there
you may live ſecure and free from all Moleſtations
and Arreſts. This Scheme was no ſooner propoſed
than with Pleaſure agreed to, ſo from the Wood
we went into the next Town, and there hired a
Phaeton or Chaiſe for <hi>Vienna.</hi> In the Evening we
arrived there, and the next Morning waited on the
Governor, of whom for 50 Guineas I received the
Favour of a Protection, with a ſtrict Charge and
Caution not to exceed the Bounds of his Minute
Territories.</p>
            <p>The next Day Mr. H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> took his Leave of

I enjoy'd all Pleaſures, that a Place inhabited by

a ſufficiency of Caſh, the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

            <p>Hither came Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">

Weekly, and ſupplied me with what Caſh I
demanded, and aſſured me, that my Creditors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be out of all Hopes, and that if I patiently
ſubmitted to my Confinement for a ſhort Time,
that they would ſoon be wearied out, with the
large and extravagant Charges they were at, in
their vain Search and fruitleſs Purſuit. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I charged him to make my Wife as eaſy as he
poſſibly could, and let her know, that as ſoon as
the Storm was over, I would pay her a Viſit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
at the ſame Time, cautioned him not to let her
into the Secret of my Abode, leaſt peradventure,
thro' the Folly and indiſcretion of Youth, ſhe
ſhould inadvertently blab it out. <hi>Nancy,</hi> I muſt
obſerve to you, had near upon four hundred
Pounds by her, beſides her Jewels, Gold Watch,
and Snuff Box, ſo that I knew ſhe could not be in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0722300500:84"/>
any Want, and therefore made myſelf eaſy on that
Head.</p>
            <p>During my Stay here, I was taken violently ill,
which prevented my intended Journey to his <hi>Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
Majeſty's Dominions, whither I had deſigned
to go, and by preſenting my ſo-much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>amed and
celebrated Watch to his then favourite Lady, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
myſelf with the Hopes of obtaining a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in that great Monarch's Service. Dr.
W<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> was my Phyſician, who lived contiguous
to the Houſe where I lodged, and three Times a
Day viſited me, lying in a dangerous Condition in
my Bed, not able to move either Hand or Foot,
but racked with tormenting Pains both Night and
Day. My faithful <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> conſtantly attended
me, and for my Security brought Fire Arms into
my Room, leaſt the Governor being influenced by
a larger Sum, or ſollicited by their High Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
ſhould cancel or ſupercede my Protection,
and thereby expoſe me to the free Arreſt and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of my Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>One Night as I lay in my Bed, two of my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
came and ſurprized me in my Room, and
inſiſted on my going with them immediately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the Governor's Order to compel me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce
to their Demands; but I excuſed myſelf
on Account of my Illneſs for that Night, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be ready in the Morning, to comply with
their Requeſt. Nevertheleſs this Anſwer, was not
Satisfactory, for they inſiſted on lying in the ſame
Room with me, as a Guard to my Perſon. Here
upon my Comrades armed themſelves with a Brac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of Piſtols each, and preſenting, ſwore, that if the
Gentlemen did not immediately depart, that they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0722300500:85"/>
would ſeverely puniſh their Raſhneſs and Inſolence,
for they inſiſted on that Room being their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;
and that I was only there on Sufference.
Hereupon the Creditors withdrew, but placed a
Guard round the Houſe, ſwearing that they would
hurry me away with them very early in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Now the Fright I was in diſpelled all my Pain,
and I, who before could not move myſelf in my
Bed, now put on my Cloaths, and walked haſtily
up and down the Room, ruminating what Courſe
to take to extricate myſelf from this Emergency.
At laſt I ſent for the Doctor, who had already heard
of the Affair, and with him I agreed, that if he
would leave open his back Door, between the
Hours of Twelve and One, I would make my
Eſcape, and take Shelter in his Houſe.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe he readily conſented, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be punctual in the Execution of his
Truſt. Whereupon my Companions and I called
for Liquor plentifully, and I ſeemed to be no ways
concerned at the Danger I was in,</p>
            <p>Now the Time of my intended Flight drawing
nigh; we called for a large Bowl of Arrack Punch,
which whilſt the Landlady, (the ſole Perſon then
ſtirring in the Houſe) was making, I by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Obſcurity of the Night, eſcaped out at
the back Door, and ſlipped unſeen into the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
Houſe, where I lay concealed for nine or ten
Days, leaving my Purſuers to curſe their unhappy
Stars, and commence a freſh Hunt after their flown
Game,</p>
            <p>At length, growing weary of this intolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
I reſolved to venture abroad in diſguiſe, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0722300500:86"/>
therefore borrowed a ſuit of woman's apparel of the
Doctor's ſpouſe, in return for which I gave her a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond
girdle Buckle. The dreſs I had was <hi>French,</hi>
and therefore I was now obliged to play the part of
<hi>Madam de Paris,</hi> and for two or three days behav'd
very modeſtly among the ladies, being inſtructed in my
female diſcipline by the Doctor's ſpouſe. At laſt I ſet
out for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> having a gentleman of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
recommendation to perſonate my Husband; as
ſoon as I arrived there, I wrote to Mr. H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
him to remit me 200 Guineas, but he never
complied with my demand.</p>
            <p>Three days afterwards I received a letter from an
uuknown hand, aſſuring me that my Partner H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> had
proved falſe, and betray'd his Truſt to me; for
that he had actually agreed to deliver up all my ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
on promiſe of the above-mentioned reward;
that therefore the only expedient I had left to prevent
his villainous deſign was, a voluntary ſurrender of
myſelf. Whereupon, as the old ſaying is, Needs muſt
when the devil drives, I determined to make the beſt
of my way to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where I heard that my
creditors were aſſembled at Mr. E<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>, at the
Sun on the <hi>Vine-Haven,</hi> and by a voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to their mercy and clemency, to appeaſe their juſt
indignation, and thereby obtain that Reward that my
partner had by ſo infamous and treacherous a plot, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to gain.</p>
            <p>The deſign happily had its deſired Effect, for upon
my free ſurrender, the creditors not only uſed me in a
generous and gentleman-like manner, but ſent for Mr.
<hi>H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and abſolutely demanded all thoſe effects
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had lodged in his hands, threat'ning upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
thereof, to ſeize them by authority. In ſhort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0722300500:87"/>
he was obliged to comply, and produced all that eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
I had committed to his truſt, and at the ſame time
brought in a charge againſt me for caſh drawn out of
his hands, as likewiſe his bill for attendance and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
done for me, whilſt under my Misfortunes. The
gentlemen, as well as I, were greatly amazed at his
exorbitant demands, which were upwards of 700 l.
but nevertheleſs, to avoid further trouble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
they were adviſed to acquieſce to his exactions;
the laws of the united provinces being ſtrictly ſevere
in compelling all perſons to ſatisfy the parties by them
employed, to the utmoſt of their demands, tho' never
ſo immoderate. And now as a gratuity, the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
gave me the ſum of 200 <hi>l.</hi> enjoining me to be
ready to ſail with them for <hi>England</hi> on the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus accommodated, I went to my
old landlord's at the King's Head, but to my ſurprize,
ſound that my wife was gone from thence, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of the above-mentioned <hi>H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> who
had baſely perſuaded her to make a tour to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he ſaid I was ſettled. Upon a
further enquiry about her effects, the landlord told
me, that ſhe had honourably diſcharged the houſe,
and took her trunk along with her. However, I
made myſelf as eaſy as poſſible, under my unfortunate
circumſtances, but vowed to revenge myſelf on <hi>H<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
for the injury and injuſtice he had done me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I privately bought a pair of pocket piſtols, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and then went to his houſe to drink a glaſs
with him, under pretence of accommodating our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
tho' my full and real intent was to have
ſhot him, as an example to deter others from violating
the ſacred ties of friendſhip, by the horrid and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0722300500:88"/>
breach of truſt. But he (unable to bear the
reproaches of the populace) was gone, and ſo preſerv'd
his own life, as well as mine, which would have been
inevitably forfeited to the juſt laws of the Republic,
ſeverely rigid againſt homicide.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, my creditors and I returned for
<hi>England.</hi> On our arrival at <hi>London,</hi> we went to
Mr. <hi>Barnes</hi>'s, a goldſmith on <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> and one
of my principal creditors, who was generonſly pleaſed
to treat me better than I deſerved; at this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
houſe I lay all night, and the next morning was
carried to the Crown and Rolls Tavern in <hi>Chancery
Lane,</hi> where the Commiſſioners of the Bankruptcy
were aſſembled; here to my ſurprize, I met with my
wife and mother-in-law, both dreſſed in mourning, for
the death of their relation capt. <hi>Holden</hi>; when after
a civil ſalute, the old gentlewoman ſaid, <hi>Ah! Mr.</hi>
Langley, <hi>this Dreſs well becomes our preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,

Mr.</hi> Brown <hi>raves like a Madam, and will by no
Means be pacified, and</hi> Nancy's Dutch <hi>Landlord
has ran away with all her Caſh, Cloaths, and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
whilſt ſhe was in Queſt of you.</hi> Our further
diſcourſe was interrupted by an order from the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
for me to attend them immediately; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long and ſtrict examination paſſed, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of all parties, I was diſcharged, upon promiſe
of giving due attendance to the attorney for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and one of the aſſignees for my encouragement
thereunto, gave me five guineas in hand. After this,
I took an apartment for myſelf and wife, in <hi>Devercux
Court,</hi> near <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> and daily wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

aſſignees and their attorney, for the execution of the
then dependant buſineſs, viz. to ſettle my affairs, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0722300500:89"/>
cell in my debts, which were large, there being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of eighteen hundred pounds in the book, and my
plate and houſhold furniture was ſold for upwards of
twelve hundred pounds more. But amongſt all my
misfortunes, none ſo much grieved me as to ſee my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
library of books, that with pains I purchaſed
for two hundred and fifty pounds, diſpoſed of for
the trivial ſum of thirty pounds. And now my wife
being taken very ill, was removed to her mother's,
to be attended with all neceſſary care for a ſick perſon;
whereupon finding 5 s. per week too much for my fallen
circumſtances, to pay for a room barely to ſleep in, I
diſcharged the ſame, and took another at 1 s. 6 d. per
week in <hi>Hemlock Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the indiſpoſition of my ſpouſe, I was not
permitted to ſee her, being ſtrictly forbid the houſe by
her father. Wherefore having now ſettled the book
debts, and given an account of the reſpective abodes of
the different creditors, I reſolved to ſeek my fortune
abroad, hoping that upon my return, I ſhould find my
affairs happily concluded, and myſelf thereby maſter of
a great ſum ariſing from the Statute. Mrs. <hi>Brown</hi>
uſed her utmoſt endeavours to diſſuade me from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
but I remained inflexible, and deaf to all her
earneſt entreaties, and therefore muſtering up the ſum
of thirty Guineas, I went to the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
where I agreed with captain <hi>Joſeph Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
commander of the <hi>Frere</hi> Galley, bound for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned
iſland, for my paſſage thither. Upon
the captain's telling me that he ſhould be ready to ſail
in a fortnight, I prepared myſelf purſuant to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;
and having packed up my cloaths and linnen,
I took a final leave of my firiends, and went down to
<hi>Blackwall,</hi> where the Ship then lay, having given a

deſtitute of either Money or Friends; however, I
amuſed myſelf with ſettling the Accounts of one
Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> a yearly Trader to thoſe Parts, and
knowing no other Antidote to my preſent Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but Patience, I determined to bear up againſt
the Torrent of Adverſity, with a chearful Alcrity,
and pleaſing Hopes of ſome unectxpeed Turn of
Fortune.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day we went aſhore, and the
Ship's Doctor invited me to Dinner with him at a
Friend's Houſe, for every one by my Apparel,
judged me to be a young Gentleman of Fortune.
In the Evening I went to Mrs. <hi>Carmichael's,</hi> the
beſt Tavern in <hi>Charles Town,</hi> where I quartered for
a conſiderable Time; my good Friend Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
having given me a fair Character to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
and alſo preſented me with two Moidores,
for the Service I had done him, in ſettling his
Accounts; but this ready Caſh was ſoon expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I conſiderably indebted to my kind Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs,
which threw me in ſo a great Dilemma how
to manage my Affairs, that I could neither reſt
Night nor Day; full well I knew that I could not
get off from the Iſland without giving public No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof for one and twenty Days. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
as I had artfully lodged my Cheſt and Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at a little Tavern adjoining to the Water-ſide, I
waited in Hopes of ſome favourable Opportunity
of bilking my Landlady. Accordingly, ſome
Time afterwards his Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Goſport,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in the Bay, and by good Fortune, ſome of
the young Officers came to Dinner at my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where in the Afternoon, over a merry Bottle,
one of the Gentlemen aſked me, if I was not a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0722300500:92"/>
Commander, of ſome Veſſel, for ſo he judged me
to be my Apparel, which was Scarlet trimm'd with
Silver. Sir, ſaid I, my Appearance, I confeſs,
may ſpeak me to be ſuch as you pleaſe to imagine,
but to tell you the real Truth, I am the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
young Fellow alive, for here I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in Debt, which I am unable to diſcharge,
neither know I how to eſcape from this accurſed
Iſland. Sir, replied he briſkly, If that be all your
Grievance, I'll put you in a Way to redreſs it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;
our Captain is an honourable and good-natured
Gentleman, and therefore, if you apply to
him for your Paſſage, to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> I doubt not but
that he will eaſily grant your Requeſt; he comes
aſhore every Morning about Nine, and your beſt
Way is, to addreſs yourſelf to him on his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before he is engaged in other Company; in
the mean Time, be cautious how you let any one
into the Secret, and you need not fear Succeſs
therein. In fine, I heartily thanked him for his
wholeſome and highly agreeable Advice, and the
next Morning met the Commander, to whom I
freely without Reſerve, made known the State of
my Affairs, and he as generouſly was pleaſed to
promiſe me my Paſſage on Board the Ship, and at
the ſame Time, as a Signal, ordered me, when I
ſaw his Maintop ſail Sheets hauld home, to come
on Board, and he would receive me into his Care
and Protection.</p>
            <p>Highly pleaſed with this unexpected Courteſy
from a Stranger, I was not failing in an humble
and grateful Acknowledgement of ſo ſingular a
Favour, and elate with Joy, returned to my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Now my ſole Buſineſs was to keep a ſharp
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0722300500:93"/>
look-out for my ſo much deſired Signal; which
on the fourth Day I eſpied, to my great Joy and
Comfort; whereupon, I directly took a Canoe,
put my Cheſt therein, and went on Board. Captain
<hi>Richardſon</hi> ſeeing me go on board the Man of
War, imagined how Affairs went, and ſent his
Mate to me, with three Guineas, for the Whig
which I had had of my aforeſaid Friend the Barber
at <hi>Blackwall.</hi> From <hi>Barbadoes</hi> we ſailed to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi>
and during the Paſſage, I had the Honour
to Meſs with the Lieutenats, who ſeemed well
pleaſed at the merry Recital of my various Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
I leave my Readers to judge of the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that my Landlady was in, at the News of my
ſudden Departure, and now proceed to the Relation
of what happened to me in the above-mentioned
Iſland of <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I lodged at Mr. <hi>Wade's</hi> at <hi>Port Royal,</hi> and by
my coming there in the Man of War, paſſed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
for one of the Midſhipmen. Here in a ſhort
Time I expended my ſmall Stock, but was happily
prevented from running in Debt, by an unexpected
Accident. For one Night being at Supper with
ſome Gentlemen of the Iſland, one of the Company
gave me a kind Invitation to come over to his Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
near <hi>Salt-pan-Hill,</hi> there to ſpend three
Weeks or a Month with him in a retired Life. I
readily embraced the Opportunity, as hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to gain the Favour of being recommended to
ſome Employment on the Iſland. The next Day
we went to his Country Seat, far more reſembling
the infernal Regions, than the pleaſing Abode of a
Mortal here on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0722300500:94"/>
His numerous Attendants, both Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
were all Black, and their young, like Swine,
lay groveling in the Duſt. Here the parched and
yawning Earth brought to my Remembrance, how
Dame <hi>Tullis</hi> raiſed up her barren Head, invoking
<hi>Jove</hi> to cruſh the giddy <hi>Phaeton</hi> in his wild and
mad Carreer, and by his deſerved fall, to ſave her
vaſt Dominions from an univerſal Conflagration.
As this Gentleman had no <hi>European</hi> but myſelf to
Converſe, I ſoon became familiar with him, who
being acquainted with my Circumſtances, promis'd
to ſerve me to the utmoſt of his Capacity, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I here enjoyed all that the Iſland afforded,
yet a retired Life was not agreeable to my own
Diſpoſition; and therefore, I reſolved to uſe ſome
Stratagem to get a little Caſh of him, and then go
on board the Fleet commanded by Admiral <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
To effect this, I propoſed to live with this
Gentleman as his Servant or Overſeer, which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
after many Solicitations, and earneſt Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
was granted, and my deſigned Employment
was to overlook the Negroes in the Fiſhery. Now
as ſoon as Mr. <hi>Lynch</hi> (for that was the Gentleman's
Name) and I, had agreed on Terms for my Wages,
I freely told him, that my Cheſt and Cloaths lay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
as a Security for twenty Dollars at Port Royal, and
I moſt humbly entreated him to advance me Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for the Redemption of the ſame; to which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
readily conſented, and ordered his Negroes t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him a Letter to carry to his Maſter, the Contents
whereof were, 'That I returned him many Thanks
for his kind Entertainment, and generous Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
but that Fortune had unexpectedly provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſomething for me far ſuperior to the Station
of a Servant; that I hoped he would excuſe my
Breach of Promiſe, and that as to the Caſh, that
he had lent me, I would repay him as ſoon as
poſſible.' Having thus diſmiſſed the Negroe, I
forthwith addreſſed myſelf to the aforeſaid Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
who generouſly compaſſionating my Youth,
and Misfortunes, was pleaſed to order me on board
the ſame Ship that brought me thither, and the
Commander thereof, favoured me with the Liberty
of walking the Quarter Deck. In three or four
Days, the Fleet ſailed round for Port Antonio, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
on the Northermoſt Part of the Iſland, where
we continued near four Months, all Hands being
daily employed Aſhore, in building a Dock for his
Majeſty's Service. From whence we returned to
Port Royal, and after a ſhort ſtay there, our Ship
was ordered home to Plymouth, and there, ſoon
after paid off. Whilſt I was on board, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
an Intimacy with the Surgeon's Mate, and
we two now became inſeparable Companions, we
both lodging at the Three Guns at the Dock. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
the various Company that reſorted thither,
was an old Gentleman, Clerk of the Dock Yard, a
Man of an affable and engaging Temper, with
whom, as he daily frequented the Houſe, we ſoon
became acquainted. This Gentleman had a very
agreeable young Lady for his Daughter, with
whom, as ſhe accidentally came to call her Father
Home, my Comrade, the Doctor, was ſo ſmitten
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0722300500:96"/>

Mirth and Gaiety; the young Lady to heighter
our Pleaſures, diverting us with ſeveral Songs
Between Twelve and One we waited on our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
Home, and afterwards returned to our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where the Doctor was now more inflamed, his
Thoughts and Diſcourſe running continually on
the Perfections of his new Miſtreſs. But, for my
Part, I concealed my ardent Paſſion, and reſolved
to wait a more favourable Opportunity, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing
my Love and Eſteem, in an honourable
Manner, if ſo it may be called in me, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tied the Conjugal Knot. In the mean Time,
the Doctor and I (being both fluſh with Money) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
at large, till by our repeated Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
we had almoſt drained our Pockets, and in
return to our Folly, got the <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>However, one Day as we were playing at Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liards,
I looking out of the Window, accidentally
ſaw my Charmer ſtanding at the Door of a Corner
Shop; whereupon, giving the Game for loſt, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
ſaid I, there's Molly, come, let's go and drink
a Diſh of Tea with her; by no Means, replied he,
for the People of the Houſe are Strangers, and
conſequently would deem it Impudence in us to
force any Acquaintance with them. No matter
for that quoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, if you won't go, I will; ſo down

the Happineſs of drinking Tea with you, but
never till now had the Opportunity; ſo ſlipping
into the Shop, I told the Miſtreſs thereof, that I
hoped ſhe would excuſe my Freedom, in deſiring
the favour of her to make a Pot of Tea, and at the
ſame Time flung down Half a Crown as a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for her Trouble.</p>
            <p>She ſeemed very well pleaſed to have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of obliging her Couſin, as ſhe called her,

Parlour, whilſt ſhe prepared the Tea Equipage.
Here I freely diſcloſed my Mind to my lovely God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,
and met with a more favourable Reception
than I expected: ſoon after, in came the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who merrily ſaid, So, ſo, Mr. <hi>Englefield,</hi>

ſee that <hi>Molly</hi> and you are got together. Yes, Sir,
ſaid I, and ſince I have had the Pleaſure of
drinking Tea with Miſs, I deſire the Favour that
we may now go and drink a Glaſs together, for
I've ſomething to impart to you of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
Agreed to, Sir, replyed he, and you and
I will go firſt, and <hi>Molly,</hi> if ſhe pleaſes, may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

how paſſionately I loved his Daughter, and that I
ſhould be proud to make her my Wife: Whilſt we
were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Molly</hi> came to us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I ſhewed all poſſible Marks of ſincere Love
and Eſteem for her in the Preſence of her Father,
who invited me to breakfaſt with him next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
All this Time, my good Friend, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
was on Thorns, and longed to know the Reſult

            <p>As ſoon as I came to my Lodgings, I began
ſeriouſly to reflect on my paſt Folly in engaging
myſelf in ſo ſolemn and important an Affair, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Probability of effecting what I had ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
carried on with ſo much Succeſs; the ſole
Reaſon whereof was owing to my Imprudence;
for although I made a gay Appearance, yet I had
but ten Shillings leſt in Money, and moreover was
ſeverely pepper'd by the Favours of a Miſs I had
met with at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Wherefore on mature De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
of the Conſequences that muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ariſe from the Conſumption of my intended
Nuptials, I determined to viſit her once more, to
let her know, that, that I had received an Ordor
from my Friends to repair to London forthwith,
on ſome urgent Affair; but that upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0722300500:99"/>
thereof, I would return, and honourably
perform my promiſe. <hi>Molly</hi> ſeemed well enough
pleaſed herewith, but inſiſted on knowing how to
write to me, whereupon I told her to direct to
the <hi>Gun</hi> Tavern at <hi>Billingſgate.</hi> Now there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sloop ready to ſail that Day for <hi>London,</hi> my
Friend the Doctor and I, embark'd therein, and
landed at <hi>Tower</hi> Stairs.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing I then did, was to ſend for Mr.
<hi>G<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> to whom I related my Adventures, and
of him enquired into the State of the Bankruptcy:
Hereupon he told me, that Mr. <hi>L<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and the
Aſſignees, were involved in Law, and that no
Dividend had as yet been made, but ſays he, I
have two Guineas for you, that was leſt by your
worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> which I ſhould have
ſent to you on board the Ship that you went out
in, had I not heard that ſhe was ſailed before I
could poſſibly remit them to you. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>
has ſent your Wife to board in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but as to the particular Place I can't inform
you. I would therefore now adviſe you to lodge
privately on <hi>Southwark</hi> Side, where if you ſend
me a Direction, I will ſometimes call and ſee you.
Hereupon I took my leave of him, and went in
ſearch of an Apartment, which by good Fortune
I ſoon met with, agreeable to my Taſte, it being
in a Publick Houſe, where I had the Room <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
Near unto my Manſion lived a Mantua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker

that in a little Time her Virtue began to ſtagger,
and her Concupiſcence to be a Tiptoe. In ſhort,

               </gap>
ſucked in the deadly Poiſon of unbluſhing Vice,
and loſt what Impreſſions of Virtue and Honour I
had yet remaining.</p>
            <p>Here I continued near eleven Months, living
on the Spoils of the unfortunate, whom I uſed to
cheat and cozen at Cards and Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'till being
wearied of this long and tedious Confinement, I
entered into a Conſpiracy with two others, to take
the Opportunity when the Turnkey brought in the
unhappy Women of the Town at Night, to force
our Paſſage out; but this baſe Deſign was fruſtrated
by one of the Confederates turning Informer,
whereupon I was confined for four Days in the
ſtrong Hold, and afterwards moved by a Duce
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where (it being the Summer Time)
through the noiſome and filthy Stench of the Place,
I fell dangerouſly ill, whereupon my Friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating

paid for my Board and Lodging for three Months,
hoping that in that Time I ſhould get into ſome

            <p>One Day I chanced to meet <hi>John Gadbury,</hi> (my
former Landlord in <hi>Holland</hi>) who had ran away
with my Wife's Effects whom I dogged to his
Lodgings, and acquainting my Attorney for the
Commiſſion therewith, had him ſecured in the
<hi>Fleet,</hi> from whence after ſeven Months Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he made his Eſcape to the great detriment
of the Warden, who was obliged thereby to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy

ſat down together, where I uſed all poſſible Arguments
to eradicate theſe groundleſs Whimſies that poſſeſſed
his Brain; but all to no Purpoſe, for he remained
inflexible, and vowed Revenge on her. Wherefore
finding it in vain to reconcile the Difference, and
that I ſhould run in danger of my Life, if I continued
any longer in his Service, I propoſed a Separation,
to prevent any farther Miſchief, which he readily
agreed to. Now being deſtitute of all Buſineſs, I
lived on the Reverſions of a Proſtitute of the Town,
'till growing weary of that ſcandalous Courſe of Life,
I reſolved to go to Sea, and therefore applied to my

Habit of Life, that I could not quit the ruinous
Company of my Harlot, with whom I ſtaid in
Dalliances of lawleſs Love, till the Ship was

            <p>By this Imprudent Action I entirely diſobliged all

long as I could find Money. I was now in the utmoſt
Deſpair, and had there ended my Days miſerably by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0722300500:104"/>
hanging myſelf, had not the Rope unfortunately
broke.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Dod</hi>'s wife being ill, had lodgings in
the country, and his buſineſs often calling him out, I
was left in the houſe with only two women ſervants,
which made me reſolve to take the firſt favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of making my eſcape, neither was it long
before I effected it; for one day as <hi>Dod,</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
were gone to <hi>Kentiſh Town,</hi> I ſent the old
woman out for a quart of gin, and ply'd her ſo
cloſe with that intoxicating liquor, that ſhe ſoon fell
faſt aſleep. As to the young one, I elevated her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
with ſack and walnuts, till by amorous toys,
and merry waggiſh tales, I prevailed on her to grant
me the favour of ſtanding at the ſtreet door for the
benefit of the air. In the interim came by a barrow
of peaches, whereupon, come, my dear, ſaid I, will
you eat a peach? ſhe replying, yes, ſir, I gave her
ſixpence to purchaſe ſome of them, but did not ſtay
to partake of the remainder, for I immediately ran
down to <hi>Temple</hi>-ſtairs, and croſſed the water, where
I lay perdue at the houſe of one <hi>L<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of mine, who employed me to make handles for
bruſhes, and afterwards recommended me to Mr.
<hi>Weed,</hi> a colourman, who had built a Shed in a
field remote from all houſes, where he boiled his bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock's
blood, an ingredient uſed amongſt them in the
compoſition of blue. This retired life, attended with
a noiſome ſtench did not long agree with me, and
therefore I reſolved to ſell myſelf for a four year's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
Accordingly I contracted with one <hi>Burge,</hi> who
ſent me on board the <hi>Spaniſh Town</hi> Factor captain
<hi>Gray,</hi> bound to <hi>Jamaica.</hi> In my paſſage I ſettled the
captain's books, who ſold me for a ſchool-maſter
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0722300500:105"/>
to Colonel <hi>Sands</hi> at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> who having a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
at <hi>Saltpan-Hill,</hi> removed me and his children
thither, for the better conveniency of their education.
Here I continued near three months, frequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
myſelf in the company of one <hi>Quimino,</hi> a
facetious and truſty negroe ſlave, belonging to my
maſter, till growing weary of the mean and poor
diet I met with there I reſolved at all events to run
away; and accordingly about four in the morning,
I went privately to <hi>Paſſage Fort,</hi> but had not got
into the boat that was to carry me to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> before
I was purſued, overtaken, and conducted back. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this, I ſtill remained obſtinate, and inſiſted
on going to the colonel's at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> which being
agreed to, I loudly exclaimed againſt the ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I had met with, and plainly told him, that I
would ſerve him no longer; which ſo exaſperated the
colonel, that he threatened to have me whipt by his
negroes. Enraged at this menace, I ſwore that
nothing leſs than his life ſhould expatiate the groſs
affront; whereupon he finding me ſo reſolute, remanded
me to my former captain, with whom (he having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
one of his hands) I returned to <hi>England,</hi> and
in the <hi>Downs</hi> was preſſed by his majeſty's ſhip the
<hi>Portland,</hi> from whence I went to <hi>Ilvercomb, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi>
and <hi>Bath,</hi> and rambled up and down the country
with my comrade, who was one of our corporals o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

board, till having expended all our caſh, we made
the beſt of our way to <hi>London,</hi> taking the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of paſſing for ſea-faring men caſt away in the
<hi>Lamb,</hi> captain <hi>Morgan,</hi> bound for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with
the tranſport ſoldiers; by which falſe pretence we
obtained great relief on the road. When we came
to <hi>London,</hi> we lodged in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s, at one of thoſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0722300500:106"/>
mean and ſcandalous houſes, that harbour ſtrangers
for two pence a night. But this life not being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to either of us, I perſuaded my companion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a ſoldier in the foot guards, and for my part
I ſold myſelf once more to go to <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
on board near a week in the river; but there
finding indifferent uſage, and ſearing to meet with
worſe at ſea, I ſtole aſhore in company with a weaver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who was likewiſe going on the ſame fooliſh errand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
From thence we travelled to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
ourſelves to be <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> we were r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lieved
by the Proteſtants of that town, and then continued
on our journey to <hi>Dover,</hi> where by good fortune we
met with captain <hi>Jennings,</hi> who gave us our paſſage
to <hi>Calais.</hi> At my landing there, I was ſolicited by
by ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> officers to enliſt into the <hi>French</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but would by no means agree to their propoſals.
My companion now parted from me in ſearch of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
but I entered myſelf on board a ſnow, loaded
with corn, and bound for <hi>Liſbon.</hi> At <hi>Calais,</hi> we
ſtaid ſeven weeks, in which time the captain and
all the crew were ſo involved in debt, that we
were obliged to put to ſea in the middle of the
night. When we arrived at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
was turned out of his employ, and we all
paid off.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet lying there, I had ſome
thoughts of entering on Board thereof, but was
prevented by Meſſr. <hi>Ibraham</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Gueſt,</hi>
who kept a large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with me ſor ten Pounds per Annuum to ſerve them
in the Capacity of a Drawer. Here I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that I lived upon the beſt that the City af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
and each of my Maſters keeping a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0722300500:107"/>
Lady of Pleaſure, I likewiſe grew wanton,
and maintain'd a Miſs for myſelf; but as this
Courſe of Life could not be ſuppoſed to have any
long Duration, my Maſter ſoon fail'd, and I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
was obliged to ſeek out for a freſh Service.
Hereupon I ſhipp'd myſelf with Captain <hi>Brook,</hi>
Commander of the <hi>Sarah</hi> Galley, bound to <hi>Sancta-Cruz,</hi>
in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cadiz</hi> and
ſo home to <hi>England</hi>; but the Captain and I not
long agreeing together, I ran away from her at
<hi>Cadiz,</hi> from thence, (after I had involved myſelf in
Debt) I made the beſt of my Way to <hi>Malaga</hi> by
by Land, all through the Province of <hi>Andaluzia.</hi>
In my Journey, I was greatly ſurprized at the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and extreme Miſery of the Inhabitants,
chiefly owing to their Bigottry, they ſcarcely hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bread to eat whilſt the pretended Religious are
pampered up in the moſt exuberant Luxury.</p>
            <p>When I arrived at <hi>Malaga,</hi> I lodged at one <hi>O'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Brian</hi>'s
almoſt a Month upon Credit, but finding
at laſt cold Reception, I reſolved to apply myfelf
to the Clergy, who I knew full well were the only
Perſons for me to work on, and having obſerved
that it was cuſtomary for ſome of them to frequent
the Sea-ſide daily; I ſeated myſelf there on a Stone,
and in a melancholy Poſture waited for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor was it long before two of the Dominican
Order came, and ſeated themſelves by me, asking
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue, what Countryman I was?
I replied in <hi>Latin,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>; whereupon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their fooliſh Notion, deoming me no
Chriſtian, and therefore incapable of Salvation,
they out of their ſeeming Piety, invited me to
their Convent, there to be inſtructed in their Faith.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0722300500:108"/>
In ſhort, I verify'd the old Proverb, <hi>Neceſſity has
no Law</hi>; for being then almoſt ſtarved, I was glad
to embrace any thing that offered for my imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Relief, and pretending to be entirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Principals, I paſs'd on them for
a great Proficient therein. Here I liv'd a retir'd
and indolent Life near four Months, during which
Time they often preſs'd me to the Acceptance of
the Habit, which I always declin'd, as having an
Averſion to their ſuperſtitious Follies, though by
them artfully contrived to impoſe on the giddy
Vulgar. Theſe Fathers recommended me to the
Service of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobleman, in Quality of Page
to his Lady, with whom I liv'd eleven Months, till
being unfortunately diſcover'd in an Amour with
his Niece, whom I had debauched, and was forced
to ſkreen myſelf from the Rage of the injured
<hi>Don,</hi> by leaping out at the Window, and making
the beſt of my Way to the Houſe of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of my Acquaintance, where I lay concealed
for a conſiderable Time, till at length meeting
with a Sloop bound to <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> I entered on Board thereof, our Paſſage
was unparallell'd, and hardly credible, for we were
thirty-five Days before we got into the Bay at
<hi>Gibralter,</hi> which from <hi>Malaga,</hi> is but eighteen
Leagues diſtant. Wherefore thinking that ſuch an
uncommon and unuſual Diſappointment, portend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſomething fatal attendant on our Sloop. I there
quitted her, and offered myſelf as a Soldier in the
Garriſon, but was rejected, by the Followers of
<hi>Mars,</hi> on Account of my Stature, whereupon
having nothing to ſubſiſt on, I was forc'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the diſagreeable and ſlaviſh Part of a Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0722300500:109"/>
to the <hi>Bricklayers,</hi> which I thought was the
greateſt Hardſhip that I ever yet met with, and
therefore I reſolved to quit this intollerable fatiguing
Service, and ſeek out for ſome other more facile.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I applied my ſelf to the <hi>Tennis-Court,</hi>
and ſerved therein as a Waiter; but that
likewiſe did not anſwer my Expectation, for my
Miſtreſs, on Account of the wet Seaſon, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much Company as uſual, put me to fetch
Water from the Fountain, and clean the Hogſties,
which ſervile Employs not conſiſting with my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Life, I quitted her Service, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
Uſher to a School-maſter, who not living
within the Bounds of his Scholaſtical Revenues,
was in a little Time compelled to quit the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
            <p>I now thought I had a fair Expectance of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
him in that Occupation, but my Hopes
therein prov'd abortive, through the Malice of ſome
envious Perſons, who repreſented me to the then
Governor (General <hi>Sabine</hi>) as a Perſon ſent thither
as a Spy, though in Diſguiſe; whereupon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
ordered me to be confin'd in the <hi>Moor</hi>'s
Caſtle, and in a noiſome and filthy Cell, where I
continued for the Space of ſeventeen Days; at the
Expiration of which I was releaſed and turned out
of the Garriſon. Whereupon I ſhipp'd myſelf as
<hi>Cook</hi> on Board a <hi>Tartan,</hi> commanded by one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
Jenkins,</hi> bound for <hi>Walidea,</hi> on the <hi>Barbary</hi>
Shore. We went out in our Ballaſt, with four
<hi>Mooriſh</hi> Merchants on Board, that were to freight
our Veſſel with Corn, and then return to <hi>Gibralter,</hi>
for the Sale thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0722300500:110"/>
But the Maſter, either through his Ignorance, or
adverſe Winds, could not gain his deſired Port;
but kept buſking the Sea, till our Proviſions were
almoſt expended, and we reduced to the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of three Pound of <hi>Barbary</hi> Ruſk per Week,
and half a Pint of Water a Day. Theſe Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
with the ill Treatment of the Maſter, made
me reſolve to leave him as ſoon as poſſible, and
ſoon after it luckily happen'd that I had an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of effecting what I ſo much deſired, for in
a - hard Gale of Wind we ſprung our Maſt, and
tore our Sails to ſhatters, but at length the Storm
abating, we the next Day made the <hi>Canary-Iſlands,</hi>
when putting her before the Wind, under an old
ſpare maintop Sail, that we had on Board, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor'd
about eight at Night at the <hi>Colerada</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Iſland of <hi>Lancerota</hi>; our Captain
being afraid to go into the uſual Port of that Place,
left his Hands, who had been all barbarouſly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, ſhould run aſhore and leave him. Now
reſolved to looſe no Time in freeing myſelf
from this Slavery, and therefore about Twelve o'
Clock at Night, my two Confederates and I, after
we had taken three Pieces of Linnen, and what
elſe we could find, from the <hi>Moors,</hi> embarked in
the Boat, and went aſhore, making the beſt of
our Way from the Sea Side, though we knew not
whither it led to. About the Dawn of Day we
met with a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> mounted on a <hi>Bourico,</hi> or
Jack-Aſs, who civilly bidding us Good-Morrow,
aſked for an old Pipe, whereupon, I having the
Language at Command, returned the Compliment,
and favour'd him with one half full of Tobacco;
whereat he expreſſed a great Satisfaction, and at
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0722300500:111"/>
the ſame Time gave me to underſtand, that he was
Mayor of that Town, which we then ſaw on the
Hill. I confeſs that by his mean Garb, and
wretched Appearance, I had formed a deſpicable
Idea of the reſt of the Inhabitants, which was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
augmented at the Sight of their poor ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
Huts, and miſerable manner of Life; their
common Diet being Greens and Oatmeal, mixed
with cold Water, which they call <hi>Goſio</hi>; neither
do any of the Inhabitants, except the Grandees
and Clergy (altho' the Iſland affords plenty of
Corn) ever bake any Bread for their own Uſe.</p>
            <p>In the Evening by the help of our Guide, whom
we hired for two Reals of Plate, about a Shilling
Value, we reach'd the Port, where ſtood ten or
twelve ruined Houſes, with only one which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in tollerable good Repair, which upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
we found was the Manſion Seat of Seignor
<hi>Don Bernado Trojano Cocillio de los Eſperones,</hi> the
Perſon who aſſumed to himſelf the Title of the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſul; to this Gentleman we complained
of the ill Treatment that we had received from
our Commander, repreſenting him as no Chriſtian,
but as an Encourager to <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> and to
prove our Aſſertion, we declared, that he had
four <hi>Moors</hi> on Board.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we made him appear ſo black in the
<hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Eyes, that he thought him a mere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
often ſigning himſelf with the Croſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at the
mention of his Name. Whereupon he commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
our Hardſhips, and entertained us very
handſomely for three Days: To this Gentleman
we ſold our Linnen Cloth for 40 Dollars, but not
thinking it ſecure to make any longer Stay here,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0722300500:112"/>
leaſt the Captain (who without Diſpute would come
in Search of us) ſhou'd on his Appearance confute
our Aſſertions, and thereby making us appear
greater Villains, than what we had repreſented him,
and obtain an Order to have us bound Neck and
Heels, and carried on Board, where we could expect
no Mercy from him, or the injured <hi>Moors,</hi> we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
went privately in the Night to the Place called
<hi>la Valla,</hi> the Reſidence of the Governor, where
ſtood two Convents, one of <hi>Dominican,</hi> and the
other of <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryars, where we took Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,
my two Comrades in the latter, and I in the
former Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>The Priors of the reſpective Orders, treated us
very handſomly, and promiſed to ſecure us from
all Danger, if we kept in the Confines of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
Territories. We had not been long here,
before the Captain came up to the Governor's, and
upon Complaint, that he could not put to Sea
without his Hands, obtained of him an Order to
apprehend us, if found without the Limits of the
Convents, it not being in his Power to take us out
of the Pale of the Church. Hereupon the Captain
endeavoured by Flattery, to perſuade us to return
on Board, but all in vain, for we not only reſolved
to continue in our Station, but alſo to do him all
the Prejudice we cou'd; and therefore I drew up a
Complaint to the Governor, and prevailed on the
Prior to preſent it to his Excellency, ſetting forth
our barbarous Uſage; and that the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
had <hi>Moors</hi> on Board, who under Pretence
of Traffick, came to take a View of the Iſland,
in order to return with Force, and ſurpriſe the
Inhabitants. This ſo incenſed the Governor, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0722300500:113"/>
he ordered a Company of Soldiers on Board, to
ſearch the Veſſel, and to oblige the Captain to
pay 334 Dollars as a Fine for not anchoring in
the open Port; and furthermore, to put to Sea
in ten Days Time. All which he unable to reſiſt
their ſuperior Power, was obliged to comply
with.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was ſailed, we ranged through
the Iſland at our Liberty, and were civilly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Natives, in the beſt manner they
could afford. My Companions went on Board a
<hi>Genoeſe</hi> Veſſel, but I waited for the Arrival of the
Father Provincial, well knowing that if I had the
Fortune to get into his good Graces, that it would
turn conſiderably to my Advantage; wherefore on
his Arrival there, I play'd my Cards with ſo
much Art and Cunning, that I ſoon obtained the
Favour of waiting on his Perſon, who I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
treated me with the utmoſt Humanity.
With him I went to <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> another of the
<hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, where I continued in the ſame Poſt;
but altho' I never wanted for the beſt of Victuals,
nor Cloaths, nevertheleſs ſeeing no Proſpect of
getting Money in his Service, (the Clergy of that
Profeſſion being generally much addicted to the
inordinate Love thereof) I left him, and from
thence proceeded to the Port of <hi>Oratava,</hi> where
for ſome Time I was maintain'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchants; but as Courteſies of that Nation are
not of any long Duration, I was ſoon obliged to
Ship myſelf on Board the <hi>Charming Molly</hi> Captain
<hi>Patrick Mackhugh,</hi> bound to <hi>Genoa,</hi> where we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded
onr <hi>Orchilea,</hi> (a Weed uſed by the <hi>Dyers</hi>)
and after about a Month's Continuance there, we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0722300500:114"/>
loaded with Bale Goods for <hi>Cadiz.</hi> And I now
waiting on the Captain, I had an Opportunity of
ſeeing the Directions of the ſeveral Letters that he
brought for the numerous Merchants of that City,
and amongſt them I found one directed to Meſſrs.
<hi>Ryan</hi> and <hi>Mannock</hi>; whereupon knowing Mr.
<hi>Mannock</hi> to have been my old School-fellow, and
familiar Companion when in Trade, I reſolv'd to
wait on him, and therefore aſked the Captain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to go aſhore, where I ſecreted myſelf all
Night in a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Houſe, and the next Morning
waited on my worthy Friend, who aſked me
<hi>What Service could he do me?</hi> To which generous
Offer I reply'd, <hi>Sir, pleaſe to obtain my Diſcharge
from the Commander.</hi> Whereupon he immediately
gave me a Note to the Captain for that Purpoſe;
yet he abſolutely refuſed to diſcharge me, and the
next Day ſailed for St. <hi>Lucan,</hi> to load with Fruit
for <hi>London,</hi> leaving me behind. Mr. <hi>Mannock</hi> (as
my Wages were but trivial) adviſed me not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
myſelf about them, but ordered me to take a
Lodging, and come to Dinner with him every
Day, untill he could procure my Paſſage to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in a Gentleman-like manner; he enabled me
beſides to quit my Seaman's Garb, and gave me a
genteel Suit of his own, with Shirts, Hat, Wig,
&amp;c. and 20 Piſtoles in my Pocket.</p>
            <p>Now I began to taſte the Pleaſures of Life once
more and buried all my former Hardſhips in Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion;
yet ſtill I obſerved a regular and ſedate
Conduct for fear of diſobliging my generous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron;
till one Night in the <hi>Carnaval</hi> Time I unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
picked up a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady, with whom I
went Home, and ſpent the Evening in lewd Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0722300500:115"/>
ſures, and as I was returning Home thro' a dark
Paſſage, my Hat and Wig were ſnatch'd from off
my Head, and at the ſame Time a Book that I
had borrowed of my Friend was pick'd out of my
Pocket. The Place was ſo dark and obſcure, that
I could not diſcover the Villain, who fled as faſt
as he could, and ſoon ſkreen'd himſelf from my
fruitleſs Purſuit.</p>
            <p>It is oftentimes very Dangerous for Strangers
at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and many other Places in <hi>Spain,</hi> to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Houſes kept by Courtezans, becauſe there
are frequently, if not always, Fellows who reſort
thither and make their Prey of poor Sailors, and
others, who are ſo unfortunate as to go thither.
They watch every Perſon very narrowly and are
ſure to make ſomething of them; for if they
have not an Opportunity of robbing you in the
Houſe, you are ſure to be met, and plundered
as you return home to your Quarters; and many
Times <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sailors have been ſtabb'd in dark
Places in that City a cruel Inſtance of which
happened during the Time I tarried there.</p>
            <p>A young Fellow, an Iriſhman, Clerk to the
Captain of the <hi>Cales</hi> Factor, (for <hi>Cales</hi> is more
frequently uſed by Mariners than <hi>Cadiz</hi>) being
returning from a bad Houſe, where he had idly
ſpent two Days and Nights with lewd Women,
and ſquandered away a great deal of Caſh, he was
attacked in the Dusk of the Evening by ſome
Aſſaſſins, who barbarouſly murdered him, after
they had taken all his Money, and even ſtript all
the Cloaths from off his Back; and I never could
hear that theſe Ruſſians were ever detected, tho'
the Britiſh Conſul and the Commander of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0722300500:116"/>
to which the Youth belonged, publiſh'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for apprehending them; and the Governor
of <hi>Cadiz</hi> did all he could to bring them to Juſtice
and Puniſhment; but all the Searches that were
made by the Officers of the City were ineffectual,
and the Rogues were never found out, as I ever
heard of.</p>
            <p>This unhappy Affair however, put moſt of
the Britiſh and Iriſh Seamen on their Guard, who
rather choſe to tarry on board their reſpective
Ships, than hazard their Lives on Shore among
ſuch abandoned Wretches as the Courtezans, and
the Villains who reſort amongſt them, who act
much in the ſame Manner as Bullies do to the
common Proſtitutes who ply in <hi>London</hi> Streets,
but with a good deal more Caution, for fear of
being clapp'd up in Priſon, from which they are
ſeldom or ever diſcharged, without being fined,
and corporally puniſhed. But, to return to my
own Story.</p>
            <p>Stung with Remorſe, not ſo much I confeſs for
the Offence, as for the Loſs I had ſuſtained; I
went Home greatly perplex'd, how to prevent
this ſad Diſaſter from reaching my Friend's Ear,
which full well I knew I cou'd not effect but by
procuring the Book the ſole Obſtacle to the
Concealment of my paſt Folly; but Mr. <hi>Mannock</hi>
had unfortunately heard of the Affair by the Book
being expoſed to Sale; wherefore at Dinner he
aſked me for the ſame, ſaying, <hi>That he highly
eſteemed it, as being a preſent from his Brother to
him.</hi> I bluſh'd, and after Dinner called him aſide,
freely acknowledged my Fault, and humbly begg'd
Pardon for the Offence, which he generouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0722300500:117"/>
but cautioned me to beware of the like
Folly for the future. I now reſolved, (ſince my
Friend was acquainted with the Amour) to make
the Harlot (whom I ſuſpected to be an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice
in the Robbery) to render me an ample Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the Injury received, and therefore I
made my Complaints to the Alcade Major, or
Mayor of the Town, who order'd two Officers to
go with me to the Houſe, and to demand the
Goods I had loſt; and if the Proſtitute refuſed to
deliver them, to ſeize her Effects, and carry her to
Priſon. In ſhort the Huſſy to prevent the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
Storm returned the Things, and as an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
for her Crime, gave the Officer and me
a Dollar a-piece, and a handſome Treat.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Cadiz,</hi> I had an Opportunity of keeping
Company with ſome Spaniſh Sea Officers, and
other Gentlemen of Faſhion, who finding me a
Man of tolerable Capacity, took ſome Pains to
inſtruct me in the Spaniſh Language. Many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have mentioned the Multiplicity of Titles
uſed by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but without having
perfect Knowledge of them, and therefore I will
here give them my Readers.</p>
            <p>He is ſtiled King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>

and Continent of the Ocean, Arch-Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0722300500:118"/>
Earl of <hi>Flanders Tirol</hi> and <hi>Barcelona,</hi> Lord of
<hi>Biſca</hi> and <hi>Molina, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been in the City of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which is a
very antient one, and was built by <hi>Barea,</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenian,
200 Years before Chriſt, has a ſafe
Harbour on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> is large, well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd,
and ſecured by a Caſtle without it, called
<hi>Mount Jovi.</hi> It was well built before the French
Siege in 1688, which ruined many ſtately Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the Inhabitants were rich. Into this
Place the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put all their Foot, under the
Command of the Prince of <hi>Heſſe Darmſtadt.</hi> The
<hi>French</hi> opened their Trenches, and carry'd them
on with extraordinary Vigour, though much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded
by bad Weather, and the continual Fire of
the Beſieg'd. At the ſame Time the <hi>French</hi> Fleet
riding before the Harbour threw in abundance of
Bombs. The Garriſon made ſeveral great Sallies,
in which many Men were killed on both Sides,
but yet they were always repulſed, and had not
their intended Effect. Yet the Beſiegers had no
great Reaſon to rejoice in their Succeſs, for being
too few to encloſe the City, it was daily ſupplied
from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army that lay hard by. <hi>Vendoſme</hi>
(the French General) underſtanding that it was
concerted to attack him by way of a general Sally,
and from both the Vice Roy's ſmall Camps, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to prevent them, and therefore leaving a
ſufficient Force to ſecure his Works, he marched
himſelf with one Part of his Army, ſending the
the Sieur <hi>d'Uſſon,</hi> with the other in the Dead of the
Night, and ſurprizing both the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camps,
put all to the Rout, killing many, and dronwing
many more, who endeavoured to get over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0722300500:119"/>
               <hi>Lobregat,</hi> taking all their Baggage, among
which was the Vice Roy's, in it a Box with 22000
Piſtoles, and 700 Horſes and Mules. This Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
encouraged the Beſiegers, who ſprung two
Mines under two Baſtions, and lodg'd themſelves
on them, though with the Loſs of many Men,
and having blown up other Mines, and made a
conſiderable Breach, at laſt the Garriſon capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to march out the 15th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Manner, and be conducted to Tarragona.
It was reported that this City coſt the French
12000 Men, which indeed ſeems incredible, but
very many died of Sickneſs. The Bombs thrown
in by the Fleet had deſtroy'd above half the Town,
but when I was there, it appeared like a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
City.</p>
            <p>The trade at <hi>Cadiz</hi> is far more extenſive than
that of any other port belonging to the Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
either in Europe, or elſewhere; the galleons
and flotilla load and unload here, when go to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, from whatever I have
heard or read of it, is beyond Diſpute the longeſt
in Extent; and, if we conſider the infinite and
great Wealth of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> perhaps the very
richeſt in the World.</p>
            <p>The Emperor of China, generally eſteemed the
greateſt Monarch for compaſs of Dominions, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
not above as much Land as all <hi>Europe</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
makes; but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has more
than that in <hi>America</hi> alone, beſides all his great
Dominions in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſome, though not very
large, in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> yet they are ſuch as are
of a conſiderable Value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0722300500:120"/>
It is well known that this Monarch has Lands
in all the four Parts of the World, and therefore
the Spaniards ſay the Sun never Sets upon his
Dominions. They are too large to be deſcrib'd by
me who here only give the Reader a view of them
in the Names of the ſeveral Countries with the
Arch-biſhopricks, Biſhopricks, and Univerſities,
in them together with the Number of Towns as
near as Authors have been able to compute, and
ſome Hints of Revenues which are as follows.</p>
            <p>In Spain twelve Kingdoms, or large Provinces,
which are Caſtile, Leon, Aragon, Navarre, Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>talonia,
Galicia, Valencia, Murcia, Biſcay, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,
Andaluzia, and Eſtremadura, wherein there
are ſixteen Thouſand ſeven Hundred Towns, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Arch-biſhopricks, and forty-ſeven Biſhopricks,
and fourteen Univerſities, the Revenues of the
Crown out of only theſe Provinces here mentioned,
amount to above thirty-ſix Millions of Ducats
yearly. The Income of the abovemention'd Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks
is near nineteen Million of ducats.</p>
            <p>The prebendaries, pariſhes, and other eccleſiaſtical
benifices, are worth as much more.</p>
            <p>There are nine thouſand monaſteries, and in them
near eighty thouſand religious perſons.</p>
            <p>The eſtates of the dukes that are grandees of <hi>Spain</hi>
are worth near two millions of ducats per annnm, and
ſome ſay a good deal more.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Marquiſſes that are grandees, about
one million and a half of ducats.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Earls grandees, upwards of four
hundred thouſand ducats.</p>
            <p>All theſe revenues are within the kingdom, without
including the vaſt income hoth King and Nobles yearly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0722300500:121"/>
have from the Weſt Indies, and other parts of the
world.</p>
            <p>I have heard the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> clergy declare, that their
moſt catholick, and auguſt monarch is the richeſt
and moſt powerful prince in the univerſe; but we all
know this is falſe; however, it was not my buſineſs
to contradict the prieſts, for I always concurr'd with
what they ſaid, becauſe I was greatly carreſs'd, and
led a lazy life, and lived very well amongſt them dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſtay.</p>
            <p>In Africa, on the Coaſt of Mazelquivir, the
King of Spain has Oran, Penon, Melillae and
Ceuta. The Canary Iſlands being ſeven in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
called Lancarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria,
Tenrife, Gomera, Falma, and Hierro.</p>
            <p>In Aſia he has the Philipine Iſlands, which with
others between them and New Spain, are poſſeſſed
by the Spaniards are above two Hundred, but the
chiefeſt of them all is Lucon, which though not
broad is above two Hundred Leagues in length,
on it is built a good City called Manila, upon a
noble River, at the Mouth of which is a ſtrong
Fortreſs, and on the other Side the River an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Town. All theſe Iſlands produce Gold,
Cinnamon and other rich Commodities.</p>
            <p>In America, he is Maſter of ſo many Iſlands on
the North Sea, that the Number was never yet
known. Thoſe call'd Kecayes, are many and large,
thoſe of St. John de Puerto Rico, about eighty
Leagues in Length, and twenty in Breadth, Cuba
three Hundred Leagues in Length, and twenty
in Breadth, Hiſpaniola above five Hundred
Leagues in Compaſs.</p>
            <p>The Continent of America, is divided into two
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0722300500:122"/>
Peninſulas, link'd together by a ſmall Neck of
Land, but eighteen Leagues over.</p>
            <p>The Northern Peninſula is called New Spain,
and the Southern Peru.</p>
            <p>The Southern Peninſula, which is all encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with the Sea, except where the Iſthmus joins
it it to the Continent, and here are many very rich
Provinces.</p>
            <p>In theſe Weſtern Countries there are ſix Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks
and thirty-one Biſhopricks; but as I
intend to have done with this Subject, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to my own Hiſtory, until I land myſelf once
more in my native Country.</p>
            <p>My good Friend, Mr. Mannock, having ſent
for me, told me, he had agreed for my Paſſage
Home, and that I muſt go on board in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the Ship would ſail the next Morning for
England: Whereupon I humbly thank'd him for
all Favours, and took my laſt Farewell of him,
highly overjoy'd at the Thoughts of my returning
one more to my native Country. But as I paſſed
through the City Gates with a full Intent to go on
Board, I unhappily met a Courtezan, a quandom
Acquaintace, with whom I ſtay'd all Night, but the
next Morning when I came down to the Mould, I
found to my equal Sorrow and Surprize, the Ship
was ſail'd; whereupon I was ſo enrag'd at this fatal
Diſappointment occaſioned entirely by my own
Folly, that I almoſt reſolved to put a Period to
my wretched Life, and now being no longer able
to ſtay at Cadiz, for fear of being ſeen by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Friend, I took Boat and went over to Fort
St. Mary, and from thence to St. Lucar, where I
had heard, that one Mr. Brown, a wealty Merchant
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0722300500:123"/>
reſided whoſe Siſter had been married to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
Sir <hi>Roger Langley.</hi> Here I had the Honour
to dine with this Gentleman, who made me a
a Preſent of two Doubloons, and adviſed me to
return Home. Whereupon, lodging at the Houſe
of one Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who kept an Ordinary for the
Maſters of Veſſels, I fortunately became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Captain <hi>Whitaker,</hi> bound for <hi>Cowes</hi>
and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> with this Gentleman I came Home,
landed at <hi>Limington,</hi> and from thence made the
beſt of my Way to <hi>London,</hi> where finding that
my Creditors had received 10 s. in the Pound in
my long Abſence, I was in Hopes of receiving
the ſum ſtipulated by Parliament for Bankrupts,
and thereby reinſtating myſelf in ſome ſettled Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
with my Wife. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> her Father being
dead in my Abſence, and all the Differences now
now ſeemingly thereby to be appeaſed, whereupon
I waited on my Mother-in-law, and to her made
Propoſals of ſending for my Wife to Town, which
ſhe agreed to, but through her avaritious Temper,
refuſed to aſſiſt me with Money to enable me to
advance myſelf once more in Trade, and recover my
Right from the Statute, and to obtain my Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
from the Creditors. Whereupon finding my
good Deſigns rend'red impracticable, I gave a
Looſe to falſe Pleaſure, leading a looſe and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Liſe, until I had almoſt exhauſted all my
ſlender Gains, as likewiſe a ſmall Legacy that was
leſt me by my Couſin <hi>Brent.</hi> Wherefore I now
reſolv'd once more to range abroad in Search of
new Adventures, and accidentally coming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with one Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> a young Spark of as
deſperate a Fortune as my own, with him I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0722300500:124"/>
to make a Tour to <hi>Paris</hi>; in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we travelled by Land to <hi>Dover,</hi> but on our
Arrival there, we were unhappily diſappointed in
our intended Progreſs, by an Embargo laid on the
Shipping in that Port.</p>
            <p>Where on our Return Home, Money being
low, we ſtopp'd <hi>John Springate</hi> of <hi>Feverſham,</hi>
within Sight of the Turnpike at <hi>Harble Down,</hi> but
upon rifling his Pockets, and finding no more
than three Farthings therein, not thinking ſo
inconſiderable a ſum worthy our Acceptance,
we return'd him the ſame, and civilly diſmiſſed
him.</p>

               <head>An Account of our being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and Commitment to
Maidſtone Gaol for this Robbery.</head>
               <p>THE ſame Day we committed this Robbery,
both of us were taken by a Hue and Cry,
raiſed by the Country, and after being reviled
by thoſe who were ſet as a Guard over us, we were
carried before a neighbouring Juſtice of the Peace,
where poor <hi>Springate</hi> appeared more terrified than
we were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0722300500:125"/>
As to my Part, I did not care what became
of me, for my Life had already been miſerable
enough; but my unfortunate <hi>Fellowman,</hi> (which
is generally uſed by thoſe who engage in bad
Courſes) or I may ſay, more properly, <hi>Brother
Thief</hi>) knew not the Conſequence of this Affair,
nor did he ſeem more affected than a poor Country
Fellow that had robb'd a Hen-Rooſt: I bid him be
quiet and eaſy, and keep up his Countenance, for
I was conſcious we had committed the Robbery,
and, if the Man ſwore to our Perſons, we muſt
ſtand committed to the County Gaol.</p>
               <p>After we had tarried near an Hour in the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where the Juſtice hears Affairs of this kind,
in came his worſhip with his bouncing Belly, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Conſtable, Headborough, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingmen,
who all of them ſeem'd to be pleaſed
with the Reward of 80 <hi>l.</hi> that they ſhould have
for hanging us, and quarrelled in the Hall, even
before the Magiſtrate was ſeated, who was entitled
to the greateſt Share.</p>
               <p>After Silence was demanded in the Hall, <hi>Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi>
the Conſtable, who had Charge of us, was
commanded to bring us forward to the Place of
Audience. Both of us had our Hands tied behind
us, at that Time; but his Worſhip was ſo humane
as to order us to be untied, which was done in an
Inſtant.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we tarried for a Hearing, the Juſtice had
Notice brought him by a Livery Servant, that Sir

to take a Dinner with him.—His Worſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
but returned again preſently, on purpoſe
to diſpatch us one way or other.—I had forgot to
mention, that poor <hi>Hill,</hi> whilſt we were together
in the Hall, whiſper'd me, and ſaid, <hi>why</hi> Gill,
<hi>this is only a Bridewell Job,</hi> tell me?—I ſhook my
Head, and told him, I was afraid it was much
worſe;—at which he appear'd to be quite diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and very ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>Our Examination before the Juſtice was but
very ſhort; <hi>Springate</hi> was called, and aſk'd if he
knew either of us, and was cautioned to be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to what he ſwore.</p>
               <p>He told the Juſtice that we had robb'd him, but
he believed it was only <hi>in Fun,</hi> (that it is in a
merry Way) for that he had got his Three Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
returned him again.</p>
               <p>However, ſome of the Country Fellows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
him to ſwear that he was put in ſear of his
Life; and told him, that if he did not, we ſhould
ruin him for ever;—ſo the poor Fellow very
juſtly ſwore it; we did order him to deliver; and
ſwore we wou'd either have his Money or his Life.
From my Heart, I don't believe the Man would
have troubled himſelf about us, had he not been
ſpirited on by his clowniſh Acquaintance, (I mean
our Purſuers and Apprehenders) who wanted us
hanged for the ſake of the Reward, which was
ſorry Pounds ſor each of us.</p>
               <p>On the Man's poſitive affidavit, the Juſtice ſoon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0722300500:127"/>
ordered his Footman to write our <hi>Mittimus</hi> to the
County Goal, where we were convey'd by a ſtrong Poſſee,
being mounted on Horſeback, with our Legs chained
under the Horſe's Belly, and guarded by thirty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Loobies, the Conſtable who had the Commitment,
riding firſt with his long Staff, pitched on his Boot,
exactly repreſenting an Officer guarding a poer Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
to the Place of Execution.</p>
               <p>At this Time the Country being peſtered with Smug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers,
and as we paſſed on to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> every Body
imagined we were ſome of that Gang that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be taken in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which caus'd Numbers
of People, both on Horſeback and on Foot to follow
us into <hi>Maidſtone</hi> Town. I never in my Life ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſo great a Puniſhment as the Fatigue of this
Journey from the Juſtice's to Priſon; it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
hot Weather, and in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
I could not perſuade my Guard to ſtop for a little
Refreſhment, the Conſtable pretending he apprehended a
Reſcue was intended by the Smugglers.</p>
               <p>When we approached near the Entrance of <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi>
Town, there appeared to me to be as many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as were generally at <hi>Newgate</hi> to ſee the poor Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
go forth to Execution.</p>
               <p>As I went into the Goal I thought to myſelf, <hi>Poor</hi>
Gill, <hi>here you have caſt you laſt Stone</hi>! My Friend
<hi>Hill, napp'd his Bibb</hi> (a cant Term for Weeping)
and ſaid he was ruin'd. I told him, <hi>I hop'd not,</hi>
                  <hi>but I was afraid we were undone (Body and Breeches)
'till next Month</hi>; meaning the time we were to be

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0722300500:128"/>
No ſooner were we un-hors'd, but the <hi>cunning</hi>
Conſtable deliver'd his Commitment o the Turnkey,
who was a <hi>funny Dog</hi>; and on looking at it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
it to the Conſtable, telling him he had no Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

Conſtable ſtar'd; and the Turnkey ſnatching the

we, with ſorrowful Hearts, were oblig'd to comply
with.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding I was under theſe unhappy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
nothing diverted more than the Paſtime

ſuch Fellows as he were the only Perſons that

               <p>Poor <hi>Hill</hi> (who now look'd as cunning as a dead

<hi>flung</hi> 'em, for he's a funny Dog, and a ſpecial

was called out to take Charge of another Priſoner,
and I was glad he was gone, fearing he wanted my
little Cole, having only that to ſupport me.</p>
               <p>Newgate now came freſh into my Memory, but
recommend me to that Priſon (terrible as the Name
is) for Humanity; for being a Priſoner there for
Debt a conſiderable Time, I could perceive how
the Felons were uſed by the under Keepers, and
even the Maſter of the Gaol himſelf, who at that
Time was Rowland Ingram, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who would
come into the Common Felons Ward, and hear
Complaints againſt the Jiggers or Runners, if
they had beat or injured any one.</p>
               <p>Our Turnkey of <hi>Maidſtone</hi> was a civil Fellow
enough, eſpecially to thoſe who had the Caſh, and
of the three Shillings I had, he was ſo civil as to
accept only of half a Crown; and when he got
near my <hi>All,</hi> he deſired one of the Followers to
put on our Darbies.—This Scene, which I never
had yet been accuſtom'd to, gave me the greateſt
Uneaſineſs; but to do Juſtice to my worthy Friend,

round the Leg.</p>

our Journey the Day before.</p>
               <p>In the Morning at the Time of unlocking our
ward, I aſk'd the Turnkey, if I could be admitted
to write a Line or two to a Friend in London, for
a little Subſiſtance. He told me I was welcome,
provided I was furniſh'd with Pen, Ink, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but that not being in my Power to obtain for
want of Caſh, to ſupply the Urgency, I was oblig'd
to ſell my Shirt, which ſetch'd me one and twenty
Pence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>That Day I wrote to my good Friend Mr.
<hi>G<gap reason="blank" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> informing him of my terrible Condition;
but whether he ever received the Letter I know
not, no Anſwer being ever returned, which was
a very ſhocking Diſappointment to me. I really
believe the Huſſy that I entruſted to carry it to the
Poſt Houſe, ſunk the Two-pence I gave her;
the week after the Mother of a Fellow Priſoner,
who daily viſited her Son, was ſo kind to carry a
Letter for me, which I had wrote to a woman I
formerly kept Company with near St. Martin's in
the Fields.</p>
               <p>This Letter was received, but not by the Party
it was directed to, ſhe having been married ſome
Time before; but her Siſter, lodging in the ſame
Houſe, luckily took it from the Poſtman, and
opening it, read the Contents, which ſhe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
communicated to her Siſter; which laſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0722300500:134"/>
Lady was ſo kind as to remit me a 27 <hi>s.</hi> Piece by
the Maidſtone Carrier, who fafely deliver'd it,
incloſed in a Letter, into my own Hands.</p>
               <p>I would have paid the Carrier, but he refuſed to
accept of a Farthing, ſaying that he ſcorned to
take any thing from a poor Priſoner; for this
generous action I return'd him my hearty Thanks,
which he freely accepted of for his Trouble, and
call'd for two Mugs of Ale to treat my unfortunate
Companion and myſelf.</p>
               <p>Soon as the honeſt Man was gone I peruſed
the Contents of the Letter, which contain'd ſome
Reflections on my former Folly, and the bad
Uſage ſhe had received from me, tho' the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Epiſtle was no ways intended to affront
me under my unhappy Calamity. I confeſs I wept
heartily; and the next Day I wrote her an Anſwer,
which was ſent to a place by her own direction;
by her own Deſire; but I never received any
Return, or ever heard from her again, which I was
heartily ſorry for, conſidering my terrible Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
               <p>I lived, whilſt under my unhappy confinement,
pretty tolerable, ſrequently doing little ſervices for
my ſellow priſoners, in writing petitions and
letters to their relations, by which I gained their
good-will, and the eſteem of all thoſe belonging
to the priſon:</p>
