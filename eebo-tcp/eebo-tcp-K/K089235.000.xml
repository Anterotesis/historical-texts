            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOST ages have produced ſome ſhining models of undaunted virtue and unabating patriotiſm.—It is the part of the Biographer to ſelect characters from the maſs of mankind, and to hold thoſe only up to view who have been moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the vaſt theatre of human
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0095001500:4"/>
life. Were men to be promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſcribed, little advantage would be derived from reviewing the annals of paſt or preſent times, and the eye, after a glance, would turn away with wearineſs, as from an unbounded plain, or a mirror, where all objects were preſented indiſcriminately.—But if others have laboured under the diſadvantage of deſcribing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters equally mixed with right and wrong, the Author here has little reaſon to complain of ſuch blended materials.—He gives one, bold, enterprizing, and the ſame, ever poſſeſſing uniform principles,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0095001500:5"/>
without deviation and without ambiguity.</p>
            <p>A man, ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to be completely great, muſt be born in ſome famous city.—<hi>London</hi> boaſts the birth of Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi>— His mother, it is reported, was delivered without pain or labour; and a ſpectre appeared to the nurſe, which foretold that the child ſhe then ſuckled, ſhould prove the ornament and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire: cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which to many would have appeared trifling and enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic, had not his future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0095001500:6"/>
evinced the truth of the prediction.</p>
            <p>Of his Family nothing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported but in extreams; for whilſt ſome would have him to be the ſon of a diſtiller, and bred up to the caſk, others trace him up to a moſt illuſtrious origin: but when ſome of his friends judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould change his name before he engaged in ſtate affairs, he prettily enough repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he would make the name of <hi>Wilkes</hi> more glorious than that of a <hi>Catiline</hi> or a <hi>Cade</hi>; and when having ſerved the high
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0095001500:7"/>
and important office of Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> and the citizens were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of making an oblation of ſilver plate to him, ſo far from renouncing his origin, that he deſired his figure with a dagger in his hand to deſtroy a monarch, ſhould be engraved on the ſide of a large Drinking Cup.</p>
            <p>Now he being, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays a ſcholar ought to be, diſpoſed to all manner of learning, and neglectful of no arts, cultivated, beſides his other ſtudies, an early taſte for poetry, and with ſuch

paper, written by the late Reverend Mr. <hi>Churchill,</hi> and containing many ſpirited attacks againſt government, which not being well received, a proceſs was preferred againſt the author. Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> being never likely to have a more fair or honourable introduction to glory, generouſly declared the paper to be his own, —defied all government, and has been admired and rewarded for it. In ſhort, in all his writings, whether he arraigned the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of others, or eſtabliſhed any doctrines of his own, there were always found both the harmony
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0095001500:12"/>
of order, and the decency of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. —His reaſons were ſolid and convincing, his inductions pleaſing and agreeable; he was maſter of every ſubject of which he treated, and treated none but what were amply for the benefit of mankind.</p>
            <p>But <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> at that time had not the pleaſure of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s acquaintance.</note> fearing ſome Creditors, and having ſuffered in a Duel, he travelled into <hi>France</hi> with many other great men, for the recovery of his health and fortune. There
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0095001500:13"/>
he lived in eaſe and affluence, ſupplied with money from the diſintereſted in <hi>England,</hi> as well as with large ſums ariſing from the ſale of Jewels, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which his ſkill and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs procured him abroad.—His body daily gaining ſtrength, he was ſoon moſt earneſtly ſollicited to return to <hi>England,</hi> where he again furbiſhed up his Rhetoric, and re-excited all his political fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. For ſome time he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have retired to his eſtate at <hi>Ayleſbury,</hi> but thinking it wrong to give the trouble of long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to thoſe who made ſuit to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0095001500:14"/>
him, he gave up his eſtate there to be divided amongſt his friends, and then reſided altogether in town, for the convenience of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buſineſs; and indeed there were not fewer attending at his door, than formerly on <hi>Croeſus</hi> for his wealth, or <hi>Pompey</hi> for his power.</p>
            <p>And now being full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and ſolely bent on the welfare of the public, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted an oracle how he ſhould ſooneſt arrive at the Summit of all Political Glory.—The <hi>Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> replied, — that he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

his conſtituents at <hi>Ayleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and make the opinion of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> the rule and guide of his life.—The decrees of fate are irreſiſtible.—Indeed he would have ſubmitted to have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the city of <hi>London</hi>; but his friends moſt prudently prevented him, and compelled him to blaze out at once as the Member for <hi>Middleſex,</hi> amidſt the united ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of a grateful king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note n="*" place="bottom">Twelve men, from a ſpirit of patriotiſm, drew Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> through the city; and, as appeared from one of his agents books, agreed only for the ſmall ſum of twelve pound twelve, as a gratuity for their ſervices.</note>.—From this happy event every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> might juſtly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0095001500:16"/>
have expected to have dated the aera of his felicity. — A Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor repreſenting (what is called) the firſt County, burning with a religious zeal to execute his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant charge, and fully qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to regulate with an eye of intuition every the minuteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the juſt equilibre of church and ſtate: but ſuch, alas! is the fate of all human things, that the people were no ſooner put in poſſeſſion of their greateſt bleſſing, than they were deprived
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0095001500:17"/>
of it. — The Parliament ſpoke ſparingly of his merits, and as he had been impriſoned for treaſon and blaſphemy, were willing to vindicate one bad action by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting another. — They aſſerted, that as
<q>no felon was eligible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any important office, a man ſo like a felon, that he could not be diſtinguiſhed, ought certainly to be expelled:</q>
but let me remind theſe gentlemen, that the contrary was juſtified by many of the moſt experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawyers at that time, and has ſince been well explained by the

ſay, "that the County in which he lived, as well as five or ſix more adjoining, had not only not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned, but he believed felt no grievances, and he was ſorry the Noble Lord would not allow him one honeſt Freeholder in his neighbourhood."—This appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many but as ill-timed raillery, and ſo far from invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the truth of the Great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator's aſſertion, that it only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a melancholy proof of Lord <hi>Sandwich</hi>'s apoſtacy. — I will not dwell on the many dreadful conſequences attending Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi>'s expulſion, — the

reader, the generous reader, feels the weight of them too forcibly, and I ſee him with tears in his eyes lamenting that luckleſs hour, when virtue was ſtrip'd of its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, honeſty of its robe, and a fatal, an everlaſting blow was given to the very vitals of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Miniſterial Hirelings now daily echoed reproaches againſt him; — they inſinuated that he had defrauded the Foundling Hoſpital, and burnt Mr. <hi>Sylva</hi>'s Notes.—The latter was the only circumſtance that ſeemed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger

who is known to be a ſtrenuous aſſertor of the laws of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?—As to the Foundling Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> conſidered it as a baſe Inſtitution from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,— it encouraged Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardy;—however, he ſubmitted the whole tranſaction to the <note n="*" place="bottom">Taylor White.</note> Treaſurer, whoſe private virtues might be ſaid to go hand in hand with his own, and from whoſe repreſentation of the caſe, the city ſeemed ſo well ſatisfied of their equal integrity, that they gave an entire credit to the one, and by chooſing the other Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0095001500:25"/>
not only made him the Guardian of public truſt, but of courſe Governor to almoſt all other Hoſpitals.</p>
            <p>The Honour of being Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man likewiſe entitled him to the high and important office of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, which afforded him many favourable opportunities of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing his Humanity; — he felt moſt tenderly for thoſe who partook of one common nature with himſelf, and in his Zeal for Liberty, not only ordered their chains to be ſtruck off during their trials, but inſiſted on their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0095001500:26"/>
removal from <hi>Newgate,</hi> to be more immediately under his own inſpection, that he might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally inſtruct them in their ſeveral duties, and let them out at proper times to practiſe their different occupations, in order to diſcharge the jailors fees.— Nor was this glorious plan of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty confined to one ſet of men only — all ranks, all orders, in ſome degree felt the weight of his influence.— The meſſengers and officers who before had uſed to take up any man whom the Parliament deemed highly crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, now tremble leaſt the Lord

               <hi>Wilſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Horne</hi> that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is Impoſture. — Nor is this the ſyſtem of a day only, but the education of our youth is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to inculcate theſe generous principles:—the poor Apprentice, who before had uſed to read his Bible in the evening, or play at Cribbage with his Miſtreſs, now leaves the houſe, and diſcourſes like a <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi>

            <p>Not even the Military could repreſs Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi>'s ardour: — at his inſtigation thoſe ſplendid Hirelings were reſtrained from carrying arms through the city, — their very drum was ſilenced, and they were taught, that though they were kept at a vaſt expence to parade in <hi>Hyde-Park,</hi> and now and then to be reviewed, yet they were to be conſidered as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, not as the ſecurity of the State, and it was unconſtitutional
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0095001500:30"/>
for them to interfere, though the Life of their Sovereign was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked in his Palace.</p>
            <p>Nor were thoſe learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Long Robe more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their dignities. — Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> could explain to a <hi>Middleſex</hi> Jury, that the King had no right to the Land-tax, — that his power and that of the Parliament was not equal to that of a Petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable's; and it was illegal for him in any inſtance to extend his mercy when the people clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for blood: — nay, when the late Judge <hi>Yates</hi> preſumed only,

in paſſing ſentence on Mr. <hi>Wilkes,</hi> to glance at his poem, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reverence due to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity — the people (ſuch was the Patriot's popularity) laughed him openly to ſcorn, though Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> himſelf with great polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and candour ſaid, that

            <p>He might even be ſaid to be out of the power of Medicine; for on the Parliament deſiring a Phyſician to inſpect him, whilſt in danger from a duel, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed <hi>Hebberden</hi> for being illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0095001500:32"/>
and ordered no one to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere, unleſs they would ſend nurſe <hi>Grenv—e</hi> herſelf to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a gliſter.</p>
            <p>By extending the liberty of the Preſs, all public and private characters are now fully delineat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: —from this great prerogative, the birth-right of all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> we are enabled to ſpeak truth with impunity — to ſay, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Junius</hi> and others.</note> a "<hi>Mansfield</hi> has no integrity, a <hi>Grafton</hi> no abilities, and that the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> rejoiced at the

death of his only ſon, — that the perſon of our Sovereign is ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, — his manners depraved, his private character immoral, and his public one unjuſt, — that he is the worſt orator that ever ſpoke to a parliament, — a parent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the welfare of his family, — has no care for the State, but, like <hi>Nero,</hi> "fiddles whilſt <hi>Rome</hi> is burning."</p>
            <p>The Fine Arts live not but in a ſtate of Liberty, but now they flouriſh'd in all their branches;— Muſic was united with Poetry, and Mr. <hi>Wilkes,</hi> their <hi>Apollo,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0095001500:34"/>
ſtruck the maſter lyre: — his poetry was a mixed ſpecies of the Lyric and Didactic, but managed with ſuch amazing ſkill, that it was echoed not only from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> but <hi>balladed</hi> about through every Fair and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town in the kingdom:— but, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Homines plus oculis quam auribus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, longum iter per praecepta, per exempla breve et efficax. TACITUS.</note> "Men ſooner believe their eyes than their ears;" ſo he gave great encouragement likewiſe to all Artiſts to line their ſhops with Prints, Emblems, Sketches, and Aenigmatic Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

— ſuch as ſhould not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhow the Delicacy of their Art, but convey either a Fable, Moral, or Hiſtory; and he had the pleaſing ſatisfaction to find that a <hi>Fox hanging,</hi> a <hi>Load of Straw,</hi> or a <hi>ſuſpended Boot,</hi> had more effect, not only on the multitude, but even on the City of <hi>London,</hi> than all the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated labours of a Univerſity Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</p>
            <p>It was Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi>'s peculiar happineſs to be always connected with characters ſimilar to his own, as they ſay the Magnet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0095001500:36"/>
only thoſe fragments that are of kindred qualities: but now and then theſe fragments were at enmity amongſt themſelves:— when altercations aroſe about the diſpoſal of Places, or the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Public Money, they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued ſo freely on their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative merits, that though I have no doubt but they all ſpoke Truth of one another, yet I think it was ſometimes rather impolitic ſo fully to unveil to the common eye the deeper myſteries of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic Duty.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0095001500:37"/>Every period of Hiſtory affords ſome ſtriking inſtances of the triumphs of Virtue over Power; — a <hi>Cromwell</hi> at one time, and a <hi>Tyler</hi> at another, have been equally the Idols of the Many:— the very Children of one <note n="*" place="bottom">Henry II.</note> Prince not only revolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but deſtroy'd their Father: —from Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> then, who is a glorious Compound of all theſe illuſtrious Characters, what may not be expected? for, unhappily for this nation, it is governed by a King, who holds Principles DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE; he has
