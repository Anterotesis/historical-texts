            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING promis'd a Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of this Hiſtory when I
publiſh'd the Firſt, it is now
become a Debt of ſo many Years
ſtanding, that I don't know whether the
bare diſcharging it will be thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
without ſaying ſomething in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for my having deferr'd it ſo long.
And yet upon ſecond Thoughts, I believe
I might eaſily have been forgiven, if I had
never diſcharg'd it: For the World is not
ſo rigid in demanding Debts of this kind,
as we Authors imagine. But to deal plainly,
I have been many Years employ'd in Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of another kind; tho' I muſt confeſs
it has been with very little Advantage to
the Publick, or Myſelf; and much leſs do
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:4"/>
I propoſe any great Benefit to ariſe to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from this Undertaking. However it
has ſerv'd to ſhift the Scene a little, and to
gratify my own Inclinations, in renewing
my Acquaintance with thoſe Studies which
I have formerly purſu'd.</p>
            <p>I have pleas'd myſelf with the Thoughts
of doing ſome ſort of Juſtice to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of a Race of Worthies, who may
be call'd the firſt Aſſertors of publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
And if I have not ſucceeded ſo
well in it as I could wiſh, I hope it will
be imputed rather to the Nature of the
Subject, than to any want of my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
In the former Part of this Hiſtory,
I did not find it an eaſy Task to take off
that Veil of <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Fiction,</hi> which has
been thrown over the firſt Ages of <hi>Greece,</hi>
and to introduce, in the room of it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like the <hi>Colouring</hi> of Hiſtory. And
even in the later Times, which are call'd
<hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> I have met with too much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy
and Confuſion, in the treating of
ſo many ſeparate States, in unravelling
their different Intereſts, in deſcribing their
different Manners and Cuſtoms, and Forms
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:5"/>
of Government, and in connecting the
Whole with the Body of the Story.</p>
            <p>In the Progreſs of this Work, I have
found more Difficulties of this kind, than
I apprehended at my firſt Entrance upon
it; and it is that which, I believe, has
chiefly diſcourag'd others from undertaking
it. For I cannot otherwiſe conceive how
it ſhould happen, that the Hiſtory of a
Country, which has been the Scene of ſo
much Action within itſelf, and which has
given Birth to ſo many great Events in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts of the World, ſhould be ſo
much neglected. I do not mean, that it
has been wholly buried in the Ruſt and
Ruins of Antiquity; but it certainly has
not receiv'd a due Proportion of thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
which have been made of late
Years both in Ancient and Modern Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as well as in other Arts and Sciences.
For tho' there have been many Parts of
the Affairs of the <hi>Grecians</hi> extracted from
their Hiſtorians, and Biographers, Poets,
Orators and Philoſophers, with great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Gloſſes and Comments upon 'em;
yet they are in ſuch detach'd Pieces, and
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:6"/>
ſo unmethodiz'd, that they can only ſerve
as the Ground-work for a more regular
Compoſition; and as ſuch I have made
uſe of them. There are ſome Collections
of this kind, which are more in the Form
of Hiſtory: But the Facts contain'd in
them are related in ſo dry and lifeleſs a
manner, that there is nothing of the true
Spirit of <hi>Greece</hi> in them. And a further
Objection to them is, that they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
with the Affairs of other Nations,
which have no relation to them. This is
the Method obſerv'd by the Writers of
<hi>Univerſal Hiſtory,</hi> whoſe chief Merit is
the preſerving the Order of Time; but for
the ſake of that, they invert the Order of
Place, and hurry you on from one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to another, without any natural Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Connection. Such a confuſed Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Matter may do well enough, when
it is compriſed in thoſe ſhort <hi>Compendiums</hi>
of <hi>Chronology,</hi> which are deſign'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
on the Memory the Dates of the
moſt remarkable Events, as they have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in the World. But the relating
things at length in an Hiſtorical Way, and
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:7"/>
blending together Sacred Story and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
Ancient and Modern, Foreign and
Domeſtick, as it diſtracts the Mind of the
Reader too much, ſo it is a Work of too
great Labour and Extent for the Writer,
to be throughly executed.</p>
            <p>He who has ſucceeded beſt in this way,
is <hi>Monſieur Rollin,</hi> who has cull'd out the
Flowers of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Story, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd
them in the Accounts, which he
has given of the other ancient Kingdoms
and Common-wealths. But beſides the
relating things by Piece-meal in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
manner before-mention'd, he has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſeveral Particulars which are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and in others which are not ſo, he is
too circumſtantial. And his Reflections,
tho' they are generally juſt, are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and too tedious, too trite and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
and too juvenile. However they
may be ſuited to the Deſign of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in the Inſtitution of Youth, and may
ſerve as Lectures to inſtil into their Minds
Principles of Virtue and Morality, they
are not ſo agreeable as they ſhould be to
the Laws of Hiſtory, which will allow of
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:8"/>
very few Reflections, but ſuch as naturally
ariſe to the Reader from a ſimple Relation
of Facts, or ſuch at leaſt, as are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
in the Body of the Story, ſo as not
to break the Thread of it. I would not
be thought to detract from the Merit of a
Work, which has met with a pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Approbation, and is now in every Body's
Hands. The Author has certainly taken
great Care and Pains in it: He is copious
in his Matter, faithful in his Authorities,
and clear and eaſy in his Narration; and
there is a Spirit of Liberty throughout the
Whole, which is well ſuited to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and which few of his Countrymen,
except <hi>Monſieur Tourreil,</hi> have attain'd to.
Wherefore, tho' I had compos'd the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Sheets before his Hiſtory appear'd
in the World, I will freely own, that it
has been of Service to me in the Reviſal of
them.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe acknowledge the Lights
I have receiv'd in ſeveral Paſſages of this
Hiſtory, from the <hi>Grecian Antiquities</hi> of
<hi>The moſt Reverend the Lord Archbiſhop of
Canterbury,</hi> who is no leſs eminent for his
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:9"/>
extenſive Knowledge in all Parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than for his other great Qualities.
And however this Work may have ſerv'd
as an Amuſement to <hi>His Grace</hi> in the early
Courſe of his Studies, it cannot now be
thought unworthy of his more advanc'd
Age, nor unbecoming either his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
or his high Station.</p>
            <p>Juſt before I ſent theſe Sheets to the
Preſs, I met with <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,
lately publiſh'd at <hi>Paris</hi> by the
<hi>Abbé de la Tour,</hi> being intended to ſupply
the Loſs of that Life of him, which was
wrote by <hi>Plutarch.</hi> I likewiſe receiv'd <hi>A
Diſcourſe</hi> in Manuſcript upon the ſame
Subject, which had been pronounc'd in the
<hi>Academy of the Belles Lettres and Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
by the <hi>Abb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eA Gedoyn,</hi> and which was
communicated to me in a very obliging
manner from <hi>Monſieur de Fontenelle.</hi> I was
deſirous to ſee if any thing material had
eſcap'd me in my Account of the greateſt
Man of <hi>Greece:</hi> And the Peruſal of theſe
two Pieces has ſerv'd to clear up to me
ſome doubtful Paſſages concerning him,
and to confirm me in others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0761100600:10"/>
As to this ſecond Part of the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Story, it contains the Tranſactions of ſixty
eight Years, which is not a twentieth Part
of the Time compris'd in the firſt Volume:
But what it wants in the Number of Years,
is made up in the Variety of Events, and
the Fullneſs of the Materials. This Compaſs
of Time, together with the twenty-ſeven
preceding Years of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, was
the moſt active and buſtling Age of the
<hi>Grecians,</hi> who, when they were freed from
the Danger of a Foreign Enemy, fell into
ſuch Diſſenſions, as turn'd the Edge of the
Sword againſt themſelves, and ended in
the Deſtruction of that Liberty, which
they had ſo gloriouſly defended. There
were ſtill among them ſome true Patriots,
who aim'd at nothing further than the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Safety of <hi>Greece,</hi> and an equal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
among the ſeveral Common-wealths:
But it was the fixing and preſerving this
Balance, which created ſo much Difficulty
and Diſturbance. Among ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Governments and popular Aſſemblies,
it was hardly poſſible to avoid Confuſion
and Diſcord: And the <hi>Demagogues,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:11"/>
other artful and deſigning Men, from
hence took occaſion to perplex and inflame
Matters ſtill more, in order to carry on
their own ſelfiſh Views at the Expence of
the Publick. There was one Part of the
Conſtitution of <hi>Greece</hi> well deſign'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
theſe Inconveniences, and that was
the <hi>Council of the Amphictyons,</hi> who were
in the nature of <hi>States General,</hi> and were
intended not only to provide for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good and Safety of the Whole, but
to decide the Differences, and adjuſt the
Pretenſions of each particular State; and
great Regard was paid to their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But tho' they were conven'd twice
a Year, it was moſtly for form-ſake; ſo
that, except upon ſome very extraordinary
Occaſions, they ſeldom did any thing that
anſwer'd the End of their Inſtitution.
The <hi>Grecians</hi> had other ſpecious Shews of
Liberty, and their publick Harangues were
full of it; but it was chiefly in Shew and
in Words, for the Spirit of it was in a
great meaſure loſt. The Band of Amity,
which had united them againſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians,</hi>
was diſſolv'd. The open, generous
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:12"/>
and diſintereſted Valour, which they ſhew'd
upon that Occaſion, began daily to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into Sloth and Luxury, Faction and
Corruption, Fraud and Violence. The
Greater States devour'd the Leſſer, and
then prey'd upon one another. In ſhort,
the great Bone of Contention now among
them, was the Sovereignty of <hi>Greece,</hi>
which moſt of them aſpir'd to in their
turns; and ſtill, as one Competitor fail'd in
it, there ſtarted up another. Such was the
convulſive State of <hi>Greece</hi> at the time of
the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War; and ſo it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as long as it was a Nation. There were
indeed ſome quiet Intervals; but they
were ſhort, and ſuch as ſerv'd rather
to recover breath, than to ſettle any
courſe of Tranquillity.</p>
            <p>In relating theſe Wars of the <hi>Grecians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, the Reader is not to expect
ſuch great and ſurpriſing Incidents, as thoſe
which happen'd in their Defence againſt
the <hi>Perſians.</hi> He will not meet with ſuch
numerous Armies, as thoſe which came
with all the Power of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
Inundation, upon them; nor with ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:13"/>
ſignal Victories, as thoſe which have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated
the Names of <hi>Marathon, Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,
Plataea</hi> and <hi>Mycale.</hi> The Efforts,
which were then made for the Publick
Liberty, had ſomething more than human
in them, and are not to be accounted for
according to the ordinary courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But however the <hi>Eclat</hi> of theſe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Actions may raiſe our Attention
and Admiration; yet an Account of the
inteſtine Quarrels which ſucceeded them,
will furniſh us with more of that uſeful
Knowledge and Inſtruction, which is to
be drawn from Hiſtory. There were few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Numbers then brought into the Field,
and leſs Blood ſhed: But the Merit of
theſe later Victories conſiſted more in the
Skill and Conduct of the Generals, and
the Diſcipline of the Troops, than in
the Number of the ſlain. There were
more Feints and Stratagems, Marches and
Countermarches, Incampments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments,
more ſurpriſing of Garriſons,
intercepting of Convoys, debauching of
Allies, and cluding of Treaties. In ſhort,
the <hi>Grecians</hi> were now become much more
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:14"/>
expert and refined in the Art of War, and
leſs prodigal of their Lives, than when
they had nothing but an hardy deſperate
Valour to oppoſe to the Multitudes of the
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> and when by that glorious
Stand made at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> one part of
them devoted themſelves to certain death
for the Preſervation of the reſt. Hence it
was, that theſe civil Diſcords were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to a greater Length, than could
otherwiſe have been imagin'd: For conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Heat and Rancour, with which
they were carried on, and that the Scene
of Action lay in ſo narrow a Compaſs as
<hi>Greece</hi> ſtrictly ſo call'd, it might naturally
have been expected, that things would
ſooner have been brought to ſome general
Iſſue, and that, by ſome deciſive Stroke,
one of the principal Republicks would
have made an intire Conqueſt of the
Whole. Beſides the Reaſons already given
for the long Continuance, and the fatal
Iſſue of theſe Wars, another material one
may be aſſign'd, which is, that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
were not content to decide their own
Quarrel, without intereſting Foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:15"/>
in it. Moſt of them, to their eternal
Reproach, as they found themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd,
made mean Applications to their
old Enemies the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had found
out the Secret of fomenting their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and ſupporting one State againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
in order to weaken the Whole.
<hi>Philip</hi> afterwards improv'd upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the <hi>Perſians</hi> had ſet him; and thus
in the end the <hi>Grecian</hi> Liberties were loſt.
The Means by which this Change was
effected, and the Struggles, which were
now and then made by particular Perſons
and States, for recovering the ancient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Greece,</hi> is chiefly the Subject of
this Volume.</p>
            <p>Here it may not be improper to obſerve,
that notwithſtanding theſe Commotions,
with which the whole Country was more
or leſs agitated, Arts and Sciences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
daily Improvement, and were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on to a great degree of Perfection; and
there was more Politeneſs and Civility,
more Policy and Intrigue, more good
Writing and Speaking, and a greater Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Men eminent in all Profeſſions,
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:16"/>
than in any other Period of time in
<hi>Greece,</hi> or in any other Country in that
Age of the World. And as a thorough
Knowledge of the Lives and Characters of
theſe famous Men, does very much conduce to
the Knowledge of the Hiſtory of the Times
they liv'd in, I have therefore been the
more exact in deſcribing them, ſo as to
diſtinguiſh their good and bad Qualities,
and to ſhew in what manner, and in what
degree, they have been beneficial, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Country. In the doing this,
I have found it difficult to reconcile the
different Accounts which have been given
of them by ſome of the Hiſtorians of
thoſe Times, who often claſh with one
another, and ſometimes even with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
All that I could do in this caſe,
was to compare them together, to ſupply
the Defects of one out of another, and
to extract out of the whole thoſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
which appear'd to me the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and probable, and moſt conſiſtent with
the common known Character of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I was deſcribing. I have obſerv'd the
ſame Method with regard to Facts, as well
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:17"/>
as Perſons, throughout the Courſe of this
Hiſtory; and where I have met with any
eſſential Difference, or manifeſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
I have taken notice of it as ſuch
in the Body of the Story.</p>
            <p>If we conſider how many Volumes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Affairs of the <hi>Grecians</hi> have
been loſt, we might expect more Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and greater Chaſms in their Story, than
there really are: But it happens very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately,
that ſome of their beſt Writers,
and of the beſt Authority, are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
particularly <hi>Thucydides, Xenophon</hi>
and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who had a great Share
in the Tranſactions they relate, and were
otherwiſe moſt remarkable for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity
and Veracity. So that the <hi>Groecia
mendax</hi> of <hi>Juvenal</hi> cannot be thought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to theſe Writers, or to the Times
in which they flouriſh'd, but muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
only of the <hi>Fabulous Age,</hi> which
undoubtedly is a fitter Subject for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
of Poetry, than for the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of an Hiſtorian. I have accordingly
conſider'd it in that light, and have gone
no further into it than I found neceſſary, in
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:18"/>
order to make a beginning, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the more ſolid and authentick Parts
of the Story. And herein I am ſufficiently
warranted by the Example of our own
Hiſtorians, who have not contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the wild Accounts of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Britons,</hi> but have had recourſe to
the <hi>Trojan Brute</hi> as our Founder: And the
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Writers begin their Relations from
a Son of <hi>Cecrops</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> or of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
who lived an hundred Years before
him. And tho' there is no great Streſs laid
upon theſe early Accounts, they are ſufficient
to ſhew, that we have grafted upon the
ſame Stock of <hi>Fable</hi> as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or
rather carried it further, and grafted one
Fable upon another: And the ſame Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
has prevail'd in ſeveral other Parts of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I cannot help obſerving, how much
it is to the honour of <hi>Greece,</hi> that ſo many
Nations have laid claim to her as their
common Mother; and that they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
ſo many Fictions and Forgeries to
be conſider'd as <hi>Grecian</hi> Colonies, when
they might more naturally, and with more
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:19"/>
Credibility, have drawn their Deſcent from
ſome imaginary Heroes of their own. But
it was the eſtabliſh'd Fame, and the real
Merit of <hi>Greece,</hi> that made them ſo fond
of being allied to her: It was the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Wit and Delicacy of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Laws
and Diſcipline of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the Valour
and Love of Liberty throughout the whole
Country, which put them upon forming
theſe Pretenſions, in hopes that, by calling
themſelves <hi>Grecians,</hi> they ſhould be thought
to inherit their Virtues, and to act upon
their Principles. And in ſome Reſpects
they have copied after them, particularly
in their Forms of Government, which
have ſerv'd as Models to ſeveral conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
States in this Part of the World, but
with ſuch Variations and Improvements,
as the Wiſdom of the later ages has found
neceſſary. For tho' the general Plan of
Government in <hi>Greece</hi> was founded upon
Principles of Liberty, there were great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Defects in it, which I have cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily
taken notice of, in relating the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and Diſorders that have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by them. Some of theſe Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:20"/>
are ſtill retain'd in the Republicks
which are now ſubſiſting in <hi>Europe;</hi>
and others have been added, by refining
too much, and aiming at more Perfection
than that ſort of Government is capable of.
I know there have been ſeveral Attempts
to ſhew, that there may be ſuch a thing as
a perfect Common-wealth: But how plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſoever the Arguments for it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Writing, they are not eaſily to be
reduc'd to Practice, ſo as to prevent the
Tyranny of <hi>The Few</hi> in an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> or
the Licentiouſneſs of <hi>The Many</hi> in a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy.</hi>
This was the Caſe of the two
principal States of <hi>Greece,</hi> upon which moſt
of the others were founded.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sparta</hi> indeed, according to the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> there was the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a limited Monarchy; but it
was too limited, firſt by the Authority of
the Senate, and afterwards of the <hi>Ephori,</hi>
who, tho' they were originally inſtituted
only as a Barrier between the Senate and
the People, ſoon became the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and were ſuperior to the Kings
in every thing but the Name. However
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:21"/>
the Government ſubſiſted long under this
Form; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth
was founded upon it, the <hi>Conſuls</hi> Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the two <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings, and the
<hi>Tribunes of the People</hi> to the <hi>Ephori.</hi> But
theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates had greater Power,
and made a worſe uſe of it, eſpecially the
<hi>Tribunes,</hi> who, under colour of protecting
the People in their juſt Rights, became
the Authors of moſt of the Seditions, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
Murthers and civil Diſcord, which
happen'd in the moſt buſy Times of the
Common-wealth. As in <hi>Sparta</hi> the Power
of the Kings was too much reſtrain'd, ſo
in <hi>Athens</hi> the Power of the People was too
exceſſive; and nothing but ſome middle
Scheme between theſe Extremes, can be
ſuppos'd to anſwer the true Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
I might from hence take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to extol the Happineſs of our own
Conſtitution, which is ſo equally poiz'd by
a due Diſtribution of Power on the one
hand, and of Liberty on the other. But
perhaps ſome may think the Boundary
Lines between them are drawn ſo fine, as
not to be eaſily perceptible; at leaſt this is
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:22"/>
the moſt plauſible Pretence for the many
Party-Diſputes among us, and the beſt way
of accounting for our frequent Alarms and
Jealouſies, leſt one Part of the Conſtitution
ſhould break in, and make Encroachments
upon the other. Theſe are bad Effects,
but they proceed from a good Cauſe; and
however ſome Particulars may be affected
by them, they have ſeldom gone ſo far,
as to endanger the Safety of the Whole:
So that notwithſtanding theſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
we are in the main much happier
than any of our Neighbours, who reproach
us with them; and our Liberty is better
ſecured to us, than it could be in any of
the Republicks of <hi>Greece,</hi> or in any of
thoſe Regal Governments in <hi>Europe,</hi> which,
tho' they were form'd upon the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
with ours, have now very little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of their original Inſtitution. I have
made a further Digreſſion from my Subject
than I intended: But in ſpeaking of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Governments, and of thoſe which
have been grafted upon them, I could not,
as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> reſiſt the Temptation of
ſaying ſomething in Preference of our own,
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:23"/>
which is certainly the neareſt to Perfection,
and is attended with very few Evils, but
ſuch as are of our own making.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Greece,</hi> I have rather
choſe to finiſh my Account of it with the
Death of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> than to carry
it on to his Succeſſor. For the Affairs of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> beſides that they are already
related by others in a fuller and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken
manner, than thoſe of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Times, are not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, to
be look'd upon as a Continuation of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Story, ſince they relate almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of the <hi>Grecians</hi> took occaſion, from
the Abſence of <hi>Alexander</hi> in his <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Expedition, to attempt the Recovery of
their Liberty; but he ſoon return'd upon
them; and by the Deſtruction of <hi>Thebes,</hi>
and the Victory afterwards obtain'd over
the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> by <hi>Antipater</hi> his Viceroy
in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he ſtruck ſuch a Terror into
the whole Country, that he kept them in
a quiet Subjection; ſo that if he had liv'd
to return again into <hi>Grecce;</hi> he would have
found it very eaſy to annex it to his own
<pb facs="tcp:0761100600:24"/>
Dominions, and to deſtroy the very Name
of it. However the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſtill ſubſiſted,
but in ſo low and lifeleſs a Condition, that
from the Time of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains, till
they were ſubdu'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> there
were very few among them, who were
diſtinguiſh'd for Arms and Counſels, and
not many for Arts and Learning: So that,
except the famous League of the <hi>Achaian</hi>
under <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to recover
the State of <hi>Sparta</hi> from the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> there is very little
worth recording.</p>

Note in each Bag, ſpecifying the Sum contain'd
in it, which <hi>Gylippus</hi> not being appris'd of, the
Fraud by this means was detected: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
either to avoid Puniſhment, or out of
Shame for having been guilty of ſo mean an
Action, he baniſh'd himſelf, and never afterwards
appear'd in <hi>Sparta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a further Conſideration in regard to
this Treaſure, whether, according to the <hi>Spartan</hi>
Laws, it ought to be received into the City.
Many of the ſobereſt and moſt diſcreet among
them oppos'd the introducing it; and they were
the more confirmed in their Opinion from this
Inſtance of <hi>Gylippus,</hi> who, they found, had been
ſo far influenc'd by Mony, as to give up every
thing elſe for it, and to ſully all the Glory of his
paſt Actions: For he was otherwiſe a Man of
great Reputation, and had acquitted himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
well in the War of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he had
the Command of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Troops: And it
was owing chiefly to him, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0761100600:30"/>
not make themſelves Maſters of that Iſland.
Hereupon the <hi>Ephori</hi> were obliged to paſs a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
that none but the old Iron Mony of the
Country ſhould be made current. But <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s
Friends would not yet give it up: They reſumed
the Debate, and got the Decree revers'd, or at leaſt
ſo far qualified, that this Mony, tho' it was to be
admitted into the City, was to be employ'd
only on publick Occaſions; and it was made
capital to convert it to any private uſe. But
this did not anſwer the Intent of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi>
which was, by prohibiting the uſe of Gold and
Silver, to reſtrain Covetouſneſs and Luxury.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves upon this occaſion, That the
ill Conſequence of Riches was not ſo effectually
prevented, by forbidding the uſe of Mony in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
as it was encouraged, by allowing it in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
That therefore this ſort of Prohibition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heighten'd their Deſires; and that, if their

Affections were tainted. Whatever was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0761100600:31"/>
it ſoften'd their Minds ſo as to prepare
them for Corruption; and in ſhort, was the firſt
great Step towards their throwing off that rugged
Virtue, which diſtinguiſh'd them ſo much from

to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who ſacrificed every thing to
his Oſtentation and Vanity, and ſtuck at no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to gratify them. He erected his own, and
ſeveral of the chief Commanders Statues in Braſs.
He was very liberal to thoſe of his Retinue,
and gave ſuch Encouragement to the Poets, that
they complimented him with Songs of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and employ'd all their Art in his Praiſes.
The <hi>Grecians</hi> in general were ſo aw'd with his
Merit, that they erected Altars to his Honour,
and ſacrificed to him as a God.</p>

their next Step was to deſire a Guard might be

their Proceedings in general; as, <hi>That it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to abridge the People in ſome meaſure of that
Liberty with which they had ſo long been pamper'd;
That all Changes of Government were attended
with Blood, and therefore it was no wonder that
they had ſo many Enemies: But that it was unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
in one of their own Order to deſert them,
and to betray that Power, which, by accepting a
Share of it, he had promiſed to maintain. Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
made ſo full and handſom a Defence, that
the Senate were inclined to favour him: Which
<hi>Critias</hi> perceiving, and knowing that, as one of
<hi>The Three Thouſand,</hi> he had a Privilege of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

That it was as eaſy to blot out any other

<hi>Critias</hi> had placed before the Bar of the Court,

he was indeed the only one among them, from

depreſs eithr: From whence his Enemies gave
him the Name of <hi>The Buskin,</hi> as it ſerves either
Foot. But his ſhifting Sides proceeded not ſo
much from the Unevenneſs of his Temper, as
from his Caution and Moderation, which made
him diſtinguiſh betwixt the Rule and the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
He had ſome time before ſhewn his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

concerned with <hi>Piſander</hi> and <hi>Antiphon</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
the Government of <hi>The Four Hundred:</hi>
And in this latter Inſtance, he ſeems to have had
ſome Plan of that kind in his view: For he
thought <hi>The Thirty</hi> too few to carry on the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
and propos'd the adding ſome
competent number to them. On the other hand,
he was as much againſt the letting in <hi>The Three

according to the mildneſs of his Nature, for
ſome middle Scheme, whereby the Power of
the Multitude might be reſtrain'd, but not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
aboliſhed. But whatever his Deſigns were,
he had not weight enough to put them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
and therefore ſell a Sacrifice to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty

Remainder of the Citizens caſt their Thought
on <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and were ſtruck with Remorſe for
their laſt ill Uſage of him. But as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
overlook'd their Peeviſhneſs, and reliev'd
them in their Extremities; ſo neither were they
now without hopes, that he might appear again
to reſcue them. And the Tyrants themſelves
were ſo apprehenſive of it, that they were very
ſolicitous to get Intelligence of all his Deſigns
and Actions. <hi>Critias</hi> at laſt repreſented to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi>
that either the Government, or <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
muſt fall; and, after many Solicitations, ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd,
that Orders were given to diſpatch him.
He reſided at that time in a ſmall Village in
<hi>Phrygia,</hi> where he was making an Intereſt with
<hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> to recommend him to his Maſter
<hi>Artaxerxes. Lyſander</hi> made it a Requeſt to
<hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> to deliver him up either alive or
dead; and laid ſuch ſtreſs upon it, that he ſeem'd
to make it a Condition of the League between
the <hi>Spartans</hi> and the <hi>Perſians.</hi> He conſented to
it, and committed the Execution to his Brother
and his Uncle; who ſurrounding the Houſe,
where he dwelt with his Miſtreſs <hi>Timandra,</hi> ſet
fire to it. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> threw in great quantities of
Clothes and Furniture to choke the Flame; then
with his Robe on his left Arm, and his Sword
in the other hand, he made his way through it:

Which the Aſſaſſins perceiving,<note place="margin">

ſlew him at a diſtance with their Darts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.
Some aſcribe this Murther to <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>
his own private Jealouſy of him; others to
the Reſentment of ſome young Noblemen whoſe
Siſter he had debauch'd. And others ſay, he had
got into the Secret of the Levy, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was
making for the Expedition againſt his Brother,
and was endeavouring, by the Diſcovery of it to
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to ingratiate himſelf with that Prince,
and to procure his Aſſiſtance for re-eſtabling the
Affairs of his Country; that therefore it became
neceſſary to take him off. But whatever Cauſe
they aſſign for his Death, they are generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
as to the manner of it; which indeed
was ſuitable to that Extravagance,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> with which
Fortune had all along treated him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhe did but ſecond the variety of Nature, who
ſeems in his Compoſition to have work'd up the
moſt jarring Contradictions, and to have tried
how far ſhe could go, in reconciling the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
of Vice and Virtue. But it is to be
doubted whether his Virtues ought, upon a ſtrict
Examination, to bear that Name; and whether
they ought not rather to be call'd extraordinary
Talents and Endowments, and Ways of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
himſelf. They had more of Artifice
and Deſign, of Popularity and Oſtentation, than
of any real Principle of Honour and juſtice, or
Love of his Country. And therefore <hi>Valcrius

was not only to procure Honour to

to keep the People employ'd, ſo that they ſhould

He likewiſe found his account in the Preſents
that were made him abroad, and in that reſpect
he was both greedy and corrupt; and yet his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them was not ſo much for the ſake of the
Mony, as to ſupport his Popularity and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
His natural bent was certainly Pleaſure; and
yet as much as he lov'd it, he made it give way
to his Ambition: But he was ſo violent, and
withal ſo irregular and capricious in the Purſuit
of it, that there was no living with him upon
any equal ſooting. He was any thing, and every

People, it muſt be confeſ'd, were no leſs une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
and inconſtant in their behaviour to him;
from whence it happen'd, that, according to
the Temper they were in, or according to the
occaſion they had for his Service, he was look'd
upon as the beſt or worſt Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and was either careſs'd and ador'd,
or deteſted and perſecuted. And yet, upon the
whole, they had ſuch an opinion of his Merit,
that tho' they were never eaſy with him, they
never thought themſelves ſafe without him. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
makes a Remark, That his Enemies could
never get the better of him but in his Abſence;
which muſt be attributed to his Subtilty and
Addreſs, and more eſpecially to the Amiableneſs
of his Perſon, and the Force of his Eloquence,
which <hi>Nepos</hi> ſays, No body could reſiſt. But
tho' by theſe means he captivated the generality
of the Citizens; yet the graveſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
among them ſaw further into the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
and were more upon their guard againſt
him. Upon this occaſion the Warning that was
given them by <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Man-hater,</hi> of what
they were to expect from him, may be worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring.
It happen'd one Day, that <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
having ſucceeded well in an Oration, the
whole Aſſembly attended to compliment him
upon it; and <hi>Timon,</hi> inſtead of avoiding him,
as he did others in the like Caſes, put himſelf in
his way, and taking him by the Hand, ſaid, <hi>Go
on boldly, my Son; may'ſt thou increaſe in Credit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0761100600:40"/>
with the People; for thou wilt one Day bring them
Calamities enough.</hi> He was ſcarce above forty
Years old when he died; by which time he had
done enough to make himſelf by turns the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and Terror, not only of his own Country,
but of ſeveral other Parts both in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi>
And he had been ſtill greater, if he had been as
careful to preſerve the People's Love, as he was
to obtain it. But the Management of Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was not his Talent: And therefore the faireſt
View of him is to be taken from his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
which, as they were often unjuſt, ſet off
his good Qualities to a greater Advantage, and
conſequently made his Fall the more lamented,
eſpecially at a time when he was ſo much wanted.
Having given a general Character of this great
Man, when I firſt mention'd him, I have here
only added ſuch further Obſervations, as were
neceſſary to illuſtrate it, and which have natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occur'd upon a more diſtinct Survey of his
Actions.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants not being able to bear the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Treatment they met with from <hi>The Thirty,</hi>
fled daily in great numbers out of the City, by
which means all <hi>Greece</hi> was overſpread with <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Exiles; till at laſt the <hi>Spartans</hi> publiſhed an
Edict, forbidding any of their Cities to receive
them; ſo that they were forced to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Argos,</hi> and ſuch other Places,
where they could live in any tolerable Security.</p>

was <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> who had done good Service in
the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War; inſomuch that <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
is ſaid to owe moſt of his Succeſs to his acting
in concert with him: But his Merit being not
of ſo glaring a kind, was in a great meaſure
eclips'd by that General, till it broke out upon
this occaſion of exerting himſelf alone, and in
ſuch a Cauſe as the Subverſion of Tyranny. At
<hi>Thebes</hi> he fell into a Conſultation with his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens;
and the Reſult was, That ſome
vigorous Effort, tho' it carried never ſo much
Danger with it, ought to be made for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the publick Liberty: Accodingly,
with a Party of Thirty Men only, as <hi>Nepos</hi> ſays;
but, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> more probably ſays, of near Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,
he ſeized upon <hi>Phyle</hi> a ſtrong Caſtle on
the Frontiers of <hi>Attica.</hi> This Enterpriſe gave
the Alarm to <hi>The Tyrants,</hi> who immediately
march'd out of the City with <hi>The Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi>
and their <hi>Spartan</hi> Guard, and attempted the
Recovery of the Place, but were repuls'd with
loſs. Finding they could not carry it by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Aſſault, they reſolved upon a Siege; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not ſufficiently provided for that Service, and
a great Snow falling that Night, they were forced
to retire the next Day into the City, leaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part of their Guard, to prevent any further
Excurſions into the Country.</p>
               <p>By this firſt Succeſs <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> had increas'd
his Followers to the number of Seven hundred;<note place="margin">His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</note> 
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0761100600:42"/>
with which he made a Sally upon the Guards, and
diſpers'd and routed them, with the Slaughter of
about an hundred and twenty. <hi>The Thirty</hi> in the
mean while, were under great Conſternation;
and for ſear of Treachery from thoſe few who
were left in the City, they forced them to
quit it. Then they fortified <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> to ſerve
them upon any ſudden Exigency, as a Place of
Retreat. And, to free themſelves from any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
the Inhabitants might give them, they
cauſed all who were able to bear Arms, to
paſs One by One, as it were upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
in order to compute the Strength of
the Garriſon, and murder'd them. At the
ſame time they attempted to corrupt <hi>Thraſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi>
and ſent under colour of treating about
Priſoners, to make him a private Offer of
ſharing with them in the Government, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Liberty of reſtoring any Ten of
the Exiles, whom he ſhould name, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he would diſmiſs the reſt, and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Meaſures. To which Propoſal he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
anſwer'd, <hi>That he look'd upon his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to be far more honourable, than the whole
Power and Dominion of</hi> The Thirty; <hi>and that be
would never put up his Sword, till all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
from every Part were receiv'd, and reſtor'd
to the Liberties derived to them from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By
this time he had got together a Body of
a thouſand Men; with which he march'd out of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0761100600:43"/>
                  <hi>Phyle</hi> by Night, and ſeiz'd on the <hi>Piraeus. The
Thirty</hi> coming with their whole Strength to the
Relief of it, he took advantage of the Ground'
made the beſt Diſpoſition of his Men, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
them of the Cauſe they were engaged
in, and the Succeſs they had hitherto met with,
and offer'd the Enemy Battle; wherein he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtain'd the Victory; which indeed was more
remarkable for the Conſequence of it, than the
Number of the Slain, wich were about Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but among them were <hi>Critias</hi> and <hi>Hippoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cbus,</hi>
two of the chief of the Tyrants.</p>
               <p>A Truce being granted for delivering up the
dead Bodies, both Sides came to a Parley; and
<hi>Thraſybulus</hi> took that occaſion to expoſtalate with
them, asking them, <hi>Why they fled from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
whom they ought rather to join as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor
of the Publick Liberty;</hi> adding, <hi>That his

And that it was at laſt extinguiſhed, is
almoſt intirely owing to the Conduct and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> who, after the ſhare he had

had the peculiar Glory of ſuppreſſing its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine

City to itſelf. And in effecting this, he ſhew'd the

were neceſſary in ſuch a Conjuncture, to appeaſe
the Minds of the People, and to reconcile them
to one another. Hence it was, that this <hi>Act</hi>
of <hi>Oblivion</hi> became a Pattern to ſucceeding

practiſed with the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and

advis'd with the</hi> Grecian <hi>Captains, and then ſpoke

want of Troops, that I have made choice of you,
but becauſe I have thought you were better to me
than a great Number of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Don't let me
be deceived in my Opinion of you; but ſhew your
ſelves worthy of that Liberty which you enjoy, and
which I think preferable to all other Poſſeſſions.
Conſider only who you have to do with, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can happen in the Engagement to diſhearten
you. The Enemy indeed is very numerous, and will
ruſh upon you with great Shouts and Acclamations;
but if you can ſtand this firſt Eclat, you your ſelves
will be aſhamed for them afterwards. If you behave
upon this Occaſion like your ſelves, and any one ſhall
afterwards deſire to return home, his Countrymen
ſhall have cauſe to look upon him with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Envy. But many of you, I believe, will
rather chooſe to ſtay with me, and accept the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
that ſhall be made you. <hi>There was a certain</hi>
Samian, <hi>who took the Liberty of telling the
Prince,</hi> That his promiſes were very large, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Danger of his Enterpriſe; but that,
after the Battle, he would forget them; or that, if
he did not, he would not have it in his Power to
perform them. <hi>To which</hi> Cyrus <hi>replied,</hi> This

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0761100600:54"/>
part of it is not habitable by reaſon of the Heat,
nor the other by reaſon of the Cold. All that lies
between theſe Two Extremes, it will be in my
Power, if I am victorious, to beſtow on my Friends.
Neither am I ſo much afraid of not having enough
to give, as of not having Men enough to give it to.
And as for you, <hi>Grecians,</hi> I promiſe to give every
Man of you a Crown of Gold. <hi>Upon which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances,
they went away very well ſatisfied,</hi>
Clearchus <hi>afterwards ask'd him, if he thought

               <p>Upon a general Review of his Army,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>He</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views his Army.</note> he
found it compoſed of Ten Thouſand and Four

Five Hundred others; and an Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of other Nations; and the Enemy, by the
Accounts they had from Deſerters, amounted to
Twelve Hundred Thouſand Men, beſides a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Body of Six Thouſand Horſe. He then
form'd his Army,<note place="margin">And forms it.</note> giving to <hi>Clearchus</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the right Wing of <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
the leſt, and march'd in order of Battle,
expecting every Hour to engage. But the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
having left a Paſs open to him, which he
thought they would have diſputed, he purſued
his March with more Security, and leſs Order,
till at laſt being arrived at the Place where he
intended to encamp, he diſcover'd the King's
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0761100600:55"/>
Army by a thick Cloud of Duſt, and prepar'd
to receive them. He order'd <hi>Clearchus</hi> to charge
directly into the Center, where the King was;
for that thereupon depended the whole Succeſs of
the Battle: But the Enemy being ſo numerous,
that one of their Wings would cover the whole
Front of <hi>Cyrus's</hi> Army, he thought it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable
to abandon the River, for ſear of being
ſurrounded by them; which <hi>Plutarch</hi> blames him
for, as having left that Service to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and
thereby occaſion'd his Death. When he had let
the Enemy advance within four or five hundred
Paces of him, the <hi>Grecians</hi> began the Hymn to
Battle,<note place="margin">The Battle.</note> and march'd up to them with great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.
But before they were got within
reach of their Javelins, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> fled, and
the <hi>Grecians</hi> after them, calling out to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not to break their Ranks in the Purſuit.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> perceiv'd the <hi>Grecians</hi> were victorious, yet
was not tranſported with it, tho' he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſaluted King by thoſe about him. At length
he diſcover'd the King his brother in the midſt
of the Battle; and for fear he ſhould fall upon
the <hi>Grecians</hi> in their Purſuit, and cut them off,
he made up directly to him with Six Hundred
Horſe, and with his own Hand kill'd <hi>Artagerſes,</hi>
who commanded the King's Six Thouſand Horſe
But when he had broke their Squadrons, all
his own People abandon'd him, except a few of
his Domeſticks, with whom he charg'd on to
the King, and crying out, <hi>I ſee him,</hi> threw a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin

The King return'd upon them in the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

again on all ſides upon the Approach of the

return'd Anſwer, <hi>That his Men were ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
for want of Proviſions; and that his Affairs
required him rather to fight, than to enter upon a

being deſperate, ſent to conduct them to ſeveral
Villages, where they found plenty of every
thing; and after Three Days Stay there, <hi>Tiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi>
came, and inſinuated to them the good
Offices he had employ'd with the King, to give
him leave to conduct them ſafe into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
that in return, they ought to acknowledge
this Favour, and not ſhew themſelves averſe to
ſuch Terms, as he could obtain for them. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
urg'd in their Defence, That they had
been engag'd in this Expedition by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Knowledge or Intention; that upon
his Death, they were now free'd from that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
and had no Deſign upon <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
or his Country, provided he did not oppoſe them
in their Return. Which <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi> agree'd to
on the King's part, that he ſhould not, and
promis'd further, That they ſhould be furniſh'd
with all neceſſary Proviſions in their March, and
that he himſelf would return with them to his
Government.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, in a few Days after, they ſet out

to an open Rupture, had a Conference with
<hi>Tiſſaphernes;</hi> wherein, among other things, he

diately admited into <hi>Tiſſaphernes</hi>'s Tent, and put
in Arreſt; the others, who were without, were
at the ſame time cut in pieces, and ſome <hi>Perſian</hi>
Horſe ſcouring the Plain, kill'd all the <hi>Grecians</hi>
they met. Amidſt this Scene of Slaughter and
Confuſion, the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſent to them a ſecond
time, in the King's Name, to lay down their
Arms, pretending that <hi>Clearchus</hi> was executed,
as having been accuſed by <hi>Proxenus</hi> and <hi>Menon</hi>
of perfidiouſly deſigning to break the Truce;
and that his Accuſers were ſent for to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King for their Diſcovery. But <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
ſuſpecting the Treachery, demanded, that
<hi>Proxenus</hi> and <hi>Menon,</hi> as being innocent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Friends to both, might be reſtored to
them, as the propereſt Perſons to adviſe them in
this Exigency. To which the <hi>Perſians,</hi> not
knowing what to reply, went away. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after, <hi>Nicarchus,</hi> one of the Captains who
had attended the Generals, came, wounded in
the Belly, and holding up his Entrails with his
Hand, to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp, and told them all
the Particulars of what had happen'd.<note place="margin">The Five <hi>Grecian</hi> Generals executed.</note> The five
Generals were ſent back to the King, who caus'd
them all to be beheaded, except <hi>Menon,</hi> who
ſuffer'd ſome other way after a Year's Torture.
It does not appear, why he was diſtinguiſhed in
this manner from the reſt; tho' indeed there was
ſome Juſtice in it in regard to his Character,
which was as extraordinary as his Treatment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0761100600:62"/>
He was by Birth a <hi>Theſſalian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Menon.</note> covetous and
ambitious; but who made his Ambition all along
ſubſervient to his Avarice, and had no other
View in his Purſuit of Honour, but to get by it.
He ſought the Friendſhip of Men in Power, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſcreen him from Puniſhment. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the readieſt way to obtain his Ends, was
by Perjury, Lying and Fraud; and took Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Openneſs for Stupidity. He loved no
body; and wherever he profeſs'd a Freindſhip,
it was in order to enſnare. He did not laugh at
his Enemies, but always made a Jeſt of his
Friends. So neither did he attempt to defraud
his Enemies of their Property, as knowing they
were too much upon their Guard againſt him:
But his Friends, who were not ſo, he fleec'd and
plunder'd. And he valued himſelf as much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Injuſtice and Falſhood, as others did upon
their Religion and Virtue: For he thought none
but Cheats were to be look'd upon as Men of
Addreſs. He made his way to Great Men by
traducing their Favourites. His manner of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
his Authority among the Troops, was
by committing the ſame Crimes with them. He
endeavour'd to make himſelf fear'd by the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
he could do you; and you were to take it
as an Obligation, that he did not do it, when it
was in his Power. He gain'd the Favour of
<hi>Ariaeus</hi> in his Youth, by abandoning himſelf to
his unnatural Paſſion; and he prevail'd the ſame
way with <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> for his Command in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0761100600:63"/>
Army. Some have imagin'd that he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
by <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and conclude from thence,
that he was engag'd in a Deſign of betraying the
<hi>Grecians</hi> to him; which, according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
might eaſily be ſuppoſed: But however,
this Account of him does not appear to be well
founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clearchus</hi> was a <hi>Spartan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </note> and eſteem'd one of
the greateſt Captains of his Time. He had done
good Servie to his Country in the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi>
War, and was intirely devoted to the Love of
Arms; inſomuch that he laid out all his Mony
in War, and with the ſame Guſt and Appetite,
with which others laid it out upon their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
Hence it was, that upon the Peace, he
deſir'd leave to go and chaſtiſe the <hi>Thracians,</hi>
who had committed ſome Inſults upon the <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſe.</hi>
Soon after he was gone, the <hi>Ephori</hi>
changed their Minds, and recall'd him; and
tho' they paſ'd Sentence of Death upon him
for diſobeying their Orders, he proceeded on his
March, beat the <hi>Thracians</hi> in a pitch'd Battle,
ravaged their Country, and continued the War,
till he enter'd into <hi>Cyrus's</hi> Service; where he was
pitch'd upon as the propereſt Man to command
the <hi>Grecians</hi> in this Expedition: And he had Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
ſuitable to ſo hardy an Undertaking. He
was ſevere in his Looks, and harſh in his Speech;
he always puniſh'd ſharply, and ſometimes in
Anger, but generally with Diſcretion. He was
very ſtrict in his Diſcipline; and it was a Saying
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0761100600:64"/>
of his, <hi>That a Soldier ought to be more afraid of
his Officer, than of his Enemy.</hi> Upon Action,
his Men deſir'd no other General; for he then
appear'd mild to them, and reſerv'd all his
Fierceneſs for the Enemy: But when the Danger
was over, he reſumed his Natural Roughneſs,
and many of them, as they found opportunity,
left him. None of them follow'd him out of
Inclination; but lived with him, as Boys do with
their School-maſters. However, he did every
thing with them by dint of Puniſhment; and
the Sum of his Character is, that he was more fit
to command, than to obey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proxenus</hi> was a <hi>Boeotian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of <hi>Proxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                  </note> and of an aſpiring
Temper, which had engaged him in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
tho' he did nothing in the Purſuit of his
Ambition, but what was conſiſtent with Honour
and Virtue. He was capable enough of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but was too much the Reverſe of <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
He had not the way of making himſelf
fear'd, where it was neceſſary: For he was more
afraid of being ill with the Soldiery, than the
Soldiery with him. He thought it ſufficient to
commend good Actions, without puniſhing the
bad: For which reaſon he was beloved by thoſe
who acted upon Principles of Honour; but bad
Men took advantage of his Eaſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agias</hi> was an <hi>Arcadian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of <hi>Agias</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Achaean;</hi>
they had both lived without Reproach, either as
to their Military, or their Civil Conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0761100600:65"/>
The <hi>Grecians</hi> had, ever ſince the Battle of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
been ſo upon their guard, and were withal
ſo bold and reſolute, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> deſpair'd
of ſubduing them by open Force, and therefore
had recourſe to this treacherous Stratagem, which
had ſo far ſucceeded, that the Loſs of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
was very near breaking and diſperſing the
whole Body. The News of it ſtruck them with
the utmoſt Conſternation: They expected every
Moment when they ſhould be attacked in their
Camp: They conſider'd that they were at the
very Gates of the King; ſurrounded with great
Rivers; in the midſt of many Nations their
Enemies; ſix or ſeven hundred Leagues from
<hi>Greece;</hi> without Officers to lead them; in want
of all manner of Proviſions, and of Means to
get any; beſides that they had no Cavalry; and
therefore if they were victorious, could not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
their Enemies; and if they ſhould happen to
be defeated, muſt every Man of them be cut off.
In theſe perplexing Thoughts they paſs'd the
Night without Sleep, deſpairing ever to ſee their
Native Country more.</p>
               <p>It was upon this Occaſion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Xenophon</hi> and others ſucceed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> that <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized
himſelf. He was an intimate Friend of
<hi>Proxenus,</hi> who had invited him into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and
preſented him to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who had alſo expreſs'd a
particular Eſteem for him; but hitherto he had
ſerved only as a Voluntier in the Army. The
next Morning he aſſembled the Officers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to them the Miſery of their Condition;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0761100600:66"/>
That they could expect no Mercy from the King,
if they fell into his Hands; to prevent which,
they had nothing to depend upon, but their own
Perſonal Bravery; and that no time ought to be
loſt in providing for their Defence. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
adviſed to chooſe new Officers in the Place
of thoſe who were murther'd, and to reſolve to
make their way home in the beſt manner they
could. Accordingly, they choſe <hi>Timaſion</hi> in the
room of <hi>Clearchus, Xanthicles</hi> in that of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Cleanor</hi> in that of <hi>Agias, Phileſius</hi> in that of
<hi>Menon,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> in that of his Friend <hi>Proxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
He having encourag'd the Army with a
long Harangue in praiſe of their Anceſtors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to them, for the Safety and Expedition of
their Return, to burn their Tents, Carriages,
and all unneceſſary Baggage, and to march in
the form of a hollow Square, that, in caſe they
ſhould be attack'd, they might be prepar'd to
receive the Enemy with a Front either way. All
which being approv'd of, <hi>Cheriſophus</hi> the <hi>Spart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

led the Van, and <hi>Timaſion</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> brought
up the Rear.</p>
               <p>They bent their March towards the Heads of
the great Rivers,<note place="margin">The <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their March.</note> in order to paſs them where
they were fordable: But they had made very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
way before they were follow'd by a Party of
the Enemies Archers and Slingers, commanded
by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> which gall'd their Rear, and
wounded ſeveral of them, who being heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd,
and without Cavalry, could make no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0761100600:67"/>
Reſiſtance. To prevent the like Inconvenience,
<hi>Xenophon</hi> furniſh'd two hundred <hi>Rhodians</hi> with
Slings, and mounted fifty more of his Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Baggage-Horſes; ſo that when <hi>Mithridates</hi>

Handful of Men, till he arrived near to the
City <hi>Lariſſa</hi> on the Banks of the <hi>Tigris.</hi>
From thence they march'd to another deſolate

they were ſupply'd from the Town. During

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0761100600:72"/>
to the Inhabitants, as a Deſign to ſubdue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave

Enterprize. However, the Noiſe of it had this
good Effect, that the Natives did what they could,
in a friendly Manner, to procure their Departure,
adviſing them to go by Sea, as the ſafeſt Way,
and furniſh'd them with a ſufficient Number of
Tranſports for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Accordingly they embark'd with a fair Wind,

but, inſtead of the Money they had alſo expected
from him, he only told them, they ſhould be

he enjoy'd it not above ſix or ſeven Days; for
no ſooner were they arriv'd at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> than the
Army depos'd him for refuſing to extort a Sum
of Money from the Inhabitants of that City;
which being a <hi>Grecian</hi> Colony, <hi>Xenophon</hi> likewiſe
refus'd to concern himſelf in that Affair; ſo that
the Army being diſappointed in their Hopes of

in the mean time receiving Advice of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
march'd to their Relief, ſetting on Fire

<hi>Byzantium,</hi> and <hi>Anaxibius,</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> Admiral,
to uſe all poſſible Means to haſten their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Accordingly <hi>Anaxibius</hi> got them out of
the City Gate, under a pretence of reviewing
them, and told them, They would meet with
Plenty of Proviſions in the <hi>Thracian</hi> Villages, and
that they ſhould proceed to the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi> where he

But they were ſo ill ſatisfied with theſe Promiſes,
that they re-enter'd the Gates in a tumultuous

Sovereignty of <hi>Greece,</hi> and had <hi>Athens</hi> in their

to make their Retreat to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> or any of
the Countries thro' which they had forc'd their

how much it would ſully the Glory of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,</hi>
That after having ſpared ſo many of the
<hi>Barbarian</hi> Cities, they had plunder'd the firſt they
came to in their own Country, and murder'd ſo
many of their Friends and Relations. This Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
had ſo good an effect, that they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
chang'd their Reſolution, and march'd
out of the City without committing the leaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
which was intirely owing to <hi>Xenophon,</hi>
who to the Courage and Conduct he had ſhewn
in every Circumſtance of the <hi>Retreat,</hi> had added
this extraordinary Inſtance of his Mildneſs and
Humanity, and the Force of his Eloquence. And
this was teſtified of him at large in a Letter from
<hi>Chio,</hi> a Philoſopher then in the Town, to a Friend
of his, wherein he tells him, <hi>He had been an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs
of the Skill and Temper, with which</hi> Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon
<hi>had allay'd the Fury of the Soldiers; that he
could not forbear going to thank him as the Author
of his Deliverance, and was ſtruck with the Sight of
a Man, who had nothing terrible or ſevere in his
Looks, but entertain'd him in the moſt meek and
agreeable Manner on ſeveral Subjects, and who knew
ſo well how to reduce Philoſophy to Practice.</hi>

and a third ſpoke to the ſame Purpoſe. He made
it appear in his Anſwer to this Charge, that he

it with ſuch Exactneſs and Fidelity, and at the
ſame time with ſuch Modeſty in regard to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that the only Doubt remaining, is, whether
he gain'd more Honour by the Share he had in
the Expedition, or by the Account he has given
of it.</p>
               <p>But it is time now to return to <hi>Greece,</hi> which
we left chiefly under the Direction of the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
who contenting themſelves with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the ſeveral States to them at home,
were meditating other great Deſigns, and reſolv'd
to puſh their Conqueſts abroad. The firſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that offer'd, was from the <hi>Ionians:</hi> They
were afraid of the Power of <hi>Tiſſaphernes,</hi> who, as
a Reward for the Service he had done <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
in the late War with his Brother <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had the
Government of all the Cities he had poſſeſſed in
thoſe Parts, conferr'd on him; and therefore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0761100600:80"/>
they begg'd Aſſiſtance from <hi>Sparta</hi> to ſupport
them in their Liberties. Their Requeſt was eaſily
granted; and a Body of Five Thouſand Men,
with Three Hundred <hi>Athenian</hi> Horſe, were ſent
to them, under the Command of <hi>Thimbron,</hi> who
appear'd among them, but would not venture to
take the Field, till he was join'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> at <hi>Pergamus;</hi> with
which Forces he took that, and ſeveral other ill-fortified
Towns, and then laid Siege to <hi>Lariſſa.</hi>
But before he could take it, he was recall'd by
the <hi>Ephori,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thimbron</hi> recall'd, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</note> and baniſh'd, for having ſuffer'd the
Soldiers to pillage the Countries of their Allies;
and was ſucceeded in the Command by <hi>Dercyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athens,</hi>
during the Time of <hi>the Expedition of
the Ten Thouſand,</hi> and the breaking out of this
freſh War in <hi>Aſia,</hi> was very quiet with its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and endeavouring to recover itſelf from its
late Confuſions in the Government at home. But
there were ſtill ſome Seeds of Rancour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
left among the Citizens, which, two Years
after the Expulſion of <hi>the Thirty,</hi> broke out upon
<hi>Socrates,</hi> and occaſion'd his Death. The chief
Inſtrument in it was <hi>Anytus,</hi> who engag'd <hi>Melitus</hi>
and <hi>Lycon</hi> to join with him in accuſing him to the
State. Accordingly <hi>Melitus</hi> drew up his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Socrates <hi>accus'd</hi>
                  </note> containining in Subſtance, <hi>That he did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Gods of the Republick, but introduced
new Deities in their room;</hi> and further, <hi>That he
corrupted the Youth.</hi> He urg'd in his Defence,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0761100600:81"/>
That he had aſſiſted,<note place="margin">His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> as others did, at the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and ſolemn Feſtivals, and appeal'd to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus</hi>
himſelf for the Truth of it. He denied his
endeavouring to eſtabliſh any new Worſhip: He
own'd indeed, he had receiv'd frequent Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
from a <hi>Divine Voice,</hi> which he call'd his
<hi>Daemon,</hi> that conſtantly attended him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
to him Things to come; that he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
made uſe of this Divine Aſſiſtance for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of himſelf and his Friends: But that if he
had been thus particularly favour'd from Heaven,
it was owing chiefly to the Regularity of his Life
and Conduct; and that the Approbation of the
Gods, which was given him as the Reward of his
Virtue, ought not to be objected to him as his
Crime. Then as to the other Article, wherein
he was branded with a criminal Paſſion for young
Men, he ſaid, He had no other View in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with them, than to regulate their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;
that as he could not do this with any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority, he was therefore forc'd to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
himſelf into their Company, and to uſe in
a manner the ſame Methods to reclaim, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did to corrupt them.</p>
               <p>How far the whole Charge affected him, is not
eaſy to determine. It is certain, that amidſt ſo
much Zeal and Superſtition as then reign'd in
<hi>Athens,</hi> he never durſt openly oppoſe the receiv'd
Religion, and was therefore forc'd to preſerve an
outward Shew of it: But it is very probable,
from the Diſcourſes he frequently held with his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0761100600:82"/>
Friends, that in his Heart he deſpis'd and laugh'd
at their monſtrous Opinions, and ridiculous Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
as having no other Foundation, than the
Fables of the Poets; and that he had attain'd to
a Notion of the <hi>One, Only, True God;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that, upon the account both of his Belief of
the Deity, and the Exemplarineſs of his Life,
ſome have thought fit to rank him with the
<hi>Chriſtian Philoſophers.</hi> And indeed his Behaviour
upon his Trial, was more like that of a <hi>Chriſtian
Martyr,</hi> than of an <hi>Impious Pagan;</hi> where he
appear'd with ſuch a compos'd Confidence, as
naturally reſults from Innocence, and rather, as
<hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves, as if he were to determine upon
his Judges, than to ſupplicate them as a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
               <p>But
how ſlight ſoever the Proofs were againſt
him, the Faction was powerful enough to find
him guilty. There was the Form of a Proceſs
againſt him, and his Irreligion was the Pretence
upon which it was grounded; but his Death was
certainly a concerted thing. His ſteady uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Courſe of obſtinate Virtue, which had
made him in many Caſes appear ſingular, and
oppoſe whatever he thought illegal or unjuſt,
without any Regard to Times, or Perſons, had
procur'd him a great deal of Envy and Ill-will:
Inſomuch that he had, ſeveral Years before, been
publickly attack'd upon the Stage in the <hi>Play,</hi>
call'd <hi>The Clouds,</hi> where he is introduc'd as the
Author of many groſs Impieties; which ſome
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0761100600:83"/>
ſay, <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> wrote out of a perſonal Pique to
him; others, that he did it only according to the
Liberty then indulg'd to the Stage, and intended,
in the Perſon of <hi>Socrates,</hi> to expoſe and ridicule
the Philoſophers in general. But moſt are of
Opinion, that it was at the Inſtigation of <hi>Anytus,</hi>
who look'd upon him as a dangerous Man, and
took that Method of preparing the People for his
Condemnation, whenever an Opportunity ſhould
offer. This agrees with the Terms propoſed to
him, even after the Accuſation was given in, when
perhaps he was not ſure of carrying his Point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: He hinted to him, that if he would
talk leſs freely, and not take upon him to cenſure
and arraign the Adminiſtration, he would yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſtifle the Affair, and ſave him. It
was upon the ſame Account, that he was forbid
converſing with the young Men: Thoſe at the
Helm were jealous of his tampering with them in
relation to the Government; and this ſeems to be
the Grounds of that Part of his Accuſation. But
he was not to be bought by Bribes, or deter'd by
Menaces; in ſhort, he had more Plainneſs and
Integrity than the Times would bear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fell a Sacrifice to the Corruption of thoſe,
whom his Honeſty had made his Enemies.</p>
               <p>It was a Privilege in <hi>Athens,</hi> after Conviction,
to demand a Mitigation of the Puniſhment: But
that, he ſaid, would be owning himſelf guilty;
and he choſe rather to defy and incenſe his
Judges; ſo that they unanimouſly paſs'd Sentence
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0761100600:84"/>
of Death upon him,<note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,</note> by drinking the Juice of

ſome thought to have been the Author of this

againſt that King perſonally. But the Accounts
of both theſe Hiſtorians, in that Reſpect, are too
confuſed and inconſiſtent, to be reconciled with
others, or even with themſelves: Neither can
we, with any Certainty, affirm that he appear'd
in Action, till after <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> had quitted <hi>Aſia.</hi>
We may however conclude, that he was before
that, making uſe of his Credit at the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Court, to procure an Armament at Sea, and
that he was at leaſt very inſtrumental, if not
principally concerned, in forming a Confederacy

where in earneſt, when they moved againſt
them as one Soul and Body, when they laid aſide
all domeſtick Diſſenſions, to purſue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy; and, in ſhort, acted upon no
other Principle than the Love of Liberty, and
the Defence of their Country. This was the
plain, hardy and untainted Age of <hi>Greece,</hi>
which might have been of a much longer Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
if its Inhabitants had contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the Glory they had acquired at home.
But theſe Succeſſes ſoon fired them with an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of making themſelves more formidable,
by enlarging their Bounds, and extending their
Conqueſts: So that by throwing themſelves out
in Colonies, and carrying their Arms abroad,
they had a freer Converſe with other Nations:
And as by this means they arrived to quicker
degrees of Knowledge and Politeneſs; ſo on the
other hand, they became more luxurious and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate,
and more open to the Charms and
Temptations of Riches. They received the firſt
Impreſſions of this kind from the Footing they
got in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where they were ſtruck and dazzled
with the Pomp, Wealth and Magnificence of
the <hi>Perſian</hi> Governors: And tho' in all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they had there, they ſtill behaved like <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
and with a Senſe of Glory; yet they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
too great an Eagerneſs to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Plunder. In ſhort, the Love of
Mony was now rooted in their Affections; and
it ſoon after viſibly appeared in the Effects it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0761100600:96"/>
produced. For as the <hi>Grecians</hi> had been bribed
to quit their Pretenſions in <hi>Aſia;</hi> ſo others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made uſe of the ſame Methods to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<hi>Greece:</hi> And this will appear in the Sequel
of the Story, to be one of the principal Cauſes
of its total Subverſion. As the <hi>Spartans</hi> kept
up longeſt to the Rigour of their Diſcipline,
and the Force of their Laws, they were a great
while proof againſt Corruption and Bribery;
but the Contagion ſtill ſpreading, they at laſt
yielded to the Example of their Neighbours.
It was then <hi>Greece</hi> became ſo divided and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
as to admit of no means for its Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
when not only each State, but alſo the
leading Men in that State, had ſeparate Views
of their own, without any regard to the Good of
the Whole.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans,</hi>

to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Intereſt, ſo they were the moſt
active in promoting it. To ſtrengthen their
Alliance, they ſent Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
with a long Repreſentation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſture of Affairs; wherein they artfully
inſinuated their Zeal and Affection to their
State; from thence they took occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
againſt the Tyranny of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with telling them, That now was the
Time to throw off the Yoke, and to recover
their former Splendor and Authority. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
tho' they had no Share of the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Mony, needed not many Arguments to engage
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0761100600:97"/>
them in a Rupture of this kind, for which they
had been ſo long waiting a fit Opportunity.</p>
               <p>The firſt Act of Hoſtility broke out between
the <hi>Locri Opuntii,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſtilities begun.</note> and the <hi>Phocians,</hi> upon a
Diſpute about a piece of Ground; and both
Sides appeal'd to their reſpective Confederates
for Juſtice and Protection. The <hi>Locri</hi> were the
Aggreſſors, at the Inſtigation of the <hi>Thebans;</hi>
and the <hi>Spartans</hi> eſpouſed the latter, upon a
particular Pique they had to <hi>Thebes,</hi> which they
thought it neceſſary to reſent at this time, when
they found ſeveral other States arming againſt
them. Accordingly, they ordered <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to
march with the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Forces, and ſent
<hi>Lyſander</hi> before to engage other Cities in <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
where having got together a conſiderable
Army, he inveſted <hi>Haliartus.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
marched with their whole Strength;
and taking the Advantage of attacking him,
before <hi>Pauſanias</hi> could come up to his Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
defeated his Army,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lyſander</hi> kill'd.</note> and he himſelf was

               <p>Thus fell this great Man,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> after ſo many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Services to his Country, in giving <hi>Athens</hi> the
moſt fatal Blow ſhe had ever received; and in
raiſing <hi>Sparta</hi> upon her Ruins, to a higher Pitch
of Power and Grandeur than ſhe ever attain'd,
either before or after him. As it was by his
means, that <hi>Sparta</hi> did at this time, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
give Law both to <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> ſo he
himſelf became no leſs abſolute in <hi>Sparta,</hi> than
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0761100600:98"/>
ſhe was among her Enemies and Allies. The
Authority of her Kings was ſufficiently abridged
by the Conſtitution: but by his working Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
and the Intereſt he had in the State upon
the Reputation of his Services, he made them
appear ſtill leſs, and that in the Field too, where
they were leaſt ſubject to be controuled. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of which we have in his going with <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi>
into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where all the Court and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made to him; and in every thing that
paſs'd of moment, he had either the firſt hand,
or the finiſhing Stroke: Inſomuch that the King
found himſelf obliged to take notice of it; and
that he might no longer appear a Cypher, ſent
him upon other Service to the <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it enough for him to eclipſe the Power
of the Kings, and to impoſe his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Ten Men</hi> upon all the <hi>Spartan</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts;
but he was further endeavouring to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Succeſſion of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> in order to
obtain the Sovereignty for himſelf. As a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of this, there was found among his
Papers after his Death, <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the
Government,</hi> which <hi>Lacratidas</hi> generouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
ſaying, <hi>It would be inhumane to dig</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander
<hi>out of his Grave.</hi> He was undoubtedly a
brave experienc'd Commander: But his Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
Craft and Treachery, his Ambition,
Arrogance and Oſtentation, make up the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of his Character; and therefore it may
ſeem pretty extraordinary, that he ſhould ſupport
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0761100600:99"/>
himſelf ſo long under ſo jealous and auſtere a
Government, as that of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But he had a
great deal of Artifice and Addreſs; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Imperiouſneſs of his Temper, he
knew how to curb it upon occaſion, and to ſuit
it to his Circumſtances: So that where he found
it neceſſary to make his Court, he was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Manners of his Country, very mild
and tractable, patient and ſubmiſſive, and had
all the little Arts of Flattery and Inſinuation.
It was with regard to theſe ſupple Qualities, as
well as to the Badneſs of his Morals in general,
that the Character of his Countryman <hi>Callicrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
has been ſet up in oppoſition to his; and
indeed it was quite the Reverſe of it, except in
the Military Part; and in that he was no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to him: But he was otherwiſe open, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
and generous, modeſt, temperate, ſincere
and juſt, and was above making uſe of any Trick
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or Subterfuge. <hi>Lyſander</hi> was ſo jealous of his
Merit, that when he was order'd to give up the
Command of the Fleet to him, he did what he
could to leſſen and diſtreſs him: He went ſo far
as to withold from him the Pay of the Seamen
that was remaining in his Hands; which, beſides
the Meanneſs of the Action, was betraying the
Intereſt of his Country, and hazarding the Safety
of it in a very critical Conjuncture. Upon the
whole, notwithſtanding his great Atchievements,
he is not to be look'd upon as a true Patriot.
For it ſeems chiefly owing to him, that the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0761100600:100"/>
                  <hi>Spartans</hi> tranſgreſs'd the juſt Bounds of Power he
had put into their Hands. It was his Pride and
Inſolence, his cruel and tyrannical Deportment,
and that under the Pretence of reſtoring Liberty,
which gave their Neighbours the firſt Impreſſions
of Rancour and Reſentment againſt them. It
was this that made them conceive an ill Opinion
of their Government in general, and laid the
Seeds of thoſe Alliances, which were form'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and which at laſt prov'd fatal to
them. But they were not yet ſo ſenſible of the
Conſequences; and therefore paid all due Reſpect
to his Memory. They went ſo far as to fine
ſome who were under a Contract of Marriage to
his Daughters, but finding, that their Father died
ſo poor as to leave them no Fortune, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
them. It is certain, he had reſerv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to himſelf out of the Spoils of the <hi>Atti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

War; which to the <hi>Spartans</hi> was a ſufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his Merit. A ſtronger Inſtance of the
Senſe they had of his Loſs, was, that they could
pitch upon nobody but <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to ſucceed him;
who, notwithſtanding that he was carrying on the
War in <hi>Aſia</hi> with good Succeſs, was immediately
recall'd to the Defence of his Country.</p>
               <p>After the Action <hi>Pauſanias</hi> came up, but durſt

the Government of <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and at
<hi>Daſcyllum,</hi> his Winter Quarters, took and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his Tent. But that Governor ſome time
after manag'd an Interview with him, wherein
he remonſtrated, That however he might be
oblig'd to act for his Maſter's Honour, and
Safety, he had not ſhew'd himſelf an Enemy to
the <hi>Spartans,</hi> but on the contrary had done them
many good Offices in their War againſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians;</hi>
and that he was now inclin'd to act no

to it, in order to ſupport himſelf in his
Command; by which Means he prevail'd with
<hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to withdraw his Forces out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
Thereupon he deſcended into the Plain
of <hi>Thebes;</hi> and as he was preparing to march
further into the Country, receiv'd News of the
War broke out in <hi>Greece,</hi> with Orders at the
ſame time for him to return home; with which
he readily comply'd.<note place="margin">Ageſilaus <hi>recall'd from</hi> Aſia. Olymp. 96. 3.</note> And the Regard he therein
paid to the Laws of his Country, is particularly

the War with great Increaſe of Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and had ſet his Heart upon the entire
Conqueſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, he had ſo much
Command of himſelf, as to ſtop in his full Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer,
and abandon all, out of a Deference to the
<hi>Ephori,</hi> who had recall'd him. However, he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0761100600:102"/>
left Four Thouſand Men in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to maintain the
Footing he had got there, till ſuch time as the
Affairs of <hi>Greece</hi> would permit him to return,
and purſue his Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Spartans</hi> could not wait his Arrival;
they found the War thicken on their Hands, and
were ready to be attack'd on all Sides. <hi>Timolous</hi>
a <hi>Corinthian</hi> propos'd the advancing immediately
into their Territories, in order to cruſh them

<hi>They ſet out,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>by themſelves only;

latter whereof does not ſeem very probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we find no further Mention made of him,
either in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Perſia.</hi> So that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
he died about this Time, and that he fell
a Sacrifice to his own ill-tim'd Zeal for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Country;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conon</hi>'s Death, and Character.</note> which certainly carried him
further than was ſuitable to the Circumſtances he
was under. He had lived as a voluntary Exile
among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had given him their
Protection and Aſſiſtance; he had been favour'd
and truſted by them; he had, by intereſting' em
in his Quarrel, broke the Power of <hi>Sparta</hi> at Sea,
and repair'd the Ruins of his own City, and both
at their Charge and Hazard. But not content
with this, he was at the ſame time practiſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and endeavouring under-hand to
withdraw from them ſeveral Cities, and the whole
Provinces of <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Aeolia,</hi> in order to annex
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0761100600:110"/>
them to the Dominions of <hi>Athens;</hi> and all this
under a Pretence of reſcuing them from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and ſecuring them to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi>
They could not, when they were let into
a Diſcovery of theſe Artifices, think he had made
a ſuitable Return for what he ow'd them; nor
indeed can this Part of his Character be otherwiſe
juſtified, than by that falſe Principle, which had
generally obtain'd among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to give
up every thing that interfered with what they
call'd the Honour, or Advantage of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
This was carried ſo far, as, in ſome Caſes,
to deſtroy the common Diſtinctions of Right and
Wrong; and the <hi>Spartans</hi> themſelves, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their ſevere Juſtice in other Reſpects,
were ſo looſe in this particular, that nothing was
eſteem'd baſe, that was beneficial. Another
Motive for his exerting himſelf in ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
a manner, might be in order to redeem his
own Honour, which does not ſeem to ſtand quite
clear in the Affair of <hi>Aegos-potamos. Nepos</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſays, he was abſent from his Command at
the Time of that Engagement; and aſſigns that
as the Cauſe of the Defeat. But the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and authentick Account is, that he was
preſent in the Action, but that being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
by <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of Succeſs on his Side, made his Eſcape with
eight or nine Ships, and retir'd to <hi>Cyprus.</hi> This
agrees with what is further ſaid of him, that
he was afraid and aſham'd to return to <hi>Athens;</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0761100600:111"/>
which it is plain he did not attempt till ſeveral
Years after, when he had done enough to wipe
off that Stain. The latter Part of his Life was
certainly without Reproach, either as to his
Courage, or Capacity; of both which he had
given ſufficient Proofs, and had made himſelf ſo
formidable to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> that they were glad
upon any Terms to get rid of him; and it was
by the moſt abject Submiſſion to the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
that they compaſs'd it. The Dread they had
conceiv'd of him, ſeems to have been the Grounds
of that ſcandalous Peace, which they ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
concluded: And as they began from that
Day forward to decline in their Reputation and
Power, we may look upon <hi>Conon</hi> as having more
remotely occaſion'd their DownfaI.</p>
               <p>Upon the Offers of Peace made to <hi>Teribazus,</hi>
he went up to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to give an Account
of his Proceedings, and to receive freſh Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
In the mean time <hi>Struthas</hi> was ſent to
command in the <hi>Lower Aſia,</hi> and to take care
of the Sea-Coaſts. He was not ſo well inclin'd
to the <hi>Spartans</hi> as his Predeceſſor, being more
exaſperated at what had been done by <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi>
Whereupon they ſent <hi>Thimbron</hi> with a good Body
of Troops to keep him in Action; which he did
at firſt with good Succeſs; but ranging about
with a ſeparate Party in queſt of Booty, was
ſurpriz'd by <hi>Struthas,</hi> and kill'd. He was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

               </p>
               <p>There were at this Time two contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

there; and they were ſupported by their
reſpective Patrons, thoſe for the <hi>Democracy</hi> by
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the others for the <hi>Oligarchy</hi>
by the <hi>Spartans.</hi> The latter being over-power'd,
and forc'd off the Iſland, made their Complaints
at <hi>Sparta;</hi> and <hi>Ecdicus</hi> was diſpatch'd with eight
Ships to their Relief. But finding himſelf too
weak to do any thing to the Purpoſe, <hi>Teleutias</hi>
the Admiral was ſent with twenty-ſeven Sail,
with which he reſtor'd the Exiles, and the <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy.</hi>
This was a Matter of too much Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be given up. They
were ſenſible how much their Sovereignty in the
Iſland (which was truly the Point in Queſtion)
depended on the Form of Government, which
ſhould prevail in it; and therefore ſent out <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſybulus</hi>
to put Things upon the former footing.
Before he durſt attempt any thing at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he
went into <hi>Thrace,</hi> where he gain'd over two
<hi>Perſian</hi> Princes to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Intereſt; he then
took in <hi>Byzantium, Chalcis,</hi> and ſeveral other
Cities upon the <hi>Helleſpont;</hi> and from thence he
went to chaſtiſe the <hi>Lesbians,</hi> who were all of
them, except thoſe of <hi>Mitylene,</hi> in the <hi>Spartan</hi>
Intereſt. Having ſucceeded thus far, he ſail'd
towards <hi>Rhodes.</hi> He had in his Way levied a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0761100600:113"/>
Sum of Mony for Contribution upon the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Aſpendus:</hi> But they being afterwards
ill treated by his Soldiers, roſe in a great Fury,

               </p>
               <p>Such was the End of this great Patriot, to
whom <hi>Athens</hi> ow'd as ſignal a Deliverance, as
any ſhe had receiv'd in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Wars. We
need only conſider her Condition under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of <hi>The Thirty;</hi> when of thoſe who had
eſcap'd the Fate of a long War, ſome had been
murder'd, others baniſh'd, and their Eſtates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated;
when the City was one continu'd Scene
of Outrage and Violence; and when thoſe few
good Men who ſtill remain'd, and expreſs'd a
Senſe of recovering the publick Liberty, yet
choſe rather to content themſelves with talking
of it, than really to attempt it: Yet even then
did <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> riſe in a manner ſingly againſt
the united Power of the Oppreſſors. It having
been already related with what Prudence, Zeal
and Intrepidity he conducted that Affair, I will
here only add an Obſervation which has been
made, that the Succeſs of this Enterprize was
chiefly owing to its deſperateneſs. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
with which <hi>The Thirty</hi> treated it in the
Beginning, made them neglect the proper Means
of providing for their Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fety. <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> in the
mean time went on with his Deſign, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
his Followers: And when they ſound
him in a Condition to make head againſt them,
they thought fit to make him an Offer of ſharing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0761100600:114"/>
in the Tyranny with them, upon Condition he
would deſiſt. But it was not to be ſuppos'd, that
one who had the Courage to project ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and who had advanc'd it ſo far, would
hearken to any other Terms, than the entirely
reſtoring the Freedom of his Country. His pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-ſpiritedneſs,
together with his Fidelity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and Magnanimity, made him at leaſt
equal to the greateſt Men of his Time. There
were ſeveral indeed, whoſe Atchievements hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd

But none of them had a more real Foundation
of Merit. And therefore <hi>Nepos</hi> ſays of him,
<hi>That if Virtue were to be conſider'd abſtractedly

of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> was in Revenge for their

Some other little States they treated leſs rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,

and Controul, as plainly ſhew'd, they expected

a little ſanguine in their Intereſt, they would, in
ſome Caſes, redreſs their Grievances, reſtore their
Exiles, compoſe their Differences, and do ſuch
other popular Acts of Juſtice, as to make them
think, they were executing the Treaty to their
Advantage, and that they were the Authors of
their Liberty. And among the greater States,
they had oblig'd the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to withdraw
their Garriſon from <hi>Argos;</hi> which, with their
freeing the <hi>Boeotian</hi> Cities, and ſome other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

prov'd to be of more Conſequence to the Affairs

two of the Polemarchs, or Governors of the
City; and the latter being in the <hi>Spartan</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and finding, that he could not otherwiſe get

call'd <hi>Cadmea,</hi> to <hi>Phaebidas;</hi> then ſeiz'd <hi>Iſmenias,</hi>
and forc'd his Party, to the Number of Four
Hundred, to fly to <hi>Athens</hi> for Refuge. This
made a great Noiſe there, and in the other Parts
of <hi>Greece;</hi> and even at <hi>Sparta</hi> they were ſo
aſham'd of it, that they pretended to reſent it;
for they were ſenſible the <hi>Thebans</hi> had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Violation of the Treaty, ſince they had
ſubmitted to it; that their domeſtick Diſſenſions
did not concern the Publick; and that <hi>Phaebidas</hi>
had no Authority to intermeddle in them.
But this Action was excus'd by <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who
was ſuppos'd to be at the Bottom of the Deſign.
He conſider'd it in no other Light, than as it was
of Advantage to the Common-wealth; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
his Opinion, <hi>That if it anſwer'd in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

done.</hi> He added further, in Behalf of <hi>Phaebidas,
That in an Enterprize of that Nature, Orders were
not to be expected.</hi> This way of reaſoning ſo far
prevail'd with the <hi>Spartan</hi> Government, that they
avow'd and juſtify'd the Action, tho' at the ſame

had, contrary to all Faith and Treaties, ſeiz'd the

but did not withdraw their Garriſon; as if, ſays
he, that Puniſhment could wipe out the Injuſtice

they proclaim'd publickly, they would reſtore all
the Cities to their Liberties, and yet did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

Aſſociates divided themſelves into two Bands;
one of which, led by <hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Mellon,</hi> were
to attack <hi>Archias,</hi> and his Company. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put on Womens Cloaths over their Armour,
with Pine and Poplar over their Heads, to ſhade
their Faces, they took their Opportunity,
when the Gueſts were well heated with Wine,
to enter the Room, and immediately ſtabb'd
<hi>Archias</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> with ſuch others of the
Company, as were pointed out to them by
<hi>Phyllidas.</hi> A little before this Execution, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
received an Expreſs from <hi>Athens,</hi> with all
the Particulars of the Conſpiracy; and the
Courier conjured him in the Name of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who wrote the Letters, that he ſhould read
them forthwith; for that they contain'd Matter
of great Importance. But he laid them by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>open'd,
and with a Smile ſaid, <hi>Buſineſs to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi>
which Words upon that Occaſion grew
into a Proverb.</p>
               <p>The other Band, headed by <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and
<hi>Damoclides,</hi> went to attack <hi>Leontiades,</hi> who was
at home, and in Bed. They ruſh'd into his
Houſe by Surpriſe; but he ſoon taking the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm,
leap'd up, and, with his Sword in his
Hand, received them at his Chamber-door, and
ſtabb'd <hi>Cephiſodorus,</hi> who was the firſt Man
that attempted to enter. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was the next
who encounter'd him, and after a long and
difficult Diſpute, kill'd him. From thence they
went in purſuit of <hi>Hypates</hi> his Friend and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0761100600:128"/>
and diſpatch'd him likewiſe. After which
they join'd the other Band, and ſent to haſten the
Exiles they had left in <hi>Attica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole City was by this time fill'd with
Terror and Confuſion; the Houſes full of Lights,
and the Inhabitants running to and fro in the
Streets in a wild diſtracted manner, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatiently for Day-light, that they might
diſtinguiſh their Friends from their Foes, and
determine what courſe to take. Early in the
Morning the Exiles came in arm'd; and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas</hi>
appear'd with his Party in a General
Aſſembly of the People, encompaſs'd by the
Prieſts carrying Garlands in their Hands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
Liberty to the <hi>Thebans</hi> in general, and
exhorting them to fight for their Gods and
their Country. For tho' they had made ſuch a
proſperous Beginning, the moſt difficult Part ſtill
remain'd, whilſt the Citadel was in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> with a Garriſon of fifteen
hundred Men, beſides a great Number of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and others, who had fled to them for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and declared themſelves on their Side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who is very particular in the firſt Part
of this Tranſaction, which has been related chiefly
from him, paſſes over the taking the Citadel
too ſlightly. He only ſays, that <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> with
<hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Mellon,</hi> block'd it up, attack'd it,
and got poſſeſſion of it, before any Succours
could arrive from <hi>Sparta.</hi> But it is not probable,
that ſhould be the Work of a Day, or that it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0761100600:129"/>
ſhould have been effected with ſo ſmall a Force:
And therefore this Part is to be ſupplied from
<hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who ſays, that the <hi>Athenians</hi>
early the next Morning after, ſent five thouſand
Foot, and two thouſand Horſe to <hi>Pelopidas</hi>'s
Aſſiſtance, and that ſeveral other Bodies of
Troops came in from all the Cities of <hi>Boeotia,</hi>
to the Number of ſeven thouſand; that the
Caſtle being beſieged by this Army held out for
ſeveral Days, but ſurrender'd at laſt for want of
Proviſions. Others ſay, they capitulated more
out of Fear than Neceſſity, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
at his Return to <hi>Sparta,</hi> was put to
death for it. However the Citadel, upon which
the whole depended, was recovered; and as the
gaining that reſtored the <hi>Thebans</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Liberty, ſo it was the Foundation of their
future Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>This Action bore ſo near a Reſemblance to
that of <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> whether we conſider the
Courage of the Actors, the Hazards and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the Undertaking, the Manner in which
it was conducted, or the Succeſs and Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with which it was attended, that it was
called <hi>Its Siſter.</hi> And <hi>Pelopidas</hi> propoſed that
Enterpriſe as a Pattern to the Exiles, when he
exhorted them not to content themſelves with
living in a lazy Dependence on the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
and to fawn for fear upon every ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongu'd
Orator, but to exert themſelves like
<hi>Thraſybulus;</hi> and that, as he had advanced from

               <p>The <hi>Spartans</hi> were ſo enraged, and ſo far
from giving up their uſurped Dominion, that
they ſent their King <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> in the Depth

They were as remarkable for their Fidelity and

Affection to one another, as they were for their
Courage, and in that reſpect were likewiſe call'd,
<hi>The Band of Lovers.</hi> There are ſeveral fabulous
Accounts concerning them: But all that can be
reaſonably collected from them, is, that they
were a brave determin'd Set of young Men, who
had vow'd perpetual Friendſhip, and ſworn to
ſtand by one another to the laſt Drop of their
Blood. They were ſaid to have been firſt rais'd
by <hi>Gorgidas,</hi> who was one of the Governors of
<hi>Boeotia,</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and had a
conſiderable Share in the Tranſactions of that
Time. He us'd them chiefly as a Guard to the
Citadel, but employ'd them occaſionally in other
Services of the War; and upon an Engagement,
he choſe to divide and mix them in the Ranks
with the other Troops, in order to animate them
by their Example. But <hi>Pelopidas</hi> found a better
Effect in keeping them in one entire Body; and
after the Proofs they had given him of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
in this Action, he conſtantly charg'd at
the Head of them, in the ſame manner, without
breaking and diſperſing them. They are ſaid to
have remain'd invincible till the Battle of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronea,</hi>
which happen'd ſome Years after, when
they were every Man of them cut down by the
<hi>Macedonian Phalanx:</hi> And the next Day <hi>Philip</hi>
taking a View of the Field of Battle, look'd on
them with Surpriſe, as they lay all together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Slain, and extolling their Virtue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

It was this Battle of <hi>Tegyra,</hi> ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
which firſt convinc'd the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that the Breed
of martial Spirits is not confin'd to the Banks of
the <hi>Eurotas;</hi> but that true Courage and Bravery
are the Growth of every Country, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are brought up with a Senſe of Honour

               <p>Theſe Succeſſes of the <hi>Thebans</hi> made the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
begin to think they gain'd Ground a little

had againſt <hi>Sparta,</hi> they did not care to carry it
ſo far, as to raiſe the Power of one State upon the

inclin'd them towards an Accomodation. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd

of their Forces againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> maintain'd

attended with Delays, which were chiefly
occaſion'd by their Generals Hands being tied
up, ſo that, upon any ſudden Emergency, they
often waited for Inſtructions from their Court, till
the Occaſion was over. And this was alledg'd
by <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> in his Excuſe to <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> who
expoſtulating with him upon the Operations of

The firſt Conteſts were concerning <hi>Zacynthus</hi>

                  </note> which were occaſion'd chiefly by
the <hi>Spartan</hi> Faction. In the former of theſe
Places, the People had expell'd their Magiſtrates;
who flying to <hi>Timotheus</hi> for Protection, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them on board his Fleet, and tranſported
them back to the Iſland; where, by his further
Aſſiſtance, they got Poſſeſſion of a ſtrong Caſtle,
and maintain'd themſelves againſt the Inhabitants.
The like Diviſions ſubſiſting in <hi>Corcyra,</hi> the
<hi>Spartans</hi> ſent out <hi>Mnaſippus</hi> with a Fleet, under
colour of aſſiſting their Friends there. But they
knew of what Importance that Iſland was to the
Recovery of their Dominion at Sea; and their
true Deſign was to ſecure it to themſelves. The
Fraud being detected, the Inhabitants in general
united againſt them as their common Enemy, and
put themſelves under the Protection of <hi>Athens.</hi>
But before they could receive any Relief from
thence, the <hi>Spartans</hi> had landed upon them, and
beſieged them. And when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtraiten'd for want of Proviſions, they made
a deſperate ſally, wherein they kill'd <hi>Mnaſippus,</hi>
with a good Number of his Men. At length

and put an end to theſe Commotions.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Inhabitants of <hi>Plataêa</hi>
applying to their old Friends the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for

were ſo highly incens'd at the Treatment of
thoſe two Cities, which had deſerv'd ſo well of
the common Cauſe in the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, that they
would act no longer in Conjunction with them;
and upon their breaking with them, the Affairs
of <hi>Greece</hi> took a new and unexpected Turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> began now to think in
earneſt of enjoying ſome Repoſe themſelves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> incline to Peace.</note> and
of giving it to the leſſer States, whoſe Quarrels
had been promoted chiefly by them, and made
ſubſervient to their Views of obtaining the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of <hi>Greece.</hi> This was undoubtedly the
true Grounds of their Enmity, tho' ſeveral other
pretended Cauſes were aſign'd; of which the
moſt plauſible was, the ſettling the other Cities
and Republicks in a State of Freedom and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.
This was now in ſome meaſure ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
and the <hi>Spartans</hi> having been forc'd to
give up a great Part of the Power they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
obtain'd, the <hi>Athenians</hi> contented themſelves
with this Mark of their Submiſſion, eſpecially
ſince they had recover'd a great Part of what
they had loſt at Sea; which had brought things
to a pretty equal Balance. The Truth is, they
had been at almoſt all the Charge and Hazard of
the War, excluſive of their Allies; ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they had been ſucceſsful in the main,
they had been ſufficiently drain'd and haraſs'd,
and were therefore glad of ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>avourable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
to renew the former Treaty. There
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0761100600:143"/>
being at the ſame time nothing to apprehend on
the Side of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was deeply
engag'd in his <hi>Aegyptian</hi> War, there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Diſpoſition for Peace, and the Negotiations
were carried on ſucceſsfully by the <hi>Athenians;</hi>
but it was rejected by the <hi>Thebans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> aver ſe to it.</note> and in ſuch a
manner, as plainly ſhew'd they were now ſetting
up for themſelves, and would no longer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
as a ſubordinate State.</p>
               <p>They were naturally an hardy and robuſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but had the Character of being heavy and
ſtupid, even to a Proverb: And yet ſuch Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopides,</hi> and ſuch Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as <hi>Pindar</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> one would think,
ſhould have vindicated them from that Reproach.
However it is certain, they had not hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
themſelves in any Degree ſuitable to the
Fame of their Heroes and Founders, who by
their Exploits, partly Fabulous, and partly Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical,
had given a Promiſe of what might be
expected from their Deſcendants, eſpecially in a
City of ſo great Antiquity and Renown, as to
have maintain'd a Siege, even before that of
<hi>Troy.</hi> But they were far from anſwering theſe
Expectations. The <hi>Thebans</hi> were divided in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
from the <hi>Boeotians</hi> during the <hi>Perſian</hi> Wars;
which is aſſign'd as one Reaſon, why they were
ſo long kept under: They baſely deſerted the
common Cauſe of <hi>Greece</hi> at that Time, to join
with the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> And when, contrary to all
human Probability, that numerous Army was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0761100600:144"/>
defeated, they apprehended the Power and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who, as being their
Neighbours, might, under a Pretence of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Treachery, poſſeſs themſelves of their
Country. This Neceſſity threw them under the
Protection of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who choſe rather to
forgive the Friends of <hi>Perſia,</hi> than ſacrifice the
Enemies of <hi>Athens;</hi> and accordingly enter'd into
a League with them. The <hi>Thebans</hi> were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful;
they did them very great Service in the
<hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, and continu'd, during the
whole Courſe of it, their good and faithful
Allies. Upon what Occaſion they afterwards
broke with them, and were thereupon oblig'd
to have Recourſe to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> has already
been related. It was a conſtant Maxim with
them, as they were deſerted by one of thoſe two
States, to fall in with the other; and which Side
ſoever they inclin'd to, they were generally of
Weight enough to turn the Balance: However
they had hitherto made no further uſe of that
Weight, than to ſecure themſelves. But they
had been ſo conſtantly engag'd of late Years on
one Side or the other, according to the Exigencies
of their Affairs, that it had brought them into
Diſcipline, and fir'd their Ambition; and the
<hi>Spartans</hi> had principally contributed to it, by
their late ſrequent Expeditions againſt them. It
was an eſtabliſh'd Point of Policy in the <hi>Spartan</hi>
Government, to avoid engaging too often with
the ſame Enemy, for fear of inſtructing them in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0761100600:145"/>
the Art of War: And <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had, for the
ſame Reaſon, expreſly forbid it by his Laws.
But the Reſentment of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> againſt the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
carried him on beyond any Conſideration of
that kind; inſomuch that finding his Colleague
<hi>Cleombrotus</hi> averſe to the <hi>Theban</hi> War, he lead
the Army himſelf, notwithſtanding that he had
before claim'd the Privilege of his Age to excuſe
his Attendance: And an Action happening,
wherein he was wounded, <hi>Antalcidas</hi> reproach'd
him, <hi>That he was well requited by the</hi> Thebans,
<hi>for having taught them to fight.</hi> In ſhort, they
began now to look about them, and enlarge their
Views; and finding themſelves too much cramp'd
up within their ancient Limits, they laid hold of
the preſent Conjuncture, to extend their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
beginning, as the other States had done,
by little Encroachments on their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>The Spirit which now appear'd among them,<note place="margin">They are encourag'd by <hi>Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi>
                  </note> 
had been rais'd by <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> their late Deliverer
from the <hi>Spartan</hi> Yoke, and was ſeconded and
ſupported by <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who, tho' he had all the
Qualities neceſſary for the Service of the Publick,
yet choſe to lead a private Life, in a conſtant
Courſe of Virtue, and the Study of Philoſophy.
He had ſeldom appear'd in publick, but in order
to get himſelf excus'd from thoſe Employments,
which were ſo eagerly courted by others. But
his extraordinary Merit no longer ſuffering him
to enjoy his Retirement, he was forc'd out of it,
and plac'd at the Head of the <hi>Theban</hi> Army.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0761100600:146"/>
He had before this contracted an Intimacy with
<hi>Pelopidas,</hi> which was daily improv'd by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
of their Tempers and Principles, and
the ardent Zeal, which they both expreſs'd, for the
Good of their Country. And they had upon
ſome Occaſions before this Time appear'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Action: But <hi>Pelopidas</hi> having made a
more early Figure in the Army, the Succeſs,
which the <hi>Thebans</hi> had hitherto met with, was
generally aſcrib'd to him: However <hi>Epaminondas</hi>
had done enough to diſtinguiſh himſelf; and
they both now came to be conſider'd in the ſame
Light, as Generals abroad, and as Governors at
home.</p>
               <p>When the Treaty propos'd by the <hi>Athenians</hi>
was upon the Point of being executed, the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
demanded to be comprehended in it, under
the Name of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and to be expreſly
ſtiled ſo. But the other contracting Powers
would not agree to it: <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
upon their leaving <hi>Boeotia</hi> free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.
He was anſwer'd by <hi>Epaminondas,</hi>
who was there as Ambaſſador on the Part of
the <hi>Thebans, That they, the</hi> Spartans <hi>would do
well to ſhew them the Example, by ſetting free the
Country of</hi> Laconia; <hi>for that the Pretenſions of
the City of</hi> Thebes <hi>to the one, were as well founded,

Wherefore he left them in poſſeſſion of their

               <p>This Battle was fought within twenty Days

was the ſharpeſt of any that had happen'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Wars of the <hi>Grecians</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo it was more remarkable for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

four or five hundred kill'd on the Side of the
vanquiſh'd, even in the Height of the Rivalſhip
between <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> when they fought
with the moſt Rancour and Inveteracy. The
<hi>Thebans</hi> acquir'd more Glory by it, than any
of the Republicks had ever gain'd by any ſingle
Victory in thoſe Wars: And <hi>Epaminondas</hi> felt
ſuch a ſudden Exceſs of Joy upon it, that he
went out of his uſual Character, and was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to contain himſelf. But the next Day,
upon cooler Thoughts, he reſum'd the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0761100600:154"/>
and appear'd ſo penſive and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that his Friends were very inquiſitive to
know the Cauſe of it. He told them, <hi>He had
ſuffered himſelf to be too much tranſported upon
his Victory, and that he was now undergoing a
proper Chaſtiſement for it.</hi> But his Command
of himſelf upon this Occaſion, did not come up
to that of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> whoſe Behaviour after
the Battle, was ſo remarkably great, that I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether it can be parallel'd in the Hiſtory
of any Age, or Country.</p>
               <p>If happen'd, that when the News of the Defeat
came to <hi>Sparta,</hi> they were celebrating a Publick
Feſtival in the City, where there was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Strangers from ſeveral Parts of <hi>Greece.</hi>

The <hi>Ephori,</hi> who from the Accounts they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received of the Battle, could not but be
ſenſible of the terrible Conſequences of it, yet gave
Orders, that the Solemnity of the Day ſhould not
be interrupted; but privately ſending the Names
of the ſlain to each Family, out of which they
were loſt, they went on with the Sports and
Ceremonies, as if nothing had happen'd. The
next Morning, when they were more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the Particulars, the Fathers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the ſlain came out rejoicing in the
Market-place, and ſaluting each other with a
kind of Exultation: On the contrary, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of thoſe who ſurvived the Battle, conceal'd
themſelves in their Houſes; and if any of them
were, upon any neceſſary Occaſion, obliged to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0761100600:155"/>
go abroad, it was eaſily diſcover'd by their
Looks, that they were aſham'd to own their
Children. The Women carried it ſtill further,
the Mothers of the ſlain openly rejoicing, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
making Viſits to each other, and aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in a triumphant manner in the Temples;
whilſt they who expected their Children home,
ſat ſilent and dejected.</p>
               <p>But the Generality of the People were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd
by this Misfortune, and conſider'd it
as a Blow, that they ſhould never be able to
recover. They began to deſpair, when they
found themſelves without Troops, deſerted by
their Allies, and, in a manner, at the Mercy
of the Conqueror; eſpecially when they were
further informed, that he deſign'd to invade <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſus.</hi>
This occaſion'd a general Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and Repining: It brought to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the former Predictions of the Oracle,
<hi>That they ſhould ſuffer under a lame King.</hi> They
conſider'd further, that they had given the
Crown to this lame King, in prejudice to the
Right of <hi>Leotychidas</hi> his Nephew. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
theſe Reflections, and that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
been the ſole Author of their preſent
Calamity, he had ſtill ſo much Credit with
them, that they renew'd the Confidence they
they had formerly placed in him, and ſubmitted
their Affairs entirely to his Determination, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to Peace or War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0761100600:156"/>
One great Point under their immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
was concerning thoſe who had fled
out of the Battle. They were by the Law in
that cafe, to be degraded from all Honours,
and render'd infamous, inſomuch that it was a
Diſgrace to intermarry with them: They were
to appear publickly in mean and dirty Habits,
with patch'd and party-colour'd Garments, and
to go half-ſhav'd; and whoever met them in
the Streets, might inſult and beat them, and
they were not to make any Reſiſtance. This
was ſo ſevere a Law, and ſuch Numbers had
incurr'd the Penalties of it, many of whom
were of great Families and Intereſt, that they
apprehended the Execution of it might occaſion
ſome publick Commotions; beſides that theſe
Citizens, ſuch as they were, could very ill be
ſpared at this time, when they wanted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
the Army. Under this Difficulty, they
gave <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> a Power even over the Laws,
to diſpenſe with them, or to abrogate them,
or to enact ſuch new ones, as the preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
required. He would not aboliſh, or make
any Variation in the Law itſelf, but made a
publick Declarntion, That it ſhould lie dormant
for that ſingle Day, but revive and be in full
Force again on the morrow; and by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
he ſaved the Citizens from Infamy.</p>

               </p>

But this Project occaſion'd ſuch Factions and

not doubting but the <hi>Spartans</hi> would
come with a greater FoRce to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
did not think it adviſeable to purſue
his Victory without ſome further Aſſiſtance.
Accordingly he applied to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> but
they refus'd to join with him, concluding, as
they had done before, with regard to the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi>
that <hi>Sparta</hi> was low enough already, and
that it would be wrong Policy in them at this

Whereupon they murther'd Thirty of thoſe
who were principally concern'd, without any

by theſe Orators; inſomuch that there were

Skill in Military Affairs, got himſelf to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claR'd
General of <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> with which Authority
he had gain'd many of the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
into his Alliance; and the <hi>Thebans</hi> courted
him for his Aſſiſtance, when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
diſappointed of it at <hi>Athens.</hi> He appear'd
ready to join them with a good Body of Troops;
but when it came to the Point, he diverted them
from purſuing their Victory, adviſing them to
uſe it with Moderation, and not to make the
<hi>Spartans</hi> deſperate. The <hi>Spartans,</hi> on the other
hand, he perſuaded to lie by a little, till they
had recover'd Breath, and could fight upon more
advantageous Temrs: So that he acted rather as
a Mediator, than an Ally; and there is Mention
made of a Truce concluded between them by
his Means; but the Account of it is ſo differently
related, that it does not appear, whether it were
before, or after the Battle of <hi>Leuctra. Jaſon's</hi>
Buſineſs was to manage ſo between thoſe States,
that neither of them might grow too powerful,
and that he might make his Advantage of it in
bringing about his own Deſigns; which, by his
Mony, Art and Eloquence, he had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
effected. But notwithſtanding that he was
eager in the Purſuit of his Ambition, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to ſave Appearances, and to preſerve a
good Character; ſo that when he had injur'd or
moleſted any of his Neighbours, he would ſay,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0761100600:163"/>
by way of Excuſe, <hi>There is a Neceſſity for thoſe
to be unjuſt in ſmall Matters, who will act juſtly in

ten thouſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
Foot, without reckoning the light-arm'd
Soldiers: And with this Force, he might ſoon
have been capable of giving Law to the reſt of
<hi>Greece.</hi> But before he could make any Attempt
towards it, he was ſuddenly aſſaſſinated at the
Inſtigation of his Brothers <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>Polyphron,</hi>
who jointly ſucceeded him: But the latter kill'd
the other, and was ſoon after kill'd himſelf by
his<note n="*" place="bottom">Some make him his Brother.</note> Nephew <hi>Alexander,</hi> under the Pretence of
revenging the Death of his Father <hi>Polydore.</hi> By
this Means <hi>Alexander</hi> poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Pherae,</hi>
and became very oppreſſive and tyrannical. But

where he found the Inhabitants under the utmoſt

no Enemy had appear'd there in the Courſe
of near ſix hundred Years, ſince the <hi>Dorians,</hi> as
Deſcendants of <hi>Hercules,</hi> firſt got Poſſeſſion of
the Country. Hence it was, that <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, <hi>The
City of</hi> Sparta <hi>was like the</hi> Temple of the Furies,
<hi>which Nobody bad Courage enough to approach.</hi>
And it was a frequent Saying of <hi>Ageſilaus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
That the Women of</hi> Sparta <hi>had never ſeen the
Smoke of the Enemies Fire;</hi> which was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
upon him. There was another Saying of
<hi>Antalicidas</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe, who being in
Diſpute with an <hi>Athenian</hi> about the Valour of the
two nations, the <hi>Athenian</hi> bragg'd, <hi>That his

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0761100600:165"/>

that River, tho' it was then ſwell'd to an unuſual
Heighth, and tho' the <hi>Spartans</hi> taking that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to fall upon him, cut off a good Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Men. However he made good his
Paſſage, and march'd up to the Suburbs of the
City; where the Inhabitants were, with great
Difficulty, reſtrain'd from ruſhing out in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
and deſperate manner upon the Enemy.
But <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> upon this Occaſion ſhew'd more
Temper than ordinary; he found it neceſſary to
lay aſide his Pride and Obſtinacy, and to play a
ſaving Game. He endeavour'd to quiet the
Minds of the People, ſo as to keep them within
their Bounds, and made the beſt Diſpoſition he
could of them, for the Defence of the City.
It was thought proper in this Extrernity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
That as many of the <hi>Helots,</hi> as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lift,
and form themſelves into Companies, ſhould
receive their Freedom; and a thouſand of them
accepted the Offer; <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſays, ſix thouſand;
which is not very improbable from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

Body, they made ſo formidable an Appearance,
that the <hi>Spartans</hi> themſelves durſt not truſt them,
without placing a good Number of Mercenaries
and other Troops, as a Guard upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> being thus far advanc'd, made a

Author of all the Miſchief done to his Country.
But he reſolv'd not to be provok'd; he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
all theſe perſonal Inſults and Reflections,
as the Effects of Rage and Diſappointment, and
would not ſuffer himſelf to be diverted from the
only Point he had then in view, which was the
Security of the City; and the Preſervation of it

Enterprize, made it his Buſineſs, upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to accuſe and calumniate his Superiors.
Even after the Trial, he prevail'd ſo far, as to
get <hi>Epaminondas</hi> excluded for a Year from the
Government of <hi>Boeotia:</hi> But <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being more
a Favourite with the People, he went another
way to work, and endeavour'd to ſupplant him,
by ſetting up <hi>Charon</hi> againſt him; which he
contriv'd in the following manner. There was a
famous Painter of <hi>Cyzicus</hi> employ'd at <hi>Thebes</hi> in
drawing a Battle, but was forc'd away by the
Revolt there, before he had put the laſt Hand
to it. However the Picture remaining in the
City, <hi>Meneclides</hi> propos'd the hanging it up in
ſome publick Place, with an Inſcription to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
the Memory of a Victory obtain'd by
<hi>Charon</hi> at <hi>Plataea,</hi> tho' it was in reality no
more than a Skirmiſh, wherein forty <hi>Spartan;</hi>
were kill'd. This Action happen'd a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Battle of <hi>Leuctra;</hi> and the magnifying
it in this manner, was plainly with a Deſign to
eclipſe the Glory of that Day, and to throw a Slurupon 
the two Generals who commanded. <hi>Pele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas</hi>
therefore oppos'd the Motion; which yet
he did with great Art and Decency with regard
to <hi>Charon,</hi> to whom he gave all due Praiſe; but
at the ſame time he expos'd the Abſurdity of the
Propoſal, and the Malice and Impertinence of
the Author of it; which the People being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of, laid ſo heavy a Fine upon him, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0761100600:171"/>
he was not able to pay it; and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
he grew a common Diſturber of the
Government.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> they had unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
got rid of a very formidable Enemy:
But the Terror and Confuſion they had been in,
the Senſe of the Loſſes they had ſuſtain'd, and
their Apprehenſions of what further might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,<note place="margin">Cabals and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies in Sparta.</note> had created a great deal of ill Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and raiſed ſuch a Spirit of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
and caballing againſt the Government,
that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> found it almoſt as difficult a Task
to manage the People in the City, as to keep
the Enemy out of it.<note place="margin">The Means by which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſuppreſs'd them.</note> There was an Inſtance
of this kind, wherein he ſhew'd extraordinary
Addreſs, and Preſence of Mind. Two hundred
Malecontents had got into a ſtrong Part of the
Town, call'd <hi>Iſſorion,</hi> where they had ſeized
the Temple of <hi>Diana. Ageſilaus</hi> would not
employ Force againſt them, not knowing
how deep the Plot might be laid, and how
far it might ſpread; but went muffled up
in his Cloak, with only one Servant; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come near the Rebels, call'd out, and told
them, <hi>You have miſtaken my Orders; my Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not that you ſhould all go in a Body
to that Station, but ſome of you ſhould plant
yourſelves there, and others there;</hi> at the ſame
time pointing out to them different Parts of the
City. They went off accordingly, without the
leaſt Suſpicion, to the Places which he mark'd
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0761100600:172"/>
out to them; and immediately, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus diſpers'd, he order'd ſome of the
Troops to poſſeſs themſelves of that Poſt, and
cauſed about fifteen of the Conſpirators to be
apprehended; and they were put to death the
Night following. This Conſpiracy was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by another of more dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
wherein a great Number of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
were engaged, and had private Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
every Night, how to introduce a Change
in the Government. They were ſo ſtrong a
Party, that it was neither ſafe to proſecute them
publickly according to Law, nor to let them
go on, and connive at them. Wherefore <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi>
took another courſe, and, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> put them to death private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without Proceſs; which had never before been
practiſed in <hi>Sparta.</hi> But the preſent Exigency
of Affairs ſeem'd to make it neceſſary; for theſe
Seditions happen'd about the Time of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
Expedition. And to add to the Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the City was then under, many of the

was on the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to whom they

ſent <hi>Epaminodas</hi> again to them, with ſeven

<hi>Athenians</hi> being now in earneſt, ſent <hi>Chabrias</hi> to
oppoſe his Paſſage. He join'd the <hi>Spartans,</hi>
with their Allies, at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they made
up an Army of twenty thouſand Men; to which
there was afterwards an Addition of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

                  <hi>Epaminodas,</hi> by one Part of his Conduct in
this Expedition, incurr'd the Diſpleaſure of the

the Paſs, that was defended by the <hi>Spartans,</hi> he
was ſuſpected of Partiality towards them, for not
having purſu'd and ſlaughter'd them, when they
were judg'd to be in his Power. His Enemies
aggravating the Matter, and making it a Charge
of Treachery, got him turn'd out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and reduc'd to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a private Man. This Accuſation was not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0761100600:175"/>
thought to be well founded enough for ſo ſevere
a Cenſure: However an Occaſion offer'd ſoon
after, wherein his Service was ſo ſeaſonable, and
ſo important, that he eaſily wip'd off the Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>It
does not appear, what Effect the dividing
the Command between <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> had
upon this Invaſion; however it produc'd one
good Conſequence, as it ſerv'd to weaken the
Confederacy againſt them. For it was now made
uſe of as a Precedent by the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who were
grown ſo elated with their Succeſſes, and put ſuch
a Value upon their Services againſt <hi>Sparta,</hi> that
they diſdain'd to act any longer in Subordination
to the <hi>Thebans.</hi> This Spirit was rais'd in them
by <hi>Lycomedes</hi> of <hi>Mantinea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited up by <hi>Lycome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                  </note> who had been their
General in moſt of their late Expeditions. He
was of great Birth and Fortune, and being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
withal, repreſented to them, That the
whole Country of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> belong'd properly
to them, as the firſt ancient Inhabitants; That
they were the moſt numerous of any People in
<hi>Greece,</hi> and ſo ſtout and powerful, that they had
always been conſider'd in the firſt Rank of Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries;
inſomuch that the <hi>Spartans</hi> had never
done any thing againſt <hi>Athens</hi> without them, nor
had the <hi>Thebans</hi> now appear'd againſt <hi>Sparta,</hi> if
they had not ſupported them: That as they had
formerly advanc'd the Affairs of the <hi>Spartans,</hi>
they were now doing the ſame for the <hi>Thebans;</hi>
and that in ſhort, if they did not inſiſt upon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0761100600:176"/>
commanding in their Turn with them, they
might in the End find them <hi>Spartans</hi> too. He
had ſo inflam'd them with theſe Remonſtrances,
and gain'd ſuch an entire Credit with them, that
they eaſily agreed to every thing he propos'd;
and there was nothing ſo difficult that they were
not ready to undertake. This created a great
Coldneſs and Jealouſy on the Part of the <hi>Thebans:</hi>
And the <hi>Eleans</hi> at the ſame time were inclin'd
to break with the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> for refuſing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up to them ſome of their Towns, which
had been taken by the <hi>Spartans.</hi>

reſtoring <hi>Meſſene</hi> to the <hi>Spartans;</hi> which the
<hi>Thebans</hi> not agreeing to, the Negotiations broke
off; and <hi>Philiſcus</hi> of <hi>Abydus,</hi> who was employ'd

having left behind him two thouſand Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,

of the <hi>Spartans.</hi> At the ſame time they receiv'd

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0761100600:177"/>
put the Garriſon to the Sword; from whence he
proceeded to <hi>Parrhaſia,</hi> and deſtroy'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

upon their Return home, were intercepted by
the <hi>Meſſenians;</hi> and <hi>Archidamus</hi> coming up to

fell above ten thouſand of the Enemy, without
the Loſs of one ſingle Man on the Side of the
<hi>Spartans;</hi> and hence it was diſtinguiſh'd by the
Name of <hi>The Tearleſs Battle.</hi> The Joy upon the
Arrival of the News at <hi>Sparta</hi> was ſo great, that
the People were not able to contain themſelves.
This was the firſt remarkable Succeſs they had
met with ſince their Defeat at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> which

<hi>Alexander</hi> at firſt permitted every Body to ſee
him, with an Intent, by making him a publick
Spectacle, to break his Spirit, and humble him.
But it had a different Effect: He ſent to tell
him in Defiance, <hi>That it was abſurd in him, daily
to terment and put to Death ſo many innocent
worthy Citizens, and to ſpare him, who, he knew,
if ever he eſcaped out of his Hands, would certainly

The Tyrant, ſurpris'd at his Intrepidity, anſwer'd,

<hi>It is, that thou may'ſt periſh ſo much the ſooner,

From that time <hi>Alexander</hi> allow'd nobody to ſee
or diſcourſe with him but <hi>Thebe</hi> his Wife, whoſe
Curioſity was rais'd by the Account his Keepers
had given her of his Behaviour. Aſſoon as ſhe
was admitted to him, ſhe fell a weeping, and
ſaid, <hi>I pity your Wife. And I you,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>who can bear with</hi> Alexander, <hi>when you are not

rous'd in her ſuch a Senſe of her Husband's ill
Uſge of her, that ſhe repeated her Viſits to
<hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and complain'd freely to him of the
many Outrages ſhe had receiv'd. He was not
wanting, on his Part, to incenſe her ſtill more
againſt him, till by Degrees he had work'd her
up to the higheſt pitch of Hatred and Reſentment.
Theſe frequent Interviews had very much the

purſuing them, great Numbers of their Men

that the reſt of them were not totally defeated.
He was at this time in Diſgrace with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Reaſon whereof has before been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
and therefore he had no Command in this
Expedition, but ſerv'd as a common Soldier.
However when the Troops found themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe Difficulties, which they attributed to
the Incapacity of their Officers, they oblig'd
him to take upon him the Command. He took
the Horſe, and light-arm'd Foot, and poſting
himſelf in the Rear, repell'd and charg'd the
Enemy by turns, till he made good the Retreat.
The <hi>Thebans,</hi> upon the Return of the Generals,

<hi>Alexander</hi> was very much terrified at his

puſhing things to an Extremity, for fear of
making him deſperate, ſo as turn all his Fury

of the Juſtice and Integrity of the <hi>Thebans,</hi>
as well as of their Valour, that they were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
tempted to purſue their Deſign of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sovereignty of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> purſue their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Sovereigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Greece.</note> But finding
they could not compaſs it by their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
at home, they had recourſe to <hi>Perſia.</hi> And
they had now a good Pretence for it; for the
<hi>Spartans</hi> had before ſent one thither to treat
on their purt. Whereupon the <hi>Thebans</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it to their Confederates as expedient, that
each of them ſhould depute ſome proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to aſſiſt there likewiſe, in order to ſupport
their reſpective Intereſts. Accordingly the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians,
Eleans</hi> and <hi>Argives</hi> conſented to it;
and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was named on behalf of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans;</hi>
which the <hi>Athenians</hi> being inform'd of,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0761100600:183"/>
appointed Two on their part alſo. But this
was a Proof how much they were degenerated
from the Virtue of their Anceſtors: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
mean Applications had before been made
to the <hi>Perſians</hi> by particular Perſons or States,
there had been no Inſtance of a of a Congreſs of
this kind, where, by a general Conſent, all the
leading States of <hi>Greece</hi> were, by their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives,
aſſembled in Form, to diſcuſs and
ſettle their Demands on each other, at the
Court of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But this was the Caſe at
preſent; and the <hi>Spartans</hi> had chiefly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it by the Peace of <hi>Antalcidas,</hi> which
had prepared the <hi>Grecians</hi> in general to receive
the Yoke, and to govern themſelves according
to the Edicts of that King, whoſe Predeceſſors
had been ſo ſhamefully bafled in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts

by his Addreſs, and the Fame of his Exploits,
that he was particularly diſtinguiſh'd from the

He repreſented to him at his Audience,
That the <hi>Thebans</hi> had conſtantly, from the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Plataea</hi> to this preſent time, adhered to
the Crown of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and that the <hi>Spartans</hi> had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0761100600:184"/>
broke with them, purely becauſe they refuſed
to join with them againſt him. From thence
he took occaſion to mention their succeſs at
<hi>Leuctra,</hi> with their invading <hi>Laconia;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
that the late Overthrow of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi>
and <hi>Argives</hi> was owing to their not
having been aſſiſted by them. The King was
ſo well pleaſed with his Perſon and Diſcourſe,
and was ſo well affected to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> as the
People on whom he could beſt depend, that
he readily granted his Demands: The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
whereof was, <hi>That the Liberty formerly
granted to all the Towns, ſhould be confirmed;
That</hi> Meſſene <hi>in particular ſhould remain free
from the Juriſdiction of the</hi> Spartans; <hi>That the</hi>
Athenians <hi>ſhould lay up their Fleet;</hi> and <hi>that
the</hi> Thebans <hi>ſhould be look'd upon as the ancient
heredilary Friends and Allies of</hi> Perſia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pelopidas</hi> gain'd great Credit by this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation:
And the <hi>Thebans</hi> upon his return ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to receive the Benefit of it, caus'd the
Deputies of all the Towns to be aſſembled at
<hi>Thebes,</hi> in order to their ratifying the Treaty.
But when the Oath for confirming it was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to them, they ſaid, <hi>They came to hear
the Articles read, not to ſwear to them; which
they could not do without conſulting their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals.</hi>
And <hi>Lycomedes</hi> objected, in behalf of
the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> to the Place of their Meeting,
which, he ſaid, ought to be where the Seat
of the War was. This Method not taking
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0761100600:185"/>
effect, the Cities were applied to ſepartely,
in hopes by that means to awe them into a
Compliance. But the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaid plainly,
<hi>They did not ſee any Occaſion there was for the
Treaty;</hi> and others following their Example,
nothing further was done in it; ſo that the
<hi>Thebans</hi> were all at once diſappointed in their
Views; and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> left them as he found
them, without engaging himſelf any further in
their behalf; which indeed he could not do at
this time, without arming the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi>
againſt him. For his Partiality to the <hi>Thebans,</hi>
was now no leſs viſible, than the Deſigns of
the <hi>Thebans</hi> themſelves, who had rais'd ſo much
Jealouſy by what they had already done, that
there was a general Diſpoſition to unite againſt
them, and to make it a <hi>Common Cauſe.</hi> The
<hi>Athenians</hi> were particularly diſguſted by that
Article of the Treaty, which was to reſtrain
their Power at Sea; and they ſhew'd their
Reſentment by putting to death <hi>Timagoras</hi>
one of their Ambaſſadors, upon his Return
from <hi>Perſia.</hi> He was charged with having
taken part with <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and not having act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in concert with his Colleague: And as he
was next to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> in favour with the King,
and had received rich Preſents from him, it was
taken for granted, that he had betray'd the
Intereſts of his Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> would not yet give over their

have been ſwallow'd up, if they had not been

a Siege, and made a vigorous Defence, far
beyond what could have been expected from
a ſmall City, ſurrounded with ſo powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The chief Quarrel againſt them was
their ſteady Adherence to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> for
whoſe Sakes they had often been reduced to

never could be prevail'd upon, from their firſt

Work upon their Hands, in ſupporting this

               <p>The <hi>Athenians,</hi> upon this new Acceſſion, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

The Flame was firſt kindled between the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi>
and <hi>Eleans,</hi> who had long conteſted
their Right to <hi>Triphylia,</hi> which belong'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

claim a right of preſiding at the <hi>Olympick

to manage the Solemnity. The <hi>Eleans,</hi> to

Applauſe from the People, who were conven'd
from all parts of <hi>Greece</hi> to the Feſtival, and,
during this Action, ſtood as Spectators with
their Crowns on their Heads. The Behaviour
of the <hi>Eleans</hi> upon this Occaſion was the more
remarkable, becauſe they had a very low Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
for Arms, and had done nothing like
it before. However the <hi>Piſaeans</hi> remaining

               <p>Whilſt he was negotiating theſe Matters

at this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> altho' he was ſuppoſed to
be principally affected by it: For the <hi>Augurs</hi>
had made it portend his Death, conſidering
him as the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that was to be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
However he reſolv'd to go on, and march'd
out with only three hundred Horſemen, who
attended him as Voluntiers; and having join'd
the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> he encamp'd in the Face of the
Enemy, who was far ſuperior to him in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
having an Army of above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men.<note place="margin">The Battle at <hi>Cynos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalae.</hi>
                  </note> Near a Place call'd <hi>Cynos-cephalae,</hi>
there were two Hills oppoſite to each other
in the midſt of the Plain; and both Sides
endeavour'd to get poſſeſſion of them with their
Foot. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> at the ſame time order'd his
Cavalry to charge that of the Enemy, which
he ſoon routed, and purſued over the Plain.
But <hi>Alexander</hi> having gain'd the Hills, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Execution upon the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> who
attempted to force thoſe Aſcents, <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was
obliged to give over his Purſuit, and march
up to their Relief; which ſo animated them,
that, after two or three Charges, the Enemy
began to fall into Diſorder, and give way;
which <hi>Pelopidas</hi> perceiving, caſt his Eyes about
in ſearch of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and having at length
diſcover'd him in the right Wing, rallying and
encouraging his Men, he was ſo inflamed at
the Sight, that he advanced before his Soldiers,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0761100600:194"/>

retreated, and ſhelter'd himſelf in the Ranks.

through his Armour, and wounded him, and

However, to revenge his Death, they attack'd
the Enemy ſo vigorouſly, both with their
Horſe and Foot, that they intirely routed them,
and kill'd above three thouſand in the Purſuit:
And yet did they not look upon it as a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
or think that any Succeſs could compenſate
the Loſs of their General. The <hi>Thebans,</hi> who
were then preſent, lamented over him in the

him <hi>Their Father, Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Inſtructor in

<hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and other Allies not only ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiz'd,
but vy'd with them in expreſſing their
Concern, and doing Honour to his Memory:
And the whole Army was ſo affected, that
they neither put off their Armour, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
their Horſes, nor even dreſs'd their
Wounds; but ran to him, and heap'd up the

neither kindled a Fire, nor took any kind of
Refreſhment. In all the Cities through which
the Body paſs'd, it was attended by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
with the Prieſts and Inhabitants, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

After which the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> begg'd it as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Favour of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that they might
bury him, and, in the moſt pathetick Terms, urg'd
it as a ſort of Right due to them, as the greateſt
Sufferers. <hi>You indeed,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>have loſt a

with you: But we have likewiſe loſt in him all
the Hopes of recovering our Liberty; and under
this heavy Misfortune, our paying the laſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to him, may be ſome ſmall Alleviation of
our Sorrow.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi> granted their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and they buried him with great Pomp
and Splendor. His Death, as to the Manner
of it, was rather to be pitied than commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
For he certainly expos'd himſelf more than
he ought to have done. But beſides the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heat of his Temper, which was not eaſily
to be reſtrain'd, he was animated with a more
than ordinary Zeal in the Cauſe of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
eſpecially at this Juncture, when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Government. But notwithſtanding this Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0761100600:197"/>
and Appearance of Oeconomy, his conſtant
Attention to the Buſineſs of the Publick made
him neglect his private Affairs, and very much
impair'd his Eſtate; inſomuch that having a
great Number of Children to provide for, his
Friends took Occaſion one Day to tell him, <hi>That
Mony was a very neceſſary thing. It is ſo indeed,</hi>
ſaid he; <hi>but it is for that Man yonder,</hi> pointing
to one <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who was lame and blind.
There was a great Conformity of Manners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> except that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
moſt in the Exerciſes of the Body, and
the other in thoſe of the Mind. But they had
the ſame general Diſpoſition to Virtue, and the
Love of their Country; and this begat the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Friendſhip between them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> dates
the Beginning of it from the Siege of <hi>Mantinea,</hi>
ſoon after the <hi>Peace of Antalcidas.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi>
acting then in Alliance with <hi>Sparta, Epaminondas</hi>
and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> were engag'd together, and their
Wing giving way, they kept their Ground, and
ſtood ſingly in each others Defence, till <hi>Pelopidas</hi>
being very much wounded, fell among the Slain.
<hi>Epaminondas</hi> concluded him dead, yet would not
leave his Body in the Power of the Enemy, but,
tho' he was wounded himſelf likewiſe, maintain'd
the Conflict, till at length <hi>Ageſipolis</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi>
King came up from the other Wing of the
Army, and reſcu'd them both, when to all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
they were loſt. This was an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that muſt, in all Probability, have happen'd
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0761100600:198"/>
before the Town was beſieg'd; and there is room
to collect from <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> that it did ſo: But it
is not generally taken notice of, nor any where
particularly deſcrib'd; neither does it elſewhere
appear, that either of theſe two Generals had
diſtinguiſh'd themſelves ſo early in any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.
However this Circumſtance of their
Lives, in the manner it is atteſted, may
have its Weight, and it is too remarkable a
one to be omitted. But however their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
began, it was very ſincere and laſting; and
the Succeſs of their Atchievements was almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
owing to that perfect Union and good
Correſpondence, that was always between them,
without any Jealouſy of Command abroad, or
Rivalſhip in the Adminiſtration at home. This
good Agreement between them, has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, in oppoſition to that Spirit of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion,
Envy and Rancour, which formerly
reign'd in <hi>Athens</hi> between <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles,
Cimon</hi> and <hi>Pericles, Nicias</hi> and <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi>
who, great as they were in other reſpects,
were always endeavouring to ſupplant and ruin
one another; and their perſonal Enmity was
ſaid to exceed that which they bore to the
Enemies of their Country. But yet it has been
ſhewn, that ſome of them knew how to ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>le
their Jealouſies upon Occaſion, and to curb and
moderate their Reſentment, when the Affairs
of the Publick requir'd it. But there was no
need of any Management of this kind, between
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0761100600:199"/>
the two Great Men we are now ſpeaking of.
They had no private Views of their own;
they were above all Conſiderations of Mony;
and they had no Ambitions but for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
ſo that provided That were well ſerved,
their Intention was anſwer'd; and each of them
look'd upon the others Succeſs in it, as his own.
As to what relates further to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> ſingly,
he was very ſtrong and active, and of indeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
Induſtry; he was bold and enterpriſing,
and ſo ſucceſsful withal, that he never loſt one
Battle. He had ſo throughly eſtabliſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Favour and Affections of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he was choſe thirteen times Governor
of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> or (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſays) without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uption,
from the Time of the recovering the
<hi>Cadmêa.</hi> Upon the whole, he was at leaſt the
ſecond Man of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and in ſome reſpects
may be conſider'd as the Firſt, particularly
with regard to the Affair of the <hi>Cadmêa,</hi> which
was certainly the Foundation of the <hi>Theban</hi>
Greatneſs. He would indeed have perſuaded
<hi>Epaminondas</hi> to bear a part with him in that
Undertaking; but he declin'd it, as an Action
of too much Blood and Outrage. He told
him, <hi>That if the reſt who were concern'd in
it, were as moderate as their Chief, he ſhould
make no Scruple of joining with them; but
that ſome of them he foreſaw, would carry
their Paſſion and Revenge too far, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
involve the Innocent with the Guilty.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0761100600:200"/>
However, in the main he approv'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
as the Cauſe of Liberty, and in ſome
meaſure contributed towards the Succeſs, tho'
he did not care to be engaged in the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Part of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans,</hi> as well to revenge the Death
of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> as to improve the Victory of the
<hi>Theſſalians,</hi> which they were not able to do of

Inſtance recorded of him, wherein he diſcover'd
ſome little Sparks of Humanity and Remorſe,
which yet he was far from valuing himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For ſeeing a famous Tragoedian act in
the <hi>Troades</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> he went abruptly
out of the Theatre, but ſent to bid the Actor

was removed into another Quarter, to get in

and without ſtaying to refreſh themſelves, or

better,<note place="margin">Mantinea <hi>reliev'd by the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniens.</note> and took thoſe, who were without the

was a very ſharp one, but not deciſive; and
is to be conſider'd rather as a Skirmiſh, and
a Prelude to what happen'd afterwards, than
as a Victory. However it was of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Conſequence to the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> who,
without ſuch a ſeaſonable and miraculous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſ,

obliged to attempt ſomething further, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his own and his Country's Honour, and
to keep up the Spirits of thoſe, whom he had
taken under his Protection. And as the Time
allotted him for this Expedition was very near
expiring, he had no time to loſe. Beſides he
was got ſo far into the Enemies Country, and
they were ſo well prepared ſor him, and watch'd
his Motions ſo narrowly, that he thought he

or that if he did, it would be abandoning

determin'd him to proceed immediately

which was more by a third Part, both of Horſe
and Foot, than the <hi>Spartans</hi> had, with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and all the reſt of their Aſſociates. The
<hi>Mantineans,</hi> as the War was in their Territori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

were in the right Wing, with the <hi>Spartans</hi> next
to them; the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the leſt, and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaans,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0761100600:209"/>
Eleans,</hi> and others of leſs Note, made
up the main Body. The <hi>Thebans,</hi> with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians,</hi>
choſe the Left of their Army to oppoſe
the Right of the Enemy; the <hi>Argives</hi> were in
the right; and their main Body conſiſted of the
<hi>Euboeans, Locrians, Sicyonians, Meſſenians, Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians</hi>
and others: And both the Armies were
flank'd with their Horſe.</p>
               <p>But after this Diſpoſition, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> took a
Compaſs, as if he declin'd fighting; and then
made his Troops halt, and lay down their Arms,
with a ſhew of encamping at a ſmall Diſtance
from the Enemy, hoping, by this Feint, to allay
their Heat, and take off the firſt Impreſſion of
their Fury, and then to fall upon them by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe;
wich happen'd in a great meaſure as he
expected. For when he afterwards advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, they had quitted their Arms, and
their Horſes, and were ſo diſpers'd about, that
they had much ado to form themſelves in time.
However they recover'd the Surpriſe, and ſtood
the Charge with great Reſolution. <hi>Epaminondas</hi>
put the Iſſue of the Battle upon his left Wing, as
he did at <hi>Leuctra;</hi> and his Scheme of breaking
in upon the Enemy was much after the ſame
manner, by placing the beſt of his Men in Front,
then drawing them up cloſe, and narrowing them
to a Point, ſo as to penetrate like the Beak of a
Gally, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> expreſſes it. The Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began with the Horſe; and it was very hot
and obſtinate, till at length the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0761100600:210"/>
bore the Brunt of it, were ſo gall'd with the Darts
and Slings of the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and ſo over-power'd
with the Numbers of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that they were
forc'd to give Way, and to leave their Foot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
but yet they kept themſelves in a Body,
ſo as not to break in upon them. And in their
Retreat, meeting with a Detachment of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeans,</hi>
and other Mercenaries, whom <hi>Epaminondes</hi>
had ſent round to attack their Rear, they fell in
among them, and cut them entirely to pieces.
The reſt of the <hi>Athenians</hi> in that Wing, were
hard preſs'd by the <hi>Argives,</hi> and the <hi>Theben</hi>
Horſe; but ſome <hi>Elean</hi> Horſe, who had been
poſted in the Rear as a Body of Reſerve, coming
up to their Relief, they maintain'd their Ground.
Their Horſe in the other Wing made the ſame
vigorous Reſiſtance, but were forc'd at laſt to
throw themſelves in among their Foot for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>Upon
this the Foot join'd Battle, and ſought
with incredible Fury, eſpecially the <hi>Spartans</hi> and
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who were more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Event of the Action, and were
never more in Earneſt. Their Lances being
broke with the Violence of the Charge, they
clos'd in with their Swords, and ſtood Foot to
Foot, neither Side abating of their Rage, or
giving back one Inch of Ground. Which <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
perceiving, form'd a Troop of the moſt
determin'd Men about him, and putting himſelf
at the Head of them, made a very vigorous
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0761100600:211"/>
Charge upon the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Phalanx, and
wounded their General with the firſt Javelin he
threw. And his Troop puſhing on with the
ſame Ardour, he ſoon broke the Enemy to
pieces; and then made ſuch Havock among
them, that the Ground about him was cover'd
with the Bodies of the Slain. But advancing
ſtill forwards, in order to make a thorough Rout
of it, the <hi>Spartans</hi> rallied, and collected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a Body, pointing their whole Fury at
him, and throwing an infinite Number of Darts
at him,<note place="margin">Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas kill'd.</note> many of which he drew out of his Body,
and retorted at them; till at laſt he was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded by a Javelin, which was ſaid to
be thrown by <hi>Gryllus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who
was afterwards kill'd himſelf in the ſame Battle.
But the Death of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> is by ſome aſcrib'd

nor gain'd any Acceſſion of Territory, or any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Power, and that Things remain'd juſt in
the ſame Situation after the Battle, as they were
before. But however exact and faithful he may be
in the other Parts of his Hiſtory, he is thought
upon this Occaſion to have been a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd,
and to have induſtriouſly avoided ſaying
too much to the Advantage of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who
had manifeſtly the Victory, though they were in
too much Concern and Confuſion to purſue it;
and the only Grounds upon which the Enemy
diſputed it with them, was on account of the
<hi>Euboeans</hi> and others, whom the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in their
Retreat, had cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was carried alive into his Tent,
where, aſſoon as he recover'd his Speech, he ask'd
his Friends about him, <hi>Whether the Enemy had
taken his Shield from him:</hi> They told him, <hi>It
was ſafe;</hi> and it being brought to him, he kiſs'd
it. He then ask'd, <hi>Which Side had the Victory:</hi>
They told him, <hi>The</hi> Thebans. <hi>All then,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>is well.</hi> And ſoon after, upon the drawing the
Head of the Javelin out of his Body, he ſell, as
it were, in the Arms of Victory, and, congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mlating
the good Fortune of his Country, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
               <p>There
was ſomething very great and ſolemn in
theſe Circumſtances of his Death,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> and ſuitable to
that juſt and deliberate Firmneſs and Compoſure
of Mind, which he had ſhewn in all the Actions
of his Life. To conſider him in all Reſpects, as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0761100600:213"/>
a Soldier, Stateſman and Philoſopher, he was not
only, as <hi>Cicero</hi> eſteems him, the firſt Man of
<hi>Greece,</hi> but the greateſt perhaps that any Age or
Country has produc'd. For all the ſeveral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which others poſſeſ'd ſingly, were united
in him, and in ſo perfect a Degree, as to be
without an Allay of any one Vice, or Failing.
Beſides his natural good Diſpoſition, he had all
the Advantages of Education, and was furniſh'd
with the beſt Maſters, not only for Eloquence
and Philoſophy, but alſo for his Exerciſes, and
all the other lighter Accompliſhments. Hence
it was, that <hi>Polymnis</hi> his Father's Houſe was at
that time one of the beſt Schools in <hi>Greece,</hi> and
open to all the learned World. He was indeed
more liberal upon this Head of Expence, than
his Circumſtancees would allow; for tho' he was
of one of the beſt Families in <hi>Thebes,</hi> he died ſo
poor, as to leave his Son no other Fortune, than
what he had beſtow'd on him in this manner.
It happen'd however, that he neither wanted,
nor deſired one: For he had ſuch a thorough
Contempt of Riches, that he did not leave enough
to bury him. He was in this, as in many other
Reſpects, a Philoſoper in Practice and Reality,
and was poor upon Choice; and yet without any
Affectation, he View of being applauded for it.
<hi>Juſian</hi> ſays, he was no more deſirous of Fame,
than he was of Riches. He did not indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Popularity, or Applauſe; he was ſo modeſt,
that all his great Offices were in a manner forc'd
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0761100600:214"/>
upon him; and his firſt Motive in all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
was the Honour of his Country: But
yet he had not an Inſenſibility of Glory with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to himſelf, as may appear from the Anſwer
he made to his Friends about him when he was
dying. Among other Expreſſions of their Grief
for the Loſs of him, they lamented his leaving
no Children behind him: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I leave
two fair Daughters, the Victories of</hi> Leuctra <hi>and</hi>
Mantinea, <hi>to perpetuate my Memory.</hi> Upon
another Occaſion, being ask'd, <hi>Whether he thought
himſeif, or</hi> Chabrias, <hi>or</hi> Iphicrates, <hi>the better Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral?
'Tis hard,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to judge while we live.</hi>
There are other Inſtances to prove, that he knew
what was due to his Merit, and that he did not
decline Praiſe, tho' he did not covet it. He was
covetous of nothing but his Time, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
wholly in the Improvement of his Mind,
or in what he thought might be uſeful to the
Publick; and he made even his Diverſions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to that End. His Running, Wreſtling,
and other Exerciſes of that Kind, were not uſed
by him, as they generally were by others, barely
for Amuſement, or the Glory of excelling in
them, but as Leſſons of Inſtruction in the Art of
War. For which Reaſon he had an Averſion to
ſat Men in the Army, and disbanded one, <hi>who,</hi>
he ſaid, <hi>would require three or four Shields to cover
his Belly.</hi> He had an extraordinary Genius for
War, and had thoroughly ſtudied the Theory of
it, before he enter'd upon Action. It has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0761100600:215"/>
from his Diſpoſition, and his Manner of
attacking, both at <hi>Leuctra</hi> and <hi>Mantinea,</hi> that he
was particularly well skill'd in the <hi>Tacticks.</hi> That
which has ſet him in a Light above moſt of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Generals, is the Difficulties and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
which he met with upon his firſt
Appearance in the World. He had to do with
a People, who were ſunk into a State of Sloth
and Idleneſs, and diſpoſed to Slavery. They were
very low at that time in their Reputation for
Arms: And tho' they had taken ſome Part in
the late Wars, it was occaſionally only, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in order to ſupport themſelves by their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
to thoſe who were beſt able to protect
them, than with a Senſe of gaining Honour, or
aſſerting their Freedom. They had but few
Troops, and thoſe were without Spirit, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and without Officers to conduct them.
This was not the Caſe of the great Captains who
went before him, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> and
<hi>Sparta,</hi> who had Troops ready form'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd,
inur'd to Dangers and Fatigue, ſir'd
with Ambition, and the Love of their Country,
ſupported by their Fellow-Citizens, and fluſh'd
with Victory: So that their Commanders had
nothing more to do, than to purſue the Track of
Glory they were in, and to carry on the Service
in the Way they found it. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had
none of theſe Advantages: But by his Courage
and Zeal, and the Force of his Genius, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the want of them, and, in effect, created
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0761100600:216"/>
an Army; which being train'd up by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and animated by his Example, ſoon
ſhew'd the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that they were capable of
acting for themſelves, and fighting their own
Battles. From hence it was, that from Auxill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
and Dependents, they became Principals,
and put in for their Turn of Superiority in <hi>Grecce.</hi>
It muſt be allow'd, that <hi>Pelopidas</hi> had pav'd the
Way for him in effecting this Change, and that
he had been aſſiſting to him in moſt of his great
Enterprizes. But without <hi>Epimanondas,</hi> the Work
had been left very imperfect. It was his bold
Defiance of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> that brought on the
Battle of <hi>Leuctra:</hi> And he afterwards went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards the reducing them, than any one
Man, or than all the States of <hi>Greece</hi> together.
And tho' he did not throughly ſucceed in it,
he had ſo diſabled and diſpirited them, that they
never recover'd their former Reputation and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Among other Marks of their being
humbled, he had brought them to <hi>lengthen their
Monoſyllables,</hi> as he himſelf expreſs'd it, in rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

was viſible in every Circumſtance of his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0761100600:217"/>
Life: And nothing could ever ſhake his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
or ſlacken his Zeal ſor the Publick. The
<hi>Perſians</hi> knowing of what Conſequence it was to
fix him in their Intereſt, ſent <hi>Diomedon</hi> of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zicus</hi>
to tempt him with a large Sum of Mony.
He firſt gain'd <hi>Micythus,</hi> a particular Favourite
of his, and gave him five Talents to ſound him
upon it. But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> rejected the Offer with
Diſdain and Indignation, declaring, That he
would not put the Riches of the Univerſe in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with the Good of his Country. You, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon,
ſaid he,</hi> don't know me; and I am not
ſurprized, that you ſhould form a Judgment of me
from yourſelf; for which Reaſon I forgive you;
but withal adviſe you to make the beſt of your Way
home, that you may not have an Opportunity of
corrupting others. As for you, <hi>ſaid he, addreſſing
himſelf to</hi> Micythus, if you don't immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
him his Mony, I'll deliver you up to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy.
His Generoſity and Friendſhip have
ſufficiently appear'd in his Behaviour to <hi>Pelopidas.</hi>
He was judicious and grave, but yet afſable; he
was continent, patient of Injuries, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate;
and, to crown all, he was ſtrictly juſt,
and ſo ſincere a Lover of Truth, that he would
not tell a Lye even in Jeſt. He was alſo a very
able Speaker, and had gone further in his Search
after Knowledge of all Kinds, than moſt of the
Pailoſophers of his Time, who were ſo by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
And yet he did not value himſelf upon
it, or make any Shew of it; and it was ſaid of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0761100600:218"/>
him in this Reſpect, <hi>That Nobody knew more than
he, and ſpoke leſs.</hi> Study was indeed his darling
Paſſion; and he was ſo devoted to it, that he
may be conſider'd almoſt as a ſingle Inſtance of
one, who acquitted himſelf ſo well to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
againſt the natural Bent of his Inclination.
It was look'd upon as Matter of Aſtoniſhment,
that a Man who was ſo much hid from the World,
and buried, as it were, in Books, ſhould break out
at once into ſo great, and ſo tumultuous a Scene
of Action; that he ſhould negotiate the Intereſts
of his Country abroad, manage the Government
at home, and lead an Army with ſuch Succeſs
againſt the united Powers of <hi>Greece.</hi> But he had
a Capacity for every thing, and applied himſelf
to every thing; and when he was once rouſed
by a Senſe of what the Publick expected from
him, he gave up his belov'd Retirement, and
was from thenceforwards in ſuch continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Nobody every did ſo much in ſo ſhort
a Time. When the <hi>Thebans</hi> were once brought
into Action, he reſolv'd to keep them up to it:
If I am your General, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you muſt be Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
<hi>Boeotia,</hi> as being an open flat Country, <hi>he
told them,</hi> was the Stage of War; and that they
could keep it no longer than they had their Hands
<hi>upon their Shields.</hi> It was by theſe Maxims, and
this Conduct, that he became the Support of his
Country, and a Pattern to the greateſt Captains
of the preſent, and ſucceeding Times. <hi>Philopae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who is call'd the laſt of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> made
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0761100600:219"/>
it his Study to imitate him; and is ſaid to have
come very little ſhort of him in his Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and his Integrity. But he was more rough
and cholerick, and had too much of the Soldier
in his common Deportment; whereas <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi>
was cool and gentle, and had nothing of
Fierceneſs, but in the Field. Upon the whole,
he rais'd the Glory of <hi>Thebes</hi> to an Heighth
beyond any of her Neighbours at that Time,
and that ſo ſuddenly, that it was ſaid to be born
with him: And it will appear by the Sequel of
the Story, how far it may be likewiſe ſaid to
have expir'd with him.</p>

as ſoon as it was kindled. However They
did not preſently give up their Pretenſions;
They were ſtill rank'd among the Leading

they were faint and ineffectual, and ſuch as
were rather for Life and Being, than for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
and Dominion. They propoſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further to themſelves at preſent, than an
honourable Peace; and this was according to
the Opinion of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> himſelf, who, when
he lay wounded in his Tent, inquir'd after
thoſe whom he judged moſt proper to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him in the Command; and finding they

                  </note> who was therefore look'd upon as

was the laſt Scene of his Life, was ſtill more
blameable, at leaſt with regard to himſelf, tho'
it did not ſo much affect the Intereſt of his

of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> being at War with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
engaged <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to aſſiſt him with a

that Service, expecting to have the ſole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Army. Upon his Arrival in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> all the great Officers of the Crown
went to pay their Compliments to him; and
the whole Country flock'd down to the Shore
to ſee the Man, whoſe Reputation in Arms
had made ſo much Noiſe in the World. But
they were much diſappointed, when, inſtead of
the great and awful Prince they look'd for,
they found a little old Man of a contemptible
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0761100600:223"/>
Preſence, lying on the Graſs, his Cloaths thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare,
and his Hair uncomb'd, and rejecting
their rich Preſents of Sweetmeats and Perfumes,
which he told them, they might give to his Slaves
the <hi>Helots.</hi> He join'd the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Army,
which conſiſted of eighty thouſand Men, beſides
ten thouſand hired Troops, whereof one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
were <hi>Spartans.</hi> But <hi>Tachos</hi> deceiv'd him
in his Expectations of being General, and would
allow him no other Command than that
of the <hi>Mercenaries</hi> at Land, committing to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brias,</hi>
who came in as a Voluntier from <hi>Athens,</hi>
the Charge of his Fleet, and reſerving to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the chief Command over all. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was
otherwiſe treated by him with ſo much Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and in a manner ſo much below his
Spirit and Dignity, that he took an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to fall in with <hi>Nectanebus</hi> his Son, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Nephew, who had revolted from him,
and got himſelf to be proclaim'd King in his
ſtead. And the People being generally on his
Side, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> join'd with them, and drove <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos</hi>
out of his Kingdom. He had no ſooner
withdrawn himſelf, but another Competitor
ſtarted up, and march'd againſt <hi>Nectanebus</hi> with
an Army of an hundred thouſand Men, who
ſhut him up in one of his Towns, and laid
Siege to it. When the Works were pretty
well advanc'd, and the Lines of Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
drawn almoſt round the Place, <hi>Nectanebus</hi>
threw himſelf among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0761100600:224"/>
out by Night at the Gap where the Lines
were unfiniſhed, drew up his Forces, and eaſily
routed thoſe of the Enemy, who were entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and encompaſſed by their own Works.
This was owing intirely to the Advice and
Conduct of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who improved this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
by ſeveral others, 'till he had ſettled
<hi>Nectanebus</hi> in full and quiet Poſſeſſion of the
Throne. <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates this Part differently,
as if <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> had reconcil'd himſelf to <hi>Tachos,</hi>
and reinſtated him in the Kingdom. But this
reſts ſingly upon his Authority; and the other
Account is more natural, as well as more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
<hi>Ageſilaus</hi> acquitted himſelf extremely well
as to the military Part of this Expedition; but
it does not in other Reſpects redound much
to his Honour. One chief Motive of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
it, was Gain; which he cover'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of ſupplying the Neceſſities of
the State. But the letting himſelf out to hire
to a Barbarian, and ſerving under an <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Rebel, as a Captain only of a Band of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries,</hi>
was thought very unbecoming a <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
King, eſpecially of his Age and Character.
He firſt made a mean Figure by entering into
that Service, and then a ſcandalous one by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
it, and joining with the Enemy of him,
whom he came to as an Auxiliary. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to juſtify himſelf by ſeveral falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
and, according to the common Plea of
the <hi>Spartans</hi> in the like Caſes, call'd it Acting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0761100600:225"/>
for the Benefit of his Country. But whatever
Name he gave it, it was certainly a foul Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls it downright Treachery.
And it was more ſo in him, becauſe it was
purely his own Act, without being tied down
by any expreſs Orders from the Government
of <hi>Sparta.</hi> The Winter following <hi>Nectanebus</hi>
diſmiſs'd him, with great Marks of Civility
and Gratitude for the Services he had done
him, and gave him two hundred and thirty
Talents of Silver, with which he ſail'd home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but was drove by Streſs of Weather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a deſart Shore of <hi>Africa,</hi> call'd <hi>The Haven
of Menelaus;</hi> where he ſicken'd and died,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> being
full eighty four Years old, of which he had
reigned forty one.</p>
               <p>He was ſo extraordinary a Man,<note place="margin">and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> and had ſo
many mixt Qualities, that beſides what has
been already obſerv'd of him in the courſe of
the Hiſtory, it may be proper to take a more
diſtinct View of him. He ſet out in the World
with ſtrong Prejudices againſt him, both as to
his Perſon and his Pretenſions. The firſt of
them he overcame by the Sprightlineſs of his
Air, and his Good-humour, with a way he
had of jeſting upon himſelf, which prevented
others uſing the ſame Freedom with him.
However he was ſo ſenſible of his Defects, that
he would not ſuffer any Picture or Statue to be
made of him in his Life-time, and utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>id
the doing it after his Death. His Way
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0761100600:226"/>
to the Throne was attended with greater Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
which yet he got over by his Spirit
and Addreſs, and by the Aſſiſtance of his
Friends, particularly of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who in effect
put the Crown upon his Head. And in that
reſpect, it was made a Charge of Ingratitude
upon <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> that he had afterwards upon a
ſlight Pretence thrown him off. But he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was the Cauſe of it; he valued himſelf too
much upon his Services to him; and his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to him in <hi>Aſia</hi> has been ſhewn to be
ſo arrogant and aſſuming, that it might very
well juſtify his ſending him away from him,
when he found he could no longer act with
him. <hi>Lyſander,</hi> full of Reſentment, upon his
Return form'd a powerful Party againſt him;
to break which, he ſingled out the Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſome of whom he ſent away upon foreign
Services; others he got to be accuſed of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
and Injuſtice in their Employments; and
then made it his Buſineſs to bring them off,
thereby obliging them to become his Friends;
and ſo by degrees he wore out the Faction.
As he was a younger Son, he was bred up with
more Severity and Subjection, than the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Heirs of the Crown; and by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
he paid to the Laws as a private Man,
he was better fitted for the Government, when
he came to it. He made great court to the
<hi>Ephori,</hi> and the Senate, even to a Shew of
Reverence, and by the Deference he paid to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0761100600:227"/>
their Power, he ſecretly advanc'd his own, and
by that Means carried the Prerogative higher
than any of his Predeceſſors. But his Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
grew at laſt ſuſpected; inſomuch that he is
ſaid to have been fined by the <hi>Ephori</hi> for <hi>mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizing</hi>
the Citizens, who were look'd upon as the
common Goods of the Republick. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for his Continency and Moderation;
and kept up the old <hi>Spartan</hi> Plainneſs and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
even to Affectation, not allowing his Wife
and Daghter to diſtinguiſh themſelves by their
Dreſs, and living in the ſame Houſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> his Predeceſſor above ſeven
hundred Years before, nor ſuffering ſo much as
the Door of it to be repair'd. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this rigid Appearance, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Stiffneſs or Moroſeneſs in his Behaviour;
he treated every Body with Candour and Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and had ſuch a Complacency and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
in his Converſation, as made him ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the laſt. He was very ſond of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and would often enter into their little Sports
with them. Being one Day ſurpriz'd by a Friend,
as he was riding with them on an Hobby-horſe,
<hi>Say nothing of it,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>till you are a Father
yourſelf.</hi> He was generous to his Enemies, not
detracting any thing from their due Merit, eaſily
forgiving, and never taking any unjuſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
againſt them. On the other hand he was
too partial to his Friends, whom, in all Caſes,
right or wrong, he thought himſelf oblig'd to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0761100600:228"/>
ſupport: Of which there is an Inſtance in a
Letter of his to <hi>Idrieus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Caria,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſays, <hi>If</hi> Nicias <hi>be innocent, acquit him; if
he be guilty, acquit him upon my account; however
be ſure to acquit him.</hi> Of the ſame Kind was his
interpoſing in Behalf of <hi>Phaebidas</hi> and <hi>Sphodrias;</hi>
and yet the Conſequence of it was, in a great
meaſure, the engaging <hi>Sparta</hi> in the <hi>Leuctrian</hi>
War. It was a Saying of his, <hi>That to be ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
in Point of Juſtice when one's Friend is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
is only a Pretence for deſerting him.</hi> Yet
Nobody talk'd more of Juſtice upon other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
than he did; inſomuch that ſome about
him expatiating one Day upon the Grandeur of
the King of <hi>Perſia, Wherein,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ageſilaus, does
his Grandeur conſiſt? Or how is he greater than I
am, if he be not more juſt?</hi> By which he would
have it underſtood, that Juſtice was the Rule of
all his Actions. But he has not given many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of it, eſpecially in his publick Character;
wherein he was ſo different from what he was
in his private Life, that he may be conſider'd
as two different Perſons. His Failings in the
latter were few, and, generally ſpeaking, good-natur'd
ones; but in his Regal and Military
Capacity, his Paſſions were much ſtronger, and
his Faults more unpardonable. The ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
Temper which he diſcover'd from his
Childhood, and by which he afterwards uſurp'd
the Crown, carried him on to the laſt Stage of
his Life, and bore down all other Conſiderations,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0761100600:229"/>
that ſtood in the Way of his Ambition. And
yet he manag'd ſo well, that he paſs'd the firſt
thirty Years of his Reign in great Honour and
Eſteem: But as he advanc'd further in Years,
he grew more perverſe and arbitrary, and withal
more reſtleſs and impatient, continually forming
new Schemes of Action, and never eaſy but in
War; and indeed he had admirable Talents for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. He was brave, active and vigilant; he had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nur'd himſelf to the Extremes of Heat and Cold,
and far'd as hard, in other Reſpects, as a private
Centinel. He was very careful to keep up the
Courage of his Soldiers; for which Purpoſe he
would conceal, or leſſen the News of a Defeat
in other Parts, or ſometimes ſubſtitute the Report
of a Victory in the room of it. He had a more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efin'd way of deceiving his Enemies, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
his real Deſign of a March or an Attack,
ſo that they might take it for a Feint, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
be unprepar'd for him. Nobody knew
better how to uſe the Advantages of Time and
Place, or to effect by Stratagem, what he could
not obtain by Force. And notwithſtanding his
natural Impetuoſity, he could command himſelf
upon Occaſion, and was either cool and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rate,
or daring and deſperate, according as the
Caſe requir'd; of which he gave ſufficient Proofs
in his Defence of the City of <hi>Sparta.</hi> His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
upon that Occaſion, when the Whole
was at Stake, was great and glorious; tho' it
muſt be allow'd at the ſame time, that he did
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0761100600:230"/>
nothing more than what he ow'd to his Country
whoſe Intereſts he had ſacrificed to his implacable
Hatred of the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> and his
inſatiable Thirſt of Revenge. The <hi>Spartans</hi> were
ſo ſenſible of his Abilities, that when he was in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> they conſtituted him Admiral as well as
General, which was an Honour they had never
before conferr'd on one ſingle Perſon. His
Power after that Expedition encreaſing in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Opinion they had of him, he did
what he would with them, and brought them
into ſuch a Condition, that they were forc'd to
rely upon him, and to ſtand or fall with him.
And tho' he ſav'd them from immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
he had ſufficiently drain'd and haraſs'd
them, and left them in a miſerable declining
State. <hi>Lyſander</hi> gave the firſt Shock to their
Power by his Pride, and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> quite broke
it by his Obſtinacy; the firſt made them odious
to their Neighbours, and the latter made them
contemptible. And upon the Whole, it may be
ſaid, that <hi>Sparta</hi> ow'd her Downfal to the two
greateſt Men ſhe ever bred.</p>
               <p>The Death of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and the Peace
which enſu'd upon it, had ſlacken'd the Zeal of
the principal Powers of <hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent State of</hi> Greece.</note> and render'd 'em
too ſecure. The <hi>Athenians</hi> more particularly,
when they found themſelves deliver'd from him
who kept up their Emulation, grew indolent
and remiſs, and abandon'd themſelves to their
Eaſe and Pleaſure, being wholly taken up with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0761100600:231"/>
Shews, Sports and Feſtivals. They were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
too much addicted to theſe Sorts of Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and they had formerly been encourag'd in
them by <hi>Pericles,</hi> who knew how to lead them
by their Inclinations, and took this Method to
ingratiate himſelf with them, and to divert them
from inſpecting too narrowly into his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
But they now carried theſe Diverſions
to a much higher Pitch of Extravagance. They
had ſuch a Paſſion for the Stage, that it ſtifled
in them all other Thoughts, either of Buſineſs, or
of Glory. Poets and Players were become their
only Favourites, and receiv'd the Eſteem and
Applauſe, that was due to the Captains who
had fought their Battles. The very victualling
of their Fleets and Armies was conſum'd upon
the Stage. Their Singers and Dancers were
pamper'd up with Marrow and other luſcious
Food, whilſt the Admiral and the Captains of
the Ships had no other Proviſions on board, but
Meal, Cheeſe and Onions. In ſhort, the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and other Charges attending the Theatre,
were ſo exceſſive, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, <hi>It coſt more
to repreſent ſome of the famous Pieces of</hi> Sophocles
<hi>and</hi> Euripides, <hi>than it had done to carry on the
War againſt the Barbarians.</hi> And in order to
ſupport this Charge, they ſeiz'd upon the Fund
which had been ſet apart for the War, with a
Prohibition, upon Pain of Death, even to adviſe
the applying it to any other Purpoſe. They
not only revers'd this Decree, but went as far
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0761100600:232"/>
the other way, making it death to propoſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Remains of that Spirit and Vigour, which they
had exerted in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Wars, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd

to him.</p>
               <p>But whilſt they were wrapt up in this ſlothful
Security, and had nothing immediately to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
from their old Enemies, either in <hi>Greece</hi>
or <hi>Perſia,</hi> they found themſelves on a ſudden
engag'd with a People,<note place="margin">

                  </note> who were hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
and in a manner barbarous. Theſe were
the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> who, tho' they were hardy,
and warlike enough, had never yet preſum'd to
intermeddle in the Affairs of <hi>Greece.</hi> The Truth
is, they had enough to do at home, to adjuſt the
Quarrels about the Succeſſion of their Kings, and
to defend themſelves againſt the <hi>Illyrians, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and other powerful Neighbours. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Circumſtances concur'd at this Time to raiſe
them out of their Obſcurity, and to bring them
into a new Scene of Action; which by Degrees
wrought ſuch a thorough Change in the State of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0761100600:233"/>
                  <hi>Greece,</hi> that it will be neceſſary to take a curſory
View of their Affairs, and to conſider them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectedly
with thoſe of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> at leaſt ſo
far as may ſerve to ſhew, by what Steps this
Change was effected.</p>
               <p>They may alſo upon another Account ſeem to
require a Place in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Story;<note place="margin">How far they may be conſider'd as Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> for their
firſt Kings were of <hi>Grecian</hi> Extraction. But they
are not ſo much entitled to it from their Deſcent,
as from their Exploits, by which the very Name
of <hi>Greece</hi> was in a great meaſure loſt, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
up in that of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Before their
later Atchievements, which brought about this
great Revolution, they were no otherwiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as a Part of <hi>Greece,</hi> than many other Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
who were originally planted from thence,
but having afterwards little or no Intercourſe with
their Mother-Country, contracted the Habits and
Manners of the Natives where they ſettled, and
from thence were look'd upon as one and the
ſame People with them, and in the ſame Degree
of Barbariſm. This was the Caſe of moſt of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Colonies: And therefore, tho' I have had
frequent occaſion to mention them, I have not
enter'd further into their Story, than as it has
born relation to <hi>Greece,</hi> either on account of their
Wars or Alliances with it, or of their being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by it, or becoming tributary to it, or of
ſuch other Engagements and Dependences, as
have blended their Affairs with thoſe of the <hi>Gre
cians,</hi> and made the Relation of them a neceſſary
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0761100600:234"/>
Part of their Hiſtory. Thus much may ſuffice
to account for my not having treated the moſt
remarkable of theſe Colonies ſo fully and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as might be expected from the Figure they
have made in the World; ſuch as <hi>Sicily, Crete,</hi>
and ſome others of the Iſlands, with the <hi>Leſſer
Aſia,</hi> and ſeveral other Parts of the Continent.
But it ought to be conſider'd, that where their
Fame and Grandeur has been owing more to
their Tranſactions with other People, than with
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> moſt of the Particulars concerning
them do not fall within the Compaſs of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
but belong more properly to a ſeparate
Hiſtory of their own, or to that of the Nation,
which they have had moſt to do with.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> were ſo call'd before the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
intermix'd with them:<note place="margin">Their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</note> And they were ſome
time known by other Names, which they receiv'd
from the firſt Planters, or principal Men either
of the whole Country, or of ſome particular
Parts of it. But the Accounts we have of theſe
original Founders, like thoſe of the <hi>Grecian</hi> States,
are very fabulous and imperfect. The firſt who
is mention'd, with any Degree of Certainty, to
have reign'd in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> was <hi>Caranus,</hi> by Birth
an <hi>Argive,</hi> and ſaid to be the ſixteenth in Deſcent
from <hi>Hercules.</hi> It was upon this Foundation,
that <hi>Philip</hi> grounded his Pretenſions to be of the
Race of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and aſſum'd to himſelf Divine
Honours; wherein he carried his Vanity a great
way, tho' not ſo far as his Son did after him.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0761100600:235"/>
                  <hi>Caranus</hi> therefore is commonly reputed to have
led forth a Body of his Countrymen,<note place="margin">Their firſt Kings.</note> by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Oracle, into theſe Parts, where he
ſettled, and made himſelf King. And yet <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi>
contrary to the Opinion of all the later
Writers, makes <hi>Perdiccas</hi> the firſt King. <hi>Sir
Iſaac Newton</hi> reconciles this Difference by a very
probable Conjecture, that they were Joint-Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of this Kingdom; that they were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary,
and of the Royal Family of <hi>Argos,</hi>
from whence they fled about the ſame Time, and
at firſt erected ſmall Principalities in <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
which, after the Death of <hi>Caranus,</hi> became one
under <hi>Perdiccas:</hi> and that this Kingdom was
founded about the 46th or 47th <hi>Olympiad.</hi> From
this Time the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were properly a <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Colony; and, among other Proofs of their
being ſo, it is obſervable, that <hi>Amyntas,</hi> which
was the Name of ſome of their ſucceeding Kings,
was alſo a common Name among the <hi>Argives.</hi>
Another of their Kings was, by virtue of their
<hi>Grecian</hi> Extraction, admitted to the <hi>Olympick</hi>
Games. But whatever Rights and Privileges this
Nation claim'd as <hi>Grecians,</hi> they were generally
treated as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> till ſuch time as they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
their Arms into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and had trampled upon
the Liberties of <hi>Greece. Caranus</hi> having, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the general Account, reign'd twenty-eight
Years, the Succeſſion was continu'd after him to
the Times we are now treating of. But there is
very little worth Notice recorded of theſe Kings,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0761100600:236"/>
they being chiefly employ'd in defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the Incurſions of their Neighbours:
And as to their domeſtick Affairs, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
only for the frequent Murthers and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations,
which happen'd in the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amynlas</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Amyntas Father of Philip.</note> who was the Sixteenth in
Deſcent from <hi>Caranus,</hi> and the Father of that
<hi>Philip</hi> whom we are now to treat of, had much
ado to ſupport himſelf in the Throne; he left
it in a very tottering Condition, and entail'd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

War with the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Olynthians</hi> upon his
Children. By his Wife <hi>Eurydice</hi> he left three
Sons, who all in their turn ſucceeded to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Alexander, Perdiccas</hi> and <hi>Philip;</hi> he had
alſo a natural Son, call'd <hi>Ptolemy Alorites.</hi> Some
ſay, he had a ſecond Wife, call'd <hi>Gygaea,</hi> and by
her had three more Sons, <hi>Archelaus, Argaeus</hi> or
<hi>Archideus,</hi> and <hi>Menelaus,</hi> who were murder'd by
<hi>Philip.</hi> But this does not ſeem probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Eurydice</hi> appears to have ſurviv'd <hi>Amyntas,</hi>
and to have been very active in the ſucceeding
Reigns. The Succeſſion of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi>
was ſtrongly oppos'd; firſt by <hi>Pauſanias,</hi>
whoſe Father and himſelf had before uſurp'd the
Crown, and then by their Brother <hi>Plolemy,</hi> who
is ſaid to have murder'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to have
reign'd three Years upon his Death, till he was
afterwards ſlain himſelf by <hi>Perdiccas. Pauſanias</hi>
was drove out by <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> who at this Time
happen'd to be ſent by the <hi>Athenians</hi> with a ſmall
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0761100600:237"/>
Fleet into thoſe Parts, to make the neceſſary
Diſpoſitions for the Siege of <hi>Amphipolis. Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi>
upon this Occaſion, accoſted him in a very
moving manner: She brought her two Sons <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi>
and <hi>Philip</hi> to him, and putting one of 'em
between his Arms, and the other upon his Knee,
conjur'd him, by the mutual Friendſhip that had
paſs'd between the two Nations, and by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Kindneſs and Affection that her Husband
had born to him, that he would take theſe two
Orphans into his Protection, and defend them
againſt the Invader. But this Account of her
Maternal Affection is by no means conſiſtent with
that which <hi>Juſtin</hi> gives of her, That being in
love with her Son-in-law, who is underſtood to
be <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> ſhe caus'd her own two Sons <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and <hi>Perdiccas</hi> to be murder'd, in order to

before attempted to deſtroy her Husband with
the ſame View. But the Hiſtory of theſe two
Kings, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> is ſo confus'd,
that not only the Tranſactions of one Reign ſeem
to be aſcrib'd to another, but the Tranſactions
themſelves are alſo differently related. As to
<hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the moſt plauſible Account given of him,
is, that upon his Competition with <hi>Perdiccas,</hi>
they referr'd themſelves to <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
the Crown to the latter, the other quitted
his Pretenſions: And <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> for the better
Obſervance of this Agreement, carried <hi>Philip</hi>
with him, among others, as Hoſtage to <hi>Thebes.</hi>

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0761100600:238"/>
There are other Occaſions mention'd of his being
given as an Hoſtage to the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> both by his
Father, and his Brother <hi>Alexander.</hi> However
that be, it is certain he was at <hi>Thebes</hi> at the Time
of the Death of his Brother <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the moſt general Accounts, was kill'd
in a Battle with the <hi>Illyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Accident brought him home,<note place="margin">The Riſe of Philip.</note> and gave
him an Opportunity of exerting thoſe Talents,
by which he not only ſurpaſs'd all his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
but eclips'd the Fame of all the <hi>Grecians</hi>
of his Time; tho' it muſt be confeſs'd, that he
receiv'd his firſt Impreſſions of Glory from 'em,
and that he ow'd a great deal to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he made under <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> But beſides
theſe Advantages, he had great natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a Genius equal to the greateſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
as may ſuſſiciently appear from the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
he had to encounter at his firſt ſetting out,
when he was ſcarce three and twenty Years old, and
the Means he us'd to overcome them. <hi>Perdiccas</hi>
had left a young Son to ſucceed him; ſo that
<hi>Philip</hi> had no immediate Proſpect of coming to
the Crown. However, upon the News of his
Brother's Death, he ſtole home privately from
<hi>Thebes,</hi> and taking Advantage of the Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

they apprehended from an Inſant-Reign,<note place="margin">A M. 3645. Olymp. 105. 1. <hi>He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the preſent Condition of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> requir'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0761100600:239"/>
a Man of his Prudence and Activity: For they
were ſurrounded with as many Enemies, as they
had Neighbours. The <hi>Illyrians</hi> fluſh'd with their
late Victory, were preparing to march againſt
them with a ſtrong Army; the <hi>Paeonians</hi> were
making daily Incurſions upon them; and at the
ſame Time the Title to the Crown was conteſted
by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and <hi>Argaeus,</hi> the former whereof
was ſupported by the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and the latter
by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who for that Purpoſe had ſent
out a good Fleet, and three thouſand Land
Men.</p>
               <p>Under theſe Circumſtaces, with ſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
on his Hands at once, and that before
he was ſettled in the Throne, his firſt Part was,
to make ſure of his own People, to gain
their Affections, and to raiſe their Spirits; for they
were very much diſhearten'd, having loſt above
four thouſand Men in the late Action with the
<hi>Illyrians.</hi> He ſucceeded in theſe Points by the
Artfulneſs of his Addreſs, and the Force of his
Eloquence, of which he was a great Maſter.
His next Step was to train and exerciſe them, and
reform their Diſcipline; and it was at this Time,
that he inſtituted the famous <hi>Macedonian Phalanx,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He irſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx.</note> 
which did ſo much Execution. It was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
upon the ancient Manner of fighting
among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who generally drew up their
Foot ſo cloſe, as to ſtand the Shock of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
without being broken. The compleat Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx
was thought to contain above ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0761100600:240"/>
Men; tho' it was alſo taken in general for
any Company, or Party of Soldiers, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
for the whole Body of the Foot. But this
of <hi>Philip's</hi> Invention, is deſcrib'd by <hi>Polybius</hi> to
be a long Square, conſiſting of eight thouſand
Pikemen, ſixteen deep, and five hundred in Front,
the Men ſtanding ſo cloſe together, that the Pikes
of the fifth Rank were extended three Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Line of the Front. The reſt, whoſe
Diſtance from the Front made their Pikes uſeleſs,
reſted them upon the Shoulders of thoſe who
ſtood before them, and ſo locking them together
in File, preſs'd forwards to ſupport and puſh on
the former Ranks, whereby the Aſfault was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
more violent and irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p>In this Year died <hi>Xenophon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xenophon his Death, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> and in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Year of his Age. Notwithſtanding the
Glory he had acquir'd by his <hi>Perſian</hi> Expedition,
he was baniſh'd <hi>Athens</hi> for having been engag'd
in it: For <hi>Cyrus</hi> having been too great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> did not
think he ought to receive any Countenance or
Aſſiſtance from them in the Quarrel with his
Brother <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Xenophon</hi> choſe
to return again into <hi>Perſia,</hi> where he join'd <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus;</hi>
and there they contracted a ſtrict Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which continu'd as long as they liv'd. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which of theſe two Expeditions it was, that
the Sentence of Baniſhment was paſs'd againſt
him, is not determin'd: But he had by both of
them incurr'd the Diſpleaſure of his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Citizens,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0761100600:241"/>
who look'd upon him as not being well
affected to the Intereſt of his Country. He has
not by his Actions given any Marks of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt it: But it is certain, that he was a
great Admirer of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Manners and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and had a very indifferent Opinion of
the <hi>Athenian Democracy.</hi> Upon his ſecond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Greece,</hi> he reſided at <hi>Scillonte,</hi> a Town
in the <hi>Elean</hi> Territory, but at that Time under
the Dominion of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But upon the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Laconia</hi> by <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> he quitted that
Neighbourhood, and retir'd to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he
ſpent the Remainder of his Days. It is to the
Leiſure he enjoy'd in theſe Places of Retreat,
that we owe moſt of his Hiſtorical and other
Writings; by which he appears to have poſſeſs'd
more different Talents, and to have been more
thoroughly accompliſh'd, than any Man of his
Time, not only as a Captain, Philoſopher, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Hiſtorian, but being likewiſe well skill'd
in Politicks, in Horſemanſhip and Hunting, in
Tillage and Planting. He had alſo the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a very beautiful Perſon, with a pleaſing
Aſpect, which beſpoke that Candour and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
for which he was ſo remarkable, both in
his Manners and his Writings.</p>
               <p>His Character as an Hiſtorian having already
been deſcrib'd in the Account I have given of
the Authors, from whom this Hiſtory is collected,
I will here only add an Obſervation, that he was
the firſt Philoſopher in <hi>Greece,</hi> who wrote an
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0761100600:242"/>
Hiſtory. And to this it may be aſcrib'd,
that he has expreſs'd Nature better than moſt
other Hiſtorians of his Time: His Conceptions
were clear, and that made his Diction ſo. This
regular way of thinking, and digeſting his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he learnt of <hi>Socrates,</hi> under whom he ſtudied.
Nothing is more to be admir'd in him, than the
Affection he bore to his Maſter. And in this
Part <hi>Plato</hi> agreed with him; but there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
no good Underſtanding between them:
Which is the more extraordinary, becauſe they
were both equally of a mild and amiable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and had no Enemies, but ſuch as their
Virtue had created them. The Cauſe aſſign'd
by <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> for their Diſagreement,
was a Rivalſhip in their Writings; and in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prot
of this Opinion, it is ſaid, that <hi>Xenophon</hi>
wrote his <hi>Cyripaedia,</hi> as the Picture of a juſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
in Oppoſition to that which <hi>Plato</hi> had
drawn of a perfect Common-wealth. It is a
Queſtion among the Learned, how far this Piece
of <hi>Xenophon</hi> will bear being examin'd according
to the ſtrict Rules of Hiſtory; and whether it
ought not rather to be look'd upon only as a
more modeſt and inſtructive Species of Romance.
There is likewiſe great Allowance to be made
for his Character of <hi>Ageſlaus,</hi> which is too much
in the Stile of Panegyrick. But his cloſe Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
with that Prince, had made him partial
to his Failings. He extols his perſonal Bravery,
and his other private Virtues, and very juſtly:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0761100600:243"/>
But he does not conſider him enough in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Capacity, as one, who, upon the Merit of
his Services, had got more Power into his Hands,
than was uſually allow'd to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings,
and, by his Raſhneſs and Obſtinacy, had made
an ill uſe of it, almoſt to the Deſtruction of his
Country.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> had made ſome proper Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Affairs at home, he began to look
abroad, in order to divert the Storms which
threaten'd him from all Quarters. By Mony
and Promiſes he made up Matters, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
with ſuch of his Enemies, as lay neareſt
to him, and then turn'd his Forces againſt the
<hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats the Athenians.</note> who were march'd up to <hi>Methone,</hi> to
aſſiſt <hi>Argaeus.</hi> He gave them Battle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
them; and the Death of <hi>Argaeus,</hi> who
was kill'd in the Action, put an End to that
Diſpute: For he permitted the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when
they were in his Power, to return home. This
Inſtance of his Moderation gain'd ſo far upon
them, that they ſoon after concluded a Peace
with him; which yet he obſerv'd no longer,
than it ſerv'd his Deſign of ſecuring the other
Part of his Dominions.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he march'd Northward,<note place="margin">Olymp. 105. 2. Subdues the Paeonians, and the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrians.</note> where
he broke with the <hi>Paeonians,</hi> and ſubdu'd them;
then fell upon the <hi>Illyrains,</hi> and having kill'd
above ſeven thouſand of them in a pitch'd Battle,
oblig'd them to reſtore all their Conqueſts in
<hi>Macedonia.</hi> He had alſo ſhut up the Paſſage of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0761100600:244"/>
the <hi>Thracians;</hi> but yet did not think it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſecur'd, without making himſelf Maſter of
<hi>Amphipolis,</hi> which was very commodiouſly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
on the River <hi>Strymon,</hi> and was the <hi>Key</hi> of
that Side of his Dominions.<note place="margin">Seizes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phipolis.</note> He knew the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of it, and therefore poſſeſs'd himſelf of
it in the Beginning of his Reign. This was the
Grounds of his Quarrel with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who
claim'd it as one of their Colonies, and made
ſuch a Point of it, that their ſetting up <hi>Argaeus</hi>
againſt him, was not ſo much for his own Sake,
or for the Credit of impoſing a King upon the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> as it was with a View to get the
City reſtor'd to them by his Means, in caſe he
ſhould have ſucceeded in his Pretenſions. <hi>Philip</hi>
was ſenſible of their Drift; and finding it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
at that Time to keep ſome Meaſures with
them, would neither keep the Place himſelf, nor
let them have it, but took a middle Courſe, and
declar'd it a Free City, thereby leaving the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
to throw off their Dependence on their
old Maſters, and making it appear to be their
own Act. But the City continu'd no longer in
this State, than till he found himſelf at liberty to
make a more thorough Conqueſt of it; which at
this Time he eaſily effected,<note place="margin">Olymp. 105. 3.</note> thro' the Remiſſneſs
of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who refus'd to ſend any Relief
to it, alledging in their Excuſe, that it would be
a Breach of the Peace, which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with <hi>Philip</hi> the Year before. But the
Truth is, he trick'd them out of it, by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0761100600:245"/>
of delivering it up to them: But inſtead of
keeping his Word with them, he made further
Encroachments, by ſeizing on <hi>Pydna</hi> and <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi>
the latter of which being garriſon'd by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tbenians,</hi>
he drew them out, and ſent them home;
but diſmiſs'd them with ſuch Marks of Civility, as
ſhew'd, that he avoided coming to an open Rupture
with that State, at leaſt till his Deſigns were more
ripe for it, tho' at the ſame time he did what he
could to weaken them, and drive them out of his
Neighbourhood.<note place="margin">Pydna and Potidaea,</note> 
                  <hi>Pydna,</hi> with the Territory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, he gave up to the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> who
were his Father's inverterate Enemies. His Hands
were too full at this time to revive the Quarrel
againſt ſo rich and powerful a City, whcih, for
three Years together, had withſtood the united
Forces of <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Macedonia;</hi> he therefore
choſe to buy their Friendſhip for the preſent, and
to amuſe them by the Delivery of this Town, as
he had done the <hi>Athenians</hi> by the Peace, till he
could attack them at more Advantage. In this
Step alſo he over-reach'd the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were
at the ſame time courting the Alliance of the
<hi>Olynthians,</hi> in order to maintain their ſooting in
thoſe Parts. Which Side ſoever the <hi>Olynthians</hi>
inclin'd to, they were ſtrong enough to turn
the Balance; and therefore the gaining them
became a Matter of great Contention between
<hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Place he took,<note place="margin">and Creni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae, which be called Philippi.</note> was <hi>Crenidae,</hi> which
he enlarg'd, and call'd, after his own Name,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0761100600:246"/>
                  <hi>Philippi,</hi> and which afterwards was famous for
the defeat of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius.</hi> There were
near this Town ſome gold Mines, which he
work'd, and drew out of them an immenſe
Treaſure. The yearly Produce of them amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a thouſand Talents; which was reckon'd
at that time conſiderably more than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of <hi>Athens;</hi> and yet that was thought
the richeſt State in <hi>Greece.</hi> This was a very
lucky Diſcovery for one, who knew the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and Uſe of Mony ſo well as he did. He
was by this means enabled to keep up a good
Body of mercenary Troops at home, with a
great Number of Spies and Penſioners abroad;
and it was to this Fund, that he ow'd a great
Part of the Succeſſes of his Reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip,</hi> in this Progreſs of his Affairs, met
with little Oppoſition from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who
had enough to do to ſupport their Juriſdiction
in other Parts.<note place="margin">Factions in Eubaea compos'd by the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> 
                  <hi>Euboea</hi> being at this time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into Factions, one Party had recourſe to
them, and the other to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who by this
means got footing in the Iſland. But the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>
thought it of too great Importance
to them to be given up: For, beſides
other Advantages, they had formerly drawn a
large Revenue from it. However they did not
exert themſelves ſo vigorouſly as the Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
'till they were ſpirited up by <hi>Timotheus.
What?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>The</hi> Thebans <hi>in</hi> Eubaea, <hi>and
you ſtill here! They are in Action, and you are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0761100600:247"/>
deliberating. You have not ſpread the Seas with
your Shipping; you are not running down to the</hi>
Piraeus; <hi>you are not under Sail.</hi> This Manner
of haranguing had the Effect he propos'd: In
five Days time they made the neceſſary Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and put to Sea; forc'd the <hi>Thebans</hi>
off the Iſland; compos'd the Differences of the
Inhabitants, and brought them again under their
Dependence. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> takes particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this Speech of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and quotes this
Part of it, as an Incentive to the <hi>Athenians</hi>
upon a like Occaſion, when <hi>Philip</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
their Dominions in <hi>Thrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> had no ſooner put an end to
theſe Diſturbances, but <hi>Byzantium,</hi> with the
Iſlands of <hi>Chios, Cos</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Social War.</note> revolted, and

gave riſe to that which was call'd <hi>The War of the

<hi>Chares</hi> and <hi>Chabrias,</hi> with Men and Shipping, to
reduce them. Their firſt Attempt was upon

forc'd his Entrance into the Harbour;<note place="margin">Attempt upon <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os.</hi>
                  </note> but being
deſerted by the reſt of the Fleet, which put
back to Sea, he was immediately ſurrounded
by the Enemy, who beat upon him on all
ſides 'till his Ship was quite diſabled, and pierc'd
through with the Enemies Beaks. Whereupon
the Men on board leap'd into the Sea to ſave
themſelves by ſwimming: But he not thinking
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0761100600:248"/>
it conſiſtent with his Honour and the Duty
of his Poſt, to quit his Ship, ſtood obſtinately

wounded.<note place="margin">Chabrias kill'd:</note> 
                  <hi>Nepos</hi> ſays, contrary to the general
Account of this Expedition, that he ſerved in
it only as a private Man; which, if it were
ſo, would be the beſt Excuſe that could be
made for his Conduct in it: For conſidering
him as a Commander,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> it was certainly too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted,
and too raſh and deſperate an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
to be juſtified. But it was agreeable to
a Maxim of his own, <hi>That an Army of Stags
led by a Lion, was more formidable than an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Lions led by a Stag.</hi> He had another
Maxim, which ſhew'd more Prudence and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,
<hi>That He was the beſt Commander,
who knew beſt what his Enemies were doing.</hi>
However, the Spirit he ſhew'd upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
with the many other Inſtances of his
Bravery and Zeal for the Service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
may be ſufficient to rank him with the

               <p>The News of this Expedition of <hi>Chares</hi> was
at firſt very well receiv'd by the Government
of <hi>Athens,</hi> in regard the Troops which were
employ'd in it, were paid by <hi>Artabazus;</hi> and
that indeed was the only pretence that could
be made for undertaking it: But when they
found in what manner the <hi>Perſian</hi> King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it, they made it a Charge of Treaſon

the Appearance of a Crime, in refuſing to
join with him in ruſhing headlong upon the
Enemy in a Storm, and combating the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But this Matter was ſo aggravated by
<hi>Chares,</hi> that they underwent a formal Trial
for it, and, beſides the revoking their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
had an heavy Fine impos'd on them.
This is the Account <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> gives of
it: But the Fact is by others related differently,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0761100600:251"/>
and with more remarkable Circumſtances;<note place="margin">Timothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us fined.</note> That
<hi>Timotheus</hi> was fined an hundred Talents; which
being unable to pay, he withdrew himſelf to
<hi>Chalcis,</hi> where he died. The People ſoon after
repenting of their Uſage of him, (as it was
generally the Caſe with them, when it was too
late) remitted nine Parts of the Fine, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
the other ten Talents of his Son <hi>Conon</hi>
towards the Repair of their Walls. It was an
odd Circumſtance, and a Reproach to <hi>Athens,</hi>
that thoſe Walls, which had been rebuilt by

               <p>
                  <hi>Iphicrates</hi> apprehending the ſame Fate with
<hi>Timotheus,</hi> had introduced a Number of young
Men into the Court, arm'd with Daggers,
which they every now and then, in the courſe
of the Trial, took care to expoſe to the View
of his Judges, in order to intimidate them.
This Menace had the Effect he propos'd, and
accordingly he was acquitted.<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he ſhould not have endeavour'd to
do the ſame for himſelf.</hi> And certainly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Inſult it was upon the publick Juſtice, it
was owing to the People themſelves, who, by
their capricious, jealous and ungrateſul Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0761100600:252"/>
towards their Generals, had forc'd them to
theſe Extremities. For whatever their Conduct
were, they never knew when they were ſafe. They
were no longer regarded, than they were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and when their Service was over, it was
approv'd or cenſur'd, according as the Faction
for or againſt them prevail'd: In ſhort they
lay at the Mercy of every little deſigning <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogue,</hi>
who had Art enough to inflame the
Multitude. Under theſe Diſcouragements, it is
not to be wonder'd at, that many of them
engag'd themſelves in Foreign Service, or went
into a voluntary Exile; inſomuch that there
were ſcarce any left to command at home.
This is to be look'd upon as one principal
Cauſe of the Decay of the Power of <hi>Athens,</hi>
which began now too viſibly to appear. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi>
ſeems to fix it to this Period of Time, and
obſerves, that <hi>Chabrias, Iphicrates</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
were the laſt of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captains.
However, it muſt be confeſs'd, there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſiderable Men after them, who occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſignaliz'd themſelves in the Defence, or
other neceſſary Service of their Country: But
it is certain, there was not any Number, or
regular Succeſſion of ſuch, as were able to keep
up the ancient Spirit and Diſcipline of the
Troops, or the Grandeur of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>As
to <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> whether, after his Trial, he
declined the Service, or was laid aſide by the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0761100600:253"/>
State, we hear no more of his being employ'd
either at home, or abroad; and yet he is ſaid
to have liv'd to a good old Age. However
<hi>Diodorus</hi> ſays, he was dead, when the great
Battle of <hi>Cehronêa</hi> was fought in the hundred
and tenth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but without mentioning
the Time and Circumſtances of his Death;
and therefore we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that
he ſpent the Remainder of his Days in ſome
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bſcure Retirement.<note place="margin">Character of Iphicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> But whatever became of
him, he was at this time a great Loſs to the
Publick. He had ſerved on many Occaſions,
and generally with Succeſs; which was chiefly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wing to his Skill and Prudence; and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
had been very uſeful and ſeaſonable. He
was not ſo much noted for the Fame of his
Exploits, as for his Art and Improvements in
the military Diſcipline, wherein he was very
exact, and withal ſevere. He was always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Guard, and left as little room for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idents
as poſſible. To this purpoſe, when one
ask'd him, why he fortify'd his Camp, which
he had pitch'd in a Country belonging to his
Confederates, he replied, <hi>The worſt Speech a
General can make, is, I did not think.</hi> His Men
were ſo perfect in their Exerciſe, and ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to Command, that when the Word was
given to engage, they knew their Buſineſs,
and did it of themſelves, as if every private
Man had been directed by the ableſt Oſſicer.
This was particularly experienc'd in the War
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0761100600:254"/>
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he put a ſtop to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs

Repute, was, that in an Action wherein he
was wounded, he caught up one of his Enc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and carried him alive, and in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
to his own Ship. Beſides the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he made by his perſonal Merit, he had
the good Fortune to obtain in Marriage a

<hi>Iphicrates,</hi> in addition to his warlike
Talents, had the Reputation of a good Speaker:
But <hi>Plutarch</hi> blames him for going out of his
Province; and ſays, he made himſelf ridiculous
by getting Company to his Houſe to declaim
to them. He likewiſe mentions an Inſtance of
his being quite overpower'd by the Eloquence
of his Antagoniſt: But <hi>Iphicrates</hi> would not

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0761100600:256"/>
was fined an hundred Talents, and forc'd to
fly his Country, becauſe he was not able to
pay it. He was the more ſenſibly affected
with this Misfortune, becauſe he had hardly
known before what it was to ſuffer any. He
had generally ſucceeded in every thing he took
in hand; inſomuch that ſome who envied him
on that Score, painted him aſleep, with Fortune
by his Side, and caſting Nets over Cities. He
did not underſtand Raillery upon this head,
but inſiſted ſeriouſly, That Fortune had no Share
with him in his Victories, but that they were
owing intirely to his Merit. <hi>Hereupon,</hi> ſays
Plutarch, <hi>The Goddeſs grew angry, and forſook him;</hi>
and adds, <hi>That from thenceforward nothing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
with him.</hi> However, in the main he was
ſo ſucceſsful, that it is ſaid, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ow'd
to him the Recovery of their Dominion at

it; but his Father <hi>Conon</hi> had laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of it by the Engagement at <hi>Cnidus;</hi>

the <hi>Athenians</hi> took advantage of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of their Affairs, even when they were

Enemics. Beſides the military Virtues of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus,</hi>
wherein he was equal to his Father,
he was better skill'd in the Civil Part of the
Adminiſtration. He had, by his Parts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0761100600:257"/>
attain'd to a good Degree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>In this firſt Year of the 106th <hi>Olympiad,

However, to ſtrengthen his Authority, and give

               <p>Theſe were the Tranſactions of the two firſt

whoſe Body <hi>Philip</hi> caus'd to be hang'd
up; and the Priſoners he order'd to be thrown
into the Sea, as guilty of the Sacrilege. This
rais'd an Opinion of his Zeal for Religion, which
he knew how to make a right uſe of: And it
paſs'd likewiſe for a Mark of his Juſtice and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,

The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> very well deſerv'd this
Piece of Service: For the Succeſs of the Battle
was owing chiefly to their Horſe; which <hi>Philip</hi>
was ſo ſenſible of, that he took care to maintain

of his protecting the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> againſt

himſelf in a more extraordinary manner; and
he had from this time forwards ſo great a Share
in the Affairs of the Publick, that a particular
Account of him, beſides the doing Juſtice to the
Character of ſo wonderful a Man, may ſerve, in
a great meaſure, to explain and illuſtrate the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of the Times he liv'd in. The chief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that has been paid to his Memory, has
generally been on account of his Eloquence. But
he was likewiſe a very able Stateſman, and a good
Patriot; and conſidering the Embaſſies and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions,
the Treaties and Alliances, and other
various Negotiations wherein he was employ'd
together with the Zeal and Integrity with which
he acted in them, it may be queſtion'd whether
he did not excel as much in thoſe Capacities, a

in this Art, he ſet out under great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages:
For he had an Impediment in his
Speech, with a weak Voice, and a ſhort Breath,
and a very uncouth and ungracious Manner;
however by Dint of Reſolution, and infinite
Pains, he overcame all theſe Defects. He
would climb up ſteep and craggy Places to help
his Wind, and ſtrengthen his Voice; he would
declaim with Pebbles in his Mouth, to remedy
the Imperfection in his Speech; he would place

Means of riſing in the State. His firſt Eſſay
at the Bar, was two Years after this Incident
when he call'd his Guardians to account for im

who ſeems to be confounded with <hi>Neoptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
and <hi>Andronicus,</hi> who were likewiſe famous
Comedians; and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> is ſaid to have been
inſtructed by all three of them.</p>
               <p>With theſe Advantages and Improvements, he
appear'd again in publick, and ſucceeded ſo well,
that People flock'd from all Parts of <hi>Greece</hi> to
hear him. From hence he was look'd upon as
the Standard of true Eloquence; inſomuch that
none of his Countrymen have been put in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
with him; nor even among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
any but <hi>Cicero:</hi> And tho' it has been made a

themſelves with deſcribing their different Beauties
and ſhewing that they were both perfect in their

kind of Eloquence was grave and auſtere, lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
his Temper, but withal maſculine and ſublime
bold, forcible and impetuous; abounding with
Metaphors, Apoſtrophes, and Interrogations
which, with his ſolemn way of invoking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to the Gods, the Planets, the Elements,
and the <hi>Manes</hi> of thoſe who ſell at <hi>Salamis</hi> and
<hi>Marathon,</hi> had ſuch a wonderful Effect upon his
Hearers, that they thought him inſpir'd. If he
had not ſo much Softneſs and Inſinuation, as is
often requiſite in an Orator, it was not that he
wanted Art and Delicacy, when the Cafe requir'd
it; he knew how to found the Inclinations of the
People, and to lead them to the Point he aim'd
at, and ſometimes by ſeeming to propoſe that
which was directly contrary to it. But his chief
Characteriſtick was Vehemence, both in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Expreſſion; and indeed that was the
Qualification of all others moſt wanted at this
time. For the People were grown ſo inſolent
and imperious, ſo factious and divided, ſo jealous
of the Power of the <hi>Democracy,</hi> and withal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as that Spirit and Reſolution, that Force and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy
of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> to humble them, to unite
them, and to rouſe them into a Senſe of their
common Danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0761100600:271"/>
But neither could <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> himſelf have
made ſuch Impreſſions on them, if his Talent of
ſpeaking had not been ſupported by their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Integrity. It was that which added
Weight and Emphaſis to every thing he ſaid,
and animated the Whole. It was that which
chiefly engag'd their Attention, and determin'd
their Counſels, when they were convinc'd that he
ſpoke from his Heart, and had no Intereſt to
manage, but that of the Community. And this
he gave the ſtrongeſt Proofs of in his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Philip,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He was of more Weight
againſt him, than all the Fleets and Armies of the</hi>
Athenians; and that <hi>he had no Enemy but</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes.
He was not wanting in his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to corrupt him, as he had moſt of the leading
Men in <hi>Greece;</hi> but he withſtood all his Offers,
and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, <hi>all the Gold of</hi> Macedonia <hi>could
not bribe him.</hi> And yet as inflexible as he was to
<hi>Philip,</hi> he became more pliable in the Reign of
his Succeſſor, and gave occaſion to his Enemies
to accuſe him of Bribery; for which he was
fin'd and impriſon'd, and afterwards baniſh'd.
This Charge againſt him has by ſome been
thought a malicious and groundleſs Calumny,
and the rather, becauſe he was not allow'd to
juſtify himſelf. But the Fact is ſo generally
related by others, and with ſo many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that it is not eaſily to be reſuted. The
Caſe in ſhort was, That <hi>Harpalus,</hi> an Officer of
<hi>Allexander's,</hi> having imbezzled a great Part of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0761100600:272"/>
the Treaſure that he had been entruſted with,
made up a Purſe, and retir'd with it to <hi>Athens</hi>
for Protection. It was debated by the People,
whether they ſhould admit him, for fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
his Maſter's Diſpleaſure, and involving
themſelves in a War; and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in that Light, oppos'd it. <hi>Harpalus,</hi> to
remove all Difficulties, diſpers'd his Mony pretty
liberally among the Orators; and as he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
his Wealth, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> happen'd to fix
his Eyes on a rich Gold Cup of the King's,
and admiring the Sculpture and Faſhion, ask'd
the Price of it. <hi>Harpalus</hi> took the Hint, and
at Night ſent it home to him, together with
twenty Talents in Mony. The next Day he
appear'd in the Aſſembly muffled up about his
Throat; and when he was expected to ſpeak to
the Point in Queſtion, he made Signs that he
had loſt his Voice. But his Tranſaction with
<hi>Harpalus</hi> had taken Wind; and when he found
himſelf detected, he roſe up to excuſe it; but
the People were ſo enrag'd, that they would not
hear him: Whereupon a certain Wag ſtood up
and ſaid, <hi>What, will ye not hear the King's Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer?</hi>
Others ſaid, <hi>Surely, the Orator had not
been ſeiz'd that Night with a Silver Squinzy;</hi> and
they had coin'd a<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> Word on purpoſe to expreſs
it. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> could not ſtand this Contempt
and Raillery of his Fellow-Citizens, who had
hitherto eſteem'd and reſpected him, even to a
Sort of Reverence; and it affected him the more,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0761100600:273"/>
becauſe he had piqu'd himſelf ſo much more
than others upon the Rigidneſs of his Virtue,
which indeed was the chief Foundation of that
extraordinary Reſpect which had been paid him.
But the Itch of Mony had infected him; and
this was not the only inſtance of his receiving
Preſents in a clandeſtine and unwarrantable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
As a further Argument that he did not
deſpiſe Mony, he was reproach'd with dealing
in Bottomry, which in thoſe Days was look'd
upon as a ſcandalous way of Traffick: And
therefore <hi>Zeno,</hi> who likewiſe practis'd it ſome
time after him, gave it up as a thing that would
hurt the Credit of his Philoſophy. But however
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was in ſome Degree tainted with the
general Corruption of the Times, he does not
ſeem to have lov'd Mony ſo much for its own
Sake, as to ſerve the Ends of his Ambition:
Wherein he copied after <hi>Pericles,</hi> whom he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
choſe to imitate in his manner of ſpeaking.
He had not the Command as the other had of
the publick Mony, and therefore was not in a
Capacity of doing ſo many great and popular
Acts: But he repair'd the City Walls, ſitted out
Ships, ranſom'd Slaves, married poor Maidens,
entertain'd the People with Shews and Sports,
and did ſuch other things of that kind, as were
within the Compaſs of his private Fortune. And
this ſeems the moſt plauſible way of accounting
for the Methods he took to get Mony, and to
improve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0761100600:274"/>
But whatever might be alledg'd in his Excuſe
as to Mony Matters, he had another Failing,
which, by his own confeſſion, he was guilty
of, and that was want of Courage, as will be
more particularly related in its proper Place. In
the mean time, I would only obſerve the ſtrange
Inconſiſtency in the Compoſition of this Great
Man, who, with ſuch Conſtancy and Intrepidity,
oppos'd all the Meaſures of the Foreign and
Domeſtick Enemies of his Country, and who ſo
often, at the Hazard of his Life, brav'd the
Madneſs of the People in their Aſſemblies, and
yet could not ſtand an Enemy in the Field. <hi>He
choſe,</hi> ſays Plutarch, <hi>to ſwear by thoſe who fell at</hi>
Maratnon, <hi>tho' he could not follow their Example.</hi>
And what is ſtill more extraordinary, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
refus'd Life when it was offer'd him; and
Nobody died with greater Fortitude. Theſe
Frailties which I have mention'd, could not but
take off a great deal from the Luſtre of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter;
inſomuch that <hi>Phocion,</hi> who ſucceeded
him, tho' in ſeveral Reſpects he was not equal
to him, beſides that he was ſuſpected to favour
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Intereſt, yet being more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for his perſonal Juſtice and Valour, he
was therefore look'd upon as the greater Man.
However <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> ſuch as he was, did more
Service to the State than any of his Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries:
He was the chief Bulwark, not only of
<hi>Athens,</hi> but of <hi>Greece</hi> in general, and almoſt
the only Obſtacle to <hi>Philip's</hi> Deſigns of enſlaving
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0761100600:275"/>
it. Which leads us now into an Enquiry how
thoſe Deſigns were laid, and how far they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>The
two next Years of the <hi>Phocian</hi> War paſs'd
without any memorable Action, tho' it was ſtill
continu'd by Skirmiſhes and mutual Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Philip</hi> had now no Part in it. But when
he found himſelf ſhut out of <hi>Greece</hi> by the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> he turn'd his Arms againſt thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Places, which depended on them, either as
Colonies, or as Conqueſts: and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> whom he had long look'd
upon with an evil Eye, but had courted and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joled
them whilſt he was otherwiſe employ'd.
But he came now reſolv'd entirely to reduce 'em;<note place="margin">Olymp. 108. 1. Philip's Deſign upon Olynthus.</note> 
and advancing towards the City, only ſent them
a ſhort Meſſage, to let them know, <hi>That one of
theſe two Points was become neceſſary, either that
they muſt quit</hi> Olynthus, <hi>or he</hi> Macedonia: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they ſent immediately to <hi>Athens</hi> for Relief.
The Matter was debated there with great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was very earneſt in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
their Demand:<note place="margin">Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes preſſes the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it:</note> In the doing whereof,
he took occaſion to lay open the Deſigns and
Practices of <hi>Philip,</hi> inveighing againſt him with
great Bitterneſs, and urging every thing that
might ſerve to incenſe the People againſt him.
He deſcrib'd him as a proud tyrannical Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,<note place="margin">Deſertbes Philip.</note> and a common Diſturber of Mankind;
without Faith or Confidence; without any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Honour or Juſtice, or any Regard to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0761100600:276"/>
Laws, Human or Divine. Then as to the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
they might apprehend from him, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him likewiſe as politick, vigilant, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable,
intrepid and fortunate, who fought as
ſucceſsfully with his Mony as his Sword, and
knew how to corrupt where he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.
But leſt, from this Account of him, he
ſhould appear ſo formidable to the People, that
they might be diſcourag'd from endeavouring to
ſtop his Progreſs, he ſhew'd him in another
Light, as vain, preſumptuous, raſh and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
forming Schemes without any Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and meaſuring the Vaſtneſs of his Deſigns
only by the Standard of his Ambition. From
theſe different Views of him, which were varied
according to the different Impreſſions that were
to be made upon the People, we may collect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the whole of his Character: But the Orator,
in framing this Picture of him, muſt be ſaid to
have drawn the Lines a little too ſtrong, and to
have heighten'd the Colours too much by the
Warmth of his Zeal, and the Force of his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
And yet theſe Exaggerations were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
at this Time, in order to inflame the
People: For <hi>Philip</hi> had his Partizans among the
Orators, who combated and oppos'd every thing
that was urg'd againſt him.</p>
               <p>One of the ableſt and moſt zealous of them,<note place="margin">Character of Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> 
was <hi>Demades,</hi> who was very ready and acute,
and remarkable for ſpeaking <hi>extempore,</hi> as any
Occaſion offer'd. Herein he had manifeſtly the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0761100600:277"/>
Advantage of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> whoſe Works were
ſaid <hi>to ſmell of the Lamp.</hi> And hence it was,
that <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> being ask'd his Opinion of the
two Orators, anſwer'd, <hi>That</hi> Demoſthenes <hi>was
worthy of the City of</hi> Athens; <hi>but that</hi> Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<hi>was above it.</hi> However <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had,
upon ſome very important Occaſions, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well in the unpremeditated way of haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing;
but it being not his uſual Method, nor
his natural Talent, he diſcouraged the Practice
of it. And therein he made uſe of an artful
Argument, That to ſpeak before the People
in an abrupt manner, and without due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
was not treating them with Reſpect;
that it had ſomewhat of an <hi>Oligarchical</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in it, and was rather bearing them down by
Force, than winning them by Perſuaſion. As
to <hi>Demades,</hi> whatever his Wit and Parts were,
he was very mercenary and corrupt: And when
he was charg'd with it, he ſaid, <hi>He had often
ſpoke againſt himſelf, but never againſt his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
But there is an Inſtance recorded of him,
wherein he ſeem'd rather to value himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, than to excuſe it: For meeting one day with
a Player, who had receiv'd a Talent as a Reward
for a Part that he had excell'd in, <hi>It is not ſo
extraodinary,</hi> ſaid Demades, <hi>to have one Talent
given you for ſpeaking; I had Ten given me for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Tongue.</hi> His proſtituting himſelf in this
manner, was chiefly to ſupport his Luxury: For
he was naturally profuſe and gluttonous; and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0761100600:278"/>
hence it was, that when he was grown
old, <hi>Antipater</hi> compar'd him to a ſacrificed
Beaſt, of which all the Parts were conſum'd,
but the Tongue and the Paunch. He was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon good Terms with <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it ſerv'd his preſent Purpoſe: but
the Rivaiſhip in their Profeſſion, with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Caſt of their Tempers and their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
made it impracticable for them to live
in any real Friendſhip. On the contrary, they
were generally at Variance; and at length it
came to an open Enmity, which in the Sequel
will appear to have coſt <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another of the ſame Stamp with <hi>Demades,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and of Hyperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> 
was <hi>Hyperides,</hi> both as to his Parts and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and his riotous Manner of living. He
had a more premeditated way of ſpeaking; but
with the ſame kind of Wit and Acrimony, tho'
he was not ſo quick. He is generally rank'd
with <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and is mention'd as one of
the Ten Principal Orators of that Age, tho'
<hi>Plutarch</hi> does not reckon him in that Number.
He took a great deal of pains to ingratiate
himſelf with the People, and had no Ties of
Faith or Friendſhip, but as they ſerv'd that
End. However he was not much in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Affairs 'till the Reign of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi>
And then he acted ſuch a double Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
between the Patriot and the Traitor, that he
was at laſt enſnar'd by his own Politicks, and
ſell a Sacrifice to the Reſentment of <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:0761100600:279"/>
Such were moſt of the leading Men in the
Aſſemblies, and ſuch was generally their End.
To carry on their own private Views, they
inflamed the People, and deluded them with
falſe Colours, 'till they had drawn them either
into an unneceſſary War, or a bad Peace: But
ſooner or later they ſuffer'd for it, and were
either made particular Marks of Vengeance, or
involved in the common Ruin of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
This was more remarkably the Caſe at
<hi>Athens,</hi> which had been always look'd upon
as the chief Seat of Eloquence, and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
with ſo many eminent Speakers as at
this time. But that which was the Glory
of this Common-wealth, muſt at the ſame time
be conſider'd as one principal Cauſe that haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
its Downfall, and drew along with it that
of the other <hi>Grecian</hi> States.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> his ſteady and

vice for which they were intended. The wealthier
Sort complain'd, that the Burthen lay wholly
upon them, and that the Publick Mony was
ſquander'd away in Shews and Feſtivals, for
the Entertainment of the lower Rank of the
Citizens, who fat at their Eaſe, and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing to the Support of the Publick,
either in their Purſe, or their Perſons. They
retorted upon the Rich, that they enjoy'd all
the Honours and great Offices of the State,
excluſive of the common People; and as they
had the Law on their Side, with Numbers to
ſupport it, they gave little Attention to any
Remonſtrances that were made upon this Head.
<hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who had nothing in view but the
General Good, thought it neceſſary to ſound
the People upon this Subject, and enter'd as
far into it as he could with Safety; He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
that Commiſſioners ſhould be appointed
to inſpect the Laws in general, not in order
to make new Ones, for that there were already
too many; but that ſuch of them, as ſhould be
ſound prejudicial to the Publick, might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed.
At the ſame time he urg'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Neceſſity of raiſing Forces, and mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Theatrical Mony</hi> as the only proper
Fund for it. In Concluſion he told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Law relating to it ought to be
repeal'd. However he took care to deliver it
only as his Opinion, without propoſing it in
form, ſo as to ſubject himſelf to the Penalty.</p>

This was the Subſtance of the three famous
Orations of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> upon occaſion of three
ſeveral Applications that the <hi>Olynthians</hi> made
to <hi>Athens</hi> for Succours. The firſt of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
no Effect in their behalf. Upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>Chares</hi> was diſpatch'd to them with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Gallies and two thouſand Men. But theſe
being Hirelings and Strangers, did them very
little Service: Which occaſion'd theird Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
wherein they deſired true <hi>Athenian</hi>
Troops, whom they could better depend on.
And accordingly <hi>Chares</hi> was ſent out again

               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Olynthians</hi> continued block'd up;
and whatever Benefit they might have received
from this laſt Sapply, they were prevented by

formerly had the other of them, being jealous
of their ſupplanting him in the Throne. This
Circumſtance of his Brothers is related only by

contemplative Life, and he purſued his Studies

<hi>The Founder of the Academick Sect.</hi> That
he had no regard to the gainful Part of his

For he divided his Eſtate, which was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,

only a little Country-Seat, with a ſmall
Garden. Notwithſtanding his Application to
Study, he had none of that Gloomineſs and
Auſterity in his Temper, which was common
to moſt of his Profeſſion. On the contrary,
he was chearful and facetious, and ſometimes
lov'd Raillery; but it was always inoffenſive
and with good Manners, and only to enliven
the Converſation. He preſcrib'd the ſame Rules
of Behaviour to his Scholars; and hence it was,
that he recommended it ſo ſtrongly to them,
<hi>To ſacrifice to the Graces.</hi> He was as univerſally
belov'd and careſs'd for his engaging Manner,
and the Eaſineſs of his Temper, as he was

who had been inveigled by <hi>Philip</hi> ever ſince
his Acceſſion to the Throne, were prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to join in this new Confederacy. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſeveral other <hi>Grecian</hi> States, when they
ſound themſelves oppreſs'd by their Neighbours,
applicd to <hi>Philip</hi> for Relief, as to a common
Friend and Protector: But this was not 'till
he had a more immediate Influence in their
Affairs, by being admitted into the Aſſembly
of the <hi>Ampictyons;</hi> beſides it was the <hi>Thebans</hi>
who ſet them the Example, and who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0761100600:288"/>
to be look'd upon as the principal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers

               </p>
               <p>But tho' <hi>Philip</hi> had enter'd into theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> he conſider'd, that
the <hi>Phocians</hi> were ſupported both by <hi>Athens</hi> and
<hi>Sparta,</hi> and therefore proceeded with Caution
and Secrecy, and took time to form his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
accordingly. Amidſt theſe Deliberations,
it happen'd juſt as he could have wiſh'd, that
the <hi>Athenians</hi> being grown weary of a War,
which was ſo far from turning to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that it only gave <hi>Philip</hi> a better Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of wreſting from them their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in <hi>Thrace,</hi> had therefore ſent to ſound him
upon a Peace.<note place="margin">Athens ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiates a Peacewith Philip,</note> 
                  <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> and <hi>Phrynon,</hi> who
were employ'd in this Commiſſion, made their
Report, that he was not at all averſe to it; and
thereupon <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> with nine others, were
ſent as Ambaſſadors to negotiate it. They went
as far in it as they were authoriz'd by their
Inſtructions, and return'd with <hi>Antipater, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>
and <hi>Eurylochus</hi> on the Part of <hi>Philip.</hi>
Soon after, the Ten were diſpatch'd back again
with full Powers to put the laſt Hand to the
Treaty. <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> in the firſt of theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies,
had met with ſome <hi>Athenian</hi> Priſoners
in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whom he had promis'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
at his own Expence; and he took the
preſent Opportunity for it. In the mean time
his Colleagues were to proceed with all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
in order to conclude with <hi>Philip:</hi> but
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0761100600:289"/>
they loiter'd by the way, and were three
Months in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> before they had Acceſs
to <hi>Philip,</hi> who was all that time ravaging the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Dominions in <hi>Thrace.</hi> When at laſt
they got up to him, he agreed to the Terms
of the Treaty; but ſtill, upon one Pretence or
other, deferr'd the Execution of it, 'till at length
being advanc'd with his Troops into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi>
in order to proceed againſt the <hi>Phocians,</hi> he
found it neceſſary to conclude with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">which at laſt is concluded.</note> and accordingly ratified the Treaty.</p>
               <p>By theſe Delays, which he gain'd by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all the Ambaſſadors in general, except
<hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> he had kept the <hi>Athenians</hi> in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
'till his other Deſigns were ripe for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
However, as the Peace was at laſt
concluded, the Generality of the People were
well ſatisfy'd with it, and the Ambaſſadors, at
their Return,<note place="margin">Aeſchines vouches for Philip's Promiſes.</note> valued themſelves upon the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of their Negotiations. <hi>Aeſchines</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
who was one of them, and was intirely
devoted to <hi>Philip,</hi> expatiated largely upon his
Candour and Sincerity, and vouch'd for his
Performance of ſeveral things which he had
promis'd in behalf of the Republick, altho'
they were not ſtipulated by the Treaty; as
that <hi>Theſpiae</hi> and <hi>Plataea</hi> ſhould be repeopled;
that, in caſe he ſhould ſubdue the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
he would not deſtroy them; that he
would put the <hi>Thebans</hi> upon a reaſonable foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that <hi>Oropus</hi> ſhould be ſecured to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes gives no Credit to them.</note> 
                  <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi>
endeavour'd, with his uſual Frankneſs,
to convince the People how little Streſs there
was to be laid upon theſe Promiſes of <hi>Philip,</hi>
which, he ſaid, were made only to amuſe them,
and to divert them from his real Deſign, which
was to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Phocis;</hi> and
that their ſuffering him to ſucceed in that,
would be giving up every thing. But all that
he could ſay upon this Occaſion had no weight
with them. They were willing to be deceiv'd;
and <hi>Aeſchines</hi> knew how to work upon their
Credulity. He was in the firſt Rank of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and diſputed the Prize even with <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Account of the Conteſt between him and Aeſchines.</note> of which there was a famous Inſtance in
the Conteſt concerning the Crown, wherein the
Abilities of theſe two great Men were diſplay'd
in their higheſt Luſtre, and engaged the
Attention of all the learned Men of <hi>Greece.</hi>
The Caſe in ſhort was, That <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> among
other neceſſary Works that were committed to
his Charge, had the care of repairing the City
Walls, which he did partly at his own Expence;
and the People, in Teſtimony of their Gratitude,
decreed him a Crown of Gold. <hi>Aeſchines</hi> being
jealous of his Rival's Glory, brought an Action
againſt <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> as being the Author of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and founded it upon a Pretence, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi>
had not paſs'd his Accounts to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and therefore was not capable by Law of
receiving any Reward for his Services. This

Fact happen'd in the hundred and tenth <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid,</hi>
about the Time of the Battle of <hi>Cheronêa,</hi>

was not heard till ſeveral Years after <hi>Philip</hi>'s

whoſe Credit was then at a very low

as well by the Juſtice of his Cauſe, as by

However he exhorted him, by a generous and
diſintereſted Proceeding, to contradict theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports;
to govern his Subjects with Juſtice and
Prudence, and to give Peace to his Neighbours;
in ſhort, to ſet Bounds to his Ambition at home,
and to extend his Conqueſts in <hi>Perſia.</hi> The

from attempting any thing that might give Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
to <hi>Greece;</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> choſe this way of
gaining upon him by Mildneſs and Complaiſance;
but he was too eaſy and credulous. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>
was more a Man of Buſineſs, and knew the

of his aſpiring and intriguing Temper, who had,

Deſign, which he had ſo long projected, and
which was now ſo near taking Effect. However
the Sincerity and long Experience of <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> who

Weight to his Opinion; which, with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
that <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> and the other Penſioners

that tho' they had lately receiv'd a Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement

under the Command of their King <hi>Archidamus,</hi>
they declin'd giving him Battle, and ſent to

to any Terms, that he would give them. He
allow'd <hi>Phalecus</hi> to retire with eight thouſand
Men, being Mercenaries, into <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> but
the reſt, who were the Inhabitants of <hi>Phocis,</hi> were
left at his Mercy. As the diſpoſing of them was
a Matter wherein <hi>Greece</hi> in general was concern'd,
he did not think fit to act in it by his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Authority, but referr'd it to the <hi>Amphictyons,</hi>
whom he caus'd to be aſſembled for that Purpoſe.
But they were ſo much under his Influence, that
they ſerv'd only to give a Sanction to his Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
They decreed, <hi>That all the Cities of</hi>
Phocis <hi>ſhould be demoliſh'd; That they who had
fled, as being principally concern'd in the Sacrilege
ſhould be ſtigmatiz'd as accurs'd, and proſcrib'd a

till the Whole of what had been taken out of

adjudg'd to loſe their Seat in the Council of the

This <hi>Philip</hi> got transferr'd to himſelf;<note place="margin">He obtains a Seat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Amphic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyons,</note> which

of the Diſſenſions between the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates

Dignities, obtain'd the Sovereignty for himſelf.
However he made no ill uſe of his Power. He
ſignaliz'd himſelf by many great Actions both in
Peace and War. He not only ſtrengthen'd and
adorn'd the City, and enlarg'd the Territory,
but ſav'd the whole Iſland from falling into the
Hands of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had ſet their
Heart upon the Conqueſt of it, as lying ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for their Shipping, and were further
tempted by the Fruitfulneſs of the Soil, and
the Riches of the Inhabitants. Accordingly,
under the common Pretence of aſſiſting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Differences among them, they threw a
vaſt Number of their own, and other <hi>African</hi>
Troops into the Iſland. But their Deſigns were

The Honour of this Victory was aſcrib'd chiefly

had Recourſe to <hi>Icetes,</hi> who was a Native of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi>
but at that time govern'd the <hi>Leontines.</hi>
He readily eſpous'd their Quarrel againſt the
Tyrant, but it was in order to ſucceed him; and
with that View he enter'd into a ſecret League
with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who lay hovering about
the Iſland with a numerous Fleet. This gave
the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> a freſh Alarm; ſo that between
their Oppreſſions and Diviſions at home, and
their Appehenſions of an Invaſion from abroad,
they knew not who to apply to, nor who to

theſe Streights by their own ill Conduct. For
they did not diſtinguiſh between their Friends

and their Foes; they had all the Capriciouſneſs
and Inſolence of a Free State, without the Power;

Prayers and Entreaties, nor their Arguments an

Menaces had any effect upon him, retired at a
little diſtance from him, and ſtood weeping
with his Face cover'd, whilſt the other Two
drew their Swords, and diſpatch'd him. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus
Siculus</hi> ſays, <hi>Timoleon</hi> kill'd him with his
own Hands in the Market-place. He relates
this Story with ſeveral other different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
But the Account which <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives
of it from the Hiſtorians, who liv'd at the
time when the Fact was committed, is more
probable, and more conſiſtent and uniform, as
well as more to the Honour of <hi>Timoleon.</hi> This
Action was by ſome extoll'd and applauded as the
higheſt pitch of human Virtue, and by others
condemn'd as a baſe and unnatural Parricide.
And <hi>Timoleon</hi> himſelf, when he came to cool,
felt ſuch a Remorſe for it, that he abandon'd
himſelf to Deſpair, and reſolv'd to ſtarve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to death. His Friends with great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and even by Force, prevail'd upon him
to take ſome Suſtenance; and at length he
promis'd them he would live, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that he might quit the Service of the
Publick, and retire to ſome remote and deſart
Corner of the Country; which he accordingly
did, and for near twelve Years together, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
up and down the Fields by himſelf in
this anxious and ſorlorn Condition.</p>
               <p>He was return'd to <hi>Corinth</hi> when he was
pitch'd upon for this Command; and as he
liv'd ſtill in a retir'd way, he would gladly have
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0761100600:304"/>
declin'd it, but that he did not think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Duty he ow'd to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Before he ſet out, he was told, <hi>That as
to the Affair of his Brother, the World would
judge of it according to his Behaviour in this
Expedition; That if he acquitted himſelf well in
it, he would be ſaid to have freed his Country
from a Tyrant; if otherwiſe, he would be look'd

               </p>
               <p>Whilſt he was preparing to embark, there
came Letters from <hi>Icetes</hi> to diſſuade him from

that, in caſe he would ſend home his

Gallies, with the Troops, he might come up
himſelf to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and ſhare with him in his
Conqueſts. <hi>Timoleon</hi> had no Views of this kind;
but finding himſelf over-power'd, he ſeem'd to
hearken to their Propoſal, and to ſubmit to it
as a Caſe of Neceſſity.<note place="margin">He lands in <hi>Sicily</hi> by a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem.</note> However he deſir'd
for Form ſake, and in order to juſtify his
Conduct at his Return to <hi>Corinth,</hi> that what
had paſs'd privately between them, might be
declared in a more open manner before the
People of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> as being common Friends
to both Parties. But the leading Men among
them were in his Intereſt; and this Demand
of his was a concerted thing between them, as
a Project for his eſcaping out of their Hands.
To carry on this Deſign, an Aſſembly was
call'd, and <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Captains of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
Gallies, were admitted to it. But the People,
inſtead of entering upon the Buſineſs for which

Debates about other Matters, and ſpun
out the Time, 'till nine of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

Iſland. But few of the other Towns as yet
came in to him. They had a general Diſtruſt
of all Foreign Commanders, having found by
Experience, that they had been allured by them
with fair Promiſes, and afterwards been more
oppreſs'd by them, than by thoſe from whom
they pretended to deliver them. The <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
had a better Opinion of him; at leaſt they
had no body elſe to depend on: And yet they
had very little Hopes of Relief from him,
whilſt <hi>Icetes</hi> was in poſſeſſion of the Town,
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> of the Citadel, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
of the Harbour.</p>
               <p>His firſt Scene of Action was at <hi>Adranum</hi> a

The former was glad to take this Opportunity
of advancing further into the Country; and
the latter thought it ſo neceſſary to prevent
him, that he immediately march'd thither with
a Detachment of five thouſand Men. <hi>Timoleon</hi>
arriv'd there at the ſame time with his whole
Strength, which amounted to no more than
twelve Hundred. However taking advantage
of the Enemy, whilſt they were fixing their
Tents, he fell upon them with great Fury, and
put them to flight, having kill'd three hundred
of them, and taken double that Number of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,

Tyrant of <hi>Catana,</hi> a Man of great Wealth and

the City of <hi>Meſſina</hi> at the ſame time declared
for him. It likewiſe advanc'd his Affairs at

than to become a Prey to <hi>Icetes,</hi> whom

Accordingly <hi>Timoleon</hi> ſent four hundred Men

flock'd from all Parts, to ſee the Man who
had made ſo much Noiſe in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and whoſe
Name was become formidable even to <hi>Greece.</hi>
But he appear'd very eaſy and compoſed, and
without any Marks either of Terror, or of

his Affairs, he fell into a mean way of Life,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0761100600:308"/>
ſauntering about in the Shops and the Shambles,
drinking in Taverns, or ſquabbling with lewd

a ſucceſsful Sally, that he had kill'd one part
of the Beſiegers, and put the reſt to flight;
and that having taken <hi>Acradina,</hi> the ſtrongeſt

another; and after he had kill'd ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of their Followers, they were all three
taken and executed. The Wives and Children
of <hi>Icetes</hi> were likewiſe condemn'd and executed
by the <hi>Syracuſians;</hi> which was look'd upon as an
ungenerous Part in <hi>Timoleon,</hi> that he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe

the People, and was ſaid to be done by way of
Retaliation for the like Treatment of the Family

               <p>During theſe Tranſactions of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> the

was not conſulted. As to what remains to be

with the Account of his Death, which
happen'd two Years later.</p>
               <p>During the former Part of theſe Commotions
in <hi>Sicily, Philip</hi> was gaining Ground upon the
<hi>Illyrians,</hi> and ſettling his Conqueſts at home:
But before the re-eſtabliſhment of Affairs in that
Iſland, he had carried his Arms into <hi>Thrace</hi> and
the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> among the <hi>Athenian</hi> Colonies and
Confederates, and thereby given occaſion to freſh
Diſturbances, which ſhould have been related in
their due Order of Time; but I have choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do it now by way of Retroſpect, than
to break into the Narration of what paſs'd at <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe.</hi>
In the firſt Year of the 109th <hi>Olympiad,</hi>
he march'd into <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> and having clear'd out
the Remains of Tyranny in the ſeveral Cities
there, he not only confirm'd the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0761100600:316"/>
his Intereſt, but gain'd over many of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>Having
ſtrengthen'd himſelf in theſe Parts, he
went the next Year into <hi>Thrace,</hi> where he had form'd
a Deſign againſt the <hi>Cherſoneſe.</hi>

                  </note> This Peninſula

reſerving to himſelf only <hi>Cardia</hi> the capital City.
But <hi>Philip</hi> having ſoon after routed him of the

committing Acts of Pyracy, and of laying their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0761100600:317"/>
Allies under Contribution. But whatever Grounds
there were for this Part of the Accuſation, the
Government of <hi>Athens</hi> was principally to blame
in it: For having no proper Fund for the War,
they ſent out their Generals without Mony or
Proviſions, and left them to ſhift for themſelves,
and yet made them anſwerable for any Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
that ſhould happen for want of their being
better ſupply'd. This was a great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Service, and put thoſe who were
employ'd in it, upon pillaging and plundering
in ſuch a manner, as they would otherwiſe have
been aſham'd of. <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> in an Harangue
that he made upon the State of the <hi>Cherſoneſe,</hi>
undertook the Defence of <hi>Diopithes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes defends him,</note> And altho'
that might be the principal Deſign of his Speech;
yet he enter'd into a great Variety of other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and laid open ſo much of the preſent Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Affairs both in <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſeveral other
States of <hi>Greece,</hi> that it may be proper to give
the Reader a ſhort Account of it; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe it contains the Subſtance of what
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> has ſaid in ſome of his other Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in the ſame manner, and almoſt in the ſame
Terms, againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> and his Partizans in the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>He urg'd to the People in Behalf of <hi>Diopithes,</hi>
that he had done nothing but what his Neceſſities
had forc'd him to, and that he had only follow'd
the Example of his Predeceſſors, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
laid the Iſlanders, and other <hi>Aſiatick</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0761100600:318"/>
Allies under Contribution; and that they who
paid it, found their Account in it, in having
Convoys to ſecure them from Pyrates, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to protect their Trade. That inſtead
of being queſtion'd, for uſing his Induſtry to
procure that Subſiſtence for the Troops, which
he could not obtain from the Government, they
ought forthwith to ſend him a Reinforcement,
and to provide better for their Pay. However
he told them, That whatever Exactions or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
he had been guilty of, he was their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
and it was always in their Power to ſend
for him home, and to puniſh him, as they found
he deſerv'd. But he told them at the ſame time,
that this Accuſation was made uſe of only as an
Handle to divert them from inquiring into the
Motions and Deſigns of <hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi>
                  </note> who, with a
powerful Army in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and upon the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</hi>
was ravaging their Poſſeſſions, debauching
their Allies, and ſtirring up againſt them both
the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> That whilſt he
was engag'd in theſe Practices, he was to be
look'd upon as the firſt Aggreſſor; and that
they were not to think themſelves ſecure, becauſe
he was not come up to the <hi>Piraeus,</hi> nor was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking
them in <hi>Attica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among other Arguments to induce them to
make head againſt him, he told them, they had
more to apprehend from him, than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
had; and he explain'd it to them by an
artful Piece of Flattery:</hi> You muſt not imagine,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0761100600:319"/>
ſaid <hi>he,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> will treat you in the ſame
manner with the reſt of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that
he will content himſelf with barely making Slaves
of you. No; his Deſign is to deſtroy and extirpate
you. For he is ſenſible, that a People, who have
ſo long known what it is to command, will never
bear Servitude, and that you are incapable of doing
it, if you would: He knows, that you would be
always ſtruggling to break your Chains, and that
you would give him more Diſturbance than all the
reſt of the World. And therefore you may look
upon it as an undoubted Maxim, that he can intend
nothing leſs than you total Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>From thence he proceeded to inveigh againſt
the Orators,<note place="margin">and the Orators.</note> for the treacherous Part they had
acted upon theſe Proceedings of <hi>Philip;</hi> and he
did it with great Boldneſs and Acrimony, by
expoſing their falſe Reaſoning, their falſe Zeal,
and their falſe Courage. He told the People, it
was in vain to think of their being victorious
abroad, ſo long as they nouriſh'd in their Boſom
theſe Penſioners and Creatures of their Enemy;
theſe domeſtick Foes, who were as ſo many hidden
Rocks and Shelves, upon which they muſt one
Day unavoidably ſuffer Shipwreck. He went on
to ſhew them, that the inſolent Behaviour of
<hi>Philip</hi> towards them, was wholly owing to theſe
Haranguers, who ſav'd him the trouble of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
and undermining them, as he did the
other States, with an Appearance at leaſt of
bearing them Good-will, and doing them good

to them. That he had at preſent got the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
under his Dependence; but that he had
thought it proper to gild their Chains, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

waſte the Country of their Enemies the <hi>Phocians,</hi>
and by delivering them from a long and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome
War. <hi>But why,</hi> ſays Demoſthenes,
<hi>does he not think it worth his while to amuſe you
with ſome ſuch Marks of his Complaiſance and his
Bounty? Why does he not endeavour to gain upon
you by ſome real or pretended Benefits? On the
contrary, he infringes your Treaties, breaks into
your Alliances, and ſeizes your Poſſeſſions; and does
it with an high Hand, without ſo much as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to excuſe, or diſſemble it.</hi> He tells them
the Reaſon of this Difference in <hi>Philip</hi>'s Conduct
with regard to them, was, becauſe he had no need
of keeping any Meaſures with them, or of ſaving
Appearances: For that he knew he had a Party
among them, who were always ready to plead
his Cauſe, and to juſtify all his Proceedings.
<hi>Athens,</hi> ſays Demoſthenes, <hi>is the only City of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0761100600:321"/>
Greece,</hi> where a Man may, with Impunity, diſplay
his Eloquence in Defence, and even in Praiſe of the
common Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He expatiated further upon the baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Artifices of the Orators, in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Fellow-Citizens.</hi> They, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> who
have no real Concern for the Welfare of the
Publick, may with Eaſe and Safety cenſure, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and condemn. They can always ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from Danger by their inexhauſtible Fund of
Flattery and Diſſimulation; by their daily ſhifting
and changing their Opinion, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Taſte and Humour of the People; and by
diſguiſing and concealing from them the weak and
diſorderly State of their Affaris. <hi>The truly brave
and zealous Citizen he deſcribes in another
manner:</hi> That the only thing he has in view, is
the Peoples Intereſt; that, in order to promote
it, he oppoſes their Inclinations, combats their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and makes no Conceſſions to them out of
Complaiſance; that he delivers his Mind freely
and openly, according to the beſt of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and makes himſelf accountable to them not
only for the Reaſonableneſs of his Advice, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for the Succeſs of it. Demoſthenes <hi>does not
directly apply this Character to himſelf; but
it may be eaſily collected from what follows,
that he thought it belong'd to him.</hi> I know,
<hi>ſays he,</hi> Fellow-Citizens, as well as others, how
to flatter, to accuſe, to proſcribe, and to practiſe
all thoſe other little Arts of gaining Credit with
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0761100600:322"/>
you; but I have a Soul above it. I have no
Avarice, nor Ambition; my chief Aim is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
and inculcate thoſe Truths, which, becauſe
they are diſtaſteful to you, muſt therefore give my
Rivals the Preference in your Favour; and yet
they are ſuch, as, if you would hearken to them,
would give you the advantage over your Enemies.
It is to me a Part unworthy of a good Citizen,
to ſtudy ways of riſing on a ſudden to the higheſt
Rank of Men in <hi>Athens,</hi> when you are at the
ſame time ſinking to the loweſt Rank of Men in
<hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he had thus endeavour'd to open their
Eyes, and to free them from their Dependence
on the other Orators, he preſs'd them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
forthwith to Action. <hi>It is my part,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>to propoſe; it is yours to reſolve, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</hi>
He concludes with exhorting them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Neceſſities of the State; to keep their
Troops on foot, and in good Diſcipline; to
diſpatch Ambaſſadors to all Parts, with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to communicate their Reſolutions, and
to give notice of the common Danger that
threaten'd <hi>Greece;</hi> and thereupon to negotiate
and conclude whatever ſhould be thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for the Service of the Common-wealth.
And above all, he advis'd them to ſhew no
Mercy to thoſe who proſtituted themſelves for
Gain to the Enemy of their Country.</p>
               <p>Whatever effect theſe Remonſtrances had for
the preſent, <hi>Philip</hi> was not diſcourag'd from
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0761100600:323"/>
making further Attempts:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip</hi> takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
                  </note> And he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with a Pretence for it by the Diviſions
which were now in <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> and they were
owing chiefly to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who having lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to do in the late Foreign Tranſactions, were
recovering their Strengh at home, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

them, put themſelves under the Protection of

The natural Balance againſt it, was an
Union between <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> which the
<hi>Spartans</hi> preſs'd with great Earneſtneſs, as the
only means for their common Security; and

and put them ſo far upon their Guard,
that, without coming to an open Rupture with

               <p>This Storm in <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> was no ſooner

began now to diſtinguiſh himſelf as a General,

ſuited to both theſe Capacities, he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the modern Practice of allotting the Civil
Power to one Sett of Men, and the Military
to another, but was for having them united in

diffuſe as they; but was better heard than moſt
of them. His Manner was plain and conciſe,
ſtrong and pointed, full of Matter and good
Senſe, and always to the purpoſe. When he
was one Day in the Aſſembly obſerv'd to be
very penſive, and his Friends ask'd him the

who had a ſecret Jealouſy of him, was wont
to call him, <hi>The Pruning-book of his Periods.</hi>
This Brevity and Simplicity in his Diction,
was of the <hi>Spartan</hi> kind; and he had ſtill more
of the <hi>Spartan</hi> in his manner of Deportment.
He had ſuch a ſettled Compoſure in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
that he was never ſeen either to laugh
or cry. He was grave and auſtere even to
Moroſeneſs; inſomuch that they who were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to him, did not care to accoſt him. But this
Severity was more in his Appearance than in
his Temper: For he was naturally very eaſy
and converſable; humane and beneficent; and a
great Patron of the diſtreſs'd, even of thoſe
who had moſt oppos'd him. His Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
him for pleading in behalf of an ill
Man, He told them, <hi>The Innocent had no need
of an Advocate.</hi> In the Camp he went very
thinly clad, and generally barefoot; and he lived
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0761100600:326"/>
at home with his Family much in the ſame
coarſe hardy way. There is upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a remarkable Saying of his Wife, who was
noted for her Virtue and good Houſe-wifery;
and being viſited by an <hi>Ionian</hi> Woman of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
who ſhew'd her all her Jewels, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery,
and other rich Ornaments, <hi>For my
part,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>My only Ornament, is my
good Man</hi> Phocion, <hi>who has commanded the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<hi>now theſe twenty Years.</hi> He was not ſo
happy in his Son, who being inclined to Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Exceſs, he ſent him to <hi>Sparta</hi> to be put
into a ſtricter way of Education; and <hi>Demades</hi>
repoarch'd him with it publickly, as an Attempt
to introduce the <hi>Spartan</hi> Manners and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
He certainly had a very bad Opinion
of the Manners of his Country, and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have reform'd them; but he could not do
it otherwiſe than by his Example; and that was
of ſmall Force againſt ſo general a Corruption.
However as to his own particular, it gain'd
him an Awe and Attention from thoſe who
would not imitate him. It created ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of him, that he was choſen General up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Forty five ſeveral Expeditions, and always
in his Abſence: For tho' he did not decline
the Service when he was call'd to it, he never
put himſelf in the way of it. He was ſo far
from making a ſervile court to the People,
or ſoothing them in their Follies, that he took
all Occaſions of thwarting and oppoſing them
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0761100600:327"/>
and he would never give up a point which he
thought neceſſary for the Good or Safety of the
Publick. The Oracle having, upon a certain
Occaſion, told the <hi>Athenians,</hi> That there was
one Man in the City of a different Opinion
from the reſt, and Enquiry being made who this
ſhould be; <hi>I,</hi> ſaid Phocion, <hi>am the Man; I am
pleas'd with nothing that the Common People ſay, or
do.</hi> Another time, when he had deliver'd his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to them, and found that it was generally
approved, <hi>I wiſh,</hi> ſaid he, turning to his Friend,
<hi>That what I have propos'd, be not wrong.</hi> He
was ſo tenacious in what he thought moſt
adviſeable, that he would rather ſuffer himſelf
to be treated as a Coward, than enter into a
War, which did not appear to him to be juſt and
neceſſary. There is an Inſtance of this kind,
when being preſs'd to engage the Enemy at a
diſadvantage, <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>You cannot at this
time make me valiant, nor I you wiſe.</hi> The truth
is, he was naturally inclin'd to Peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
War no otherwiſe than as the means of
procuring it. He endeavour'd, by ſeveral pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Negotiations, to put an end to the War
with the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> and herein he ſeem'd to
act the Part of a Mediator: But the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Complaiſance, which he ſhew'd in this
Correſpondence with the Enemies of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
created a Suſpicion of his being too well
affected to them; and at laſt it coſt him his
Life. He certainly was upon good Terms with
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0761100600:328"/>
                  <hi>Philip, Alexander</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> who all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
eſteem'd and careſs'd him, and would
have loaded him with Preſents; but he could
not be prevail'd upon to accept any. Upon
this occaſion <hi>Antipater</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>I have
two Friends at</hi> Athens, Phocion <hi>and</hi> Demades;
<hi>of whom the former will not ſuffer me to gratify
him at all, and the other is never to be ſatisfy'd.
Phocion,</hi> upon the whole, was one of the wiſeſt
and beſt ſort of Men that <hi>Athens</hi> ever bred.
But the Steadineſs of his Virtue, and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of his Manners, would not let him drive
on with the Current of the Times he liv'd in;
and <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentions it as his Misfortune,
<hi>That he came to the Helm, when the Publick Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
was juſt upon ſinking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> found his Affairs advance ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Euboea,</hi> he thought fit to retreat, and march'd
back to <hi>Thrace,</hi> in order to diſtreſs the <hi>Athenians</hi>
in thoſe Parts, from whence they receiv'd a great
Part of their Proviſions. With this View, in
the laſt Year of the 109th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> he laid
Siege to <hi>Perinthus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieges</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</note>, and firmly attach'd to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> He
inveſted it with an Army of thirty thouſand
Men; and having rais'd his Works to a great
heighth, ſo as to command thoſe of the Enemy,
he made his Aſſault with all kinds of battering
Engines. The Inhabitants were no leſs active
and reſolute on their Part; ſo that when <hi>Philip</hi>
had made a Breach in the Wall, which he thought
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0761100600:329"/>
ſufficient to gain his Entrance into the Town, he
found they had run up another Wall within ſide;
by means whereof, together with the natural Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Place, which roſe up gradually in
the Form of a Theatre, they made a vigorous
Defence, and held out till they were reliev'd from
<hi>Byzantium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip,</hi> to cut off this Communication, divided
his Army, and march'd with one half of it to
form the Siege of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> leaving the other
to carry on that of <hi>Perinthus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>and</hi> Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> Theſe violent
Proceedings gave a general Alarm both in <hi>Greece</hi>
and <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Lieutenants of the Provinces
near the Coaſts, were order'd to aſſiſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
with what Forces they could ſpare. The
Iſlands of <hi>Chios, Cos</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> united in the
ſame Deſign; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> began now to
exert themſelves in earneſt. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour'd to awaken them out of their
Lethargy, and to convince them, that the firſt
Attack againſt <hi>Perinthus</hi> was an open Violation
of the Peace: And they ſo far gave Attention
to him, that <hi>Chares</hi> was ſent out with a Fleet.
But he was a bad Man, and of a mean Capacity;
and as ſuch, he was pitch'd upon by the Creatures
of <hi>Philip</hi> for this Service. He behav'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Expectations, and had ſo little Credit
with the Allies of <hi>Athens</hi> upon the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi>
that they did not care to admit him into their
Ports. But the People now being grown more
ſenſible of their Danger, thought it neceſſary to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0761100600:330"/>
appoint ſome other Commander, on whom they
could better depend; and accordingly <hi>Phocion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was order'd out with a freſh Supply of Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> had hitherto endeavour'd, by many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Pretences, to cover his Deſigns, and to
keep Meaſures with the <hi>Athenians:</hi> But when he
found they had taken the Alarm, and were arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo many others againſt him, he wrote them
an expoſtulatory Letter,<note place="margin">He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to juſtify his Proceedings</note> wherein he charg'd them
with the Infraction of their Treaties, and with
many other Injuries, which he pretended to have
receiv'd from them. It was full of Complaints,
Reproaches and Menaces, and was drawn in a
very maſterly manner, with ſo much Art and
Delicacy, with ſuch a Variety of Facts, and ſuch
plauſible Reaſoning upon them, and with ſuch a
Spirit of Majeſty throughout the Whole, that it
may be look'd upon as one of the fineſt Pieces
of Antiquity. It was calculated for the Uſe of
the Partizans at <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo as to furniſh them
with Materials for pleading his Cauſe in the
Aſſembly; and the Intent of it was, to try if it
were yet too late to divert the People from puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things to an Extremity. The Point that he
laid the greateſt Streſs upon, was the engaging
the <hi>Perſians</hi> againſt him; and this he imputed to
the <hi>Athenians.</hi> It does not clearly appear how
far they were concern'd in it: But it is certain,
that, in order to check the Growth of his Power.
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had prepar'd the People for an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance

as theſe, <hi>Philip</hi> thought himſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
warranted to remonſtrate in the manner
he did to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> He told them, <hi>That
by this Inſtance of their calling in the</hi> Perſians,
<hi>and that at a time when he was in peace with them,
they had ſhewn more Hatred and Rancour againſt
him, than in caſes of the moſt open and declared En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
between them; That they had acted in it
contrary to all the Rules of Prudence and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and to the conſtant Practice not only of their
Anceſtors, but of themſelves likewiſe.</hi> And to this
purpoſe, he reminded them, that they had ſome
time ſince paſs'd a formal Reſolution, to invite
him to act in conjunction with them and the
other <hi>Grecians,</hi> againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and as their common Enemy. His ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
theſe Appellations of <hi>Barbarians</hi> and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners

the <hi>Locri Ozolae,</hi> who border'd upon the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
and were accus'd of the ſame Act of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
which they had committed in breaking
up a piece of Ground belonging to the Temple
of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphi:</hi> And this Caſe was referr'd,
in the ſame manner as the former was, to the
<hi>Amphictyons,</hi> who, in order to form their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Matter in diſpute, went to take
a view upon the Place, but were ſo inſulted
and attack'd by the <hi>Locrians,</hi> that they were
forc'd to fly for it. Hereupon both Sides had
recourſe to Arms, and there was all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0761100600:336"/>
not carried on with the ſame Zeal as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
it was ended almoſt as ſoon as it began

found the War went on ſo heavily, and that

was laid for them, and agreed to the latter
of theſe Propoſals. Hereupon a formal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy

               <p>The News of it arriving at <hi>Athens</hi> in the

the City was fill'd with Terror and Amazement.
The next Morning the Aſſembly met, and all
the Generals and Orators aſſiſted at it: But
when it was expected, that ſome of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
ſhould riſe to offer their Advice upon the
preſent Exigency, every body ſat mute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
The Crier made Proclamation, and
demanded, according to the uſual Form, <hi>Who
of them was diſpos'd to ſpeak?</hi> No body yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
the ſame Queſtion was ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated;
but ſtill to no purpoſe. At length,<note place="margin">They are animated by <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes.</hi>
                  </note> in
this general dead Silence, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> roſe up,
and endeavour'd to diſpel their Fears, and to
animate them for their Defence. The moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Danger they apprehended from <hi>Philip,</hi>
was his late Alliance with the <hi>Thebans;</hi> and
this was the point that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> labour'd
chiefly to clear up to them, and to make
it appear, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> were not ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attach'd to him as they imagin'd. <hi>For
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0761100600:338"/>
if it were ſo,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we ſhould not now have
heard of his being at</hi> Elatêa, <hi>but in</hi> Attica. To
which he added, <hi>That however the</hi> Thebans <hi>might
before have been deluded by him, this laſt Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his had more fully open'd their Eyes. It is
true,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſome part of them he had gain'd by
Mony and Artifice; and he has drawn down his
Troops to keep them in heart, and to intimidate
the reſt, who are the greateſt Part, and who have
hitherto oppos'd him, and would ſtill continue to
do ſo, if they had any Proſpect of being ſupported.</hi>
Wherefore he propos'd, That all who were able
to bear Arms, ſhould march out of the City,
and make a general Rendezvous at <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> as
well to ſet an Example to the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi> for
aſſerting the common Liberty, as to ſhew the
<hi>Thebans</hi> in particular, that they were ready to
protect and aſſiſt them. And in regard to that
inveterate Enmity and Rancour, which had ſo
long ſubſiſted between <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> he
advis'd the People to ſuppreſs it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and not to revive the Memory of paſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
which, he told them, would only ſerve to
hinder, or retard that Union and good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence,
which were now become ſo neceſſary
for their mutual Preſervation. He further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
That Ambaſſadors ſhould be ſent to the
ſeveral States of <hi>Greece,</hi> to make it a common
Cauſe; but eſpecially, and in the firſt place to
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> as they were more immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and as they were the Barrier to <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0761100600:339"/>
The Aſſembly readily agreed to this Advice
of <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> and purſuant thereto, a Decree
in form was drawn up, with an additional Clauſe,
That a Fleet of two hundred Sail ſhould be
fitted out, to cruize near <hi>Thermopylae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being no time to be loſt in this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation

                  </note> Ambaſſadors were

them was <hi>Python,</hi> who was a <hi>Byzantine</hi> by Birth,
and had been made a free Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi>
but was now in <hi>Philip</hi>'s Intereſt. He was a
very able and forcible Speaker, and therefore
was upon this occaſion oppos'd to <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi>
The <hi>Macedonians</hi> were heard firſt, the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
being given to them as Friends and Allies.
They ſet out with large Encomiums upon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
and after a long Recital of the many Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Advantages the <hi>Thebans</hi> had receiv'd
from him, and the many Injuries and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
they had receiv'd from <hi>Athens,</hi> they
endeavour'd to excite their Gratitude on the
one hand, and to fire their Reſentment on the
other. They alſo tempted them with the Hopes
of Booty, which, they told them, they ſhould
find in great abundance in <hi>Attica,</hi> and that they
would at the ſame time prevent the ravaging
their own Country, and making it the Seat of
the War, which would be the neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their entering into an Alliance with
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0761100600:340"/>
                  <hi>Athens.</hi> Upon the whole, they propos'd to them
in the alternative, either that they ſhould join
with <hi>Philip</hi> in the Invaſion of <hi>Attica,</hi> or that
they ſhould ſit ſtill, and give him a free Paſſage
thorugh <hi>Boeotia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> by way of Reply, uſed the
ſame king of Reaſoning with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> as
he had done with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to convince
them of the Neceſſity of proceeding againſt
<hi>Philip</hi> as their common Enemy: For that
whatever Words or Pretences he made uſe of,
his Deſigns were too viſible from his Actions.
He inſtanc'd particularly in the manner of his
ſeizing upon <hi>Elatêa.</hi> He told them, <hi>That in
caſe he ſhould ſucceed ſo far as to conquer</hi> Attica,
Thebes <hi>would ſuffer in its Turn; That he would go
on from one City, and one Province to another, and
would never ſtop 'till he had made himſelf Maſter
of the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Thebans</hi> were not very inclinable to enter
into any Engagements on either ſide: They had
too lively a Senſe of the Miſeries they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone,
eſpecially whilſt the Wounds they had
receiv'd in the <hi>Phocian</hi> War were ſtill freſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. But <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> fired them to ſuch a
degree, that they were no longer Maſters of
themſelves. The Force of his Eloquence, upon
this Occaſion, is ſaid <hi>to have caſt a Miſt over their
Underſtanding, to have carried them away like a
Whirlwind, and to have work'd them up to a ſort
of Enthuſiaſm:</hi> Inſomuch that, laying aſide all
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0761100600:341"/>
Fear and Gratitude,<note place="margin">The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> enter into an Alliance with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>

they declar'd themſelves for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
with <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which animated <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> next to his
Zeal for the publick Safety, was his having to do
with a Man of <hi>Python</hi>'s Abilities; and he ſome
time after, took occaſion to value himſelf upon
the Victory he had obtained over him. <hi>I did
not give way,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to the boaſting</hi> Python, <hi>when
he would have bore me down with a Torrent of
Words.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> values himſelf upon his Succeſs.</note> He gloried more in the Succeſs of this
Negotiation, than of any other he had been
employ'd in, and ſpoke of it as his Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
in Politicks. It was certainly of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Importance to <hi>Athens</hi> at this time, when
<hi>Philip</hi> ſeem'd fully bent on her Deſtruction, and
when ſhe had no other immediate Proſpect of
Relief, but from the gaining the <hi>Thebans. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi>
therefore, to do himſelf Juſtice, put the
People in mind of the Danger they had eſcap'd.
He told them, <hi>It was he, who had diſperſed that
Cloud which hung over the City, and that, by this
Inſtance of his unwearied Diligence and Zeal for
the Publick, he had exceeded all that had been done
by the greateſt Orators of former Ages.</hi> He was
generally more modeſt than he appears to have
been in this Caſe: But it muſt be conſider'd,
that what he ſaid upon this Occaſion, was ſome
time after, in his Defence againſt <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> who,
by his artful and invidious inſinuations, had put
him under a Neceſſity of enumerating his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0761100600:342"/>
to the Common-wealth, and of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in the ſtrongeſt Light they would
bear.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> found himſelf thus diſappointed
of the <hi>Thebans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip's Artifices to avoid fighting.</note> he ſued again to the <hi>Athenians</hi>
for Peace: but they ſaw his Drift too plainly
to truſt him, and were too much exaſperated
to hearken to any Terms of Accommodation.
However, he reſolved to ſtand it out with them,
and both Sides prepared for Battle. But before
it came to Action, he try'd another Stratagem;
which was, by bribing the Oracle, to terrify them
with fatal Omens and predictions concerning the
Event of it. <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> to prevent theſe
Warnings making any deep Impreſſion, treated
them with the utmoſt Contempt; and it was
upon this Occaſion, that he charged the
Prieſteſs with <hi>Philippizing.</hi> He put the <hi>Thebans</hi>
in mind of their <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who, he told them, were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Reaſon and good Senſe, and would
not ſuffer themſelves to be carried away by ſuch
idle ſuperſtitious Fancies, which they look'd
upon only as a Cloak for Cowardice. The
<hi>Athenians</hi> were ſo eager for the War, that they
eaſily got the better of theſe frightful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions;
and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had, by his laſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0761100600:343"/>
Accordingly they took the Field,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
together near <hi>Cheronêa</hi> in <hi>Boeotia;</hi> where
<hi>Philip</hi> met them with thirty thouſand Foot,
and two thouſand Horſe. He was ſomewhat
ſuperior to them in Numbers, and more ſo in
the Goodneſs of his Officers. He gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the left Wing of his Army to his Son
<hi>Alexander,</hi> but, in regard to his Youth, he
placed the beſt of his Officers about him; and
the right Wing he took to himſelf. In the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Army, the <hi>Thebans</hi> were on the right,
and the <hi>Athenians</hi> on the left. At Sun-riſing
the two Armies join'd Battle, and behav'd with
ſuch equal Courage and Bravery, that it was
long before any Impreſſion was made on either
ſide; till at length <hi>Alexander,</hi> exerting himſelf in
an extraordinary manner, broke in upon the
<hi>Sacred Band</hi> of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and cut them to
Pieces; after which, the reſt of that Wing were
eaſily routed. <hi>Philip,</hi> who had to do with the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> forc'd them likewiſe to give way:
But they ſoon recover'd their Ground; and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles,</hi>

wrought a thorough Change in him; and he
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0761100600:345"/>
was ſo far from being offended at <hi>Demades,</hi> that
he immediately gave him his Liberty, and
ſhew'd him afterwards great Marks of Honour
and Friendſhip. He likewiſe releas'd all the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Captives, and without Ranſom; and
when they found him ſo generouſly diſpos'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, they made a Demand of their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
with every thing elſe that had been taken
from them; but to that <hi>Philip</hi> reply'd, <hi>Surely they
think I have not beat them.</hi> This Diſcharge of the
Priſoners was aſcrib'd in a great meaſure to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades,</hi>
who is ſaid to have new modell'd <hi>Philip,</hi>
and to have ſoften'd his Temper with the <hi>Attick

acknowledg'd upon another Occaſion, that
his frequent Converſe with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Orators,
had been of great uſe to him in correcting his
Morals. <hi>Juſtin</hi> repreſents his Carriage after the
Battle in a very different Light; as that he took
abundance of Pains to diſſemble his Joy; that
he affected great Modeſty and Compaſſion, and
was not ſeen to laugh; that he would have no
Sacrifice, no Crowns nor Perfumes; that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
all kind of Sports; and did nothing that
might make him appear to the Conquerors to be
elated, nor to the Conquer'd, to be inſolent.
But this Account ſeems to have been confounded
with others, which were given of him after his
being reform'd by <hi>Demades.</hi> It is certain, that

that either by the Sword, or by Baniſhment, he

                     <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ſtarves himſelf.</note> than
to ſurvive the Liberty of his Country: Which is
a ſufficient Proof, that his Intimacy with <hi>Philip,</hi>
which has before been mention'd, was with an
Intent to ſerve the Common-wealth; and that
his End was good, tho' he was miſtaken in the
Means of attaining it, and in the Man he had
to deal with. The Truth is, he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
enough in publick Affairs. His proper
Province was his School, wherein he ſucceeded
beyond any Man of his Time; and he got ſo much
Mony by it, that he was oblig'd to build a Gally,
and maintain it at his own Charge. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
condemns him for his unactive and recluſe way of
Life, and ſets him in a very pedantick Light:
That he ſat poring at home in his Study, when
every Body elſe was in Arms: That, inſtead of
ſharpening his Sword and his Spear, and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up his Helmet, he was adapting, ranging
and poliſhing his Words and Sentences; and
that he was three <hi>Olympiads</hi> in compoſing<note n="*" place="bottom">His Panegyrick.</note> one

have been terrified at the clattering of Weapons, or

ſuffering one Vowel to claſh with another, or to
pronounce a Word where the Syllables were uneven?</hi>
But notwithſtanding this Piece of Raillery, he
was generally reſpected and admir'd, not only as
a perfect Maſter in his Profeſſion, but as a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

yet as little as he was to be depended on, he had
his Partizans among the People, and among the

Merit of his own, he could the leſs bear it in
thoſe who had: This was the Grounds of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Charge againſt <hi>Iphicrates</hi> and <hi>Timotheus;</hi>
and the manner in which it was carried on, has
already been mention'd as a Reproach to the
Common-wealth. In ſhort, he was a bad Man,

But he was a wiſe and moderate Man, as well as
valiant and fortunate; he knew where to ſtop,
and how to enjoy the Fruits of his Conqueſts.
There is hardly an Inſtance of any other <hi>Grecian,</hi>
who, after ſuch Succeſs, went quietly to his Grave,
without expoſing himſelf further, ſo as to fall a
Sacrifice either to his own Ambition, or to the
Inſolence and Ingratitude of his Countrymen.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves a remarkable Difference between
the Atchievements of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and thoſe of his
Contemporaries: That in thoſe of <hi>Timotheus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus,
Pelopidas,</hi> and even of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who
was the Pattern that <hi>Timoleon</hi> copied after, there
was a certain Stiffneſs, Labour and Struggling,
which took off from the Merit and Luſtre of
them; but that thoſe of <hi>Timolcon</hi> were like the
Poetry of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Painting of <hi>Nicoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
which, beſides the Strength and Beauty,
that they had in common with others, were more
free and eaſy, more graceſul and more maſterly.
We can never too much admire and extol the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0761100600:353"/>
eaſy Progreſs that he made with an handful of
Men in <hi>Sicily,</hi> by driving out the Tyrants, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing
the numerous Fleets and Armies of the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and taking <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> one of the
ſtrongeſt Cities of the World, and which had ſo
long withſtood all the Power of <hi>Athens;</hi> tho' it
muſt be confeſs'd, that it was not ſo well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
nor ſo well defended now, as in the Time
of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War. But tho' his Actions
were ſo generally applauded, it happen'd once,
that two of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> who were popular
Speakers, brought a Charge againſt him for ſome
Part of his Conduct as General; and one of 'em
demanded, that he ſhould give Security for his
Appearance; which the People were highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at, as thinking that, in his Caſe, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Forms of Juſtice ought to be diſpenſed
with. But he would not ſuffer himſelf to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from a due Obſervance of the Laws,
which he had taken ſo much Pains to enforce
againſt others. However, when the Matter
came to be heard, he treated it as a Piece of
Calumny, and inſtead of going about to refute
it, he only thank'd the Gods, that they had
granted his Requeſt; for that he had liv'd to ſee
the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> now at Liberty to ſay whatever
they thought fit. He leſt them in full Poſſeſſion
of the Liberty both of ſpeaking and acting; and

from thence we may date the Downfal of the
Liberties of <hi>Greece.</hi> For tho' <hi>Philip</hi> did not

                  <hi>Philip,</hi> ſoon after this Accident, met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the ſame kind, which prov'd more fatal
to him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Daughter</hi> Cleopatra.</note> This happen'd upon the Marriage of
his Daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi> King of
<hi>Epirus,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Olympias. Philip,</hi> to
add to the Solemnity of the Nuptials, and to
do himſelf Honour upon his intended Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he had ſtill very much at Heart,
made a moſt magnificent Entertainment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
all the moſt conſiderable Men of <hi>Greece,</hi>
taking this Opportunity to teſtify his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for their having choſen him their General.
The ſeveral Cities, from whence they came,
were not wanting on their Part to compliment
him on the Occaſion, and to flatter his Vanity:
They vy'd with one another in ſending him
Crowns of Gold; and <hi>Athens</hi> was not leſs zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and devoted to him than the reſt. The
next Day after the Feaſt, there were publick
Shews to be exhibited, and <hi>Philip</hi> went in great
Pomp to aſſiſt at them, being dreſs'd in a white
Robe, and his Nobles and Guards attending
him in the form of a Proceſſion. There were
carry'd before him twelve Images of the Gods
of exquiſite ſine Workmanſhip; and a thirteenth
was added, which was more ſplendid than the reſt,
and was to repreſent himſelf as One among the
Number of the Deities. But in the Heighth
of the Solemnity, amidſt the joyful Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a numberleſs Croud of Spectators from
all Parts, and juſt as his Statue enter'd the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0761100600:357"/>
Theatre, the Ceremony was interrupted by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi>
a young <hi>Macedonian</hi> Nobleman. He had
ſome time before been groſly affrnoted by <hi>Attalus,</hi>
who, after he had made him drunk, carnally
abuſed him, and then proſtituted him to others.
<hi>Pauſanias</hi> made his Complaint to the King,
and demanded Juſtice: But <hi>Philip</hi> did not care
to hearken to an Accuſation againſt the Queen's
Uncle. The young Man renew'd his Suit, and
was ſo importunate for Redreſs, that at laſt
<hi>Philip,</hi> to pacify him, gave him a Commiſſion
of the firſt Rank in his Guards. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> did
not look upon this as a Satisfaction for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
he had receiv'd; and tho' he ſtifled his
Revenge for ſome time, he took the preſent
Occaſion of executing it in the moſt publick
manner upon the Perſon of the King. <hi>Philip</hi>
had order'd his Guards, both before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
to keep at a proper Diſtance from him,
ſo as to leave him room enough to appear more
conſpicuouſly to the People; and as he march'd
alone in that intermediate Space, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> made
up to him, drew his Dagger and ſtabb'd him,<note place="margin">Philip <hi>kill'd</hi> by Pauſanias.</note> 
and left him dead upon the Spot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pauſanias</hi> had Horſes ready for his Eſcape,
and had like to have ſucceeded in it; but one
of his Feet being hamper'd in a Vinc, he was
taken and cut to Pieces. <hi>Olympias</hi> is ſaid to have
provided the Horſes for this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Olympias <hi>acceſſary to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </note> and was
look'd upon not only as privy to the Murther,
but as the chief Promoter of it. Neither was
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0761100600:358"/>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf quite free from Suſpicion. But
his Mother was ſo far from concealing the Part
ſhe had in it, that ſhe affected to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and was only afraid leſt the Proofs ſhould
not appear ſtrong enough againſt her. The very
Night ſhe went to aſſiſt at the King's Funeral,
ſhe caus'd a Crown of Gold to be put upon the
Head of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> whilſt he was hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Croſs. Some Days after ſhe buried him,
and erected a Tomb for him, and appointed an
Anniverſary-day to be kept in Honour of his
Memory. She likewiſe conſecrated the Dagger
with which he committed the Fact. Then ſhe
turn'd her Rage againſt <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for whom
ſhe had been divorced; and having murther'd
her Infant Child at her Breaſt, caus'd her to
be hang'd. From theſe and ſeveral other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which might be given of her Cruelty
and Revenge, it may eaſily be believ'd, that
ſhe was more than conſenting to the Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the King, and that ſhe made uſe of the
Reſentment of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> to ſatisfy her own.</p>
               <p>The News of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death was a joyful
Surpriſe in <hi>Greece,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Athens,</hi>
where the People crown'd themſelves with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the News of</hi> Philip'<hi>s Death was receiv'd at</hi> Athens.</note> and decreed a Crown to <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> They
ſacrific'd to the Gods for their Deliverance, and
ſung Songs of Triumph, as if <hi>Philip</hi> had been
ſlain by them in Battle. But this Exceſs of
Joy did ill become them: It was look'd upon
as an ungenerous and unmanly Inſult upon the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0761100600:359"/>
Aſhes of a murther'd Prince, and of one whom
they juſt before had rever'd, and crouch'd to
in the moſt abject manner. Theſe immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Tranſports were rais'd in them by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi>
who having the firſt Intelligence of
<hi>Philip</hi>'s Death, went into the Aſſembly unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
gay and chearful, with a Chaplet on his
Head, and in a rich Habit, tho' it were then
but the ſeventh Day after the Death of his
Daughter. From this Circumſtance <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
at the ſame time that he condemns the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the <hi>Athenians</hi> in general upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
takes an Handle to juſtify <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
and extols him as a Patriot, for not ſuffering
his Domeſtick Afflictions to interfere with the
Good-fortune of the Common-wealth. But he
certainly might have acted the Part of a good
Citizen with more Decency and Compoſure,
and more to the Honour of himſelf and his
Country.</p>
               <p>This Accident happen'd to <hi>Philip</hi> in the
forty ſeventh Year of his Age,<note place="margin">A. M. 3668. Olymp. 111. 1.</note> and the twenty
fifth of his Reign; during which time he was
conſtantly in Action, 'till by Degrees he chang'd
the whole Face of Affairs, both in <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Macedonia.</hi> The Steps by which he advanc'd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
                  </note> 
were firm and ſure, but withal ſo ſlow and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible,
that he ſeem'd to have no great
Share of Ambition; and yet in reality Nobody
had more; but Nobody had it ſo much under
Command, nor knew ſo well how to diſguiſe it.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0761100600:360"/>
It was varniſh'd over, as as his Actions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
were, with falſe Colours; it had the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Juſtice and Humanity, and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to Mankind, in protecting the Innocent,
redreſſing the Injur'd, and extirpating Tyranny:
But his Acts of this kind were only plauſible
Methods of advancing his own Grandeur and
Authority, and of ſubverting the Publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
under a Pretence of defending it.</p>
               <p>He was admirably well qualified for the part
he acted. For he had an equal Mixture of
Fire and Phlegm, which ſerv'd to correct
each other: The firſt put him upon form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Deſigns, and the latter conducted
him in the Execution of them; ſo that his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
was owing chiefly to this due Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which made him cautious without Fear,
and bold without Raſhneſs. When he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his point, he kept it always in view, and
conceal'd it from every body elſe. For he
truſted no body further than was neceſſary; he
had Favourites, but no Confidents. He was his
own Miniſter, his own General, and his own
Treaſurer; and as he had all the Capacity, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance
and Activity, which theſe ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
requir'd, he was intirely Maſter of his own
Schemes, and of the Execution of them. Which
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> takes notice of, as a particular Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that he had over the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by being
ſo ſecret in his Deliberations, and ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd
in his Actions. And the Caſe was much
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0761100600:361"/>
the ſame in the other Republicks, where Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the moſt ſecret Importance were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs'd
and debated in their popular Aſſemblies,
the Reſolutions taken upon thoſe Debates were
made publick, and the Hands of thoſe who
were to executed them, were tied up; and by
theſe means they generally loſt their Effect, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
with regard to <hi>Philip,</hi> who knew ſo
well the Conſtitution of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Uſe
that was to be made of ſuch a Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
               <p>He
look'd upon all means of attaining his
ends to be juſtifiable; and he had Expedients
of all kinds, and for all Occaſions. He knew
all the different ways that were to lead him to
his Mark; but he generally choſe that which was
moſt dark and intricate, and out of the common
Road. He lov'd Feints and Stratagems for the
Pleaſure of deceiving; and he valued himſelf
leſs upon the Succeſs of a Battle, than of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation:
For which reaſon he ſeldom employ'd
Force, 'till his Artifices fail'd him. And yet
when he found himſelf obliged to have recourſe
to Arms, no body behaved with more Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Intrepidity, nor with better Conduct.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> therefore bears too hard upon him,
when ſpeaking of him by way of compariſon
with <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> He ſays, He had none of
the principal Virtues of that Great Man, and,
among his other Defects, mentions his want of
Courage. But there does not appear to be the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0761100600:362"/>
leaſt Foundation for this Charge; and it has
been refuted by his greateſt Enemy <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
who deſcribes him with his Eye out, his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-bone
broke, his Hand and his Leg maim'd;
and then adds, That he had ſeen this <hi>Philip</hi>
thus wounded from Head to Foot, ſtill ready
to throw himſelf into the midſt of Dangers,
and to ſacrifice the reſt of his Body in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Purſuit of Glory.</p>
               <p>He infuſed the ſame Spirit into his Soldiers,
who were ſo animated by his Example, and
ſo inured to Action, that he could always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on them. He had alſo a way of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Affections: He would call them his
Comrades, and treat them otherwiſe with great
Familiarity; and he did it in ſuch a manner,
as neither to leſſen his Authority, nor relax the
Diſcipline. They were grown ſo hardy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
under him, that the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Troops
were reckon'd at this time almoſt as much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were to
the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Theſe were the Men whom <hi>Clytus</hi>
afterwards reproach'd <hi>Alexander</hi> with, when he
told him, <hi>It was his Father's Troops, by which
he had conquer'd. Alexander</hi> was too ſenſible of
the truth of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and it coſt the old Man his
Life.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Philip</hi> had been equal in other reſpects to
what he was in the Field, he had made a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Figure: But his Tricks and Subterfuges
and deep Diſſimulation, his groſs Bribery, Trea
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0761100600:363"/>
chery and Breach of Faith, which make up the
main of his Character, have caſt ſuch a Shade
over his real good Qualities, that they are hardly
to be diſtinguiſh'd, and have given occaſion to
call even his military Virtues in queſtion. But
in that reſpect, he was undoubtedly ſuperior to
all the Captains of his time: And he had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
great Talents. He had a fine Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with a ſtrong and clear Judgment; great
Prudence and Foreſight; great Variety of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and other acquir'd Knowledge. He ſpoke
and wrote with great Eaſe, Propriety and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but with too much Art and Subtilty: For
there was Deſign and Inſincerity in every thing
he ſaid, whether he were in jeſt, or in earneſt.
He always promis'd more than he intended to
perform; and he had as little regard to his Oath,
as to his Promiſe. To this purpoſe he had a
Saying, <hi>That Children were to be cheated with
Play-things, and Men with Oaths.</hi> And yet
notwithſtanding this impious Maxim of his, he
made a great Shew of Religion, and it was that
which gain'd him his firſt footing in <hi>Greece</hi>
in the <hi>Phocian</hi> War. Among his other Arts
of Hypocriſy, by which he impos'd upon the
World, we may reckon that of his being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
every Morning by a Servant, to put
him in mind of his Mortality. His Friendſhips
were govern'd wholly by his Intereſt: They
were only mercenary Engagements, that he had
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0761100600:364"/>
enter'd into with bad Men, and for bad Ends
and when they had ſerv'd his Purpoſe, he had done
with them. This was the Caſe of moſt of his
Agents who ſold their Country to him; he paid
them their Price, and then diſcarded them;
for he lov'd the Treaſon, but not the Traytor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Of which there was a memorable Inſtance in
his Treatment of the two Magiſtrates, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
<hi>Olynthus</hi> to him. When they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
univerſally ſcouted and contemn'd for that
Act of Treachery, and even by the common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in his own Army, they applied to him for
Protection and Redreſs; but he gave them a very
ſhort Anſwer, and a very cutting one; <hi>O!</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>you muſt not mind what ſuch blunt Fellows
ſay, who call every thing by its own Name.</hi> He
had a particular Faculty of ſetting two Friends
at variance, and by that means of getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Confidence. And this was his main
Artifice in the carrying on his Deſigns againſt
<hi>Greece,</hi> by ſowing Jealouſies, fomenting Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and playing one State againſt another; and
when he had, by theſe Methods, broke into
their Alliances, and ſeparated their Intereſts, the
remaining Part was not difficult. His hardeſt
Task was with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with whom he was
continually either fighting, or treating: And
tho' they had, 'till his time, the Reputation of
a more reſined Wit than their Neighbours, and
of more Sagacity, Penetration and Attention
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0761100600:365"/>
to their Intereſts; yet he found means to amuſe
and confound them, to delude and inſatuate
them, to corrupt and divide them.</p>
               <p>He was not ſo taken up in the purſuit of
his Ambition, but that he found time for his
Pleaſures, wherein he indulg'd himſelf in a very
diſſolute and licentious manner; and in this part
of his Life, he acted openly, and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.
He lov'd Riot and Drunkenneſs, and
Intemperance of all kinds, and encourag'd them
ſo much in others, that he was ſurrounded with
a Set of lewd Paraſites and Debauchees, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Buffoons and Pantomimes, who engroſs'd
all his Favours, and ſhar'd all his Bounty; but
amidſt theſe Exceſſes, he had, or affected to
have, ſome Senſe of Shame; ſo that when he
had committed any Acts of Violence or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
he would eaſily bear Reproof, and often
repair the Injury. There was a Woman who
put her ſelf in his way, after he had been ſitting
long at Table, and demanded juſtice of him.
He heard her Caſe, and determin'd againſt
her. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I will appeal. What?
From your King?</hi> ſaid <hi>Philip. And who is it you
would appeal to? To</hi> Philip, <hi>when he is ſober,</hi>
ſhe replied. Whereupon he examin'd the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſair
over again, and finding he had given a
wrong Judgment, made a new one in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Another Woman had long ſolicited an
Audience of him upon a like Occaſion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0761100600:366"/>
put off from time to time, with a pretence
that he was not at leiſure, ſhe could bear no
longer, but ſaid to him, <hi>If you have not time
to do me Juſtice, ceaſe to be King.</hi> He was ſo
far from reſenting her manner of reproaching
him, that he immediately redreſs'd her Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and from thenceforwards he became more
exact in giving Audience to his Subjects. There
was another Inſtance of a good ſort of Man,
whom he was advis'd to baniſh, for having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ill of him; <hi>No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philip, Let me conſider
firſt, whether I have not given him Occaſion for
it.</hi> And being afterwards inform'd, that he had
never given him any Mark of his Favour, and
that he was in bad Circumſtances, he reliev'd
him. When the Man had taſted of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he chang'd his Note, and ſpoke as much
in his Praiſe: which gave occaſion to <hi>Philip</hi> to
make another Reflection, <hi>That Kings have it
in their own power to be belov'd or hated.</hi> He
has given ſeveral other Proofs of his <hi>ſwallowing
Injuries,</hi> as <hi>Longinus</hi> calls it; and ſome remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
of his Actions.</p>
               <p>Thus by a Mixture of ſome good Qualities,
with a great many bad ones, he accompliſh'd
his Ends, ſo far at leaſt, that he had throughly
open'd the Way to the Deſtruction of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and laid the Foundation of all his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0761100600:367"/>
Son's Glory. And if the Actions of each of them
be duly weigh'd, it will be found, that <hi>Philip</hi>'s
Part was the more difficult of the two. For it
was certainly eaſier to conquer <hi>Aſia</hi> with the
Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> than to break the
Power of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who had ſo often beat
the <hi>Aſiaticks.</hi> Wherefore we may venture to
pronounce, That tho' <hi>Alexander</hi> was the greater
Conqueror, <hi>Philip</hi> was the greater Man. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were both form'd for the Task they
undertook. If <hi>Philip</hi> had liv'd to paſs over into
<hi>Aſia,</hi> his artful and deliberate Valour would
not, in all Likelihood, have had ſo good
an Effect there, as the Heroick Ardour and
Impetuoſity of his Son, which bore down
every thing that oppos'd him, and which
carried him on with ſuch Rapidity through
the whole Body of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire.
But however <hi>Philip</hi> might have ſucceeded in
that Expedition, it ſeems pretty extraordinary,
that he ſhould think of entring upon it,
before he had made a more intire Conqueſt
of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was certainly his original
Plan, and the Point, in which all his other
Views center'd: And his Succeſs at <hi>Cheronêa</hi>
had given him the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aireſt Proſpect he ever
had, of ſubduing the whole Country. It had
put the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Thebans</hi> ſo far in
his Power, that they were expecting every
Hour to have his Yoke impos'd on them.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0761100600:368"/>
As to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> tho' they had avoided en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into the Quarrel, it is hardly to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
they would tamely have ſubmitted to him

                  </gap>
But in Anſwer to it, their King <hi>Archidamus</hi> the
Son of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſent him word, <hi>That if he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
his Shadow, he would find it no bigger after
his Victory, than it was before.</hi> The Anſwer they
ſent him to another Letter of the ſame kind,
was, <hi>Dionyſius to Corinth.</hi> However, they were
not in a Condition ſingly to make Head againſt
him; and the other ſubordinate States were ſo
weak and diſunited, and withal ſo indolent and
remiſs, that there was no immediate Appearance
of forming any conſiderable League againſt
him. But whether he thought the <hi>Grecians</hi> were
ſtill too formidable for him, to act in open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of them; and that his Shew of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Humanity, and his Arts of Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were eaſier and ſafer Methods of gaining
further Ground upon them; or whether he
really contented himſelf with the having hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them, and with the Honour of preſiding
in their Great Council, and of leading them
forth to Battle under the Title of their General,
it is certain, that he did not purſue his firſt
Scheme of Conqueſt againſt them, nor make
uſe of the Advantages, that he had then in his
Hands. He had ſtill leſt them in a Condition
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0761100600:369"/>
to recover their former Liberty, if they had
had any Remains of their former Spirit: But
that was ſo broken and decay'd, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an eaſy Prey to his Succeſſors.</p>
