            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Edications, <hi>Madam,</hi> ought in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to be addreſt to the moſt powerful, and in Juſtice to the moſt deſerving. Theſe I think I have united by applying to You in this Manner, who have gain'd the former of theſe Advantages by means of the latter. Accompliſhments like Your's give the moſt abſolute Authority of any: I mean that over the Judgments, as well as Hearts of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I intended here, <hi>Madam,</hi> after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other well-meaning Dedicators, to have given ſome Sketches of Your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Not ſo much from the Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Art in deſcribing, as of the peculiar Diligence I have uſed in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. An indifferent Painter may trace ſome Features of his Sov'reign's Face, whoſe Loyalty has render'd him accurate in ſtudying the Original—Beſides, 'Twere
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0926502600:3"/>
hard a Lady of Your Perfections ſhou'd be the only one exempted from the Pleaſure of being acquainted with 'em. 'Tis true, You have a quick Eye, and penetrating Judgment in diſtinguiſhing both natural, and moral Beauties: But You muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably remain a Stranger to the greateſt, were it not for the Aſſiſtance of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Utenſils, a Poet and a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſs.</p>
            <p>'Twere dangerous indeed You might ſuffer by any Repreſentation I am capable of. But 'twas not Incapacity alone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd me. There is ſomething in Your Character vaſtly diſadvantageous to any that attempts it. To proclaim You poſſeſs'd of every imaginable good Quality, wou'd be ſaying it was Day, when the Sun ſhines in its Meridian. As for Your Faults, (if You have any,) they indeed are far enough from being liable to the former Exception: but the extreme Difficulty I ſhou'd have found in ſelecting a few minute ones, (And ſome I muſt have ſelected, if poſſible, as the Shades of my <hi>Piece</hi>;) together with the ſmall Share of Credit I ſhou'd have gain'd in the World, diſ-hearten'd me. Such indeed were my only Objections. Unleſs I may adjoin this, that to Strangers your real and genuine Character muſt have
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0926502600:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paſs'd for Flattery. I ſay to Strangers, for, where you are known, You muſt be acknowledg'd incapable of it: As the Sun's Brightneſs can be ſet off by no Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Hence, in ſhort, I laid aſide all thoughts of a Portraiture. Thoſe, that wou'd love You as You deſerve, muſt know You; as neceſſarily, as thoſe, who know You, muſt conſequently love You.</p>
            <p>As to the Poetry, I beg Leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that 'tis the Product of a young Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, little exercis'd in Verſification. And the Muſes, you know, <hi>Madam,</hi> are not like a great many of their Sex, that have the moſt Eſteem for thoſe, who neglect them; tho' they have had ſometimes, in Appearance. <hi>Horace,</hi> and <hi>Swift</hi> (whom to you I wou'd chuſe to mention) have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them whole Mornings at their <hi>Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi> that they might conduct them into the World, in a more agreeable Undreſs. But my Negligences, <hi>Madam,</hi> are of ſuch a Nature, that I muſt beg you'd impute them to Diſuſe and Inexperience. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by this Confeſſion, I may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly put you in Mind of a Lady, who, having thrum'd over a Spinnet for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Space, without the leaſt ſhew of Harmony, took much pains to prove ſhe had never play'd before. 'Tis with an
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0926502600:5"/>
Author much the ſame as with a Sports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>Hippolitus</hi> may excuſe his Ill-ſucceſs to himſelf, and, perhaps juſtly alledge ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral alleviating Circumſtances; But in vain may he attempt his vindication to the World. That has been ſo frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by theſe Apologies, that it has made it a Rule to fix the Fault upon the Marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>I indeed ever deſpair'd of affording much entertainment this way to a Lady of your refin'd Taſte: And I'm poſitive, that Indolence, has with me prov'd, and always will do, more than a Ballance to any <hi>other</hi> Ambition. This is my only Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that, as one almoſt inſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms to a taſte one very much admires, I can't but think theſe Trifles won't prove abſolutely diſagreeable to Your's.</p>
            <p>You'll perhaps find other Names in theſe Pages, than that, which includes all that's agreeable, and is indeed the moſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive word that is; I mean your own. But as there is ſome thing mean in an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Praiſes of another, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Apprehenſion of being rival'd, which I take to be it's original; I'm ſecure of giving You no uneaſineſs. Eſpecially, ſince a Lady of Your Merit may give all others infinitely more than their due, without the leaſt Shadow of Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0926502600:6"/>
I ask Pardon for the Pedantry of Latin Mottoes and Quotations: But You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſpenſe with the loſs of them, whether You conſider them, merely as a Compliance with cuſtom, or as certain ſcraps of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, to indemnify the Poet with thoſe Critic's, who approve only what's ancient. As there are ſome, who fix a tutelary Piece of Iron on their Threſholds, to elude the Fury of Ill-deſigning <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to the happineſs of being poſſeſs'd of Merit, is to ſhew one's Approbation of thoſe who are; And this is really no ſmall addition to a Man's Character. So that, ſhou'd theſe Papers appear ever ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, I ſhall value them on <hi>one</hi> Account; And ſhou'd their Fame prove equal to Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s, I ſhou'd value them on none ſo much as <hi>that</hi>; which is, that they enable me to declare openly how much I am,</p>
