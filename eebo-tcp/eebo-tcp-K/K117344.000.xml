            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ground which is deſcribed in the following Sheets, has been for ſome centuries paſſed over by the incurious Traveller; and has had the hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of being conſtantly execrated for its dulneſs. To retort the charge, and clear it from the calumny, is my preſent buſineſs. To ſhew that the road itſelf, or its vicinity, is replete with either antient hiſtoric facts, or with matter worthy of preſent attention; is an affair of no great difficulty. Poſſibly my readers may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the opinion, that the tract is not abſolutely devoid of entertainment, and that the blame reſts on themſelves, not the country.</p>
            <p>WHATSOEVER entertainment they may meet with, let them join with me in thanks to the following contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butors. Firſtly and chiefly, to the Reveread Mr. COLE

               <head>THE JOURNEY TO LONDON.</head>
               <p>IN MARCH 1780, I began my annual journey to <hi>London.</hi> At <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſome improvements had taken place ſince my laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the city. A very commodious building has been erected in the <hi>Yatchfield,</hi> near the <hi>Watergate</hi> ſtreet, for the ſale of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> linen at the two fairs. It ſurrounds a large ſquare area; on each ſide of which are piazzas, with numbers of ſhops well adapted for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>IN digging the foundation for certain houſes near the ſtreet, were diſcovered ſome <hi>Roman</hi> buildings, and a large <hi>Hypocauſt</hi> with its ſeveral conveniences; and ſome other antiquities, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a beautiful altar <note n="*" place="bottom">Engraven in <hi>Moſes Griffith</hi>'s Supplemental Plates to the Tours in <hi>Wales,</hi> tab. X.</note>, dedicated <hi>Fortunae Reduci</hi> et <hi>Aeſculapio.</hi> Much of its inſcription is defaced; but the rudder, cornucopia, rod, ſerpent, and various ſacrificial inſtruments, are in good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0369200900:7"/>
ON leaving the city, I paſſed under the fine arch of the Eaſt Gate: a work owing to the munificence of Lord <hi>Groſvenor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boughton,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">BOUGHTON.</note> a ſuburb in the pariſh of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined from this part of the city, had before the diſſolution an hoſpital <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Tanner,</hi> 65.</note> for poor lepers, as early as the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> II. From an eminence, the retreat of the unfortunate brave, is a view of very uncommon beauty; of two fine reaches of the <hi>Dee,</hi> bounded on one part by meadows and hanging woods; on the other terminated by part of the city, the antient bridge, and over it a diſtant view of the <hi>Cambrian hills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ADJOINING to that part of <hi>Boughton</hi> which is within the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the city, is the townſhip of <hi>Boughton,</hi> in the county of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> the inhabitants of which appear at the court of the dean and chapter of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and pay there a chief rent: but uſually clame and diſpoſe of the waſtes.</p>
               <p>NEAR the two miles ſtone I croſſed the canal to <hi>Chriſtleton,</hi> a pretty village, ſeated, as uſual with thoſe of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> on the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone rock. <hi>Criſtetone,</hi> as it is called in the <hi>Doomſday</hi> book, was held before the Conqueſt by Earl <hi>Edwin.</hi> At that event, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, it had a chapel, or very ſoon after. This manor had been beſtowed by <hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> on <hi>Robert Fitz Hugh,</hi> one of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who gave the chapel of <hi>Criſtentune,</hi> with the land belonging to it, and the land of a certain peaſant, with the peaſant himſelf, to the abbey of <hi>Cheſter</hi>

                     <hi>Dugdale</hi> Mon. i. 201.</note>. His great great grand-daughter <hi>Iſabel,</hi> wife of Sir <hi>Philip Burnet,</hi> joined with her huſband in ſuing the abbey for this, and ſome other contiguous manors. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the monks might have taken an advantage of a fit of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0369200900:8"/>
remorſe for ſome crime, or the weakneſs of an illneſs, to obtain this gift from her anceſtor. They thought fit to compromiſe the matter with her; and on payment of two hundred pounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in 1280, the ninth of <hi>Edward</hi> I. a confirmation of the grant: and at the ſame time full liberty was given to the abbot to make a reſervoir of water, and to convey it to the abbey.</p>
               <p>IN the year 1282, <note place="margin">FREE WARREN.</note> 
                  <hi>William de Birmingham</hi> had <hi>free warren</hi> given him of all his demeſne lands in this village; but it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended he was only an inferior lord to the paramount privileges of the abbey. In the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, every man was allowed to kill game on his own eſtate, but on the Conqueſt, the king veſted the property of all the game in himſelf, ſo that no one could ſport, even on his own land, under moſt cruel penalties, without permiſſion from the king, by grant of a chaſe or <hi>free warren.</hi> By this, the grantee had an excluſive power of killing game on his own eſtate, but it was on condition that he prevented every one elſe; ſo that, as our learned commentator <note n="*" place="bottom">Judge BLACKSTONE.</note> obſerves, this ſeeming favor was intended for the preſervation of the beaſts and fowls of <hi>warren;</hi> which were roes, hares, and rabbits, partridge, rails, and quails, woodcocks and pheaſants, mallards and herons, for the ſport of our ſavage monarchs. This liberty, which they allowed to a few individuals, being deſigned merely to prevent a general deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtleton</hi> paſſed from the <hi>Birminghams,</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> II.'s time; to Sir <hi>Hugh Brower:</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> loſt it by his attachment to the houſe of <hi>York;</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the IVth, in the fourth year of his reign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it on <hi>John Manwaring,</hi> of <hi>Over Peover,</hi> an attendant on his

ſon, afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> V <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> 333.</note>. <hi>Manwaring</hi> having no lawful iſſue, beſtowed this place on Sir <hi>Thomas le Groſvenor,</hi> lord of <hi>Hulme;</hi> but it paſſed immediately from him to <hi>John de Macclesfield,</hi> in the 10th of <hi>Henry</hi> V. One of his deſcendants alienated it, in 1442, or the 21ſt of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. to <hi>Humphrey</hi> (afterward Duke) of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham. Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> ſon to <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſold it to Sir <hi>William Sneyde,</hi> of <hi>Keel;</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Sneyde,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Harpur,</hi> of <hi>Swerſton,</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire;</hi> one of whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants ſold it to <hi>Thomas Brock,</hi> Eſquire, the preſent lord of the manor. The living is a rectory, in the diſpoſal of Sir <hi>Roger Moſtyn:</hi> the church dedicated to St. <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM hence I took the horſe-road acroſs <hi>Brownheath,</hi> by <hi>Hoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenball,</hi> formerly the ſeat of a family of the ſame name. The riſing country to the left of this road appears to great advantage, oppoſing to the traveller a fair front, beautifully clumped with, ſelf-planted groves.</p>
               <p>PASSED over a brook, and reached the ſmall town of <hi>Tarvin,</hi> which ſtill retains nearly its <hi>Britiſh</hi> name <hi>Terfŷn,</hi> or the <hi>Boundary,</hi> and is ſo to the foreſt of <hi>Delamere.</hi> In Doomſday book, it is ſtiled <hi>Terve:</hi> the biſhop at that time held it. It then contained ſix taxable hides of land. The biſhop kept on it ſix cowmen, three radmen, ſeven villeyns, ſeven boors, and ſix ploughlands. The firſt were to keep his cattle; the ſecond to attend his perſon in his travels, or to go whereſoever he pleaſed to ſend them; the third, by their tenure, to cultivate his lands; and the fourth, to ſupply his table with poultry, eggs, and other ſmall matters. The <hi>ploughland,</hi> or <hi>caruca,</hi> was as much as one plough could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0369200900:10"/>
work in the year. This ſhews the eſtabliſhment of a manor in thoſe early times; which I mention now to prevent repetition.</p>
               <p>IN <hi>Henry</hi> VI.'s time, the village and manor were eſtimated at £23 a year, and were held by <hi>Reginald,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> in the ſame manner as they were held by his predeceſſors, under the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> as earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> They continued poſſeſſed by them till the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when they were alienated to Sir <hi>John Savage,</hi> who procured for the town the privilege of a market. The church is a rectory, and ſtill continues part of the ſee of <hi>Lichfield;</hi> being a prebendary, originally founded about the year 1226, by <hi>Alexander de Stavenby,</hi> biſhop of that dioceſe. It is valued at £26. 13<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> the higheſt endowment of any prebend in that cathedral. It is called the prebend of <hi>Tarvin,</hi> which preſents to the living.</p>
               <p>THE ſame prelate alſo beſtowed this church on the vice-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendal church of <hi>Burton,</hi> in <hi>Wiral</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Anglia Sacra, i. 446.</note>; and formed out of its reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues an hoſpital for ſhipwrecked perſons. This hoſpital was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably at <hi>Burton, Tarvin</hi> being too remote from the ſea for ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane a deſign.</p>
               <p>AGAINST the church-wall is a monument, in memory of Mr. <hi>John Thomaſine,</hi> thirty-ſix years maſter of the grammar-ſchool. The epitaph deſervedly celebrates the performances of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite penman, as <q>highly excelling in all the varieties of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wonderfully ſo in the <hi>Greek</hi> characters. Specimens of his ingenuity are treaſured up, not only in the cabinets of the curious, but in public libraries throughout the kingdom. He had the honour to tranſcribe, for her Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0369200900:11"/>
the <hi>Icon Baſilike</hi> of her royal grandfather. Invaluable copies alſo of <hi>Pindar, Anacreon, Theocritus, Epictetus, Hippocrates</hi>'s <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> and that finiſhed piece the <hi>Shield of Achilles,</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Homer,</hi> are among the productions of his celebrated pen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As his incomparable performances acquired him the eſteem and patronage of the great and learned; ſo his affability and humanity gained him the good-will of all his acquaintance; and the deceaſe of ſo much private worth is regretted as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic loſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Tarvin</hi> I travel on the great road, and at about two miles diſtance, leave on the right <hi>Stapleford,</hi> which retains the name it had at the Conqueſt, when it was held by <hi>Radulpus Venator</hi> from <hi>Hugh Lupus.</hi> After a long interval, it fell to the <hi>Breretons.</hi> In 1378, or the ſecond of <hi>Richard</hi> II. it was held by Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> of the king, as earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> From that family it paſſed to the <hi>Bruyns,</hi> and was purchaſed by the late <hi>Randle Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>Two miles farther, on the left, ſtood <hi>Utkinton Hall:</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, with <hi>Kingſley,</hi> and the baileywick of the foreſt of <hi>Delamere,</hi> was given by <hi>Randle Meſchines,</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to <hi>Randle de Kingſley;</hi> whoſe great grand-daughter <hi>Joan,</hi> about the year 1233, conveyed it to the <hi>Dones. Richard Done</hi> was poſſeſſed of it in 1311, the ſixth of <hi>Edward</hi> II. He held it by a quarter part of a knight's fee, and the maſter foreſterſhip of <hi>Mere (Delamere)</hi> and <hi>Mottram,</hi> by himſelf, and a horſeman and eight footmen under him, to keep that foreſt, then valued at £10. 10<hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>UPON the failure of iſſue male of Sir <hi>John Done,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the laſt century, the manor of <hi>Utkinton</hi> came to his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0369200900:12"/>
daughters, and has been ſince held by them, or perſons claming under them. <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſecond daughter, married, in 1636, <hi>John,</hi> ſecond ſon of Sir <hi>Randle Crew,</hi> of <hi>Crew;</hi> and <hi>Elinor,</hi> the younger, to <hi>Ralph Arderne,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Dones</hi> of <hi>Flaxyard,</hi> in this neighbourhood, were another conſiderable family, at conſtant feud with the former, till the houſes were united by the nuptials of the heir of <hi>Flaxyard</hi> with the heireſs of <hi>Utkinton.</hi> But at this time, both thoſe antient ſeats are demoliſhed, or turned into farm-houſes.</p>
               <p>FROM hence I ſoon reached <hi>Torporley,</hi> a ſmall town, ſeated on a gentle deſcent. It had once been a borough town, of which <hi>Richard Francis</hi> was mayor in the twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> I. In the tenth of the ſame reign, <hi>Hugh de Tarpoley</hi> had licence to hold a market here every <hi>Tueſday,</hi> and a fair on the vigil, the feaſt-day, and the day after the exaltation of the <hi>Holy Croſs;</hi> but he alienated this privilege, with his property, to <hi>Reginald de Grey,</hi> chief juſtice of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the eighth of <hi>Richard</hi> II. this manor was divided into two moieties; one of which was held by <hi>John Done,</hi> the other by <hi>Reginald Grey,</hi> of the family of Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> of <hi>Ruthin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE manor and rectory of <hi>Torporley</hi> are now divided into ſix ſhares: four belong to the <hi>Arderns;</hi> one to the dean and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and another to <hi>Philip Egerton,</hi> Eſquire, of <hi>Oulton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE living is a rectory in the gift of <hi>John Ardern,</hi> Eſquire. The church is dedicated to St. <hi>Helen,</hi> the Empreſs of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Coel,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> prince, a popular ſaint among us, if we may judge from the number of churches under her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That in queſtion is of no great antiquity, in reſpect to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0369200900:13"/>
building; nor yet of beauty. Within is much waſte of good marble, in monumental vanity.</p>
               <p>THE beſt, are two monuments in the chancel, ſeemingly copied from half-length portraits, included in carved borders of marble, in imitation of frames. The figures are included in them in <hi>mezzo-relievo:</hi> the one of Sir <hi>John Done,</hi> Knight, hereditary fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter and keeper of the foreſt of <hi>Delamere,</hi> who died in 1629. His figure is pictureſque, in a laced jacket, and a horn in his hand, the badge of his office: which horn deſcended to the different owners of the eſtate, and is now in the poſſeſſion of <hi>John Ardern,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>WHEN that <hi>Nimrod, James</hi> I. made a progreſs in 1617, he was entertained by this gentleman at <hi>Utkinton;</hi> 
                  <q>who ordered ſo <hi>wiſely</hi> and <hi>contentfully,</hi>
                  </q> ſays <hi>King</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vale Royal, ii. 106.]</note> 
                  <q>his Highneſs's ſports, that <hi>James</hi> conferred on him the honor of knighthood.</q> He married <hi>Dorothy,</hi> daughter of <hi>Thomas Wilbraham,</hi> Eſquire, of <hi>Woodhey;</hi> who left behind her ſo admirable a character, that, to this day, when a <hi>Cheſhire</hi> man would expreſs ſome excellency in one of the fair ſex, he would ſay, <hi>
                     <q>There is Lady Done for you.</q>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is of <hi>John Crew,</hi> Eſquire, ſecond ſon of Sir <hi>Randle Crew,</hi> of <hi>Crew,</hi> Knight, married to <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>John Done.</hi> His face is repreſented in profile, with long hair. He died 1670.</p>
               <p>His lady, and her elder ſiſter <hi>Jane Done,</hi> an antient virgin, lie at full length in the <hi>Utkinton</hi> chapel, with long and excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. One lies recumbent; the other reclined and ſtrait laced,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0369200900:14"/>
which give little grace in ſtatuary. <hi>Jane</hi> died in 1662; Mrs. <hi>Crew</hi> in 1690, aged 86.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>John Crew,</hi> Knight, ſon of Mr. <hi>John Crew,</hi> lies reclined on an altar-tomb, with a vaſt perriwig, and a <hi>Roman</hi> dreſs, with a whimpering genius at head and feet. Sir <hi>John</hi> married, firſt, <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter of <hi>Thomas Wagſtaff,</hi> of <hi>Tachbrook,</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> Eſquire; and for his ſecond, <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby Aſton,</hi> of <hi>Aſton,</hi> Baronet. He died in 1711, aged 71.</p>
               <p>I MUST not quit this place without letting fall a few tears, as a tribute to the memory of its honeſt rector <hi>John Allen;</hi> whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquarian knowlege and hoſpitality, I have often experienced on this great thoroughfare to the capital. From the antient recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial houſe, at the bottom of the town, is an aweful view of the great rock of <hi>Beeſton,</hi> backed by the <hi>Peckfreton</hi> hills, tempting me to take a nearer ſurvey.</p>
               <p>THE diſtance is about two miles. In my way I croſſed the canal at <hi>Beeſton Bridge,</hi> and called at the poor remains of <hi>Beeſton Hall,</hi> the manor-houſe, inhabited by the agent for the eſtate. This place was burnt by prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> during the civil wars. There is a tradition, that he had dined that day with the lady of the houſe. After dinner, he told her, that he was ſorry that he was obliged to make ſo bad return to her hoſpitality; adviſed her to ſecure any valuable effects ſhe had, for he muſt order the houſe to be burnt that night, leaſt it ſhould be garriſoned by the enemy.</p>
               <p>THIS manor had been part of the barony of <hi>Malpas,</hi> and was held under the lords, by the family of <hi>De Bunbury;</hi> who changed their <hi>Norman</hi> name, <hi>St. Pierre,</hi> and aſſumed that of the place where they firſt ſettled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0369200900:15"/>
IN 1271, or the fifty-ſixth of <hi>Henry</hi> III. <hi>Henry de Bunbury,</hi> and <hi>Margery</hi> his wife, gave it to their nephew <hi>Richard,</hi> who made the place his reſidence, and aſſumed its name. It continued in his family for many generations. Sir <hi>George Beeſton</hi> poſſeſſed it in the forty-fourth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> At length, by the marriage of <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>Hugh Beeſton,</hi> with <hi>William White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> of <hi>Leighton,</hi> it was conveyed into that houſe; and as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly transferred, by <hi>Bridget,</hi> heireſs of Mr. <hi>Whitemore,</hi> to <hi>Darcie Savage,</hi> ſecond ſon to <hi>Thomas</hi> Viſcount <hi>Savage,</hi> of <hi>Rock Savage;</hi> whoſe grand-daughter, another <hi>Bridget,</hi> brought it by marriage to Sir <hi>Thomas Moſtyn,</hi> Baronet, with the lordſhips of <hi>Peckfreton, Leighton,</hi> and <hi>Thornton;</hi> in whoſe houſe they ſtill remain. This lady was a <hi>Roman Catholic.</hi> Tradition is warm in her praiſe, and full of her domeſtic virtues, and the particular attention that ſhe ſhewed in obliging her domeſtics, of each religion, to attend their reſpective churches. Her huſband and ſhe were lovely and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they died within a day or two of each other, at <hi>Gloddaeth,</hi> in <hi>Caernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> and were interred in the neighboring church of <hi>Eglwys Rbôs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT a ſmall diſtance from the hall, is the great inſulated rock of <hi>Beeſton,</hi> compoſed of ſand-ſtone, very lofty and precipitous at one end, and ſloped down into the flat country at the other. Its height, from <hi>Beeſton Bridge</hi> to the ſummit, is three hundred and ſixty-ſix feet. From the ſummit is a moſt extenſive view on every part, except where interrupted by the <hi>Peckfreton</hi> hills. The land appears deeply indented by the eſtuary of the <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> and the canal from <hi>Cheſter</hi> appears a continued ſlender line of water from that city to almoſt the baſe of this eminence.

               <p>THIS rock is crowned with the ruins of a ſtrong fortreſs,<note place="margin">BEESTON CASTLE.</note> which roſe in the year 1220; founded by <hi>Randle Blondeville,</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> on his return out of the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> for which purpoſe, and for the building, of <hi>Chartley Caſtle,</hi> he raiſed a tax upon all his eſtates <note n="*" place="bottom">Polychronicon cccvi.</note>.

AT a ſmall diſtance from <hi>Bunbury,</hi> I fell into the great road, oppoſite to <hi>Alpram,</hi> a hamlet, whoſe name is corrupted from the <hi>Saxon Alburgham,</hi> in the <hi>Doomſday</hi> book. In after-times it was the ſeat of the <hi>Pages,</hi> now extinct.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE farther lies <hi>Calvely,</hi> long the property of that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious family, now likewiſe loſt.

               <p>MY road lay along the low unpleaſant lane that led towards <hi>Nantwich;</hi> the proſpect frequently deformed by the great foſſes of the unfortunate canal, falling in on each ſide of the road; for it croſſes at <hi>Barbridge,</hi> and is finiſhed from thence to <hi>Nantwich.</hi> This was only a ſecondary conſideration, executed on the hopes of conſiderable profit in the carriage of ſalt and cheeſe. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and principal object was, to continue the main trunk by <hi>Church Minſhul</hi> to the great <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> canal, near <hi>Middlewich,</hi> and by that means ſhare in the freight of the goods of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide of the kingdom: but various cauſes have fruſtrated all hopes of that benefit; and this part of the plan remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted.</p>
               <p>AT <hi>Acton</hi> the proſpect mends a little.

                  <hi>Actune,</hi> as it is ſtiled in the <hi>Doomſday</hi> book, was a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable place. There were eight hides of land taxable: there were thirty plough-lands; in the lord's demeſn three: two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, thirteen villeyns, and fifteen boors, with ſeven plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, a mill for the uſe of the court (<hi>curiae</hi>) and ten acres of meadow: a wood ſix leagues long, and one broad: an aery of hawks: two preſbyters, who had a plough-land: two aliens, having a plough-land and a half: a ſervant: ſix villeyns: ſeven boors, with four plough-lands.</p>
               <p>THIS not only ſhews the greatneſs of this <hi>Saxon</hi> manor, but that it was the ſeat of <hi>Morkar,</hi> by the proviſion made for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The tenants had likewiſe the right of pleas in the hall of their lord, and one houſe in <hi>Wich (Nantwich)</hi> where they might make ſalt without interruption. In the time of the Confeſſor, the manor was valued at ten pounds a year; at the Conqueſt, at only ſix. It may be obſerved, once for all, that the troubles oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned at that event, and the ravages committed, inſtantly ſunk the value of the land.</p>
               <p>AT the Conqueſt, this place was a member of the barony of <hi>Wich Malhang,</hi> or <hi>Nantwich.

He alſo left to the ſame church part of <hi>Chriſt's croſs,</hi> which the wife of his half-brother had ſhut up in wax, and a competent ſalary for a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to ſay a competent number of maſſes, in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s chapel, for the ſake of his ſon, for ſeven years, when it might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been redeemed from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and

After his death, which happened in 1399, a magnificent tomb was erected beneath a Gothic arch, with a large embattled ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure. Under the arch lies Sir <hi>William</hi> in full armour, with ſuppliant hands. His head is caſed in a conic helm, bound with a fillet entwined with foliage. From his helmet is a guard of mail, which covers his neck, and riſes to his lips; over which flow two great whiſkers. His head reſts on a caſque, with an aſs's head for a creſt. Above, within the arch, is a row of half-lengths, with a book oppoſite to each; probably religious, chaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>requiem.</hi> The whole is painted. On the edge of the tomb was this inſcription, now much defaced by time: <hi>Hic jacet William Manwaring quondam dominum de Badeleye, qui obiit die Veneris xx<hi rend="sup">o</hi> ante feſtum Pentecoſtae, anno Dni. m<hi rend="sup">o</hi>ccc<hi rend="sup">o</hi> nonogeſſimo nono.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE tomb of Sir <hi>Thomas Wilbraham,</hi> Baronet, and his lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>Roger Wilbraham,</hi> Knight, and one of the Maſters of Requeſt to <hi>James</hi> I. is very handſome. Their figures are placed on an altar-tomb, in white marble, recumbent: he in armour, long curled hair, and a turn-over, with one hand in his breaſt, the other by his ſide. Beneath him is ſpread a large cloak. The lady has a book in one hand; the other, like his, reclines on her breaſt. He died in 1660.</p>
               <p>THIS tomb is a ſpecimen of the firſt deviation of the old form: a greater eaſe of attitude began to prevail. The hands, which uſed to be erect, cloſe, and ſuppliant, here vary in the attitude, and ſhew a dawning of the grace that reigned on the revival of ſculpture. In <hi>England,</hi> monumental beauty was ſoon ruined by the ſervile copying the dreſs of the times; by having night-gowns

               <p>THE church had been long the place of ſepulture of the houſes of <hi>Woodhey</hi> and <hi>Badeley.</hi> The vain attention of our forefathers to poſthumous honors and ſuperſtitious rites, is well exemplified from the probate of the will of <hi>William Wilbraham,</hi> of <hi>Woodhey,</hi> who died in 1536; by which <q>he bequeaths his body to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the image of our Lady, in the chancel of the church of <hi>Acton,</hi> and beſtows x<hi rend="sup">9</hi>. to be laid out on a tenor bell, if the pariſh will provide the reſt; but if not, then the money to be laid out on a <hi>pax</hi> and two <hi>cruytts</hi> of ſilver, to ſerve at the high altar on good days. He further wills, that 12 white gowns be given to 12 a poor men; as alſo, that 12 torches be made, to hold about his body the day of his burial; and that a light be over him, with viii. tapers, in the middle whereof a bigger taper ſhould ſpring out; alſo, that penny-dole ſhould be given at his burial, to every perſon that would take it.</q>
               </p>

               <p>FROM <hi>Acton,</hi> I went down a gentle deſcent to <hi>Nantwich,</hi> about a mile diſtant. Antiently this place was known only by the name of <hi>Wich,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Skinner's Etymologicon.</hi> Notwithſtanding the word does not appear to have any thing to do with ſalt, yet <hi>wich,</hi> or <hi>wych,</hi> is always applied, with us, to places where ſalt is found; as <hi>Droitwich, Nantwich,</hi> &amp;c and the houſes in which it is made, are called <hi>wych</hi> houſes.</note> an <hi>Anglo-Saxon</hi> word for diſtrict, or habitation; and a very common termination of a multitude of places. Here the <hi>Britiſh Nant</hi> is added, to ſhew its low ſituation.</p>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY before the Conqueſt, its revenues were divided between the <hi>king</hi> and earl <hi>Edwin.</hi> After that event, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by the great proprietor of <hi>Cheſhire, Hugh Lupus,</hi> on <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Malhedeng,</hi> or <hi>de Malhang,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> chieftain; from whom it was called <hi>Wich Malhang. Hugh</hi> erected it into a barony, in favor of <hi>Malhedeng,</hi> and honored him with a ſeat in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement.</p>
               <p>THIS dignity continued only in him and his two ſons, <hi>Hugh</hi> and <hi>William.</hi> The laſt died without iſſue male. Of his three daughters, <hi>Alionora,</hi> the eldeſt, by marriage of her daughter <hi>Joan,</hi> conveyed her ſhare to the Lord <hi>Lovels; Philippa,</hi> the ſecond, to the <hi>Audleys;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>BY theſe marriages, the barony became divided into four, reckoning the part which had been given by <hi>Hugh Malhang</hi> to the abbey of <hi>Cumbermere;</hi> and ſoon after, by different alliances, became ſplit into multitudes of other ſhares.</p>

WHEN entire, it was under the government of the lord, or his ſteward; who were veſted with the uſual baronial powers. This town had been governed by a bailiff; but the election of that officer being dropt, it is at preſent under the government of the conſtables. It has likewiſe ſeveral other officers, ſuch as the <hi>rulers of walling,</hi> who were guardians of the ſalt-ſprings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated all matters reſpecting their important ſtaple of the place <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Hiſtory of Nantwich,</hi> 1774.</note>.</p>
               <p>AFTER them came the <hi>ale-taſters;</hi> whoſe office related to the aſſize of bread and drink.</p>
               <p>THE next were the <hi>health-keepers;</hi> who attended to the right of the beam-heath, antiently called the <hi>creach;</hi> and took care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from all incroachments, or treſpaſſers.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>leave-lookers</hi> ſuperintended the markets, inſpected the weights, and deſtroyed unwholeſome meat of every kind. Theſe correſponded a good deal with the <hi>Aediles cereales</hi> of the <hi>Romans;</hi> as the next officers, the <hi>fire-lookers,</hi> did to the <hi>triumviri nocturni.</hi> They had the care of the chimnies, and were to guard againſt all accidents that might ariſe from fire.</p>
               <p>THE town is large, but conſiſts chiefly of old houſes. The <hi>Weever,</hi> which divides it in unequal parts, is here a ſmall ſtream, and not navigable higher than <hi>Winsford Bridge.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Nantwich</hi> had, many years ago, an act for making this river navigable from that place to their town; but they never carried the power into execution. The <hi>Cheſter</hi> canal is now completed from that city, and finiſhes in a handſome broad baſon, near the road between <hi>Acton</hi> and the town; but at this time, it remains
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0369200900:35"/>
an almoſt uſeleſs ornament to the country; nor has it, as might have been expected, given the leſt increaſe to the ſalt-trade, for which this antient town was once ſo diſtinguiſhed. Unfortunately for it, the other ſalt-towns lie more conveniently for commerce, and abound almoſt to exceſs with that uſeful article.</p>
               <p>THE chief trade of the place is in ſhoes, which are ſent to <hi>London.</hi> Here is a ſmall manufacture of gloves; but thoſe of bone-lace and ſtockings, once conſiderable, are now loſt. In the reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> I. the tanning buſineſs brought much wealth into the town.</p>
               <p>THE ſalt made from the adjacent brine-ſprings, formed once a very important buſineſs. In the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> here were two hundred and ſixteen ſalt-works, of ſix <hi>leads-walling</hi> each: in 1774, only two works, of five large pans of wrought iron. The duty produced from them amounts annually to near five thouſand pounds: from the whole diſtrict, including the works at <hi>Lawton,</hi> and a ſmall one at <hi>Droitwich,</hi> from eighteen to twenty thouſand pounds. The tax on this uſeful article is very conſiderable; which it bears, as being of moſt cheap fabrick, and moſt univerſal uſe. It ſeems, for that reaſon, to have been one of the earlieſt taxes of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> near 640 years before <hi>Chriſt, ſalinarum vectigal inſtituit</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Aurelius Victor,</hi> c. v.</note>. This tribute was continued on the <hi>Britons</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> poſſeſſed our iſle.</p>
               <p>THE latter alſo made ſalt part of the pay of their ſoldiers, which was called <hi>ſalarium;</hi> and from which is derived our word <hi>ſalary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE art of making ſalt was known in very early times, to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0369200900:36"/>
                  <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans:</hi> it is not, therefore, likely that the <hi>Britons,</hi> who had, in ſeveral places, plenty of ſalt-ſprings, ſhould be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it. The way of making it was very ſimple, but very dirty; for they did no more than fling the water on burning wood; the water evaporated by the heat, and left the ſalt adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aſhes, or charcoal <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Plinii Hiſt. Nat.</hi> lib. xxxi. c. 7. <hi>Galliae Germaniaeque</hi> ardentibus lignis aquam ſalſam infundunt.</note>.</p>
               <p>IT is very probable that the <hi>Britons</hi> uſed the ſpring of <hi>Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> for this purpoſe; numbers of pieces of half-burnt wood being frequently dug up in this neighborhood. <hi>Salinis</hi> was a place not far from hence, one of the wiches; but I am uncertain which. The <hi>Romans</hi> made uſe of the ſprings, and made ſalt by much the ſame proceſs as we do at preſent. The ſalt produced was white. It ſtruck the natives, who ſtiled this place, perhaps the firſt place where they ſaw ſalt of this kind, <hi>Heledd-Wen,</hi> or the white brine-pits, to diſtinguiſh them from the ſprings which they uſed in ſo ſlovenly a faſhion.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> were acquainted with rock-ſalt, but had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it within the limits of <hi>Italy.</hi> There were mountains of ſalt in <hi>India. Spain</hi> afforded the tranſparent colorleſs rock-ſalt, and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> the deep yellow <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Piiny,</hi> lib.xxxi. c. 7. <hi>Strabe,</hi> lib. xx. 1057. But the rock-ſalt of our iſland remained undiſcovered till paſt the middle of the laſt century.</note>. The <hi>Romans</hi> were converſant in the methods of producing this uſeful article from the brine <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fit et e putcis in ſalinas ingeſtis. <hi>Plin.</hi> xxxi. 7.</note>, which they practiſed in our iſland, and communicated their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the natives. Salt was an early import into <hi>Britain,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0369200900:37"/>
but it was only to the <hi>Caſſiterides,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Strabo,</hi> 265.</note> and the neighboring parts, which were remote from the ſalt-ſprings.</p>
               <p>THESE advantages are but ſparingly ſcattered over <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are totally deſtitute of them. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> there are ſeveral, but few that contain ſalt ſufficient to be worked. Thus, there are ſome which riſe out of the middle of the <hi>Were,</hi> in the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham;</hi> others in <hi>Yorkſhire, Cumberland, Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Oxfordſhire:</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Campbel's Politic, Survey,</hi> i. 76.</note> all thoſe are neglected, either on account of their weakneſs, or, in ſome places, by reaſon of the dearneſs of fuel. Theſe in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and thoſe at <hi>Droit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> with the ſmall works at <hi>Weſton</hi> in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> are the only places where any buſineſs is done. <hi>Droit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> were worked by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had the common name of <hi>Salinae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM that period to the preſent, they have been ſucceſſively in uſe. The <hi>Saxons,</hi> according to their idea of liberty, divided them between the king, the great people, and the freemen. Thus, at <hi>Nantwich</hi> was one brine-pit, which gave employ to numbers of <hi>ſalinae,</hi> or works. Eight of them were between the king and earl <hi>Edwin,</hi> of which the king had two ſhares of the profits, the earl one. <hi>Edwin</hi> had likewiſe a work near his manor of <hi>Aghton,</hi> out of which was made ſalt ſufficient for the annual conſumption of his houſhold; but if any was ſold, the king had a tax of two pence, and the earl of one penny.</p>
               <p>IN this place were likewiſe numbers of works belonging to the people of the neighborhood; which had this uſage: From <hi>Aſcenſion-day</hi> to the feaſt of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> they might carry home
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0369200900:38"/>
what ſalt they pleaſed; but if they ſold any on the ſpot, or any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the county, they were to pay a tax to the king and the earl: but after the feaſt of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> whoſoever took the ſalt home, whether his own, or purchaſed from other works, was to pay toll, except the before-mentioned work of the earl; which enjoyed exemption, according to antient uſage.</p>
               <p>IT appears, that the king and earl farmed out their eight works; for they were obliged to give, on the <hi>Friday</hi> of the weeks in which they were worked, xvi. boilings; of which xv. made one <hi>ſum</hi> of ſalt. This is a meaſure, which, according to <hi>Spelman,</hi> amounts to a horſe-load, oreight buſhels. The pans of other people, from <hi>Aſcenſion-day</hi> to that of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> were not ſubject to this farm on the <hi>Friday;</hi> but from <hi>St. Martin's day</hi> to <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> they were liable to thoſe cuſtoms, in the ſame manner as thoſe of the king and the earl.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Welſh</hi> uſed to ſupply themſelves from theſe pits, before the union of our country with <hi>England. Henry</hi> III. in order to diſtreſs them, during the wars he had with them, took care to put a ſtop to the works, and deprive them of this neceſſary article.</p>
               <p>ALL theſe ſalt-works were confined between the river and a certain ditch. If any perſon was guilty of a crime, within theſe limits, he was at liberty of making atonement by a mulct of two ſhillings, or xxx. boilings of ſalt; except in the caſe of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or theft, for which he was to ſuffer death. If crimes of that nature were committed without the precinct, the common uſage of the county was to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>IN the time of the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> this place yielded a rent of xx
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0369200900:39"/>
pounds, with all the pleas of the hundred; but when earl <hi>Hugh</hi> received it, it was a waſte.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Germans</hi> had an idea of a peculiar ſanctity attendant on ſalt-ſprings; that they were nearer to heaven than other places; that the prayers of mortals were nowhere ſooner heard; and that, by the peculiar favor of the gods, the rivers and the woods were productive of ſalt, not, as in other places, by the virtue of the ſea, but by the water being poured on a burning pile of wood <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>NEAR the end of this ſtreet ſtands a large houſe, called <hi>Town's End,</hi> till of late the reſidence of the very worthy family of the <hi>Wilbrahams;</hi> that honeſt and diſtinguiſhed lawyer, the late <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Wilbraham,</hi> was a younger brother of the late owner, and, with unblemiſhed reputation, raiſed a vaſt fortune by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.

               <p>THE church is a very handſome pile, in form of a croſs, with an octagonal tower in the centre. The eaſt and weſt windows are filled with elegant tracery.

               <p>THIS town was the only one in the county which continued firm to the parlement from the beginning to the end of the civil wars.

               <p>I CONTINUED my journey along the <hi>London</hi> road, flat, tedious, and heavy. At the fourth ſtone lieth, a little out of the way, <hi>Wibbunbury,</hi> a ſmall village, ſuppoſed to have taken, its name from <hi>Wibba,</hi> ſecond king of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> who died in 615. The manor was antiently in the great family of the <hi>Praers.</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Praer</hi> gave it to his ſon <hi>Richard,</hi> about the reign of King <hi>John,</hi> upon condition of rendering to the heirs of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two barbed arrows yearly, on the feaſt of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in lieu of all other ſervices. But the <hi>Praers</hi> remitted all their right in this manor, and the patronage of the church, to the biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> in 1276, the fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> I. and the biſhops continued to be lords of the manor
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0369200900:47"/>
till the ſecond of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> about which time it was alienated: but the biſhops ſtill continue patrons of the church.</p>
               <p>THERE had been, in much earlier times, a family in this place which took their name from it; for <hi>Richard de Wibbunbury</hi> was ſheriff of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> in 1233. Whether the <hi>Praers</hi> ever aſſumed that name, is uncertain. It is probable, that the <hi>Richard</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned was the ſame with the ſheriff, and took the addition on receiving the place from his father.</p>
               <p>THIS village was formerly ſurrounded with gentlemen's ſeats. Among thoſe was <hi>Lee,</hi> the reſidence of a family of the ſame name; from which were deſcended the <hi>Lees,</hi> earls of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> derived from <hi>Benedict,</hi> a ſon of this houſe, who made a ſettlement at <hi>Quarendon,</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>THE church is a very handſome building, embattled and pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled: the tower lofty; the roof is timbered on the inſide, and carved with the arms of the various benefactors. Part of the church was taken down in 1591; at which time many of the monuments were deſtroyed: of thoſe remaining, are ſeveral in memory of the <hi>Delves</hi> of <hi>Doddington.</hi> The moſt antient is a large altar-tomb of alabaſter, with the figures of a father, and ſon, and lady, engraven on the ſtone: at the feet of each is a dog, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, a dolphin: on the front of the tomb, ſeveral figures, their progeny. The perſons repreſented are Sir <hi>John Delves,</hi> his ſon <hi>John,</hi> and his wife <hi>Ellen,</hi> daughter of <hi>Ralph Egerton,</hi> of <hi>Wrinehill,</hi> in the county of <hi>Stafford;</hi> for which, probably on account of conſanguinity, a diſpenſation was granted in 1439 <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>SIR <hi>John</hi> was in high favor with <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and enjoyed ſeveral
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0369200900:48"/>
lucrative poſts under him. This he repaid with the moſt faithful adherence, raiſed forces in his ſupport, and loſt his life valiantly fighting, in the fatal field at <hi>Tewkeſbury,</hi> on <hi>Saturday, May</hi> the 4th, 1471. His ſon, with numbers of perſons of diſtinction, took refuge in the abbey. The furious <hi>Edward</hi> purſued them, with his drawn ſword, into the church <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Stow's Annals,</hi> 424.</note>; but was oppoſed by a reſolute prieſt, who for the preſent diverted his vengeance by liſting up the <hi>hoſt,</hi> interpoſing the ſacred myſtery, and denied him admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance till he obtained a promiſe of pardon; depending on the king's word, they neglected making their eſcape, and continued in the ſanctuary till the <hi>Monday,</hi> when the relentleſs monarch cauſed them to be drawn out and beheaded, according to the cuſtom of the times, without any proceſs. The bodies of this unfortunate pair were at firſt buried at <hi>Tewkeſbury</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ralph,</hi> the ſecond ſon of Sir <hi>John,</hi> and his wife <hi>Catharine,</hi> are repreſented on a tomb by two braſs plates. The inſcription im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that he died the 11th <hi>March,</hi> 1513.</p>
               <p>THE tomb of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> of the <hi>Hough,</hi> in this pariſh, and his lady, is magnificent in its kind. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> lies beneath a canopy, ſupported by four pillars of the <hi>Ionic order,</hi> of white marble, gilt and painted. He is repreſented recumbent and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0369200900:49"/>
armed, with his gauntlets lying at his feet: his hair long, curled, and flowing: his viſage bearded and whiſkered. His lady (<hi>Anne,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi>) has a faſhionable fore-top, a great ruff, and extended hood. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> died on the 21ſt of <hi>December</hi> 1614; and his relict erected this monumental com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment.</p>
               <p>ON getting into the great road, I paſſed on the left the ſcite of the antient ſeat of <hi>Lee,</hi> and an iron forge.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE farther ſtood the antient ſeat of <hi>Doddington,</hi> origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally belonging to a family of the ſame name; but in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> II. paſſed to the <hi>Praers:</hi> in 1352, the twenty-ſixth of <hi>Edward</hi> III. to the <hi>Breſcies,</hi> by marriage with the heireſs of the houſe: but in the thirtieth of the ſame reign, <hi>John Breſcie,</hi> with <hi>Margaret</hi> his wife, alienated it to <hi>John Delves,</hi> of <hi>Delveſhall</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> one of the four renowned 'ſquires who diſtinguiſhed themſelves under the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> at the battle of <hi>Poitiers.</hi> Sir <hi>John Berniers,</hi> Lord <hi>Bourchier,</hi> the noble tranſlator of <hi>Froiſſart,</hi> relates the deed with all the ſimplicity of the original. <q>But when Lord <hi>James Audeley</hi> ſawe that ſhoulde nedes fyght (he ſayde to the Prynce) I have alwaies ſerved truly my lorde your father, and you alſo, and ſhall do as long as I live. I ſay this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I made ones a vow, that the firſt batayle that other the Kynge your father, or anie of his chyldren, ſhoulde be at, howe that I wulde be one of the fyrſt ſetters on, or elſe to dye in the ſayle. Therefore I requyre your Grace, as in rewarde for any ſervyce that ever I dyde to the Kynge your father, or to you, that you will gyve me licence to departe fro' you, and to ſet up my ſelf there, as I maye accomplyſhe my vowe.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0369200900:50"/>
this daye that grace to be the beſt Knyght of all others, and to take hym by the hande. Than the Knyght departed fro the Prince, and went to the foremoſt front of all the batayles all, onely accompanyed with four Squyers, who promyſed nat to ſayle him. This Lorde <hi>James</hi> was a ryghte ſage and a valiant knyght, and by hym was muche of the hooſte ordeyned and governed the day before. — The Lord <hi>James Audeley,</hi> with his foure Squyers, was in the front of that battel, and theſe dyd marvels in armes; and by great prowes, he came and fought with Sir <hi>Arnolde Dandrchen,</hi> under his own banner; and there they fought longe togyder, and Sir <hi>Arnolde</hi> was there ſore han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled. — And there was Sir <hi>Arnolde Dandrchen</hi> taken pryſoner by other men than by Syr <hi>James Audeley</hi> or his foure Squyers; for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daye he never toke priſoner, but always foughte and wente on his enemyes. — On the <hi>Englyſhe</hi> parte, the Lord <hi>James Audeley,</hi> with the ayde of his foure Squyers, foughte alwayes in the chyefe of the batayle: he was ſore hurte in the bodye, and in the vyſage. As longe as his breth ſerved him he fought: at laſt, at the end of the batayle hys foure Squyers toke and brought hym out of the felde, and layed hym under a hedge ſyde, for to refreſhe hym. And they unarmed hym, and bounde up his woundes as well as they coude.—After the battle, the Prince demanded of the Knyghtes that were aboute him, for the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> if any knewe any thing of him. Some Knights y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were there anſwered and ſayde, Sir, he is ſore hurt, and lieth in a litter here beſide; by my faith, ſaid the Prince, of his hurts I am right forye, go and knowe if he maye be broughte hider, or els I will go, and ſe him there, as he is.

countries abundant in grain, it affords a conveyance of corn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to paſt ages. At preſent, nothing but a general dearth can create a ſcarcity in any part adjacent to this extenſive work.</p>
               <p>THESE, and many other advantages, are derived, both to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals and the public, from this internal navigation. But when it happens that the kingdom is engaged in a foreign war, with what ſecurity is the trade between thoſe three great ports carried on; and with how much leſs expence has the trader his goods conveyed to any part of the kingdom, than he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſubject to, when the goods were obliged to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried coaſtways, and to pay inſurance?</p>
               <p>I BELIEVE it may be aſſerted, that no undertaking, equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive and arduous, was ever attempted by private people in any kingdom; and, in juſtice to the adventurers, it muſt be allowed, that, conſidering the difficulties they met with, owing to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the works, or the caprice of perſons whoſe lands were taken to make the canal, that ten years and a half was but a ſhort time to perform it in; and that ſatisfaction has been made to every individual who ſuffered any injury by the execution of the undertaking. The profits ariſing from tonnage is already very conſiderable; and there is no doubt but they will increaſe annually; and, notwithſtanding the enormous ſum of money it has coſt in the execution, the proprietors will be amply repaid, and have the comfort to reflect, that, by the concluſion of this project, they have contributed to the good of their country, and acquired wealth for themſelves and poſterity.</p>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY after leaving <hi>Stonefield,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">STONE</note> reached the little town of <hi>Stone,</hi> a place remarkable for religious antiquity. <hi>Legend</hi> tells
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0369200900:71"/>
us, that the before-mentioned <hi>Wulferus,</hi> then a Pagan, put to death his two ſons, <hi>Wulfad</hi> and <hi>Rufin,</hi> on ſuſpicion of favoring the Chriſtian faith; <hi>Wulfad</hi> at this place, <hi>Rufin</hi> at <hi>Burſton,</hi> about three miles diſtant. Over each, ſtones were erected, as uſual, in memory of the dead; from whence the names of thoſe places are derived. <hi>Wulfere,</hi> after this unnatural deed, was ſtruck with the utmoſt remorſe, and, by the influence of his queen and St. <hi>Cedda,</hi> or <hi>Chad,</hi> who lived in a neighboring hermitage, was converted to the religion he had ſo lately perſecuted; and, by way of expiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his guilt, among other works of piety, founded at <hi>Stone</hi> a college of canons regular, <note place="margin">COLLEGE.</note> about the year 670. His queen <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menilda</hi> is ſaid to have alſo founded a nunnery here. On the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> the religious were diſperſed; but on the abatement of the cruelty of thoſe barbarians, it is probable they returned, or at left a new eſtabliſhment was formed. This is certain, that religious were found here after the Conqueſt; for there is an idle tale of two nuns and a prieſt being ſlain there, by <hi>Enyſan,</hi> a <hi>Norman.</hi> This <hi>Enyſan,</hi> of <hi>Walton,</hi> was the true re-founder. Caution muſt be uſed in reading the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of theſe times, which are filled with pious romance. Little credit ſhould alſo be given to the murder of the ſons of <hi>Wulfere.</hi> The <hi>Saxon Chronicle</hi> is ſilent about the deed. That prince was a convert to Chriſtianity, and ſeems to have founded the houſe through the common motives of zeal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enyſan,</hi> on his re-eſtabliſhment of this houſe, filled it with canons from <hi>Kenelworth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">PRIORY.</note> and made it a cell to that place. The <hi>Staffords,</hi> who were his ſuperiors, aſſumed the honor of this new foundation; and a ſecond <hi>Robert de Stafford,</hi> about the year 1260, rendered it free from <hi>Kenelworth,</hi> excepting the right of patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0369200900:72"/>
and a yearly penſion. The church of this priory was the place of interment of ſeveral of this great family; and numbers of magnificent tombs, with their figures in alabaſter, lay there till the diſſolution; when they were removed to the <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> on <hi>Stafford Green.</hi> I ſee on the road-ſide a fragment of a thick wall, perhaps a remnant of the priory. The church is quite new, and is a very elegant building, dedicated to St. <hi>Wulfad,</hi> one of the ſuppoſed martyrs. At the time of the ſuppreſſion, a tablet, giving the whole hiſtory of the houſe, was hung up in the priory: it is related in old <hi>Engliſh</hi> metre; but is ſo tedious, that I muſt refer the readers, who deſire to peruſe it, to the cited author. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <note place="margin">ASTON.</note> I ſaw on the right a large houſe called <hi>Aſton,</hi> originally the property of a branch of the <hi>Heveninghams</hi> of <hi>Suffolk.

He alſo built in the garden a <hi>mauſoleum;</hi> in which, I think, he is interred. The place is at preſent the property of <hi>Edward Weld,</hi> Eſquire, of <hi>Lulworth</hi> caſtle, in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and deſcended to him of late years, by virtue of a marriage of an anceſtor with a daughter of this houſe, in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
               <p>THE road from this place, <note place="margin">BURSTON.</note> for ſeveral miles, paſſes along a pretty vale, watered by the <hi>Trent,</hi> bounded by two hills, and much enlivened by the courſe of the canal. About the third mile from <hi>Stone,</hi> I went by <hi>Burſton,</hi> a ſmall hamlet, noted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for a chapel erected over the ſpot where <hi>Rufin,</hi> ſecond ſon of <hi>Wulfere,</hi> was ſuppoſed to have been martyred; and on that account, in old times, greatly frequented by the devout.</p>
               <p>ABOUT a quarter of a mile from hence, on the top of a hill,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0369200900:73"/>
ſtands the church of <hi>Sandon.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">SANDON.</note> This manor, in the twentieth of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, was in the hands of the king; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it on <hi>Hugh Lupus;</hi> and he again gave it to <hi>William de Malbanc,</hi> or <hi>Nantwich.</hi> It paſſed from this family (by the gift of <hi>Adena,</hi> eldeſt daughter of <hi>William,</hi> grandſon to the former) to <hi>Warren de Verdon;</hi> and by his daughter <hi>Alditha,</hi> to Sir <hi>William Stafford;</hi> and by the marriage of <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter of one of his deſcendants, in the twelfth of <hi>Edward</hi> III. to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Erdeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wik.</hi> It continued in poſſeſſion of that family till the reign of <hi>James</hi> I. In his time it was ſold to <hi>George Digby,</hi> groom of the ſtole to that monarch, by his half-brother <hi>Richard Erdeſwik. Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Gerard,</hi> of <hi>Bromley,</hi> became maſter of it, by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with a daughter of Mr. <hi>Digby;</hi> whoſe grand-daughter, by matching with <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> conveyed it to Lord <hi>Archibald Hamilton;</hi> who, in 1776, diſpoſed of it to Lord <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowby.</hi> A law-ſuit concerning this place gave riſe to the fatal duel, in <hi>November</hi> 1712, between <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and Lord <hi>Mohun;</hi> in which both combatants loſt their lives.</p>
               <p>THE antient manſion ſtood near the church, within a moat; but is now demoliſhed, and a beautiful houſe, commanding a fine view, was built by Lord <hi>Archibald Hamilton,</hi> on an eminence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over the <hi>Cheſter</hi> road. The ſteep ſlope is beautiful, cloathed with plantations of recent date, but extremely flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
               <p>THE church is in the gift of Lord <hi>Harrowby.</hi> Before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, it belonged to the abbey of <hi>Cumbermere;</hi> being beſtowed on it by the founder, <hi>Hugh de Malbanc.</hi>

               <p>THE monuments are curious. The fineſt is in memory of the celebrated <hi>Sampſon Erdeſwik,</hi> the learned antiquary of the county;

This fortreſs was very ſoon permitted to fall in decay. <hi>Leland</hi> ſpeaks of it as a ruin in his days. When the power of the nobility was broken, by the policy of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. numbers of the barons, finding their caſtle no longer a protection to their inſolence, were glad to quit ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious a kind of habitation. We often ſee, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance, an antient manſion near the remains, or on the ſcite of a more antient caſtle: the times were ſo much bettered, and monarchy had recovered ſo much rightful ſtrength, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer became uſeleſs againſt; their prince, or their rival <hi>reguli,</hi> who then began to acknowlege the power of law.

               <p>
                  <hi>Chartley</hi> caſtle was built by <hi>Randle Blundeville,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in 1220, on his return from the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and to defray the expences of this, as alſo of <hi>Beeſton,</hi> which he alſo founded, a tax was levied on all his vaſſals.

The lady was at that time only eleven years and eight months old; but by the king's ſpecial favor, in 1452, ſhe had livery of her lands, without further proof of her age. This eſtate continued in his poſterity (the Lords <hi>Ferrars,</hi> Viſcounts <hi>Hereford,</hi> and Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) till the year 1646, when it fell to Sir <hi>Robert Shirley,</hi> by his marriage with <hi>Dorothy,</hi> youngeſt ſiſter to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the noted parlement-general; and is at preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by their deſcendant Earl <hi>Ferrers.</hi>

               <p>I FOUND here only the tomb of <hi>Walter,</hi> firſt Viſcount <hi>Hereford,</hi> grandſon of the firſt Lord <hi>Ferrers,</hi> and founder of the houſe of <hi>Chartley.</hi> He ſerved with honor in the <hi>French</hi> wars, under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII; and in the naval attack of <hi>Conquet,</hi> in 1512, he was honored with the garter by his royal maſter, and with the title of <hi>Hereford</hi> by his ſucceſſor. His death happened in 1558. He lies here under a fine monument, erected in his life-time; his figure is repreſented in robes, with the collar of the garter round his neck: his head repoſed on a plume of feathers, wreathed round a helmet.

               <p>THIS manor, about the time of <hi>Henry</hi> II. was the property of <hi>Eudo de Mutton;</hi> in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. it was transferred to the family of the <hi>Chetwynds,</hi> by the marriage of <hi>Iſabel,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Philip de Mutton,</hi> with Sir <hi>John de Chetwynd;</hi> in which line it continues, being at preſent owned by <hi>John Chetwynd Talbot,</hi> Eſquire, grandſon of <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Chetwynd.</hi>

The preſent church of <hi>Ingeſtre</hi> was rebuilt by him, and was conſecrated in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1677. A ſermon was preached, prayers read, a child baptized, a woman churched, a couple married, a corpſe buried, the ſacraments adminiſtred, and, to crown all, Mr. <hi>Chetwynd</hi> made an offering on the altar of the tythes of <hi>Hopton,</hi> worth fifty pounds a year, to be added to the rectory for ever. The church is very neat, and is prettily ſtuccoed. In it is a mural monument, in memory of its great benefactor, who died in 1692.</p>

They were all undergoing a removal; therefore I avoid further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, until they are fixed in their permanent ſituations. But I muſt not be ſilent about the collection of coins, one of the moſt valuable and inſtructive in <hi>England,</hi> the bequeſt of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved neighbor and friend <hi>Thomas Anſon,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>THE park is at ſome diſtance from the houſe. <note place="margin">PARK.</note> The oaks are of a very great ſize: a twin-tree was lately ſold for £.120, and ſome ſingle ones for half that ſum; and I am told, that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral now ſtanding equally large.</p>
               <p>THE church is very near the houſe, <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> in the gift of Sir <hi>William Bagot,</hi> dedicated to St. <hi>Leonard.</hi> Within, are ſeveral ſculptured tombs, of the time of the fifteenth century; ſome with imaged figures, others engraven; moſtly in memorial of the <hi>Bagots:</hi> one of an <hi>Aſton</hi> of <hi>Broughton,</hi> and another expreſſed by a little ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of a <hi>Broughton,</hi> a child of three months old. The monument of Sir <hi>Edward Bagot,</hi> who died in 1673, is mural, and ſuperſedes the ten commandments, being placed over the altar. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription tells us, that he was a true aſſertor of epiſcopacy in the church, and hereditary monarchy in the ſtate; which probably
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0369200900:103"/>
entitled him, in thoſe days, to this ſacred place. On the outſide of the church, two modeſt heaps of turf, parallel to each other, mark the ſpot where the remains of the laſt amiable owners of the place repoſe; whole merit ſurvives in their ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>I FOUND myſelf here not very diſtant from <hi>Whichenoure Hall,</hi> and could not reſiſt the deſire of viſiting the ſeat of the celebrated <hi>Flitch,</hi> the deſperate reward of conjugal affection.</p>

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by party rage, a ſkirmiſh enſued: Sir <hi>William</hi> was ſlain on the ſpot. Sir <hi>Robert</hi> proceeded to the field, and met his fate with the gallant <hi>Percy.</hi> What a picture is this accident, of the miſeries of civil diſſenſion!

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0369200900:110"/>
worthy owners of the manor, were deterred from entering into the holy ſtate, through the dread of not obtaining a ſingle raſher from their own bacon.</p>
               <p>THE firſt peſſeſſor of this manor was Sir <hi>Walter de Somervile,</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> on whom it was beſtowed by the Conqueror. It reſted in his family till the death of the above-mentioned Sir <hi>Philip de So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mervile,</hi> who left two daughters, <hi>Joan,</hi> wife of Sir <hi>Rhys ap Griffith,</hi> Knight; and <hi>Maud,</hi> married to <hi>Edmund Vernon.</hi> This eſtate fell to the former, and remained in the family till the laſt century, when it was ſold by <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter or widow to <hi>Henry Griffith,</hi> to — <hi>Offley,</hi> Eſquire, anceſtor to the late owner; who, within theſe few years, alienated it to the preſent <hi>John Levet,</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT tell the preciſe year in which it was ſold to Mr. <hi>Offley;</hi> but it appears that <hi>Henry Griffith</hi> was living in 1597.</p>
               <p>IN compliance with my original plan, I took the ſame way, in order to return into the great road. Soon after,<note place="margin">RUDGLEY.</note> repaſſing the <hi>Trent,</hi> at <hi>Colton</hi> bridge, I reached <hi>Rudgley,</hi> a ſmall town, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for its great annual fairs for horſes of the coach breed.</p>
               <p>THE church is a little north of the town, <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> is dedicated to Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and is a vicarage belonging to the chapter of <hi>Lichfield.</hi> Oppoſite is a very antient timber-houſe, belonging once to the <hi>Chetwynds;</hi> at preſent to Mr. <hi>Anſon.</hi> On an eminence, above the town, is beautifully ſituated a large houſe, formerly belonging to the <hi>Weſtons,</hi> greatly enlarged and improved by the preſent owner, <hi>Aſhton Curzon,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>THE antient owners of <hi>Rudgley</hi> were of the ſame name with the town: ſome of the family had the honor of being ſheriffs of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0369200900:111"/>
county, in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III: another was knight of the ſhire, in the ſame period. The name continued here till after the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. <hi>Erdeſwik</hi> mentions this to have been a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor belonging to the biſhop of <hi>Lichfield;</hi> which I find was alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the king by biſhop <hi>Sampſon,</hi> in 1547.</p>

                  <note place="margin">LONGDON.</note> The church lies out of the road, on the left; is a vicarage, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>James;</hi> and belongs to a prebendſhip of <hi>Lichfield.</hi> The village conſiſts of ſcattered houſes, extending for a vaſt way on each ſide of the lane; from whence the name. This gave riſe, to a common ſaying in theſe parts,

               </p>
               <p>THIS village antiently was full of gentlemen's ſeats; a moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpecies of population to the poor, whoſe diſtreſſes ſeldom fail reaching the ears of mediocrity, but whoſe cries rarely attain the height of greatneſs. Sir <hi>Edward Littleton</hi> had a houſe called <hi>Cheſtal; Simon Rudgley,</hi> ſheriff of the county in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. had another; the younger brother of the <hi>Aſtons</hi> had a ſeat here, from the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> I; the <hi>Broughtons</hi> had <hi>Broughton Hall,</hi> from the days of King <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>Adam Arblaſter</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Liſwys</hi> (now <hi>Longball</hi>) in 1351, or the twenty-fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> III. in whoſe name it continued till of late, when it was purchaſed by <hi>Francis Cob,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>THIS manor is of vaſt extent. Above thirty other manors, lordſhips) and villages, owe ſuit and ſervice, beſides <hi>Cank, Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and <hi>Rudgley,</hi> to the court-leet, which is held here every

three weeks. It once belonged to the biſhop of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> but was alienated by Biſhop <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER winding up the ſteep of a high hill, an advanced part of the foreſt of <hi>Cank,</hi> I turned out of the road to <hi>Beaudeſert,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BEAUDESERT.</note> the princely ſeat of Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> placed on the ſide of a lofty ſloping eminence, ſheltered above, and on each ſide, by beautiful riſing grounds, and emboſomed with trees, commanding in front, over the tops of far ſubjacent woods, a moſt extenſive and agreeable view; ſo that it well vindicates the propriety of its name.</p>
               <p>THIS had been a place belonging to the biſhops of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> which, with the manors of <hi>Longdon, Heywood, Berkſwick, Cank, Rudgley,</hi> and <hi>Shugborrow,</hi> were part of the ſpoils of that ſee, wreſted from it in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. with the connivance of <hi>Richard Sampſon,</hi> then biſhop, who accepted in their ſtead certain impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations of the value of an hundred and eighty-three pounds a year. Theſe livings at that time were good rectories; now poor vicarages, or mercenary curacies, annexed to the biſhoprick.</p>
               <p>THE leviathan who ſwallowed theſe manors, was Sir <hi>William Paget,</hi> created by <hi>Edward</hi> VI. Baron <hi>Beaudeſert.</hi> He firſt appeared in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and from a low beginning, merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly roſe to the dignity of ſecretary and ambaſſador to <hi>Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. In the next reign, he was made chancellor of the dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and comptroller of the houſhold; and obtained a peerage. In that of <hi>Mary,</hi> became lord privy-ſeal, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the order of the Garter, from which he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded in the time of her predeceſſor. At the acceſſion of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> at his own requeſt, he was permitted to retire from the ſervice of the ſtate, being zealouſly attached to the religion of his

                     <hi>Fuller's Worthies,</hi> 210.</note>. Yet his zeal for the old religion, produced in him no ſcruples about ſharing in the plunder of the church. The reforming <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and the papal <hi>Paget,</hi> agreed in that ſingle point. His poſterity derive from him an uncommon extent of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beaudeſert</hi> was rebuilt by <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> It is a very handſome ſtone edifice, in form of an half H; of late moſt admirably improved, and fitted up by the noble owner. It is totally diſengaged from the gateway, walls, and other obſtructions that encumbered it in the days of <hi>Plott;</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See his plate viii. p. 126.</note> and the grounds that environ it are layed with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that forms true grandeur.</p>
               <p>HERE is a gothic hall of eighty feet by twenty-one; a dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room of forty-two by twenty-ſeven; and a magnificent gallery of ninety-ſeven by ſeventeen. The other apartments are ſmall.</p>
               <p>IN the drawing-room is a fine portrait of the founder of the family,<note place="margin">PORTRAIT OF LORD PAGET.</note> the firſt Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> a three-quarters length; in a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, black gown furred, with a great forked beard, the George, a ſtick, and dagger.

               </p>

               <p>AFTER a ſhort ride, I reached the ſummit of a long but gentle deſcent, from which is a fine view of the city of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> lying at the foot of it. The ſituation is delightful, in a fertile and dry ſoil, with ſmall riſings on almoſt every ſide. The cathedral, with its three ſpires, is a moſt ſtriking object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lichfield</hi> is a place of <hi>Saxon</hi> origin, <note place="margin">LICHFIELD.</note> and owes its riſe to <hi>Ceadda,</hi> or <hi>Chad,</hi> the great ſaint of <hi>Mercia.</hi> I omit the legend of the thouſand Chriſtians, diſciples of St. <hi>Amphibolus,</hi> that were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred here under <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> or the three kings ſlain at this place in battle, as ſculptured over the-town-hall. I take up its hiſtory about the year 656, when <hi>Oſwy,</hi> king of the country, eſtabliſhed a biſhoprick here, and made <hi>Dwina,</hi> or <hi>Dinma,</hi> the firſt prelate. To him ſucceeded <hi>Cellach</hi> and <hi>Trumberct;</hi> and on his demiſe,<note place="margin">ST.

In this place he was diſcovered by <hi>Rufine,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Wolphere,</hi> who was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, inſtructed by him till the time of his martyrdom, before-recited. Remorſe, and conſequential converſion, ſeized the Pagan prince. As ſome ſpecies of expiation, he preferred the apoſtle to the vacant ſee. He built himſelf a ſmall houſe near the church, and, with ſeven or eight of his brethren, during the interval of preaching, read and prayed in private. On the approach of his death, flights of angels, ſang hymns over his cell. Miracles at

                  <hi>Ceadda</hi> was of courſe canonized; a ſhrine was erected in honor of him; great was the concourſe of devotees: the place increaſed and flouriſhed.</p>
               <p>THE hiſtory of our cathedrals is; in its beginning, but the his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of ſuperſtition, mixed with ſome truth and abundance of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend: humiliating proof of the weakneſs of the human mind! yet all the fine arts of paſt times, and all the magnificent works we now ſo juſtly admire, are owing to a ſpecies of piety that every lover of the elegance of architecture muſt rejoice to have exiſted.</p>
               <p>WE are told, that in the days of <hi>Jaruman,</hi> about the year 666, <note place="margin">CATHEDRAL WHEN FOUNDED.</note> the cathedral was founded.</p>

AFTER a ſucceſſion of twelve prelates, <hi>Walter de Langton,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">BISHOP LANGTON</note> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of <hi>England,</hi> was conſecrated biſhop of this ſee, in 1296. He was highly favored by <hi>Edward</hi> I. His proſperity was interrupted by the reſentment of the prince, who meanly revenged on the biſhop a ſhort impriſonment he had ſuffered in the time of his father, for riotouſly deſtroying his deer. After a perſecution and confinement of above two years, he emerged from all his difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reſumed his paſtoral charge in a manner that did him great honor. He may be conſidered as the third architect of this cathedral: to him we are indebted for the preſent elegant pile. He laid the foundation for our Lady's chapel; an edifice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common beauty, finiſhed after his death with money left for that purpoſe. He built the cloyſters, and expended £2,000 upon a ſhrine for St. <hi>Chad.</hi> He beſtowed on the choir ſeveral rich veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a chalice, and two cups of beaten gold, to the value of £200. To the vicars choral he gave a ſtanding cup, and an annual penſion of £20, and procured for them and the canons great immunities: in particular, there was an order from the king to the juſtices of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> that, without trial, they ſhould hang upon the next gallows divers perſons that by force kept their lands from them. This prelate alſo ſurrounded the cloſe with a wall and ditch, made the great gate at the weſt end, and the poſtern at the ſouth. He gave his own palace, at the weſt end of the cloſe, to the vicars choral, and built a new one for himſelf at the eaſt end. He partly built, or enlarged, the caſtle at <hi>Eccleſhal,</hi> and the manors of <hi>Heywood</hi> and <hi>Shugborow,</hi> and the palace in the <hi>Strand.</hi> He finiſhed his uſeful life in <hi>November</hi> 1321, and was buried in the chapel of his own founding.</p>
               <p>THE cathedral continued in the ſtate it was left by Biſhop

                  <hi>Langton,</hi> till the time of the diſſolution, when the rich ſhrine of St. <hi>Chad,</hi> and other objects of ſimilar devotion, fell a prey to the rapacity of the prince. The building continued in its priſtine beauty till the unhappy wars of the laſt century, <note place="margin">CATHEDRAL FORTIFIED.</note> when it ſuffered greatly by three ſieges. The ſituation of the place on an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſurrounded by water and by deep ditches, and fortified with walls and baſtions, rendered it unhappily a proper place for a garriſon.</p>
               <p>IN 1643, it was poſſeſſed by the royaliſts of the county, under the Earl of <hi>Cheſterfield:</hi> when it underwent the attack rendered memorable by the death of Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> commander of the parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary forces. His lordſhip, in reconnoitring the cathedral, in a wooden porch in <hi>Dams ſtreet,</hi> was ſhot into the eye by a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ball, on <hi>March</hi> 2d, 1643. This happened to be the feſtival of St. <hi>Chad,</hi> the patron of the church. The cavaliers attributed the direction of the fatal bullet to the influence of the Saint, in reſentment of the ſacrileges this nobleman was committing on his cathedral.

He died in 1670. A very handſome tomb was erected in the choir to his memory, with his effigies laid recumbent on it, with a mitre on his head, and in his epiſcopal dreſs.</p>
               <p>THE weſt front is of great elegance, adorned with the richeſt ſculpture, and, till of late, with rows of ſtatues of prophets, kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> &amp;c. and, above all, a very bad one of <hi>Charles</hi> II. who had contributed to the repair of the church, by a liberal gift of timber.

               <p>THE roof was till of late covered with lead, but grew ſo greatly out of repair, that the dean and chapter were obliged to ſubſtitute ſlates inſtead of metal, on account of the narrow revenues left to maintain this venerable pile; and, after the ſtricteſt oeconomy, they will be under the neceſſity of contributing from their own income, in order to complete their plan. The excellent order that all the cathedrals I have viſited are in, does great credit to their members; who ſpare nothing from their own incomes to render them not only decent, but elegant.</p>

               <p>THE choir merits attention, <note place="margin">CHOIR.</note> on account of the elegant ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about the windows, and the embattled gallery that runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them.

THE prebendal houſes are built around the cloſe. The whole property is in the church, except two houſes on the ſouth ſide, bordering on the pool, which, before the preſent cauſeways were made, were granted to the city, that the inhabitants might have landing-places, and acceſs to the cathedral; which in old times had a vaſt concourſe of devotees to the ſhrine of St. <hi>Chad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS precinct is ſupplied with water from <hi>Maple Hay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">WATER.</note> about a mile and a half to the north; two fountains having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the church by <hi>Thomas Bromley,</hi> for ever, on the annual payment of 15<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> I find that this donation was made before 1293; for in that year a diſpute aroſe between the dean and chapter, and <hi>Thomas de Abbenhale,</hi> about the paſſage of the water through his lands <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Greene</hi>'s MSS.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE whole cloſe is of exempt juriſdiction, <note place="margin">MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH.</note> and quite indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the city. Its members are, a dean, precentor, chancellor, and treaſurer, who have prebends annexed to their offices. There are twenty-ſeven other prebends, of which that of <hi>Eccleſhal</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the biſhoprick. Out of theſe thirty-one, the dean and four more are ſtiled canons reſidentiary; which four are choſen out of the prebendaries and dignitaries. Here are twelve minor canons: five of whom are called prieſt-vicars; the other ſeven, lay-vicars, or ſinging-men. Both theſe were formerly collegiated, and had their hall and houſes. That of the prieſt-vicars is a handſome room, rebuilt, and uſually is lent for the purpoſes of aſſemblies, and other amuſements. A new houſe alſo ſtands on the ground once occupied by the houſe of the choriſters: before it ſtood, within memory, a very pretty gate, which formed the entrance; on which was inſcribed <hi>Domus Choriſtes.</hi>

BESIDES theſe members, are an organiſt, two vergers, a ſacriſt, and ſub-ſacriſt. It is remarkable, that the four archdeacons have here no ſtalls, as is uſual in all other cathedrals.</p>
               <p>THE other churches are that of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ST. MARY'S</note> rebuilt ſince the year 1716, when, the body being ruinous, its fine ſpire ſteeple was unneceſſarily pulled down.

This, and that of <hi>Stow,</hi> or St. <hi>Chad</hi>'s, are curacies dependent on St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s. St. <hi>Chad</hi>'s is reckoned the oldeſt of the churches of this city. In its north end formerly ſtood the ſhrine of St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> whoſe chauntry-prieſt had his ſtipend from the vicars-choral of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral. Near it is the well of the faint, where he had his firſt oratory; which in antient times was much frequented by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees.</p>
               <p>THE grey friars had a houſe here, <note place="margin">GREY FRIARS.</note> founded about 1229, by Biſhop <hi>Alexander,</hi> who gave certain free burgages, on which it was erected. It was deſtroyed by fire in 1291, but rebuilt in the thirty-ſixth of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. It was granted to <hi>Richard Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blethorn.</hi> At preſent, both houſe and land ſupport an hoſpital at <hi>Seal,</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> The water which now ſupplies the city, was granted, on St. <hi>James</hi>'s day, in 1301, by <hi>Henry Campanarius,</hi> ſon of <hi>Michael de Lichfield,</hi> bell-founder. <hi>Henry</hi> gave his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

at <hi>Foulwel,</hi> near <hi>Alreſchaw,</hi> in pure and perpetual alms to the friars of this houſe, with power to cover them with a head of ſtones, and of carrying the pipes through his land, on condition that, whenever they wanted repair, the friars were to indemnify him and his heirs for the damage done to the ground. Several parts of the houſe are yet ſtanding, and form a pleaſant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable habitation. In digging near it, was found a large tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, with a croſs fleury, ſurrounded by a ſingular inſcription, to the following purpoſe:

               <p>AMONG other things worthy of attention in this city, is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of curioſities, antient, natural, and artificial, in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mr. <hi>Greene,</hi> ſurgeon. It contains numbers of moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inſtructive pieces in each claſs. A viſit to my worthy friend is the more agreeable, as he takes great pleaſure in gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curioſity of all that favor him with their company.</p>
               <p>THE city is divided from the cloſe by a large piece of water, <note place="margin">CITY.</note> originally three; at preſent remain only this and another, called <hi>Stowpool,</hi> a little to the eaſt. Biſhop <hi>Langton</hi> made the cauſeway, bridges, and dams, at each end of the pool. Before that, the great road went round <hi>Stowpool,</hi> near <hi>Stow</hi> church. The city is neat, and well built; contains little more than three thouſand ſouls; is a place of great paſſage, has a conſiderable manufacture of ſail-cloth, and a ſmall manufacture of ſaddle-cloths and tammies.</p>
               <p>IT was originally governed by a guild and guild-maſter; <note place="margin">HOW GOVERNED.</note> which were the origin of corporations, and took riſe before the time of the Conqueſt; the name being <hi>Saxon,</hi> ſignifying a fraternity, which unites and flings its effects into a common ſtock, and is derived

A guild was a public feaſt, to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the time of the inſtitution; and the guild-hall the place in which the fraternity aſſembled: Theſe (at leſt after the Conqueſt) paid fines to the crown, and formed part of its revenue. <hi>Richard</hi> I. enabled it to purchaſe lands to the value of ten pounds; but it was not chartered till the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. who formed it into a regular corporation by its firſt charter. This was confirmed by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> II. granted a new one, confirming all the others.</p>
               <p>IT is governed by a recorder, high ſteward, ſheriff, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, and coroner. One of the bailiffs is elected by the biſhop; the others to be elected annually by and out of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which form the corporation. The city has power of life and death within their juriſdiction; a court of record; and a pie-powder <note n="†" place="bottom">So called from <hi>pier poudreux,</hi> or duſty feet, becauſe country people uſually come with duſty ſhoes to fairs.

               <p>THE diſtrict of the city and county of <hi>Lichfield</hi> is called the ſheriff's ride, <note place="margin">DISTRICT.</note> and lies at unequal diſtances around. In this the corporation has excluſive juriſdiction.</p>

the martyrdom of the thouſand Chriſtians, in the tenth perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſaid to have happened. This is aſſerted by <hi>John Roſs,</hi> a <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> antiquary, who died in 1491, near twelve hundred years after the event; which he alone relates.</p>

               <p>I MADE one day an excurſion in ſearch of the ſeven <hi>Tumuli,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TUMULI.</note> which are ſaid, in the firſt volume of the <hi>Archaeologia,</hi> p. 57, to be near this town.

I paſſed through <hi>Whittington,</hi> a village with a church and ſpire-ſteeple, about two miles N.

I forded the river, and went by <hi>Elford Low,</hi> a verdant mount, which Doctor <hi>Plott</hi> proved, from examination, to have been ſepulchral; but, from its ſituation and elevation, I ſuſpect it might have had on it a <hi>ſpecula,</hi> or watch-tower; and that all the others might have been for the ſame uſe, and to repeat ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in time of danger <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Vegelius,</hi> Not. ad lib. iii. 307.</note>.</p>

his poſterity was ſeiſed of it till the marriage of <hi>Maud,</hi> ſole heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of Sir <hi>John Arderne,</hi> with <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſecond ſon of Sir <hi>John Stanley</hi> of <hi>Latham,</hi> Knight; he dying in 1463, the 6th of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> IV. <hi>Margaret,</hi> his daughter, conveyed it by marriage to the <hi>Stantons:</hi> by the ſame means it paſſed from the <hi>Stantons</hi> to the <hi>Smiths;</hi> from the <hi>Smiths</hi> to the <hi>Huddleſtons,</hi> and from the <hi>Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons</hi> to the <hi>Bowes.</hi> So very rapid was the change of family in this place!

In the church is a tomb, with the effigies of Sir <hi>John Vernon</hi> of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſton,</hi> in this neighborhood, and Dame <hi>Allen,</hi> his wife.

By the marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> daughter and heireſs of Sir <hi>Clement Fiſher,</hi> Baronet, with <hi>Heneage,</hi> ſecond Earl of <hi>Ailsford,</hi> the place was transferred to that noble family. The ſituation has of late years been highly improved by the change of the road. The grounds are prettily ſloped by nature, are well wooded, and the bottom filled with two pleaſing pieces of water. The houſe has alſo undergone many alterations; is a plain convenient building; except on one ſide, where opens a <hi>loggio</hi> (in our climate) moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably adapted for the encouragement of rheums and rheumatiſms.</p>
               <p>WITHIN is a good portrait of its founder, <hi>John Fiſher;</hi> a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length, with a ſquare white beard, cloſe black cap, upright ruff, and black jacket.</p>
               <p>A BEAUTIFUL picture of <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> conſort to <hi>Charles</hi> I. She is repreſented ſitting, in blue, with roſes in her hand, and her thorny crown by her.</p>
               <p>HERE is alſo a portrait of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> in his robes, father to the Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Ailsford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE country here begins to loſe the comforts of a gravelly ſoil, and changes to the wet-retaining clay. At the pleaſant village of <hi>Mireden</hi> it is uncommonly deep, <note place="margin">MIREDEN.</note> but by the aſſiſtance of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes become an excellent road. The pretty houſes on each ſide of the way, and the magnificent inn, famed for time immemorial for its excellent malt-liquor, with the various embelliſhments (made by the old inn-keeper, <hi>Reynolds</hi>) of gateway, little ponds, ſtatues, and other whims, enliven the ſpot greatly.</p>
               <p>THE church is ſeated a little higher up, <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> on an eminence. Within is a handſome alabaſter tomb of <hi>John Wyard,</hi> in armour and mail, with ſword and dagger by his ſide; his arms a cinquefoil on his breaſt. This gentleman had been 'ſquire (as the inſcription re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0369200900:154"/>
to <hi>Thomas de Beauchamp</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and founder of a chauntry in this church; near which he had his reſidence. He was alſo knight of the ſhire for this county, in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> II.</p>
               <p>HERE is another tomb, with a figure in ſtone, ſuppoſed to have been that of one of the <hi>Walſhes,</hi> the antient lords of this manor. His figure, as well as the former, is recumbent, with their hands in the action of ſupplication: but this gentleman has a ſhort ſkirt over the lower part of his armour.</p>
               <p>THE antient name of this place was <hi>Alſpath,</hi> or <hi>Aileſpede,</hi> even till the beginning of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI; about which time, becoming a great thoroughfare, it got the name of <hi>Myreden; den</hi> ſignifying a bottom, and <hi>myre,</hi> dirt: and I can well vouch for the propriety of the appellation, before the inſtitution of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes.</p>
               <p>IN <hi>March</hi> 1739-40, I changed my <hi>Welſh</hi> ſchool for one nearer to the capital, <note place="margin">OLD FASHION OF TRAVELLING.</note> and travelled in the <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſtage; then no deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable vehicle for country gentlemen.

The ſtrain and labor of ſix good horſes, ſometimes eight, drew us through the ſloughs of <hi>Mireden,</hi> and many other places. We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly out two hours before day, and as late at night; and in the depth of winter proportionably later.</p>
               <p>Families which travelled in their own carriages, contracted with <hi>Benſon</hi> and Co. and were dragged up in the ſame number of days, by three ſets of able horſes.</p>

THE ſingle gentlemen, then a hardy race, equipped in jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boots and trowſers, up to their middle, rode poſt through thick and thin, and, guarded againſt the mire, defied the frequent ſtumble and fall; aroſe and purſued their journey with alacrity: while in theſe days their enervated poſterity ſleep away their rapid journies in eaſy chaiſes, fitted for the conveyance of the ſoft inhabitants of <hi>Sybaris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I CONTINUED my way to <hi>Coventry</hi> through <hi>Alleſey,</hi>

               <p>AFTER a ride of two miles from hence, <note place="margin">COVENTRY.</note> I entered <hi>Coventry,</hi> a great and antient city. The time of its foundation is unknown.

               <p>THE certainty of there having been a convent here in the early times, <note place="margin">SAXON NUNNERY.</note> depends on the authority of <hi>John Rous</hi>

               <p>ON its ruins, <hi>Leofric,</hi> fifth earl of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and his counteſs <hi>Godeva,</hi> founded a monaſtery. At that period <hi>Coventry</hi> muſt have been a conſiderable place, and its number of inhabitants great, otherwiſe the fair <hi>Godeva</hi> could never have made ſo great a merit of riding naked through the town, <note place="margin">STORY OF GODEVA.</note> to redeem it from the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable taxes and grievances it at that time labored under. The cauſe muſt have been equal to the deed. Her huſband long reſiſted her importunity in its behalf, on account of the profits that accrued to him: at length thought to ſilence her by the ſtrange propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal: ſhe accepted it, and, being happy in fine flowing locks, rode, decently covered to her very feet with her lovely treſſes. The hiſtory was preſerved in a picture, about the time of <hi>Richard</hi> II. in which were portrayed the earl and counteſs. He holds a charter of freedom in his hand, and thus addreſſes his lady:

               <p>Legend ſays, that previous to her ride, all the inhabitants were ordered, on pain of death, to ſhut themſelves up during the time; but that the curioſity of a certain taylor, overcoming fear, took a ſingle peep; which is commemorated even at preſent, by a figure looking out of a wall in the great ſtreet.

                  <note place="margin">INCORPORATED.</note> and became more immediately the object of royal favor. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> III. in the eighteenth of his reign, by letters dated the 20th of <hi>January,</hi> made it a corporation, conſiſting of a mayor and two bailiffs, whom the inhabitants were to chuſe out of themſelves.

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> VI. in 1451, beſtowed on this city a very particular mark of his affection, by erecting it, with a conſiderable diſtrict around,<note place="margin">MADE A COUNTY.</note> into a county<note n="†" place="bottom">Accurately laid down in Mr. <hi>Beighton</hi>'s map of <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi>

               <p>AMONG all its privileges, unfortunately for the magiſtrates, it has that of life and death.</p>
               <p>Two parlements have been held in this city,<note place="margin">PARLEMENTS HELD HERE.</note> in the great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the priory. The firſt, in 1404, by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. which was ſtiled <hi>Parliamentum indoctorum;</hi> not that it conſiſted of a greater number of blockheads than parlements ordinarily do, but from its inveteracy againſt the clergy, whoſe revenues it was determined not to ſpare: whence it was alſo called the <hi>Laymen's Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               <p>THE trade of this city was originally the manufacture of cloth, <note place="margin">TRADE, CLOTH.</note> and caps, or bonnets <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Anderſon's Dict.</hi> i. 262.</note>, which aroſe to a great degree of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as early as 1436, and continued till the laſt century, when it was changed for the worſted buſineſs; and, for a long time, the making and ſale of ſhags, camblets, laſtings, tammies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I MUST remark, that in the beginning, or middle, <note place="margin">BLUE THREAD.</note> of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, <hi>Coventry</hi> had a vaſt manufacture of blue thread; which was loſt before the year 1581 <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Anderſon's Dict.</hi> i 422.</note>. So famous was it for its dye, that <hi>true as Coventry blue</hi> became proverbial.</p>
               <p>ABOUT eighty years ago, <note place="margin">RIBANDS.</note> the ſilk manufacture of ribands was introduced here, and, for the firſt thirty years, remained in the hands of a few people, who acquired vaſt fortunes; ſince which, it has extended to a great degree, and is ſuppoſed to employ at left ten thouſand people; and has likewiſe ſpread into the neighboring towns, ſuch as <hi>Nuneaton,</hi> and other places. Such real good reſults from our little vanities!</p>
               <p>THERE are about a dozen traders in <hi>Coventry,</hi> who have houſes in <hi>London;</hi> to which they ſend up weekly great quantities of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; and, before our unhappy breach with <hi>America,</hi> a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive trade was carried on with the colonies: but the home-conſumption has been always reckoned moſt material.

THE military tranſactions of this city are very few. It was an open town for many centuries, and, of courſe, incapable of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ſiege. The walls were not begun till the year 1355, <note place="margin">WALLS.</note> and then by virtue of a licence granted by <hi>Edward</hi> III. twenty-ſeven years before; nor were they finiſhed in leſs than forty. They were built by money raiſed by taxes, and by cuſtoms on the wine, malt, oxen, hogs, calves, and ſheep, conſumed in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry.</hi> Theſe walls were of great ſtrength and grandeur, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with thirty-two towers and twelve gates. Theſe continued till the 22d of <hi>July</hi> 1661, when great part of the wall, and moſt of the towers, and many of the gates, were pulled down, with certain circumſtances of diſgrace, as a puniſhment for the diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the inhabitants, in ſhutting their gates againſt their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <hi>Charles</hi> I. on the 13th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1642. His majeſty, after ſetting up his ſtandard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> had ſent to this city, to acquaint them that he meant to reſide there for ſome time, and deſired quarters for his forces in and about the place. The mayor and aldermen, with many expreſſions of affection, offered to receive the king, but refuſed admittance to any of the ſoldiery. Incenſed at this, his majeſty attacked the city, <note place="margin">CITY ATTACKED BY CHARLES I.</note> and with his ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance forced open one of the gates; but was repulſed by the valour of the citizens, and obliged to retire with loſs <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I SHOULD have mentioned before, that in the fifteenth century another monarch had been denied the poſſeſſion of this city. The great Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> armed it againſt <hi>Edward</hi> IV. in 1470,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0369200900:161"/>
when he attempted entering on the ſide of <hi>Gosford Green.</hi> The king amply repaid the inſult on the citizens, who perhaps acted by conſtraint. He deprived them of their privileges, and made them pay five hundred marks for the recovering of them, by having the ſword reſtored to them.</p>
               <p>BEFORE the building of the walls, <note place="margin">CASTLE.</note> there had been, from very early times, a caſtle on the ſouth ſide of the town, near <hi>Chyleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> with a park belonging to it. This had been the reſidence of the kings and earls of <hi>Mercia:</hi> it afterwards fell to the earls of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and at length was veſted in the royal line. No veſtige of it is now to be ſeen: in its place is a very antient wooden building, the remains of the manor-houſe of <hi>Chyleſmore,</hi> probably built after the demolition of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>KING <hi>Stephen</hi> forcibly took this fortreſs from <hi>Randle de Gernons</hi> earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The earl, in 1146, attempted to reduce it, not by ſiege, but by erecting a fort near it, in order to diſtreſs the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, by cutting off ſupplies. The king twice attempted its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; the firſt time without ſucceſs, but in the ſecond action he defeated the earl; forced him to fly, covered with wounds; <note place="margin">DEMOLISHED.</note> and then demoliſhed the caſtle <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <note place="margin">CHURCH OF ST.

This church was originally a chapel to the merchants gild, the moſt antient in <hi>Coventry,</hi> licenſed by <hi>Edward</hi> III. in 1340, for a fraternity of brethren and ſiſters, with a warden, or maſter, to be elected out of the body; who might make chauntries, beſtow alms, and do other works of piety; conſtitute ordinances, and purchaſe lands to the value of £20 a year, within the liberty of the city, for the founding of a chauntry of ſix prieſts, to ſing maſs every day in the churches of the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> and St. <hi>Michael,</hi> for the ſoul of king <hi>Edward,</hi> queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> their children, and for the ſouls of the gild, and others. Soon after, <hi>Iſabel,</hi> queen-mother, aſſigned the land on this ſpot, then called <hi>Bablake,</hi> for the building a chapel, in which maſſes were to be ſung daily for the ſame purpoſes; which was finiſhed and dedicated in 1350. At length, in 1399, licence was given for celebrating divine ſervice here, provided it might be done without injury to the mother-church <note n="*" place="bottom">

The church has of late years

               <p>BEHIND this church is <hi>Bablake</hi> hoſpital, <note place="margin">BABLAKE HOSPITAL.</note> an old building, with a court in the middle: one part is occupied by <hi>Bond</hi>'s alms-houſes, founded in 1506, by <hi>Thomas Bond,</hi> mayor of <hi>Coventry</hi> in 1497, for ten poor men and one poor woman, with a prieſt to pray for the ſoul of the founder, his grandfather, father, and all Chriſtian ſouls. At that time the revenues were £49. 11<hi>s.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi> In the firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> VIth's time, they were veſted in the city; and, the revenues being improved, at preſent they maintain eighteen old men and a nurſe, each of whom have three ſhillings a week, a black gown, and other emoluments <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dugd. W.</hi> i. 193.</note>. About the year 1619, an infernal ambition of becoming chief of the houſe, ſeized one of the alms-men; who, to attain his end, poiſoned eight of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; five of whom inſtantly died. On detection, the wretch effected his own deſtruction by the ſame method, and was buried with the uſual marks of infamy. Had his fortune flung him into a higher ſtation, his deeds would have paralleled him with <hi>Ceſar Borgia,</hi> or his more monſtrous father, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI.</p>
               <p>THE other part of the building is allotted for the blue boys: a foundation owing to a very ſingular accident. Mr. <hi>Thomas Wheatly,</hi> mayor of <hi>Coventry</hi> in 1556, and ironmonger and card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker by trade, ſent his ſervant, <hi>Oughton,</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> to buy ſome barrels of ſteel gads; which he thought he did, in open fair. When they were brought home and examined, they were found to contain cochineal and ingots of ſilver. Mr. <hi>Wheatly</hi> kept them for a conſiderable time, in hopes of diſcovering the owner;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0369200900:167"/>
for his ſervant did not know from whom he bought them. At length he applied the profits, as well as much of his own eſtate, for the ſupport of poor children.</p>

               <p>AT the lower end of this ſtreet is the free-ſchool: it ſprung out of an hoſpital, <note place="margin">FREE SCHOOL.</note> founded in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> II. by <hi>Laurence,</hi> prior of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and his convent, at the requeſt of <hi>Edmund,</hi> archdeacon of <hi>Coventry,</hi> for the reception of the ſick and needy.

who had large ſhare in the plunder of the church, and having neither wife or child, converted this foundation, which he had purchaſed at a very cheap rate, into a free ſchool, and endowed it with CC marks a year in land. At firſt, the boys were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the church of the <hi>White Friers;</hi> but the magiſtrates finding that Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> had bought the lands but not the church, took advantage of the flaw, and removed the ſcholars to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place, and pulled down the church <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>AT a ſmall diſtance without the <hi>Priory Gate,</hi> is <hi>Swanſwell Pool,</hi> which ſupplies the city with water. This did belong to the priory, but was at the diſſolution purchaſed by the corporation from the crown <note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>FROM hence I returned to the priory, <note place="margin">PRIORY.</note> ſeated on the ſouth ſide of the brook <hi>Sherburn.</hi> What bears that name is an uninhabited houſe, of much later date than that monaſtery; but built on ſome part of the ſite of this great foundation.</p>
               <p>ABOUT the year 1043, earl <hi>Leofric</hi> and his fair counteſs more than repaired the loſs in 1016, in the deſtruction of the famous
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0369200900:169"/>
                  <hi>Saxon</hi> nunnery, by founding in its ſtead a magnificent monaſtery. They placed here an abbot, and twenty-four monks of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine</hi> order; enriched the very walls and the church with maſſy gold and ſilver, and endowed it with half the town and twenty-four manors. All this they did with the advice of king <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor and the reigning pope, and dedicated the church to the honor of God and his bleſſed mother, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Oſburg,</hi> and all ſaints. The pious founders were buried, according to the cuſtom of the times, in the porches; for the diſtaſteful cuſtom of church interment did not prevale till long after.</p>
               <p>THE firſt abbot was <hi>Leofrin;</hi> but that dignity was of ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for, on the removal of the ſee of <hi>Lichfield</hi> to this place, in 1095, by <hi>Robert de Limiſie,</hi> the office was ſuppreſſed, the biſhop being in ſuch caſes always eſteemed ſupreme of the houſe <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Willis's Abbeys,</hi> i. 70.</note> in his ſtead; a prior was appointed, but without derogating from the honor of the houſe; for the priors were barons in parlement as well as the preceding abbots, and the place a mitred abbey. This firſt prelate was more attracted by the wealth of the houſe than by any ſpiritual call; for he at once ſcraped from a ſingle beam five hundred marks worth of ſilver, in order to carry on the intrigue at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the poor monks. He reduced them to ſuch ſhort commons, that he depreſſed their ſpirits, diſcouraged all ſorts of knowlege among them, and, in ſhort, rendered them too dejected to think of obtaining any redreſs.</p>
               <p>THIS was a prelude to greater misfortunes. In the latter end of the following century, <hi>Hugh Novani,</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> became biſhop. He ſoon fell at variance with the monks; who, in a ſynod held
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0369200900:170"/>
before the high altar, doubtleſs on ſome high provocation, broke his head with the holy croſs.
<q>Tantaene animis caeleſtibus irae!</q>
               </p>
               <p>This enraged the proud prelate (as he was called by thoſe meek monks) to lay his complaint againſt them at <hi>Rome.</hi> The pope attended to it, expelled the antient inhabitants, and placed in their room a ſet of ſecular canons. The monks, now driven into the wild world, had only the ſatisfaction of ſeeing their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor ſtruck with deep remorſe; for, in 1198, lying on his death-bed, in the abbey of <hi>Bec,</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he was ſeized with fierce horrors at his conduct towards thoſe holy men; implored forgiveneſs, and deſired their interceſſion with the Almighty in his behalf. He requeſted to be buried in the habit of the order, that he might receive the benefit of its protection in the other world, and finally conſigned himſelf to purgatory, <hi>ibi in diem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii cruciandus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LUCKILY at the time of this event, <hi>Thomas,</hi> a monk of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> happened to be at <hi>Rome</hi> ſoliciting the cauſe of his brethren: he ſo enraged <hi>Innocent</hi> III. (then pope) by his importunities, as to order him to withdraw. The poor monk, with tears, replied, <q>Another pope will come, to whom I ſhall not ſue in vain. I therefore will patiently wait your death, as I have that of your two predeceſſors.</q> "Here is a devil of a fellow" (ſays his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in high wrath, to his attendants) <q>by St. <hi>Peter!</hi> He ſhall not wait for my death; ſo I will not put him off any longer, but make out the purpoſe of his petition before I put a morſel more into my mouth <note n="*" place="bottom">

THIS troubleſome affair ended, they were replaced with double advantage; their privileges, as if by way of atonement for their ſhort ſufferings, increaſed beyond all reaſon; for in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. they obtained, that they and their tenants, except thoſe who held by knight ſervice more than half a knight's ſee, ſhould be quit of murder, robbery, ſuit to the county or hundred courts, aid to the ſheriffs, view of frankpledge, and repair of the king's caſtles or pools <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>BUT even this arm had not power to ward off the blow given by the more irreſiſtible one of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII; who, not content with the expulſion of its inhabitants, and ſeizure of the revenues, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected this noble pile to be levelled with the ground; which he did, notwithſtanding the earneſt prayers of its biſhop, <hi>Rowland Lee,</hi> one of his moſt ſervile tools.

THE loſs is the more to be regretted, as this cathedral is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been built on the model of that of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and equally beautiful. Nothing remains except a fragment, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting part of a private houſe, to be ſeen with difficulty, and after ſome ſearch. The palace ſtood between the priory and Saint <hi>Michael</hi>'s, and was ſold in 1651, for its materials, to <hi>Nathaniel Lacy</hi> and <hi>Obadiah Chambers,</hi> for the ſum of an hundred guineas. The laſt prior, <hi>Thomas Camſel,</hi> in 1538, was prevaled on to make a ſurrender of the houſe, either through fear of death, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the tyrant's pleaſure, or through lucre of penſion; for he had not leſs than £133. 6<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> annuity, beſides other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances to the monks <note n="*" place="bottom">

IN king <hi>Stephen</hi>'s time, this church was a chapel to the monks; became afterwards a vicarage, and on the diſſolution fell to the gift of the crown. This, <hi>Trinity,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi>'s, form the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of this great city; ſo numerous are the diſſenters.</p>
               <p>ITS beautiful ſteeple was begun in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. in 1372, by two brothers, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>William Bota,</hi> at their own charges, which amounted annually to one hundred pounds; nor was it finiſhed in leſs than twenty years. By the ſtile of architecture, I agree with Sir <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> that the preſent body was built in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. Some ornament was alſo added to the ſteeple at the ſame time. <hi>Coventry</hi> ſeems to have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly favored by <hi>Henry,</hi> or, to ſpeak more properly of that meek prince, by the heroine <hi>Margaret;</hi> for this city uſed to be ſtiled the ſecret harbour of that queen.</p>
               <p>TRINITY church, and its ſpire, would be ſpoken of as a moſt beautiful building, was it not eclipſed by its unfortunate vicinity to St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s. Within are two epitaphs, which I give for their ſingularity. One is on <hi>Philemon Holland,</hi> the famous tranſlator. He was ſchool-maſter and phyſician in the city. A wag made this diſtich on one of his labors:
<q>
                     <l>Philemon with tranſlations doth ſo fill us,</l>
                     <l>He will not let <hi>Suetonius</hi> be <hi>Tranquillus.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>HE was called tranſlator-general of his age; acquired much credit by his fidelity, but none greater than by his tranſlation of <hi>Cambden,</hi> in that great antiquarian's life-time, and by his conſent; to whoſe work he made conſiderable additions.</p>
               <p>HE wrote a great folio with one pen, and, as he tells us, did not wear it out.

               </p>
               <p>AT length (if I may be allowed to pun with <hi>Fuller</hi>) death tranſlated this tranſlator to the other world, in 1636, at the good old age of eighty-five; leaving behind this epitaph of his own compoſition.</p>

               <p>I SHALL give the conſequence of this important affair in the very graphical words of honeſt <hi>Holinſhed,</hi> who minutely deſcribes the pomp and ceremony preceding the reſolution taken by the unfortunate monarch, which in the end coſt him his crown and life.</p>

                  <q>At the time appointed, the king came to <hi>Coventrie,</hi> where the two dukes were readie, according to the order preſcribed therein; comming thither in great arraie, accompanied with the lords and gentlemen of their linages. The king cauſed a ſumptuous ſcaffold, or theater, and roial liſtes there to be erected and prepared. The <hi>Sundaie</hi> before they ſhould fight, after dinner, the duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> came to the king (being lodged about a quarter of a mile without the town, in a tower that belonged to Sir <hi>William Bagot</hi>) to take his leave of him. The morrow after, being the daie appointed for the combat, about the ſpring of the daie came the duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> to the court, to take leave likewiſe of the king. The duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> armed him in his tent, that was ſet up neere to the liſts; and the duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> put on his armor betwixt the gate and the barrier of the town, in a beautiful houſe, having a fair perclois of wood towards the gate, that none might ſee what was done within the houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The duke of <hi>Aumarle</hi> that daie being high conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> and the duke of <hi>Surrie</hi> marſhal, placed themſelves betwixt them, well armed and appointed. And when they ſaw their time, they firſt entered into the liſts with a great company of men, apparelled in ſilke ſendal, imbrodered with ſilver both richlie and curiouſlie; everie man having a tipped ſtaff, to keep the field in order. About the houre of prime came to the barriers of the liſts the duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> mounted on a white courſer, barded with green and blew velvet, imbroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſumptuouſly with ſwans and antelopes of goldſmiths worke, armed at all points. The conſtable and marſhal came to the barriers, demanding of him what he was? he anſwered,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0369200900:190"/>
'I am <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> duke of <hi>Hereford:</hi> which am come hither to do mine indevor againſt <hi>Thomas Mowbraie</hi> duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> as a traitor untrue to God, the king, his realme, and me.'—Then incontinentlie he ſware upon the holie Evangeliſts, that his quarrel was true &amp; juſt; and upon that point he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to enter the liſts. Then he puts up his ſword, which before he held up naked in his hand, and, putting down his viſor, made a croſs on his horſſe, and with ſpeare in hand entered into the liſts, and deſcended from his horſſe, and ſet him down in a chaire of green velvet, at the one end of the liſts, and there repoſed himſelf, abiding the comming of his adverſarie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Soone after him entered into the field, with great triumph, King <hi>Richard,</hi> accompanied with all the peerſes of the realme; and in his companie was the earle of <hi>Saint Paule,</hi> which was come out of <hi>France,</hi> in poſt, to ſee this challenge performed. The king had there above ten thouſand men in armour, leaſt ſome fraie or tumult might riſe amongſt his nobles, by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling or partaking. When the king was ſet in his ſeat, which was richly hanged and adorned, a king at arms made open proclamation, prohibiting all men, in the name of the king, and of the high conſtable and marſhal, to enterpriſe or attempt to approach, or touch any part of the liſts, upon pain of death, except ſuch as were appointed to order or marſhal the field. The proclamation ended, another herald cried, 'Behold here <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> appelant, which is entered into the liſts roiall, to do his devoir againſt <hi>Thomas Mowbraie</hi> duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> defendant, upon paine to be found falſe &amp; recreant.</q>

                  <q>The duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> hovered on horſſeback at the entrie of the liſts, his horſſe being barded with crimſon velvet, imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered richlie with lions of ſilver and mulberie trees; and when he had made his oth before the conſtable and marſhal, that his quarrel was juſt &amp; true, he entered the field manfullie, ſaieng aloud, 'God, and him that hath the right;' and then he departed from his horſſe, &amp; ſate him downe in his chaire, which was of crimſon velvet, courtined about with white and red damaſke. The lord marſhall viewed their ſpears, to ſee that they were of equall length, and delivered the one ſpeare himſelf to the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and ſent the other unto the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> by a knight; then the herald proclamed, that the traverſes &amp; chaires of the champions ſhould be removed, commanding them, on the king's behalf, to mount on horſſebacke, and addreſs themſelves to the battel and combat <note n="*" place="bottom">

The duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> was not fullie ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when the king caſt downe his warder, and the heralds cried 'Ho, ho.' Then the king cauſed their ſpeares to be taken from them, and commanded them to repaire againe to their chaires; where they remained two long houres, while the king and his councell deliberatlie conſulted what order was beſt to be had in ſo weightie a cauſe. Finallie: after they had deviſed, and fullie determined what ſhould be done therein,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0369200900:192"/>
the heralds cried 'Silence;' and Sir <hi>John Buſhie,</hi> the king's ſecretarie, read the ſentence and determination of the king and his councell, in a long roll; the effect whereof was, that <hi>Henrie</hi> duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> ſhould, within fifteene daies, depart out of the realme, and not to returne before the terme of ten yeares were expired, except by the king he ſhould be repealed againe; and this upon paine of death: and that <hi>Thomas Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braie</hi> duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> bicauſe he had ſowen ſedition in the relme by his words, ſhould likewiſe avoid the realme, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returne againe into <hi>England,</hi> nor approch the borders or confines thereof, upon pain of death: and that the king would ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>When theſe judgements were once read, the king called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him both parties, and made them to ſweare that the one ſhould never come in place where the other was, willinglie, nor keepe any companie togither in any forren region: which oth they both received humblie, and ſo went their waies. The duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> departed ſorrowfullie out of the realme into <hi>Almanie,</hi> and at the laſt came into <hi>Venice,</hi> where he, for thought and melancholie, deceaſſed; for he was in hope (as writers record) that he ſhould have beene borne out in the matter by the king; which, when it fell out otherwiſe, it greeved him not a little. The duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> tooke his leave of the king at <hi>Eltham,</hi> who there releaſed foure yeares of his baniſhment; ſo he tooke his jornie over into <hi>Calis,</hi> and from thence went into <hi>France,</hi> where he remained.</q>

                  <q>A woonder it was to ſee what number of people ran after him, in everie towne and ſtreet where he came, before he tooke the ſea, lamenting and bewailing his departure; as who ſhould ſaie, that when he departed, the onlie ſhield, defenſe, and comfort of the commonwealth was vaded and gone.</q>

               <p>ABOUT two miles from <hi>Coventry,</hi> I croſſed the little river <hi>Sow</hi> at <hi>Binly</hi> bridge, a little beyond which ſtands the beautiful ſmall church of the name, dedicated to St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi>

               <p>NEAR him is his queen, dreſſed in black, and with a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly look. She was the daughter of our peaceful monarch <hi>James</hi> I; who, either through hatred of war, or diſapprobation of his ſon-in-law's ambition, reluctantly undertook his defence, and made, under <hi>Mansfield,</hi> an unfortunate eſſay. His daughter <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> ſupported her unhappy ſituation with uncommon dignity, and ſhewed, amidſt the moſt diſtreſsful poverty, an illuſtrious example of magnanimity. She viſited the army of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> which had in view her huſband's reſtoration, as well as the giving liberty to the <hi>German</hi> Proteſtants. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> volunteers ſeem to have fought her battles, inſpired by love. She was the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the camp, and had votaries among every nation. The young <hi>Craven</hi> was among her warmeſt devotees, and continued his attachment to the laſt moment of her life; poſſeſſed her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved confidence, directed all her affairs, and gave a moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing proof of his eſteem, by building for her uſe, at his eſtate in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> a magnificent palace. The difference of rank alone
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0369200900:197"/>
prevented the publication of their union, which is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have taken place. Her ſpotleſs fame was never aſperſed with improper connection.</p>
               <p>I MUST ſtep to another room, the picture-gallery, for the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of her admirer; a fine head, with the body armed, and croſſed with a ſaſh. Let me finiſh his hiſtory with ſaying, that after the death of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> he retired from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> army into the ſervice of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and, notwithſtanding he never interfered in the civil wars of his own country, yet, in 1650, his eſtates were confiſcated by the parlement (as is ſaid) through falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of favors done the exiled king. On the reſtoration he came over, and in 1670, on the death of the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> he was appointed colonel of the <hi>Coldſtream</hi> regiment of guards. His gallant ſpirit never forſook him: he braved the peſtilence in its greateſt fury, and, with a few other worthies, undertook the care of <hi>London</hi> in 1665, during the deſolation of the plague; and in every fire, was ſo active in preventing the devaſtation of that other ſcourge, that it was ſaid, <q>his very horſe ſmelt it out.</q>

               <p>THIS religious houſe aroſe from the pious intentions of <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> of <hi>Harringworth,</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> who obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in 1381, fourteen acres of land in this place from Sir <hi>Baldwyn Frevile</hi> the elder, determined on that to erect a monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> and endow it with ample revenues. Death prevented the execution; but in his laſt illneſs he left ſixty pounds towards a future eſtabliſhment.</p>

               <p>A SMALL ſpace beyond, the <hi>Roman</hi> foſs-way croſſes the road: <note place="margin">ROMAN ROAD.</note> it enters this county at <hi>High Croſs,</hi> on the verge of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> where it is interſected by the great <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> and traverſes direct to <hi>Stafford upon Foſs,</hi> near the edge of <hi>Gloceſterſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Go over <hi>Dunſmore</hi> heath (now incloſed) and, after riding in a tedious avenue of elms and firs for five miles, reach <hi>Dunchurch,</hi> or the church on the hill; a ſmall village, whoſe church once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the monks of <hi>Pipwell,</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DESCEND the hill, and about three miles further go near <hi>Willoughby,</hi> or the <hi>place of willows;</hi> a little village, <note place="margin">WILLOUGHBY.</note> with a church dedicated to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> formerly appropriated to the hoſpital of St. <hi>John,</hi> without <hi>Eaſt-gate, Oxford;</hi> now in the patronage of <hi>Magdalen College.</hi> This bottom, at preſent enlivened with the windings of the canal, aſſumes a commercial appearance, by the number of new buildings riſing on its banks, and the magazines
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0369200900:204"/>
of coal and limeſtone laid up for ſale. The former gives a moſt comfortable proſpect to the half-ſtarved inhabitants of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire,</hi> by flattering them with the ſpeedy approximation of the means of warmth, and giving to their poor good fuel, inſtead of the wretched ſubſtitute of horſe-dung, which they collect in ſcanty portions for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>IT would be ungrateful to leave <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> without paying a tribute to the memory of Mr. <hi>Henry Beighton,</hi> author of the map of this county, ſurveyed by him in 1722, 23, 24, and 25. As it was the earlieſt, ſo it was the beſt performance of the kind. He had an eſtate of about a hundred a year, in the pariſh of <hi>Coton,</hi> in this county. He aſſiſted his income by ſurveying, in which, for elegance, accuracy, and expedition, he had few equals. He left behind him, in his neighborhood, numbers of excellent ſurveyors, who own him for their maſter. His account of <hi>London</hi> bridge, in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions,</hi> ſhews his ſkill in mechanics. He was interred at <hi>Chilvers Coton;</hi> where a ſmall monument barely tells that he lived and died, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning his merit, neglected by his countrymen during life; for he never met with encouragement to publiſh his admirable map: which was done about the year 1750 <note n="*" place="bottom">He begun his ſurvey in 1725, and finiſhed it in 1729.</note>. by ſubſcription, for the ſupport of his widow.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0369200900:205"/>
of a ſlope, on the left of the road. This is among the few places I neglected to viſit. I muſt therefore ſpeak from Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Twenty-ſix.</note> of its croſs, twenty-four feet high; of the effigy of the Knight Templar in the church; and of the inſtance of the longevity of <hi>William Bren,</hi> of this village, who attained the age of an hundred and twenty-one.</p>
               <p>AFTER the Conqueſt, the <hi>D' Aiencourts</hi> and the <hi>Peverels</hi> held land here. From the laſt it fell, by marriage, to <hi>Albricius de Harcourt;</hi> by his daughter, to <hi>William de Truſſebot,</hi> a man raiſed from a low ſituation, by his deſperate valour, to great eſtates. In the reign of king <hi>Stephen,</hi> being attacked in <hi>Bonville,</hi> of which he was governor, he ſet fire to his own houſe in four places; which ſo terrified the enemy, that they inſtantly evacuated the town.</p>
               <p>BY his daughter <hi>Roeſe,</hi> it fell to <hi>Everard de Roos;</hi> a family who flouriſhed here for ſeveral centuries, a diſtinguiſhed race. One of them, <hi>William,</hi> was clamant to the crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the arbitration of <hi>Edward</hi> I <note n="†" place="bottom">Sir <hi>David Dalrymple's Annals Scotl.</hi> i. 203.</note>. They became extinct in the male line, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. when <hi>Elinor,</hi> eldeſt ſiſter of the laſt Lord <hi>Roos,</hi> conveyed it by marriage to Sir <hi>Robert Manners;</hi> and it was ſold by his deſcendant, <hi>Henry</hi> earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> (who died in 1563) to <hi>Gregory Iſham,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> merchant, a younger ſon of the reſpectable and antient family of that name.</p>
               <p>THE preſent lord of the manor is — <hi>Web,</hi> Eſquire; who keeps in the ſmall manor-houſe a court-leet and baron. <note place="margin">SINGULAR TENURE.</note> The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of a conſiderable portion of land in the pariſh is very ſingular. If a widow appears at the next court after her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's death, and preſents a leathern purſe with a groat in it, ſhe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0369200900:206"/>

               <p>FROM <hi>Dunchurch</hi> the country grows hilly, and till of late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incloſed; pleaſant during the verdure of the young, and the rich yellow of the ripened corn. About three miles from <hi>Braunſton</hi> appears <hi>Daventry,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">DAVENTRY.</note> on the ſide and top of a hill. The place is populous, and carries on a conſiderable manufacture of whips: is an incorporated town, governed by a bailiff, twelve burgeſſes, and a recorder; has two ſerjeants at mace, and one town-clerk. The bailiff for the time is juſtice of the peace, and alſo the year following; and is likewiſe coroner of the inqueſt. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants may arreſt any within their juriſdiction for a ſum under one hundred pounds, and the cauſe is to be decided here. No county juſtice hath power in this place; the juſtices of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough having power of commitment to the county-jail in crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſes. The inhabitants alſo enjoy the privilege of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſerving on juries at the county aſſizes.</p>
               <p>ITS charter is ſaid to have been firſt granted by king <hi>John,</hi> and was renewed by queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The place is of conſiderable antiquity; eſpecially if we give into the derivation of its name, <hi>Dwy Avon tre,</hi> the town of the two <hi>Avons,</hi> or rivers, from its ſituation between them. Certainly it was a place of note at the Conqueſt; had in it ſixteen plough-lands; in the manor three, with three ſlaves, twenty villeyns, a preſbyter, and ten boors, and twelve acres of meadow. It had been worth three pounds: after that event improved to eight.</p>
               <p>THIS was part of the great poſſeſſions of the counteſs <hi>Judith,</hi> niece to the Conqueror, whom he had married to the brave <hi>Waltheof</hi> earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and farther to engage his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0369200900:207"/>
he gave with her this county, and that of <hi>Huntingdon. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theof</hi> unfortunately engaged in a conſpiracy; and, notwithſtanding he repented, and flung himſelf at the king's mercy, was beheaded in 1074, at the inſtigation of his wife <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. It ſeems ſhe had caſt a favorable eye on another perſon: but was diſappointed; for the king offered to her <hi>Simon de Liz,</hi> a noble <hi>Norman,</hi> lame of one leg: him ſhe rejected; which ſo enraged her uncle, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of the two earldoms, and gave them to <hi>De Liz,</hi> with her eldeſt daughter; which obliged <hi>Judith</hi> to a ſtate of peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial widowhood during life.</p>
               <p>HERE are ſome remains of the priory, <note place="margin">PRIORY.</note> inhabited by poor fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. The place is eaſily diſcovered, by ſeveral gothic windows, and a door acceſſible by a great flight of ſteps. Four <hi>Cluniac</hi> monks were originally placed at <hi>Preſton Capes,</hi> in this county, by <hi>Hugh de Leyceſter,</hi> ſheriff of the county, and ſteward to <hi>Maud,</hi> ſiſter to the firſt <hi>S.

               <p>THE pariſh-church had been the conventual: <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> of late years it was handſomely rebuilt; but is no more than a curacy in the gift of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> college. The arms of the college, and of the earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> lord of the manor, grace the eaſt window.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Daventry</hi> I viſited the noted camps on <hi>Borough-hill,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">BOROUGH-HILL.</note> or <hi>Danes-hill,</hi> about a mile ſouth-eaſt of the town. It is lofty and inſulated. The area is of an oblong or oval form, about a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured mile in length, and near two in circumference. The whole is ſurrounded by two, three, or four deep trenches, and the ſame number of great ramparts, or banks; according as the ſtrength or weakneſs of the ground required. Theſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0369200900:209"/>
run on the margin of the hill, and on the ſlope; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the entrance on the eaſtern and weſtern ſides oppoſite to each other.</p>
               <p>WITHIN the area, near the middle, is a bank, which paſſes ſtrait from the weſtern ſide towards the eaſtern: the remainder is deſtroyed. Farther on is the veſtige of another, running paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. Theſe, when entire, would have formed a rectangular camp, by the aſſiſtance of part of the ditches on the ſides of the hill.</p>
               <p>NEAR this camp are ſeveral <hi>tumuli</hi> of the ſepulchral kind; but ſince Mr. <hi>Morton</hi>'s time, their number is evidently leſſened; for in his days, he informs us, there were eighteen.</p>
               <p>THE northern end of the hill is formed into a third camp, of a circular ſhape, and of vaſt ſtrength. Two ditches, of prodigious depth, with ſuitable ramparts, and a deep entrance, croſs the area, and fall into the general ſurrounding ditches, which have been deepened to add to the ſtrength of the third part. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the imperfect remains of another ditch and bank on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, a little ſouth, deſigned to add to the ſecurity.</p>
               <p>ON the north-weſt part of the great rampart of this round camp, is a great mount, either exploratory, or the ſpot where the chieftain pitched his tent.</p>
               <p>I MUST differ with Mr. <hi>Morton</hi> about the makers of the firſt of theſe camps or poſts, which were the <hi>Britons</hi> themſelves. It has every agreement with the multitudes of others ſcattered over the kingdom, and ſuits exactly with the deſcription left by <hi>Tacitus</hi> of the method of defence uſed by our anceſtors, <hi>Tunc montibus arduis, et ſi qua clementer accedi poterunt in modum valli ſaxa praeſtruit.</hi> I

               <p>THIS poſt was in all probability made uſe of when the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Oſtorius</hi> was traverſing this iſland, to quell the commotions he found on his arrival in <hi>Britain.</hi> It is evident, that the <hi>Britons</hi> at this period made uſe of the ſame ſpecies of defence which is proved to have been common to the whole country. The <hi>Iceni</hi> lodged themſelves within a poſt of this kind, againſt this very general <hi>(Locum pugnae delegere ſeptum agreſti aggere et aditu anguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ne pervius equis foret)</hi>

                     <hi>Taciti Annal.</hi> lib. xii. c. 31.</note> but it did not avale. The <hi>Coritani</hi> of theſe parts had recourſe to the ſtrong hold of what I dare ſay they called <hi>Ben Avon,</hi> or the head over the river; one of the ſtreams which form the <hi>Nen,</hi> the river of this country, paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</p>
               <p>THIS poſt proved no obſtacle to the Conqueror; he found it ſit for a ſtation: he contracted its limits eaſt into the ſhape of the camps of his people, and made this a ſummer ſtation, as he did the warm bottom, near the fort, a winter ſtation. Numbers of <hi>Roman</hi> coins found on the ſpots, evince the conjecture. The <hi>Romans,</hi> as is frequently the caſe, latinized the <hi>Britiſh</hi> name, and formed from it their <hi>Benvenna;</hi> which I beg leave to place here, rather than at <hi>Wedon,</hi> a place deſtitute of all claſſical traces.</p>
               <p>I MUST add, that on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of <hi>Borough-hill,</hi> about two or three hundred yards below the ditches, is a leſſer camp, ſurrounded by a foſs and bank. Mr. <hi>Morton</hi> gueſſes it to have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0369200900:211"/>
been the receptacle of the carriages of the greater camp: I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to have been a <hi>proceſtria,</hi> a ſort of free poſt attendant often on camps, where proviſions and other neceſſaries were brought.</p>
               <p>As to the third diviſion of the area of this hill, it is probably <hi>Saxon;</hi> the words <hi>borough, burgh, berry,</hi> and <hi>bury,</hi> being the conſtant appellation left by the <hi>Saxons</hi> to ſimilar places. It is my belief, that every poſt of this nature, occupied by that nation in our iſland, had been originally <hi>Britiſh;</hi> which they altered to their conceptions of ſtrength and defence; which was uſually done by deepening the ditches, raiſing the ramparts, and clearing the area, and often exalting one part into what was called the <hi>dunjeon,</hi> or keep. Theſe places were ſtationary, not properly camps; for the antient <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom theſe invaders were derived, and whoſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms they retained, made uſe of no other defence to their camps than a barrier of waggons, with which they formed the precinct. <hi>Omnes Barbari,</hi> ſays <hi>Vegetius, carris ſuis in orbem connexis ad ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem caſtrorum ſecuras a ſupervenientibus exigunt noctes <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. iii. c. 10.</note>.

               </p>
               <p>EVERY thing on this hill muſt not be attributed to remote an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; for <hi>Charles</hi> I. a few days before the fatal battle of <hi>Naſeby,</hi> occupied this poſt, and fortified it: ſo poſſibly ſome of the entrenchments might be the work of the unfortunate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <note n="‡" place="bottom">

The precinct is about ſix acres, and was moated round. The water that filled the moat was conveyed from pools in <hi>Daventry Park,</hi> a place not remote. Tradition ſays, that within the area ſtood a ſeat of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt;</hi> which is probable, as this manor was once poſſeſſed by the earls and dukes of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> III's time, annexed to that dutchy, and aſſigned to that great duke <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>AFTER the Conqueſt, <hi>Roger de Thebovil</hi> gave a moiety of lands in this monaſtery to the abbey of <hi>Bec,</hi> in <hi>Normandy;</hi> which was, with many other grants to the ſame houſe, confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> II. That abbey afterwards became poſſeſſed of the whole, when it was made dependent on their great cell or priory at <hi>Okeburn,</hi> in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> Vaſt privileges were beſtowed in favor of the monks of this abbey; ſuch as exemption from ſuit and ſervice to the county and hundred courts; from toll paſſage and pontage; and exemption from foreſt laws. They had alſo free warren, and right of determining in murder, manſlaughter, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> all which periſhed at the diſſolution of the priories; and this manor, as part of the poſſeſſions of <hi>Okeburn,</hi> was veſted in the provoſt and fellows of <hi>Eton</hi> college, by <hi>Henry</hi> VI; in which it ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues <note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>FROM hence, I was led by my curioſity about two miles weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <note place="margin">CASTLE DIKES.</note> to <hi>Caſtle Dikes,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Farthingſtone,</hi> remarkable for ſome antient works attributed to the <hi>Saxons.</hi> They are placed on the brow of a ſteep hill, commanding a vaſt view; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo overgrown with thick woods, that I had but a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct ſight of them.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0369200900:215"/>
acres of ground, and to conſiſt of ſtrong holds, divided from each other by a ditch of ſtupendous breadth and depth. A plat, called the <hi>Caſtle-yard,</hi> ſtands to the ſouth-weſt of theſe, entrenched on all ſides but the ſouth-weſt, comprehending about ſeven acres, on which, tradition ſays, a town was ſituated.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Morton</hi> informs us, that a vaulted room, formed of ſquared ſtones, was diſcovered in his time, and beneath that another, which falling in accidentally, a ſmell, reſembling that of putrid carcaſes, iſſued from it. Two or three, rude ſculptures were alſo diſcovered among the rubbiſh.</p>
               <p>IT is conjectured that this place was burnt by the <hi>Danes;</hi> for vaſt maſſes of cinders, mixed with pebbles and clay, have been found in different parts; and many of the ſtones had on them the marks of fire <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Morton,</hi> 543.</note>. There is no account left of the particulars of their ravages; ſo this reſts upon conjecture, as well as the notion of <hi>Ethelfleda</hi> having been founder of this place, among her other great works performed in 913.</p>
               <p>ON my return to the great road, about two miles from the place, I viſited the church of <hi>Stow-nine-Churches,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">STOW-NINE-CHURCHES.</note> to ſee the moſt elegant tomb which this or any other kingdom can boaſt of; that of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> fourth daughter of <hi>John</hi> lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> wife, firſt to Sir <hi>John Danvers,</hi> of <hi>Dantrey, Wiltſhire,</hi> and afterwards to Sir <hi>Edmund Cary,</hi> third ſon of <hi>Henry</hi> lord <hi>Hunſdon.</hi> Her figure is of white marble, lying recumbent on a ſlab of black. The attitude is the moſt eaſy poſſible, that of one aſleep; her head, covered with a looſe hood, reclines on a rich cuſhion. One hand is placed on her breaſt, the other lies on one ſide. Round her neck is a

quilled ruff. The faſhionable ſtiffneſs of her embroidered ſtays is a diſadvantage to this elegant ſculpture. Her gown flows to her feet in eaſy folds, and covers them. She lies on a long cloak, lined with ermine, faſtened at her neck with rich jewels. At her feet is a <hi>griffin</hi> holding a ſhield of the family-arms. The whole reſts on a white marble altar-tomb, with inſcriptions and arms on the ſides. After informing us of her parentage, marriages, and children, are theſe lines:

               <p>HE laid out his great income in acts of hoſpitality and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and on his death, after bequeathing £4000 to his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and friends, left the reſt of his wealth to pious uſes.

               <p>IN 1702, the laſt year allowed for undergoing the teſt, he left <hi>London</hi> on the 28th of <hi>July,</hi> and went to <hi>Oxford</hi> with a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ſacrifice all his preferments on the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the laſt day allowed by the act.

antient owners. There were five of them. The firſt was great nephew to the Conqueror; the laſt died in 1295.</p>
               <p>FROM hence I deſcended to the great road: the country hilly and clayey. The quarries are of a coarſe grit ſtone, often filled with ſhells, but of too ſhattery a nature to be uſed, except in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary buildings. A few miles farther is an eminence, called <hi>Forſter's Booth,</hi> ſo named from a booth erected here by one <hi>Forſter,</hi> a poor countryman. It grew at length into a ſcattered ſtreet, of ſeveral houſes and carriers inns, through which runs the <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtreet</hi> road in a direct line to <hi>Touceſter,</hi> four miles diſtant.</p>
               <p>THIS is a pretty conſiderable town, ſeated on a plain, <note place="margin">TOUCESTER.</note> on a ſmall ſtream called the <hi>Tove,</hi> from which the name is derived; <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> or the caſtle on the <hi>Tove.</hi> The great <hi>tumulus</hi> on the eaſt ſide of the town, points out of the ſite of the <hi>ſpeculum</hi> or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower. The <hi>Roman</hi> coins found in digging about, prove it to have been an appendage to a <hi>Roman</hi> ſtation, whoſe name has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reached us. The <hi>Saxons</hi> profited of this little fortreſs, and added the foſs which ſurrounded it.

               <p>THIS manor, after various changes, became the property of the famous Sir <hi>Richard Empſon,</hi> one of the inſtruments of the avarice and oppreſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> VII; who, in 1509, loſt his head, with <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> on <hi>Tower-hill;</hi> perhaps more deſervedly than le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally. <hi>Empſon</hi> had been the ſon of a ſieve-maker in this town: by his great abilities in the profeſſion of the law, he was promoted to the chancellorſhip of the duchy of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> but by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded ſubmiſſion to the will of his rapacious maſter, fell a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, in the next reign, to the demands of an enraged nation.

THE recovery of part of his fortune was owing to a ſingular accident. During his proſperous days he kept, as uſual in thoſe days, in the eſtabliſhment of people of rank, a fool or jeſter: his was the noted <hi>Wil. Sommers,</hi>

He returned to his houſe, which he enjoyed only two years, dying in <hi>January</hi> 1552-3.

I muſt not quit the lady, without ſaying ſhe ſuffered, with exemplary patience, a long impriſonment and great confiſcations, on account of the loyalty of her family; which were rewarded with a peerage in the perſon of her ſon Sir <hi>William Fermor.</hi>

               <p>FROM hence I continued my journey ſouthward, and much of the way near the borders of <hi>Whittlewood,</hi> or <hi>Whittlebury Foreſt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">WHITTLEBURY FOREST.</note> which ſtill continues wooded for ſeveral miles in length, and of different extents in breadth, in a moſt deep and clayey country. Much of the timber is cut in rotation, but in parts towards the edge of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> are conſiderable quantities of good oak. This foreſt remained in the crown till the year 1685, when <hi>Henry Fitz-roy,</hi> firſt duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> was appointed hereditary ranger.

THAT fierce animal the wild cat, is ſtill met with in this foreſt. In the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> I. the abbot and convent of <hi>Peterborough</hi> had a charter for hunting in this place the hare, the fox, and the wild cat; which was confirmed to them, in 1253, by <hi>Henry</hi> III <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Morton,</hi> 443.</note>. By theſe charters, the wild cat ſhould be added to the beaſts of foreſt, or of venerie; which the book of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and old Sir <hi>Triſtram,</hi> in his <hi>worthie Treatiſe of Hunting,</hi> confined to the hart, the hynde, the hare, the boare, and the wolfe: the hart and hind being ſeparated, becauſe the ſeaſon of hunting them was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; yet they remain in ſpecies ſtill the ſame. Beaſts of the chace (which was an inferior ſort of foreſt) were the buck, the doe, the fox, the martion, and the roe <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Manwood's Foreſt Laws,</hi> 39.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE fondneſs that ſeized the regular clergy for the pleaſures of the chace, did not appear till after the Conqueſt. The <hi>Saxon</hi> clergy were expreſsly forbidden the amuſement. King <hi>Edgar</hi> directs the prieſt <q>to be neither a hunter nor hawker, nor yet a tippler; but to keep cloſe to his books, as becomes a man of his order <note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>THE canon law ſtill preſerved its ſeverity, and forbad to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual perſons the amuſement of the chace. This probably was rather deſigned to check what might by the exceſs eſtrange them from their ſacred function. The common law, from a principle of good ſenſe and humanity, permitted the recreation, from theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; that nothing could contribute more effectually to the performance of their duty than good health, reſulting from fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; as nothing could diſqualify them ſo greatly as the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ariſing from a ſedentary life. This indulgence probably
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0369200900:226"/>
ſoon ended in abuſe. In the twelfth century, we find <hi>Abelard</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in preſiding over a monaſtery of huntſmen. <hi>Chaucer,</hi> as I have before quoted, flings a fine ridicule on the ſporting monk. Finally, the chace became ſo neceſſary an appendage to the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſtate, that every ſee had a number of parks: that of <hi>Norwich,</hi> thirteen; and the ſixth mortuary which the king clamed on the death of a prelate, was his kennel of hounds.</p>

AFTER paſſing through the village of the ſame name, built on each ſide of the <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> road, I entered the county of HERTFORD; and near the twenty-eighth mile-ſtone leave on the right <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FLAMSTED.</note> where ſtood a ſmall priory of <hi>Benedictine</hi> nuns, founded in the time of king <hi>Stephen,</hi> by <hi>Roger de Tonei.</hi> The manor had been granted by the Conqueror to <hi>Ralph de Tonei.</hi> His predeceſſor was a <hi>Saxon</hi> knight, called <hi>Thurnoth,</hi> who, with the true ſpirit of the times, engaged with thirteen ſoldiers, <hi>Waldef,</hi> and <hi>Thurman,</hi> to protect all paſſengers from the thieves and wild beaſts which then infeſted the road; and in time of war, to protect the church of St. <hi>Albans</hi> with all their might. <hi>Leofftan,</hi> abbot of that convent in the time of the Confeſſor, facilitated the undertaking, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the great woods on the ſide of the <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> which gave ſhelter to robbers. He beſtowed on <hi>Thurnoth</hi> this manor; who, in return, preſented <hi>Leofftan</hi> with five ounces of gold and a fair palfrey. <hi>Thurnoth,</hi> at the Conqueſt, reſiſted the power of the <hi>Norman</hi> invader; who beſtowed it on <hi>de Tonei;</hi> who directed that the ſame ſervices ſhould be ſtrictly performed to the abbey <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>ABOUT three miles further, go through <hi>Redburn,</hi> a ſmall town, <note place="margin">REDBURN.</note> built like the former, on each ſide of the antient road.

who lodging at the houſe of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> at <hi>Verulam,</hi> proved the means of his converſion.

I am ſorry to find, that, after all, the very exiſtence of this Saint is doubted; for there are ſome who believe that the Saint was no more than an <hi>amphibalus,</hi> a long cloak, which St. <hi>Alban,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to execution, threw about him; which being at length perſonified, was canonized, and received into the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar <note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>A CELL, conſiſting of a prior and a few <hi>Benedictines</hi> from St. <hi>Albans,</hi> was placed here. It was dedicated to St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> and his companions, and was inhabited before 1195. After the diſſolution, it was, with the manor, granted to <hi>John Cork</hi>

               <p>THIS manor was, from very antient times, part of the lands of the abbey of St. <hi>Albans:</hi> the original name is not delivered to us; that which it has at preſent was derived from <hi>Robert de Gorham,</hi> elected abbot of the houſe in 1151.

                     <hi>Wilſon,</hi> 159.</note>. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> makes a moſt finical appearance: his habit elegant: has on a ſaſh, a hat with a white feather, laced turnover, a long love-lock extended on his left arm, an ear-ring in one ear, a ſpear in the other, and brown boots. Thus he is repreſented as a ſmart office-clerk, walking in his new-acquired park; for he was clerk of the privy council to two kings: and got poſſeſſion of <hi>Gorhambury</hi> from his maſter, who conveyed it to him on foreſeeing his fall. Like a grateful ſervant, <hi>Meautys</hi> erected a handſome monument to him in a neighboring church, more to ſhew his reſpect, than from any neceſſity of endeavouring to preſerve the memory of one ſelf-immortalized.</p>

On the picture is this motto, <hi>Nec pudet vivere, nec piget mori.</hi> This gentleman was one of thoſe worthy perſons who ſet out with a view of reforming the abuſes of the arbitrary court of <hi>Charles</hi> I. but whoſe moderation and good ſenſe made them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their own party, when it attempted meaſures ſubverſive of the conſtitution: in conſequence, he, with ſeveral others, were excluded the houſe. In 1656, he was elected one of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s parlement; but not being approved by the ſlaviſh council of the uſurper, was laid aſide. He was active in promoting the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; was choſen ſpeaker of the parlement; was rewarded with

This generous peer ſtepped forward in the cauſe of liberty, in the beginning of the troubles of <hi>Charles</hi> I. while he held the poſt of lord high admiral: a poſt he was diſplaced from by the popular party, by reaſon of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; which they ſuſpected would be a check to their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable views. He was conſtantly a mediating commiſſioner in all treaties on the ſide of the parlement; in which he behaved with dignity, ſpirit, and integrity. He was appointed governor of the king's children while they were ſeparated from him, and behaved to them with reſpect and affection. He joined with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ordonnance for the trial of his maſter; and, after his death, retired to <hi>Petworth,</hi> and took no part with the uſurping powers. He joined heartily in the Reſtoration; but, like a true friend to his country, wiſhed for it on terms of ſecurity to the people, and advantage for the nation. He received from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored king honors ſuited to his rank, and enjoyed them till his death, in 1668.</p>

He quitted <hi>England,</hi> for which, as lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> ſays, he had little other affection than as he had a great ſhare in it, in which, like a great leviathan, he might ſport himſelf. He was a man of a noble preſence, and affected a plain garb. He accordingly is here dreſſed in a dark habit, robed with fur. His countenance correſponds to the deſcription: his hair ſhort, and his beard buſhy: his turnover plain; and the only ornament is the pendent order of the Garter.</p>

I SHALL conclude with a very ſingular portrait on wood, <note place="margin">PHILIP LE BON DUKE OF BURGUNDY.</note> called <hi>Sylveſter de Grimſton,</hi> a noble <hi>Norman,</hi> ſtandard-bearer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror at the battle of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and afterwards his chamberlain. He held lands in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> of the lord <hi>Roos;</hi> among others, that of <hi>Grimſton</hi> in <hi>Holderneſs;</hi> from whence he took the name. The picture is antient and curious, but wants four centuries of the great period in which <hi>Sylveſter</hi> lived; neither did that age afford any artiſts that could give even a tolerable repreſentation of the human figure, much leſs convey down a likeneſs of the fierce heroes of their times. I premiſe this, to ſhew the impoſſibility of this portrait having been a copy of ſome original of this great anceſtor. The dreſs is ſingular: a large bonnet, with a very long ſilken appendage; a green jacket, hanging ſleeves: a collar of SS held in one hand: his face beardleſs. On the back of the picture is <hi>Petrus</hi> xoi. <hi>me fecit, anno</hi> 1416. The artiſt is unknown to me: but the habit of the perſon is that of the date; for I find in <hi>Monfaucon's Monarchie Francoiſe</hi> ſeveral perſons of rank in the dreſs, particularly <hi>Philip Le Bon</hi> duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> between whom and this portrait, there is ſo ſtrong a reſemblance of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note n="*" place="bottom">See the book cited, vol. iii. p. 260. tab. xlix. fig. 2.</note>, that I do not heſitate to imagine that the <hi>Gorhambury</hi> portrait is no other than one of this illuſtrious prince.

               <p>THE abbots lived in ſplendor, ſuitable to their rank and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. They dined in the great hall, at a table to which there was a flight of fifteen ſteps. The monks ſerved up the dinner in plate, and in their way made a halt at every fifth ſtep, where there was a landing, and ſung on each a ſhort hymn. The abbot uſually ſat alone in the middle of the table; and when any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of rank came, he ſat towards the end of the table. After the monks had waited ſome time on the abbot, they ſat down at two other tables, placed on the ſides of the hall, and had their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices brought in by the novices; who, when the monks had dined, ſat down to their own dinners<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>THE church, <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note> in its preſent ſtate, is a moſt venerable and great pile: its form that of a croſs, with a tower. At the interſection the length is ſix hundred feet; that of the tranſepts one hundred and eighty. The height of the tower one hundred and forty-four feet; that of the body ſixty-five; of the ailes thirty; the breadth of the body two hundred and ſeventeen.</p>
               <p>BY neglect, <note place="margin">RUINED.</note> or by the ravages of war, the original church fell to decay. Abbot <hi>Ealdred,</hi> who lived in 969, deſigned to pull down and rebuild it; and for that purpoſe collected, from the ruins of <hi>Verulamium,</hi> all the ſtone, tiles, and timber, he could find. Death put a ſtop to his intention. His ſucceſſor, <hi>Eadmer,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the taſk of getting together the materials; and in his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0369200900:289"/>
ſearch, found great quantities of curious antiquities; ſuch as altars, urns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the pious man broke to pieces, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then abominations. He alſo, as is ſaid, diſcovered ſeveral books, ſome in <hi>Britiſh,</hi> others in <hi>Latin;</hi> and a great one in a language and character unknown to any but an old prieſt. This was found to be the authentic life of St. <hi>Alban;</hi> which was carefully trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up, being a confirmation of what <hi>Bede</hi> had wrote on the ſame ſubject. The other books, being only accounts of heathen mythology, inventions of the devil, were inſtantly condemned to the flames<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Stevens,</hi> i. 237.</note>.</p>
               <p>A FAMINE ſtopped the deſign of the new church, under the abbot <hi>Leofric.</hi> The troubles that enſued, under the remaining <hi>Saxon</hi> monarchs, and the unſettled ſtate of the kingdom at the Conqueſt, occaſioned the plan to lie dormant till the year 1077, when it was executed by abbot <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> monk. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that purpoſe the timber,<note place="margin">AND REBUILT.</note> the ſtones, and tiles, collected by his predeceſſors<note n="†" place="bottom">Ex lapidibus et tegulis veleris civitatis <hi>Verolamii</hi> et materie lignea quam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit a praedeceſſoribus ſuis collectam et reſervatam. <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> 1001.</note>: accordingly we ſee the far greater and more antient part of the walls a motley compoſition of ſtones and <hi>Roman</hi> tiles.</p>
               <p>MANY other parts afterwards were pulled down, <note place="margin">ALTERATIONS.</note> and rebuilt in the ſtile of the times; and I ſuſpect that, in general, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent windows are long poſterior to thoſe coeval with the walls; being painted, and of a taſte of another age. The windows in the great tower, and perhaps the range along the nave, are of time intervening; for they differ from the mode of each of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0369200900:290"/>
others. I find this confirmed in the lives of the abbots. <hi>John</hi> (firſt of the name) who died in 1214, pulled down the front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, which was built of old tiles, ſo ſtrongly cemented with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that it proved a work of great labor. Maſter <hi>Hugh Goldcliff,</hi> a moſt excellent workman, was employed; who, conſulting more the ornaments of ſculpture, of images and flowers, neglected the ſecurity of his building; ſo that it fell down, and was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed during the life of this good abbot<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> 1047.</note>. His ſucceſſor, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Trampington,</hi> had the honor of completing his deſign. He not only rebuilt that front, but made new windows, and put glaſs into them, ſo as to give more light to the church. He alſo raiſed the ſteeple much higher, covered it with lead, and died full of good works, in 1235 <note n="†" place="bottom">The ſame, 1054, 1063.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN the abbacy of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Whethamſtead,</hi> this church received the moſt conſiderable alterations. To avoid prolixity, I omit the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous works of that moſt munificent abbot: I ſhall only note the change he made in the exterior part, by enlarging and glazing the windows on the north ſide of the church, which was before dark, and by cauſing a large window to be made at the weſt end of the north a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>THIS beautiful tomb was once inſulated, as appears by one of theſe <hi>items.</hi> In the middle is a pervious arch, adorned above with the coat of arms of the deceaſed; and others again along a freeze; with his ſupporters, two antelopes with collars. From the freeze ariſes a light elegant tabernacle-work, with niches; containing on one ſide the effigies of our princes; the other ſide is deſpoiled of the figures.</p>
               <p>IN 1703, the vault in which repoſed the remains of this illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious perſonage was diſcovered. The body was preſerved in a

leaden coffin, in a ſtrong pickle; and over that was another caſe, of wood, now periſhed. Againſt the wall is painted a Crucifixion, with four chalices receiving the blood; a hand pointing towards it, with a label, inſcribed <hi>Lord have mercy upon me.</hi>

His arms, alluſive to his name, are three ears of wheat; and the motto, alluſive to the flouriſhing ſtate of the monaſtery under his government, is <hi>Valles abundabunt,</hi> twice repeated. <hi>Weever,</hi> from p. 562 to 567, enumerates all his munificent works. He had a great turn towards ornamental generoſity; and cauſed this church, the Lady's chapel, and ſeveral parts of the houſe, to be adorned with hiſtorical paintings, and inſcriptions of his own compoſition to be placed under them. He alſo was a great

               <p>His artiſt was <hi>Alan Strayler,</hi> painter; <note place="margin">STRAYLER, THE PAINTER.</note> who is ſaid to have been ſo well paid for his work, that he forgave the convent three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and four pence of an old debt, for colors; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was probably complimented with the following epitaph:

               <p>I BELIEVE, ſome of his labors are yet extant in the roof of the choir; on which is painted, in compartments, an Eagle and a Lamb. Under others, in our Lady's chapel, was this line:

               <p>IN the middle of the cieling of the north aile, is a painting of the martyrdom of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> (as is ſaid) over the very ſpot on which he ſuffered.

               <p>IN the center of another cieling, is a rude painting of king <hi>Offa;</hi> and this inſcription beneath:

               <p>THE door adjacent is extremely beautiful; rich in ſculpture. The cloiſters lay on the other ſide. Nothing but the marks of their junction with the outſide of the church now remains; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of tripartite arches: nor is there the leſt relique of the vaſt and magnificent buildings, which once covered a large ſpace on this ſide.</p>
               <p>ADJOINING to the eaſt end of the church is the chapel of St. <hi>Mary,</hi>

               <p>THE town of <hi>St. Alban's</hi> is large, and, in general, <note place="margin">TOWN.</note> filled with antient buildings. It originally ſprung from a few houſes built by king <hi>Offa,</hi> for the conveniency of the officers and ſervants of the monaſtery. About the year 950, it was ſo increaſed, that king <hi>Ethelred,</hi> at the interceſſion of abbot <hi>Ulfin,</hi> gave it a grant of a market, and the rank of a borough. In the <hi>Doomſday Book,</hi> it appears at the Conqueſt to have been rated for ten hides. The <q>arable was ſixteen ploughlands. In demeſne, three hides, two ploughlands, and another may be made. There were four aliens, ſixteen villeyns, and thirteen boors, having thirteen ploughlands: forty-ſix burgeſſes: the toll, and other rents of the town, eleven pounds fourteen ſhillings a year: three mills, forty ſhillings a year: meadow, two ploughlands in quantity: wood to feed a thouſand hogs in pannage-time: and ſeven ſhillings rent. The total twenty pounds at that time; in that of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, twenty-four. There are now twelve cottagers, a park of deer, and a fiſh-pond.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE town was always conſidered as part of the demeſne of the abbey; and at the Conqueſt it was part of its poſſeſſions.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0369200900:307"/>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> I. by charter, confirmed it to them, with a market, and all the liberty attending a borough: the abbot holding, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, of the king <hi>in capite,</hi> and holding the burgeſſes as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſned men of the abbey. This tenure the burgeſſes wiſhed to force from him; which they attempted by the following ſtratagem: —In the thirty-fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> I. they had ſent repreſentatives to parlement, and alſo in the firſt and ſecond of <hi>Edward</hi> II; but in the fifth of the ſame reign, the ſheriff of <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the abbot, to ſave the expence, had omitted the uſual ſummons. This the burgeſſes complained of, aſſerting that they held of the king; hoping thereby to get releaſed of the ſervices they owed their lord abbot: or, if they ſucceeded in ſending members, to be freed of thoſe which they owed the king. Both of which expectations, in the opinion of Mr. <hi>Madox,</hi> were ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded<note n="*" place="bottom">

At the time of the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the town, with the other poſſeſſions of the abbey, fell to the king <hi>(Henry</hi> VIII.) and from him to his heir, <hi>Edward</hi> VI; who, by letters patent, dated <hi>May</hi> 12th, 1553, <note place="margin">INCORPARATED</note> made the town of <hi>St. Alban's</hi> a body corporate, by the name of the mayor and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, and granted to the ſaid mayor and burgeſſes, and their ſucceſſors, the ſaid profits, and other franchiſes; they to hold the premiſes in free burgage, and to render yearly to the crown XL. as a fee-farm, at the feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi>

               <p>THE remarkable events, which befel this town in earlier times, were, as uſual, of the ſanguinary kind. During the rage of the barons wars, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. the burgeſſes fortified the place, and defended it with ſtrong gates, well ſecured. They were particularly jealous of horſemen; therefore refuſed paſſage to all cavaliers. The conſtable of <hi>Hertford,</hi> diſpleaſed at this prohibition, in a bravado, boaſted that he would enter the town with three youths (knights) and four of his beſt villeins. He did ſo; and, walking up and down with great inſolence, aſked his companions which way the wind was. The townſmen, alarmed at the queſtion, thought he deſigned to fire their houſes. In a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary way they executed juſtice, by knocking down and beheading him, his youths, and villeins; placing their heads on poles, at the corners of their ſtreets. The king reſented this invaſion of his prerogative, and fined the town in a hundred marks; which was immediately paid<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>IN the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II. they underwent a mortification of a far heavier nature. In 1381, after the bloody inſurrection of <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> a court of juſtice was held here, by the famous Sir <hi>Robert Treſilian.

                  <note place="margin">FIRST BATTLE AT ST. ALBAN'S.</note> this town was the ſcene of dreadful carnage. Here was ſhed the firſt blood in that fatal quarrel. As ſoon as ever the weak <hi>Henry,</hi> or rather his queen and miniſters, found themſelves free from the power of his rival the duke of <hi>York,</hi> they armed their forces, and marched from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s to meet their enemy, who was advancing towards them with a mighty hoſt. They met on the 22d of <hi>May,</hi> 1455. The peaceful prince ſent out a herald to <hi>York,</hi> ſtrictly commanding him to keep the peace as became a dutiful ſubject, and to avoid effuſion of blood. <hi>York</hi>'s anſwer was humble, yet reſolute; demanding the duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and other delinquents, to be delivered into his hands, that juſtice might be executed on them, for the miſeries they had brought on the realm. <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who had been regent of <hi>France,</hi> was charged in particular with the loſs of <hi>Normandy.</hi> The king determined to ſtand the event of the day, rather than give up his friends.

Victory declared in his favor. Numbers of the nobility and gentry, with about eight hundred common men, fell on the ſide of <hi>Henry:</hi> the valiant <hi>Clifford,</hi> uſually called <hi>The Old,</hi> though only forty years of age; the earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ſon to the noted <hi>Hotſpur;</hi> and the great duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> were ſlain.

               <p>Numbers of the nobility were wounded, and numbers fled till the fury of the battle was over.

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry,</hi> wounded in the neck by an arrow, which hurtled in ſhowers on him, retreated to a poor cottage, where he was found by the conquerors. They aſked forgiveneſs on their knees; which the humane prince readily gave, on condition they would ſtop

the carnage. He became their priſoner, and they of courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came governors of the kingdom. The abbey eſcaped plunder; for fortunately the king did not make it his head-quarters.</p>
               <p>THE king, from this time to the year 1461, remained a mere ſhadow of royalty, entirely under the directions of the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> His queen was driven from him, under the terror of a proſcription. That ſpirited woman did not employ her time in prayers, or counting her beads, like her weak huſband; but, by the aſſiſtance of her northern friends, raiſed a potent army, fought and ſlew the duke of <hi>York</hi> at the battle of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> on <hi>December</hi> 30th, 1460; and, marching towards <hi>London,</hi> gave occaſion to a ſecond battle at <hi>St. Alban's.</hi>

The battle began at four in the morning, which opened in a thick miſt, with that deadly hate which the long ſeries of civil wars had created. The battle raged with various ſucceſs, as might be expected from the undaunted courage and animoſity of the leaders, and from the reflection on the certain deſtruction conſequential of defeat.

               </p>
               <p>ABOUT two miles from <hi>Northampton,</hi> I paſſed through the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Upton,</hi>

               <p>AFTER a ſhort ſpace, I croſſed the northern water, or <hi>Naeſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> a river that riſes due north, and by its junction a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with another ſtream, which flows from <hi>Fawſley-pools,</hi> forms that which receives at <hi>Northampton</hi> the name of <hi>Nen.

I ENTERED this beautiful town at the weſt gate,<note place="margin">NORTHAMPTON.</note> and paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſite of the caſtle. Nothing, excepting an outer wall and foſs, remains; in part of which is a vaſt ſtratum of ferru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous <hi>geodes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OPPOSITE to the caſtle is a great mount,<note place="margin">CASTLE.</note> once the foundation of ſome more antient fortreſs; perhaps one of the line of forts which croſſed this and the neighboring counties. One exiſts at <hi>Touceſter,</hi> and another I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of, lying about three miles to the eaſt. I cannot ſpeak with certainty of the period in which it was occupied by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who gave it the name of <hi>Hamtune.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> ſuppoſes it to have riſen from the ruins of <hi>Eltavon,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> ſtation on the ſide of the town. It appears that the <hi>Danes</hi> were poſſeſſed of <hi>Northampton</hi> in 917; and from thence long made their barbarous excurſions<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sax. Chr.</hi> 104, 106.</note>. Before the year 1010, they had quitted the place; but in their inroads in that year, they burnt the town, and deſolated the country.</p>
               <p>IN 1064, it found in the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> under <hi>Morcar,</hi> who had advanced as far as <hi>Northampton,</hi> a cruel ſet of banditti, who committed moſt unprovoked outrages. They murdered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, burnt the houſes, and carried off thouſands of cattle, and multitudes of priſoners. But in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, here were LX burgeſſes in the king's lordſhip, and LX houſes. At the time of the Conqueſt, fourteen were waſte; but at the time of the ſurvey, there were forty burgeſſes in the new borough<note n="†" place="bottom">Doomſday-book, <hi>in</hi> Mortor's Northampt.</note>.</p>

                  <hi>Simon de Sancto Licio,</hi> or <hi>Senliz,</hi> a noble <hi>Norman,</hi> founded here the caſtle. He had married <hi>Maude,</hi> daughter of <hi>Waltheof,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and ſucceeded to the title.</p>
               <p>THE Conqueror had beſtowed this town, and whole hundred of <hi>Fawſley,</hi> then worth forty pounds a year, on <hi>St. Liz,</hi> to provide ſhoes for his horſes<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I MUST particularize the great council held there in 1164, in which the contumacy of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was puniſhed by a heavy fine. At this time, <hi>the whole people came, as one man;</hi> and yet all were unequal to the pride and obſtinacy of the ſingle prelate<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Lord Lyttelton's Henry</hi> II. 41 to 56.</note>. The other great council, or parlement, was ſummoned in 1176, to confirm the ſtatutes of <hi>Clarendon;</hi> in which the rights of the crown and cuſtoms of the realm, eſpecially as to judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, had been eſtabliſhed<note n="‡" place="bottom">The ſame, V. 264, octavo, 2d edit.</note>.</p>
               <p>DURING the civil conteſts which <hi>England</hi> was ſo unhappily afflicted with, it came in for its ſhare of the calamities incident to war.

This was done in the fullneſs of their power; but as ſoon as the perjured prince got the upper hand, he appointed <hi>Fulk de Breans</hi> (a valiant but baſe-born <hi>Norman</hi>) to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as one in whom he could entirely confide<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>IN the year 1263, the younger <hi>Mounfort</hi> and his barons held it againſt their ſovereign <hi>Henry</hi> III.

               <p>IN 1460, <hi>Henry</hi> VI. made <hi>Northampton</hi> the place of rendezvous of his forces. The ſtrength of his army encouraged his ſpirited queen to offer battle to his young antagoniſt, the earl of <hi>Marche,</hi> then at the head of a potent army. A conference was demanded by the earl, and rejected by the royal party; who marched out of the town, and encamped in the meadows between it and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinſton.</hi> The battle was fierce and bloody; but by the treachery of <hi>Edmund</hi> lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthen;</hi> who deſerted his unhappy maſter, victory declared in favor of the houſe of <hi>York.</hi> Thouſands were ſlain, or drowned in the <hi>Nen:</hi> among them the duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum,</hi> earl of <hi>Shrewſbury, John</hi> viſcount <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and lord <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> The duke was interred in the church of the <hi>Grey Friars;</hi> others of the men of rank, in the adjacent abbey of <hi>De la Prè;</hi> and others, in the hoſpital of St. <hi>John,</hi> in the town.</p>

               <p>IN the civil wars of the laſt century, <hi>Northampton</hi> was ſeized by lord <hi>Brook,</hi> for the uſe of the parlement.

               <p>ST. <hi>Peter</hi>'s church is a ſingular building.<note place="margin">ST.

The middle of the tower is ornamented with ſmall round arches, which are continued along the outſide of the body of the church, and have a good effect.

               <p>IN old times <hi>Northampton</hi> was poſſeſſed of three other

That of 1779 amounted to near eight hundred pounds; and the number of patients perfectly cured, from its foundation in 1744 to the former year, is not fewer than thirteen thouſand one hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>THE county hall is a very handſome building,<note place="margin">COUNTY HALL.</note> and ornamented in the manner which gives dignity to courts of juſtice. The vulgar are affected with external ſhew, and never pay half the reſpect to a judge ſcampering in boots and bob-wig up the ſtairs of a barn-like court, as they would to the ſame perſon, who adds ſolemnity to his merit, and aſſumes the garb ſuited to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>

               <p>THE town or guild hall, is an antient building, in which the corporation tranſacts its buſineſs. <hi>Northampton</hi> was incorporated by <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> III. gave it power of chuſing annually a mayor, and two bailiffs, to be elected by all the freemen; but <hi>Henry</hi> VII. ordered by charter,<note place="margin">CHARTER</note> that the mayor and his brethren,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0369200900:341"/>
late mayors, ſhould name forty-eight perſons of the inhabitants, with liberty of changing them as often as was found neceſſary; which forty-eight, with the mayor and his brethren, and ſuch as had been mayors and bailiffs, were annually to elect all future mayors and bailiffs. There are, beſides, a recorder, chamberlain, and town-clerk. The mayor, late mayor, and one other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the corporation, nominated by the mayor, aldermen, and bailiffs, are juſtices of the peace within the town for one year. The mayor, recorder or his deputy, and one juſtice, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to form a ſeſſions: they have power in criminal cauſes to try all offenders; but wiſely leave all but petty larcenies to the judges of the great ſeſſions<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Northampton</hi> is among the moſt antient boroughs.

Some is more antient than his time; yet he probably had the reſtoring of the old houſe, as the finiſhing appears, by a date on the ſtone balluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade, to be 1624, preceded by the pious text, <hi>Niſi</hi> DOMINUS <hi>aedificaverit Domum, in vanum laboraverunt qui aedificant cum.</hi>

                     <hi>Morton,</hi> 538.</note> attributes this to the <hi>Danes,</hi> and imagines it to have been a ſummer-camp of one of the plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties which infeſted the kingdom of <hi>Mercia</hi> about the year 921.

became maſter of this manor. He is dreſſed in armour, with a collar of SS, and a roſe at the end. His head reſts on a helmet, whoſe creſt is a hand holding a ſtag's horn. His upper lip is bare, but his beard is enormous, regularly curled in two rows. He was called to the Houſe of Peers on this ſecond marriage of his niece, was appointed her chamberlain, and, during the queen's regency, on the king's expedition to <hi>France</hi> in 1544, had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhewn him to be named as a council to her majeſty, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally to be called in<note n="*" place="bottom">

FROM the <hi>Queen's Croſs</hi> to this place the country is uneven, unwatered, and far from pleaſant. It is now, in general, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed; but the hedges are young, and, till within theſe few years, quite a novelty.</p>

She had not been married three years, before her huſband was ſnatched from her by an ignominious and merited death, for his deep concern in the plot, which, thanks to the charity of the times, is execrated by each religion. It is very probable, that a mind ſo tinctured with bigotry as his was, ſoon devoted itſelf to the moſt deſperate reſolutions, for the reſtoration of the antient church. He foreſaw the certain conſequences of ill ſucceſs, and, preparing againſt the event, took every method to preſerve his infant ſon from ſuffering from the fault of the father. Before he committed any acts of treaſon, he ſecured to his heirs his eſtates, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to put it out of the power of the crown to profit by their confiſcation<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>MOST of the particulars relative to this great family,<note place="margin">DIGBY PEDIGREE.</note> I owe to the friendſhip of my worthy neighbor <hi>Watkin Williams,</hi> Eſquire, who favored me with the uſe of the famous genealogy of the <hi>Digbys</hi> of <hi>Tilton;</hi> a book compiled by the direction of Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi> in 1634, at the expence of twelve hundred pounds. This tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is very credible, to any who have ſeen the book: a large folio, conſiſting of five hundred and eighty-nine vellum leaves; the firſt hundred and ſixty-five ornamented with the coats of arms of the family and its allies, and of all the tombs of the <hi>Digbys</hi> then extant, illuminated in the richeſt and moſt exquiſite manner. The reſt of the book is compoſed of grants, wills, and variety of other pieces, ſerving to illuſtrate the hiſtory of the family; drawn from the moſt authentic records, as the title ſets forth. Several of the wills are curious proofs of the ſimplicity of the manners of the times; and another, of the magnificence, ſuperſtition, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our greater anceſtors.

               <p>I NOW return to the period when the family emerged from its misfortune; and in the perſon of Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> the ſon of the laſt Sir <hi>Evarard,</hi> was reſtored to its former honor, by the uncommon merits of the ſucceſſor. He married <hi>Venetia,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>Edward Stanley</hi> of <hi>Tongue Caſtle, Shropſhire,</hi> Knight of the Bath. His eldeſt ſon, <hi>Kenelm,</hi> was ſlain in 1648, in the civil wars, at <hi>St. Neots:</hi> his ſecond ſon, <hi>John,</hi> ſucceeded to the eſtate, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0369200900:369"/>
his father many years. He left by his wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter of Sir <hi>Edward Longueville</hi> of <hi>Wolverton,</hi> in this county, Baronet, two daughters; the eldeſt, <hi>Margaret Maria,</hi> married Sir <hi>John Conway</hi> of <hi>Boddruddan,</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire;</hi> the younger, <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotta,</hi> married <hi>Richard Moſtyn</hi> of <hi>Penbedw,</hi> in the ſame county, Eſquire. Theſe two gentlemen, in 1704, ſold this manor, with <hi>Stoke Goldington,</hi> and the advowſon of both the churches, to <hi>George Wright,</hi> Eſquire, ſon of the lord keeper, Sir <hi>Nathan Wright;</hi> in whoſe poſterity it ſtill remains. By the preceding owners, the reliques of Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi>'s collection came into my country; but the leaving behind the two beautiful buſts of lady <hi>Venetia,</hi> impreſs no favorable idea of their taſte.</p>
               <p>SOME portraits,<note place="margin">PORTRAITS.</note> belonging to the former poſſeſſors, ſtill keep a place in the houſe. In the parlour is a full-length of old Mr. <hi>Digby,</hi>

belt, a bonnet with a white feather in it, flowered belt, with one hand on his ſword. Above him, in a tablet, is repreſented a lady, in a moſt ſupplicatory attitude, with a lute in one hand, and a purſe in the other, offering it to him. He ſtands by her, with averted look, one hand on his breaſt, and with an air which ſhews his rejection of her addreſſes, and horror at the infamy of merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary love; and as if uttering to her the words inſcribed near to him, <hi>his majora</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This portrait is inſcribed on the back <hi>John Digby;</hi> but from the romantic circumſtance attending it, the dreſs, and the likeneſs to other pictures of Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> I cannot help ſuppoſing it to be his.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS is a portrait of the famous Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> in his youthful days; that prodigy of learning, credulity, valour, and romance, whoſe merits, although mixed with many foibles, entirely oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated every attention to the memory of his father's infamy. The circumſtance of the lady painted along with him, is a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth of the ſtory related by <hi>Lloyd,</hi> that an <hi>Italian</hi> prince, who was childleſs, earneſtly wiſhed that his princeſs might become a mother by Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> whom he eſteemed as a juſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of perfection. It is probable that the princeſs would not have diſobeyed the commands of her lord: but whether the painting alludes to our knight's cruelty on this occaſion, or whether it might not deſcribe the adventure of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> lady, recorded in an elegant old ballad<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Antient Songs and Ballads,</hi> ii. 231.</note>, I will not pretend to determine.</p>
               <p>IN the long room above ſtairs,<note place="margin">LADY VENETIA.</note> is the picture of his beloved wife <hi>Venetia Anaſtatia Stanley,</hi> in a <hi>Roman</hi> habit, with curled locks. In one hand is a ſerpent; the other is on a pair of white doves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0369200900:371"/>
She is painted at <hi>Windſor</hi> in the ſame emblematic manner, but in a different dreſs, and with accompaniments explanatory of the emblems. The doves ſhew her innocency; the ſerpent, which ſhe handles with impunity, ſhews her triumph over the enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed tongues of the times. We know not the particulars of the ſtory. Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> muſt allude to her exculpation of the charge, whatſoever it was, when he mentions her as <q>a lady of an extraordinary beauty, of as extraordinary ſame<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Lord Clarendon's Life,</hi> 34.</note>.</q> In the ſame picture is a genius about to place a wreath on her head. Beneath her is a Cupid, proſtrate: and behind him is Calumny, with two faces, flung down and bound; a beautiful compliment on her victory over Malevolence. Her hair in this picture is light, and differs in color from that in the other. I have heard, from a deſcendant of her's, that ſhe affected different hair-dreſſes, and different-colored eye-brows, to ſee which beſt became her.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Kenelm</hi> was ſo enamoured with her beauty, that he was ſaid to have attempted to exalt her charms, and preſerve her health, by a variety of whimſical experiments. Among others, that of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with capons fed with the fleſh of vipers<note n="†" place="bottom">I am told, that the great ſnail, or <hi>Pomatia, (Br. Zool.</hi> iv. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 128) is found in the neighboring woods, which is its moſt ſouthern reſidence in this iſland. It is of exotic origin. Tradition ſays, it was introduced by Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> as a medicine for the uſe of his lady.</note>; and that, to improve her complexion, he was perpetually inventing new coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metics. Probably ſhe fell a victim to theſe arts; for ſhe was found dead in bed, <hi>May</hi> 1ſt, 1633, in the thirty-third year of her age. She was buried in <hi>Chriſtchurch, London,</hi> under a large inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

               </p>
               <p>BOTH the pictures are the performances of <hi>Vandyck.</hi> In this at <hi>Gothurſt</hi> are two of her ſons, of a boyiſh age, and in the dreſs of the times.</p>
               <p>HERE are, beſides, two moſt beautiful buſts of the ſame lady,<note place="margin">BUSTS OF LADY VENETIA.</note> in braſs; whether by <hi>Le Soeur</hi> or <hi>Fanelli,</hi> I am not certain. One is in the dreſs of the times: an elegant laced handkerchief falls over her ſhoulders, leaving her neck bare. Her hair is curled, braided, twiſted, and formed on the hind part of her head into a circle; beneath which fall elegant locks. On this buſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<q>
                     <hi>Uxorem vivam amare voluptas, defunctam, religio.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE other is <hi>a l'antique.</hi> The head is dreſſed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, only bound in a fillet: the drapery covers her breaſt; but ſo artificially, as not to deſtroy the elegancy of the form.</p>
               <p>I KNOW of no perſons who are painted in greater variety of forms and places, than this illuſtrious pair: poſſibly becauſe they were the fineſt ſubjects of the times. Mr. <hi>Walpole</hi> is in poſſeſſion of ſeveral moſt exquiſite miniatures of the lady, by <hi>Oliver,</hi> bought from the heirs of <hi>Boddrudan</hi> and <hi>Pembedw,</hi> at a very high price. The moſt valuable is one in a gold caſe, where ſhe is painted in company with her huſband. There is another, ſaid to be painted after ſhe was dead; and four others, in water-colors.</p>
               <p>THE ſame gentleman is in poſſeſſion of a beautiful miniature
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0369200900:374"/>
of her mother, lady <hi>Lucy Percy,</hi> purchaſed at the ſame time. She is dreſſed like a citizen's wife, and with dark hair.</p>
               <p>AMONG other portraits,<note place="margin">LORD KEEPER WRIGHT.</note> is a full-length of the lord keeper, Sir <hi>Nathan Wright,</hi> in his robes, and a head of Sir <hi>Joſeph Jekyll,</hi> with a long wig and robes. The firſt received his appointment in the year 1700, unfortunately for him, as ſucceſſor to lord <hi>Somers;</hi> whoſe precipitate diſmiſſion, in favor of a Tory, hardly allowed time for reflection on the impropriety of the choice. Sir <hi>Nathan</hi> kept his place till the year 1703, when he was diſmiſſed, not without diſgrace; more through defect of ability than want of integrity: but contemned by both parties.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a very different character: a ſtaunch Whig, and a man of great abilities and worth. He died Maſter of the Rolls, in 1738. His wig was probably none of the beſt, if we are to truſt theſe complimentary lines of <hi>Pope</hi>

Sir <hi>Roger</hi> was one of the knights who attended <hi>Edward</hi> I. into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and <hi>Roger,</hi> his ſon, was ſheriff of this county as early as the fifteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> II<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1322, or the fifteenth of <hi>Edward</hi> II. <hi>Roger de Tyringham</hi> was appointed to ſuperintend the eſtates forfeited in this county, on the earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>'s rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. <hi>Rymer,</hi> iii. 963.</note>.

I have a fine print of him, given me by the late Mr. <hi>Backwell,</hi> one of his deſcendants. He was, ſays Mr. <hi>Granger,</hi> an alderman of <hi>London</hi> and a banker, of great ability, induſtry, and integrity, and of moſt extenſive credit; but ruined in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. by the infamous project of ſhutting up the Exchequer. He retired to <hi>Holland,</hi> where he died, and was brought over to be interred in the church of <hi>Tyringham;</hi> where he lies embalmed. A glaſs is placed over his face; ſo his viſage may poſſibly be ſeen to this time.</p>
               <p>I COULD not but admire a ſpirited picture of a Falcon ſtooping at Bitterns.</p>
               <p>IN the hall is a curious table, of an aſh-colored marble. I ſhould call it a polyneſious marble, being veined like a chart filled with little iſlands, nicely ſhaded at their edges.</p>

               <p>THE laſt abbot, <hi>Robert Hobbs,</hi> was hanged at <hi>Woburn,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1537, for not acknowleging the king's ſupremacy. The monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and its revenues, in 1547, were granted by <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> ſoon after created earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> by the ſame prince. No one profited ſo greatly by the plunder of the church as this family: the fortune, even to the preſent time, doth principally originate from gifts of this nature. To the grant of <hi>Woburn</hi> it owes much of its property in this county, and in <hi>Bucks;</hi> to that of the rich abbey of <hi>Taviſtoke,</hi> vaſt fortunes and intereſt in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> and, to render them more extenſive, that of <hi>Dunkeſwell</hi> was added. The donation of <hi>Thorney</hi> abbey gave him an amazing tract of fens in <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> together with a great revenue. <hi>Melchburn</hi> abbey (I ſhould have before ſaid) increaſed his property in <hi>Bedfordſhire;</hi> the priory of <hi>Caſtle Hymel</hi> gave him footing in

                  <q>LORD, let me underſtand the reaſon of theſe dark and wounding providences, that I ſink not under the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own thoughts. I know I have deſerved my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and will be ſilent under it; but yet ſecretly my heart mourns, becauſe I have not the dear companion and ſharer of my joys and ſorrows: I want him to talk with, to eat, and ſleep with. All theſe things are irkſome to me now: the day unwelcome, and the night ſo too. All company and meals I would avoid, if it might be; yet all this is, that I enjoy not the world in my own way; and this ſure hinders my comfort. When I ſee my children before me, I remember the pleaſure he took in them! This makes my heart to ſhrink. Can I regret his quitting a leſſer good for a bigger? O! if I did ſtedfaſtly believe, I could not be dejected! But I will not injure myſelf, to ſay I offer my mind any inferior conſolation to ſupply this loſs: no, I moſt willingly forſake this world, this vexatious, troubleſome world, in which I have no other buſineſs but to rid my ſoul from ſin; ſecure, by faith and a good conſcience, my eternal intereſt; with patience and courage bear my eminent misfortunes, and ever hereafter be above the ſmiles and frowns of it; and when I have done the remnant of the work ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me on earth, then joyfully wait for the heavenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in GOD'S good time; when, by his infinite mercy, I

Her black conic cap is faced with gold and jewels. A rich chain of great pearls and ſmall vaſes, red and gold, are other ornaments to our bigotted ſovereign. The date is 1553. Sir <hi>Antonio</hi> was ſent from <hi>Spain</hi> to draw her picture; ſo has placed them in a ſcene of aukward courtſhip; for they were not married till the following year.</p>

The ſtory is not well known; but it certainly alludes to a family tranſaction ſimilar to that in <hi>Otway</hi>'s <hi>Orphan,</hi> and gave riſe to it.

expired; for her bawd and creature, Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> went to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in a yellow ruff, and put the wearers out of conceit with it. I need not enlarge on the well-known marriage and divorce of this lady from the earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> They are too well known to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on; as is her weakneſs, in having recourſe to the impoſtor <hi>Forman</hi> for philtres to debilitate <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and impel the affections of <hi>Somerſet</hi> towards her.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0369200900:410"/>
others, was by far the moſt illuſtrious character of the age in which ſhe lived. Her virtues, domeſtic and public, were of the moſt exalted kind. Hoſpitality, charity, and piety, were in her pre-eminent. I ſpeak not of her great maternal cares; nature dictates that, more or leſs, in all the ſex: but her abilities in the management of the vaſt affairs of her family, perplexed with numberleſs litigations, gave her a diſtinguiſhed character. She at left equalled her lord in loyalty, and was indefatigable in inciting the nobility, who had quitted the cauſe of majeſty, to expiate their error. After the battle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſhe lived three years in privacy at her brother's houſe at <hi>Ampthill,</hi> and had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with ſeveral great perſonages, on the ſubject of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the exiled king. The reſerved <hi>Monk</hi> had ſuch an opinion of her prudence, as to communicate to her the ſignal by which ſhe might know his intentions on that ſubject.

What is ſingular in this monument is, the preſervation of the very ball with which he was killed, a five or ſix pounder; which is placed within the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, inlaid in the marble; and on the molding of the pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on each ſide of the bullet, are the words,

                  <hi>Ampthill Park,</hi> and that of <hi>Houghton,</hi> contiguous to it, were granted by <hi>James</hi> I. to Sir <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> of <hi>Kinloſs</hi> (a favorite, brought by his majeſty out of <hi>Scotland</hi>) or to his ſon <hi>Thomas</hi> earl of <hi>Elgin.</hi> It continued for ſome time in his poſterity, earls of <hi>Elgin</hi> and of <hi>Ayleſbury.</hi> It became, about the year 1690 (by purchaſe) the property of lord <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> who built the houſe; which ſtill retains nearly the original form.

and built what is now called <hi>Houghton Houſe,</hi> and incloſed the park which goes by that name; and then <hi>Old Ampthill Park</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came only the ſecond park to the ſeat. The houſe is ſeated on a bold eminence, and commands a fine view. Two of the fronts are very beautiful; each has an elegant portico and loggio above. On the intervening ſpace are variety of cyphers, devices, and creſts; ſuch as bears and ragged ſtaves, ſtaves and palms, crowned lions and crowns, and beards of arrows, or hedge-hogs and porcupines<note n="*" place="bottom">In an old edition of the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> date 1629, is a hedge-hog, or porcupine, as a creſt to the top of a frontiſpiece. A proof, perhaps, of a <hi>Sydney</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the plan.</note>. Some of theſe certainly relate to the <hi>Sydnies.</hi> This gave riſe to the aſſertion of the editor of <hi>Cambden,</hi> that it was built by the counteſs of <hi>Pembroke,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Sydney</hi>'s ſiſter, <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s mother;</q>and that the model was contrived by her brother, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sir <hi>Philip Sydney,</hi> in his <hi>Arcadia.</hi> From the letters on the ſouth front, I. R. with a crown over them, it is evident that the houſe was built in the time of <hi>James</hi> I; and, as there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe that <hi>Inigo Jones</hi> was the architect, it is poſſible that he might have been recommended by that lady, wife to <hi>William</hi> earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> one of <hi>Inigo</hi>'s great patrons; from whoſe deſigns the earl built the noble front of his ſeat at <hi>Wilton.</hi> Let this be admitted, we are not to wonder at ſeeing the devices, of her beloved brother ornamenting a place, with which ſhe might have no connections, but thoſe of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>THE portico and loggio are of ſtone, and ornamented with
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0369200900:419"/>
columns of the Doric and Ionic orders: the reſt of the houſe is of brick. The fronts are unequal; one being a hundred and twenty-two feet in extent; the other, only ſeventy-three feet ſix inches.</p>
               <p>THE houſe and manor were purchaſed by the late duke of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> from <hi>Charles</hi> earl of <hi>Ayleſbury,</hi> and with it the ſtewardſhip of the honor of <hi>Ampthill,</hi> hold under the crown.</p>
               <p>THIS place muſt not be confounded with <hi>Houghton Conqueſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">HOUGHTON CONQUEST.</note> a very antient houſe, at the foot of the hill.

               <p>AFTER a ſhort ride, I reached the large houſe of <hi>Wreſt,</hi> ſeated in a low and wet park, croſſed with formal rows of trees.

               <p>In the quarters of the wilderneſs are to be ſeen two cenotaphs, for the late duke and dutcheſs, erected by the duke himſelf: and, if you gain a ſteep aſcent, from the hill-houſe is a moſt extenſive view of the country.

               <p>THE old dining-room is moſt curiouſly furniſhed: mock pilaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters finiſhed with ſtripes of velvet, and worked ſilk feſtoons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each. This is ſaid to have been done for the reception of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN this apartment is the portrait of that eminent ſtateſman and honeſt man Sir <hi>William Temple:</hi> a copy from one by <hi>Lely;</hi> yet a moſt beautiful picture. He is placed ſitting, and looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, in a red veſt; his hair long, black, and flowing; his whiſkers ſmall. In his hand is the triple alliance: the greateſt act of his patriotic life; but ſoon fruſtrated by the profligate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the time.</p>
               <p>IN the chapel-cloſet is the glory of the name, lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LADY JANE GRAY.</note> the ſweet accompliſhed victim to the wickedneſs of her father-in-law, and the folly of her father. Her perſon was rather plain; but that was amply recompenſed by her intellectual charms. She was miſtreſs of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues; verſed in <hi>Hebrew,</hi>

                  <hi>Chaldee, Arabic, French,</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> ſkilled in muſic; and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at her needle. I have ſeen in the library at <hi>Zurich</hi> ſeveral of her letters, wrote in a moſt beautiful hand, to <hi>Bullenger,</hi> on the ſubject of religion; and a toilet, worked with her own hand, is preſerved there with great reverence. She fell at the age of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen. Could there be wanting any proof of her amazing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, it was ſupplied near her laſt moments with the moſt invincible one: — As ſhe was paſſing to the ſcaffold (whether by accident, or whether by the moſt cruel intention) ſhe met the headleſs body of her beloved huſband. A line in <hi>Greek,</hi> to the following purpoſe, was her conſolation: <q>That if his lifeleſs body ſhould give teſtimony againſt her before men, his moſt bleſſed ſoul ſhould give an eternal proof of her innocence in the preſence of GOD.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE dreſs of this ſuffering innocent is, a plain white cap, a handkerchief, faſtened under her arms, and a black gown: a book in her hand.</p>

This is the lady who is fabled to have died of the prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her finger with the needle, and who is ſhewn as ſuch in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> abbey. She looks as pale as if the fact was true. Her gown is finely flowered; her petticoat white and ſtriped; her robe lined with ermine; her veil vaſt and diſtended; her wedding-ring hanging from her wriſt by a ſilken ſtring.</p>

He was created lord <hi>Crew</hi> of <hi>Stene,</hi> in 1661, having been active in promoting the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and freeing his country from the confuſed government it had long labored under. No one was more active in defence of the liberties of his country, in the beginning of the troubles of the former reign, than himſelf.

He was

By the garter, in which one of the coats of arms is included, it is evident that the tomb was erected by the founder of the chapel.

               <p>FROM <hi>Luton</hi> I purſued my journey ſouthward: near the twenty-ſixth mile-ſtone, paſſed through the village of <hi>Hardin,</hi> or <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedon,</hi> and by its chapel, dependent on <hi>Whethamſted.</hi> This manor belonged, in 1292, to <hi>Robert Hoo,</hi> and continued in his line till the death of <hi>Thomas</hi> lord <hi>Hoo</hi> and <hi>Haſtings,</hi> about the latter end of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI; when it devolved to his three daughters <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>THE portrait of queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is extremely worth notice; <note place="margin">QUEEN ELIZABETH.</note> not only becauſe it is the handſomeſt we have of her, but as it points out her turn to allegory and apt devices. Her gown is cloſe-bodied: on her head is a coronet and long aigret, and a long diſtended gauze veil: her face is young; her hair yellow, falling in two long treſſes; her neck adorned with a pearl neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, her arms with bracelets. The lining of her robe is worked with eyes and ears, and on her left ſleeve is embroidered a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: all to imply wiſdom and vigilance.

               <q>HER death was infamous: and though ſhe died (as it were) in a corner (in ſo private a condition) the loathſomeneſs of her death made it as conſpicuous as on a houſe-top: for that part of her body which had been the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of moſt of her ſin, grown rotten (though ſhe never had but one child) the ligaments failing, it fell down, and was cut away in flakes, with a moſt nauſeous and putrid ſavour; which to augment, ſhe would roll herſelf in her own ordure in her bed; took delight in it. Thus her affections varied; for nothing could be found ſweet enough to augment her beauties at firſt, and nothing ſtinking enough to decypher her loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs at laſt. Pardon the ſharpneſs of theſe expreſſions; for they are for the glory of God; who often makes his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments (in the balance of his juſtice) of equal weight with our ſins. <bibl>

This ſhe made good, by her exemplary piety &amp; regular devotion in her chappel; whereto ſhe obliged all her domeſticks, every morning &amp; evening, to attend her.</p>
               <p>And, ſurviving her own monument 45 years, ſhe had time to raiſe to herſelf a more laſting one, by reſtoring the fortune of this illuſtrious family, which ſhe found under an eclipſe, to near the height of it's antient ſplendour.</p>
               <p>This ſhe effected by her wiſe conduct &amp; large acquiſitions, &amp; by the advantageous diſpoſal of her only ſon <hi>Anthony</hi> earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> in marriage, with <hi>Mary,</hi> ſole daughter and heireſs of the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
