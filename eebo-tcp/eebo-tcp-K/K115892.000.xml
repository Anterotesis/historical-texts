            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ENCOURAGED by the approbation of ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and conſidering that any uſeful diſcovery, in the healing art, though ever ſo trifling, muſt be of ſervice to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I determined to commit to the preſs the following very imperfect ESSAY. The diſorder is not indeed new, though very little has been given to the world on the ſubject; this may be ſome excuſe for my attempt, and if my unpoliſhed language does not diſguſt, I am not without hopes that the mode of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I recommend will meet with a favourable reception. If it be otherwiſe, conſcious of having done what I thought my duty, I ſhall rejoice if ſomething better ſhould be publiſhed hereafter. To ſuch as know more let me apply

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE RETROVERSION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE diſeaſe which is the ſubject of the following ſheets, is neither generally known, nor hath it been fully treated of by any author I have read; which ſeems rather remarkable in this enlightened age, when the induſtry and abilities of many of the faculty ſhine forth ſo conſpicuouſly, eſpecially as the diſorder is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and often proves fatal. There are indeed ſome caſes in print,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Medical Obſervations and Inquiries, Vol. IV. and V.</note> which authenticate the diſeaſe, and partially deſcribe its ſymptoms; but, in my humble opinion, no remedy hath hitherto been diſcloſed which perfectly meets the evil, or is adequate to the removal of it.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0923600600:6"/>
            <p>DR. HUNTER, in his remarks on the retroverted uterus, aſſerts, that the very exiſtence of ſuch a caſe has been controverted. But, having myſelf met with a conſiderable number, in the courſe of thirty years practice, I am induced to believe, that this dreadful malady occurs more frequently than the faculty in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuppoſes. Nor do I apprehend that many of our practitioners, in the remote parts of the country at leaſt, ſuſpect it to happen till it is too late to adminiſter relief; for the diſorder, if long neglected, will moſt probably terminate fatally, as too clearly appears by the ſecond caſe hereafter to be related; and the event will be the ſame if it ſhould chance to be miſtaken. Here I muſt obſerve, that when I was a ſtudent under the late cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated anatomiſt abovementined, in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeven hundred and fifty-four, a caſe of this ſort occurred to him; and the Doctor, in a lecture extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, which he gave to the faculty, with the parts before him, treated it as a new caſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">This caſe has been communicated to the public.</note> without aſſigning any ſatisfactory cauſe, or pointing out any competent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0923600600:7"/>remedy. The opinion he formed of it afterwards may be ſeen in his remarks;<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Obſervations and Inquiries. Vol. V. Page 388.</note> which, however, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me when I hit upon my method of cure; and I muſt add, that ſince the year 1754, I have never heard ſuch a caſe mentioned in converſation by any of the faculty, except once, by Mr. Hey of Leeds, a gentleman in extenſive practice, who is a very accurate obſerver, and an ornament to his profeſſion.</p>
            <p>FOR my own part, I have made no ſecret of the facts I have met with; but, on proper occaſions, made known to ſome of the faculty all thoſe caſes which have fallen immediately under my own care, together with my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon them: and as I have been the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, under Providence, of relieving many afflicted perſons in this complaint, I thought it a duty incumbent on me to communicate to the public that method of cure which I have found effectual; hoping that it will be of ſervice to young practitioners in midwifery, and poſſibly not unacceptable to thoſe of longer experience.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0923600600:8"/>
            <p>PERHAPS I may not be able to make myſelf clearly underſtood in the deſcriptive part, but ſhall endeavour to ſurmount that difficulty as well as I can, and ſhall honeſtly propoſe the remedies which I believe to be effectual.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, then, I ſhall give the general ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the diſorder, from the time when they become ſpecific and unequivocal, till the happy or fatal termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with an anatomical explanation of the uterus, in its retroverted ſtate, when the diſorder has taken place.</p>
            <p>AFTERWARDS I ſhall ſubmit to the reader what I take to be the proper treatment of the diſorder; and will farther venture to add my ideas as to the cauſe of it, grounded upon a number of caſes which have fallen under my own immediate obſervation; and will take occaſion to ſhew the neceſſity of diſcovering the diſorder in as early a ſtage as poſſible.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0923600600:9"/>
            <p>I WOULD firſt generally obſerve that all the patients labouring under this complaint, whom I have been called to aſſiſt, were of relaxed habits of body, and that every one of them, when advanced into the third month of pregnancy, began to complain of making water with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, which before that time they had not properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, generally attributing this complaint to their having been interrupted in the doing of it, or otherwiſe diſappointed of obeying the firſt calls of nature.</p>
            <p>THIS difficulty of making water, when the uterus is inverted, daily increaſes, and is attended with a dull pain about the ſymphyſis of the oſſa pubis, until nearly a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſuppreſſion of urine takes place.</p>
            <p>FROM that time the pain about the ſymphyſis of the pubis becomes more and more acute. To theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſucceeds a great difficulty in going to ſtool, with a bearing down pain through the whole pelvis; every one of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0923600600:10"/>which evils continue to increaſe, and at laſt no feces can be got rid of without the aid of clyſters.</p>
            <p>BY the time the patient has advanced to the latter end of the third, or beginning of the fourth month of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, aſſiſtance is generally called for. But ſhould the diſorder continue many days longer undiſcovered, the danger increaſes ſo as in a ſhort time to make the cure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly difficult, if not impoſſible; and then the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means of ſaving the life of the patient in this ſtage of the diſorder, in my opinion, are thoſe ſuggeſted in my remarks on the ſecond caſe, and which I believe will be found generally practicable, and, for the moſt part, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>HAVING been informed of all ſymptoms the patient can deſcribe, if they correſpond to thoſe mentioned in the 5th page, and the beginning of this, a very probable conjecture may be formed of the caſe, which to aſcertain more clearly, the following mode of examination may be tried.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0923600600:11"/>
            <p>LET the patient lie down on one ſide, with her back to you, and her knees drawn up towards the abdomen. Whilſt ſhe is in this poſition, the os externum muſt be paſſed with the fore finger; and the lower part of the vagina, towards the os coccygis, will be found greatly diſtended, and upon the ſtretch from ſide to ſide, ſo as to prevent it from collapſing upon the finger. This is occaſioned by a tumor preſenting itſelf at the lower part of the os ſacrum, which totally impedes the finger in its paſſage to the hollow of the ſame bone, where you might expect to find the os internum; but by paſſing the finger up to the ſymphyſis of the pubis, there the collum utere will be diſcovered, greatly ſhortened of its natural length, and cloſely preſſed againſt the upper part of the pubis, into the form of a round button, of the thickneſs of about half an inch, the os internum opening but little.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS in this ſtate, the ſhape and form of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum uteri cannot be better deſcribed than by comparing it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0923600600:12"/>with a muſhroom juſt beginning to open, the concave ſide thereof being towards the pubis.</p>
            <p>AFTERWARDS, by paſſing the finger up the rectum, you find the tumor, betwixt the rectum and vagina, which is the fundus uteri inverted downwards, and fallen into that ſituation.</p>
            <p>THESE particulars being aſcertained, a perſon is then perfectly maſter of the ſubject; and by carefully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and ſteadily purſuing the following general direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there will be little doubt of a cure, by replacing the uterus in it's natural ſituation.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh this deſirable end, I recommend the following method, which I never found inadequate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the deſperate inſtance which is recorded in the ſecond caſe, and where it would have been abſurd to make the attempt.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0923600600:13"/>
            <p>THE catheter muſt be paſſed, and all the water drawn off; which is not attended with much difficulty. It will be afterwards proper that a clyſter be adminiſtered, in order to free the rectum entirely of feces. But in doing of this moſt commonly greater oppoſition is met with than was expected, by reaſon of the fundus uteri preſſing the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cloſe to the os ſacrum:—theſe impediments, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being removed, the patient ſhould have ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cordial to ſupport her, and alſo a little time to recover the fatigue which ſhe has neceſſarily undergone.</p>
            <p>I COME now to the operation itſelf. Place three or four pillows upon the floor by the bedſide, upon which the patient muſt reſt her head and arms; at the ſame time, let her be well ſupported by two or three female friends, reſting her knees upon the edge of the bed, which ſhould not be a high one. The operator muſt then be placed upon the bed, behind the patient, taking care not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the leaſt expoſure, and gradually dilate the os exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, until the hand can be paſſed into the vagina; which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0923600600:14"/>done, let him bend the thumb into the palm of the hand, reſting its point juſt betwixt the roots of the little and third finger; then cloſe all his fingers upon the thumb, which brings the hand into the ſmalleſt compaſs poſſible; and in this poſition great power and ſtability will be given to the three firſt fingers, with which every effort muſt be made, by oppoſing the knuckles and middle parts of theſe fingers to the tumor or fundus uteri, and as near to the ſymphyſis of the pubis as may be, keeping in mind an exact idea of the ſituation of the upper part of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum; and towards that part directing his whole preſſure, which muſt be conſiderable.</p>
            <p>BY perſevering in this mode, the os internum is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what drawn, by the vagina, towards its natural ſituation, which aſſiſts in the reduction. If the firſt efforts prove abortive, the attempt muſt be repeated and iterated, till the tumor is found to recede; which muſt be followed up, till the fundus uteri turns over; when it will appear that it has regained its proper and natural ſituation. For
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0923600600:15"/>it will be immediately diſcovered, that the os internum is moved from the ſymphyſis of the pubis to the hollow of the ſacrum.</p>
            <p>IF it be aſked what force is neceſſary to apply in reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uterus, ſo wedged in the pelvis, I know of no better mode to anſwer than by referring to a caſe in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, where the foetus muſt be turned, when the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are broke, the liquor amnii is diſcharged, and the uterus contracted. All who practice in the obſtetric art muſt be ſenſible of the great power required to effect this; ſo much force I have found to be neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the inverted gravid uterus.</p>
            <p>AFTER the operation the patient muſt be put to bed, and take an opiate, and ſhould continue eight or ten days without being moved therefrom. During this time ſhe muſt be ſupported with light nouriſhing diet, and avoid all force either in making water or going to ſtool.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0923600600:16"/>
            <p>AT the expiration of this period, if no miſcarriage hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, upon examining the parts, not only the os inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num will be found in its proper ſituation, but the collum uteri reſtored to its natural form; and at the ſame time, as the uterus and foetus will have acquired a conſiderable bulk, ſo as to reſt upon the brim of the pelvis, there can be little danger of a relapſe; at leaſt I never experienced any.</p>
            <p>AS the late Dr. Hunter, in the Lecture which I have mentioned in the beginning of this paper, did not give any opinion reſpecting the cauſe of the diſorder; and as I have not at any time ſince, either heard or read of it's being accouted for by any one, what follows upon the ſubject I ſubmit with the greateſt deference, as the reſult of my own obſervation and experience; hoping that it will at leaſt induce others, who are more competent and have better opportunity, more fully to inveſtigate this ſubject, which I could wiſh, for the good of ſociety to be perfectly well underſtood.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0923600600:17"/>
            <p>IT has been before obſerved that all thoſe who have been afflicted by this diſorder, at leaſt all whom I have ſeen, were of relaxed habits of body<note n="*" place="bottom">I have an obſervation to add, that ſeems to confirm this idea of the diſorder being peculiar to relaxed habits; namely, that ſeveral of the patients whom I have attended and cured of this complaint, in ſome time after have died of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</note>: and that, when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in their third month of pregnancy, they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a difficulty in making water; to which at firſt they paid little or no attention, ſuppoſing it to have been either natural in their then condition, or occaſioned by not having obeyed the calls of nature; thus contenting themſelves, until the increaſing difficulty, terminating in a ſuppreſſion of urine, obliges them to ſend for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I BELIEVE it will be allowed me, that in all ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, every part of the body is equally ſubject in a certain degree to the conſequences of relaxation; which granted, it ſeems not unreaſonable to imagine that the ligaments of the uterus, ſo circumſtanced, muſt be in a more flaccid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0923600600:18"/>ſtate than is natural in a robuſt habit of body; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the uterus is more looſely ſuſpended in the pelvis, and extremely liable to motion from any preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural preſſure or impulſe. In ſuch a ſituation then, if there be either a difficulty in making water or a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of urine, no matter by what cauſe occaſioned, the bladder will be preternaturally diſtended, and preſſing in every direction, as it riſes in the pelvis, and above the ſymphyſis of the pubis, the ligaments of the uterus muſt give way, and the fundus uteri is thereby forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede. But we find by experience, in every caſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in making water, that the bladder ſcarce ever has the power of diſcharging the whole of it's contents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance. And in all ſuch caſes, that difficulty, not being at firſt ſufficiently attended to, hourly increaſes, till it ends in a total ſuppreſſion: In our caſe, by parity of reaſoning, the bladder becomes daily more and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended, and the preſſure againſt and over the fundus uteri muſt be continually increaſing, from the ſize and weight of the bladder, by the power of which the fundus is forced
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0923600600:19"/>back and downwards in the pelvis, between the vagina and rectum, as hath been before deſcribed. And when this has once taken place, it is impoſſible for the uterus to return to its natural ſituation without aſſiſtance. To ſuch canſes, how ſlight ſoever in the begining, do I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the whole of this dire miſchief: on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have always moſt earneſtly recommended to pregnant women not to wait after, but rather to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the calls of nature.</p>
            <p>Four caſes, which I have ſelected out of a conſiderable number that fell under my care, are added by way of Appendix to this little Eſſay; and will, I hope, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirm the account I have attempted to give of this formidable complaint.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX; CONTAINING FOUR REMARKABLE CASES OF THE GRAVID UTERUS INVERTED.</head>
            <div n="1" type="case_study">
               <head>CASE THE FIRST.</head>
               <p>ON the eighteenth day of Auguſt, one thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty-eight, I was ſent for to Margaret, the wife of George Sharp, of Knottingley, three miles diſtant from Pontefract, in the county of York. She complained of great pain in her body, from a ſuppreſſion of urine, which had been increaſing for ſeveral days,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0923600600:21"/>with an odd dull pain at the ſymphyſis of the os pubis; but ſhe did not ſuppoſe it would lead to any bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, believing the whole to have been occaſioned by not making water at a time when ſhe had a preſſing call to it, a few days before the complaint began: ſhe was then about three months gone with child.—I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make her ſenſible of the neceſſity of paſſing the catheter, with which ſhe complied; and, after drawing off two quarts of water, I ordered her ſome diuretic medicines, and preſcribed an opiate to be taken at bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. I viſited her again the next day, and found ſhe had enjoyed an eaſy night, and had voided more water than for ſeveral days before.—I then recommended to her to continue the diuretic medicines, to keep her body open, and to take the opiate occaſionally. But on the twenty-ſeventh I was ſent for again, and found her much worſe. She now complained of great pain in the pelvis, and could neither void water nor evacuate any thing by ſtool;—I again drew off the very ſame quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as before, and ordered her a clyſter, which anſwered
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0923600600:22"/>the intention, and gave her great eaſe. But imagining that ſhe was about to miſcarry, I was deſirous to examine her; to this end, having paſſed the os externum with my finger, I was ſurpriſed to find that I could by no means proceed in the uſual manner gently up the vagina towards the ſacrum, in ſearch of the os internum, being obſtructed by a tumor at the lower extremity of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum, which ſtretched the vagina from ſide to ſide. I then paſſed my finger up the rectum, which I perceived was preſſed cloſe to the ſacrum, by this tumor, ſituated betwixt the vagina and rectum; then advancing my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the ſymphyſis of the pubis, found there the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum uteri preſſed into a flat form, ſomething like a middle ſized muſhroom juſt beginning to open. From all theſe circumſtances, and at the ſame time recollecting the caſe given by Dr. Hunter, in the year 1754, I was convinced that this tumor could be nothing but the fundus uteri in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0923600600:23"/>
               <p>THIS being the firſt caſe of the kind which had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in my practice, I was led to attempt a reduction of the uterus, in the manner which the Doctor had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; but, after ſeveral vain attempts, was obliged to leave her, only preſcribing an opiate, till the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>In the intermediate time, having conſidered the caſe in every point of view, as far as I was able, with a female pelvis, and Doctor Smellie's tables before me, theſe being the only ſources from which I could then derive any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I determined upon the method of treatment already given at large, which at my next viſit I put in practice. The firſt attempt failed, but I was happy enough to ſucceed in a ſecond effort, and reduced the uterus into its natural ſituation. This was done on the twenty-eighth of Auguſt, ten days after my firſt ſeeing the patient.</p>
               <p>AFTERWARDS ſhe went on in her pregnancy without any further inconvenience, and had a natural and eaſy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0923600600:24"/>labour; nor did any evil happen in conſequence of the complaint. And ſeveral years after, when I called acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally at the houſe, I found both her and the child in good health.</p>

               <head>CASE THE SECOND.</head>
               <p>ON the twelfth of December, 1759, I was deſired by a gentleman of the Faculty to attend the wife of Andrew Montier, of Knottingley, ſuppoſed to be then in a fit of the ſtone or gravel. Being that day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, I recommended what I thought moſt proper from the information given me, and deſired if ſhe was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the preſcription, to be informed, in order that I might viſit her.—I heard no more of the caſe from that day until the ſeventh of January 1760, when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to go and ſee her. I then found her advanced five months in her pregnancy, and in a moſt deplorable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0923600600:26"/>ſhe informed me that for a month paſt ſhe had been in conſtant pain, which firſt began with a difficulty of making water, and a trifling pain about the neck of the bladder; for which her midwife ordered her ſomething, and ſhe had alſo taken medicines from her apothecary, in hopes to carry it off, but to no purpoſe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the pain increaſed every day, a ſuppreſſion of urine came on, and it was with difficulty ſhe could part with any ſtool for ſome time paſt: that about the twenty-ninth of December the pain in her body was very great; and, as ſhe expreſſed it, bore down violently; and as ſhe could neither diſcharge urine nor ſtool, that ſhe had ſent again for her midwife, believing ſhe was going to miſcarry, who ſtaid with her ſome time, and gave every aſſiſtance in her power by opiates, clyſters, &amp;c. notwithſtanding which her ſufferings hourly increaſed with ſickneſs and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; nay, for twenty-four hours before I ſaw her, ſhe had vomited up what ought to have gone down.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0923600600:27"/>
               <p>I FOUND her ſunk and emaciated to the laſt degree; her pulſe ſcarcely to be felt, and this attended with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent faintings, cold ſweats, and a cadaverous ſmell. But for a few hours preceding my viſit, the pains in the pelvis had left her.</p>
               <p>IN this moſt miſerable ſituation I doubted whether or no I ſhould attempt any thing; but, for ſatisfaction to myſelf, as her body was greatly diſtended, I paſſed the catheter, and drew off five pints of a dark grumous cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-coloured water, which towards the latter end was bloody.</p>
               <p>AFTER this I paſſed the os externum with my finger, and found the fundus uteri in the vagina, below the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the os coccygis, preſſing the perinoeum, and the anus dilated the breadth of a ſhilling, the parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging a moſt offenſive matter. With ſome difficulty I paſſed my finger up to the ſymphyſis of the pubis, where I found the collum uteri preſſed quite flat againſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0923600600:28"/>the pubis, at the very brim of the pelvis, the os inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num being open the breadth of a ſixpence. But the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor preſſed the rectum ſo cloſe to the os ſacrum, that I could not paſs the os coccygis with my finger.</p>
               <p>THESE parts being in a ſtate of mortification, all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempts were vain:—I thought it my duty however, before I left her, to make the apothecary and midwife who attended, perfectly ſenſible of the diſorder being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. The poor creature expired next day.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>THIS dreadful caſe naturally led me to conſider what relief might have been given to the patient before the parts were ſo injured as to leave no hopes of recovery, i. e. before the mortification had taken place.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0923600600:29"/>
                  <p>THE means which then occurred to me as the only probable and practicable ones, in ſo deſperate a ſituation, were theſe;—firſt to draw off the water and clear the rectum of feces:—ſecondly, to endeavour by ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to rupture the membranes, and diſcharge the liquor amnii, which would greatly reduce the uterus in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and having gained theſe two points, then at laſt to attempt a reduction in the way I have in general recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p>In every caſe that hath occurred to me in practice, I have always been able to reach the os internum with my finger, and clearly to diſcover its form and ſituation. I have not therefore any doubt, even in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the collum uteri is flat, and the os internum opens a little, that I could, by perſevering in my efforts, paſs the os internum with my finger, and rupture the membranes; at leaſt the trial in a caſe of ſuch imminent danger is warrantable. For it might ſave the patient, and could do no injury. But ſhould it prove impracticable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0923600600:30"/>with the finger, then I think it would be right to make the attempt with a female catheter, or ſome inſtrument of that kind, having a point much more curved or hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                  <p>IN doing this, whilſt I had one ſinger at the os inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, I would paſs the inſtrument up on one ſide of the ſymphyſis of the pubis, with the point towards the other ſide; and, when advanced as high in the pelvis as the os internum, inſinuate the point into it; and then, by puſhing the point downwards, and againſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, rupture them, and ſo diſcharge the liquor amnii. After which the reduction ſhould immediately be ſet about as in general directed.</p>
                  <p>THESE are ſpeculative ſuggeſtions only thrown out for others of kappier talents to improve upon. But were a caſe of this deſcription to fall under my care, even though the os internum ſhould not be at all open, I would moſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0923600600:31"/>certainly adopt the mode of proceeding now deſcribed, without the leaſt doubt of ſucceſs.—This at leaſt, I can affirm, is the only caſe that has occurred to me, in which I did not ſave the patient.</p>

               <head>CASE THE THIRD.</head>
               <p>ON the eighteenth of September, 1761, James Hunter of Ledſham, ſix miles from Pontefract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his wife was about to miſcarry, called on me to viſit her, as the midwife of the place, who was with her, could give no aſſiſtance, and was at a loſs what to do.</p>
               <p>As it was then late in the evening I ſent her an opiate; and viſiting her in the morning following, was glad to hear from herſelf that ſhe was better; which ſhe attributed to having made more water than uſual; but at the ſame
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0923600600:33"/>time ſhe told me, ſhe had been labouring for many days under a difficulty of making water, attended with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common pain about the neck of the bladder; that for the three or four laſt days ſhe could make little or none, nor could ſhe have a ſtool without the aſſiſtance of medicine, and concluded with ſaying that ſhe had had a great deal of bearing-down pain in her body which hourly increaſed. All this ſhe ſuppoſed was owing to her condition, being her firſt pregnancy.</p>
               <p>FROM this information I concluded what the caſe was, and upon examination found the uterus inverted in the manner I have already deſcribed. I therefore drew off the water, evacuated the rectum, and ſet about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction exactly as I have generally directed.</p>
               <p>BUT I did not find it an caſy taſk, as the force requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to be employed was very great: however, at the third effort I ſucceeded, and the uterus reverted into its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſituation.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0923600600:34"/>
               <p>AFTER ſhe had continued in bed a week, I found the parts in their proper form and ſituation; and no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of abortion appeared. She even went on to her full time, without any kind of inconvenience, and on the eighteenth of March, 1762, ſhe had a natural labour; when, being again ſent for, I delivered her of a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all did well.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:0923600600:35"/>
               <head>CASE THE FOURTH.</head>
               <p>ON the twenty-ſixth day of February, 1764, I was called to the ſame patient a ſecond time, whom I found in the like ſituation as before; only according to her own reckoning, a little farther advanced in her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; and though ſhe had ſo lately experienced the very ſame complaint, yet on this occaſion ſhe did not apprehend any dangerous conſequence, believing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to proceed merely from holding her water too long, which did not by any means appear a ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0923600600:36"/>
               <p>AFTER taking every previous ſtep to facilitate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the uterus, I ſet about it in the uſual way; but found the uterus ſo faſt wedged in the pelvis, that I was obliged to make many efforts before I could accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the reduction, the force required being very great. And I muſt obſerve, that immediately before the uterus receded, a ſmart guſh of water came down upon my hand, which at the inſtant I ſuppoſed could be nothing but the liquor amnii: of which I was convinced by what followed. The uterus being replaced, the patient was put to bed, and the uſual directions given. But when I called upon her four days after, I diſcovered ſymptoms of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching miſcarriage, which I foretold, and it accordingly happened the next day. My patient ſoon recovered, and in a ſhort time after removed to a town called Kippax, about two miles diſtant, in a high dry ſituation, where ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a more robuſt habit of body. Since that time ſhe has had ſeveral children, without any return of the retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſio uteri, and now lives at Kippax in perfect health, March the firſt, 1785.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0923600600:37"/>
               <p>I SHALL conclude with remarking that I could produce a conſiderable number of other caſes, in which the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid uterus has been retroverted, that have fallen under my own immediate care; but as they contain nothing new, differ very little in their ſymptoms from the Firſt, Third, or Fourth; and being treated exactly in the ſame way, terminated happily; I forbear to enumerate them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it would only give the reader unneceſſary trouble.</p>
