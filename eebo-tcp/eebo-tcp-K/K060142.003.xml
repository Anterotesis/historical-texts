            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0141100403:3"/>
               <hi>Lincoln</hi> is an antient City, govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſo full of the Ruins of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and Religious Houſes, that the very Barns, Stables, Out-houſes, and, as they ſhew'd me, ſome of the very Hog-ſtyes, are built Church-faſhion; that is to ſay, with Stone-Walls, and arch'd Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Doors. Here are 13 Churches, but the meaneſt to look on that are any-where to be ſeen. The Cathedral indeed, and the Ruins of the old Caſtle, are very venerable Pieces of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lincoln</hi> was a Colony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by them nam'd <hi>Lindum Colonia,</hi> which very eaſily falls into the preſent abbreviated Appellation, <hi>Lincoln.</hi> From its bold and noble Situation upon an high Hill, it ſeems a Collection of Five Cities. For, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Hill, and Weſtward of the City, the River throws itſelf into a great Pool called <hi>Swan-pool,</hi> from the Multitude of Swans upon it. All around this Place the Ground is moory, and full of Bogs and Iſlets; and the Place is called now <hi>Carham,</hi> i. e. a Dwelling upon the <hi>Car,</hi> or Fen. Here was the <hi>Britiſh</hi> City in the moſt early Times, which they uſed as a Faſtneſs for themſelves and Cattle in Times of deep Diſtreſs. From this <hi>Carham</hi> is a pleaſant View of the Weſt-Front of the Cathedral.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Romans,</hi> pleas'd with this Eminence, placed their City upon it, which they firſt built in the Form of a large Square, the Southern Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently ſecur'd by the Precipice. Quite round the other Three Sides they carried a deep Trench, which ſtill remains, except on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt Angle. This City was divided into Four equal Parts by Two croſs Streets. The Two Southern Quarters were taken up, one by the Caſtle, the other by the Church which <hi>Remigius</hi> built. But when Biſhop <hi>Alexander</hi> projected a Structure of much larger Dimenſions, the Incloſure was carried beyond the Eaſtern Bounds of the City, and a new Wall built
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0141100403:4"/>
farther that way, as at preſent, with Battlements and Towers. The North <hi>Roman</hi> Gate of this Part of the City ſtill remains intire, call'd <hi>Newport</hi> Gate, and the nobleſt Remnant of this Sort in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> It is a vaſt Semicircle of Stones laid together without Morter, and cemented only by their wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Shape. This magnificent Arch is 16 Feet Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, the Stones Four Feet thick at Bottom. From this Gate Eaſtward ſome Part of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Wall is to be ſeen, made of Stone, and very ſtrong Mortar. The Weſt Gate towards the Gallows was pulled down within Memory. That on the South Side ſtill ſhews one Jamb from between the Houſes, and two or three Stones of the ſame Make as the former: the reſt has been pull'd down by Mr. <hi>Houghton.</hi> On the Eaſt Side one Poſtern is viſible, and big enough for a Bed to ſtand in. By <hi>Newport</hi> Gate is another large and curious Piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Workmanſhip, call'd the Mint-wall. This is ſtill 16 Feet high, and above 40 Feet long, compoſed of Brick and Stone, laid alternately.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Romans,</hi> finding this City well ſituated for Navigation, added another to it as big as the former. This they did Southward upon the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Hill, and ſo made it parallel with the other; and the moſt Southern Side lay upon the River. Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Ditch without is turn'd into a broad Street call'd <hi>The Beaſt-Market,</hi> and there below <hi>Claſkgate</hi> a great Part of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Wall is left, made of Stone. One Piece of it is now 80 Feet long, and 18 high. A little of it lower down is 12 Feet long, and as much high. Between that Gate upwards, and the old City-wall, by the <hi>Greeſtone-ſtairs,</hi> the old Ditch call'd <hi>Weredyke,</hi> is to be ſeen. To the Weſt the Ditch and Foundation of the Wall are ſtill loſt tho' many times repaired and demoliſhed in the frequent Sieges this Town has ſuſtain'd, eſpecially in the Wars of the Empreſs <hi>Maud.</hi> At the Bottom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0141100403:5"/>
of it, towards the Water, is a round Tower, named <hi>Lucy-tower,</hi> much known in her Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another great Addition to the Length of this City, Northward above the Hill, was call'd <hi>Newport,</hi> or the new City, 500 Paces long. This probably was done in the Time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. It lies on both Sides the <hi>Hermen-ſtreet,</hi> and was fenc'd with a Wall and Ditch hewn out of the Rock. At the Two farther Corners were round Towers, and a Gate, the Foundations of which remain. There were ſeveral Churches, and religious Houſes, in this Place. It was chiefly inhabited by <hi>Jews,</hi> who had ſettled here in great Numbers, and grown rich by Trade. There is a Well ſtill nam'd <hi>Grantham's-well,</hi> from a Child they impiouſly crucified, as was ſaid, and threw it into that Place.</p>
            <p n="5">5. After the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, when a great Part of the firſt City was turn'd into a Caſtle, by King <hi>William</hi> I. it is probable they added the laſt Intake Southward in the Angle of the <hi>Witham,</hi> and made a new Cut call'd <hi>Sinſil-dyke</hi> on the South and Eaſt Side for its Security. It is obſervable, that the <hi>Normans</hi> could not well pronounce <hi>Lincoln,</hi> but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated it to <hi>Nichol,</hi> as we find it written in ſome old Authors: and to this Day a Part of the <hi>Swan-pool</hi> is call'd <hi>Nichol-pool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' ſince thoſe Times the City has much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, of late it ſeems to revive, and Trade and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures to flouriſh.</p>
            <p>In this laſt Part of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> on both Sides the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Road, were many of that People's funeral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents; ſome of which they now dig up. There is an Inſcription of that Sort behind the Houſe where the Lord <hi>Huſſey</hi> was beheaded for Rebellion in the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. The great Bow-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, thro' which he paſs'd to the Scaffold, was lately taken down. It ſtands over-againſt another Stone Building, of an antique Model, which was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0141100403:6"/>
the Palace of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who lived here in Royal State, and had the Privilege of Coining. His Arms are here carv'd in Stone. Over-againſt the Caſtle, Weſtward, is an Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by King <hi>Stephen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Situation of the City, from what I have ſaid, muſt appear very particular; one Part is on the flat, and in a Bottom, ſo that the <hi>Witham,</hi> a little River, that runs through the Town, flows ſometimes into the Street: the other Part lies upon the Top of a high Hill, where the Cathedral ſtands; and the very ſteepeſt Part of the Aſcent of the Hill, is the beſt Part of the City for Trade and Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more troubleſome than the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the upper and lower Town; the Street is ſo ſteep and ſo ſtrait, that the Coaches and Horſes are oblig'd to fetch a Compaſs another Way, as well on one Hand as on the other.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Witham</hi> is arch'd over, ſo that you ſee nothing of it as you go through the main Street; but it makes a large Lake on the Weſt Side, and has a Canal, called the <hi>Poſs-dike,</hi> by which it has a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the <hi>Trent,</hi> whereby the Navigation of that River is made uſeful for Trade to the City. This River muſt have run into the <hi>Humber,</hi> had it not been broken off in the Middle by that great Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley under <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and turned into the Salt-marſhes. Hence it is that the Stone upon this Weſtern Cliff is full of Sea-ſhells. For the Shell-fiſh, when by the reſtleſs Motion of the Waters in the univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, they were carried into the midland Places, were hinder'd by the Weight of their Shells from regaining their original Stations; and thus were confin'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the growing Stone. As a Teſtimony of which the Skeleton of a Crocodile, or ſome ſuch Animal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a broad flat Stone, was ſent to the Royal Society from theſe Parts, by Dr. <hi>Stukeley,</hi> from whom we borrow this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0141100403:7"/>There are very good Buildings in the upper City, and ſeveral Families of Gentlemen have Houſes there, beſides thoſe of the Prebendaries and other Clergy belonging to the Cathedral.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is a magnificent Fabrick, and is reputed the largeſt in Extent of any Cathedral in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>York.</hi> But there are in it many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Blemiſhes, which I ſhall particularly take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, in comparing it hereafter with <hi>York</hi> Minſter. The Situation is infinitely to its Advantage, as it ſtands upon a high Hill, and is ſeen into five or ſix Counties. It has a double Croſs or Tranſept. The Weſt End receives a great Addition to its Breadth, by reaſon of Two Chapels on each Side of the Side-Ayles; but the Two Towers and Spires are very mean, tho' not for want of Height.</p>
            <p>This Cathedral has many Bells; and particularly the Northern Tower is filled up, as one may ſay, with the fineſt great Bell in <hi>England,</hi> which is called <hi>Tom of Lincoln,</hi> being probably conſecrated to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.—As loud as Tom of Lincoln</hi> is a Proverb. It weighs 4 Tons, 1894 Pounds, and will hold 424 Gallons Ale-meaſure; the Circumference is 22 Feet 8 Inches.</p>
            <p>The Middle or Rood Tower is the higheſt in the whole Kingdom, and when the Spire was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, it muſt, in Proportion to the Height of the Tower, have exceeded that of old <hi>St. Paul's,</hi> which was 520 Feet. The Monks were ſo proud of this Structure, that they would have it, that the Devil looked upon it with an envious Eye; whence the Proverb of a Man who looks invidious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, <hi>He looks as the Devil over Lincoln.</hi> At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there are only four very ordinary Pinacles, one at each Corner. It has Two great Gate-houſes or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances from the Weſt. The lower Part of the Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t, and of the Two Towers, are of <hi>Remigius</hi>'s Building, as is eaſily diſcoverable by the Colour of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0141100403:8"/>
the Stones, and by the Manner of Architecture: but <hi>Alexander</hi> built the Additions upon it, as likewiſe the Body of the Cathedral, the Choir, and <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s Tower, which once had a very lofty Spire. St. <hi>Hugh</hi> the <hi>Burgundian</hi> built the Eaſt End, or <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s Chapel, (where he had a Shrine) and the Chapter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, which is ceil'd with a beautiful Stone Roof, and one Pillar in the Middle.</p>
            <p>The Cloiſters and the Library are fine; and the latter is well furniſhed with printed Books and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts.</p>
            <p>Two Catharine-wheel Windows, as they are term'd, at the Ends of the larger Tranſepts, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fine for Bullion-work, and painted Glaſs.</p>
            <p>Here are great Numbers of antique Braſſes and Monuments.</p>
            <p>South of the Church, upon the very Brow of the Hill, is the Biſhop's Palace, built by <hi>Robert de Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> who gave Two great Bells. Biſhop <hi>Bek,</hi> and other Succeſſors, improv'd it into a Magnificence equal to the Cathedral. It ſtands juſt South of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall. It had many large Bow-windows of curious Workmanſhip, looking over the lower City into <hi>Nottinghamſhire.</hi> The Kitchen had Seven Chimneys. The Hall was ſtately. The Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe remains intire with the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">

               </gap> of the Founders. This Palace was ruined in the Time of the Civil Wars; but might be rebuilt with no very great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. As the Church is very large, ſo is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Biſhoprick, which was formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely great, as may be ſeen by the <hi>Monaſticon,</hi> where is an aſtoniſhing Account of the Wealth of the Place.</p>
            <p>The Church, as it is the Seat of the Biſhoprick, is not ſo antient as ſome others; the See being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, from <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> a little Town in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> on the River <hi>Thames,</hi> not far from <hi>Tame,</hi> of which I have ſpoken in its
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0141100403:9"/>
Place; but the City is truly antient, and the Ruins of it tell us as much.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, King <hi>Vortimer,</hi> the valiant <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> dy'd here, and was buried in the Church of the great Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>It is certain, as I have obſerv'd, that <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> built the Caſtle, to curb the potent Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and the Ruins ſhew, that it was a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Work, well fortify'd, and capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a numerous Gariſon.</p>
            <p>The Biſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln</hi> at that Time contain'd all that now is compris'd in the Dioceſes of <hi>Ely, Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> beſides what is now its own; and 'tis ſtill the largeſt Dioceſe in <hi>England</hi>; containing the ſeveral Counties of <hi>Lincoln, Leiceſter, Huntingdon, Bedford, Bucks,</hi> and Part of <hi>Hertford</hi>; and in them 1255 Pariſhes, whereof 577 are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations; and there are in theſe Bounds ſix Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, <hi>viz. Lincoln, Leiceſter, Bedford, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Stow,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was the famous Battle fought between the Friends of the Empreſs <hi>Maud,</hi> Mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> II. and King <hi>Stephen,</hi> in which that magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prince was overthrown and taken Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſtands in a moſt rich, pleaſant, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Country; for on the North, and South-eaſt, the noble Plain call'd <hi>Lincoln Heath,</hi> extends itſelf, like the Plain about <hi>Salisbury,</hi> for above 50 Miles; <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Sleeford</hi> and <hi>Ancaſter</hi> South, to the Bank of the <hi>Humber</hi> North, tho' not with a Breadth equal to the Length; for the Plain is hardly any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where above Three or Four Miles broad.</p>
            <p>On the Weſt Side of this Plain, the <hi>Trent</hi> Waters make a pleaſant and rich Valley, running from <hi>New-ark</hi> to <hi>Gainſburgh,</hi> thence to <hi>Burton,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Humber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gainſburgh</hi> hath a large and fine Market, and is very flouriſhing for Trade and Buſineſs, which hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0141100403:10"/>
increaſed of late Years to the Detriment of <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Body of the Pariſh-church of this Place had been under a general Decay, and the Walls, Arches, and Pillars, ſo ſhaken and declin'd from their proper Poſition, that it was judged incapable of Repair. An Act of Parliament therefore paſſed in 1735, for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down and rebuilding it. It is famous for the <hi>Danes</hi> having landed here, when they came up the <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paſſing the <hi>Trent</hi> by a Ferry, you land in the Iſle of <hi>Axholm,</hi> which is environ'd by the <hi>Trent</hi> and the <hi>Dun. Littleborough</hi> is the <hi>Agelocum</hi> or <hi>Segelocum</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a ſmall Village Three Miles above <hi>Gainſburgh,</hi> juſt upon the Edge of the Water, and in a Nook. It ſeems only to have been environ'd with a Ditch, and was of a ſquare Form. The Water ran quite round it; for to the Weſt, where <hi>White's-bridge</hi> is, a watry Valley hems it in; ſo that it was ſufficiently ſtrong. The Church ſtands upon the higheſt Ground. The <hi>Trent</hi> has waſh'd away Part of the Eaſtern Side of the Town. Foundations and Pavements are viſible in the Bank. Here, an Urn, with the Coin of <hi>Domitian,</hi> was found; and great Numbers of Coins have been taken up in ploughing and digging, which they call <hi>Swine-pennies,</hi> becauſe thoſe Creatures ſometimes rout them up, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants take little Care to preſerve them. Mr. <hi>Ella,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Rampton</hi> hard by, has collected ſeveral, and ſome valuable.</p>
            <p>In 1718. Two Altars, handſomely moulded, of coarſe Grit-ſtone, were dug up, which are ſet as Piers in a Wall on the Side of the Steps, which lead from the River to the Inn. Many very ſmall Coins, like flatted Peas, call'd <hi>Mites,</hi> are alſo found. Mr. <hi>Hardy</hi> has a large Urn, with a Female Face on the Outſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0141100403:11"/>In this Field, near <hi>White's-bridge,</hi> are great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Buildings. Coins are often found at the loweſt Edge of the Water, when the Tide is gone off, and in dry Seaſons. On the Eaſt Side of the River has been a Camp.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Tilbridge-lane,</hi> upon the Top of the Heath, is a Spring, which, according to the vulgar Report, flows and ebbs with the <hi>Trent,</hi> tho' at Five Miles Diſtance. The like is ſaid of ſeveral others here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
            <p>Ten Miles from <hi>Lincoln</hi> Northward is <hi>Spittle,</hi> all the Way to which Place are Milliary Stones. 'Tis very pleaſant Riding, being wholly Champaign or Heath. Of theſe Stones, I believe, ſome are <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> others later Croſſes to ſupply their Place. This was, no doubt, a Manſion, becauſe hard by a little Beck runs thro' it. Here is an Hoſpital, ſaid to be founded in the Year 1308. There are great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations all around, ſome of which perhaps are <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> At preſent the Village conſiſts of Two Farm-houſes, a Chapel, an Inn, and a Seſſions-houſe. Upon the latter, is this Inſcription:

            <p>To the Left is <hi>Normanby,</hi> where the laſt but one Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> was born, and whence he aſſum'd his Title of Marquis.</p>
            <p>Half a Mile Eaſt of the preſent <hi>Wintringham,</hi> ſtood the old <hi>Roman</hi> Town, now a Common, bounded by the Marſhes upon the <hi>Humber.</hi> The City was plough'd up of late Years, and many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0141100403:12"/>The preſent <hi>Wintringham</hi> is a dirty poor Place, but ſtill a Corporation, and the Mayor is choſen only out of one Street next the old Town, where was a Chapel. The Bell of it now hangs in a wooden Frame by the Pillory. Here is a vaſt Jawbone or Rib of a Whale, which has remain'd Time out of Mind.</p>
            <p>As the Middle of the Country is all hilly, and the Weſt Side low, ſo the Eaſt Side is the richeſt, moſt fruitful, and beſt cultivated, of any County in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſo far from <hi>London.</hi> One Part is all Fen or Marſh Grounds, and extends itſelf South to the Iſle of <hi>Ely.</hi> And here it is that ſo vaſt a Quantity of Sheep are fed, as makes this County and that of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> an inexhauſtible Fountain of Wool for all the manufacturing Counties in <hi>England,</hi> as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>There are ſome good Towns on the Sea-coaſt, but I include not <hi>Barton,</hi> which ſtands on the <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as one of them, being a ſtraggling mean Town, noted for nothing but an ill-favoured dangerous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or Ferry, over the <hi>Humber</hi> to <hi>Hull</hi>; where, in an open Boat, in which we had about 15 Horſes, and 10 or 12 Cows, mingled with about 17 or 18 Paſſengers, we were about 4 Hours toſs'd about on the <hi>Humber,</hi> before we could get into the Harbour at <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well may the <hi>Humber</hi> take its Name from the Noiſe it makes; for in a high Wind it is incredibly great and terrible, like the Craſh and Daſhing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ships.</p>
            <p>Paſſing over <hi>Whitton</hi> Brook, a <hi>Roman</hi> Road goes directly to <hi>Aukborough,</hi> by that People call'd <hi>Aquis.</hi> Their Camp is now call'd <hi>Counteſs-cloſe,</hi> from a Counteſs of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who, they ſay, liv'd there, at leaſt own'd the Eſtate. The <hi>Roman</hi> Caſtle is ſquare, 300 Feet each Side, very conveniently plac'd in the North-weſt Angle of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> as a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0141100403:13"/>
over all <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> and <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> The Church is of good Stone, and has a ſquare Tower; but the Choir is ruinous, and ſeparated from the reſt of the Church by a wooden Partition. Here are numerous Reliques of the Deluge, as Sea-ſhells, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a ſquare Plot, call'd <hi>The Green,</hi> is a round Labyrinth nam'd <hi>Julian's Bower,</hi> probably from the warlike Games in Uſe among the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Youth, call'd <hi>Ludi Trojani,</hi> and ſaid by <hi>Virgil</hi> to be firſt introduc'd into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Iulus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> And the Boys, to this Day, divert themſelves with running in it one after another, and eluding their Play-fellows by their intricate Mazes. It ſeems that our Tournaments, ſo much in Faſhion till Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, are Remainders of theſe antient Diverſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burton</hi> makes a pretty Proſpect, has ſeveral Mills, and the Houſes are pleaſantly intermix'd with Trees. There are alſo Two Churches, one of which is ſo low in reſpect of the Precipice under which it ſtands, that a Perſon may almoſt leap from thence upon the Steeple.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Barrow</hi> is a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Temple, vulgarly call'd a Caſtle.</p>
            <p>A little Eaſtward hence is <hi>Thornton</hi> College, a great Abbey founded by <hi>William le Gros,</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> in the Year 1139. The Gatehouſe is very perfect, being a vaſt Tower or Caſtle of great Strength both for Offence and Defence. Before it is a large Ditch, acroſs which is laid a Bridge with Walls on each Hand, and Arches which ſupport a broad Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement to keep off the Enemy. Before it are Two round Towers. There was a Portcullis at the great Gate, and behind it another Gate of Oak. Over the Gate are Three old clumſy Statues in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Niches; a Woman ſeeming a Queen, or the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; to the Right a Man with a Lamb,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0141100403:14"/>
probably St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt; and to the Left a Biſhop, or Abbat, with a Croſier. Upon taking down an old Wall, they found a Man with a Candleſtick, Table, and Book, who was ſuppoſed to have been immur'd. The whole Monaſtery was encompaſſed by a deep Ditch, and high Rampart, to ſecure the Religious from Robbers becauſe near the Sea.</p>
            <p>A Mile Eaſt of <hi>Thornton</hi> are the Ruins of another great Caſtle call'd <hi>Kelingholme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Goſwel</hi> Pariſh Northward, is <hi>Burham,</hi> once a Chapel, which belong'd to the Monaſtery, now a Farm-houſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Pariſh near the <hi>Humber</hi> is <hi>Vere-court,</hi> which belong'd to the antient Family of that Name.</p>
            <p>The Land hereabout is good and well-wooded, and many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins are found.</p>
            <p>Two Miles Weſt of <hi>Thornton</hi> are the Ruins of a great <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, call'd <hi>Yarborough,</hi> which ſurveys the whole Hundred denominated from it. Mr. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of <hi>Kenington,</hi> which is hard by, has Pecks of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins found here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grimſby</hi> lies alſo on the <hi>Humber,</hi> but lower down towards the Ocean. It is a Mayor-town and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But its Harbour is not very ſafe for Ships to ride in, as appeared at the Time of the great Storm in 1703. when all the Ships in that Road were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from their Anchors, and moſt of them loſt. Here is a very large ſumptuous Church.</p>
            <p>We took the Round of the Sea-coaſt from hence Southward, all the Way to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and paſs'd thro' <hi>Saltfleet, Burgh,</hi> and <hi>Wainfleet,</hi> beſides ſeveral Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages lying on the Sea-ſide. The Two firſt are but inconſiderable Market-towns, but <hi>Wainfleet</hi> is a well-compacted Town and neat, tho' ſituated in the Fens. 'Tis noted for a fine Free-ſchool, and giving an Addition to the Name of the Founder of it, who was call'd <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wainfleet,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and who founded alſo <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> College.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0141100403:15"/>The River <hi>Witham</hi> croſſes the County from <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> to <hi>Boſton,</hi> where it diſembogues: at the Source of it is a little River of the ſame Name.</p>
            <p>Between this River and the Sea-coaſt North-eaſt, the ſeveral inland Towns of <hi>Bolinbroke,</hi> famous for giving Birth and Title to King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. alſo Title to Mr. Secretary <hi>St. John,</hi> one of the greateſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's of the Age, tho' unhappy in ſome of his Politics; <hi>Spilſby, Horncaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Tatterſal,</hi> on the South. About the Middle of this Diviſion made by the <hi>Witham,</hi> lie <hi>Stanton, Market-raſen, Louth,</hi> and <hi>Binbroke</hi>; and higher up Northward, ſtand <hi>Kirton, Glandſord, Brigs</hi> and <hi>Caſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spilſby</hi> is a pretty good Town, and has a well-frequented Market.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horncaſtle</hi> is almoſt ſurrounded with Water, and is a large well-built Town. But the reſt are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable except <hi>Louth</hi> and <hi>Caſter</hi>; the firſt has Two weekly conſiderable Markets, and is famous for a fine Spire Steeple, as high as that of <hi>Grantham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſter</hi> is the ancient <hi>Durobrivis,</hi> tho' <hi>Dornford</hi> retains ſomewhat of the old Name, where the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-ſtreet</hi> croſs'd the River by a Bridge of Braſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vulgar. At <hi>Cheſterton</hi> is a large Tract of Ground, call'd <hi>The Caſtle-field,</hi> with a Ditch and Rampart around it. The <hi>Roman</hi> Road runs directly thro' it, and ſtill retains its high Ridge. Beyond the River it extends for ſome Space upon the Meadow along the Bank; then forms an Angle, and proceeds full North. <hi>Caſter</hi> is above half a Mile from it, upon the Hill. A Part of the Foundation of the Wall of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Camp is viſible in the Street to the North-weſt Corner of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wall of the Houſe, where the Miniſter lives. It may be known by the great Strength of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, built of the white Slab-ſtone of the Country. Underneath this lay the City; for below the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0141100403:16"/>

            <p>In the <hi>Boot</hi> Alehouſe Cellar is a Piece of a Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as are many at Mr. <hi>Wright</hi>'s, and in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den an intire one; beſides great Numbers of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, in the Poſſeſſion of Monſ. <hi>Baillardeau.</hi> In the plough'd Fields between the Town and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, toward <hi>Fordgreen,</hi> is a Tract which runs quite thro', whereon Corn grows very ſcantily. This is nothing but a Road laid with a deep Bed of Gravel, tho' the ſuperſtitious Country-people believe it was curſed by the Lady <hi>Kyneburg,</hi> the Abbeſs who built a religious Houſe, which ſtood Eaſtward of the Church, and ſome Part of which ſtill remains. This Meadow is call'd <hi>Norman-gate</hi> (or more properly, <hi>Dorman-gate</hi>) Field, from the Town, whoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are found all about this Place; and alſo innumerable Coins, call'd <hi>Dorman-pence.</hi> Part of this is <hi>Berryſtead,</hi> where Antiquities are daily dug up. <hi>Mill-field</hi> ſtands higher toward <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> where Moſaic Pavements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are found, and ſeems to have been a little Citadel belonging to the Town.</p>
            <p>Part of the Church is an antique Building, but new-modell'd. Upon a Stone over the Choir-door is a curious Inſcription, importing that the Church was conſecrated on the 17th of <hi>April</hi> 1114. The Steeple ſtands in the Middle of the Church. The Tower is a fine Piece of antient Architecture with ſemicircular Arches. The ſquare Well by the Porch is <hi>Roman,</hi> ſurrounded with hewn Stone; and tho' it ſtands on a Hill, the Water is very high. At the Eaſt-end of the Church is a very old Croſs.</p>
            <p>A little higher up the River, near <hi>Wansford</hi> Bridge, a Gold <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coin was found, which is in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Maurice Johnſon,</hi> an eminent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor.</p>

            <p>This Part is indeed very properly called <hi>Holland</hi>; for 'tis a flat, level, and often drowned Country, like the Province of the ſame Name in the <hi>Low Countries</hi>; inſomuch that the very Ditches are navigable, and the People paſs from Town to Town in Boats, as they do there. Here we had the uncouth Muſick of the <hi>Bittern,</hi> a Bird formerly counted ominous and preſaging, and which, as ſome ſay, thruſts its Bill into a Reed, and others into a Bog, and then gives the dull, heavy Groan or Sound, like a Sigh; which is ſo loud, that 'tis heard Two or Three Miles Diſtance as ſome People ſay.</p>
            <p>Here we firſt ſaw <hi>Boſton,</hi> and making towards it, found it a Sea-port Town, at the Mouth of the <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</hi>

            <p>The Tower is the higheſt and nobleſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> being 100 Yards, and is ſeen plainly 40 Miles round this level Country, and farther by Sea. The Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon Lantern on the Top is very beautiful, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable for the Thinneſs of the Stone-work. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners find it particularly uſeful to guide them into this Port, and even into the Mouth of the River <hi>Ouſe</hi>; for in clear Weather 'tis ſeen quite out at Sea to the Entrance of thoſe Chanels, which they call <hi>Lynn Deeps,</hi> and <hi>Boſton Deeps,</hi> which are as difficult Places as moſt upon the Eaſtern Shore of <hi>Britain.</hi> This is particularly taken Notice of in an Act paſſed in the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Anne, for enabling Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be made for Repairing and keeping in Repair this Church:</hi> in the Preamble to which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as it deſerves, as an antient, well-built Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick; that the Tower thereof is very high, and an uſeful Sea-mark; and that it being ſituate near the Haven, a great Sum is neceſſary yearly to be raiſed,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0141100403:18"/>
to preſerve it from a violent, conſtantly ebbing and flowing Water.</p>
            <p>There was a prodigious Clock-Bell which could be heard Six or Seven Miles round; it had many old Verſes round it, but <hi>Anno</hi> 1710. was knocked in Pieces, and the Inſcription not taken.</p>
            <p>Twenty Yards from the Foundation of this Tower runs the rapid <hi>Witham,</hi> thro' a wooden Bridge.</p>
            <p>This Town abounded with religious Houſes, whoſe Lands King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. gave to the Town.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> I. was a great Benefactreſs likewiſe to it, and gave them Lands called <hi>Erection</hi> Lands, to pay a Vicar, Lecturer, and Two Schoolmaſters.</p>
            <p>The Church is reckon'd the largeſt Pariſh-church without croſs Ayles, in the Univerſe; 'tis 100 Feet wide, and 300 long within the Walls. The Roof is handſomely ceiled with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oak, ſupported by 24 tall and ſlender Pillars.</p>
            <p>Formerly the Town laboured under the Want of freſh Water, which was a great Diſcouragement to Merchants and others ſettling there. To remedy which Inconvenience, <hi>John Smyth</hi> of <hi>Heath,</hi> in the County of <hi>York,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> procur'd an Act of Parliament which paſſed in the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> to incloſe Two Acres of the great Common, called <hi>The Weſt Fen,</hi> for a Pond or Ciſtern, and to erect a Water-houſe and Mill upon the ſaid Common, and other proper Edifices, and to lay Pipes from the Pond for ſupplying the Town.</p>
            <p>The Town is large, populous, and well-built, full of Merchants, and has a good Share of foreign Trade, as well as <hi>Lynn.</hi> 'Tis built on both Sides of the River <hi>Witham.</hi> It is a Corporation, governed by a Mayor, and 12 Aldermen. It has two Markets weekly, and a commodious Haven. Here is held one of thoſe annual Fairs, which preſerve the antient Title of a <hi>Mart,</hi> whereof I remember only Four in <hi>England</hi> of any conſiderable Note, <hi>viz. Lynn, Gainſburgh,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0141100403:19"/>
               <hi>Beverly,</hi> and <hi>Boſton.</hi> Its Trade of late Years has not increaſed.</p>
            <p>Eaſt of <hi>Boſton</hi> was a Chapel called <hi>Hiptoft,</hi> and in the Town a Church dedicated to St. <hi>John,</hi> but both demoliſh'd. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave the Corporation a Court of Admiralty over all the Sea-coaſts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
            <p>The Country round this Place is all <hi>Fen</hi> and Marſh Grounds, the Land is very rich, and feeds prodigious Numbers of large Sheep, and alſo Oxen of the largeſt Size, the beſt of which are driven to <hi>London</hi> Market; and from this Part, as alſo from the Downs or Heath above-mentioned, comes, as I have before noted, a great Part of the Wool, known, as a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable Diſtinction, becauſe of its Fineneſs, by the Name of <hi>Lincolnſhire Wool</hi>; which is ſent in great Quantities into <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> for the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers of thoſe Countries, and indeed to ſeveral other of the trading Counties in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Fens are very conſiderable for their Extent; for they reach in Length, in ſome Places, 50 Miles, and in Breadth above 30: and as they are ſo level, that there is no Interruption to the Sight, any Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of extraordinary Height is ſeen a long Way. For Example, <hi>Boſton</hi> Steeple is ſeen upon <hi>Lincoln</hi> Heath, near 30 Miles; <hi>Peterborough</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſeen almoſt thoughout the whole Level; ſo are the Spires of <hi>Lynn, Whittleſea,</hi> and <hi>Crowland,</hi> ſeen at a very great Diſtance, which adds ſome Beauty to the Country.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Boſton</hi> we came on thro' the <hi>Fen</hi> Country to <hi>Holbech,</hi> a little Market-town, and ſo on to <hi>Spald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is another Sea-port in the Level, but ſtanding far within the Land on the River <hi>Welland,</hi> which almoſt incloſes it. Here was nothing very remarkable to be ſeen as to Antiquity, but the Ruins of an old Monaſtery, of which the <hi>Monaſticon</hi> gives a particular Deſcription. There is a Bridge
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0141100403:20"/>
over the <hi>Welland,</hi> and Veſſels of about 50 or 60 Tons may come up to the Town; and that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Trade of <hi>Spalding,</hi> which is chiefly in Corn and Coal.</p>
            <p>We muſt not paſs by <hi>Crowland,</hi> another Place of great religious Antiquity, here being once a famous Monaſtery, the Remains of which are ſtill to be ſeen. The Monks of <hi>Crowland</hi> were eminent in Hiſtory, and a great many Stories are told of the Devils of <hi>Crowland</hi> alſo, and what Converſation they had with the Monks, which Tales are more out of Date now, than they were formerly.</p>
            <p>The Abbey was founded 1000 Years ago by <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> in the midſt of Bogs and Thorns, in Honour of his Chaplain <hi>Guthlac,</hi> who choſe this Place to mortify in. The Foundation is laid on Piles of Wood, ſeveral of which have been found in tearing up the Ruins of the Eaſtern Part of the Church; for what remains is only Part of the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, and of that only one Corner in tolerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, which is at preſent their Pariſh-church. In the Middle of the Croſs ſtood once a lofty Tower, and in it was a remarkably fine Ring of Bells; the firſt, as is ſaid in the County. The Roof, which was of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oak finely carv'd and gilt, fell down about 40 Years ago, and Pieces of it are to be found in almoſt every Houſe. People at Pleaſure dig up the monumental Stones for private Uſe, and what are left in the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are cover'd over with Shrubs. It was made a Gariſon in the late Civil Wars, and the Soldiers deſtroy'd the painted Glaſs in it. All the Eaſtern Part of the Body of the Church is intirely raz'd to the Foundation. The monaſtick Buildings, Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Hall, Abbat's Lodgings, are abſolutely demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd. In the North-weſt Corner of the Church ſtands a ſtrong Tower, with a very obtuſe Spire, and a pleaſant Ring of ſmall Bells. Over the Weſt Gate are the Images of divers Kings, Abbats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0141100403:21"/>
among the reſt, <hi>Guthlac</hi> with a Whip and Knife, his uſual Symbols.</p>
            <p>Not far from the Abbey, is the Remnant of a little Stone Cottage, called <hi>Anchor-church-houſe,</hi> where was a Chapel, in which St. <hi>Guthlac</hi> was bury'd, and where he lived a Hermit.</p>
            <p>Over-againſt the Weſt-end of the Abbey, is the famous triangular Bridge, hardly to be equalled in <hi>Britain,</hi> if in <hi>Europe.</hi> It being too ſteep for Horſes and Carriages to go over, they paſs under it. 'Tis formed on Three Segments of a Circle meeting in one Point; and each Baſe, they ſay, ſtands in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent County. Here meet the Rivers <hi>Nyne</hi> and <hi>Welland.</hi> So that the Bridge, being fixed at the very Point where they join, ſtands upon a Centre in the Middle of the united Waters; and then parting into Two Bridges, lands you one to the Right on <hi>Thorney,</hi> and one to the Left upon <hi>Holland.</hi> On one Side fits an Image of King <hi>Athelbald,</hi> Founder of <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Abbey,</hi> with a Globe in his Hand.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Spalding</hi> is not large, but pretty well built and well inhabited, and is a handſome and large Market-town; but for the Healthineſs or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of it, I have no more to ſay, than that I was very glad when I got out of it, as well as out of the reſt of the Fen Country; for 'tis a horrid Air for a Stranger to breathe in.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the Draining theſe Fens, by a Set of Gentlemen, called the <hi>Adventurers</hi>; the ſeveral Laws for ſecuring and preſerving the Banks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Lands; how they were by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conflux of Waters from all the Inland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England</hi> frequently overflowed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lay under Water moſt Part of the Year; how all the Waters in this Part of <hi>England,</hi> which do not run into the <hi>Thames,</hi> the <hi>Trent,</hi> or the <hi>Severn,</hi> fall together into theſe low Grounds, and empty themſelves into the Sea by thoſe Drains, as thro' a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0141100403:22"/>
Sink; and how by the Skill of theſe Adventurers, and at a prodigious Expence, they have cut new Chanels, and even whole Rivers, with particular Drains from one River to another, to carry off the great Flux of Waters, when Floods or Freſhes come down either on one Side or on the other; and how, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that Hands could do, or Art contrive, yet ſometimes the Waters do ſtill prevail, the Banks break, and whole Levels are overflowed together; All this, and much more that might be ſaid on ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious a Subject, tho' it would be very uſeful to have it fully and geographically deſcrib'd, yet it would take up ſo much Room, that I cannot think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering any farther into it, than juſt to mention, That an Act of Parliament lately paſſed to enable the Adventurers, Owners, and Proprietors of the taxable Lands, and the Owners and Proprietors of the free Lands in <hi>Deeping Fen, Pinchbeck,</hi> and <hi>Spalding South Fen, Therlby Fen, Bourn South Fen,</hi> and <hi>Croyland Fen,</hi> &amp;c. in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> containing in the Whole about 30,000 Acres, to raiſe a competent Sum for the effectual Draining and future Preſervation of all the ſaid Fens, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Agreement in that behalf, dated <hi>Febr.</hi> 23.1737, and to carry the ſaid Agreement into Execution.</p>
            <p>We ſhall only obſerve further, that Sir <hi>John Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote,</hi> Bart. hath made ſo good a Progreſs in draining 366 Acres of the <hi>Therlby Fen</hi> Paſtures, belonging to him, that he is particularly exempted from paying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sums levied upon others by this Act.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fens of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> are of the ſame Kind with, and contiguous to, thoſe already mentioned in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon</hi>; and here, as well as there, we ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Numbers of Cattle, which are fed up to an extraordinary Size by the Richneſs of the Soil.</p>
            <p>Here are alſo an infinite Number of Wild-Fowl, ſuch as Duck and Mallard, Teal and Wigeon, Brand-Geeſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0141100403:23"/>
Wild-Geeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the taking of the four firſt Kinds, here are a great many <hi>Decoys,</hi> from all which the vaſt Number of Fowls they take, are ſent up to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Accounts which the Country People give of the Numbers they ſometimes take, are ſuch, that one ſcarce dares report it from them. But this I can ſay, of my certain Knowlege, that ſome of theſe Decoys are of ſo great an Extent, and take ſuch great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Fowl, that they are let from 100<hi>l.</hi> to 3, 4, and 500<hi>l.</hi> a Year Rent.</p>
            <p>The Art of taking the Fowls, and eſpeciaally of Breeding up a Set of Creatures, called <hi>Decoy-Ducks,</hi> to intice and then betray their Fellow-Ducks into the ſeveral Decoys, is very ingenious; and tho' 'tis not very eaſy to deſcribe it, I will give it in as few Words as I can.</p>
            <p>The Decoy-Ducks are hatched and bred up in the Decoy Ponds; in which are certain Places where they are conſtantly fed, and being made tame, they are uſed to come to the Decoy-Man's Hand for their Food.</p>
            <p>When they fly abroad, it is not known whither they go, but ſome conjecture they fly quite over into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; where they meet with others of their own Kind, and ſorting with them, they, by ſome Art, unknown to us, draw together a vaſt Number of the Fowls, and, in a Word, <hi>kidnap</hi> them from their own Country; for being once brought out of their Knowlege, they follow the Decoys, as a Dog follows the Sportſman; and 'tis frequent to ſee theſe ſubtle Creatures return with a vaſt Flight of Fowls along with them, after they have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeveral Weeks together.</p>
            <p>When they have brought them over, the firſt Thing they do is to ſettle with them in the Ponds, to which the Decoy-Ducks belong. Here they chatter and gabble to them in their own Language,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0141100403:24"/>
as if they were telling them, that here they ſhould ſoon ſee how well they ſhould live.</p>
            <p>When the Decoy-Men perceive they are come, and that they are gathering and increaſing, they go ſecretly to the Pond's Side, under the Cover which they have made with Reeds, ſo that they cannot be ſeen, where they throw over the Reeds Handfuls of Corn, in ſuch ſhallow Places, as the Decoy-Ducks are uſually fed, and whither they are ſure to come for it, and to bring their new Gueſts with them for their Entertainment.</p>
            <p>This they do for two or three Days together, and no Harm follows to the poor Strangers, till throwing in this Bait one time in an open wide Place, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time in another wide Place, the third time it is thrown in a narrower Place; where the Trees, which hang over the Water and the Banks, ſtand cloſer together; and then in another yet narrower, where the ſaid Trees are over-head like an Arbour, tho' at a good Height from the Water.</p>
            <p>Here the Boughs are ſo artfully managed, that a large Net is ſpread near the Tops of the Trees among the Branches, and faſtened to Hoops which reach from Side to Side. This is ſo high, and ſo wide, and the Room is ſo much below, and the Water ſo open, that the Fowls do not perceive the Net above them.</p>
            <p>Here the Decoy-Man keeping unſeen, behind the Hedges of Reeds, which are made perfectly cloſe, goes forward, throwing Corn over the Reeds into the Water. The Decoy-Ducks greedily fall upon it, and, calling their foreign Gueſts, ſeem to tell them, that now they may find, how well the Ducks live in <hi>England</hi>; ſo inviting, or rather wheedling them forward, 'till by degrees they are all gotten under the Arch or Sweep of the Net, which is on the Trees, and which by degrees, imperceptibly to them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines lower and lower, and alſo narrower and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0141100403:25"/>
till at the farther End it comes to a Point like a Purſe; though this farther End is quite out of Sight, and perhaps two or three hundred Yards from the firſt Entrance.</p>
            <p>When the whole Flight of Ducks are thus gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily following the Decoys, and feeding plentifully as they go; and the Decoy-Man ſees they are all ſo far within the Arch of the Net, as not to be able to eſcape, on a ſudden a Dog, which till then keeps cloſe by him, and which is perfectly taught his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ruſhes from behind the Reeds, and jumps into the Water, ſwimming directly after the Ducks, and barks as he ſwims.</p>
            <p>Immediately the frighted Ducks riſe upon the Wing to make their Eſcape; but are beaten down again by the arched Net, which is over their Heads. Being then forced into the Water, they neceſſarily ſwim forward, for fear of the Dog; and thus they croud on, 'till by Degrees the Net growing lower and narrower, they are hurried to the very farther End, where another Decoy-Man ſtands ready to receive them, and who takes them out alive with his Hands.</p>
            <p>As for the Traitors, that drew the poor Ducks into this Snare, they are taught to riſe but a little Way, and ſo not reaching to the Net, they fly back to the Ponds, and make their Eſcape; or elſe, being uſed to the Decoy-Man, they go to him fearleſs, and are taken out as the reſt; but inſtead of being killed with them, are ſtrok'd, made much of, and put into a little Pond juſt by him, and plentifully fed for their Services.</p>
            <p>There are many Particulars in the managing and draining theſe Levels, throwing off the Water by Mills and Engines, and cultivating the Grounds in an unuſual manner, which would be very uſeful to be deſcribed; but the needful Brevity of this Work, will not admit of it: yet ſomething of it may be touched upon.<list>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0141100403:26"/>
                  <item>1. That here are ſome wonderful Engines for throwing up Water, and ſuch as are not to be ſeen any-where elſe; whereof one in particular threw up (as they aſſured us) 1200 Tons of Water in half an Hour, and goes by Wind-Sails, 12 Wings or Sails to a Mill.</item>
                  <item>2. Here are the greateſt Improvements by Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hemp, that, I think, are to be ſeen in <hi>England</hi>; particularly on the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Sides of the <hi>Fens,</hi> as about <hi>Wiſbech, Wells,</hi> and ſeveral other Places, where we ſaw many hundred Acres of Ground bearing great Crops of Hemp.</item>
                  <item>3. Here is a particular Trade carried on with <hi>London,</hi> which is no-where elſe practiſed in the whole Kingdom, that I have met with, or heard of, <hi>viz.</hi> For carrying Fiſh alive by Land-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; this they do by carrying great Buts filled with Water in Waggons, as the Carriers draw other Goods. The Buts have a little ſquare Flap, inſtead of a Bung, about 10, 12, or 14 Inches ſquare, which, being opened, gives Air to the Fiſh: and every Night, when they come to the Inn, they draw off the Water, and let more freſh and ſweet Water run into them again. In theſe Carriages they chiefly carry Tench and Pike, Pearch and Eels, but eſpecially the two former, of which here are ſome of the largeſt in <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>Whittleſea</hi> and <hi>Ramſey</hi> Meres are Two Lakes, made by the River <hi>Nyne,</hi> which runs through them; the firſt is between Five and Six Miles long, and Three Miles broad, and is indeed full of excellent Fiſh for this Trade.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hermen-ſtreet</hi> goes in a ſtrait Line thro' great and little <hi>Stukely,</hi> antiently written <hi>Styvecle,</hi> which Name it acquir'd from its <hi>ſtiff clay</hi> Soil. In <hi>Great Stukely</hi> Church is a Font of a very antique Make.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0141100403:27"/>
The <hi>Hermen-ſtreet,</hi> after this, becomes notorious by the Name of <hi>Stangate.</hi> Near <hi>Stilton</hi> ſome Parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtill pav'd with Stone, which ſtrengthens the Conjecture, that the Name <hi>Stangate</hi> was given it from thence. It traverſes great Woods between the Two <hi>Saltries,</hi> where was a religious Foundation of <hi>Simon Silvanect,</hi> the ſecond Earl of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi>; among the Ruins of which lie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Robert Brus,</hi> Lord of <hi>Anandale</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Cleveland</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, from whom the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Branch of our Royal Family is deſcended. Near the Road Side <hi>Roman</hi> Urns have been dug up.</p>
            <p>Half a Mile out of the Road is the Seat of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> the learned Friend of the great <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> where he had a choice Collection of <hi>Roman</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions from all Parts of the Kingdom. The Houſe was built in a magnificent manner of hewn Stone; but now lies in diſmal Ruins. By it is a moſt beautiful Church, with a Tower; and in the Windows is fine painted Glaſs. From thoſe Woods above-mention'd, your Eye commands the whole Level of the Fens, particularly <hi>Whitleſey-mere,</hi> where the Gentry have little Veſſels to ſail in for Pleaſure. Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> digging the Foundation of a Houſe on the Hill whence you enjoy this Proſpect, found the Skeleton of a Fiſh, 12 Feet long.</p>
            <p>A little to the Right lies <hi>Ramſey,</hi> famed for a rich Abbey; little of which is now left, but a Part of the old Gate-houſe. In the Yard I ſaw a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected Statue of the Founder <hi>Alwyn,</hi> who was called <hi>Alderman of all</hi> England, and was Couſin to King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and Son of Duke <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Half-King.</hi> This is one of the moſt antient Pieces of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sculpture which we know of. The Keys and ragged Staff in his Hand denote his Office. The Abbey was dedicated to St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and was a rich Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0141100403:28"/>
and at the Diſſolution valued at 1716<hi>l. per Annum.</hi> for the Maintenance of 60 Monks. In the Year 1721. a great Quantity of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins were found at <hi>Ramſey</hi>; which were believed to be hid there by the Monks upon ſome Inroad of the <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At every Mile from <hi>Grantham</hi> to <hi>Stangate</hi> are Stones ſet up by Mr. <hi>Boulter,</hi> which he deſign'd to have carry'd on to <hi>London,</hi> for the general Benefit.</p>
            <p>All the Country between <hi>Huntingdon</hi> River and <hi>Peterborough</hi> River, is Clay, Sand, and Gravel; but beyond that, to the <hi>Humber,</hi> Stone.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Gunworth</hi> Ferry over <hi>Peterborough</hi> River is a Bridge, a few Years ago erected, where Boats pay Toll. The People of <hi>Peterborough</hi> were a good while averſe to having their River made navigable, out of an abſurd Notion, that it would ſpoil their Trade. But they begin to be better inform'd, or, as I may ſay, to have more Wit, on the Progreſs made in that Navigation, which I ſhall mention more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by-and-by, when I come to <hi>Oundle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Fens,</hi> longing to be delivered from Fogs, and ſtagnate Air, and Water of the Colour of brewed Ale, like the Rivers of the <hi>Peak,</hi> we firſt ſet Foot on dry Land, <hi>as I called it,</hi> at <hi>Peterborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we enter it, we muſt not omit to take ſome Notice of <hi>Foderinghay</hi> Caſtle, ſituate on a Branch of the <hi>Nyne,</hi> famous for the Impriſonment and Decollation of the unfortunate <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> It ſeems to have been very ſtrong, and it had a high Mount or Keep, inviron'd with a deep Ditch. 'Tis moſtly demoliſh'd, and all the Materials carry'd off; ſome ſay it was deſtroy'd by Order of King <hi>James</hi> I. in Revenge of his Mother's Sufferings. They pretended to ſhew me here the Ruins of the Hall, where that Princeſs was beheaded. It was the Seat of <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> whoſe Body was bury'd in the Collegiate Church here; a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0141100403:29"/>
very neat Building founded by <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> likewiſe interred here. The Chancel in which they were bury'd, was intirely demoliſhed at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; but theſe Monuments were reſtored by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Church Windows are filled with handſome painted Glaſs, ſav'd by a Sum of Money to the Soldiery in the late Civil War, and repreſent St. <hi>Denys,</hi> St. <hi>Guthlac,</hi> Abp. <hi>Scrope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Peterborough</hi> ſtands in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> and is a little City of great Antiquity ſeated on the River <hi>Nyne,</hi> and indeed 'tis the leaſt in <hi>England</hi>; for <hi>Bath,</hi> or <hi>Wells,</hi> or <hi>Ely,</hi> or <hi>Carliſle,</hi> are all much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; yet <hi>Peterborough</hi> is no contemptible Place nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here are ſome good Houſes, a handſome Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and the Streets are fair and well-built; but the Glory of <hi>Peterborough</hi> is the Cathedral, which is truly fine and beautiful, and the nobleſt Piece of <hi>Gothick</hi> Building in <hi>England</hi>; but it appears to be more modern, than the Story of raiſing this Pile implies, which was near 1050 Years ago. It wants only, to make it complete, a fine Tower Steeple, and Spire on the Top of it. A Mayor, Aldermen, and Recorder, are the chief Magiſtrates here.</p>
            <p>In this Church was buried the Body of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> above-mentioned, but it was afterwards removed by King <hi>James</hi> I. her Son, into <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> where a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is erected for her, in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIIth's Chapel; tho' ſome do not ſtick to tell us, that tho' the Monument was erected, the Body was never remov'd.</p>
            <p>Here alſo lies interred <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> another unhappy Queen, and the divorc'd Wife of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and Mother to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> I. Her Monument is not very magnificent, but 'tis far from mean. Here is an old decayed Monument of Biſhop <hi>Wulfer,</hi> the Founder of the Church; but this Church has ſo often been burnt and demoliſhed ſince tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Time, that 'tis doubtful, whether the Monument be authentick or not.</p>
            <p>In the Cathedral is the Figure of one <hi>Scarlet,</hi> a Sexton, who buried the above named Two Queens, one 50 Years after the other, and under it the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Inſcription:

He died at 95 Years old.</p>
            <p>The Chapel here, called St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, is a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Building, tho' now not in Uſe. The Choir has been often repaired and beautify'd, and is now very fine; but the Weſt End, or great Gate, is a Prodigy for Beauty and Variety. 'Tis remarkable, that as this Church, when a Monaſtery, was famous for its great Revenues, ſo now, as reduced, 'tis one of the pooreſt Biſhopricks in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1720. at <hi>Thorp,</hi> the Seat of Sir <hi>Francis St. John,</hi> by <hi>Peterborough,</hi> a Moſaick Pavement was found. This was undoubtedly a <hi>Villa</hi> of ſome <hi>Roman</hi> of Diſtinction. In the Garden are ſome fine antique Marble Statues, which ſuffer more from the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than from Age. In the Middle is a <hi>Livia</hi> of a <hi>Coloſſean</hi> Proportion: in the Four Quarters, <hi>Diana, Amphion,</hi> an Orator, and a Gladiator: upon the Terrace, an admirable <hi>Hercules</hi> killing the <hi>Hydra:</hi> in the Court, Two Equeſtrian Figures in Copper, King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Over moſt of the Doors of the Houſe, are placed Buſtoes of <hi>Baſſianus, Caracalla,</hi> and others. Theſe Antiquities were of the <hi>Arundel</hi> Collection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0141100403:31"/>As great Part of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> which is a vaſtly extended County, remained yet unſeen by me, I was obliged to turn North from <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and take a View of the <hi>Fens</hi> again, tho' we kept them at ſome Diſtance too. Here we paſs'd the <hi>Welland</hi> at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Deeping,</hi> an old, ill-built and dirty Town. Then we went thro' <hi>Bourn</hi> to <hi>Folkingham,</hi> near which we ſaw two Pieces of decay'd Magnificence; one was the old demoliſh'd Monaſtery of <hi>Sempringham,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Gilbertine</hi> Nuns, famous for Auſterity; and the other was the antient Houſe of the Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Admiral, where that great and noble Perſon once lived in the utmoſt Splendor. The Houſe, tho' in its full Decay, ſhews what it has been, and the Plaiſter of the Ceilings and Walls in ſome Rooms is ſo fine, ſo firm, and ſo intire, that they break it off in large Flakes, and it will bear Writing on with a Pencil or Steel Pen, like the Leaves of a Table-book. This Sort of Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter I have not ſeen any-where ſo prodigiouſly fine, except in the Palace of <hi>Noneſuch</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> near <hi>Epſom,</hi> before it was demoliſhed by the Lord <hi>Berkley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we croſs'd Part of the great Heath mentioned before, and came into the high Road again at <hi>Ancaſter,</hi> a ſmall, but antient <hi>Roman</hi> Village, call'd <hi>Segeloci.</hi> It is full of Remnants of Antiquity; a ſufficient Teſtimony of which may be deduc'd from the Traffick which the Town's-people have for many Years carry'd on with the Sale of them. After a Shower the Schoolboys and Shepherds look for them on the Declivities, and never return empty.</p>
            <p>The Town conſiſts of one Street, running North and South along the Road. There is a Spring at both Ends of the Town, which, no doubt, was the Reaſon for the <hi>Romans</hi> pitching it at this Place; for there is no more Water from hence to <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Weſt Side of the Town is a Road, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſign'd for the Convenience of thoſe who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0141100403:32"/>
travelled when the Gates were ſhut. In the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard are two Prieſts cut in Stone.</p>
            <p>This muſt have been a populous Place, from the large Quarries about it, and the Rock lying a very little way beneath the Surface.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ancaſter</hi> we came to <hi>Grantham,</hi> famous for a very fine Church, and its Spire Steeple. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notion, that this Steeple ſtands leaning, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a vulgar Error: I had no Inſtrument indeed to judge it by, but, according to the ſtricteſt Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, I could not perceive it, or any thing like it, and am much of Opinion with that excellent Poet:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>'Tis Height makes</hi> Grantham <hi>Steeple ſtand awry.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
The chief Magiſtrate here is an Alderman, aſſiſted by Twelve Juſtices. This is a neat, pleaſant, well-built and populous Town, has a good Market, and the Inhabitants are ſaid to have a very good Trade, and to be generally rich.</p>
            <p>It was certainly a <hi>Roman</hi> Town, and Remains of a Caſtle have been formerly dug up there. The Spire Steeple is 100 Yards high, and equalled only by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in this County at <hi>Louth,</hi> beſides the Tower of <hi>Boſton.</hi> Here were many Religious Houſes: Ruins of ſome of which ſtill remain. In one juſt by the Market-place, is a very pretty little Chapel or Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory adorned with Imagery. Here is a good Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchool, erected by <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſtor</hi>; where Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> received the firſt Principles of Literature, under the famous <hi>William Walker,</hi> then Schoolmaſter. This Town lying on the great Northern Road is famous, as well as <hi>Stamford,</hi> for abundance of very good Inns, ſome of them fit to entertain Perſons of the greateſt Quality, and their Retinues, and it is a great Advantage to the Place.</p>
            <p>Within a Mile of <hi>Grantham</hi> ſtands <hi>Belton,</hi> a late-built Houſe belonging to the Family of <hi>Brownlow,</hi> Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> one of the moſt regular
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0141100403:33"/>
and beautiful Seats in this County; adorned with curious Gardens, and a large Park. But I ſhould not omit to take ſome Notice, before I quit <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Ancaſter</hi>'s pleaſant Seat at <hi>Grimſthorpe.</hi> It is a handſome and commodious Houſe: the Park is large and beautiful; the <hi>Lawn</hi> there, whereon is an annual Horſe-race, is delightful. In the Middle of the Park ſtood <hi>Vaudy Abbey,</hi> founded <hi>Anno</hi> 1147, ſome ſmall Ruins of which are ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>From a Hill, about a Mile beyond this Town North-weſt, being on the great <hi>York</hi> Road, we had a Proſpect again into the Vale of <hi>Bever,</hi> or <hi>Belvoir.</hi> which I mentioned before; and which ſpreads itſelf here into three Counties, to wit, <hi>Lincoln, Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Rutlandſhires:</hi> alſo here we had a diſtant View of <hi>Belvoir</hi> Caſtle, which, 'tis ſuppoſed, took its Name from the Situation, from whence there is ſo fine a Proſpect over the Country, that you ſee from the Hill into <hi>Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Leiceſter, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Northamptonſhires.</hi> The Caſtle or Palace (for ſuch it now is) of <hi>Belvoir</hi> is the Seat of the noble Family of <hi>Manners,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Rutland,</hi> who have alſo a very noble Eſtate, equal to the Demeſnes of ſome Sovereign Princes, extending itſelf into <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Derbyſhires</hi> far and wide, and in which Eſtate they have an immenſe ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Treaſure, never to be exhauſted; I mean the Lead-mines and Coal-pits, of which I ſhall ſay more in their Place.</p>
            <p>In the fine Gallery of this noble Seat are very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern Family and other Pictures, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Original one of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. as he ſat at his Trial.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Botteſworth,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> we viſited the Tombs of the <hi>Manners</hi> noble Family, which are worth ſeeing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0141100403:34"/>The other Towns which lie on the South-weſt of the <hi>Witham</hi> in this County, not already mentioned, are;
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Beckingham,</hi> an inconſiderable little Place lying North of <hi>Grantham.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Dunnington,</hi> a good Market-town, noted for large Quantities of Hemp and Hemp Seed.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Seaford,</hi> ſituate in a Valley on a little River, which is ſo rapid, that its Streams never freeze. It has a good Market, and a long, ſquare Market-place facing Three Streets. And alſo,</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Bourne,</hi> famous for the Inauguration of <hi>Edmund</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Turning Southward from hence we enter'd <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landſhire,</hi> remarkable for being the leaſt County in <hi>England,</hi> having but Two Market-towns in it, <hi>viz. Okeham</hi> and <hi>Uppingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Okeham</hi> ſtands in the rich Valley of <hi>Cathroſs.</hi> It has a Caſtle, in which the Aſſizes are held, an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for the Poor, and a Free-ſchool for the Education of Youth. 'Tis a Cuſtom in this Town, that when a Nobleman comes on Horſeback within its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, he is obliged to pay Homage of a Shoe from his Horſe, or to commute for it in Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uppingham</hi> is a new well-built Town, ſtanding on a Hill; and has alſo an Hoſpital and Free-ſchool.</p>
            <p>This County, tho' ſo ſmall, is famous for abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of fine Seats of the Gentlemen, and ſome of firſt Rank; as particularly the Earls of <hi>Gainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> and <hi>Winchelſea.</hi> The late Earl of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> at a very great Expence, rebuilt the antient Seat of <hi>Burleigh on the Hill,</hi> near <hi>Oakham,</hi> and on the Edge of the Vale of <hi>Cathroſs.</hi> It would take up too much of my Room to deſcribe as I ought, this noble Houſe, with its curious Paintings, fine Library, and delightful Gardens. I can only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that tho' there may be ſome ſumptuous Palaces
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0141100403:35"/>
in <hi>England</hi> (which abounds with ſo many fine ones) that excel in this or that Particular; I do not know a Houſe in <hi>Britain,</hi> which excels all the reſt in ſo many Particulars.</p>
            <p>I cannot help mentioning here, that I was drawn to make a Viſit, in my Journey, to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Edward Roberts</hi> of <hi>Glaſton,</hi> in this little County, purely for the ſake of his excellent Character; and we were received by him with great Courteſy. This Gentleman had a very ſmall Living in the County, the Income of which, with the Surplus of his Eſtate, he devoted to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous; and of late Years had provided himſelf with all Sorts of Medicines from <hi>London,</hi> ſo that his Time was ſpent in relieving the Poor in a double Capacity, as a Divine and a Phyſician. He often refuſed Promotions in the Church, tho' his Rector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was accounted the pooreſt in the County; he diſapproved Pluralities, and always look'd with Love on his Pariſh, as his Family: but this excellent Clergyman died a few Months after we were there, in <hi>March</hi> 1739-40, univerſally lamented. His Brother, <hi>Thomas Roberts,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> died about Twelve Months before him, with as good a Character for a Lawyer, as this Gentleman had for a Divine; for he would give his Advice <hi>gratis,</hi> as well as his Practice, to all without Exception; and tho' a great Friend to the preſent Royal Family, would never accept of Place or Penſion, and never would interfere in Elections, which he thought ſhould always be left free, and uninfluenced.</p>
            <p>From hence we came to <hi>St. Martins,</hi> and ſtopp'd at the <hi>George,</hi> out of Curioſity, becauſe it is reckoned one of the greateſt Inns in <hi>England,</hi> and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Stamford.</hi> This Town is placed in a kind of an Angle of the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> juſt upon the Edge of Three Counties, <hi>viz. Lincoln, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> and <hi>Rutland:</hi> this Town boaſts greatly too
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0141100403:36"/>
of its Antiquity, and indeed it has evident Marks of its having been a very great Place in former Days.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory tells us it was burnt by the <hi>Danes</hi> above 1500 Years ago, being then a flouriſhing City: it was alſo once an Univerſity, and here are ſtill the Remains of Two Colleges, one called <hi>Blackhall,</hi> and the other <hi>Brazen Noſe</hi>; on the Gate whereof is a great <hi>Brazen Noſe,</hi> and a Ring through it, like that at <hi>Oxford</hi>; nor could it take this from <hi>Oxford,</hi> but <hi>Oxford</hi> from that, which is as old as <hi>Edward</hi> III. at the leaſt, while that at <hi>Oxford</hi> was not built before <hi>Henry</hi> VII. But the famous Camps, and Military Ways, which ſtill appear at and near this Town, are a more viſible Teſtimony of its having been a very antient Town, and that it was conſiderable in the <hi>Romans</hi> Time.</p>
            <p>It is now a very fair, well-built, and wealthy Town, conſiſting of Six Pariſhes, including that of <hi>St. Martin</hi> in <hi>Stamford-baron</hi>; that is to ſay, in that Part of the Town which ſtands over the River, which, tho' it is not a Part of the Town, criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpeaking, being not in the Liberty, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other County, yet 'tis all called <hi>Stamford,</hi> and is rated with it in the Taxes.</p>
            <p>The Government of this Town is by a Mayor and Aldermen, and not, as ſome write, by an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and 12 Comburgeſſes.</p>
            <p>They boaſt in this Town of very great Privileges, eſpecially to their Mayor; ſuch as being freed from the Sheriff's Juriſdiction, and from being impanelled on Juries out of the Town; to have the Return of all Writs, to be freed from all Lords-Lieutenants, and from their Muſters, and for having the Militia of the Town commanded by their own Officers, the Mayor being the King's Lord-Lieutenant, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under his Majeſty's Command, and to be eſteemed (within the Liberties and Juriſdiction of the Town) the ſecond Man in the Kingdom; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0141100403:37"/>
the Grant of thoſe Privileges concludes thus: <hi>Ut ab antiquo uſu fuerunt,</hi> As of antient Time they had been accuſtomed: ſo that this Charter, which was granted by <hi>Edward</hi> IV. <hi>Anno</hi> 1461, ſeems to be only a Confirmation of former Privileges, not a Grant of new ones.</p>
            <p>In the Church of <hi>St. Martin</hi> in <hi>Stamford-baron,</hi> is a very noble Monument of <hi>William Cecil</hi> Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who lies buried there in a large Vault juſt under it; and oppoſite to it, on the North Side, is a more antient (but handſome) Monument, tho' not ſo magnificent as the former, in Memory of <hi>Richard Cecil,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Jane</hi> his Wife, the Father and Mother of the ſaid famous Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi>; alſo a more modern Monument for the great Earl who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edify'd the Houſe; and for his Counteſs, a Siſter of the late Duke of <hi>Devonſhire:</hi> this is a finiſhed Piece, 'tis all of the fineſt Marble, and was made at <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſent over. The ſaid Earl died on his Return from <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Iſſy</hi> near <hi>Paris, Aug.</hi> 29. 1700.</p>
            <p>There is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River <hi>Welland</hi> of Five Arches, and the Town-hall is in the Upper-part of the Gate, upon or at the End of the Bridge, which is a very handſome Building. Here are Two conſtant Weekly Markets, Three annual Fairs, and a great Midlent Mart; but the latter is not now ſo conſiderable, as it is reported to have been formerly.</p>
            <p>But the Beauty of <hi>Stamford</hi> is the Neighbourhood of the noble Palace of the Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> called <hi>Burleigh-houſe,</hi> built by the ſaid Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Houſe is ſituated in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi>; it is built all of Free-ſtone, looks more like a Town than a Houſe, at which Avenue ſoever you come to it; the Towers and the Pinacles ſo high, and placed at ſuch a Diſtance from one another, look like ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0141100403:38"/>
many diſtant Pariſh Churches in a great Town; and a large Spire covered with Lead, over the Clock in the Centre, looks like the Cathedral, or chief Church of the Town.</p>
            <p>The Houſe ſtands on an Eminence, which riſes from the North Entrance of the Park, coming from <hi>Stamford:</hi> on the other Side, <hi>viz.</hi> South and Weſt, the Country lies on a Level with the Houſe, and is a fine Plain, with Poſts, and other Marks for Horſe-races. As the Entrance looks towards the flat low Grounds of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> it gives the Houſe a moſt extraordinary Proſpect into the <hi>Fens,</hi> ſo that you may ſee from thence near 30 Miles, without any thing to intercept the Sight.</p>
            <p>As you mount the Hill, you come to a fine Eſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade, before the great Gate, or firſt Entrance of the Houſe, where is a ſmall, but very handſome Semicircle, taken in with an Iron Baluſtrade; and from this, riſing a few Steps, you enter a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hall, but made infinitely more noble by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Paintings, with which it is ſo filled, that there is not room to place any thing between them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> Grandfather of his preſent Lordſhip, had a great Genius for Painting and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and a ſuperior Judgment in both, as every Part of this noble Structure will teſtify; for he changed the whole Face of the Building, pulled down great Part of the Front next the Garden, and turned the old <hi>Gothick</hi> Windows into thoſe ſpacious Saſhes which are now ſeen there; and tho' the Founder, who had alſo an exquiſite Taſte, (as the Manner of Buildings then was) had ſo well ordered the Situation and Avenues of the whole Fabrick, that nothing was wanting of that Kind, and had alſo contrived the Houſe itſelf in a moſt magnificent manner, the Rooms ſpacious, the Ceilings lofty, and the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations juſt; yet the late Earl found Room for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, infinitely to the Advantage of the Whole;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0141100403:39"/>
as particularly, a noble Stair-caſe, a whole Suite of fine Apartments, with Rooms of State, fit for the Entertainment of a Prince, eſpecially thoſe on the Garden Side.</p>
            <p>As the noble Lord above-mentioned loved Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo he had infinite Advantage in procuring them; for he not only travelled Three times into <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſtay'd every time a conſiderable while at <hi>Florence</hi>; but his princely Deportment, and fine Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, procured him the perſonal Eſteem of the Great Duke, who aſſiſted him in the Purchace of many excellent Pieces, and likewiſe preſented him with ſeveral others of great Value.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt, there is, in the great Hall, his Lordſhip's Picture on Horſeback, done by the Great Duke's principal Painter, at his Highneſs's Charge, and given to his Lordſhip, as a Mark of ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: there is alſo a fine Piece of <hi>Seneca</hi> bleeding to Death in the warm Bath, and dictating his laſt Morals to his Scholars; a Piece ſo excellent, that I have been told, the late King of <hi>France</hi> offered the Earl 6000 Piſtoles for it.</p>
            <p>The Stair-caſe, the Ceilings of all the fine Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Chapel, the Hall, the late Earl's Cloſet, are all finely painted by the celebrated VARRIO, whom the Earl kept 12 Years in his Family, wholly imploy'd in them, and allow'd him a Coach and Horſes, an Equipage, a Table, and Servants, and a very conſiderable Penſion.</p>
            <p>By the Park Wall, or, as ſome think, thro' the Park, adjoining to <hi>Burleigh-houſe,</hi> paſſed an old <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, beginning at <hi>Caſter,</hi> a little Village near <hi>Peterborough</hi>; but which was antiently the <hi>Roman</hi> Station, or Colony, <hi>Durobrevum,</hi> as I have ſaid. This whole Town takes in Three Squares of full 300 Feet each, two of which are allotted to the Caſtle: the third is an Area lying to the Eaſt before it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Caſtle and the Hill, which is ſtill the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0141100403:40"/>
Market-place. From under the Caſtle-walls, almoſt quite round, riſe many quick Springs; but of theſe the <hi>Syfer</hi> Spring is the moſt noted, having now Four Fluxes of Water from between the Joints of great Stones, laid flat like a Wall, and join'd together with Lead, probably by the <hi>Romans,</hi> being under their Wall. It is very pleaſantly overſhaded with Trees. Its Name is <hi>Saxon,</hi> and ſignifies <hi>pure,</hi> which Appellation it well deſerves. The <hi>Roman</hi> Way is ſtill to be ſeen, and is now called <hi>The Forty-feet Way,</hi> paſſing from <hi>Gunworth Ferry</hi> (and <hi>Peterborough</hi>) to <hi>Stamford:</hi> This was, as the Antiquaries are of Opinion, the great Road into the <hi>North,</hi> which is ſince turned from <hi>Stilton</hi> in <hi>Huntingdonſhire,</hi> to <hi>Wandſworth</hi> or <hi>Wandsford,</hi> where is a very good Bridge over the the River <hi>Nyne</hi>; which coming down from <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> as I have obſerved already, paſſed thence by <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Fen</hi> Country. But I am of Opinion, neither this nor <hi>Wandsford</hi> was the antient <hi>Northern</hi> Road uſed by the <hi>Romans</hi>; for 'tis evident, that the great <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſway is ſtill ſeen on the Left-hand of that Road, and paſſing the <hi>Nyne</hi> at a Place called <hi>Water Neuton,</hi> went directly to <hi>Stamford,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Welland,</hi> juſt above that Town, but not in the Place where the Bridge ſtands now; and this <hi>Roman</hi> Way is ſtill to be ſeen, both on the South and the North Side of the <hi>Welland,</hi> ſtretching itſelf on to <hi>Brig Caſterton,</hi> a little Town upon the River <hi>Guaſh,</hi> about Three Miles beyond <hi>Stamford</hi>; which was, as all Writers agree, another <hi>Roman</hi> Station, and was called <hi>Guaſennae</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, from whence the River is ſuppoſed alſo to take its Name; whence it went on to <hi>Panton,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other very conſiderable Colony, and ſo to <hi>Newark,</hi> where it croſſed the <hi>Foſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the Road goes by <hi>Stretton</hi>; then leaves a little on the Left-hand <hi>Colſterworth,</hi> highly memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0141100403:41"/>
for being the Birth-place of the great Philoſopher, Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Forty-foot Way</hi> then muſt be a Croſs-road from <hi>Caſter,</hi> and by that from the <hi>Fen</hi> Country, ſo leading into the great Highway at <hi>Stamford:</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe another Croſs-road went out of the ſaid great Road at <hi>Panton,</hi> a Village of Antiquity near <hi>Ancaſter,</hi> to the Town of <hi>Ancaſter,</hi> where a <hi>Roman</hi> Cohort was ſtationed, and thence joined the <hi>Foſs</hi> again at <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near this little Village of <hi>Caſter</hi> lives the Lord <hi>Fitzwilliams,</hi> of an antient Family, but of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Title; his Lordſhip ſome Years ago built a very fine Stone Bridge over the River <hi>Nyne,</hi> near <hi>Gunworth,</hi> where formerly was the Ferry, as I have mentioned before; for the paſſing of which in a Coach, we paid 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we paſs by <hi>Burleigh-park</hi> Wall, on the great Road, we ſee on the Weſt Side, not above a Mile from it, another Houſe, built by the ſame Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and which might paſs for a very noble Seat, <hi>were not</hi> Burleigh <hi>by.</hi> This is called <hi>Wathorp,</hi> and ſtands juſt on the great <hi>Roman</hi> Way, mentioned above; this is the Houſe of which the old Earl is reputed to have ſaid, he built it to <hi>remove to, and to be out of the Duſt, while</hi> Burleigh-houſe <hi>was ſweeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we went to <hi>Oundle,</hi> being told that the famous Drum was to be heard at that time in the Well; but tho' we ſaw the Well, we heard no Drum, or any Noiſe at all. No Doubt, it is owing, if there be any thing in it, to the Paſſage of the Water and Air. Here are two long Stone Bridges. <hi>Lowick</hi> Church, on the Side of a Hill, is very fine. The Monuments of the Founder <hi>John de Drayton,</hi> of the <hi>Veres</hi> and <hi>Staffords,</hi> Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> &amp;c. are to be ſeen here: as is that of the late Ducheſs of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who, after her Divorce, married Sir <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0141100403:42"/>
               <hi>Germayn,</hi> of <hi>Drayton-houſe,</hi> who in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new built this antient Seat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oundle</hi> is almoſt ſurrounded by the River, over which it has Two handſome Stone Bridges. It is a neat, uniform-built Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nyne</hi> has a Range of eminent Towns along the Banks of it; <hi>viz. Northampton, Wellingborough, Higham-ferris, Thrapſton, Oundle, Foderinghay, Wandſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Peterborough,</hi> all in this County. The two firſt I have already mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Higham-ferris</hi> is a ſmall neat and healthful Mayor-town, pleaſantly ſeated on a riſing Ground, and is alſo an antient Borough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thrapſton</hi> is delightfully ſituated in a fine Valley, and ſurrounded wlth a rich Soil, and well water'd. It has a fine Bridge over the <hi>Nyne</hi>; but is not emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent either for Trade or Buildings; tho' it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſoon change its Face by virtue of an Act paſſed for making the <hi>Nyne</hi> navigable; which has had ſo good an Effect, that, when I was laſt there, the 17th of <hi>November</hi> 1737, on that very Day Boats were brought up to <hi>Thrapſton</hi> for the firſt time, which occaſioned much Joy in the Town.</p>
            <p>Here alſo is a moſt beautiful Range of Meadows and Paſtures, perhaps not to be equalled in <hi>England</hi> for Length. They ſtretch, uninterrupted, from <hi>Peterborough</hi> to <hi>Northampton,</hi> which is near 30 Miles in Length, and in ſome Places are near two Miles in Breadth; the Land rich, the Graſs fine, and the Cattle which feed on them, hardly to be number'd.</p>
            <p>North-weſt of this River lies <hi>Kettering,</hi> a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome well-frequented Town upon a riſing Ground; and beyond that again is <hi>Rothwell,</hi> a pretty good Market-town.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Oundle</hi> we travelled North-eaſt into <hi>Yarley</hi> in <hi>Huntingdonſhire,</hi> a little Town tolerably well built.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0141100403:43"/>
The Church has a neat lofty Spire. In our Way hither we croſſed the <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> Way. At <hi>Overton,</hi> now called <hi>Cherry Orton,</hi> a Village near <hi>Gunworth</hi> Ferry, is an old Manſion-houſe, formerly belonging to a very antient and almoſt forgotten Family of great Men, called <hi>Lovetoft.</hi> On the other Side of the River, is the fine Houſe I mentioned before, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sir <hi>Francis St. John,</hi> Bart. which affords a very beautiful Proſpect to Travellers, as they paſs from the Hill beyond <hi>Stilton</hi> to <hi>Wandsford</hi> Bridge. This <hi>Wandsford</hi> has obtained an idle Addition to its Name, from a Story firmly believed by the Country People; <hi>viz.</hi> That a great Flood coming haſtily down the River <hi>Nyne,</hi> in Hay-making-time, a Country Fellow, having taken up his Lodging on a Cock of Hay in the Meadow, was driven, on the Hay, down the Stream in the Night, while he was faſt aſleep, towards <hi>Wisbech</hi> in the <hi>Fens</hi>; when being wakened, he was ſeen and taken up by ſome Fiſhermen, almoſt in the open Sea; and being aſked, Where he lived? he anſwered, <hi>At</hi> Wansford <hi>in</hi> England. And we ſaw at the great Inn, by the South End of the Bridge, the Sign of a Man floating on a Cock of Hay, and over him written <hi>Wandsford in England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Falling down Southward we come to <hi>Stilton,</hi> a Town famous for Cheeſe, which is called our <hi>Engliſh Parmeſan,</hi> and is brought to Table ſo full of Mites or Maggots, that they uſe a Spoon to eat them. We came again into the <hi>Roman</hi> Way at <hi>Stilton,</hi> which comes from <hi>Caſter</hi> aforementioned, and runs all the way to <hi>Huntingdon</hi>; which we followed thro' <hi>Sautery-lane,</hi> a deep Deſcent between two Hills, in which is <hi>Stangate-hole,</hi> noted for being the greateſt Robbing-place in all this Part of the County, and ſo came to <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> antiently called <hi>Hunters-dune,</hi> the County-town, ſituated on a riſing Ground, on the North Side of the <hi>Ouſe.</hi> It is a great Thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair on the Northern Road, and is full of very good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0141100403:44"/>
Inns, and is a ſtrong Paſs upon the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and in the late Civil Wars, it was eſteemed ſo by both Parties. It was given by King <hi>Stephen</hi> to <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as an Augmentation to his Eſtate, and taken away by King <hi>Henry</hi> II. However, the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Kings always claimed it.</p>
            <p>It is a Mayor-town, and had antiently Fifteen Churches; of later Days, but Four, and in the Civil Wars they were reduced to Two. The Cauſe of its Decay at firſt, is ſaid to be owing to a Court Minion, who procur'd the Paſſage of the <hi>Ouſe</hi> to be ſtopped, which had been navigable to the Town. The ſaid River is now made navigable for ſmaller Veſſels to <hi>Bedford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Witches of <hi>Warbois,</hi> in this County, have made ſo much Noiſe, that I ſhall juſt mention the fatal End of a Man, his Wife and Daughter, who were all Three hanged for torturing the Children of a Gentleman in the Pariſh: the Hiſtory of it is kept in <hi>Queen's</hi> College Library in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; and one of their Fellows preaches yearly, at <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> on that Occaſion. The Children being ſick, their Urine was ſent to Maſter Dr. <hi>Dorrington</hi> at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who ſent a Medicine againſt Worms. That prevailing nothing, the Doctor, upon ſecond Thoughts, pronounced the Symptoms were from Witchcraft. It was not long before a proper Family was ſuſpected: the Woman and her Daughter were frequently ſent for, and kept with the Children, and the Diſeaſe remitted upon the Sight of them; but chiefly upon a Confeſſion, and a ſort of Petition added to it. To this Effect was the Girl's: <hi>As I am a Witch, and a greater Witch than my Mother, ſo I deſire, that the Pains ſhall go off from this Child.</hi> Theſe Confeſſions were the chief Point againſt the Priſoners, which they had been prevailed upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat by the Stranders-by, who had obſerved the Children relieved upon it, as they imagined. And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0141100403:45"/>
thus Three unhappy Perſons were ſacrificed to Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take farther Notice of this Subject when I come to <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> a County formerly famous for Witches, and where Perſons likewiſe ſuffered for this pretended Crime.</p>
            <p>Here are the moſt beautiful Meadows on the Banks of the River <hi>Ouſe,</hi> that I think are to be ſeen in any Part of <hi>England</hi>; which, in the Summer Seaſon, are covered with ſuch numerous Herds of Cattle, and Flocks of Sheep, as are hardly credible.</p>
            <p>This Town is one long continued Street, pretty well built, eſpecially from the Ground Plot, where the Caſtle ſtood. Here was born <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> of genteel and worthy Parents. The Houſe is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, but the Room in which he was born is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in its firſt State. It has a good Market-place; but the Free-ſtone Bridge, or Bridges rather, and Cauſway over the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> are a very great Ornament as well as Benefit to the Place. Here is a good Publick School.</p>
            <p>Between <hi>Godmancheſter,</hi> or <hi>Gormancheſter,</hi> (a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Camp) and <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> is a wooden Bridge erected over a Rivulet, upon Principles of Gratitude and publick Charity, with this Inſcription:
<q>ROBERTUS COOK <hi>emergens aquis hoc viatoribus</hi>
                  <lb/>
                  <hi>Sacrum D.D.</hi> 1636.</q> That is:
<q>ROBERT COOK, <hi>having eſcaped the Danger of Drowning, conſecrated this for the Uſe of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> 1636.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the Weſt Side of this Town, and in View of the plain lower Side of the County, is a noble, tho' antient Seat of the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi>; the Gardens very fine and well kept; the Situation ſeems a little obſcured by the Town of <hi>Huntingdon.</hi> In the ſame
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0141100403:46"/>
Plain we ſaw <hi>Bugden,</hi> a ſmall Village, in which is a very pleaſant, tho' antient Houſe or Palace of the Biſhops of <hi>Lincoln:</hi> the Houſe and Garden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a very large and deep Moat of Water. The Chapel is very pretty, tho' ſmall. There is an Organ painted againſt the Wall, in a ſeeming Organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and ſo properly placed, and well painted, that we at firſt believed it really to be one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erith</hi> is a large Town, but without a Market.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Ives</hi> is a pretty neat Market-town, but is leſſen'd, and ſuffer'd greatly by Fire. Here <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> after he had prodigally waſted his paternal Eſtate, rented a Farm, before he was elected Burgeſs for <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Hinchinbroke-houſe,</hi> which gives Title of a Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the eldeſt Son of the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and the Village of the ſame Name, lie at a ſmall Diſtance from <hi>Huntingdon.</hi> And a little Way South-weſt ſtands the Town of <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and that moſt nobly ſituated and pleaſant Seat of the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Kimbolton</hi> Caſtle, where no Pains or Coſt has been ſpared tu improve the moſt beautiful Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in Nature with the Works and Ornaments of Art.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kimbolton</hi> Town is the <hi>Kiniubantum</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Here Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> after ſhe was divorced, reſided for ſome time.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Ailweſton,</hi> in this County, are two Springs, one of freſh Water, good for dim Eyes; the other brackiſh, of Uſe for curing of Scabs, Leproſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Huntingdon</hi> we came to <hi>St. Neots</hi> on the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> over which is a good Stone Bridge. The Church is ſtrong and well built, and the Steeple manifeſts the Skill of the Artiſt, much to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Town takes its Name from <hi>Neotus,</hi> a learned and pious Man, who was interred here; from whom likewiſe <hi>St. Neots,</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> takes its Name, where he for ſome time reſided. Hither
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0141100403:47"/>
Coals are brought by Water, and convey'd by Land around the Country.</p>
            <p>Here we enter'd <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> and came to <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the chief Town; for it has no City in it, tho' this Town is larger and more populous than ſeveral Cities in <hi>England.</hi> It is one of the Seven Counties, which, they ſay, lie together, and have not one City among them; namely, <hi>Huntingdon, Bedford, Bucks, Berks, Hertford, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that tho' a great Part of this County, <hi>viz.</hi> the two whole Hundreds of <hi>Stodden</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> lie on the North of the <hi>Ouſe</hi>; yet there is but one Market-town in all that Side of the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> beſide <hi>Bedford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo remarkable, that tho' the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> by a long and winding Courſe, cuts thro' the County, ſo as to make above 70 Miles between <hi>Oulney</hi> and <hi>St. Neots,</hi> not above 20 by Land, yet in all that Courſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives only the little River <hi>Ivel,</hi> which falls into it a little above <hi>Temsford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bedford</hi> is a large, populous, thriving, pleaſant, and well-built Mayor-town; it has five Pariſh Churches, a very fine Stone Bridge over the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and the High Street (eſpecially) is very handſome and well-built: here is alſo a fair Market-place; but it is much improved lately in new Buildings. The River hath alſo been made navigable, and runs thro' the Town. It had formerly a Caſtle, and now, where it ſtood, is one of the moſt beautiful Bowling-greens in the Kingdom. It has Two Hoſpitals for Lazars, and another for Eight poor People. Here is a Free-ſchool well endow'd, and a Charity-ſchool for Forty Children, and tho' the Town is not upon any of the great Roads in <hi>England,</hi> yet it is full of very good Inns, which afford elegant Entertainment; for here is the beſt Market for all Sorts of Proviſions, that is to be ſeen at any Country Town in all theſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0141100403:48"/>
Parts of <hi>England</hi>; and the Reaſon of it is, that, tho' it is ſo far from <hi>London,</hi> yet the Higglers or Carriers buy great Quantities of Proviſions here for the <hi>London</hi> Markets; here alſo is a very good Trade down the River to <hi>Lynn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here likewiſe is a great Corn-market, and vaſt Quantities of Grain are bought here, and carried down by large Veſſels and Barges to <hi>Lynn,</hi> where it is again ſhipped, and carried by Sea to <hi>Holland.</hi> The Soil hereabouts is exceeding rich and fertile, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly produces great Quantities of the beſt Wheat in <hi>England,</hi> which is carried by Waggons from hence, and from the North Part of the Country 20 Miles beyond this, to the Markets of <hi>Hitchin</hi> and <hi>Hertford,</hi> and bought again there, and ground and carried in the Meal (ſtill by Land) to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the whole Product of this County may be ſaid to be Wheat and Malt for <hi>London</hi>; for here are very few Manufactures, except thoſe of Straw Hats and Bone Lace; of which by itſelf. There are but Ten Market-towns in the whole County, which I ſhall recount as I took them in my Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Potton,</hi> which lies on the Borders of <hi>Cambridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and of no Note. Southward ſtands</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Biggleſwade,</hi> a pleaſant ſituated Place on the <hi>Ivel,</hi> and furniſhed with a great Number of good Inns for accommodating Travellers between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> Still more Southward lies</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shefford,</hi> between two Rivulets; over each of which is a Bridge.</p>
            <p>Weſt of this Town ſtands <hi>Ampthill,</hi> a pretty Town, delightfully ſeated between two Hills. Near it is a large Park, with a great Manſion-houſe in it, which King <hi>Charles</hi> II. gave to the Noble Family of <hi>Bruce,</hi> who had their Title of Viſcount from this Town; notwithſtanding which, and that they were always Hereditary Stewards of the <hi>Manor</hi> of <hi>Ampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0141100403:49"/>
yet the preſent Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> lately ſold his whole Eſtate here to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Bedford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> after ſhe was divorced, choſe this Town as one of her Retiring-places. Farther Southward is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woburn,</hi> noted for having Plenty of Fullers Earth near it; and likewiſe another Kind of Earth, which petrifies Wood into Stone. This Town, having been almoſt demoliſhed by a terrible Fire, which happened a few Years ago, is now rebuilt, and makes no mean Appearance. It belongs almoſt all of it to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who finiſhed, in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1737, a fine and commodious Market-place here.</p>
            <p>The Duke's Houſe, called <hi>Woburn Abbey,</hi> is juſt by the Town, a good old Houſe, and exceedingly pleaſant by its Situation, which is in a fine large Park walled round. The Duke had once deſigned to have pulled down the old Houſe, and to rebuild it in a magnificent manner: but laid aſide that Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and only repaired it. There are many noble Rooms in it, and particularly a very capacious and long Gallery, furniſhed with a great Variety of fine Pictures, chiefly of the <hi>Ruſſel</hi> Family: the Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoting of this noble Apartment is ſtrewed, as one may ſay, with gilded Stars, which have a pretty Effect among the Pictures. A Room has been laid into this Gallery at one End, where a good Billiard-table is placed.</p>
            <p>Before the Houſe is a very large Baſon of Water, ſurrounded with a fine broad Gravel-walk, which is bounded with Poſts and Iron Chains. On the Water is a moſt beautiful Yacht of between 30 and 40 Tons Burden, elegantly carved and gilt, and completely rigged, and mounts Ten Guns, which are fired on Occaſion of Entertainments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> given on Board her by his Grace. There is alſo an elegant Boat with a fine Awning over it, a Wherry of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Shape, and a Skiff, which are very neat, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0141100403:50"/>
make a beautiful Appearance on this noble Baſon of Water.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Woburn</hi> is <hi>Battleſden,</hi> the Seat of <hi>Thomas Page,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> abounding with many Beauties, and ſtill daily improving by additional Works in a very fine Taſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunſtable</hi> is ſeated on a Hill, in a chalky Ground, in the County of <hi>Bedford.</hi> It conſiſts of Four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Streets, anſwering to the Four Quarters of the World. It is well inhabited, and furniſhed with many good Inns for the Accommodation of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. In the Centre ſtood one of Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s beautiful Croſſes, which was demoliſhed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Soldiers. The Situation of this Place being high, and no running Water near, they are forced to draw it up from deep Wells by means of great Wheels; and they have Four large Ponds to receive the Rain-water, which, as a Mark of the holding Quality of the Soil, are never dry, tho' they have no other Supply. They have ſometimes dug 24 Fathoms deep, in Search of Springs, to no Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kingſbury,</hi> once a Royal Seat, over-againſt the Church, is now a Farm-houſe. The Church is compoſed of many Pieces tacked together, as it were, ſome of which are very old. It was Part of the Priory, and Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> was the laſt Prior, who here pronounced the Sentence of Divorce againſt Queen <hi>Catharine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentlemen of <hi>Bedford</hi> lately came to a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reſolution of levelling the Chalk-hill near this Town, for the Benefit of the Road, which in a Froſt, or after a Snower of Rain, uſed to be ſo ſlippery that neither Man nor Horſe could keep their Feet, which occaſioned often great Damage to both; to prevent which for the future, they imploy'd a Number of Hands to lower it.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0141100403:51"/>
been <hi>Roman</hi> Coins frequently found; and on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of <hi>Chiltern</hi> Hills, not far from the Town, is a large round Area of Nine Acres, ſurrounded with a deep Ditch and Rampire called <hi>Mardin-hour.</hi> It was burnt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and rebuilt by <hi>Henry</hi> I. to repreſs a vaſt Number of Robbers which infeſted the Country thereabouts; and it takes its Name from <hi>Dunning,</hi> one of the Thieves, and from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningceſtaple</hi> it is now, by Contraction, called <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</hi>

            <p>North-eaſt of <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> lies <hi>Luton,</hi> a little pretty Town, ſeated very pleaſantly amongſt Hills, and noted for a good Market and Market-place.</p>
            <p>This County is remarkable for having more Noblemens and Gentlemens Seats in it than any County in <hi>England.</hi> The Middle Part of the County is well ſtored with Wood, which affords a great deal of Game.</p>
            <p>Thro' the whole South Part of this County, as far as the Borders of <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> and <hi>Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> the People are taken up with the Manufacture of Bone-lace, in which they are wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and improved.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Manufactures of Straw-work, eſpecially Straw Hats, ſpreads itſelf from <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> into this County, and is greatly increaſed within a few Years paſt.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed this County in all its moſt conſiderable Towns, we came from <hi>Dunſtable</hi> to <hi>St. Albans,</hi> where we ſaw the handſome Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes built and endow'd by the <hi>Marlborough</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo returned to <hi>London.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING finiſhed the Account of my ſeveral Circuits, which complete the Southern Part of <hi>Britain</hi>; I am now to begin this Circuit from the River <hi>Trent,</hi> and to confine my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Country, which is called by ſome <hi>North by Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River <hi>Trent</hi> is deemed by antient Writers as the fourth capital River in <hi>England,</hi> the other three being the <hi>Thames,</hi> the <hi>Severn,</hi> and the <hi>Humber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Trent</hi> is not the largeſt, yet it may be ſaid to run the longeſt Courſe, and riſes nearer to the Weſt Side of the Iſland than any of the others; it is alſo the largeſt, and of the longeſt Courſe of any River in <hi>England,</hi> which does not empty its Waters immediately into the Sea; for the <hi>Trent</hi> runs into the <hi>Humber,</hi> and ſo loſes its Name before it reaches the Ocean.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0141100403:53"/>It riſes in the Highlands of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> called the <hi>Moorlands,</hi> receiving from the Edge of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and towards <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> a great many (ſome ſay 30, and that thence it had its Name, for <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>French</hi> is 30) little Rivulets into it, very near its Head; ſo that it ſoon becomes one large River, and comes down from the Hills with a violent Current into the flat Country; where, being increaſed by ſeveral other little Rivers, it carries a deeper Chanel, and a ſtiller Current; and having given its Name to <hi>Trentham,</hi> a ſmall Market-town in the ſame County, it goes on to <hi>Stone,</hi> a conſiderable Town on the great Road to <hi>Weſt Cheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Branch of the <hi>Trent</hi> riſes within a Quarter of a Mile of the <hi>Dane,</hi> from a Moor adjoining to a little Ridge of Hills, called <hi>Molecop Hill,</hi> near <hi>Congleton,</hi> within 22 Miles of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea. As the <hi>Dane</hi> runs into the <hi>Weaver,</hi> and both into that Arm of the Sea, which the <hi>Merſee</hi> makes from <hi>Frodſham</hi> to <hi>Liverpool</hi> and <hi>Hyle-lake</hi>; and as the <hi>Trent</hi> runs into the <hi>Humber,</hi> which opens into the great <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ocean; theſe Rivers may be ſaid to cut the Iſland acroſs in the middle.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Northern Part is much larger than the Southern, now <hi>Scotland</hi> is united; otherwiſe the Country South by <hi>Trent,</hi> including <hi>Wales,</hi> is by far the largeſt, as well as the richeſt and moſt populous, occaſioned chiefly by the Commerce of the City of <hi>London.</hi> As for the Towns of <hi>Briſtol, Exeter, Lynn, Norwich, Yarmouth, &amp;c.</hi> which are large and very populous, and carry on a prodigious Trade, as well in Merchandize as Manufacture, we ſhall find them pretty near equalled by the Towns of <hi>Liverpool, Hull, Leeds, Newcaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Trent</hi> runs a Courſe of near 200 Miles, thro' the four Counties of <hi>Stafford, Derby, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln.</hi> It receives, beſides leſſer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0141100403:54"/>
Waters, the larger Rivers of the <hi>Sowe</hi> from the Weſt Side of the County, and from the Town of <hi>Stafford</hi>; the <hi>Tame</hi> from <hi>Birmingham</hi> and <hi>Tamworth,</hi> the <hi>Soar</hi> from <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and the <hi>Dove</hi> and <hi>Derwent,</hi> two furiouſly rapid Streams, from the <hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>; the <hi>Idle,</hi> a gentle navigable Stream, from <hi>Rhet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> with part of the <hi>Witham,</hi> called the <hi>Foſs-dike,</hi> from <hi>Lincoln,</hi> alſo navigable; and the greateſt of them all, the <hi>Dun,</hi> from <hi>Doncaſter, Rotheram,</hi> and <hi>Sheffield,</hi> after a long and rapid Courſe thro' the Moors, called <hi>Stanecroſs,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the Weſt Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Trent</hi> is navigable by Ships of good Burden as high as <hi>Gainsborough,</hi> which is near 40 Miles from the <hi>Humber</hi> by the River. The Barges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Help of Locks or Stops go as high as <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi>; and farther by the Help of Art, to <hi>Burton</hi> upon this River in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi> The Stream is full, the Chanel deep and ſafe, and the Tide flows up to <hi>Gainsborough</hi> and <hi>Newark.</hi> The Navigation, by theſe Advantages, is a great Support to the Trade of thoſe Counties which border upon it, eſpecially the Cheeſe Trade from <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> which have otherwiſe no Navigation but from theſe Parts about <hi>Weſt Cheſter</hi> to <hi>London</hi>; whereas by this River it is brought by Water to <hi>Hull,</hi> and from thence to all the South and North Coaſts on the Eaſt Side of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Towns of Note ſtanding upon the North Shore of <hi>Trent,</hi> are <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak in their Order.</p>
            <p>The Counties North of <hi>Trent</hi> are <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> which may not improperly be called three Counties, as it is divided into three Ridings, each equal to ſome large Counties; <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> which is very large; <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> which are more Southerly. I ſhall begin with theſe two, and take them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0141100403:55"/>Beginning at the Mouth of <hi>Trent,</hi> the firſt Town of Note that I met with is <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the Capital of that Shire, and the moſt conſiderable in all that Part of <hi>England.</hi> The County is ſmall, but, like the <hi>Peak,</hi> full of Wonders. (1.) 'Tis remarkable for its Situation, being bounded intirely by four Counties, and thoſe towards the four Cardinal Points, a Circumſtance peculiar to this County only. (2) For its Soil, which on the South Part is the richeſt and moſt fruitful, and in the North Part the moſt wild and waſte, even almoſt to Barrenneſs, of any Part of <hi>England</hi> within many Miles of it. (3.) For the fine Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen, eſpecially thoſe of the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk, Kingſton, Rutland, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> Lord <hi>Middleton,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nottingham</hi> is one of the moſt pleaſant and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Towns in <hi>England,</hi> from its Situation, were its Buildings not to be named.</p>
            <p>It is ſituated on the ſteep Aſcent of a Hill or Rock, overlooking a fine Range of Meadows of great Extent; a little Rivulet running on the North Side of them, almoſt cloſe to the Town: and the noble River <hi>Trent,</hi> parallel with both, on the South Side of the Meadows. Over the <hi>Trent</hi> is a ſtately Stone Bridge of 19 Arches, where the River is very large and deep, having received the Addition of the <hi>Dove,</hi> the <hi>Derwent,</hi> the <hi>Irwaſh,</hi> and the <hi>Soar,</hi> three of them very great Rivers of themſelves, which fall into it, after its paſſing by <hi>Burton</hi> in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> mentioned before.</p>
            <p>The Rock whereon the Town ſtands is of a ſandy kind, and ſo ſoft, that it is hewed into Vaults and Cellars, and yet ſo firm, as to ſupport the Roofs of theſe Cellars, two or three under one another. The Stairs which lead to theſe Vaults are cut out of the Rock, two or three Stories deep, to 80 Steps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: And theſe Cellars are well ſtock'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ale, of which the Inhabitants are very liberal
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0141100403:56"/>
among their Acquaintance, as ſome in our Company experienc'd.</p>
            <p>The Hill or Rock was called of old the <hi>Dolorous Hill,</hi> or <hi>Golgotha,</hi> becauſe of a great Slaughter of the antient <hi>Britons</hi> there by King <hi>Humber,</hi> a pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Northern Monarch; who, being afterwards drowned between <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Barton,</hi> gave Name, as 'tis ſaid, to that Arm of the Sea which is now called the <hi>Humber,</hi> and receives the <hi>Trent,</hi> and almoſt all the great Rivers of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> into it; tho' others derive the Name from the dreadful Noiſe of its Waves.</p>
            <p>They tell us, that theſe Caves and Cellars ſerved the People for a Retreat from their Enemies, and that from thence the Town firſt took its Name, which was <hi>Snottengaham,</hi> ſignifying hollow Vaults in a Rock, <hi>Speluncarum Domus</hi>; and, as Mr. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> obſerves, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word was <hi>Tui ogo bauc,</hi> which ſignifies the ſame as the <hi>Latin,</hi> a Houſe of Dens, or ſecret Caves to hide in.</p>
            <p>Beſides the delightful Situation of <hi>Nottingham</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River, it is equally pleaſant to the Land Side, towards the Foreſt on the North of the Town; where is a fine Plain for a Horſe-courſe, where Races uſed to be run once a Year.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt End of the Town is a very ſteep Hill, and at the South Side of it a Cliff, which falls in a Precipice down to the River. On this Hill ſtood a Caſtle of ſo great Antiquity, that the Time of its firſt Erection could never be traced. The firſt Account we read of it, is, that there was a Tower here which the <hi>Danes</hi> obſtinately defended againſt King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Aethelred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the ſame Situation <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, or, as others, with greater Probability, maintain, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Peverell,</hi> his natural Son, built another Caſtle; which was afterwards repaired, or rather rebuilt, by <hi>Edward</hi> IV. who added fine Apartments to it,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0141100403:57"/>
which <hi>Richard</hi> III. his Brother, ſtill farther inlarg'd; whereby it became in time very conſiderable, and ſo ſtrong, that nothing could reduce it but Famine. 'Tis certain it has not undergone the ordinary Fate of other fortified Places, to be often taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; for it was never ſtorm'd. Once indeed it was taken by Surprize in the Barons Wars by <hi>Robert</hi> Earl <hi>Ferrers,</hi> who alſo plundered the Town, or City, as it was then called.</p>
            <p>The People here tell us of one of the <hi>Davids,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being kept Priſoner in it; and that <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> was hid in a Vault under Ground, which they call <hi>Mortimer's-hole,</hi> whence he was taken, and hang'd for Treaſon.</p>
            <p>This Report has ſome Foundation in Hiſtory, but is ſo obſcured by vulgar Tradition, that it led Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> firſt into ſome Miſtakes in his Narration, and afterwards into a Disbelief of it. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> with the Queen, the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and others, being poſſeſſed of the Caſtle, could have no Reaſon to hide himſelf under Ground: but it was by this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Paſſage, which goes by Steps thro' the Rock up to the <hi>Keep,</hi> that Sir <hi>William Montacute,</hi> with others, 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. found means, in the Dead of the Night, to ſeize him; and, ſending him up to the Tower, he was there beheaded.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle was granted by K. <hi>James</hi> I. to <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi>; and K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. made it remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by erecting there his Royal Standard, 1642; but he ſoon quitted it, and the Parliament kept Poſſeſſion of it till the End of the War, when it was ordered to be demoliſhed. Some Parts of it however were ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Reſtoration, when <hi>George Villiers,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whoſe Mother was the ſole Heir of the foreſaid Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> ſold it to <hi>William Cavendiſh,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> He, in 1674, cleared the Foundations of the old Tower, a ſmall Part excepted, and founded the noble Structure which is now ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0141100403:58"/>
and devolved to the Houſe of <hi>Pelham.</hi> The preſent Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> beautified it, and wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoted the Rooms with Cedar, and had laid out a Plan for the fineſt Gardens in all that Part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being to contain no leſs than 60 Acres; but the Deſign is changed, and the intended Gardens are made a Park.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle, built on a high perpendicular Rock, as I have hinted, ſeems to have been modell'd after ſome of the Draughts of <hi>Inigo Jones.</hi> There are many good Pictures in it; and it commands a vaſt Proſpect. The South Side of the Rock is altogether inacceſſible, and vaſt ſubterraneous Grottoes are cut underneath; and a winding Stair-caſe quite to the Bottom ends in <hi>Mortimer's-hole,</hi> above-mention'd.</p>
            <p>This Caſtle at preſent is much neglected, being ſtripp'd of its beſt Furniture and Hangings, and the Floors of ſome of the nobleſt Apartments ſuffer'd to fall in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s Church is a fine lightſome <hi>Gothick</hi> Building, with a good Ring of 8 Bells; but the great Tower makes a mean Appearance. The Butchers Shambles is an old Edifice built for a Granary.</p>
            <p>They ſhew'd us the Gardens of Count <hi>Tallard,</hi> who, in his Confinement here, after having been taken Priſoner by the renowned Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> at the glorious Battle of <hi>Blenheim,</hi> amuſed himſelf with making a ſmall, but beautiful Parterre, after the <hi>French</hi> Taſte, which happens not to be the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with us at preſent. 'Tis ſaid likewiſe, that this gallant Gentleman left behind him here ſome <hi>living</hi> Memorandums of his great Affection and Eſteem for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies.</p>
            <p>A handſome Town-houſe upon Piazzas has been erected within theſe few Years, for the tranſacting of the Buſineſs of the Corporation. Not many Years ago, the Hall where the Aſſizes were held
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0141100403:59"/>
gave ſuch a Crack, that the People were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly frighted, and all ran out of it, leaving Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powis</hi> upon the Bench, calling out after them, <hi>Is there nobody will take care of the Judge?</hi> for he was ſo aged and infirm that he could hardly walk. But, finding himſelf neglected, he made ſhift to deſcend from the Bench, and hobble out at the Door, where he denounc'd Vengeance againſt the Town, which, with a very ſeaſonable Piece of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he fin'd, for neglecting to keep the Hall in Repair.</p>
            <p>The Town has been at great Expence in making the <hi>Trent</hi> navigable here for Veſſels or Barges of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by which all their heavy and bulky Goods are brought from the <hi>Humber,</hi> and even from <hi>Hull</hi>; ſuch as Iron, Block-tin, Salt, Hops, Grocery, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Wares, Wine, Oil, Tar, Hemp, Flax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſame Veſſels bring down Lead, Coal, Wood, and Corn; as alſo Cheeſe in great Quantities from <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> and <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> as I have already mentioned.</p>
            <p>When I ſaid the Bridge over <hi>Trent</hi> had nineteen Arches, I might have ſaid alſo it was a Mile long; for the <hi>Trent,</hi> the laſt Time I was there, being ſwelled over its ordinary Bounds, reached quite up to the Town: yet a high Cauſeway, with Arches at proper Diſtances, carried us dry over the whole Breadth of the Meadows, which, I think, is at leaſt a Mile, and may juſtly be called a Bridge, as that at <hi>Swarſton,</hi> and alſo that of <hi>Poul Spooder</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> are called.</p>
            <p>The chief Manufacture carried on here is Frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work-knitting of Stockens, the ſame as at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and ſome Glaſs, and earthen Ware. The latter is much increaſed by the Conſumption of Tea-pots, Cups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince the Increaſe of Tea-drinking, as the Glaſs-houſes, I think, are of late rather decreas'd. A Proof, one would think, that the Luxury of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0141100403:60"/>
Males is leſs predominant than that of the Females; or, rather as ſome would ſay, that the Men are brought over by the Ladies to join with them in the Love of the Tea-table: and indeed the latter ſeems pretty much the Caſe; whether it be owing to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Complaiſance, or to Effeminacy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, let thoſe concerned in the Obſervation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>As they brew very good Liquor here, ſo they make the beſt Malt (and more of it) of any Town in this Part of <hi>England,</hi> and ſend it by Land-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>Derby,</hi> thro' all the <hi>Peak,</hi> as far as <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and to other Towns in <hi>Lancaſhire, Cheſhire,</hi> and even into <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> itſelf; for which Purpoſe all the Low Lands of this County, and eſpecially on the Banks of the <hi>Trent,</hi> are made to yield prodigious Crops of Barley.</p>
            <p>The Government of <hi>Nottingham</hi> is in a Mayor, Recorder, ſix Aldermen, two Coroners, two She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, two Chamberlains, and 24 Common-council, whereof ſix are called Juniors. Here they hold a Court of Pleas. They have two Sergeants at Mace, and another Officer, which they call a Bill-bearer, and two more called Pindars, one for the Fields, and the other for the Meadows. The firſt is alſo the Town Woodward, and attends the Foreſt Courts; for this Town is within the Juriſdiction of the Foreſt.</p>
            <p>I might enter into a long Deſcription of all the modern Buildings erected lately at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> but that would be too great a Taſk; only I muſt take Notice of the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Plumtre,</hi> which is juſtly to be admired for its elegant Front; and obſerve in general, that as the Caſtle has oftener been the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Kings and Queens, than any other Place ſo far diſtant from <hi>London</hi>; ſo the Town has more Gentlemens Houſes, than any other of its Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> One may eaſily gueſs <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0141100403:61"/>
to have been an antient Town of the <hi>Britons.</hi> As ſoon as they had proper Tools, they fell to work upon the Rocks, which every-where offer themſelves ſo commodiouſly to make Houſes in; one Inſtance of which, tho' perhaps not old enough to be form'd on theirs, is a Ledge of perpendicular Rock in the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Park, hewn into a Church, Houſes, Chambers, Dove-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Church is like thoſe in the Rocks of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> The Altar is natural Rock, and there has been Painting on the Wall, a Steeple, where, perhaps, was a Bell, and regular Pillars. The River here wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, makes a Fortification to it; for it comes to both Ends of the Cliff, leaving a Plain before the middle. The Way to it was by Gates cut out of the Rock, and with an <hi>oblique</hi> Entrance for more Safety.</p>
            <p>Between this and the Caſtle is an Hermitage of like Workmanſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clifton,</hi> in this Neighbourhood, is a good Seat, with pretty Gardens, and a noble Proſpect; and in the Church are many old Braſſes of the <hi>Clifton</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Three Miles from <hi>Nottingham</hi> is <hi>Wallaton-hall,</hi> the Seat of my Lord <hi>Middleton,</hi> and the nobleſt Building in this County, except <hi>Belvoir,</hi> which only exceeds it in Spaciouſneſs, but not in Beauty.</p>
            <p>The Park, incloſed within a Brick Wall, is much finer than the great Park adjoming to the Caſtle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> being much better planted with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; whereas that at <hi>Nottingham</hi> was all cut down, and ſequeſtred in the late Wars.</p>
            <p>There is a pretty Summer-houſe panelled and ceiled with Looking-glaſs, which produces a pleaſant Effect. Underneath is a Water-houſe, with groteſque Work of Shells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Hall at the firſt Entrance into the Houſe, is ſo high, that a Man on Horſe-back might exerciſe a Pike in it.</p>

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0141100403:62"/>The Foreſt of <hi>Shirwood</hi> is an Addition to <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> for the Pleaſure it affords of Hunting. There are alſo ſome fine Parks and noble Houſes in it, as <hi>Welbeck,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s, now Lord <hi>Oxford</hi>'s; and <hi>Thoresby,</hi> the preſent noble Seat of the <hi>Pierrepoints,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Kingſton,</hi> which lies at the fartheſt Edge of the Foreſt. But this Foreſt is now given up, in a manner, to Waſte: even the Woods, which formerly made it famous for Thieves, are deſtroyed, ſo that <hi>Robin Hood</hi> would now hardly find Shelter for a Week; nor is there any Store of Deer now left, at leaſt not worth mentioning.</p>
            <p>From this Foreſt, I went purpoſely out of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Way, to take a View of the Collegiate Church of <hi>Southwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Southwell</hi> is a Market-town in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> its Church is both Parochial and Collegiate; which, I think, is the Caſe of no other in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Rippon</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> To it belong ſixteen Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries or Canons, ſix Vicars Choral, an Organiſt, ſix Singing Men, ſix Choriſters, beſides ſix Boys who attend as Probationers, a Regiſter to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, a Treaſurer, an Auditor, a Virger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Church is generally ſuppoſed to be founded by <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the firſt Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> about the Year 630. It was ſurrendered to the King, 32d <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and was actually in the King's Poſſeſſion, until by Act of Parliament, 35 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. it was refounded, and reſtored to its antient Privilege, and incorporated by the Name of <hi>The Chapter of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Church of the bleſſed</hi> Mary, <hi>the Virgin of</hi> Southwell.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> confirmed its Privileges; as did afterwards, on a Tryal at Law, King <hi>James</hi> I.</p>
            <p>The Chapter have a peculiar Juriſdiction, and there are 28 Pariſhes ſubject to it, to moſt of which they have the Right of Preſentation; beſides ſome others in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> This Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is exerciſed by a Commiſſary, or Vicar
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0141100403:63"/>
General, choſen by the Chapter out of their Body, who holds Viſitations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> twice a Year. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there are two Synods yearly, to which all the Clergy of the County of <hi>Nottingham</hi> pay their Attendance; and a certain Number of the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, and others of the conſiderable Clergy, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Commiſſioners by a Commiſſion granted by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> to preſide at the Synods.</p>
            <p>The Civil Government of the Juriſdiction of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> is diſtinct from the County at large. It is called the <hi>Soke</hi> of <hi>Southwell cum Scrooby,</hi> which is another Town in this County. There are about twenty Towns ſubject to this Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum,</hi> and the Juſtices of the Peace, are nominated by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and conſtituted by a Commiſſion under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> who hold their Seſſion both at <hi>Southwell</hi> and <hi>Scrooby,</hi> and perform all other Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Acts diſtinct from the County.</p>
            <p>The Church is a ſtrong plain <hi>Gothick</hi> Building; it has no painted Figures in the Glaſs Work, nor Images, nor ſo much as a Niche capable of placing an Image in. And from hence it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that it was probably built before Image-worſhip was practiſed among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the fifth of <hi>November</hi> 1711, about Ten a Clock at Night, the Top of the Ball on one of the South Spires of this Church was fired by Lightning; which, backed by a furious Wind, that drove it almoſt directly on the Body of the Church, in a few Hours burnt down the Spire and Roof, melted the Bells, and ſpared nothing which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible, except the other Spire, till it came to the Choir, where, after it had conſumed the Organs, it was by ſingular Providence ſtopt and extinguiſh'd. The Damage was computed at near Four thouſand Pounds.</p>
            <p>The Church is built in Form of a Croſs; a great Tower in the Middle, in which are eight Bells, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0141100403:64"/>
two Spires at the Weſt End. There is a handſome Chapter-houſe on the North Side of the Choir.</p>
            <p>The Length of the Church from Eaſt to Weſt is 306 Feet, the Length of the croſs Iſle from North to South is 121 Feet; the Breadth of the Church is 59 Feet.</p>
            <p>There are no very remarkable Monuments in this Church, except one of Archbiſhop <hi>Sands,</hi> which is within the Communion Rails, and is a fair Tomb of Alabaſter, with his Effigies lying on it at full Length, with a fine Inſcription upon it in <hi>Latin,</hi> greatly to his Honour; but which being very long, I have not Room to inſert.</p>
            <p>Here was formerly a Palace belonging to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> which ſtood on the South Side of the Church, the Ruins of which ſtill remain; by which it appears to have been a large and ſtately Building. It was demoliſhed in the Time of the late Civil Wars. The Church eſcaped the Fury of thoſe Times, by the good Offices of one <hi>Edward Cludd,</hi> Eſquire, one of the Parliament Side, who lived at <hi>Norwood,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Southwell,</hi> in a Houſe belonging to the Archbiſhop. Here were no leſs than three Parks belonging to the Archbiſhop, which, though diſparked, ſtill retain the Name; one of which is <hi>Norwood</hi> Park, in which is a good Houſe, which, has been very much inlarged and beautified by Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> a Deſcendant of the above <hi>Edward Cludd,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who lives in it ſome Part of the Year.</p>
            <p>There is a Free-ſchool adjoining to the Church, under the Care of the Chapter, where the Choir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters are taught <hi>gratis,</hi> and other Boys belonging to the Town. The Maſter is choſen by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and is to be approved by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo two Fellowſhips and two Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in St. <hi>John</hi>'s College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> founded by Dr. <hi>Keton,</hi> Canon of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> in the 22d Year of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0141100403:65"/>
King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to be choſen by the Maſter and Fellows of the ſaid College out of ſuch as have been Choiriſters of the Church of <hi>Southwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Southwell</hi> I turned to the Left to <hi>Newſted,</hi> to viſit the antient Seat of the very antient Family of the <hi>Byrons,</hi> who even in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Time were wealthy. It was a ſmall Priory founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> II. and given by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII to Sir <hi>John Byron</hi>; one of which Name having ſignalized himſelf very remarkably for his Loyalty to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. was created a Baron, which Honour ſtill continues in the Family. Near this Place is the Head of the little River <hi>Lin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We came next to <hi>Ainſley,</hi> which Town gave Name to a Family that were poſſeſſed of it from the Conqueſt to the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. from whence are deſcended the Earls of <hi>Angleſey:</hi> but for want of Heirs Male, it came then by Marriage into the Family of the <hi>Chaworths,</hi> who have a good Seat here, well wooded, and watered with beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fiſh-ponds.</p>
            <p>We then turned again on the Right to <hi>Mansfield,</hi> which lies in the Foreſt, a large well-built Market-town, noted now for its Trade in Malt, and for have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been formerly the Place, to which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> uſed to retire for the Pleaſure of Hunting in the Foreſt of <hi>Shirwood</hi>; inſomuch that a Manor was held in this County by <hi>Henry Fauconberg</hi> for Shoeing the King's Horſe, whenever he came to <hi>Mansfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we kept ſtill to the Right North-eaſt, and came to <hi>Taxford in the Clays,</hi> an ordinary, dirty Market-town on the great Road to <hi>York,</hi> and of no other Note, than being ſituated in a miry, clayey Country, and call'd by King <hi>James</hi> I. <hi>Taxford in the T—d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We kept the Road North to <hi>Eaſt Retford,</hi> ſo called as it lies on the Eaſt Side of the River <hi>Idle.</hi> It
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0141100403:66"/>
is an antient Bailiwick-town, and noted for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of all Tolls and foreign Services. It holds Pleas without Limitation of Sums, and enjoys many other valuable Privileges and Immunities. It has a Steward who is generally a Perſon of Quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weſt Retford</hi> is ſo call'd from its Situation in regard to the other, tho' they ſeem to be but one Town, the <hi>Idle</hi> only dividing them. This is famous for a fine Hoſpital, founded by Dr. <hi>Dorrel</hi> in 1666, and ſince incorporated. It has a Maſter, 10 Brethren, a Steward, and a Nurſe; and they have a Garden and Orchard divided into 10 Shares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chaworth</hi> is a Village juſt by, noted for a fine Rectory of 200<hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>Higher up ſtands <hi>Blith,</hi> which is a kind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town, where are a very large good Church, and ſome old Ruins of a Caſtle and a Priory.</p>
            <p>We then fell down Southward, and viſited the noble Seats of the Duke of <hi>Kingſton</hi> at <hi>Thoreſby,</hi> of the Lord <hi>Oxford</hi> at <hi>Welbeck,</hi> and of the late Marquis of <hi>Halifax,</hi> but now of Sir <hi>George Savil,</hi> at <hi>Rufford,</hi> or <hi>Rugford</hi> Abbey, all very magnificent Structures though antient, eſpecially that at <hi>Welbeck,</hi> which is beautified with large Additions, fine Apartments, and good Gardens; but particularly the Park, which is well ſtocked with large Timber of the fineſt Kind, and with great Numbers of Deer. For the late Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Delight (whoſe Property it was, before it came by Marriage into the <hi>Harley</hi> Family) being chiefly on Horſeback, and in the Chace, it is not to be wondered, if he rather made his Parks fine than his Gardens, and his Stables than his Manſion-houſe: yet the Houſe is noble, large, and magnificent.</p>
            <p>Hard by <hi>Welbeck,</hi> near the Head of the River <hi>Ryton,</hi> is <hi>Wirkſop Manor,</hi> the ſometime ſtately Seat of the noble Family of <hi>Talbot,</hi> deſcended by a long Line of Anceſtors from another Family illuſtrious,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0141100403:67"/>
though not innobled, of <hi>Lovetofts</hi>; one of whom being Lord of this Place under the <hi>Normans,</hi> built a Priory here: and <hi>John,</hi> the ſecond Earl of <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> being ſlain at the Battle of <hi>Northampton,</hi> 38 <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was buried in it; which afterwards, at the Diſſolution of Monaſteries, was ſettled on <hi>Francis,</hi> his Great Grandſon. This Houſe (though in its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Figure) is outdone by none of the beſt and greateſt in the County. It now belongs to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a good Market-town alſo, of the Name of <hi>Wirkſop,</hi> where are the Ruins of a Monaſtery to be ſeen in the Meadows on the Eaſt Side of it, and the Weſt End of the Church, which is ſtill ſtanding, and has Two beautiful and fair Towers. This Place is noted for Liquorice and Malt.</p>
            <p>From hence leaving <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> the Weſt Part of which abounds with Lead and Coal, we came to <hi>Balſover</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> which ſtands on a riſing Ground, and has a Caſtle, and is the Property of the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> but is no Market-town.</p>
            <p>From hence we intended to paſs directly to <hi>Derby</hi>; but being informed, that the Moors, by reaſon of the Rocks and Bogs which render the Roads difficult and hazardous, were too dangerous to travel over, we left them on the Weſt of us; and paſſing thro' <hi>Mansfield</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and <hi>Alfreton</hi> a ſmall Market-town within the Skirts of <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> we arriv'd at <hi>Derby</hi> the County-town. But tho' we avoided the Moors, yet we had ſome Reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Roads, which we took from the North of <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> where we were informed, that if we had come directly from <hi>Nottingham</hi> to this Town, and kept the Mid-way between the <hi>Trent</hi> on the Left, and the Mountains on the Right, we ſhould have found the 12 Miles, which lie between them, as agreeable with reſpect to the Situation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0141100403:68"/>
the Soil, and the well planting of it, as any of the ſame Length in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Derby</hi> is ſituate on the Weſt Bank of the <hi>Derwent,</hi> over which it has a very fine Stone Bridge, well-built, but antient, and a Chapel upon the Bridge, now converted into a Dwelling-houſe. It is a fine, beautiful, and pleaſant Town, and has more Families of Gentlemen in it, than is uſual in Towns ſo remote; perhaps the more, becauſe the <hi>Peak,</hi> which takes up the larger Part of the County, is ſo inhoſpitable, rugged, and wild a Place, that the Gentry chuſe to reſide at <hi>Derby,</hi> rather than upon their Eſtates, as they do elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Here is a Curioſity of a very extraordinary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the only one of the Kind in <hi>England:</hi> I mean thoſe Mills on the <hi>Derwent,</hi> which work the three capital <hi>Italian</hi> Engines for making Organzine or Thrown Silk, which, before theſe Mills were erected, was purchaſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants with ready Money in <hi>Italy</hi>; by which Invention one Hand will twiſt as much Silk, as before could be done by Fifty, and that in a much truer and better Manner. This Engine contains 26,586 Wheels, and 97,746 Movements, which work 73,726 Yards of Silk-thread, every time the Water-wheel goes round, which is three times in one Minute, and 318,504,960 Yards in one Day and Night. One Water-wheel gives Motion to all the reſt of the Wheels and Movements, of which any one may be ſtopt ſeparately. One Fire-engine, likewiſe, conveys warm Air to every individual Part of the Machine, and the whole Work is govern'd by one Regulator. The Houſe which contains this Engine is of a vaſt Bulk, and Five or Six Stories high.</p>
            <p>A Patent paſſed 5 <hi>George</hi> I. to ſecure to Sir <hi>Thomas Lombe</hi> the ſole Property of this Invention for 14 Years; but the requiſite Buildings and Engines, and the inſtructing of proper Perſons to work them, took
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0141100403:69"/>
up ſo much Time, and when all was completed, the King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> prohibiting the Importation of the Raw Silk made by the ſaid Engines, into his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, all which render'd the Undertaking expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and difficult, and the Term of 14 Years being near elapſed, without any great Benefit accruing from the uſeful Invention, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> apply'd for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration from the Publick; and the Parliament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, to preſerve ſo uſeful an Undertaking for the Benefit of the Kingdom in general, allotted 14000<hi>l.</hi> to be paid to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> on Condition that he ſhould allow a perfect Model to be taken of his new-invented Engines, in order to ſecure and perpetuate the Art of making the ſame. The Preamble to this Act ſets forth, That Sir <hi>Thomas Lombe</hi> did with the utmoſt Difficulty and Hazard, and at a very great Expence, diſcover the Art of making and working the Three Capital Engines made uſe of by the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> to make their Organzine Silk, and did intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Arts and Inventions into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>This wonderful Piece of Machinery was under the Direction of Sir <hi>Thomas Lombe,</hi> or, as ſome ſay, of his Brother, erected by one <hi>Soracole,</hi> a Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in making Mill-work, eſpecially for raiſing Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſupply Towns for Family Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Derby,</hi> as I have ſaid, is a Town of Gentry, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Trade; yet it is populous, well-built, has Five Pariſhes, a large Market-place, a beautiful Town-houſe of Free-ſtone, and very handſome Streets. But the Entrance into it every Way is ſo choaked up with Dirt and Mire, that it is no ſmall Matter of Reproach to the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>In the Church of <hi>All Saints</hi> is the Burial-place of the noble <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> Family; and an Hoſpital cloſe by the Church, built by one of that Family, for Eight poor Men, and Four Women.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0141100403:70"/>This Church is remarkable for the Architecture of its beautiful <hi>Gothick</hi> Tower, 178 Feet high; and for the Elegance of its Ornaments, as well as Height, is not to be equalled in this, or in any of the adjacent Counties.</p>
            <p>According to an Inſcription in this Church, the Steeple was erected about Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, at the Charge of the Maidens and Batchelors of the Town; on which Account, whenever a Maiden, a Native of the Town, was married, the Bells uſed to be rung by Batchelors. How long the Cuſtom laſted, I have not read; but I do not find it is now continued. This Union of the Maidens and Batchelors to build a Steeple, reminds me of a Bell caſt by a like Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, upon which was this Device,

                  <hi>Materiem Juvenes, Formam tribuere Puellae.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Government of this Town is in a Mayor, High Steward, 9 Aldermen, a Recorder, 14 Brothers, 14 Capital Burgeſſes, and a Town Clerk. What Trade there is in the Town is chiefly in good Malt and good Ale.</p>
            <p>Beyond <hi>Derby,</hi> along the <hi>Ricning Way,</hi> is <hi>Burton upon Trent,</hi> where is a Bridge of 37 Arches. Here was an old Abbey, out of whoſe Ruins they have within theſe few Years built a new Church.</p>
            <p>A Mile below <hi>Derby,</hi> upon the <hi>Derwent,</hi> ſtood the old <hi>Roman Derventio,</hi> now <hi>Little Cheſter.</hi> Remains of the old Walls, Vaults, Wells, <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, Aqueducts, Human Bones, Braſs Rings, and other Marks of Antiquity, have been from time to time diſcovered and dug up. The River being too rapid for a Ford, a Bridge was antiently there, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of which with a Staff they can ſtill feel.</p>
            <p>A little further North, is <hi>Horreſton</hi> Caſtle, whoſe Ruins on a hoary Rock, are ſcarce diſcernible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0141100403:71"/>It is obſervable, that as the <hi>Trent</hi> bounds the County of <hi>Derby</hi> South, ſo the <hi>Dove</hi> and the <hi>Erwaſh</hi> make the Bounds Eaſt and Weſt, and the <hi>Derwent</hi> runs thro' the Centre, all of them beginning and ending their Courſe in the ſame County; for they riſe in the <hi>Peak,</hi> and end in the <hi>Trent.</hi> The <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went</hi> is remarkable for its Brownneſs, the <hi>Dove</hi> for its blue Tranſparency, from whence it probably took its Name. It is endued with ſuch a peculiar Fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, ſuppoſed to ariſe from a Bed of Lime, thro' which it paſſes, that it has often been compared to the River <hi>Nile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not leſs ſwift in its Operations than effectual; for by haſty Rains, which fall from the Hills, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtrays over the Meadows, and having impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated them, in 12 Hours time retires into its Bed again.</p>
            <p>It was in one of theſe temporary Inundations I ſaw it, when having gone from <hi>Derby</hi> to <hi>Dowbridge,</hi> as it is called, I paſſed it with Difficulty to ſee Two Market-towns, <hi>Aſhbourn,</hi> and <hi>Utoxeter,</hi> the <hi>Utocetum</hi> of the Antients.</p>
            <p>The firſt lies on the Eaſt Side of the River in a very rich Soil to the North-weſt of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the other, commonly called <hi>Utceſter,</hi> is ſituate due Weſt of <hi>Derby,</hi> on the other Side of the River in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> upon a delicious riſing Ground of an eaſy Aſcent, and very fruitful, overlooking a Track of fine, rich Meadow-grounds. The Town is very ordinarily built, but has a good and commodious Market-place, and an excellent Market for all ſorts of living Kine, beſides Butter, Cheeſe, and Corn, and alſo all kinds of Proviſions.</p>
            <p>In our Way to the <hi>High Peak</hi> we paſſed an antient Seat, large, but not very gay, of Sir <hi>Nathanael Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> From hence we kept the <hi>Derwent</hi> on our Right-hand, which having overflowed its Banks, by the Acceſſion of Floods pouring down from the <hi>Peak</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0141100403:72"/>
               <hi>Hills,</hi> render'd it ſo frightful, that we contented our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hearing at a Diſtance its ſhocking Roar; and ſo came to <hi>Quarn,</hi> or <hi>Quarnden,</hi> a little ragged, but noted Village, where is a famous Chalybeat Spring, to which abundance of People reſort in the Seaſon to drink the Water; as likewiſe a Cold Bath. There are alſo ſeveral other Mineral Waters in this Part of the Country, a hot Bath at <hi>Matlock,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at <hi>Buxton,</hi> of which in their Places. Beſides theſe, there are hot Springs in ſeveral Places which run waſte into the Ditches and Brooks, and are taken no notice of, being remote among the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and out of the Way of common Reſort.</p>
            <p>We found the Wells at <hi>Quarn</hi> pretty full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the Waters good, and very phyſical, but wretched Lodging and Entertainment.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Quarnden</hi> we advanced due North, and mounting the Hills gradually for Four or Five Miles, we ſoon had a moſt diſmal View of the black Mountains of the <hi>Peak</hi>; however, as they were at a Diſtance, and a good Town lay on our Left, called <hi>Wirkſworth,</hi> we turned thither for Refreſhment. Here we found verify'd what I had often heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that however dreary the Hills might appear, the Vales were every-where fruitful and delightful to the Eye, alſo well-inhabited, and having in them good Market-towns, abounding with all neceſſary Proviſions; and as for the Ale, the further we went Northward, the better it ſeemed to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wirkſworth</hi> is a large well-frequented Market-town; tho' there is no very great Trade carry'd on in it, but what relates to the Lead-works.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peakrills,</hi> as they are called, are a rude booriſh kind of People; but bold, daring, and even deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their Search into the Bowels of the Earth: for which Reaſon they are often imployed by our Engineers in the Wars to carry on the <hi>Sap,</hi> when they lay Siege to ſtrong fortified Places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0141100403:73"/>The <hi>Barmoot Court,</hi> kept at <hi>Wirkſworth,</hi> to judge Controverſies among the Miners, and adjuſt ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Quarrels and Diſputes, is very remarkable. It conſiſts of a Maſter and 24 Jurors, who, when any Perſon has found a Vein of Ore in another's Land, (except it be in Orchards or Gardens) aſſign two Meres of Ground in a <hi>Pipe</hi> (as they term it) and a <hi>Flat,</hi> the former being 29 Yards long, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 14 Yards Square, appointing to the Finder one Mere, and the other to the Owner of the Land, half at each End of the Finder's; and moreover, certain Fees and Perquiſites for the Paſſage of Carts, the Uſe of Timber, and the like. This Court not only preſcribes Rules to the Miners, and limits their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Works under-ground, but is Judge of all their little Quarrels above.</p>
            <p>The Produce of the Mines in this Hundred is very conſiderable: the King claims the 13th Peny Duty, for which they compound at the Rate of 1000<hi>l.</hi> a Year; nay, I have been informed, that the Tythe of <hi>Wirkſworth</hi> alone has been worth to the Incumbent yearly that Sum.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence lies <hi>Hartington,</hi> which gives Title of Marquis to the eldeſt Son of the Duke of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near <hi>Wirkſworth,</hi> and upon the very Edge of <hi>Derwent,</hi> is a Village called <hi>Matlock,</hi> where, as I ſaid, are ſeveral warm Springs. One of theſe is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a Stone Wall on every Side, by which the Water is brought to riſe to a due Height; and if it is too high, there is a Sluice to let it out as low as you pleaſe. It has a Houſe built over it, and room within the Building to walk round the Bath, and ſo by Steps go down gradually into it. The Water is but juſt Milk-warm, ſo that it is no leſs pleaſant to go into, than ſanative.</p>
            <p>This Bath would be much more frequented than it is, if a ſad, ſtony, mountainous Road, which leads
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0141100403:74"/>
to it, and no good Accommodation when you are there, did not hinder; for from the Bath you are to croſs over the Meadows, and then aſcend a <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Hill, before you meet with a Houſe of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For ſome Miles before you come to <hi>Matlock,</hi> you paſs over barren Moors in perpetual Danger of ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into Coal-pits and Lead-mines, or ride for Miles together on the Edge of a ſteep Hill on ſolid ſlippery Rock, or looſe Stones, with a Valley underneath, the Bottom of which you can hardly diſcover with your Eye. Inſtead of Trees and Hedges, they fence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their poor Meadow for Arable, with Walls made of looſe Stones, pick'd from under their Feet. The extended Sides of the Mountains are generally pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd over, as it were, with Rocks, Streams of Water dribbling down every where, and ſometimes bolder Cataracts diverſify the romantick Scene.</p>
            <p>At the Smelting-mills, they melt down the Lead Ore, and run it into a Mold, whence it becomes <hi>Pigs,</hi> as they call them. The Bellows are kept in continual Motion by running Water. We were complimented to be let down 200 Yards deep into the Mines, if we pleas'd. Over-againſt this warm Bath, and on the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Derwent,</hi> we came to a monſtrous Parcel of gigantick Rocks, ſeemingly pil'd on one another, called the <hi>Torr.</hi> A few Inhabitants in little Cottages truſted themſelves at Bottom, under ſo ruinous a Shelter. I took the Pains on Hands and Knees to clamber near the Top, and enter'd an Hermit's Cell hewn in the Rock, with a moſt dreary Proſpect before it. On one End is a Crucifix and a little Nich, where I ſuppoſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorite plac'd his Saint. Over-againſt it, about half a Mile off, is ſuch another Cliff, but by the Care of a Gentleman who lives underneath, Mr. <hi>Aſhe,</hi> is hewn out of the Rock an eaſy Aſcent by Steps, and there are abundance of Alcoves, Grotts, Summer-houſes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0141100403:75"/>
Cellars, Pinacles, Dials, Baluſtrades, Urns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of the ſame Materials. And by the Help of Earth carry'd up to the Top, there are fine Graſs Walks, with Greens planted along them upon this hanging Terrace; whence you have a fine View over many a craggy Mountain.</p>
            <p>A little on the other Side of <hi>Wirkſworth</hi> begins a long Plain, called <hi>Braſſington Moor,</hi> which reaches from <hi>Braſſington</hi> to <hi>Buxton,</hi> full 12 Miles: from <hi>Wirkſworth</hi> it is not quite ſo much. The <hi>Peak</hi> People, who are mighty fond of raiſing the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Strangers, told us here of another high Mountain, where a Giant was buried, which they called the <hi>Giant's Tomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We rode up the Hill, which ſeem'd to be round, with a Precipice almoſt on every Side of it. While we were in queſt of the Tomb of the Dead, we found the Rock afforded an Habitation for a poor Woman and her Children. We entered into their Manſion, divided by a Curtain into its ſeveral Offices, and a Funnel work'd thro' the Top to carry the Smoke out, where the celebrated Tombſtone was. Her Huſband, ſhe ſaid, was a Miner, who, if he had good Luck, could earn his Five Pence, and ſhe could alſo earn her Three Pence a Day, were it not for the Care of ſo many Children; but, ſhe bleſſed God, they lived very comfortably. An Inſtance of that happy Contentment oftener met with in Habitations like this, than in gilded Palaces!</p>
            <p>We went next, by the Direction of the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to a Valley on the Side of a riſing Hill, where were ſeveral Grooves (for ſo they call the Mouth of the Shaft, or Pit, by which they go down into a Lead Mine). As we were ſtanding ſtill to look at one of them, admiring how ſmall they were, and ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a poor Man, who told us they went down thoſe narrow Holes to a great Depth in the Earth, we were ſurpriſed with ſeeing a Hand, and then an
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0141100403:76"/>
Arm, and quickly after a Head, thruſt up out of the very Groove we were looking at.</p>
            <p>Immediately we rode cloſer up to the Place, where we ſaw the poor Wretch working and heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf up gradually, as we thought, with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but when he ſhewed us that it was by ſetting his Feet and Elbows upon Pieces of Wood fixt croſs the Angles of the Groove like a Ladder, we found the Difficulty was not much, and that if the Groove had been larger, he could not go up and down with ſo much Eaſe or Safety.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who would have a more perfect Idea of thoſe Grooves, need only ſee the ſquare Wells in the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by which the Workmen go down from the Top of the Church into the very Vaults under it, to place the Leaden Pipes, which carry the Rain Water from the Flat of the Roof to the Common-ſewer. They have ſmall Iron Bars placed croſs the Angles for the Men to ſet their Feet on, in the manner here repreſented. <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>When this ſubterranean Creature was come quite out, with all his Furniture about him, he afforded us new matter of Wonder, which ſatisfy'd our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity without venturing down ourſelves. For the Man was a moſt uncouth Spectacle; he was cloathed all in Leather, had a Cap of the ſame without Brims, ſome Tools in a little Baſket, which he drew up with him, not one of the Names of which we could underſtand, but by the Help of an Interpreter. Nor indeed could we underſtand any of the Man's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo as to make out a whole Sentence, and yet he was pretty free of his Tongue too. He was lean as a Skeleton, pale as a dead Corps, his Hair and Beard a deep black; what little Fleſh he had, was lank, and, as we thought, ſomething of the Colour of the Lead itſelf. Beſides his Baſket of Tools, he brought up with him about three Quarters of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0141100403:77"/>
Weight of Ore, which was no ſmall Load, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Manner of his coming up; and it was this which occaſioned that Heaving and Struggling at his firſt Appearance; and it ſeems he was at work 60 Fathoms deep, but that there were five Men of his Party, two of whom were 11 Fathoms, and the other three 15 Fathoms deeper. The Man ſeemed to regret, that he was not at work with theſe three; for they had a Way out at the Side of the Hill, without coming up ſo high as he was obliged to do. We then looked on the Ore, and got the poor Man's Leave to bring every one a ſmall Piece of it away with us, for which we gave him two Pieces of better Metal.</p>
            <p>From hence entering upon <hi>Braſſington Moor,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, we had eight Miles ſmooth Green Riding to <hi>Buxton</hi> Bath, which they call <hi>One</hi> of the Seven Wonders of the <hi>Peak,</hi> compriſed in that noted Verſe of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
               <q>

            </p>
            <p>This Place has ſome Advantages beyond what the City of <hi>Bath</hi> can pretend to. Here is an open and healthy Country, a Variety of fine Views to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Curious, and a beautiful Down for the Ladies to take the Air in, much more agreeable than the cloſe City of <hi>Bath,</hi> which is very deficient in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>And as to the Medicinal Nature of the Waters at <hi>Buxton,</hi> hear what Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſays of their Virtues, and the Manner of their Operation, in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory of</hi> Lancaſhire, <hi>and of the</hi> Peak. His Words are as follow: <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0141100403:78"/>
                  <p>"The Waters are Sulphurous and Saline, yet not fetid, but very palatable, becauſe the Sulphur is not united with any Vitriolic Particles, or but very few Saline; it tinges not Silver, nor is it Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, becauſe its Saline Parts are diſpenſed in ſuch ſmall Proportions.</p>
                  <p>"If drank, they create a good Appetite, open Obſtructions, and no doubt, if mixed with the Chalybeat Waters that are there alſo, may anſwer all the Intentions of the <hi>Bath</hi> Water in <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s too at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſo noted for curing the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> of which I have ſeen ſeveral Inſtances in theſe Parts; and likewiſe for curing of Bloody Urines, of which I ſaw a moſt noted Inſtance at <hi>Liverpool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"This Bath is of a temperate Heat, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, by a reverberating <hi>Halitus</hi> might be brought to any Degree of Heat; but, I think, in its own natural Heat, it may in general be ſaid to be more agreeable to the Conſtitution; and where the hot Baths cannot be ſafely uſed, this may. This laſt Summer I ſaw remarkable Inſtances of its Effects in ſcorbutick Rheumatiſms in Perſons, that could not go before without the Help of Crutches, who came from thence to <hi>Mancheſter</hi> on Foot without them, diſtant from <hi>Buxton</hi> full 16 Northern Miles."</p>

            <p>The Village where the principal Springs are, is called <hi>Buxton,</hi> tho' there are ſeveral of them; for they riſe unregarded in the Banks of the Incloſures, and on the Sides of the Hill, ſo that their Number is hardly known.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> Lord of the Village, has built a large and convenient Houſe for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Strangers. The Bath-room is arched over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the Whole made handſome, convenient, and delightful. This Collection of tepid Waters, exceeding clear, will receive 20 People at a time to walk and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0141100403:79"/>
ſwim in. The Temper of the Water is equal to new Milk, or Blood-warm, procuring a moderate Perſpiration. Its Effect is remarkable for giving that gentle Relaxation of the Solids; which takes off the Wearineſs and Fatigue of a Journey, and refreſhes inſtantly. 'Tis phyſically uſeful in many Caſes, and may be indulg'd in more, than the Hot-baths of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> which frequently do Harm thro' impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Uſe. Such a one as this naturally is, was aimed at by the ſumptuous Bagnio's of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Delves,</hi> who received a Cure here, gave the Pump, and a pretty Stone Alcove over the Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſpring in the Yard. The Water may be raiſed at pleaſure to any Height. We found in one of the Rooms theſe Verſes written upon the Wall by a Phyſician who formerly frequented the Place:

            <p>About half a Mile off is that ſtupendous Cavern, called <hi>Poole's-hole,</hi> at the Foot of a great Mountain, and deemed the <hi>Second</hi> Wonder of the <hi>Peak.</hi> The Entrance is ſo low and narrow, that you muſt ſtoop to get in; but immediately it dilates into a wide and lofty Concavity, which reaches above a Quarter of a Mile end-wiſe, and farther, as they ſay. Some old Women with lighted Candles are Guides in this dark Way. Water drops every-where from the Roof, and incruſts all the Stones with long Cryſtals and Fluors, whence a thouſand imaginary Figures are ſhewn you by the Name of Lions, Fonts, Lanterns, Organs, Flitch of Bacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At length you come to the Queen of <hi>Scots Pillar,</hi> as the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of moſt Peoples Curioſity. It was ſo named by that unhappy Princeſs, when ſhe viſited this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0141100403:81"/>
Place: Nor needed ſhe any other Monument; for, by this Incident, ſhe may be ſaid to have erected one to her Memory, which will probably laſt as long as the Works of Nature; tho' every one almoſt that comes hither, carries away a Piece of it, in Memory of the Princeſs, or the Place. It is a clear bright Stone like Alabaſter, or rather like that kind of Spar, which is found about Lead; and conſidering the Country where it grows, is probably ſomething of that Sort.</p>
            <p>A Stream of Water runs along the Middle, among the falling Rocks, with a hideous Noiſe, re-echo'd from all Sides of the horrid Concave. On the Left-hand is a Sort of Chamber, where they ſay <hi>Poole,</hi> a famous Robber, lived, and whoſe Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, as well as Bed-chamber, they ſhew you, after you have crept 10 Yards on all Fours.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſurpriſing Thing you meet with in it, is the extraordinary Height of the Arch, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is far from what a late Author has magnified it to, a Quarter of a Mile perpendicular. Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſpends ſome Time in admiring the ſpangled Roof. <hi>Cotton</hi> and <hi>Hobbes</hi> are exceedingly witty upon it. Dr. <hi>Leigh</hi> calls it <hi>Fret-work, Organ,</hi> and <hi>Choir-work.</hi> The Whole of the Matter is this: The Rock being every-where moiſt and dropping, ſome of the Drops are fallen, which you ſee below; ſome are falling, and others are pendent in the Roof. Now, as you have Guides before you and behind, carrying every one a Candle, the Light of the Candles, reflected by the globular Drops of Water, dazle your Eyes like the Dew in a Sun-ſhine Morning; whereas, were any Part of the Arch of this Vault to be ſeen by a clear Light, all this Beauty would diſappear.</p>
            <p>Let any Perſon therefore, who goes into <hi>Poole's Hole,</hi> and has a Mind to make the Experiment, take a long Pole in his Hand, with a Cloth tied to the End of it, and wipe the Drops of Water away, he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0141100403:82"/>
will at once extinguiſh all thoſe Glories. Then let him wait till other Drops emerge, and he will find the Stars and Spangles glittering as before.</p>
            <p>As to the ſeveral Stones, called <hi>Cotton's Stone, Haycock's Stone, Poole's Chair, Flitch of Bacon,</hi> and the like, they do not enough reſemble what they are ſaid to repreſent, as to be the Foundation of even a Poetick Metamorphoſis.</p>
            <p>The petrifying Water indeed might have exerciſed <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Fancy: for you ſee Drops pendent like Icicles, or riſing up like Pyramids, and hardening into Stone, juſt the Reverſe of what the Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes of Stones being ſoften'd into Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Wonder of the <hi>Peak</hi> is <hi>Mam Tor,</hi> or, as the Word in the Mountain Jargon, or rather in the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> ſignifies, the <hi>Mother Rock,</hi> (for <hi>Mam</hi> is the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word for Mother) upon a Suggeſtion, that the ſoft crumbling Earth, which falls from its Summit, produces ſeveral other Mountains below. The Whole of the Wonder is this: On the South Side of this Hill is a Precipice, very ſteep from the Top to the Bottom; and the Subſtance being of a crumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling looſe Earth mingled with ſmall Stones, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually falling down in ſmall Quantities, as the heavy Rains looſen and waſh it off, or as Froſts and Thaws operate upon it. Now, the great Hill, which is thick, as well as high, parts with this looſe Stuff, without being ſenſibly diminiſhed; ſo the Bottom, into which it falls, being narrow, is more eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ſwell. Here then is the pretended Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That the little Heap below ſhould grow up into a Hill, without any Decreaſe of the great Hill, as it ſhould ſeem, notwithſtanding ſo much has fallen from it. But the Fact is certainly otherwiſe, tho' not perceivable.</p>
            <p>This Hill lies on the North Side of the Road from <hi>Buxton</hi> to <hi>Caſtleton,</hi> at which Place you come to the <hi>Fourth</hi> much famed Wonder, ſtyled <hi>The Devil's</hi>

               <hi>Arſe in the Peak.</hi> The ſhort Account of it is this: On the ſteep Side of a Mountain is a large Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, almoſt in the Form of an old <hi>Gothick</hi> Arch, from its Centre, only that the Entrance is horizontal. It is upwards of 30 Feet perpendicular, and twice as much broad at the Bottom at leaſt.</p>
            <p>It continues thus wide but a little Way, yet far enough to have ſeveral ſmall Cottages built on either Side of it within the Entrance, like a little Town in a Vault. In the Middle, as it were, of the Street, is a running Stream of Water: in poetical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions it is called a River, tho' not the River <hi>Styx.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As you go on, the Roof deſcends gradually, and is now ſo far from having Houſes, that a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand upright in it till ſtooping for a little Way, and paſſing over another Rill of Water, likewiſe called a River, you find more Room over your Head. But going a little farther, you come to a third Water, which croſſes your Way; and the Rock ſtooping, as it were, down almoſt to the Surface of the Water, puts an End to the Traveller's Search.</p>
            <p>But when we read in Scripture, that the Caves of <hi>Adullam</hi> and <hi>Macpelah</hi> were able to receive <hi>David</hi> and his Troop of 400 Men, and what Travellers relate of a Cave in the <hi>Apennine</hi> Mountains, near <hi>Florence,</hi> large enough to contain an Army; and when we know, that there are many others in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and the Hills of <hi>Dauphiné</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and other Parts of the World; this ſurely can be thought no Wonder, unleſs we credit <hi>Gervaiſe</hi> of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> who tells us of a Shepherd, that ventured into the third River in this Den, and being either carried over it, or down the Stream, he knew not whether, ſaw a beautiful heavenly Country beyond it, with a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Plain, watered with many clear Rivers, pleaſant Brooks, and ſeveral Lakes of ſtanding Water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0141100403:84"/>
               <hi>Caſtleton</hi> takes its Name from the Caſtle that lies near it, which is a very antient Building, and ſo ſituated as to be only one Way acceſſible, being erected on an high ſteep Rock; and the Way, that goes to it, is ſo full of Twinings and Turnings, that it is Two Miles from the Bottom to the Top.</p>
            <p>Not far off is a little Village called <hi>Burgh,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by the <hi>Romans,</hi> on account of the Baths, as appears evidently by a Cauſway leading from hence thither.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Wonder is called <hi>Tideſwell,</hi> or <hi>Weeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> a Spring which, according to ſome Writers, ebbs and flows, as the Sea does. The Baſin, or Receiver for the Water, is about Three Foot Square; the Water ſeems to have ſome other Receiver with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Rock, which, when it fills by the Force of the original Stream, the Air being contracted, or pent in, forces the Water out with a bubbling Noiſe, and ſo fills the Receiver without; but when the Force is ſpent within, then it ſtops till the Place is filled again; and, in the mean time, the Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out runs off, till the Quantity within ſwells again, and then the ſame Cauſe produces the ſame Effect. So that this <hi>Oceanet,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> calls it, which has been the Subject of ſeveral Philoſophick Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is owing wholly to the Figure of the Place, and is only a mere Accident in Nature; and if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were to dig into the narrow Cavities, and give vent to the Air, which is pent up within, they would ſoon ſee <hi>Tideſwell</hi> turned into an ordinary Stream.</p>
            <p>This Spring lies near the little Market-town of <hi>Tiddeſwall,</hi> wherein are a very good Church, and a Free-ſchool.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Five fictitious</hi> Wonders: I come now to the <hi>Two</hi> real Wonders, <hi>Elden Hole,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Devonſhire</hi>'s fine Houſe at <hi>Chatſworth</hi>; the one natural, the other artificial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0141100403:85"/>In the Middle of a plain open Field, gently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the South, is this frightful Chaſm in the Earth, or rather in the Rock, called <hi>Elden Hole.</hi> The Mouth of it is about 20 Feet over one Way, and 50 or 60 the other, deſcending down perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Earth; how deep, could never yet be diſcovered, notwithſtanding ſeveral Attempts have been made to find its Bottom. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſays, he let down 800 Fathom of Line, which is 1600 Yards, near a Mile perpendicular.</p>
            <p>The Author has poetically enough deſcribed the Noiſe the huge maſſy Stones make, which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People often throw down here. The Hiſſing of Spears and Arrows is ſeldom omitted in Poetry to deſcribe the Terror they bring: he has here improved a ſimilar Noiſe into a Mark of Fear.<q>

            <p>They tell a diſmal Story here of a Traveller, who inquiring his Way to <hi>Caſtleton,</hi> or to <hi>Buxton,</hi> in a dark Night, two Villains offered to guide him; but, intending to rob him, led him to the Edge of this Gulph, and either thruſt him in, or made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was a little Gull of Water, and bad him take a large Step, which he did into this Abyſs, and into that of Eternity at the ſame time.

Villains, being hanged at <hi>Derby</hi> ſome Years after for ſome other Roguery, confeſſed this diabolical Action at the Gallows.</p>
            <p>It raiſes an Horror in the Imagination, when one does but look into this frightful Hole; and ſo I ſhall leave it with the Words of the forementioned Author, who, ſuppoſing it one of the Entrances to the Infernal World, ſays,

            <p>I come now to the magnificent Seat of the Earls and Dukes of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> called <hi>Chatſworth-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This glorious Fabrick may be ſaid to have had two or three different Founders, who have all improved upon one another, in the Completion of this great Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Houſe was begun on a much narrower Plan than it now takes up, by Sir <hi>William Cavendiſh</hi> of <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who by Marriage with the Counteſs Dowager of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> became intitled to a noble Fortune in this Country.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> died, after having done little more than build one End of the Fabrick, and lay out the Plan of the Whole. But his Lady finiſhed it in the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent manner which it appeared in, when it was was firſt ranked among the Wonders of the <hi>Peak.</hi> And if it deſerved to be ſo ranked then, how much more does it now, with the additional Improvements made by the firſt Duke of <hi>Devonſhire!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Thing is obſervable, That the very Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Situation contribute to the Beauty of the Place, and, by the moſt exquiſite Management, are made ſubſervient to the Builder's Deſign. On the Eaſt Side, not far diſtant, riſes a prodigious high
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0141100403:87"/>
Mountain, which is ſo thick planted with beautiful Trees, that you only ſee a riſing Wood gradually aſcending, as if the Trees crouded one above the other to admire the ſtately Pile before them.</p>
            <p>Upon the Top of this Mountain they dig Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones; and here begins a vaſt extended Moor, which for 15 or 16 Miles together due North, has neither Hedge, Houſe, or Tree, but a waſte and houling Wilderneſs, over which, when Strangers travel, 'tis impoſſible to find their Way without Guides.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more ſurpriſing of its Kind, to a Traveller, who comes from the North, when, after a tedious Progreſs thro' ſuch a diſmal Deſart, on a ſudden the Guide brings him to this Precipice, where he looks down from a comfortleſs, barren, and, as he thought, endleſs Moor, into the moſt delightful Valley, and ſees a beautiful Palace, adorn'd with fine Gardens. If Contraries illuſtrate each other, here they are ſeen in the ſtrongeſt Oppoſition. It is really ſurpriſing to think what a Genius it muſt be, that ſhould lay out ſo great a Deſign in ſuch a Place, where the Mountains intercept the Clouds, and threaten, were Earthquakes frequent here, to bury whole Towns, and, what ſeems equal to a Town, this Houſe, in their Ruins.</p>
            <p>On the Plain, which extends from the Top of this Mountain, is a large Body of Water, which takes up near 30 Acres, and, from the Aſcents round it, receives, as into a Ciſtern, all the Water that falls; which, thro' Pipes, ſupplies the Caſcades, Waterworks, Ponds, and Canals, in the Gardens.</p>
            <p>Before the Weſt Front of the Houſe, which is the moſt beautiful, and where the firſt Foundreſs built a very auguſt Portal, runs the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> which, tho' not many Miles here from its Source, yet is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid River, when, by haſty Rains, or the melting of Snows, the Hills pour down their Waters into its Chanel; for the Current, by reaſon of its many
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0141100403:88"/>
contracted Paſſages among the Rocks, (Pieces of which, of an incredible Bulk, come ſometimes roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down its Stream) on the leaſt Motion of its Waters, above their ordinary Height, roars like the Breaches on the Shores of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Over this River is a ſtately Stone Bridge, with an antient Tower upon it, and in an Iſland in the River an antient Fabrick all of Stone, and built like a Caſtle; which are the Works of the ſaid Foundreſs, and ſhew the Greatneſs of the original Deſign; but are all, except the Bridge, eclipſed, as it were, by the modern Glories of the late Edifice.</p>
            <p>The Front to the Garden is a regular Piece of Architecture. The Frize under the Cornice has the Motto of the Family upon it in gilt Letters, ſo large as to take up the whole Front, tho' the Words are theſe two, CAVENDO TVTVS; which is no leſs applicable to the Situation of the Houſe, than the Name of the Family.</p>
            <p>The Saſhes of the ſecond Story, we were told, are 17 Feet high, of poliſhed Looking-glaſs, two Feet wide; and the Wood-work double-gilt.</p>
            <p>Under this Front lie the Gardens exquiſitely fine; and, to make a clear Viſta or Proſpect beyond into the flat Country, towards <hi>Hardwick,</hi> another Seat of the ſame Owner, the Duke (to whom thoſe Things which others thought impoſſible, were practicable) removed a great Mountain that ſtood in the Way, and which interrupted the Proſpect.</p>
            <p>In the uſual Approach to this noble Fabrick, it preſents itſelf thus: Firſt, the River, which in calm Weather glides gently by; then a venerable Walk of Trees, where the famous <hi>Hobbes</hi> uſed often to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template; a noble Piece of Iron-work Gates and Baluſters, expoſe the Front of the Houſe and Court, terminated at the Corners next the Road with two large Stone Pedeſtals of <hi>Attick</hi> Work, curiouſly adorned with Trophies of War, and Utenſils of all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0141100403:89"/>
the Sciences, in <hi>Baſſo Relievo.</hi> This Part of the Building is <hi>Ionick,</hi> the Whole being a Square of a ſingle Order, but every Side of a different Model: a Court in the Middle with a Piazza of <hi>Dorick</hi> Columns of one Stone each, overlaid with prodigious Architraves. The Stone is of an excellent Sort, veined like Marble, hewn out of the neighbouring Quarries, and tumbled down the adjacent Hill. In the Ante-room to the Hall are flat Stones of 14 Feet ſquare, laid upon the Heads of Four Pillars, and ſo throughout. In the Hall-ſtairs the Landing-ſteps are of the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions; the Doors, Chimneys, Window-caſes, Stairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of Marble; the Ceilings and Walls of all the Apartments charged with rare Painting of <hi>Varrio,</hi> and other famous Hands; the Bath-room, all of Marble curiouſly wrought.</p>
            <p>The Chapel is a moſt raviſhing Place; the Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end and Floor, Marble; the Seats and Gallery, Cedar; the reſt of the Wall and Ceiling, painted.</p>
            <p>The Gardens abound with Green-houſes, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-houſes, Walks, Wilderneſſes, Orangeries, with all the proper Furniture of Statues, Urns, Greens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Canals, Baſons, and Water-works of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Forms and Contrivance; as Sea-horſes, Drakes, Dolphins, and other Fountains, that throw up the Water. An artificial Willow-tree of Copper ſpouts dropping Water from every Leaf. A wonderful Caſcade, where from a neat Houſe of Stone, like a Temple, out of the Mouths of Beaſts, Pipes, Urns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a whole River deſcends, the Slope of a Hill a Quarter of a Mile in Length, over Steps, with a terrible Noiſe, and broken Appearance, till it is loſt under-ground. Beyond the Garden, upon the Hills, is a Park, and that over-look'd by a very high and rocky Mountain. Here are ſome Statues, and other Antiquities.</p>
            <p>I ſhould never have done, were I to ſay all that might be ſaid of this auguſt Palace. But two hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0141100403:90"/>
Circumſtances in its Honour muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom we had occaſion to mention as a Viſitant of the <hi>Peak,</hi> was for 17 Years in Cuſtody in this Houſe, under the Care of the celebrated Foundreſs of it. In Memory of this Royal Captive, the new Lodgings, that are built inſtead of the old, are ſtill called the <hi>Queen's of</hi> Scots <hi>Apartment.</hi> Happy for her, could ſhe have been allow'd to have paid the ſame fine Compliment to the Owner of it, which the Count <hi>de Tallard</hi> did, and is our other hiſtorical Circumſtance, when he had been entertained for a few Days by the late Duke of <hi>Devonſhire: When I return,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>into my own Country, and reckon up the Days of my Captivity, I ſhall leave out thoſe I ſpent at</hi> Chatſworth.</p>
            <p>I will cloſe all I have to ſay of this famous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, as I may call it, with the following brief Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Letter of an ingenious Gentleman to his Friend: <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <p>"This Place, <hi>ſays he,</hi> exceeds all the high Ideas and Deſcriptions that were ever given me of it. The Houſe yields to nothing in <hi>Europe</hi>; it is prodigiouſly great in every Part. I never ſaw ſuch a Number of fine Rooms; but the Situation ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all. Nature has laid herſelf out, in amazing Variety of Greatneſs and Proſpects; a fine River below, with fine Banks, ſome naked and rocky, others declining and woody, many ſmooth, and proper for Walking; large Groves and Fiſhponds, and Canals between the River and the Houſe, which riſes proudly upon ſeveral Terraces, and has behind it a great Lawn, intermixed with Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and great Walks, all riſing one above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, at firſt gently, afterwards over vaſt Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, to the Top of a high Mountain, which was all covered upon the Brows with high Trees, two or three Miles on either Side; then breaks into a thouſand Vales, and green Hills; then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0141100403:91"/>
its former Height and Bulk, proceeds again a mighty Mountain, covered with Rocks and Heath; its Sides in many Places adorned with Wood; the Whole yielding a moſt extenſive Proſpect of many Miles. Every body has heard of the great Caſcade."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There are likewiſe other Curioſities in the <hi>Peak</hi> which I need but juſt mention; as the Tottering Stones at <hi>Byrch Over,</hi> ſtanding upon a hard Rock, one of them ſaid to be four Yards high, 12 round, and yet reſts upon a Point ſo equally poiſed, that it may be moved with a Finger; the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, called <hi>Bath-gate</hi>; the ſeveral Minerals found in the Hills, and in the Lead Mines, as Black Lead, <hi>Stibium,</hi> or Antimony, and Cryſtal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bakewell</hi> is the beſt Town in the North-weſt Side of the <hi>Peak:</hi> it lies on the Banks of the <hi>Wye,</hi> and has a good Market; the Pariſh is exempt from Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Juriſdiction. Near this the Duke of <hi>Rutland</hi> has a very noble Palace, called <hi>Haddon,</hi> now intirely uninhabited. It was antiently the Seat of the <hi>Vernons,</hi> ſome of whom were Members of Parliament for this County as early as <hi>Edward</hi> III. Sir <hi>George Vernon,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, was ſtyled King of the <hi>Peak,</hi> and his Daughter being married to <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Son of the firſt Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> it came into the Family of the <hi>Manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The extended Angle of this County, which runs a great way North-weſt by <hi>Chappel</hi> in the <hi>Frith,</hi> (which was formerly a Market-town) and which they call <hi>High Peak,</hi> is perhaps the moſt deſolate, wild, and abandoned Country in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The Mountains of the <hi>Peak,</hi> of which I have been ſpeaking, ſeem to be but the Beginning of Wonders to this Part of the Country; the Tops of whoſe Hills ſeem to be as much above the Clouds, as the Clouds are above the ordinary Hills.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0141100403:92"/>Nor is this all; the Countenance of theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is ſuch, that they have no Bounds to them but the Sea; they run on in a continued Ridge from one to another, even to the Highlands in <hi>Scotland</hi>; ſo that they may be ſaid to divide <hi>Britain,</hi> as the <hi>Apennine</hi> Mountains divide <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus joining to <hi>Blackſtone Edge,</hi> they divide <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> from <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and going on North, divide the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> from <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and ſo on. All the Rivers in the North of <hi>England</hi> take their Riſe from them; thoſe on the Eaſt Side run into the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, thoſe on the Weſt Side into the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> for inſtance, the <hi>Dove</hi> and the <hi>Derwent</hi> riſe both at the South End of them, and come away South to the <hi>Trent</hi>; but all the Rivers afterwards run, as above, Eaſt or Weſt; and firſt, the <hi>Merſee</hi> riſes on the Weſt Side, and the <hi>Dun</hi> on the Eaſt; the firſt runs to <hi>Warrington</hi>; and into the Sea at <hi>Liverpoole</hi>; the other to <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and into the Sea at <hi>Humber.</hi> I ſhall confirm this Obſervation as I go on; for to give an Account of Rivers is the beſt Guide to the Geography of a Country. But to return to my Progreſs:</p>
            <p>We went next to <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> a handſome popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Town, ſituate between Rivulets, on the South Side of a Hill, North-eaſt from <hi>Chatſworth,</hi> well built and well inhabited, notwithſtanding it ſtands in the Extremity of this rocky Country; for being on the North Side of the County next to <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> it leads into the Hundred of <hi>Scarſdale,</hi> which is a rich fertile Part of the Country, tho' ſurrounded with barren Moors and Mountains, for ſuch the Name <hi>Scarſdale</hi> ſignifies. It is a Mayor-town of great Antiquity, and was made a free Borough by King <hi>John.</hi> It is now a Place of conſiderable Merchandice and Dealings in Lead, Grocery, Mercery, Melting of Barley, Tanning, Stockens, Blankets, Bedding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which they have great Intercourſe to and

            <p>We are now entered into the County of <hi>York,</hi> which is of larger Extent than any two Counties in <hi>England</hi> joined together, being in Compaſs 360 Miles. Its Figure is a large Square, and is adequate to the Dukedom of <hi>Wirtemburgh</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and contains more Ground than all the Seven <hi>United Provinces.</hi> I was at firſt puzzled which way to direct my Courſe in this large County; but at laſt reſolved to ſtrike thro' the Middle of the County, and along the North-eaſt Part of the Weſt Riding, up as far as <hi>Rippon,</hi> which is about the Centre of the County.</p>
            <p>This great County is divided into Three Ridings, North, Eaſt, and Weſt Riding. This laſt, which I chuſe firſt to ſpeak of, is much the largeſt and moſt populous, and has in it the greateſt Number of Towns, as well as the moſt conſiderable, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the beſt Manufactures, and conſequently the greateſt Share of Riches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheffield,</hi> ſituated on a riſing Ground, is the firſt Town we came to from <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi> It is famous for Whittle-making, Cutlery Wares and Iron-work, there being a great many good Iron Mines about it, and likewiſe ſome of Alum. The Town is very antient, and has been always conſiderable, tho' no Corporation; and that it was noted, in <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0141100403:94"/>
Time, for the ſame Trade, appears by thoſe Lines of his:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>— A Miller —</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>With a rizzled Beard, and a hooked Noſe,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And a</hi> Sheffield <hi>Whittle in his Hoſe.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Town is very populous and large, and the Houſes built with Stone, but look dark and black, by the continued Smoke of the Forges, which are always at Work; and the Streets are narrow. Here were ſet up the firſt Mills for turning Grind-ſtones in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church is very large and ſpacious, in the Form of a Croſs, and has a fine high Spire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheffield</hi> is reputed to excel <hi>Birmingham</hi> in Cutlery Wares and Files, and <hi>Birmingham</hi> is allow'd to out-do <hi>Sheffield</hi> in Locks, Hinges, Nails, and poliſh'd Steel.</p>
            <p>The Cutlers here are incorporated by the Style of <hi>The Cutlers of Hallamſhire,</hi> and have many Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. They are ſaid to be 600 in Number, and are called <hi>Maſter-cutlers</hi>; each of whom gives a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Stamp to his Wares. The Corporation chuſe a Maſter and other Officers yearly; and it is judged, that no leſs than 40000 are imploy'd in the Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade in <hi>Sheffield,</hi> and the adjacent Tract of Land called <hi>Hallamſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it will be judged, that the ſaid Pariſh-church, the only one in this populous Town, was not able to contain one half of the People of <hi>Sheffield</hi>; which induced one Mr. <hi>Robert Downes,</hi> Goldſmith of this Town, to contribute a large Sum, and to procure other Sums by Contributions, for erecting a Chapel of Eaſe; and accordingly he got Leave, <hi>Anno</hi> 1719, from <hi>William</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> to proceed in ſo good a Work, and built a handſome and ſtately Structure on a Piece of Ground called <hi>Shaw-cloſe,</hi> purchaſed by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Downes,</hi> who alſo ſettled to the Value of 30<hi>l.</hi> a Year for ever, on
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0141100403:95"/>
a Preacher, to be elected and nominated by him, his Heirs and Aſſigns.</p>
            <p>But tho' the Building was thus finiſhed, and Mr. <hi>Downes</hi> had actually nominated to it, his Nephew <hi>Joſeph Downes,</hi> yet the Nomination being conteſted by the Patrons of the Vicarage of <hi>Sheffield,</hi> and the Vicar alſo, it remained unconſecrated till the Year 1739; when the Parties differing, coming to an Agreement, an Act of Parliament paſſed, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; and it is now conſecrated by the Name of <hi>The Chapel of</hi> St. Paul <hi>in the Town of</hi> Sheffield.</p>
            <p>Formerly here was a very fine Caſtle, with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Manſion-houſe, the Seat of the Dukes of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>; but it is now all demoliſhed and decayed, tho' the Manor remains ſtill in the Family.</p>
            <p>In the great Church, in this Town, are ſeveral very antient Monuments of the Family of <hi>Talbots,</hi> Earls of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> who once had great Poſſeſſions in this and the next County.</p>
            <p>In particular, <hi>George,</hi> the firſt Earl of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> who died 1531. <hi>George</hi> the ſecond, Grandſon to the firſt, under whoſe Care the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was here in Cuſtody for 16 Years, who died 1590, and <hi>Gilbert</hi> his Son, who founded the ſtately Hoſpital in this Town, all lie buried here.</p>
            <p>The Gift of this Hoſpital is perpetuated in the following Inſcription:
<q>
                  <hi>The Hoſpital of the Right Honourable</hi> GILBERT <hi>Earl of</hi> Shrewſbury, <hi>erected and ſettled by the Right Honourable</hi> HENRY <hi>Earl of</hi> Norwich, <hi>Earl Marſhal of</hi> ENGLAND, <hi>great Grandſon of the ſaid Earl, in purſuance of his laſt Will and Teſtament,</hi> Anno 1673.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a fine Engine for raiſing Water to ſupply the Town. Here is alſo a very large and ſtrong
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0141100403:96"/>
Bridge over the <hi>Dun,</hi> as there is another at <hi>Rother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a Market-town Six Miles lower. Of late ſeveral Acts of Parliament have paſſed to make this River further navigable to different Places, which will greatly increaſe the Trade of thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>It is in the Park here, that the great Oak-tree grew formerly, of which Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> gives a long Account in his Book of Foreſt-trees. And what became of the Cheſnut-tree near <hi>Aderclift,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Camden</hi>'s Continuator, the Body of which could hardly be fathomed by three Men, I could hear no Account of.</p>
            <p>The Remains of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fortification between <hi>Sheffield</hi> and <hi>Rotherham</hi> are ſtill to be ſeen, and probably will continue to the End of Time.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo the famous Trench, by ſome called <hi>Devil's Bank,</hi> other <hi>Danes Bank</hi>; which is ſaid to run Five Miles in Length, and in ſome Places is called <hi>Kemp Bank,</hi> in others <hi>Temple's Bank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rotherham</hi> is the next Market-town North-eaſt of <hi>Sheffield.</hi> It is noted for its fine Stone Bridge over the <hi>Dun,</hi> which is here increaſed by the River <hi>Rother,</hi> from whence the Town, no doubt, took its Name.</p>
            <p>The Church is built in the Form of a Cathedral, and is a fair Stone Building, with a handſome Spire Steeple.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Rotherham</hi> we turned North-weſt to <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> on purpoſe to ſee the old Seat of the <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths,</hi> who have flouriſhed here ever ſince the Conqueſt, and been poſſeſſed of the Eſtate of <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> from the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> III. Among the ſeveral noble Perſons of this Family, who have reſided here, was the great <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> beheaded in the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. whoſe Body lies buried in this Church. His Honours were extinct in his Son; but his Seat is ſtill in the Poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> Earl of <hi>Malton,</hi> his Great Grandſon, who has made ſuch Improvements to it,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0141100403:97"/>
that it is inferior to few in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It is ſituated on the Side of a Hill, defended from the North and Weſt, but opens to the South and Eaſt, towards which Quarters it commands a very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Proſpect over a rich and beautiful Country, which belongs to the Family.</p>
            <p>The Gardens are large, and adorn'd with Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſks, Statues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having a Green-houſe and Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room. On one Side there is an uninterrupted View into the Park and Neighbourhood. Here are two Beauties rarely to be met with any-where elſe, a Grove of old Fir-trees, and a Mount of above 100 Feet high perpendicularly meaſured. The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Parks is about eight Miles, and is beautified with Fiſh-ponds, Woods of Timber of an uncommon Size, and with Plantations innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The Turf is of a fine Verdure, and the Soil fruitful.</p>
            <p>The Houſe, with the Additions lately made, and now carrying on, will extend 200 Yards in Front, and is built in Imitation of <hi>Wanſtead</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Seat of Earl <hi>Tilney.</hi> And an Improvement has been added to the Park and Fiſh-ponds, one whereof, conſiſting of 14 Acres of Ground, receives a ſmall Brook, which being conducted through a winding Cut, for 600 Yards, falling down ſix Steps, is brought by a Canal of 300 Yards into the Lake, and ſo affords a pretty Proſpect of Water for near a Mile together.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to ſee <hi>Stamborough,</hi> a fine Seat now belonging to the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>; the late Earl built the Houſe here, which has an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noble Front, and adorn'd it with large Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fine Water-works, and Gardens; to which if we add the Viſta's, Walks, and Woods, which are large and numerous, it may vie with moſt Seats in <hi>Great Britain</hi> for Elegancy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0141100403:98"/>We afterwards ſteer'd our Courſe back again to <hi>Rotherham,</hi> and leaving that Town, came to <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> a fine Seat of the Earl of <hi>Scarborough</hi>; which, conſidering the beautiful Lawn before the Houſe, and the Extent of the adjoining Woods, remarkable for the Improvements of Art, as well as for the Bigneſs and flouriſhing State of the Trees, may vie with moſt Seats, in reſpect to Situation.</p>
            <p>From hence we purſued a By-track, in order to ſee a famous Yew-tree, which ſtands in a Field called <hi>Cuckolds Haven,</hi> and is a very ſurpriſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Nature, and which I ſhall attempt to deſcribe: It has a ſtrait ſmooth Stem, about 10 Feet high, from which the Branches extend in Circles above each other, like the Diviſions of a Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apple, and of that Shape, and of equal Exactneſs. The Figure of the Tree is much more beautiful than could have been made by Art of Man. The Branches from Top to Bottom are ſo thick, that a Bird can ſcarce creep through them in any Part; and every Shoot and Fibre put out the ſame Length each Year, and are of ſo bright and pleaſant a Green in all Seaſons, that at ſome Diſtance the Cloathing of the Tree appears like Velvet. There is a Hedge planted round it for a Fence, and many People have thought it worth their while to ride 20 Miles to view it.</p>
            <p>Upon Sight of this Curioſity, and Thouſands of other Trees of the ſame Species in its Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I could not but lament, that Avarice ſhould ſo far prevail, eſpecially with Gentlemen, as to conſent to grant what I call a dead Warrant for the ſelling of many noble ſtately ones, in the Height of their Glory, which for ſome Hundred of Years had been an Ornament to the Places where they grew, when perhaps one of the largeſt of them, which in a Garden or Park would be eſteemed above any Price,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0141100403:99"/>
is ſold for no more than 20 or 30 Shillings, to make Naves for Wheels.</p>
            <p>Afterwards we ſtruck into a By-road, which brought us to the Ruins of <hi>Roch</hi> or <hi>Rock Abby,</hi> hid by a ſteep woody Cliff, towards the South, and by large Rocks every other Way, except Eaſtward. One Side of the Nef of this Building, from North to South, under the middle Tower, and ſome odd Pillars and Arches, are all that is now left, great Part having been carried away, from time to time, to repair adjacent Churches, or build Gentlemens Seats, tho' now Care is taken, by the preſent Earl of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> to preſerve what remains. Theſe Ruins, among which large Trees are now grown up, and the contiguous Borders, make a Picture inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly charming, eſpecially when viewed with the Lights and Shadows they receive from a Weſtern Sun; and its recluſe Situation, ſtill from every Noiſe, except the Murmur of a limpid Rivulet, together with the Fragments of ſepulchral Monuments, and the gloomy Shades of thoſe venerable Greens, Ivy, and Yew, which creep up, and luxuriantly branch out and mix with the beautiful Whiteneſs of the Rocks, give ſuch a Solemnity to this Scene, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a ſerious Reverence from the Beholder, and inſpires a contemplative Melancholy, oftentimes pleaſing as well as proper to indulge.</p>
            <p>The Stone, of which this Abbey is built, was dug out of the famous Quarry near adjoining, and ſo well known to Maſons by the Name of <hi>Roch Abbey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> which for Whiteneſs and Beauty is not to be equalled.</p>
            <p>Another thing worthy of Notice in this Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, is the Tower and Spire of the Church <hi>Laughton,</hi> which for a Delicacy and Juſtneſs of Proportion, is not excelled by any other <hi>Gothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Piece of the kind. How it happened, that ſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0141100403:100"/>
elegant and ornamental a Structure, ſuperior by far to all others round it, was beſtow'd upon a Village-church, is matter of ſome Wonder.</p>
            <p>The Building ſtands upon a very high Hill, which appears at Diſtance like that at <hi>Harrow</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> The Height of the Steeple to the Weather-cock is 195 Feet, and by its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the moſt conſpicuous every way, of any perhaps in the whole Kingdom, being ſeen from many Places 40, 50, and 60 Miles. It has a peculiar Beauty, when view'd in the diagonal Line, the Pinacles at the Corners of the Tower being join'd by Arches to the Spire, as are others above them, which break its Out-lines, and give, at the ſame time, a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diminution; but Time will not permit it to ſtand much longer without conſiderable Repairs.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Leeds,</hi> whoſe Seat at <hi>Kiveton</hi> is at about three Miles Diſtance, has cut a Viſta through the Woods of his Park, to take this Steeple into his View.</p>
            <p>About two Miles from <hi>Laughton</hi> we ſaw the ſaid Seat of <hi>Kiveton:</hi> It is an elegant Houſe, and the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Offices are diſpoſed with great Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency. The Situation is in a wholſome Air, and commands fine Proſpects. Here are pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and a beautiful Park.</p>
            <p>We omitted viſiting many other Places in theſe Parts, which, had Time allowed, would have anſwer'd the Trouble of riding uneven Roads, which are tireſome hereabouts, and haſtened to reach <hi>Tickhill,</hi> which is a ſmall Market-town, and very antient.</p>
            <p>Here is an old Caſtle, which is large, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a ſingle Wall only, and an huge Mount, with a round Tower on the Top of it. it was antiently of ſuch Dignity, that all the Manors round about it, belonging to it, were ſtyled <hi>The Honour of Tickhill.</hi> The Church in this Town is very large, and a handſome Building.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0141100403:101"/>We now return'd once more to <hi>Rotherham,</hi> and purſued our Courſe higher up on the River <hi>Dun,</hi> to <hi>Coningsborough</hi> Caſtle, called in Britiſh <hi>Caer Conan,</hi> ſituate on a Rock, where <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſays, That <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> General, and took him Priſoner, where, in Revenge of his barbarous Murder of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility in cold Blood, near <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> he cut off his Head.</p>
            <p>Before the Gate is an Agger, ſaid to be the Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of <hi>Hengiſt.</hi> It is not only famous for its Antiquity, but its Situation too, upon a pleaſant Aſcent, having ſix large Market-towns, 120 Villages, many large Woods of Oak, ſome containing 100 Acres, and others beautifully cut through into Walks, ſix Iron Furnaces, many Mines of Coal and Iron, Quarries of Stone for Building, nine large Stone Bridges, 40 Water-mills, ſix Seats of Noblemen, 60 of Gentlemen, 15 Parks, and two navigable Rivers. Upon the <hi>Dun</hi> alſo, a little Way from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsborough,</hi> is a Place called <hi>Temple-brough,</hi> a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Fortification, of which the North-eaſt Corner is waſh'd away by the River. The Area is about 200 Paces long, beſides the Agger; and on the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of it is a large Trench, 37 Paces deep; on the other Side of it is another Trench, cover'd with large Trees.</p>
            <p>Travelling North-eaſt from hence, we came to <hi>Bantry,</hi> which ſtands juſt at the Entrance from <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> into the Weſt-riding, a Town bleſſed with two great Conveniencies, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its Support, and make it a very well-frequented Place.<list>
                  <item>1. That it ſtands upon the great Poſt-road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi>; which makes it full of very good Inns and Houſes of Entertainment.</item>
                  <item>2. That the little, but pleaſant River <hi>Idle</hi> runs by it, which, contrary to the Import of its Name, is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0141100403:102"/>
a full and <hi>quick,</hi> tho' not rapid and unſafe Stream, with a deep Chanel, which carries Lighters and flat-bottom'd Veſſels into the <hi>Trent,</hi> that comes within ſeven Miles of it, to a Place called <hi>Stockwith,</hi> from thence to <hi>Burton,</hi> and from thence, if the Weather be fair, to <hi>Hull</hi>; if not, 'tis ſufficient to go to <hi>Stockwith,</hi> where Veſſels of 200 Tons Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den may come up laden to the Town.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By this Navigation <hi>Bantry</hi> becomes the Centre of all the Exportation of this Part of the Country, eſpecially for heavy Goods, which are brought down hither from all the adjacent Countries, ſuch as Lead, Mill-ſtones and Grind-ſtones from <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> wrought Iron and edged Tools of all Sorts, from the Forges at <hi>Sheffield,</hi> and from the adjacent Country called <hi>Hallamſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence to <hi>Doncaſter</hi> is a pleaſant Road, that never wants Repair, which is ſomething extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in any Part of this lower Side of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doncaſter</hi> (ſo called from the River on which it ſtands, and the Caſtle which is now ruined) is a noble, large, ſpacious Town, and exceeding popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, govern'd by a Mayor, and carrying on a great Manufacture, principally for Stockens, Gloves, and knit Waiſtcoats; and as it ſtands upon the great Northern Poſt-road, is full of good Inns. There is a remarkable old Column called a Croſs, at the End of the Town, with a <hi>Norman</hi> Inſcription upon it.</p>
            <p>Here we ſaw the firſt Remains of the great <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, which, tho' we could not perceive before, were eminent and remarkable juſt at the Entrance into the Town, and ſoon after appeared in many Places. Here are alſo two ſtrong Stone Bridges over the <hi>Dun,</hi> beſides a long Cauſeway beyond them, the Waters of the River being dangerous to Paſſengers, when they ſwell over its Banks, as is ſometimes the Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0141100403:103"/>This Town, Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"was burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the Ground, <hi>Anno</hi> 759; and was hardly recovered in his Time."</q>
But it now looks more decayed by Time than Accident, and the Houſes, which ſeem ready to fall, might riſe again to more Advantage after another Conflagration.</p>
            <p>It has but one Church, which is large, and its Tower of admirable Work. There is a remarkable Epitaph on one <hi>Robert Byrk,</hi> a famous Man of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> who gave a Place, called <hi>Roſſington Wood,</hi> to the Poor.

            <p>We ought not to forget, that the celebrated Sailor, Sir <hi>Martin Frobiſher,</hi> was born in this Town. He was the firſt <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who, in the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> diſcover'd the North Paſſage to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Cathai,</hi> and found ſome Streights, which he called after his own Name, and a Foreland after the Queen's. At his firſt Voyage, one of the Company brought back ſome black Stones, out of which the Refiners, it is ſaid, extracted Gold; which encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him to load his Ship with them afterwards: but they were then found to be fit for nothing, but to mend the Highways. He ſignalized himſelf againſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0141100403:104"/>
the <hi>Spaniſh Armada</hi>; and received his Death Wound by a Shot at <hi>Breſt</hi> in <hi>Britany</hi>: the Surgeon, having extracted the Bullet, left the Wadding behind; by which means the Wound mortified, and he died as ſoon as he had brought back the Fleet to <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſet forward directly Weſt, and came to <hi>Barneſley,</hi> a little Market-town, well-built of Stone, where a Manufacture, and Iron and Steel Work, flouriſhes. It has a ſmoaky Aſpect, and is called <hi>Black-Barneſley</hi>; but whether on that Account, or from the Moors, which look all black, like <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot Heath,</hi> I know not.</p>
            <p>After we had paſſed theſe Moors, we came thro' a moſt rich, pleaſant and populous Country to <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wakefield</hi> is a large Town, ſituate upon the River <hi>Calder,</hi> (which was made navigable in the Year 1698) ſince which Time the Town has increaſed conſiderably in Riches, and Number of Inhabitants. There is a handſome Stone Bridge over the River, upon which ſtands a Chapel, erected by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> IV. in Memory of his Father <hi>Richard,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was ſlain near this Place, as I ſhall mention by-and-by. The Chapel is 10 Yards long, and ſix broad; and tho' very much defaced by Time, it appears to have been wrought in a very curious manner. A little above the Bridge is a Waſh or Dam, over which the Water rolling, forms an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Caſcade of a great Length.</p>
            <p>This Town conſiſts of three great Streets, which meet in a Centre near the Church, where there might be formed a very ſpacious Market-place, but by reaſon of the great Number of Inhabitants it is ſo crouded with Buildings, that there is only a ſmall Area round the Market-croſs, which is a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Building, being an open Colonnade of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, ſupporting a Dome, to which you aſcend by an open circular Pair of Stairs, in the Centre of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0141100403:105"/>
Building. This brings you to a Room, which receives Light from a Turret on the Top, and may be called the Town-hall; for here they tranſact all their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Church is a very large and lofty <hi>Gothick</hi> Building, the Body of which was repaired in the Year 1724, but the Spire (which is one of the higheſt in the County) remains in the ſame State it was.</p>
            <p>In this Town was born <hi>John Green,</hi> the famous Pinder, who fought <hi>Robin Hood</hi> ſo manfully.</p>
            <p>From the Bridge you have an agreeable View to the South-eaſt, where, by the Side of the River, riſes a Hill, covered with Wood, at about a Mile Diſtance. This joins to an open Moor or Common called <hi>Heath-moor,</hi> upon which are ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Seats, very pleaſantly ſituated.</p>
            <p>South between <hi>Wakefield</hi> and a Village called <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

But tho' Religion has ſuffered the Croſs to fall, the Chapel I mentioned on the Bridge at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> the other Monument of this Battle, is ſtill preſerved by being made uſe of for Civil Affairs. Some ſay there are more People here, than in the City of <hi>York,</hi> and yet it is no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration Town.</p>
            <p>Here is a Market every <hi>Friday</hi> for Woollen Cloths, after the manner of that at <hi>Leeds,</hi> tho' not ſo great; yet as all the Clothing Trade is prodigiouſly increaſed, and ſtill increaſing in this County, ſo this M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ket flouriſhes with the reſt.</p>
            <p>I cannot here paſs by my former Obſervation, that all the great Rivers take their Beginning in the Mountains of <hi>Blackſtone Edge</hi> and <hi>High Peak,</hi> which, as I have ſaid, part the Counties of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0141100403:106"/>
               <hi>York,</hi> and that theſe Rivers all take their Courſe due Eaſt. The <hi>Dun</hi> is the firſt; the next is the <hi>Calder,</hi> now becoming a very large River at <hi>Wakefield</hi>; and the <hi>Aire</hi> is the next, which riſes at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>Penigent,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> of which 'tis ſaid proverbially:
<q>
                  <l>Pendle-Hill <hi>and</hi> Penigent</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Are the higheſt Hills between</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Trent.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Calder</hi> runs by <hi>Halifax, Huthersfield,</hi> and thro' <hi>Wakefield</hi>; ſo the <hi>Aire</hi> runs by <hi>Skipton, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and thro' <hi>Leeds,</hi> and then both join at <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Bridge, near <hi>Pontefract,</hi> three Miles from <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and in an united Stream form that Navigation from this trading Part of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> to <hi>Hull,</hi> which is of ſo much Advantage to the whole County.</p>
            <p>I went to ſee the antient Town of <hi>Pontefract,</hi> with the Caſtle, where ſo much Blood has been ſpilt, in different Ages; for here <hi>Henry,</hi> the great Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who was Lord of the Caſtle, and whoſe Anceſtors had beautified, inlarged, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it, was beheaded by his Nephew, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> II. with three or four more of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barons. Here <hi>Richard</hi> II. was murder'd, and, if Hiſtory may be credited, in a moſt cruel manner; and here <hi>Antony</hi> Earl of <hi>Rivers,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Gray,</hi> the firſt Uncle, and the other Brother-in-law to King <hi>Edward</hi> V. were beheaded by King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> III. In the late Civil Wars, a ſmall Party of brave Fellows took this Caſtle by Surprize, for the King, and deſperately defended it to the laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; but being at length obliged to yield, five of them attempted to break thro' the Beſiegers Camp, three of whom periſhed in the Attempt.</p>
            <p>The Town is large and well built, but much ſmaller than it has been. The Caſtle lies in its Ruins, though not demoliſhed. It is a Corporation by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and the Mayor and 12 Aldermen are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0141100403:107"/>
Juſtices of the Peace. 'Tis ſaid, that antiently none could be arreſted at the Market-croſs, call'd <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s Croſs, and a free Way leading to the Croſs, with about two Yards around it was kept unpav'd in Memory of that Privilege. But in the Year 1735, the old Croſs was pulled down, and a handſome Dome, ſupported by a Colonnade of <hi>Dorick</hi> Pillars, (the Charge whereof was defrayed by a Legacy left by one <hi>Dupere,</hi> an Inhabitant of the Town) was erected for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Ruins of the Caſtle ſhew it to have been a noble Pile. A round Tower, yet ſtanding, is intire, in or near which, the Tradition is, King <hi>Richard</hi> II. was ſlain. Adjoining to this Tower are Winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs, which deſcend into ſeveral Vaults, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Paſſages.</p>
            <p>The Pariſh Church, which ſtands near the Caſtle, and was prodigiouſly large, received ſo much Damage in the late Civil Wars, that no more than the Shell is now left ſtanding. It is a handſome <hi>Gothick</hi> Building, in the Form of a Croſs, with a Tower in the middle, which is in good Proportion, and was formerly crown'd with a magnificent Lantern, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with carved Work; but it received ſuch Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from a Cannon Shot, during the Siege of the Caſtle, that it was ſoon after blown down; and upon the Surrender of the Caſtle, the Parliament did (by Reſolution of the Houſe, of the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> 1649) grant One thouſand Pounds, to be raiſed by Sale of the Materials of the ſaid Caſtle, to the Town of <hi>Pontefract,</hi> towards the repairing of their Place of publick Worſhip, and re-edifying an Habitation for a Miniſter. Part of this Grant might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in erecting a plain Octagon Building upon the Tower, which finiſhes the Whole, in a manner not diſagreeable, tho' far inferior to the former. In the North weſt Corner of this Tower, are two circular Flights of Stairs, winding about the ſame Centre,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0141100403:108"/>
with ſeparate Entrances below, and diſtinct Landings above. The Inhabitants of the Town ſtill continue to bury in this Church-yard, but Divine Service is perform'd in a Chapel adjoining to the Market-place, which is very ſpacious.</p>
            <p>At the Bottom of the Market-place ſtands the Town-hall.</p>
            <p>Near the Road is a noble Seat, which belonged to the late Lord <hi>Bingley.</hi> 'Tis a new-built, beautiful Houſe, with curious Gardens, tho' not very large.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Pontefract</hi> the great <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, which I mentioned at <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> (and is viſible from thence hither in ſeveral Places, tho' not in the open Road) is plain to be diſcern'd; and from <hi>Caſtleford</hi> Bridge, which croſſes over the united Rivers of <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> it goes on to <hi>Aberforth,</hi> and ſo thro' <hi>Tadcaſter</hi> to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome Places, where this Cauſeway is broken up, the Courſes appear to be of different Materials, the Bottom of Clay, upon that is Chalk, then Gravel, and upon the Gravel is Stone, and then Gravel upon that, and ſo other kinds of Earth, where the firſt was not to be had.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral Places between this Bridge and <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi> the Cauſeway being diſuſed for the common Road, it appears as intire as at its firſt making, tho' a Work undoubtedly of 15 or 1600 Years old. I take notice of it here, becauſe I have not ſeen any thing like it in any other Place of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtleford</hi> is a Village that ſtands near the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the two Rivers above, and was formerly a Place of great Conſideration, inſomuch that ſome Authors call it a City. There have been dug up here divers Pieces of <hi>Roman</hi> Coin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aberforth</hi> is a ſmall Market-town, a few Miles North-eaſt of <hi>Pontefract,</hi> and is noted for Pin-making only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0141100403:109"/>From <hi>Ferry-bridge,</hi> within a Mile of <hi>Pontefract,</hi> extends a large Stone Cauſeway, about a Mile in Length, to a Village called <hi>Brotherton,</hi> where <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> Wife of King <hi>Edward</hi> I. was forced to take up as ſhe was hunting, and was delivered of a Son, called from the Village <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Brotherton.</hi> This Son was afterwards made Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Marſhal of <hi>England.</hi> Not far from the Church is a Piece of Ground of 20 Acres, ſurrounded with a Trench and a Wall, where, as Tradition informs us, ſtood the Houſe in which the Queen was delivered, and the Tenants are obliged by Tenure to keep it ſurrounded with a Wall of Stone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brotherton</hi> is now noted for burning Lime-ſtone, which is brought from <hi>Tadcaſter</hi> in great Quantities, and carrying and diſperſing it into the Southern Parts, which turns to very good Account, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys a great many Hands.</p>
            <p>A little to the South of this Village, the great Road divides in two Parts: one goes on to the Right to <hi>York,</hi> and the other thro' <hi>Aberforth</hi> and <hi>Wetherby,</hi> over <hi>Braham-moor,</hi> to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Braham-moor</hi> a Battle was fought between the Royaliſts and General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> where he was worſted and wounded, but made ſo Soldier-like a Retreat, that it gained him as great a Reputation as a Victory would have done.</p>
            <p>But we followed neither of theſe two Roads, leaving the Towns that way for the Entertainment of another Journey; ſo we paſs'd directly Weſt along the Banks of the <hi>Aire</hi> to <hi>Leeds,</hi> which is a large, wealthy and populous Town, ſtanding on the North Side of the River <hi>Aire,</hi> with large Suburbs on the South Side, and both joined by a ſtately, ſtrong Stone Bridge, ſo large, and ſo wide, that formerly the Cloth-market was kept upon it; and therefore the Refreſhment given the Clothiers by the Inn-keepers (being a Pot of Ale, a Noggin of Pottage,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0141100403:110"/>
and a Trencher of broil'd or roaſt Beef, for Two-pence) is called the <hi>Brigg-ſhot</hi> to this Day.</p>
            <p>The Increaſe of the Manufactures, and of the Trade, ſoon made the Market too great to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Brigg, ſo that it is now kept in the High Street, beginning from the Bridge, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up North almoſt to the Market-houſe, where the ordinary Market for Proviſions begins; which alſo is the greateſt of its kind in all the North of <hi>England.</hi> You may judge of the Plenty of it, when 500 Loads of Apples have been numbered by the Mayor's Officers in a Day.</p>
            <p>But the Cloth Market is chiefly to be admired as a Prodigy of its Kind, and perhaps not to be equalled in the World. The Market for Serges at <hi>Exeter</hi> is indeed a wonderful Thing, and the Money returned very great; but it is there but once a Week, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here it is every <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Saturday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Early in the Morning, Treſſels are placed in two Rows in the Street, ſometimes two Rows on a Side, croſs which Boards are laid, which make a kind of temporary Counter on either Side, from one End of the Street to the other.</p>
            <p>The Clothiers come early in the Morning with their Cloth; and as few bring more than one Piece, the Market-days being ſo frequent, they goin to the Inns and Publick-houſes with it, and there ſet it down.</p>
            <p>At about Six o'Clock in the Summer, and about Seven in the Winter, the Clothiers being all come by that Time, the Market Bell at the old Chapel by the Bridge rings; upon which it would ſurpriſe a Stranger to ſee in how few Minutes, without Hurry, Noiſe, or the leaſt Diſorder, the whole Market is filled, and all the Boards upon the Treſſels covered with Cloth, as cloſe to one another as the Pieces can lie longways, each Proprietor ſtanding behind his own Piece, who form a Mercantile Regiment,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0141100403:111"/>
as it were, drawn up in a double Line, in as great Order as a Military one.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Bell has done Ringing, the Factors and Buyers of all Sorts enter the Market, and walk up and down between the Rows, as their Occaſions direct. Some of them have their foreign Letters of Orders, with Patterns ſealed on them, in their Hands; the Colours of which they match, by holding them to the Cloths they think they agree to. When they have pitched upon their Cloth, they lean over to the Clothier, and by a Whiſper, in the feweſt Words imaginable, the Price is ſtated; one aſks, the other bids; and they agree or diſagree in a Moment.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this prudent Silence is owing to the Clothiers ſtanding ſo near to one another; for 'tis not reaſonable, that one Trader ſhould know an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's Traffick.</p>
            <p>If a Merchant has bidden a Clothier a Price, and he will not take it, he may go after him to his Houſe, and tell him he has conſidered of it, and is willing to let him have it; but they are not to make any new Agreement for it, ſo as to remove the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket from the Street to the Merchant's Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Buyers generally walk up and down twice on each Side of the Rows, and in little more than an Hour all the Buſineſs is done. In leſs than half an Hour you will perceive the Cloth begin to move off, the Clothier taking it up upon his Shoulder to carry it to the Merchant's Houſe. At about half an Hour after Eight the Market Bell rings again, upon which the Buyers immediately diſappear, the Cloth is all ſold; or if any remains, it is carried back into the Inn. By Nine o'Clock the Boards and Treſſels are removed, and the Street left at Liberty for the Market-people of other Profeſſions, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-drapers, Shoe-makers, Hard-ware Men, and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0141100403:112"/>Thus, you ſee 10 or 20,000<hi>l.</hi> worth of Cloth, and ſometimes much more, bought and ſold in little more than an Hour, the Laws of the Market being the moſt ſtrictly obſerved, that I ever ſaw in any Market in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be aſked, How all theſe Goods at this Place, at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and at <hi>Halifax,</hi> are vended and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of? I would obſerve,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there is a Home-conſumption; to ſupply which, ſeveral conſiderable Traders in <hi>Leeds</hi> go with Droves of Pack-horſes, loaden with thoſe Goods, to all the Fairs and Market-towns almoſt over the whole Iſland, not to ſell by Retail, but to the Shops by Wholeſale; giving large Credit. 'Tis ordinary for one of theſe Men to carry a thouſand Pounds worth of Cloth with him at a Time, and having ſold that, to ſend his Horſes back for as much more, and this very often in a Summer; for they travel chiefly at that Seaſon, becauſe of the Badneſs of the Roads.</p>
            <p>There are others, who have Commiſſions from <hi>London</hi> to buy, or who give Commiſſions to Factors and Warehouſe-keepers in <hi>London</hi> to ſell for them, who not only ſupply all the Shop-keepers and Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale Men in <hi>London,</hi> but ſell alſo very great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities to the Merchants, as well for Exportation to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> which take off great Quantities of the coarſe Goods, eſpecially <hi>New England, New York, Virginia,</hi> &amp;c. as alſo to the <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Merchants, who ſend exceeding great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities to <hi>Peterſburg, Riga, Dantzick, Narva,</hi> and to <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Pomerania</hi>; tho' of late the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of this kind ſet up in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and other Northern Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> interfere a little with them.</p>
            <p>The third Sorts are ſuch as receive Commiſſions from abroad, to buy Cloth for the Merchants chiefly in <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and in <hi>Holland, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are not only
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0141100403:113"/>
many in Number, but ſome of them very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their Dealings, and correſpond with the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Provinces in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On account of this Trade it was, that the Rivers <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Calder</hi> were made navigable, under the Direction of Alderman <hi>Pickering,</hi> the celebrated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Marrow of Mathematicks,</hi> and performed at the Expence of ſeveral private Merchants, without calling in the Aſſiſtance of the Nobility and Gentry. By this means a Communication was opened from <hi>Leeds</hi> and <hi>Wakefield</hi> to <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> ſo that all the Woollen Manufactures now exported, are carried by Water to <hi>Hull,</hi> and there ſhipped for <hi>Holland, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Hamburgh,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick.</hi> And, encouraged by the Succeſs of this Act, in the Seſſion of Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1740. an Act paſſed for continuing the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the River <hi>Calder</hi> from <hi>Wakefield</hi> to <hi>Ealand,</hi> and <hi>Halifax,</hi> which will be a farther Benefit to the Trade of thoſe Parts; and at the ſame time ſeveral other Acts paſſed for mending of Highways around all theſe Parts, to <hi>Halifax, Ealand, Doncaſter, York, &amp;c.</hi> which will no leſs promote the Commerce and Trade of this noble County.</p>
            <p>There is another Trade in this Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, become very conſiderable ſince the opening the above Navigation, which is the Carriage of Coals down from <hi>Wakefield</hi> and <hi>Leeds,</hi> at both which Places they have inexhauſtible Stores. Theſe are carried quite down into the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and then either go up that River to <hi>York,</hi> or down to the <hi>Humber,</hi> where the <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Ouſe</hi> meet together, and which in a few Miles falls into the Sea. In this Paſſage abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of large Towns are ſupplied with Coal, with this Advantage too, that whereas the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coals pay four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Chaldron Duty to the Publick, theſe, being only <hi>River-borne Coal,</hi> are exempted, and pay nothing: So that the City of <hi>York,</hi> which ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the firſt Navigation of theſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0141100403:114"/>
Rivers, in this Particular, as well as in many others, daily experiences the Benefit of it.</p>
            <p>I need not add, that by the ſame Navigation all heavy Goods, imported to <hi>Hull,</hi> are brought up theſe Rivers, as well as Goods brought from <hi>London,</hi> and other Parts of the Kingdom, ſuch as Butter, Cheeſe, Lead, Iron, Salt, Sugars, Tobacco, Fruit, Spice, Hops, Oil, Wine, Brandy, Spirits, and the like.</p>
            <p>The Antiquity of <hi>Leeds</hi> is very great, being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Venerable <hi>Bede</hi>; but it was not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated till 2 <hi>Car.</hi> I. when Sir <hi>John Savile</hi> (afterwards Lord <hi>Savile)</hi> was made the firſt honorary Alderman, in Memory of whom the Arms of the Town are adorned with his Supporters, and thoſe very ſuitable, being the two <hi>Athenian</hi> Birds, ſacred to that Goddeſs who was deem'd the Patroneſs of Spinning and Weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as Arts in general.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt End of the Town formerly ſtood a Caſtle, wherein King <hi>Richard</hi> II. was impriſoned before he was carried to <hi>Pontefract.</hi> And on the Scite thereof now ſtands the antient Manor-houſe, with the Park, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lately belonging to Mr. <hi>Richard Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es.</hi> Here are two magnificent Halls, both built about the Year 1714; one for White Cloths, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Pillars and Arches, which form a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle like the Royal Exchange, with a handſome Cupola, and Bell on the Top, to give Notice when the Market for theſe Sort of Goods begins. The other is the Guild or Moot Hall, the Front of which is built likewiſe on Arches, with ruſtick Coins and Tabling; where, in a Nich, is placed a fine Statue of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> done by Mr. <hi>Carpenter,</hi> at the Expence of Alderman <hi>Milner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are three Churches. <hi>St. Peter's,</hi> the Pariſh Church, is built in the Form of a Croſs, with a Tower riſing from the Middle, with eight Bells in it. In the Ceiling is <hi>the Giving of the Law,</hi> finely
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0141100403:115"/>
painted in Freſco by <hi>Parmentier,</hi> who voluntarily gave this Specimen of his Art, in Gratitude for the Encouragement he had met with here. <hi>St. John</hi>'s was built in 1634, at the ſole Expence of Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> who likewiſe built the Alms-houſes adjoining, a Free-ſchool, a Market-croſs, and the Street called <hi>New-ſtreet,</hi> the Rents of which he appropriated to pious Uſes.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit the New Chapel, as it is called, erected by the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in 1691; which is ſaid to have been the firſt, as it certainly is the ſtatelieſt they have in the North of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Leeds</hi> we advanced Northward, and came to <hi>Harwood,</hi> a pretty little Town on the River <hi>Wherfe,</hi> over which is a very coſtly Bridge, and there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was a ſtrong Caſtle. The Church here is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for ſeveral things; particularly for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrment of Sir <hi>William Gaſcoigne,</hi> who had the Courage to commit Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> afterwards K. <hi>Henry</hi> V. to the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> for affronting him while he was in the Seat of Juſtice, letting him know, that though the Son might bear the Image of the King's <hi>Perſon,</hi> the Judge bore that of his <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſed the <hi>Wherfe</hi> over a fine Stone Bridge of 11 Arches. The River runs in a Bed of Stone (which makes it look as clear as Rock Water).</p>
            <p>The Plenty of Stone in the North is, no doubt, the Reaſon why there are ſo many noble Bridges in that Part of <hi>England,</hi> inſomuch that I don't remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have ſeen one of Timber from the <hi>Trent</hi> to the <hi>Tweed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We travelled along the <hi>Wherfe</hi> into the <hi>Dale,</hi> that takes its Name from the River, which reaches from <hi>York</hi> about 20 Miles, enlivened almoſt all the Way with Gentlemens Seats at a little Diſtance from each other; and left <hi>Ottley</hi> on the South-ſide of the River, a ſmall Market-town, no otherwiſe of Note than
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0141100403:116"/>
for its Situation, which is under a large craggy Cliff. If <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> owed us any Pleaſure for the Fatigues of a former Day, it was abundantly made up to us here; for I cannot but think this one of the moſt delightful Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and I have met with Travellers who have compared it to the Plain of <hi>Palermo</hi> itſelf. Nor ought you to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to hear ſome Parts of the North compared with <hi>Italy.</hi> The Teſtimony of Biſhop <hi>Tonſtal</hi> is well known, who in his Progreſs to <hi>York</hi> with King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the Year 1548, declared, that the Country North of <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and South of <hi>Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> was the richeſt he had found in his Travels thro' <hi>Europe.</hi> It would be endleſs to mention all the Seats we paſſed; but the Motto, at leaſt, of Mr. <hi>Ibbotſon</hi>'s at <hi>Denton</hi> will naturally engage the Speculation of every Traveller:
<q>QVOD NEC IOVIS IRA, NEC IGNIS, NEC POTERIT FERRVM.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe, it ſeems, belonged once to Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> General of the Parliament Forces, and was about to be demoliſhed by Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>; but was happily ſaved by the Sight of a Picture of one of the General's worthy Anceſtors. It was afterwards burnt down by Accident, and rebuilt by the preſent Poſſeſſor; and now, after the Rage of War, and Devaſtation of Fire, in a Poetical Rant, defies them both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knareſborough,</hi> known among Foreigners by the Name of the <hi>Yorkſhire Spaw,</hi> ſtands near <hi>Ripley,</hi> a Market-town, upon the River <hi>Nyd.</hi> In the Town, and the Lands adjacent, are no leſs than four differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Mineral Waters. One of the Springs is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying Water, which in a little Cave drops from the Roof of the Cavity, and, as they ſay, turns Wood into Stone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0141100403:117"/>The other two Springs are indeed the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rarities of the kind in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is the <hi>Sweet Spaw,</hi> or a Vitriolick Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It was diſcovered by one Mr. <hi>Slingſby, Anno</hi> 1630; and all Phyſicians acknowlege it to be a very ſovereign Medicine in ſeveral particular Diſtempers. <hi>See Dr.</hi> Leigh'<hi>s Natural Hiſtory of</hi> Lancaſhire.</p>
            <p>The other is the <hi>Stinking Spaw,</hi> or, according to the Learned, the <hi>Sulphur Well.</hi> This Water is clear as Cryſtal, but ſo fetid and nauſeous to the Smell, that many are obliged to hold their Noſes when they drink it; yet it is a valuable Medicine in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick, Hypochondriack, and eſpecially in Hydropick Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>The People formerly, for many Years, only drank theſe Waters, but they now make uſe of them as a Cold Bath; and in this manner they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be very good for Rheumatick Pains, Paralytick Numbneſſes, and many other Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Theſe Baths were heretofore well frequented, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that I have been told 200<hi>l. per Annum</hi> Rent has been given for a Cold Bath. But now <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> has the Vogue.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rippon</hi> are two good Stone Bridges, one of which has, I think, thirteen Arches, or more, over the <hi>Eure,</hi> and is a very ſtately one. There is another over the ſame River at <hi>Burrowbrigg,</hi> four Miles lower than <hi>Rippon,</hi> which has indeed but four or five Arches, but then theſe Arches are near 40 Feet wide, and one of the middlemoſt much more, and are high in proportion; the Ends of the Bridge are likewiſe continued by high Cauſeways, built of Stone, to keep the Water in its Courſe, which however ſometimes overflows them.</p>
            <p>From theſe Bridges, as well as that above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at <hi>Harwood,</hi> it may be obſerved, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever low theſe Waters are in the Summer, they are high and furious enough in the Winter; and yet the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0141100403:118"/>
River <hi>Aire,</hi> tho' its Source is in the ſame Ridge of Mountains as the other, is gentle and mild in its Stream, whereas the others are raging and furious. The only Reaſons I can give for it, are, that this River runs in a thouſand Windings and Turnings more than any other in theſe Parts, inſomuch that, as <hi>Camden</hi> expreſſes it, near its Head in <hi>Craven</hi> it ſeems doubtful whether it ſhould run forward to the Sea, or return to its Spring; and from <hi>Skipton</hi> to <hi>Gargrave</hi> it is obſerved to be paſſed over eight times within the Compaſs of three Miles. The next Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that after it has deſcended from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it has a deeper Chanel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rippon,</hi> the <hi>Iſurium</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is a very neat, pleaſant, well-built Town; and an antient Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: it has not only an agreeable Situation on a riſing Ground between two Rivers, but the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are good likewiſe, particularly the Market-place, which is accounted the fineſt and moſt beautiful Square of its kind in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the middle of it ſtands a curious Obeliſk, built by Mr. <hi>Aiſlaby,</hi> whoſe Seat at <hi>Studley</hi> is about a Mile diſtant. The Town is govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen.</p>
            <p>Here is a large Collegiate Church, and tho' but a Deanry in the Dioceſe of <hi>York,</hi> yet it is a very handſome, antient, and venerable Pile, and ſhews itſelf a great way in the Country. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, <hi>Rippon</hi> owes its Greatneſs to Religion. And that here was a famous Monaſtery built by <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> in the firſt Ages of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in this Iſland, is certain; but this pious Gift of the Biſhop was loſt ſome Years after; for the <hi>Danes</hi> over-running <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> rifled and burnt it to the Ground, together with the whole Town of <hi>Rippon.</hi> It afterwards flouriſhed again as a Monaſtery: but that, with the reſt, being given up in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. the Church only was preſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0141100403:119"/>While it was a Monaſtery, here was a famous Sanctuary, a Thing much abuſed in foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. This Privilege was, it ſeems, granted to the Church of <hi>Rippon</hi> by King <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> and whoever broke the Rights of Sanctuary, which he extended a Mile around the Church, were to forfeit Life and Eſtate; ſo that, in ſhort, not the Church only, but the whole Town, and a Circle of two Miles diameter, was a Refuge for all that fled to it, where they lived ſafe, and out of the Reach of all Law.</p>
            <p>Annexed to this Monaſtery was an Hoſpital, the Purpoſes of which are very remarkable, and would be worthy Imitation in our Days of Proteſtant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Houſe was called the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> where, according to the Foundation, were to be maintained two Chaplains, to perform Divine Service; and if any begging Clergyman, or other needy Perſon ſhould happen to travel or ſtray out of his Way, and call at the ſaid Hoſpital, he ſhould be relieved there for one Night only, with Food and a Bed, and ſo be gone in the Morning; and every poor Perſon that came craving an Alms on St. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi>'s Day yearly, ſhould have one Loaf, Value an Half-peny, (when Corn was at the Price of five Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter) and one Herring.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo recorded, that one Branch of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital was given to a Society of religious Siſters to maintain a Chaplain to perform Divine Service; and to keep all the <hi>Lepers</hi> born and bred in <hi>Hipſchire</hi>; but the Siſters being in time removed, a Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was eſtabliſhed in their ſtead, which continued for a while; and after that a Maſterſhip. At length all, except the Church, was demoliſhed together, and the Houſe with the Monaſtery ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>The Church is an antient <hi>Gothick</hi> Building, firm, ſtrong, and plain; no Imagery or Statues to be ſeen about it; there are three Towers, on which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were Spires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0141100403:120"/>The whole Revenues were ſeized by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VIII. ſo that little or nothing remained for an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating Clergyman. But King <hi>James</hi> I. having the Caſe repreſented to him by his Queen, was pleaſed to found and endow in this Church one Dean, and ſeven Prebendaries, beſides Petit-canons, Singing-men, and Choiriſters, of his own Royal Bounty and Benevolence, under the Juriſdiction of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt not leave <hi>Rippon</hi> without mentioning St. <hi>Wilfrid's Needle,</hi> a Place famous in antient Times, being a narrow Hole in a cloſe vaulted Room under Ground, in which Womens Chaſtity was tried; and, if chaſte, they paſſed thro', but if otherwiſe, the Whim was, they could not. Some <hi>Saxon</hi> Coins were found here in the Year 1695.</p>
            <p>In the Church-yard of this Minſter lies a plain Monument, or Graveſtone, over the Remains of a generous Soul, who gave Two thouſand Pounds to pious Uſes, and yet has no other Epitaph than the following:
<q>
                  <hi>Hic jacet</hi> Zacharias Jepſon, <hi>cujus Aetas fuit</hi> 49.<lb/>
                  <hi>per paucos annos tantum vixit.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſpent a conſiderable Part of a Day in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Park, or rather Garden, belonging to Mr. <hi>Aiſlabie,</hi> which is viſited by all the Curious, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired as a Wonder, not only with regard to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beauties, which Nature has ſo laviſhly beſtowed; but thoſe of Art and Cultivation, wherewith it is ſo liberally adorned: the latter exhibit a noble Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that exquiſite fine Taſte for Architecture and Gardening, in which the preſent worthy Owner is allowed to excel. The Temples and Loggio's, built in many delightful Receſſes, may vie with the beſt Models of the Antients; and the wide extended Plantations are judiciouſly varied, as the Objects of the Landſchape become new. In one Part, the Hills
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0141100403:121"/>
gradually aſcend, with Tufts of Shade interſpers'd over the Verdure; in another, they precipitately riſe, with Rocks projecting from their rough Sides, and tall Woods covering their Brows. Above theſe, a beautiful <hi>Gothick</hi> (but unconſecrated) Tower lifts up its Head; and below, the Skirts of the Cliffs are watered by a River which wanders in one Place with a ſilent Current, and in another falls down in Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades: An eaſy Eminence commands a Proſpect of the Town and Minſter of <hi>Rippon,</hi> with a large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Country beyond; and the ſtately Ruins of <hi>Fountain-Abbey</hi> are ſeen from another, beſides Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Seats in the Centre of many Views. The fine Turf of the Park is conſtantly cleared of Weeds, and equal Care is taken to preſerve the beſt Trees from Decay: Through the whole Scene of Variety, the Improvements are adapted to follow the luxuriant Fancy of Nature, and humour her different Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. You ſee her deck'd out and inrich'd, where Neceſſity or Propriety beſpeak ſuch Indulgence; but in the Simplicity of her own Dreſs, where Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would disfigure her beautiful Attire.</p>
            <p>The Houſe is an old Building, but a noble Plan is laid down for a new one, and in a better Situation of the Park. There are Stables built, which are very grand.</p>
            <p>The late Biſhop of <hi>Namur,</hi> (Abbot <hi>Strickland</hi>) when he reſided in <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1734, took a Journey from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Studley,</hi> with Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tranſplant ſome of the Beauties of this Place, as near as might be, in the Diſpoſition of his Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, adjoining to a magnificent Palace he was then about to build at his epiſcopal Reſidence.</p>
            <p>A Mile from <hi>Rippon,</hi> or leſs, is a ſtately beautiful Seat, called <hi>Newbie,</hi> built ſome Years ſince by Sir <hi>Edward Blacket.</hi> The Park is extended to the Bank of the River <hi>Eure,</hi> and is ſometimes in part laid under Water by the River, which, coming down
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0141100403:122"/>
from the Weſtern Mountains thro' a marly, loamy Soil, fructifies the Earth, they ſay, as the River <hi>Nile</hi> does the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Fields about <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Sir <hi>Edward</hi> ſpared no Coſt in the Building, and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> laid out the Deſign, as well as choſe the Situation, I ſhall only ſay, tbat nothing can be added to the one or the other. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of Brick, the Avenues to it are very fine, and the Gardens not only well laid out, but well planted, and as well kept. But for want of fine Gravel, the Walks cannot ſhew themſelves, as they would do, were they in the Southern Part of <hi>England.</hi> The Houſe has a fine Proſpect over the Country, almoſt to <hi>York,</hi> with the River in View moſt of the Way; and it has a very noble Appearance to the great North Road, which lies at <hi>Burrow-bridge,</hi> within two Miles of it.</p>
            <p>As you begin to come into the <hi>North-riding,</hi> (for the <hi>Eure</hi> parts the <hi>Weſt-riding</hi> from it) you find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Place noted in the North of <hi>England</hi> for the beſt and largeſt Oxen, and the fineſt galloping Horſes, bred either for the light Saddle, for the Race, or the Chace, for Running or Hunting. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was a Grazier, and took ſuch Delight in Breeding and Feeding large Black Cattle, that he had two or three times an Ox out of his Park led about the Country for a Sight, and ſhewed as far as <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and even to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the biggeſt Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock in <hi>England,</hi> and 'twas very ſeldom, if ever, he was over-match'd.</p>
            <p>From the Town of <hi>Rippon</hi> the North Road, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Way alſo, which comes from <hi>Caſtleford-bridge,</hi> parting at <hi>Aberforth,</hi> leads away from the Town of <hi>Bedal,</hi> in the <hi>North-riding,</hi> and in a ſtrait Line called <hi>Leeming-Lane,</hi> leaving <hi>Richmond</hi> about two Miles on the Weſt, goes on to <hi>Piers-bridge,</hi> on the River <hi>Tees,</hi> which are the utmoſt Limits of this vaſt County of <hi>York.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0141100403:123"/>But as I propoſed at my entering into this <hi>Weſt-riding</hi> to go no further than <hi>Rippon,</hi> which ſtands on the Northern Boundary of it, I muſt ſtop here, and likewiſe make it the Boundary, as well of this Journey as of this Letter, ſince I find it impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to take a Survey of this large, populous, and wealthy Diviſion on one Journey, without wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro, up and down, backward and forward, on purpoſe, which would be exceedingly fatiguing and uneaſy; and as I was reſolved to make as perfect Obſervations as I poſſibly could, of every thing that I could find remarkable in my way, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Manufactures of the Country, which I account as well worthy a Traveller's Notice, as the Curioſities and Wonders of Nature, and the moſt refin'd Operations of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, I have therefore concluded upon another Journey into theſe Parts, and to enter by the Way of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi>; and to coaſt it along the Weſt and North-weſt Sides of the Country, up to the River <hi>Tees,</hi> and the Southern Side of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham</hi>; and from thence ſtrike down South into the Centre of the County, and ſo take a Trip Eaſt into the Heart of the <hi>North-riding,</hi> to ſee the Towns that lie that Way; and then return Weſt into <hi>York,</hi> and paſſing thence South-eaſt, take in ſuch Towns as ſtand on the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Weſt-riding,</hi> till I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Fall of the <hi>Trent</hi> into the <hi>Humber</hi>; and croſſing that River, view the Towns in the <hi>Eaſt-riding</hi>; and laſtly, follow the Sea-coaſt all the Way up into <hi>Durham,</hi> which will complete my Tour through the whole County.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to what I propoſed in my laſt, I am now going to enter the <hi>Weſt-riding</hi> of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> from the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to you, that all this Part of the County is ſo conſiderable for its Trade, that the Poſt-maſter General has thought fit to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Croſs-poſt through all the Weſtern Part of <hi>England</hi> into it, to maintain the Correſpondence of Merchants and Men of Buſineſs, of which all this Side of the Iſland is full. This is a Confirmation of what I have ſo often repeated, of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Trade carried on in this Part of the Iſland. This Croſs-poſt begins at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> in the South-weſt Part of <hi>England,</hi> and leaving the great
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0141100403:125"/>
Weſtern Poſt-road of <hi>Exceſter</hi> behind, comes away North to <hi>Taunton, Bridgwater,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi>; from thence goes on thro' all the great Cities and Towns up the <hi>Severn,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Glouceſter, Worceſter, Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,</hi> and <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> thence by <hi>Weſt Cheſter</hi> to <hi>Liverpool</hi> and <hi>Warrington,</hi> from whence it turns away Eaſt, and paſſes to <hi>Mancheſter, Bury, Rochdale, Halifax, Leeds,</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and ends at <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Means the Merchants at <hi>Hull</hi> have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Advice of their Ships which go out of the Chanel, and come in, by their Letters from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> as readily as the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> and without the double Charge of Poſtage. The Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers and Manufacturers can correſpond with their Dealers at <hi>Mancheſter, Liverpool,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> nay, even with <hi>Ireland</hi> directly, without the tedious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of ſending their Letters about by <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I followed this Poſt-road from <hi>Liverpool</hi> to <hi>Bury,</hi> both manufacturing Towns in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and the laſt very conſiderable for a Sort of coarſe Goods, called <hi>Half-thicks</hi> and <hi>Kerſies.</hi> The Market for them is very great, tho' the Town is ſituated ſo remote, ſo out of the way, and at the very Foot of the Mountains, that it would otherwiſe be but little frequented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rochdale,</hi> farther on in our Way to <hi>Black-ſtone Edge,</hi> is a good Market-town, and is of late very much improved in the Woollen Manufacture, as are alſo the Villages in its Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Here, for our great Encouragement, tho' it was but about the Middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and in ſome Places the Harveſt hardly got in, we ſaw the Mountains covered with Snow, and felt the Cold very acute and piercing; but we found, as in all thoſe Northern Countries, the People had a happy Way of mixing the Warm and the Cold together; for the Store of good Ale, which flows plentifully in the moſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Part of this Country, ſeems abundantly to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0141100403:126"/>
make up for all the Inclemencies of the Seaſon, or Difficulties of Travelling, adding alſo the Plenty of Coals for Firing, of which all thoſe Hills are full.</p>
            <p>We mounted the Hills, fortified with a little of this Precaution, early in the Morning; and tho' the Snow, which had fallen in the Night, lay a little upon the Ground, yet we thought it was not much; and the Morning being calm and clear, we had no Apprehenſion of an uneaſy Paſſage, neither did the People at <hi>Rochdale,</hi> who kindly directed us the Way, and even offered to guide us over the firſt Mountains, apprehend any Difficulty for us; ſo we complimented ourſelves out of their Aſſiſtance, which we afterwards very much wanted.</p>
            <p>For tho' the Sun ſhone when we came out of the Town of <hi>Rochdale,</hi> yet when we began to mount the Hills about a Mile from it, we found the Wind riſe, and the higher we went, the more it increaſed upon us; by which I ſoon perceived, that it had blown before, and perhaps all Night, upon the Hills, though it was calm below. And ſo we were obliged, in a moſt diſcouraging manner, to travel thro' track<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Drifts of Snow, and it continuing ſnowing too in our Faces, over <hi>Blackſtone Edge,</hi> we knew not whether we were wrong or right, till we perceived ſome Land-marks, that the honeſt <hi>Rochdale</hi> Men had told us of, which gave us great Comfort.</p>
            <p>But after we had paſſed this diſmal <hi>Edge,</hi> it was our conſtant Labour, as ſoon as we were at the Top of a Hill, to come down it again on the other Side, and then another Hill aroſe. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that there was one Bottom, that had any conſiderable Breadth of plain Ground in it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Brook in the Valley running from thoſe Gulls and Deeps between the Hills; and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that they always croſs'd our Way in the Bottoms from the Right-hand to the Left, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which you ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0141100403:127"/>From <hi>Blackſtone Edge</hi> to <hi>Halifax</hi> is eight Miles, and all the Way, except from <hi>Sorby</hi> to <hi>Halifax,</hi> is thus up Hill and down; ſo that, I ſuppoſe, we mounted to the Clouds, and deſcended to the Water-level, about eight times, in that little Part of the Journey.</p>
            <p>But now I muſt obſerve to you, that after we had paſſed the ſecond Hill, and come down into the Valley again, and ſo ſtill the nearer we came to <hi>Halifax,</hi> we found the Houſes thicker, and the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages greater, in every Bottom; and not only ſo, but the Sides of the Hills, which were very ſteep every way, were ſpread with Houſes; for the Land being divided into ſmall Incloſures, from two Acres to ſix or ſeven each, ſeldom more, every three or four Pieces of Land had a Houſe belonging to them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, after we had mounted the third Hill, we found the Country one continued Village, tho' every way mountainous, hardly a Houſe ſtanding out of a Speaking-diſtance from another; and as the Day cleared up, we could ſee at every Houſe a Tenter, and on almoſt every Tenter a Piece of Cloth, Kerſie, or Shalloon, which are the three Articles of this Country's Labour.</p>
            <p>In the Courſe of our Road among the Houſes, we found at every one of them a little Rill or Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of running Water; if the Houſe was above the Road, it came from it, and croſſed the Way to run to another; if the Houſe was below us, it croſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from ſome other diſtant Houſe above it; and at every conſiderable Houſe was a Manufactory, which not being able to be carried on without Water, theſe little Streams were ſo parted and guided by Gutters or Pipes, that not one of the Houſes wanted its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Appendage of a Rivulet.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Dying-houſes, Scouring-ſhops, and Places where they uſe this Water, emit it ting'd with the Drugs of the Dying-vat, and with the Oil, the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0141100403:128"/>
Soap, the Tallow, and other Ingredients uſed by the Clothiers in Dreſſing and Scouring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Lands thro' which it paſſes, which otherwiſe would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding barren, are enrich'd by it to a Degree beyond Imagination.</p>
            <p>Then, as every Clothier muſt neceſſarily keep one Horſe, at leaſt, to fetch home his Wooll and his Proviſions from the Market, to carry his Yarn to the Spinners, his Manufacture to the Fulling-mill, and, when finiſhed, to the Market to be ſold, and the like; ſo every one generally keeps a Cow or two for his Family. By this means, the ſmall Pieces of incloſed Land about each Houſe are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied; and by being thus fed, are ſtill farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved from the Dung of the Cattle. As for Corn, they ſcarce ſow enough to feed their Cocks and Hens.</p>
            <p>Such, it ſeems, has been the Bounty of Nature to this Country, that two Things eſſential to Life, and more particularly to the Buſineſs followed here, are found in it, and in ſuch a Situation, as is not to be met with in any Part of <hi>England,</hi> if in the World beſide: I mean, Coals and running Water on the Tops of the higheſt Hills. I doubt not but there are both Springs and Coals lower in theſe Hills; but were they to fetch them thence, 'tis probable the Pits would be too full of Water: 'tis eaſy, however, to fetch them from the upper Pits, the Horſes going light up, and coming down loaden. This Place then ſeems to have been deſigned by Providence for the very Purpoſes to which it is now allotted, for carrying on a Manufacture, which can no-where be ſo eaſily ſupplied with the Conveniencies neceſſary for it. Nor is the Induſtry of the People wanting to ſecond theſe Advantages. Tho' we met few People without Doors, yet within we ſaw the Houſes full of luſty Fellows, ſome at the Dye-vat, ſome at the Loom, others dreſſing the Cloths; the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0141100403:129"/>
Women and Children carding, or ſpinning; all imployed from the youngeſt to the oldeſt, ſcarce any thing above four Years old, but its Hands were ſufficient for its own Support. Not a Beggar to be ſeen, not an idle Perſon, except here and there in an Alms-houſe, built for thoſe that are antient and paſt working. The People in general live long; they enjoy a good Air, and under ſuch Circumſtances hard Labour is naturally attended with the Bleſſing of Health, if not Riches.</p>
            <p>From this Account, you'll eaſily imagine, that ſome of theſe remote Parts of the North are the moſt populous Places of <hi>Great Britain, London</hi> and its Neighbourhood excepted.</p>
            <p>We have all this while been in the Pariſh of <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> and before I come to the Town, I muſt add a Word or two of the River <hi>Calder,</hi> to complete the Deſcription of the Country I paſſed through. As I ſaid before, that all the Rills of Water which we croſſed, one at leaſt in every Bottom, went away to the Left or North Side of us, as we went Eaſtward, I am to add, that following thoſe little Brooks with our Eye, we could obſerve, that at ſome Diſtance to the Left there appeared a larger Valley than the reſt, into which not only all the Brooks which we paſſed emptied themſelves, but abundance more from the hollow deep Bottoms among the Hills on the North-ſide beyond it, which emptied this way South, as thoſe on our Side run that way North. And at the next Village, called <hi>Sorby,</hi> or <hi>Sowerby,</hi> we paſſed a conſiderable River (form'd from thoſe Brooks, and the melted Snows) over a ſtately Stone Bridge of ſeveral great Arches. And this was the main River <hi>Calder,</hi> which I mentioned at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> where it begins to be navigable, and which, without any Spring, may be called the Head of it.</p>
            <p>The ſame Obſervation will hold on moſt of the great Rivers in the North; there being hardly any
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0141100403:130"/>
that have their Beginning in any publick Springs or Lakes, as the Rivers in the South of <hi>England</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have; which is the Caſe particularly of the <hi>Derwent</hi> and the <hi>Don</hi> from the <hi>High Peak,</hi> and the Hills of the ſame Range more South of the <hi>Edge</hi>; of the <hi>Aire,</hi> the <hi>Wherfe,</hi> the <hi>Swale,</hi> the <hi>Eure,</hi> the <hi>Nyd,</hi> the <hi>Tees,</hi> and the <hi>Were,</hi> all in the ſame County of <hi>York</hi>; and the <hi>Tyne,</hi> the <hi>Cockett,</hi> the <hi>Till,</hi> and the <hi>Tweed,</hi> farther North; and even the <hi>Forth,</hi> the <hi>Tay,</hi> the <hi>Clyde,</hi> the <hi>Nyd,</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and the <hi>Merſee,</hi> the <hi>Ribble,</hi> the <hi>Rocke,</hi> and the <hi>Lune,</hi> the Weſt <hi>Calder,</hi> the <hi>Lowther,</hi> and the <hi>Eden,</hi> on the other Side of theſe Mountains, in <hi>Lancaſhire, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus accounted for them all at once, I ſhall only mention them now as they come in my way; for you will obſerve, I croſſed one or other of them at every conſiderable Town, all the Rivers as well in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> North of this Place, running from the middle of the Country where theſe Mountains riſe, either Eaſt into the <hi>German,</hi> or Weſt into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea. None of them run like the <hi>Severn,</hi> or the <hi>Wye,</hi> or the Rivers in South <hi>Wales,</hi> or the <hi>Exe</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> or the <hi>Avon</hi> in <hi>Wilts,</hi> or the <hi>Arun</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and others North and South. But I return to my Journey.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed the <hi>Calder</hi> at <hi>Sorby Bridge,</hi> I now came to the Town of <hi>Halifax,</hi> the moſt populous Pariſh or Vicarage in <hi>England</hi>; for it is but one, though 12 Miles in Diameter; but it has 12 or 13 Chapels of Eaſe, beſides about 16 Meeting-houſes, which they call alſo Chapels, being conformable in Faſhion to them, having Bells and Burying-ground to moſt of them, not reckoning thoſe of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> into the Number.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1443, there were but 30 Houſes in it; but in the next Century it was much increaſed: for Hiſtory tells us, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0141100403:131"/>
petition'd by the Inhabitants of <hi>Halifax,</hi> to grant them ſome Privileges, they ſet forth, as an Inſtance of their Loyalty, that no leſs than 12000 young Men went out armed from this one Pariſh, and, at her Majeſty's Call, joined her Troops to fight the Popiſh Army, then in Rebellion under the Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they then were ſo populous, what muſt they be now their Trade is ſo vaſtly inlarged by the great Demand of Kerſeys for cloathing the Armies abroad? Some maintain, that it is increaſed a fourth at leaſt within theſe 50 Years; from their having entred upon a Manufacture of Shalloons, which were never made in theſe Parts before, at leaſt, not in any Quantities; and 'tis computed, that 100,000 Pieces are work'd up in this Pariſh only; and yet they do not make much fewer Kerſeys than they did before; for I was aſſured, that there was one Dealer in the Vicarage, who traded, by Commiſſion, for 60000<hi>l.</hi> a Year in Kerſeys only, to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> And of late Years it is ſtill more increaſed, by the People of a neighbouring Part driving away about 4000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> Manufacturers, who with about 2000 others accompanying them, ſettled there. As the Vicarage is thus far extended, and ſo populous, what muſt the Market be which ſupplies this vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inhabitants? And yet theſe are all brought from other Parts of the Country. For as to Corn, they ſow little, and they feed very few Oxen or Sheep; and as they are ſurrounded with large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing Towns on every Side, all of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, like themſelves, in the Clothing Trade, they muſt neceſſarily have their Proviſions from other more diſtant Parts.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence then is plain; their Corn comes up in great Quantities out of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-riding</hi>; the Black Cattle from thence, and from <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>; Sheep and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0141100403:132"/>
Mutton from the adjacent Counties every way; Butter from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>North-ridings</hi>; and Cheeſe out of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Markets in the Months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> are prodigiouſly thronged, that being the Time when the Clothiers buy up as many Oxen as will ſerve their Family for the whole Year, which they uſed to drive Home, kill, ſalt, and hang up in the Smoke to dry. This was heretofore their common Diet, but now they live more upon freſh Meats.</p>
            <p>Thus one trading manufacturing Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a barren Soil, gives and receives Support from all the Countries round it.</p>
            <p>There is nothing extraordinary in the Town itſelf; but the Multitude of People who reſort to it on a Market-day, as well to ſell their Manufactures, as to buy Proviſions, is prodigious: in this reſpect no Places equal it in all the North Part of <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Leeds</hi> and <hi>Wakefield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church is old, but ſtately and venerable, and has in it many extraordinary Monuments, but moſt of them of great Antiquity. Here is a very good Hoſpital, and a Work-houſe of an antient Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and there are ſeveral Charities of like Sort, in different Parts of the Pariſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Halifax</hi> gave Birth to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Halifax,</hi> or <hi>de Sacro Boſco,</hi> the chief Mathematician of his Age, who was buried at the publick Expence of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi>; and to the late Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of true rational Preaching; tho' a new Sect, lately ſprung up, called <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> with great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and intolerable <hi>Conceit</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> at preſent ſeek publickly to depreciate the Memory and Works of that truly great Man.</p>
            <p>The Courſe of Juſtice antiently made uſe of here to prevent the ſtealing of Cloth, is very remarkable. Modern Authors pretend to ſay it was for all Sorts
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0141100403:133"/>
of Felons; but I am well aſſured, it was firſt erected purely, or at leaſt principally, for ſuch Thieves as were detected in ſtealing Cloth from the Tenters: and it ſeems very reaſonable to think it was ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Conditions of the Trial. The following is a brief Account of it:</p>
            <p>The Woollen Manufacture was erected here about the Year 1480, when King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. cauſed an Act to paſs prohibiting the Exportation of unwrought Wooll, and to encourage foreign Manufacturers to ſettle in <hi>England</hi>; ſeveral of whom coming over, eſtabliſhed different Manufactures of Cloths in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of the Kingdom, as that of Bays at <hi>Colcheſter.</hi> Says at <hi>Sudbury,</hi> Broad-cloth in <hi>Wilts,</hi> and other Counties; and the Trade of Kerſeys and narrow Cloth at this Place, and other adjacent Towns. And as, at the Time when this Trade began, nothing was more frequent than for young Workmen to leave their Cloths out all Night upon Tenters, which gave an Opportunity for the idle Fellows to ſteal them, a ſevere Law was made againſt ſtealing Cloth, which gave the Power of Life and Death into the Hands of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Halifax.</hi> But this Law was extended to no other Crime; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, as I have ſaid, intimate as much: for the Power was not given to the Magiſtrates to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, unleſs in one of theſe three plain Caſes:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Hand Napping,</hi> that is, when the Criminal was taken in the very Fact.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Back Bearing,</hi> that is, when the Cloth was found upon him.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Tongue Confeſſing,</hi> which needs no Explanation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Fact likewiſe was to be committed within the Liberties or Precincts of the Foreſt of <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>; and the Value of the Goods ſtolen was to be above thirteen Pence Halfpeny.</p>
            <p>When the Criminal was taken, he was brought before the Magiſtrates of the Town, and they judged,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0141100403:134"/>
ſentenced, and executed the Offender, or cleared him, within ſo many Days; I think it was three Market Days. If the Offence was committed out of the Vicarage, but within the Bounds of the Foreſt, then there were <hi>Frith Bourgers</hi> alſo to judge of the Fact, who were to be ſummoned out of the <hi>Foreſt Holders,</hi> as they are called, who were to hold of that Frith, that is, of the Foreſt. If they acquitted him of the Fact, he was immediately diſcharged; if they condemned him, nobody could reprieve him but the Town. The Country People were, it ſeems, ſo terrified at the Severity of this Proceeding, that hence came that Proverbial Litany, which was uſed all over <hi>Yorkſhire:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>From</hi> Hell, Hull, <hi>and</hi> Halifax,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Good Lord, deliver us.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hull</hi> was included in this Petition, on account of their rigid Diſcipline to Beggars; for they whipt out the foreign Poor, and ſet their own to work.</p>
            <p>The Manner of Execution was very remarkable, by an Ax drawn up by a Pulley, and faſtened with a Pin to the Side of a Wooden Engine, which when pulled out, the Axe fell ſwiftly down, and did its Office.</p>
            <p>The Engine is now gone, but the Baſis on which it ſtood ſtill remains, being a ſquare Foundation of Stone, to which you go up by Steps. The Engine was removed, as we were told, in the Year 1620, during the Reign of K. <hi>James</hi> I.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of the ſame Prince, the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> paſſing thro' <hi>Halifax,</hi> and ſeeing one of theſe Executions, cauſed a Model to be taken, and carried into his own Country, where it is made uſe of at this Day. But his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's own Head was the firſt that was cut off with it; and it being many Years before that happened, the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0141100403:135"/>
Engine got the Name of the <hi>Maiden,</hi> before it was handſelled by the Execution of the Earl; and this it retains, tho' it has cut off many a Head ſince.</p>
            <p>The Ways to <hi>Halifax</hi> uſed to be exceedingly bad, and, except at the Weſt Entrance, almoſt inacceſſible; but of late Years they have been much mended; and ſeveral Acts of Parliament have paſſed very lately, which will greatly increaſe the Conveniences of the People thereabouts, as well as improve its Commerce and Communication all around it, to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> as well as to <hi>Leeds, Doncaſter,</hi> and all the great trading Towns, even to the City of <hi>York</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>Due Eaſt from <hi>Halifax,</hi> is <hi>Kirkley,</hi> a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, ſituated on the <hi>Calder,</hi> near which is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the famous <hi>Robin Hood</hi>; and upon the Moor, his <hi>Butts,</hi> Two little Hills, ſo called, about a Quarter of a Mile aſunder. I have now traced this Hero from the Foreſt of <hi>Shirwood,</hi> the Scene of his Exploits, to his Grave. I before doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ever was ſuch an one; but Epitaphs, as great Liars as they are, I ſuppoſe, are Evidence that ſuch a Man once exiſted. His is as follows:
<q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Near this Place is a little Town, called <hi>Burſtall,</hi> where they make Broad Cloth, ſo called in Diſtinction from Kerſeys and Druggets, and the like, tho' the Cloths in this Country are called Narrow, when they are ſpoken of in <hi>London,</hi> and compared with the Broad Cloths made in <hi>Wilts, Glouceſter, Somerſet,</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town is famed for Dying, and there are made here a ſort of Cloth in Imitation of <hi>Glouceſter Whites,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0141100403:136"/>
which, tho' they may not be ſo fine, yet their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are as good.</p>
            <p>From hence to <hi>Leeds,</hi> and every way round, the Country appears exceedingly buſy and diligent. The Houſes are not ſcatter'd and diſperſed, as in the Pariſh of <hi>Halifax,</hi> but crouded up in large Villages, and thronged with People.</p>
            <p>A few Miles South-weſt of <hi>Halifax</hi> is <hi>Huthersfield,</hi> upon the <hi>Calder,</hi> which is the firſt noted Town it comes to. This Town is one of the Five, where that vaſt Clothing-trade, which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is carried on. They have a Market here for Kerſeys every <hi>Tueſday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I am ſpeaking of their Manufactures, I muſt not forget that very eſſential one, called <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire Ale,</hi> which indeed is in its Perfection in all this Part of the County. But I cannot paſs over <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield</hi> without taking notice of its old Neighbour, <hi>Almondbury,</hi> a famous Town in the Time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and called <hi>Campodunum</hi>; but 'tis now a Village only. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls it a Royal Town; and ſays, it had a Cathedral Church in it, dedicated to St. <hi>Alban,</hi> from whom it was called <hi>Albanbury,</hi> whence its preſent Name. The Ruins of a Stone Caſtle and Rampire are ſtill to be ſeen near it.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Calder</hi> having been made navigable to <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and great Benefit ariſing from it, it is now [<hi>Ann.</hi> 1741.] about to be made further navigable, to the Towns of <hi>Ealand</hi> and <hi>Halifax</hi>; which will be of inexpreſſible Service to thoſe populous and improving Places, and all the Villages and Towns adjacent. And as there have juſt paſſed new Acts to mend the Road from <hi>Selby</hi> to <hi>Leeds, Bradford,</hi> and <hi>Halifax,</hi> and from <hi>Ealand</hi> to <hi>Leeds,</hi> which have been torn in Pieces by the heavy Carriages paſſing to and fro in the carrying on the vaſt extended Trade of thoſe Parts; 'tis hardly to be conceived what Benefit will accrue from theſe publick Works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0141100403:137"/>The firſt Town we came to from <hi>Halifax,</hi> was <hi>Bradford.</hi> It has a Market; but is of no other Note than having given Birth to Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> the good Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſoon enter'd <hi>Craven,</hi> which is a very hilly and craggy Country, as the Name ſignifies; for <hi>Craven</hi> comes from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Craig,</hi> a Rock. But, however unpleaſant,</p>
            <p>We proceeded farther North-weſt, and arrived at <hi>Skipton,</hi> a good well-built Town, encompaſſed with Hills on every Side. The Market is well frequented and ſupplied. Here is a large handſome Church, and a good Grammar School; to which one Mr. <hi>Petyt,</hi> who had been principal of <hi>Bernard</hi>'s-<hi>Inn, London,</hi> gave a conſiderable Parcel of Books, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe erected a good Library in the Church. We were agreeably ſurpriſed to find ſo handſome a Town, and ſuch good Accommodations in ſo mountainous a Country.</p>
            <p>This is a healthy Country however, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants live to a great Age: a Father and Son giving Evidence at the Aſſizes at <hi>York,</hi> it appeared the firſt was 140, and the Son 100 Years old.</p>
            <p>Here the Road turns almoſt due Weſt, which brought us to a Town called <hi>Settle,</hi> a much better Town than we expected in ſuch a Country. It lies on the Road to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> at the Foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which part that County from <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> upon the River <hi>Ribble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a little lower, upon the ſame River, upon the Borders of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> ſtands <hi>Giſborne,</hi> but has nothing remarkable in it.</p>
            <p>Looking forwards, to the North-weſt of us, we ſaw nothing but high Mountains, which had a terrible Aſpect, and more frightful than any in <hi>Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> or <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Pingent Hill,</hi> which <hi>Camden</hi> derives from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Pengwin,</hi> i. e. <hi>White-head,</hi> from the Snow lying upon it: ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0141100403:138"/>
that having no manner of Inclination to encounter them, merely for the ſake of ſeeing only a few Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and a Parcel of wild People, we turned ſhort North-eaſt, and came to the great Road leading Northward to <hi>Richmond,</hi> at a Village called <hi>Brum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal,</hi> noted for the Birth of Sir <hi>William Craven,</hi> an Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> who was a great Founder and Builder of Churches, Bridges, Cauſways, and other publick Edifices in this Country.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed thro' ſome other inconſiderable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, we enter'd <hi>Midlam,</hi> a little Market-town on the River <hi>Youre,</hi> and the North-riding of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> together, and ſo leaving <hi>Maſham,</hi> another inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Market-town, which lay upon the ſame River, to the South-eaſt of us, we paſſed along to <hi>Bedal,</hi> which is likewiſe of no great Note, ſaving that the Living is worth 500<hi>l.</hi> a Year, and that we met here again the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſway, which leads up through <hi>Richmond</hi> to <hi>Barnards Caſtle,</hi> in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and is called <hi>Leeming-lane</hi> for 20 Miles together. We put ourſelves upon this Way, and were not long before we arrived at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' I met with nothing elſe within the Town of <hi>Bedal</hi> worth obſerving, yet the Country round it, as indeed the whole County, is more or leſs full of Jockies, and Dealers in Horſes; and the Breed in this, and the next County, is ſo well known, that tho' the Pedigree of them is not preſerved for a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Ages, as 'tis ſaid they do in <hi>Arabia,</hi> yet are their Stallions denominated by certain Names, that never fail to advance the Price of a Horſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Reputation of the Sire he comes of.</p>
            <p>And indeed, let Foreigners boaſt what they will of <hi>Barbs</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſes, or of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jennets from <hi>Cordoua,</hi> for which 500<hi>l.</hi> apiece have been given, I believe that ſome of the Gallopers of this County, and of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> which joins to it, will out-do, for Speed and Strength, the ſwifteſt Horſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0141100403:139"/>
that was ever bred in <hi>Turkey</hi> or <hi>Barbary,</hi> take both Advantages together. For tho' the <hi>Barb</hi> may beat <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> for a Mile Courſe, <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> ſhall diſtance him at the End of the Four Miles; the <hi>Barb</hi> ſhall carry the Day with Seven and a half, but <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> with 12 and 14 Stone. In a word, <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> ſhall carry the Man, and the <hi>Barb</hi> a Feather. But they are univerſally allowed to be the beſt Hunting and Road Horſes in the World; and are bought up by Foreigners on that Account.</p>
            <p>As this Part of the Country is ſo much imployed in Horſes, the young Fellows are bred up in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and make excellent Grooms.</p>
            <p>Beſides their Fame for Horſes, they have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation alſo of being good Grafiers over this whole Country, and produce a large, noble Breed of Oxen, as may be ſeen at <hi>North Allerton</hi> Fairs, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Numbers of them are bought Eight times every Year, and brought Southward as far as the Fens in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Ely,</hi> where they are fed up to the Groſſneſs of Fat we ſee in <hi>London</hi> Markets. The Market theſe North Country Cattle are generally brought to, is at <hi>St. Ives,</hi> a Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon the River <hi>Ouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richmond</hi> is ſo called from its Situation upon a Hill or Mount, fruitful, tho' the Country about it is rocky and barren; and it gives the Name of <hi>Richmondſhire</hi> to the Diſtrict it is in, as another, Eaſt of this, is called <hi>Allertonſhire:</hi> the former is in the Dioceſe of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and the latter in that of <hi>Durham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town, in the Time of <hi>Richard</hi> II. was annexed to the Duchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and ſo ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. Earl <hi>Edwin</hi> built a Caſtle here, the Tower o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which is ſtill ſtanding; as is alſo the Steeple of the old Priory. It is a Borough governed by a Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and holds Pleas in all kinds of Action; has a good Market-place, and Three Gates, which lead to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0141100403:140"/>
Three different Suburbs. It is well built all of Stone, and ſome Houſes of Free-ſtone.</p>
            <p>We were told, That in the Year 1732, Mr. <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Agent to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> by ordering ſeveral Places here to be dug very deep, diſcovered the Draw-bridge and Moat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Richmond</hi> Caſtle, which were of very curious Workmanſhip.</p>
            <p>Here thrives a kind of Manufactory of knit Yarn Stockens for Servants, and ordinary People. Every Family is imployed that way, both great and ſmall; and here you may buy the ſmalleſt ſized Stockens for Children for 1<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> the Dozen Pair, ſometimes leſs.</p>
            <p>This Trade extends itſelf alſo into <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> or rather from <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> hither: for at <hi>Kendal, Kirkby-Stephen,</hi> and ſuch other Places in this County as border upon <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the chief Manufacture of Yarn Stockens is carried on, which is indeed a very conſiderable one, and of late greatly increaſed.</p>
            <p>We made ſome Excurſions from this Town into the Country round it, and followed the River <hi>Swal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Weſt, which runs under the Wall of the Caſtle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and, by reaſon of Rocks, which intercept its Paſſage, forms here a natural Cataract. This River, tho' not extraordinary large, is noted for giving Name to the Lands which it runs through for ſome Length, called <hi>Swale Dale,</hi> and to an antient Family of that Name; the laſt of whom was Sir <hi>Solomon Swale,</hi> Bart. who wrote himſelf of <hi>Swale Hall,</hi> in <hi>Swale Dale,</hi> by the River <hi>Swale.</hi> This Gentleman became unfortunate, and was ſupplanted by a Perſon not long ſince dead, who was a Clerk in the Exchequer Office; and obſerving this Family held their Eſtate of the Crown, and that they had omitted to renew for many Years, procured a Grant from the Crown, of this Eſtate for himſelf. A great many Law-ſuits enſued; but to no other Effect
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0141100403:141"/>
than to increaſe the Misfortunes of this Gentleman, who died a Priſoner in the Fleet, but, I think, not till his Adverſary had firſt made away with himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Swale Dale</hi> is a low, pleaſant, and rich Valley, abounding with Graſs, but very bare of Wood; tho' here is a Place juſt by, called <hi>Swale Dale Foreſt:</hi> it might have been ſo antiently, but there are hardly Trees enough in it now to denominate it a Foreſt.</p>

               </gap>es that <hi>England</hi> ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; I mean <hi>Henry Jenkins,</hi> whoſe remarkable great Age deſerves our particular Notice: He was born in the Year 1500, and died in 1670, being then 169 Years of Age. There are no Regiſters of ſo long a Date, and therefore his Age muſt be gueſſed at by other Circumſtances, either from his own Account, or the probable Evidences of others. Which are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Being demanded by a Gentlewoman, who was curious to know, as exactly as poſſible how old he was, What Kings he remembred; he anſwered, after a little Pauſe,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he thought himſelf about 162 or 163 Years old; and that he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Plowden</hi> (meaning <hi>Floddon</hi>) <hi>Field,</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.'s Reign."</q>
She then aſk'd him:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Was the King himſelf there?"</q>
He replied,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No; he was in <hi>France,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> was General."</q>
She aſked him then, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How old he was then?"</q> He ſaid,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0141100403:142"/>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"About 12 Years old."</q> That Battle was fought <hi>September</hi> 9. 1513; King <hi>Henry</hi> being then at <hi>Tournay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There were Four or Five of the ſame Pariſh, at that time, of an 100 Years old or very near it, who all declared, That they never knew him any other than an elderly Man; and that he told them he was Butler to the Lord <hi>Coniers.</hi> The laſt of that Name died without Iſſue 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> I. <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1557. And he remembred the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Fountains,</hi> before the Diſſolution in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.'s Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He went often to the Aſſizes on Foot; and was uſed as a Witneſs in other Courts, whoſe Records ſpeak largely of his Age. In the <hi>Chancery</hi> he was ſworn, to the Remembrance of above 140 Years; and as much, often, at <hi>York</hi> Aſſizes. In the King's <hi>Remembrancer's Office</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> a Record ſaith,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That <hi>Henry Jenkins,</hi> Labourer, aged 157 Years, depoſed, as a Witneſs, in 1665; and, to confirm his Age, divers antient Men, who were Witneſſes, ſwore that he was a very old Man when they firſt knew him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He was, for the laſt Century of his Life, a Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and uſed to wade and ſwim in the Rivers even after he was an hundred Years old, and lived upon very coarſe Diet. In ſome of his laſt Years, being unable to work at his Trade, he went a begging to Gentlemens Houſes, who uſed to relieve him chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as a great Curioſity. And his great Age was the more to be credited, becauſe he could neither write nor read: and ſo, what he reported, was from Strength of Memory Two Years before his Death, he was able to bind Sheaves after the Reapers, and had his Sight and Hearing to the laſt.</p>
            <p>The next Excurſion we made was up to the Banks of the <hi>Tees,</hi> thro' <hi>Gilling, Eggleſton,</hi> and <hi>Bowes,</hi> now ordinary Towns, or rather Villages; tho' the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0141100403:143"/>
firſt had, formerly, a great Caſtle; which, in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Time, and long afterwards, was the Seat of the Lords of that Country; whereas <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> which has ſince roſe out of the Ruins of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> was but a Fort, and in Subordination to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eggleſton</hi> is famous for Marble, which they dig out of the Rocks there, and imploys a great many Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bowes</hi> ſtands upon the Military <hi>Roman</hi> Way, and has been therefore, undoubtedly, a Place of great Note.</p>
            <p>In this Part of <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> and up Northward, are no leſs than Three Foreſts, viz. <hi>Applegarth</hi> Foreſt, <hi>New</hi> Foreſt, and <hi>Lune</hi> Foreſt; and all theſe within a Tract of Ground of no great Extent. Not far off is, beſides, the Foreſt of <hi>Swale Dale,</hi> before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tees</hi> is famous for Salmon, and is a rapid River, and ſometimes ſwells up ſo ſuddenly, that a Man, in paſſing the Ford, in the Road to <hi>Darlington,</hi> on Foot, whilſt the Water was low, and hardly up to his Knees, was overtaken, as he was going over, by a ſudden Swell of the Stream, and carried off and drown'd. The People this way talk much of an antient City they had formerly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. The Antiquaries agree, there was one called by the <hi>Romans, Cataractonium,</hi> but differ as to its Situation; but, I think, Mr. <hi>Salmon</hi> has placed it moſt probably upon the Confluences of the <hi>Tees</hi> and <hi>Greta,</hi> at a Place called <hi>Merton</hi>; where indeed the Remains of it are very viſible; and alſo about <hi>Greta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which is juſt by it.</p>
            <p>We croſſed the River, and entered <hi>Bernard's-caſtle,</hi> which lies on the North Side of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently within the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham.</hi> It was built by the Grandfather of <hi>Baliol,</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and is an antient well-built Town, but not large. Here they have an excellent Art of dreſſing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0141100403:144"/>
their Hides into Leather, out of which they make the beſt Bridles, Reins, and Belts; as at <hi>Rippon</hi> they were wont to furniſh you with the beſt Spurs and Stirrups.</p>
            <p>The Manufacture for Stockens continues thus far, and flouriſhes here and at <hi>Marwood,</hi> and other little Villages on the Borders of <hi>Durham</hi>; but the Jockey-trade extends much farther.</p>
            <p>Between this Part of the Biſhoprick where this Town ſtands, on the Eaſt, and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> on the Weſt, a mountainous Tract of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> runs, like a Promontory, up Northward a great way, Hill upon upon Hill, Cliffs, Rocks, and terrible Precipices, moſt aſtoniſhing to behold. This rugged Part of the Country is called <hi>Stanmore Hills,</hi> which are deſolate and ſolitary, excepting one Inn, for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as may be hardy enough to go among them. As for us, we did not think it worth our while. But here are, it ſeems, abundance of the Frolicks of Nature in Stone, which exactly reſemble Serpents, and other various Forms.</p>
            <p>The Weſt Side of the Biſhoprick being very mountainous too, and correſponding with that of <hi>Stanmore,</hi> we turned North-eaſt, to viſit a little Market-town, but a little way off, called <hi>Stainthorp</hi>; but being of no other Note than having a ſtately Tomb in the Church to the Memory of one of the <hi>Nevils,</hi> and his two Wives, we paſſed on to <hi>Raby</hi> Caſtle, which ſtands juſt by it, the antient Seat of that Family; but now of the Lord <hi>Vane.</hi> But it has nothing remarkable in it.</p>
            <p>We came next to <hi>Piers-bridge,</hi> to which the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſway leads, or, as they call it, <hi>Leeming-lane.</hi> Here have been many remarkable Remains of Antiquity dug up, and particularly an old Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. We thought to have returned by this Bridge into <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>; but were deſirous to take in <hi>Darling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> firſt, and paſs over the <hi>Tees</hi> there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0141100403:145"/>
               <hi>Darlington</hi> is remarkable for its dirty Situation; for a beautiful Church, with a high Spire riſing up from the Midſt of it; and for a good long Stone Bridge, over very little or no Water. It is a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Market-town of great Reſort, and well ſupplied. The Market-place is large and convenient. It is noted for the Linen Manufacture, as the Water of the <hi>Skern,</hi> on which it is ſituated, is exceeding good for Bleeching, inſomuch that Linen has been ſent hither from <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bleech; but it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly excels in Huggabags of Ten Quarters wide, which are made no-where elſe in <hi>England</hi>; and of which, as well as other Linen-cloth, it ſends up large Quantities to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A greater Rarity, I may mention in this Town, was our Landlord, at the <hi>Fleece</hi> Inn, by Name <hi>Henry Lovell,</hi> who died in <hi>May</hi> 1739, in the 93d Year of his Age, and had kept this Inn ever ſince 1688. He was never known to have one Hour's Sickneſs, nor even the Head-ach, tho' a free Toper of Ale, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for Days and Nights ſucceſſively, but had an Averſion to Drams of all kinds, retained his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sight and Memory, to his laſt Moments. He never made uſe of Spectacles, nor ever loſt a Tooth. He was eſteemed in his Life, and lamented at his Death, being of a humane Temper, and had the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Oxehall,</hi> near this Town, we ſaw the famous <hi>Hell Kettles</hi>; which are Three deep Pits full of Water; which have occaſioned many fabulous Stories among the Country-people, and divers Conjectures among the Learned; but they ſeem to be nothing elſe but old Coal pits (and yet there is no Coal near them now) filled by the Water of the <hi>Tees,</hi> thro' ſome ſubterraneous Paſſage, as 'tis ſaid, Biſhop <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal</hi> experienced, by marking a Gooſe, and putting her into one of the Pits; which he found next Day in the <hi>Tees.</hi> Others ſay, they were occaſioned by an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0141100403:146"/>
Earthquake, which is recorded in the Chronicle of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> for the Year 1179, when the Earthquake happened.</p>
            <p>We paſſed on Eaſt, and came to <hi>Yarum</hi> Bridge, where we re-croſſed the <hi>Tees.</hi> It is a very good and well-built Bridge. The Town is incorporated, and but ſmall, lying near the Influx of the little River <hi>Levan</hi> into the <hi>Tees.</hi> It has ſeen much better Days; but, however, of late Years, it is a little recovered, and carries a pretty Trade, by Water, for Lead, Corn, and Butter, with <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stokeſby</hi> is alſo but a ſmall Market-town, and ſtands near the Source of the ſame River, a few Miles Eaſt of <hi>Yarum,</hi> inland; which lies in a little Tract of rich and fruitful Ground, called <hi>Allertonſhire,</hi> and water'd by the River <hi>Wyſk.</hi> It is a corporate Town, conſiſting of one Street, about half a Mile long, well-built, with a very good Market; and is noted for having the greateſt Beaſt-fair in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was a bloody Battle fought, in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Time, between <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Tunſtall,</hi> who was Lieutenant in theſe Parts for King <hi>Stephen,</hi> which was called <hi>the Battle of the Standard</hi>; which, it ſeems, never uſed to be erected but when the Kingdom was in imminent danger. The Biſhop prevailed, and routed the <hi>Scots,</hi> tho' <hi>Henry,</hi> King <hi>David</hi>'s Son, kept the Field of Battle with a Band of hardy Soldiers, after the Bulk of the Army was fled, with their King after them; and fought valiantly, till he was overpower'd, and oblig'd to follow his Father.</p>
            <p>From hence we advanced ſtill South, and paſſed thro' <hi>Thirſk,</hi> a corporate Town, which has but an ordinary Market, to <hi>Aldborough</hi> and <hi>Borough-brigg,</hi> which lie within Three Miles of <hi>Rippon</hi> upon the River <hi>Eure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are Two Borough Towns, each ſending Two Members to Parliament, which is a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0141100403:147"/>
peculiar to this Place, and to <hi>Weymouth</hi> and <hi>Melcomb</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Borough-brigg,</hi> or <hi>Bridge,</hi> ſeems to be the modern Town riſen up out of <hi>Aldborough,</hi> the very Names importing as much, the one being <hi>Borough at the Bridge,</hi> and the other <hi>Old Borough,</hi> that was before it. All the Antiquaries are agreed in this, who place on the Side of <hi>Aldborough,</hi> or <hi>Old Borough,</hi> an antient City, and <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, called <hi>Iſurium Brigantium.</hi> At preſent there are not ſo much as the Ruins of a City to be ſeen above Ground. But the Coins, Urns, Vaults, Pavements, and the like, frequently dug up there, give Evidence to the Thing; and ſome of them are ſo very remarkable, that I cannot chuſe to refer you to Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> and his Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuator, for farther Satisfaction: only adding to what they have obſerved, that a curious Piece of Antiquity was diſcover'd a few Years ago; which is a Moſaick Pavement of ſingular Form and Beauty, brought to light on digging the Foundation of a Houſe, and which is now about Two Feet from the Level of the Street.</p>
            <p>At the Door of the College is another teſſelated Pavement of a different Form from the other, and tho' not above Three Yards from it, it is a Foot nearer the Surface of the Street. The former is compoſed of white and black Squares, with a Border of red; but the Stones of this are leſſer Squares, and are white, yellow, red, and blue.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince more Pavements of this kind were diſcover'd on an Eminence called <hi>Borough-hill</hi>; as alſo the Foundations of a conſiderable Building; two Baſes of Pillars of ſome regular Order; large Stones of the grit Kind, with Joints for Cramping; ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Veſſels; Flews for Conveyance of Smoke, or warm Air; Bones and Horns of Beaſts, moſtly Stags; an Ivory Needle; and a Copper <hi>Roman Stylus:</hi> from all which it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0141100403:148"/>
that a Temple formerly ſtood in this Place. I had not ſo much Curioſity as to go to ſee the Three great pyramidal Stones in the Fields on the Left-hand, as you go thro' <hi>Borough-bridge,</hi> which the Country People, being unable to comprehend how they came there, will have to be brought by the Devil, and ſo call them <hi>The Devil's Arrows.</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> deſcribes them, as alſo does Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Antiquities of</hi> York, to whom therefore I refer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Borough-bridge,</hi> the lateſt built of the two Towns I have mentioned, is undoubtedly very old; for here, in the Barons Wars, was a Battle; and on this Bridge the great <hi>Humphrey de Bohun,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> was killed by a Soldier, who lay concealed under the Bridge, and wounded him, by thruſting a Spear or Pike, thro' a Chink, into his Body, as he was paſſing over it. From whence we may conclude, with Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> that it was a Timber Bridge then, and not built of Stone, as it is now.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Borough-brigg</hi> the Battle was fought between King <hi>Edward</hi> II. and his Barons, who were defeated, and after enſued the bloody Execution at <hi>Pontefract,</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and others of the Barons, as I mentioned when I ſpoke of <hi>Pontefract.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Two Borough Towns lying near the Centre of this vaſt County, and on the Skirts of the North and Weſt Ridings, and there being a great many Towns about the Middle of the firſt, that we could not more conveniently viſit than from hence; we therefore ſtruck away Eaſt, and North-eaſt, through the Towns of <hi>Hovingham, Rydell, Hemeſley,</hi> and <hi>Kirkby Moore Side</hi>; which is ſo called becauſe it lies on the Side of <hi>Blackamoore.</hi> But they were far from anſwering our Trouble of going ſo far out of the Way, (excepting that <hi>Hemeſley</hi> ſeemed to be tolerably well-built with Stone, and the Houſes covered with Slate) the Two firſt having hardly a Market. But the Situation of <hi>Rydell</hi> is pleaſant,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0141100403:149"/>
being in a fine fruitful Vale, wherein are 23 Pariſh-churches.</p>
            <p>We then turned South-eaſt, and came to <hi>Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> a pretty large well-built Town, which has a well-furniſhed Market, and belongs to the Duchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> having Juriſdiction over ſeveral neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Villages, and is called, <hi>The Honour of Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> It has formerly been a fortified Place, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Ruins of a Caſtle, which lie upon a Hill.</p>
            <p>It is ſituate on the Weſt Side of a wild hilly Country, and a Foreſt which is within the Liberty of the Town, and called <hi>Pickering Foreſt</hi>; which we did not care to traverſe over, and ſo paſſed South-weſt down to <hi>Malton</hi> on the <hi>Derwent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town is divided into Two Parts, by the River, which are called <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Malton.</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> is the <hi>Camalodunum</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was burnt by <hi>Thurſtan,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Cauſe, againſt <hi>Euſtace,</hi> the Lord of it, who had betray'd Part of this Country into the Hands of the <hi>Scots</hi>; but <hi>Euſtace,</hi> being afterwards received into Favour, rebuilt it, and it has been ever ſince called <hi>New Malton.</hi> Here has been a famous Abbey, and the Church of it is ſtill ſtanding, but very ruinous, tho' the Caſtle is quite demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>This Town is well-built and inhabited, and has Two well-ſupplied weekly Markets, which are held by Preſcription; for it is not incorporated. It is the beſt Market in the County for Horſes, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Proviſions; and is noted for Utenſils in Huſbandry. It has likewiſe Three handſome Pariſh Churches, and a good Stone Bridge over the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went.</hi> Near this Town is a Well, whoſe Water is ſaid to have the ſame Virtue as that of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſet out from hence, and for ſome Miles coaſted along the Banks of <hi>Derwent</hi> towards <hi>York,</hi> taking
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0141100403:150"/>
               <hi>Hinderſkell</hi> in our Way, where the late Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> built the magnificent Seat of <hi>Caſtle How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> upon the Spot of Ground where the old Caſtle ſtood, in the middle of a Wood; but his Lordſhip died before it was finiſh'd. I ſhall mention this again by-and-by.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not omit, that on the South-ſide of the <hi>Derwent,</hi> we ſaw <hi>Auldby,</hi> a little Village, where, 'tis ſaid, ſtood, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Times, a City called <hi>Derventis,</hi> where a Company named <hi>Derventienſes</hi> was ſtation'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Derwent</hi> is a River very full of Water, and overflows its Banks, and all the neighbouring Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, always after Rain. It is likewiſe well-ſtock'd with Fiſh, and runs between the Eaſt and North Ridings.</p>
            <p>We are now entering the great City of <hi>York,</hi> the <hi>Eboracum</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of ſuch Account in their Time, that no leſs than Three Military Ways paſs'd thro' it; and it was not only a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, but the Seat of ſome of the Emperors, and principal Generals, particularly of <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Conſtantine the Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Approach to it we diſcovered many viſible Marks of Antiquity, not reducible to Deſcription; and tho' Time and Misfortunes have ſo deeply effaced all Traces of its once glorious Splendor, yet ſome noble Remains of Majeſty are ſtill to be ſeen there, eſpecially as we viewed it from a riſing Hill at ſome ſmall Diſtance on the <hi>London</hi> Road: nay, after we were within the Walls, and had Leiſure to look about, we found ourſelves not diſappointed in the Idea we had before conceived of it; and every Traveller, who is inquiſitive in the Search of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities or Curioſities, will be tempted to make ſome Stay at <hi>York</hi>; there being a very great Variety of each to detain and amuſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0141100403:151"/>Among the former I ſhall only mention the Arch at <hi>Micklegate-bar,</hi> and the multangular Tower and Wall, near a Place called the <hi>Mint-yard,</hi> both built in the Time of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But whether the Two Statues now proſtrate on the Wall of St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Church-yard,</hi> be <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> is hard to determine: certain it is, that the ſepulchral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the Standard-bearer to the Ninth Legion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was dug up near <hi>Micklegate</hi>; and in other Parts of the City have been found many <hi>Roman</hi> Altars, Inſcriptions, Urns, Coins and the like, now in the Poſſeſſion of the Curious.</p>
            <p>I do not include the Ruins of Abbeys, Churches and Caſtles, now to be ſeen in this Place, among the Antiquities of it, becauſe they are but of a late Date, compared with the antient Remains, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Skill and Grandeur, and becauſe they would take up more Time and Room than the Nature of my Work will allow.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>York</hi> is ſurrounded by a ſtrong Wall, kept in good Repair, in which are four Gates, and five Poſterns. It is a County of itſelf, extending ever all the <hi>Wapontake,</hi> called <hi>Ainſty,</hi> and is governed by a Mayor, who is ſtyled Lord, as at <hi>London,</hi> a Recorder, 12 Aldermen, in Commiſſion of the Peace, two Sheriffs, 24 Prime Common-council Men, eight Chamberlains, 72 Common-council Men, a Town-clerk, Sword-bearer, and Common Sergeant; and the Mayor and Aldermen have Conſervation of the Rivers <hi>Ouze, Humber, Wherſe, Derwent, Air,</hi> and <hi>Dun,</hi> within certain Limits of each.</p>
            <p>This City always gives Title to the ſecond Prince of the Blood Royal, and the two Citizens they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Parliament, have a Privilege of taking their Places in the Houſe of Commons, next the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> upon what is called the Privy Counſellor's Bench; a Privilege which, if neglected to be claimed, ought to be made known, as it appertains to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0141100403:152"/>
Citizens of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York</hi> only, and is by thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> exerciſed the firſt Day of the Meeting of every new Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Situation of <hi>York</hi> is in a Plain on both Sides the River <hi>Ouſe.</hi> It was formerly very populous, and had a great Trade; but has declined ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the Difuſe of the Court of Preſident of the North. In <hi>Henry</hi> the Vth's Time there were 41 Pariſhes, 17 Chapels, 16 Hoſpitals, and nine Abbeys, beſides the Cathedral, and now there are only 17 Churches in Uſe.</p>
            <p>The preſent Support of the City is chiefly owing to the Gentry, who make it their Winter Reſidence, as there is great Plenty of Proviſions of all kinds to furniſh an elegant Table at a moderate Expence, ſo that the Altar, which was found there, with a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Inſcription, is applicable to the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Place, DIS DEABUSQUE HOSPITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBUS. And as the Inhabitants abound with the Conveniencies of Life, they likewiſe partake of its Diverſions, there being Plays, Aſſemblies, Muſick-Meetings, or ſome Entertainments, every Night in the Week.</p>
            <p>The publick Edifices which moſt deſerve Mention, I ſhall now take Notice of, and firſt of the Bridge over the <hi>Ouſe.</hi> It conſiſts of five Arches: the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the middle Arch, which was the largeſt in the Kingdom, before that at <hi>Blenheim</hi> Houſe was built, is 81 Feet, and its Height 51 Feet. The Reaſon it was built ſo wide, was on occaſion of an Accident which once happen'd to it, when upon a ſudden Thaw, which occaſion'd a great Flood, a prodigious Weight of Ice drove down two Arches of the old Bridge, by which 12 Houſes were demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſeveral Perſons drown'd.</p>
            <p>The great Council-chamber for this City, near which the Records are kept, as alſo the Exchequer and Courts of the Sheriffs, and beneath them the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0141100403:153"/>
two City Priſons for Debtors and Felons, are all upon this Bridge.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle which ſtands at the Confluence of the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and the <hi>Foſs,</hi> was built by <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, <hi>Anno</hi> 1069; and tho' the Face it now wears, and the Uſe made of it, are ſo different from that which was the primitive State of this Fortreſs, yet in its preſent Diſguiſe, it brought to my Memory that Tragical Scene of Bloodſhed perpetrated within its Walls, upon the 11th of <hi>March</hi> 1189; which being to be met with in very few Hiſtorians, I ſhall give a brief Account of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> from their firſt Introduction into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> growing immenſly rich by Traffick, never failed to become the Objects of Envy and Hatred, both to Prince and People, and the ſlighteſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were always eagerly laid hold of, to plunder them; ſo that on every new Acceſſion or Turn of Affairs, they were forced to compound for their Safety, by large Preſents to the Prince.</p>
            <p>At the Acceſſion of <hi>Richard</hi> I. tho' that Prince gave them no Diſturbance, yet he iſſued out an Order, that no <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould be preſent at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Coronation, either at Church or at Dinner.</p>
            <p>However the chief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from all Parts, being ſummoned to <hi>London</hi> by their Brethren there, in order to agree upon a rich Gift to the new King to obtain his Favour and Protection, many of them, notwithſtanding the Injunction, had the Curioſity to ſee the Ceremony; and being diſcovered among the Croud by the Guards, they were beat, abuſed, and ſome of them killed.</p>
            <p>The People hereupon, being poſſeſſed with a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the King had given Orders, that the <hi>Jews</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be deſtroyed, began a Maſſacre of them in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and plundered and burnt their Houſes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them many of their Wives and Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0141100403:154"/>And tho' the King immediately ordered a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to ſtop theſe Proceedings, yet the Example at <hi>London</hi> was followed at <hi>Norwich, Lynn,</hi> and <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and with ſtill greater Fury at <hi>York,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the King, at his Departure to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> left Orders for the Protection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Puniſhment of ſuch as ſhould moleſt them; for, being inflamed by a wicked Prieſt, certain bloody Wretches, who had reſolved upon the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to inrich themſelves with their Pillage, ſet Fire to a Part of the City of <hi>York</hi>; and while the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were buſy in extinguiſhing the Flames, broke into the Houſe of a principal <hi>Jew,</hi> who had been murder'd at <hi>London,</hi> and whoſe Wife had ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it for her Defence; and murdering the whole Family, and all who had taken Refuge there, burnt the Houſe to the Ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> hereupon, in the utmoſt Terror, got Leave to convey all their Wealth into the Caſtle, and obtain'd Shelter there for their own Perſons, and for their Wives and Children, except ſome few, who were ſacrific'd to the Rage of the Populace; who burnt all the Houſes of the <hi>Jews</hi> throughout the City.</p>
            <p>It unluckily happen'd, that the Governor of the Caſtle having Buſineſs in the Town, the poor <hi>Jews,</hi> being afraid he went out to agree upon delivering them up to their Enemies, refuſed him Admittance into it; which incenſing him, he apply'd to the High Sheriff, who raiſing the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> beſieged the Caſtle, and reduced the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that being refuſed Mercy, tho' they offer'd to buy it at the Expence of immenſe Sums, they took the dreadful Advice of one of their Rabbi's, come lately among them from abroad; and firſt having burnt all their rich Goods, and ſo damnify'd even their Plate, that their barbarous Enemies could not be much the better for their Spoils, they ſet Fire to all the Towers of the Caſtle, and fell each Man to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0141100403:155"/>
cutting of the Throats of his own Family, till they had deſtroy'd all who came into this dreadful Scheme of their Rabbi's, who, in the laſt Place, followed the Advice he had given.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Fire of the Caſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, a Number of unhappy <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not come into this bloody Action, (in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to extinguiſh it) from the Walls beſought the Mercy of the Beſiegers, acquainting them with what had happened; and threw over the dead Bodies of their Brethren, in Confirmation of the Truth of what they ſaid; and offering to become Chriſtians, had Hopes given them of their Lives: but no ſooner did their mercileſs Enemies gain Admittance, than they butcher'd every one of the <hi>Jews,</hi> calling aloud for Baptiſm, in hopes of eſcaping their worſe than <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Not ſatisfy'd with this, the barbarous Robbers, as well as Murderers, ran next to the Cathedral, where were depoſited the Bonds and other Securities of the Money owing to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Chriſtians, broke open the Cheſts, and deſtroyed them all.</p>
            <p>There were 500 Men who took Shelter in the Caſtle, beſides Women and Children. So that the whole Number of the <hi>Jews</hi> thus miſerably ſlaughter'd, muſt be between 1000 and 1500, beſides thoſe who were maſſacred in the City.</p>
            <p>We muſt do this Juſtice to the King, who was then in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> that as ſoon as he heard of this unparalleled Proceeding, he was highly incenſed, and ſent Orders to the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and Regent, to go down in Perſon to <hi>York,</hi> and execute ſtrict Juſtice, without Favour or Affection, on all Offenders. The Biſhop came to the City, but the chief Authors of the Riot had fled to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> However, the Citizens were laid under a large Fine, and the Sheriff and Governor of the Caſtle were removed from their Places, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0141100403:156"/>
to Priſon; and the Soldiers concerned in the Fray were puniſhed, and turned out of Service; but not one Man, either then or afterwards, was executed for the unheard-of Villainy.</p>
            <p>The Strength of this Caſtle has been often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in Times of War, and become famous in Hiſtory, upon Account of ſeveral memorable Events. We hope for the future there will never be occaſion to make any other Uſe of it than to the ſame neceſſary Purpoſe, to which it is now converted, namely, a Priſon; but a Priſon the moſt ſtately and complete of any in the whole Kingdom, if not in <hi>Europe.</hi> The preſent Edifice was erected in the Year 1701. In the left Wing of the Building is a handſome Chapel, neatly adorned with ſuitable Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and an Allowance of 40<hi>l.</hi> a Year is ſettled upon a Miniſter, for performing Divine Service, and Preaching to the Priſoners weekly; and ſuch of the Debtors as attend at Sermons, are allowed each a large Loaf of fine Bread. The Juſtices of the Peace take great Care, that the Gaol ſhall be kept as neat within-ſide, as it is noble without. The Felons are allowed Straw, and their Beds are now raiſed from the Ground: and there is an Infirmary apart from the common Priſon, to which the Sick are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and a Surgeon has an appointed Salary to attend them.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle-yard is larger than the Areas of the <hi>Fleet</hi> or <hi>King's-Bench</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and the Situation is ſo high, pleaſant, and airy, that 'tis ſurpriſing any Priſoners ſhould remove themſelves by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to either of thoſe Priſons, unleſs it be with a View of purchaſing the Liberty of the Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here they are never permitted to go without the Walls. Strangers, who viſit the Inſide of it, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom depart without making a trifling Purchace of ſome of the ſmall Manufactures the Priſoners work up for Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0141100403:157"/>The next Building we come to is the Aſſembly-room, for the Entertainment of the Nobility and Gentry, who reſide at <hi>York</hi> during the Races. It was deſigned by the Earl of <hi>Burlington.</hi> That Part which is the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hall, taken from a Draught of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladio,</hi> is in Length 123 Feet, 40 broad, and rather more in Height. This Hall communicates with the common Ball-room, in Length 66 Feet, in Height and Breadth 22 Feet, beſides other Rooms for Cards and Tea: all richly decorated and illuminated with magnificent Luſtres. The Front to the Street is an exceeding fine Piece of Architecture; but the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Hall, if you except the Banqueting-houſe at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> may undoubtedly claim the Preference of any other Room in the Kingdom, if not in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> The Expence of this Edifice, amounting to ſeveral thouſand Pounds, was defrayed by Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, chiefly among the Nobility and Gentry of the County, who contributed, ſome 50<hi>l.</hi> and none leſs than 25<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1728, a very handſome Manſion-houſe was erected for the Lord-Mayor; the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Ruſtick Arcade, which ſupports an <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, with a Pediment in it. There is a large Room the Length of the Front, 49 Feet by 29, ſo that this City has had the Honour to begin a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the City of <hi>London</hi> to copy after.</p>
            <p>The Guild-Hall is a Building very well deſerving Notice, as likewiſe are ſeveral other publick Edifices, which are equally uſeful and ornamental to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient City.</p>
            <p>But what exceeds all others in it, is the Cathedral Church, which for Magnificence of Structure chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges the Pre-eminence of all other <hi>Gothick</hi> Churches, not only in this Kingdom, but throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> if I may rely upon the Opinion of a Gentleman, with whom I viewed it, and who had ſeen the Churches at <hi>Straſburgh, Milan,</hi> and <hi>Notre Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0141100403:158"/>The City of <hi>Lincoln</hi> indeed contends with this of <hi>York,</hi> for a Preference to its Cathedral; and as this is a Point in which both Cities are very tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, I will diſtinguiſh the Particulars wherein each of them have the Advantage over the other, as I have promiſed in Page 6.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place then, <hi>Lincoln</hi> Cathedral has greatly the Advantage of <hi>York,</hi> in the Height of its Situation; and by different Accounts given by ſeveral Authors, of the Dimenſions of both Churches, it appears <hi>Lincoln</hi> exceeds <hi>York</hi> in Length, from Eaſt to Weſt, either 14, or 11, or three Feet and a half: in the middle Croſs or Tranſept from North to South, five Feet; in the outward Breadth of the Weſt End, by the Addition of two Chapels, as at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>London,</hi> 53 Feet; in the Height of the Weſt Towers and Spires 72 Feet; and of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Tower, including the Pinacles, 75 Feet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>York</hi> exceeds <hi>Lincoln</hi> in the Breadth of its middle Nef, and Side Ayles, within-ſide, 26 Feet; in the Height of the middle Nef to its Canopy, 17 Feet; and in the inſide Height of the middle Lantern, 64 Feet and a half.</p>
            <p>The Breadth of the Weſt End of <hi>Lincoln</hi> will not the leaſt avail in this Diſpute, as it has ſo many egregious Defects, not to ſay Abſurdities. The two Steeples are crouded together, inſtead of being placed at the Extremities of the Front, which by that means would have had an Appearance much more grand. They riſe up above the Body of the Church, as if behind a Screen, without the leaſt Affinity to any Part of the Building below. Their Ornaments are but mean, and the Leaden Spires upon them ſtill meaner. The whole Front, extending in a ſtrait Line, wants Boldneſs when viewed at ſome Diſtance; and there is ſuch an Expanſion of ſolid Wall, without Windows, or any ſort of Aperture, as gives a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs throughout. The cloiſtred Work, or Niches
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0141100403:159"/>
for Images, which is the chief ornamental Part of <hi>Gothick</hi> Structures, is diſpoſed with a ſhameful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard to every thing like Deſign: in one Place, crouded with needleſs Profuſion; in another, wanted to fill up, where now there is nothing but a naked and dead Space; and in the Ornaments the Fancy is ſo irregularly varied, that all kind of Connexion and Harmony is deſtroyed, ſo that the Building to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance has the ſame Effect, as if it were Pieces of different Structures patched up together.</p>
            <p>The Plan of the Church is very irregular, the middle Tranſept from North to South having no Ayles on the Weſt-ſide, to anſwer thoſe on the Eaſt. The upper Tranſept, or double Croſs, can never be conſidered as a beautiful Addition, eſpecially ſince this, and the Eaſtern Parts beyond, are ſurrounded with Chapels and Veſtries erected without Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the Windows of the Church are meanly ſmall, crouded, and out of Proportion.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be obſerved, there is a great Reſemblance between the Ground-plat of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and that of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the one was certainly built after the Model of the other.</p>
            <p>The only Defect objected to <hi>York,</hi> is, that the middle Tower or Lantern wants Height, and that the Croſs or Tranſept, from North to South, is built in a different Style and Manner from the reſt of the Cathedral. Both theſe muſt be admitted to be Faults; but, by the way, the middle Lantern is as lofty as the celebrated Towers of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> excluſive of their Pinacles, tho' not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently high in proportion to its Breadth, being 70 Feet ſquare, or to the Height of the Church. They have a Tradition in this City, that a Wooden Spire was once intended to have been raiſed upon this Tower; which in that Caſe would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Height of <hi>Saliſbury</hi> Steeple, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Battlements are higher by ſix Feet, and of a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0141100403:160"/>
larger Square than the preſent Tower at <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ſorry this Project failed, becauſe 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious all Wooden Spires have a moſt wretched Aſpect.</p>
            <p>The only Amendment that can be made, would be to pull down the Bell-turret at one Corner, and to raiſe the Battlements about 20 Feet, piercing them thro' with proper Ornaments; and carry four Pinacles above them, about 20 Feet more.</p>
            <p>However, this Building has two remarkable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to be found in any other <hi>Gothick</hi> Edifice; which are, that the Height and Breadth of the Nef and Side Ayles of the Church, and of all the Arches and Windows come very near, if not agree with, the Dimenſions laid down by the eſtabliſhed Rules of <hi>Roman</hi> Architecture; that the Span of the Roof; from Eaſt to Weſt, riſes very near equal to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Proportion; the exceſſive Height of the Roofs being the chief Blemiſhes in moſt Cathedrals, as may be ſeen at <hi>Lincoln, Saliſbury, Weſtminſter,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Plan of the whole Church is uniform, as well as the Superſtructure, eſpecially from Eaſt to Weſt: the Windows are of a Size and Diſtance proper to the Magnitude of the Structure, and are admirable for their Workmanſhip; neither is it crouded and encumbered on the Outſide by its Butreſſes, but every Part is inrich'd with Ornaments, which receive an additional Beauty from the Colour of the Stone, as it retains almoſt its original Whiteneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus far what I have ſaid of this Building in general was neceſſary, in comparing it with <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln.</hi> I will now take ſome Notice of its ſeveral Parts diſtinctly both within-ſide and without, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt at the Outſide.</p>
            <p>The Weſt End, which is 124 Feet in Breadth, ſhews a Grandeur inexpreſſible; this Front contains
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0141100403:161"/>
two uniform Towers, diminiſhed by ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, all cloiſtred for Imagery, and inrich'd with other Ornaments. In the South Tower hangs a deep Peal of 12 Bells, the Tenor weighing 59 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Weight.</p>
            <p>Between theſe Towers, over the principal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church, is a large Window, whoſe Tracery in Maſons Work is of a Figure ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, that it cannot be equalled any-where. The ſeveral Windows in the Towers are large, and their Tracery and Ornaments well fanſied.</p>
            <p>The South Entrance is aſcended by ſeveral Courſes of Steps, and Tradition aſſures us, there was once as great an Aſcent to the Weſt Door. Here a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Spiral Turret is erected on the middle of the Pediment, and called the <hi>Fiddlers Turret,</hi> from an Image of a Fidler on the Top. Over the Door is a Dial both Horary and Solar, on each Side of which two Images ſtrike the Quarters on two Bells.</p>
            <p>In viewing the Building from this Part Eaſtward, we eaſily diſcerned it to be much newer than that Weſtward, tho' conformable to it.</p>
            <p>The Eaſt Front is exceeding noble, and has the fineſt Window in the World.</p>
            <p>The North Side is the ſame as the South: only a Wall is built to prevent Night-walkers, and other diſorderly Perſons, from neſting and intriguing in the obſcure Corners of the Buttreſſes.</p>
            <p>The Lantern Steeple, of which I have ſpoken already, is ornamented in a fine Taſte, wanting nothing but a better Finiſhing at the Top: it has eight Windows, two on each Side, to give Light within; theſe Windows from Top to Bottom are 45 Feet high.</p>
            <p>We now entered the Inſide, at the Weſt Door, opening into the middle Nef of the Church, under the largeſt <hi>Gothick</hi> Arch in <hi>Europe,</hi> which binds and ſupports the two Towers. The Nef is the moſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0141100403:162"/>
ſpacious of any in <hi>Europe,</hi> except <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome</hi>; it exceeds the Dimenſions of the Nef of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Cathedral four Feet ſix Inches in Width, and 11 Feet in Height; and that of <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey</hi> 16 Feet ſix Inches in Breadth, but its Height is two Feet leſs. This is an Inſtance of what I took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of before, with regard to the Juſtneſs of the Proportion of <hi>York</hi> Cathedral, and at the ſame time ſhews the Extravagance of that of <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi> in this Particular. The Canopy at Top is inriched with curious Knots of Carving.</p>
            <p>From thence we proceeded under the Middle Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, to a Stone Screen, that parts the Choir from the Body of the Church, adorned with curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, among which are placed the Statues of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, from the Conqueſt, to <hi>Henry</hi> VI.</p>
            <p>Over the Entrance into the Choir ſtands the Organ, having a double Front; it had before been removed from thence by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to one Side, oppoſite to the Biſhop's Throne. The Reaſon his Majeſty gave for doing it, was, That it ſpoil'd the Proſpect of the fine Eaſt Windows from the Body of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Choir is adorned with antient Wood-work carved, and ſet up with Cluſters of knotted Pinacles of different Heights. The Aſcent from the Body of the Church, thro' the Choir to the Altar, is by a Gradation of 16 Steps. The Altar has lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a conſiderable Improvement as to its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the whole Church in its Beauty, by taking away a large wooden Screen, which almoſt obſtructed the View of the Eaſt Window. By this means it was carried one Arch farther back, to a Stone Screen of excellent <hi>Gothick</hi> Architecture; which now not only ſhews a Beauty in itſelf, before hid, but opens a View to one of the nobleſt Lights in the World, both for Maſonry and Glazing; which is the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Eaſt Window.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0141100403:163"/>This Window is 30 Feet Nine Inches broad, and 75 Feet high: the Upper-part is a Piece of fine Tracery, but, in my Opinion, not ſo beautiful as that at the Weſt End. Below the Tracery are 117 Partitions, wherein are repreſented, in fine painted Glaſs, moſt of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Bible.</hi> This Window was glazed in 1405, by one <hi>John Thornton,</hi> Glazier of <hi>Coventry</hi>; who received, for his own Work, 4<hi>s.</hi> a Week; and contracted to finiſh the Whole in Three Years.</p>
            <p>In a circular Window, at the South End of the Church, is another fine Piece of Maſonry, in the Form of a Wheel, called <hi>The Marygold Window,</hi> from its painted Glaſs, which reſembles the Colour of that Flower. The North End has Five noble Lights: each conſtitute one large Window, and reach almoſt from Top to Bottom. There is a Tradition, that Five Maiden Siſters were at the Expence of theſe Lights. The Painting of the Glaſs repreſents a kind of Embroidery, or <hi>Moſaick</hi> Needle-work; which might perhaps give Occaſion to the Story.</p>
            <p>I ought not to omit mentioning, that all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Church, except one or two, are adorned with painted Glaſs, repreſenting the Sacred Hiſtory, and the Portraitures of eminent Perſons. This Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was preſerved at the Time of the Civil Wars, by the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> General of the Parliament's Army, who, at the Requeſt of the Gentry and Citizens of <hi>York,</hi> placed a Guard of Soldiers about the Church for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Body of the Church has been lately new paved, the Plan of which was drawn by that ingenious Architect Mr. <hi>Kent,</hi> under the Direction of the Earl of <hi>Burlington:</hi> the Figure is <hi>Moſaick,</hi> and properly adapted to a <hi>Gothick</hi> Building.</p>
            <p>The Monuments in this Church are numerous, many of them very antient, and ſeveral very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0141100403:164"/>
but to enumerate them diſtinctly, would take up more Room than I can ſpare.</p>
            <p>After taking this View of the Cathedral, we were conducted into the Chapter-houſe; a Building which, for a <hi>Gothick</hi> Piece, diſdains to allow an Equal in the Univerſe, and well deſerves the Encomium beſtowed upon it, as is ſaid, by a great Traveller, in an old Monkiſh Verſe inſcribed on the Wall, in Golden Letters, as follows:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ut roſa phlos phlorum, ſic eſt domus iſta domorum.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an Octagon of 63 Feet Diameter. The Height to the Middle Knot of the Roof is 67 Feet ten Inches, unſupported by any Pillars, and intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon one Pin geometrically placed in the Centre. The whole Roof has been richly painted, and the Knots of carved Work, gilt; but is now defaced and ſullied by Time. Over the Roof is a Spire of Timber-work, covered with Lead, admired as a maſterly Piece of Work in the Carpenter's Art. The Eight Squares of the Octagon have each a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow beautifully adorned, and imbelliſhed with painted Glaſs.</p>
            <p>The next Place we ſaw was the Veſtry-room; its Dimenſions 44 Feet by 22: wherein are kept ſeveral Antiquities, particularly the famous Horn ſo called, made of an Elephant's Tooth; which is indeed the greateſt Piece of Antiquity the Church can exhibit, and to which they ought to pay a high Veneration, on Account of the Benefit they reap, from the Act that it witneſſed to. The Account <hi>Camden</hi> gives of it, is;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That <hi>Ulphus</hi> the Son of <hi>Toraldus,</hi> who governed in the Weſt Parts of <hi>Deira,</hi> by reaſon of a Difference likely to happen betwixt his eldeſt Son and his youngeſt, about his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when he was dead, preſently took this Courſe: Without Delay he went to <hi>York,</hi> and taking the Horn, wherein he was wont to drink,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0141100403:165"/>
with him, he filled it with Wine; and kneeling before the Altar, beſtowed upon God, and the bleſſed St. <hi>Peter,</hi> all his Lands."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lands are ſtill called <hi>de Terra Ulphi.</hi> The Horn was imagined to have been quite loſt; but <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> was the Occaſion of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſerved. Where it had lain, or where he got it, is uncertain; but ſtripp'd of its Golden Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it was reſtored by his Succeſſor. The Chapter thought fit to decorate it anew, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the following Inſcription, to the Memory of the Reſtorer, upon it:
<q>CORNU HOC ULPHUS IN OCCIDENTALI PARTE<lb/>DEIRAE PRINCEPS, UNA CUM OMNIBUS TERRIS<lb/>ET REDDITIBUS SUIS, OLIM DONAVIT.<lb/>AMISSVM, VEL ABREPTVM,<lb/>HENRICUS DOM. FAIRFAX DEMVM RESTITVIT.<lb/>DEC. ET CAPIT. DE NOVO ORNAVIT,<lb/>A. D. M.DC.LXXV.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will now conclude my Account of this noble Pile of Building, with the Character given of it (as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> informs us) by <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is, ſays he, famous for its Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and Workmanſhip, all the World over, but eſpecially for a fine lightſome <hi>Chapel,</hi> with ſhining Walls, and ſmall thin waſted Pillars quite round."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The South Side of the Church is inriched by a Library, to which Archbiſhop <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Widow was a great Benefactreſs. A Biſhop was her Father, and an Archbiſhop her Father-in-law; ſhe had Four Biſhops for her Brethren, and an Archbiſhop for her ſecond Huſband.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop had a Palace in the Minſter-yard, where great Hoſpitality was wont to be kept; but it has been long ſince leaſed out. And to ſhew the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0141100403:166"/>
wondrous Change of Times, one End of it is now converted into a Dancing-ſchool, and the other into a Play-houſe.</p>
            <p>In the Archbiſhop's Regiſter and Prerogative Office, is a noble Repoſitory of antient Eccleſiaſtick Records, bearing Date 93 Years earlier than any at <hi>Lambeth</hi> or <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>All-Saints</hi> in the <hi>Pavement</hi> is a beautiful old Church, with a <hi>Gothick</hi> Steeple of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Workmanſhip. Upon the Tower is a fine Lantern (with Pinacles of a conſiderable Height) not much unlike that of <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Margaret</hi>'s Church has one of the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Porches I ever ſaw. It is a moſt ſumptuous and elaborate Piece of <hi>Gothick</hi> Architecture, with our Saviour on the Croſs on the Top of it: but what ſeems ſtill more ſurpriſing is, that they ſay it did not originally belong to the Church, but was brought hither from the diſſolved Hoſpital of <hi>St. Nicolas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Mary's</hi> in <hi>Caſtle-gate</hi> is admired for a pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midical Steeple; as <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church is for a very fine modern one.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1738, a Subſcription was ſet on Foot for an Infirmary in this City, like thoſe begun at <hi>London, Wincheſter,</hi> &amp;c. which we have mentioned. And this excellent Charity has found much Encouragement and Support here.</p>
            <p>A Manufacture of Cotton is lately eſtabliſhed in this City, and is arrived at a very great Perfection; and I could not but be greatly pleaſed, when I was there laſt, to ſee a very handſome Proceſſion made on this Occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>May-day</hi> 1740, at which Time Mr. <hi>Clough,</hi> the Maſter of the Manufactory, together with the ſeveral Artificers concern'd therein, marched thro' the City in the following manner, preceded by the City Muſick; <hi>viz.</hi> There were Three Stages borne, each by Six Porters: On the firſt Stage were the Teazer, Carder, Rover, Spinner,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0141100403:167"/>
and Reeler of the Cotton-wool. On the ſecond, the Bleecher and Winder of the Linen-yarn. On the third, the Quill-winder and Weaver. Each Perſon exerciſing their ſeveral Branches, from the picking of the Wool to the finiſhing the Cloth. The Men, Women and Children, imploy'd in the Manufactory, cloſed the Proceſſion, all of them cloathed with Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, or ſtriped and figured Fuſtians of their own making, provided for them by the generous Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of the Citizens.</p>
            <p>This Manufactory being ſo well fix'd and eſtabliſh'd in ſo ſhort a time, is principally owing to the great Encouragement given by the City, who are determin'd to ſpare no Pains or Expences to ſupport it. The Bells in the Cathedral, and in all the Pariſh Churches, rung the whole Time of the Proceſſion.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>York</hi> ſtands upon more Ground, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than any in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>; but then the Buildings are not ſo cloſe as at <hi>Briſtol</hi> or <hi>Durham,</hi> nor is it ſo populous as either <hi>Briſtol</hi> or <hi>Norwich.</hi> But as <hi>York</hi> is full of Gentry, and Perſons of Diſtinction, ſo they have Houſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to their Quality, which makes the City lie ſo far extended on both Sides of the River.</p>
            <p>While we were here, we took one Day's Time to ſee the fatal Field, called <hi>Marſton Moor,</hi> where Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> a third time, by his Exceſs of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Defect of Conduct, loſt the Royal Army, and had a Victory wrung out of his Hands, after he had all the Advantage he could deſire.</p>
            <p>I made another Excurſion to the Duke of <hi>Leeds</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Kiveton,</hi> then to the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi>'s called <hi>Caſtle Howard,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi>'s at <hi>Laneſborough</hi> in the Eaſt-riding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carliſle-houſe,</hi> or <hi>Caſtle Howard,</hi> is in the Middle of a Wood, which is as great a Wonder in its Kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Mr. <hi>Aiſlabie</hi>'s Park. The Houſe is of a vaſt Extent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tho' it makes a fine Appearance at a Diſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0141100403:168"/>
yet will it not bear a critical Examination of the Architecture, when viewed near. There goes a Story, That the Architect was ſo ſenſible of his Errors in one of the Fronts, that he would fain have perſuaded the late Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> to pull it down again. The Whole is not yet finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi>'s in an old-built Houſe, moſt advantageouſly ſituated on a riſing Ground, with a noble Proſpect as well towards the <hi>Humber,</hi> as towards the <hi>Woulds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I paſſed likewiſe thro' the Foreſt of <hi>Galtres,</hi> a little North of the City. It is in ſome Places very thick of Trees, and in others very mooriſh and boggy: it formerly extended to the very Gates of the City, but now 'tis much leſſen'd; and ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Villages are built in it.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned ſo many Foreſts, you'll un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly conclude, there is no want of Firing in this County. 'Tis very true; for here is not only Wood enough, but Coal too; which is a very great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Poor, againſt the Inclemency of this cold Northern Climate, which indeed has very great need of Firing.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Hambleton-down</hi> are the Races, where the King's Plate of an hundred Guineas is run for once a Year, by Five-Year-Olds; a Gift no-where better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed than on that County, which is ſo famous for breeding of Horſes for the reſt of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>From <hi>York</hi> we enter'd again into the Weſt-riding, and, travelling due Weſt, we came to <hi>Wetherby,</hi> upon the River <hi>Aire,</hi> which we omitted to take in our Courſe as we paſſed by this River in our former Journey, being then more out of our Way than here. It is a good Trading Town, but has nothing remarkable in it.</p>
            <p>Some Miles farther to the South ſtands <hi>Tadcaſter,</hi> upon the South Side of the River <hi>Wherfe,</hi> where the Road from <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and that from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>York,</hi>

But it has nothing that we could ſee to teſtify the Antiquity it boaſts of, but ſome old <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, which our Landlord the Poſt-maſter ſhewed us, among which was one of <hi>Domitian,</hi> of the ſame Kind, I believe, as that which Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> gives an Account of; but ſo very much defaced with Age, that we could read but DO, and AV, at a Diſtance. Here is the Hoſpital and School ſtill remaining, founded by Dr. <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> who, for want of a Proteſtant Archbiſhop, ſet the Crown on the Head of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; but ſhe afterwards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Circumſtance, deprived him.</p>
            <p>Here alſo we ſaw plainly the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſway, which I have before-mentioned at <hi>Aberforth</hi>; and a ſtately Stone Bridge over the <hi>Wherfe.</hi>

            <p>On this Road we paſſed over <hi>Towton,</hi> that famous Field, where a moſt cruel and bloody Battle was fought between the Two Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. I call it moſt cruel and bloody, becauſe the Animoſity of the Par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties was ſo great, that tho' they were Countrymen and Neighbours, nay, as Hiſtory ſays, Relations

(for here Fathers killed their Sons, and Sons their Fathers) for ſome time they fought with ſuch Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Rancour, that they gave no Quarter. 'Tis certain ſuch Numbers were never ſlain in one Battle in <hi>England,</hi> ſince that fought between King <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> at <hi>Battle</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi>; for here fell in the Whole 36000 Men, and the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> proved victorious.</p>
            <p>Tradition guided us to the very Spot; but there remain no viſible Marks of the Action. The Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men indeed ſay, that ſometimes they turn up Arrow-heads, Spear-heads, broken Javelins, Helmets, and the like.</p>
            <p>Farther South ſtill, or rather South-eaſt, on the Road to <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> ſtands <hi>Shirbourn,</hi> a pretty good Town, famous for a well endow'd Hoſpital, erected by one <hi>Hungate</hi> a Proteſtant, for the Maintenance at Bed, Board and Cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Children from Seven till Fifteen Years old; when, according to their Genius and Capacity, ſome are ſent to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or apprenticed out to Trades; for which there is a Proviſion, which, including the Maintenance of the Hoſpital, amounts to 250<hi>l.</hi> a Year. A noble and well choſen Piece of Charity.</p>
            <p>We turned Eaſt to <hi>Selby,</hi> ſituate on the South Side of the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, but very well inhabited, and is famous for giving Birth to our <hi>Henry</hi> I. The <hi>Conqueror</hi> built an Abbey here,</p>
            <p>We then fell down directly South, and came to <hi>Snath</hi> upon the <hi>Aire</hi>; which is but an inconſiderable Town; but, like <hi>Selby,</hi> has a pretty good Trade. I ſhould have mention'd, that there are ſeveral Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that live at <hi>Selby</hi>; and that the <hi>Ouſe</hi> is navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable up to the Town for large Veſſels, and has a good Share of Trade that Way.</p>

            <p>Being now come to the Banks of the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> near the Influx of the <hi>Trent</hi> into the <hi>Humber,</hi> I ſhall, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding you, that I have now accompliſhed another Part of the Propoſition in my laſt Letter, croſs over the <hi>Ouſe</hi> to <hi>Howdon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Howdon</hi> lies on the <hi>Ouſe</hi> North, in the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding of <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> It is a pretty large Town, and is ſubject to great Inundations from the River, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Freſhes which come down from the <hi>Woulds</hi>; and has been ſo, it ſeems, ever ſince 1390; when a Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> built a very tall Steeple to the Church, that in caſe of a ſudden Inundation, the People might ſave themſelves in it. And there have been, within theſe few Years, ſeveral Commiſſions for Repairing the Banks.</p>
            <p>The Fair, or Mart, held here for Eight Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is very conſiderable for Inland Trade, and ſeveral Wholeſale Tradeſmen come to it from <hi>London.</hi> But the Town is more famous for the Birth or Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one of our antient Hiſtorians, <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Hoveden,</hi> or <hi>Howdon,</hi> a Monk of this Abbey. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s Continuator is miſtaken, in ſaying this Town ſtands upon the <hi>Derwent</hi>; for it is above Three Miles South-eaſt of it; tho' the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went</hi> was made navigable, purſuant to Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 1 <hi>Annae,</hi> to the <hi>Ouſe.</hi>

            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> has a Temporal Juriſdiction in this Part of the Country, which is called <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I found nothing in this low Part of the Country but a wonderful Conflux of great Rivers, all pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into the <hi>Humber,</hi> which receiving the <hi>Aire,</hi>

the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> the <hi>Dun,</hi> and the <hi>Trent,</hi> becomes rather a Sea than a River.</p>
            <p>I obſerved, that the Middle of this Diviſion of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> is very thin of Towns and People, being overſpread with <hi>Woulds,</hi> which are Plains and Downs, like thoſe of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> which feed great Numbers of Sheep, Black Cattle, and Horſes, and produce Corn. The Northern Part, eſpecially, is more mountainous, which makes Part of the North-riding. But the Eaſt and Weſt Parts are populous and rich, and full of Towns, the one lying on the Sea Coaſt, and the other upon the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> as above. The Sea Coaſt, or South-eaſt Side, is called <hi>Holderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we travelled North-eaſt up to <hi>Wighton,</hi> being but a very little out of the Way to <hi>Beverley.</hi> It is a ſmall, but antient Market-town, ſeated on the Banks of a little River called <hi>Foulneſs.</hi> Here are ſome <hi>Roman</hi> as well as <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquities. 'Tis ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Delgovitia</hi> Station of the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Ddelw</hi> or <hi>Delgive,</hi> ſignifying <hi>Image.</hi> Some have conjectured, that here has been a Temple of the <hi>Druids,</hi> and that their Groves were in the Wood of <hi>Dierwald,</hi> which they interpret as derived from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Derwen,</hi> an <hi>Oak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the North-weſt of <hi>Wighton</hi> towards the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went,</hi> ſtands the Market-town of <hi>Pocklington,</hi> which we were told was ſo inconſiderable, that it would not be worth our while to go ſo much out of our Way to ſee it. So keeping on Eaſt under the <hi>Woulds,</hi> we arrived at <hi>Beverley,</hi> which is ſituate juſt at the Foot of them, about a Mile from the River <hi>Hull.</hi> It is a large populous corporate Town, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Mayor, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It takes its Name from the great Number of Beavers, with which that River abounded. It had formerly a conſiderable Trade, by means of a Creek, or Cut, commonly called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verley-beck,</hi> of old made from the Town to the River <hi>Hull,</hi> which runs into the <hi>Humber,</hi> for the Paſſage of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0141100403:173"/>
Ships and Boats, Keels, Wherries, Hoys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to and from the ſaid Town; and as it had likewiſe divers Staiths or Landing-places adjoining to the ſaid Beech, for the Lading and Unlading of all ſorts of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, the Town was wont to receive no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from this Cut or River. But there being no ſettled Fund for keeping it open, and cleanſing it, and the Expence of doing it being beyond the Ability of the Corporation, the ſaid Beck was, in time, choaked up, and the Staiths grew out of Repair; whence an Act paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1727, for Cleanſing, Deepening and Widening the Creek, and for Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Staiths, and for Mending the Roads leading from the ſaid Cut to the Town; and at the ſame time providing for the Cleanſing of the Town itſelf: all which has had a very good Effect; for before, the Creek lying in the lower Part of the Town, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

It has all the Advantage, indeed, of a good Situation, to invite Gentlemen to reſide in it; and being the neareſt Town of Note to the Centre of this Riding, the Seſſions are always held here, in a ſpacious and beautiful Hall, which has a publick Garden and Walks, not inferior to any of their kind in <hi>England.</hi> In this <hi>Hall-garth,</hi> as it is called, is a handſome Regiſter-office for Deeds and Wills within this Diviſion; which is the only County in <hi>England,</hi> beſides <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which has ſuch a Regiſtry; to the great Reproach of the Nation be it ſaid, eſpecially when it ſhall be remembered, that no leſs than two Bills (one for a Regiſtry for the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and another, after that, for a General Regiſtry over the whole Kingdom) were reſpectively oppoſed, and miſcarried very lately in Parliament.</p>

At the upper End of the Body of the Church, next the Choir, hangs an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Table with the Picture of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, (from whom the Church is named) and of King <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> the Founder of it, and between them this Diſtich:

                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the Body of the Church ſtands an antient Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they call the <hi>Virgins Tomb</hi>; becauſe Two Virgin Siſters lay buried there, who gave the Town a Piece of Land, into which any Freeman may put Three Milch Kine from <hi>Lady-day</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> At the lower End of the Body of the Church, ſtands a fair large Font of Agat Stone.</p>
            <p>The principal Trade of the Town is making Malt, Oat-meal, and tann'd Leather; but the poor People moſtly ſupport themſelves by working Bone-lace, which of late has met with particular Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Children being maintained at School to learn to read, and to work this Sort of Lace. The Clothing-trade was formerly followed in this Town; but <hi>Leland</hi> tells us, that even in his Time it was very much decayed.</p>
            <p>They have ſeveral Fairs, but one more eſpecially remarkable, called the <hi>Mart,</hi> beginning about Nine Days before <hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> and kept in a Street lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Minſter Garth,</hi> called <hi>Londoners-ſtreet</hi>; for the <hi>Londoners</hi> bring down their Wares, and furniſh the Country Tradeſmen by Wholeſale.</p>
            <p>About a Mile from <hi>Beverly</hi> to the Eaſt, in a Paſture belonging to the Town, is a kind of <hi>Spaw,</hi> tho' they ſay it cannot be judged by the Taſte, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it comes from any Mineral, or not; yet taken inwardly, it is a great Drier, and bathed in, dries ſcorbutick Scurf, and all Sorts of Scabs, and alſo very much helps againſt the King's Evil.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Beverley</hi> I came to <hi>Hull</hi> (properly called <hi>Kingſton upon Hull</hi>) Diſtance Six Miles. If you would have an Idea of <hi>Hamburgh, Dantzick, Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam,</hi> or any of the ſecond Cities abroad, which are famed for their Commerce, you may viſit this Town. It is not indeed ſo large as thoſe; but, in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0141100403:180"/>
proportion to the Dimenſions of it, I believe more Buſineſs is done in <hi>Hull,</hi> than in any Town in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Liverpoole</hi> of late comes very near it; but it has not the Advantage of a <hi>London</hi> Trade, which <hi>Hull</hi> has.</p>
            <p>In the laſt War, the Fleets from <hi>Hull</hi> to <hi>London</hi> were frequently 100 Sail; ſometimes, including the other Creeks in the <hi>Humber,</hi> 160 Sail at a time; and to <hi>Holland</hi> their Trade was ſo conſiderable, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> always imployed Two Men of War to convoy the Merchant-men to and from <hi>Hull,</hi> and thoſe were as many as they ſent to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, all the Trade at <hi>Leeds, Wakefield,</hi> and <hi>Halifax,</hi> of which I have ſpoken ſo particularly, is negotiated here. All the Lead Trade of <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> from <hi>Bautry</hi> Wharf; the Butter of the Eaſt and North-riding brought down the <hi>Ouſe</hi> to <hi>York</hi>; the Cheeſe down the <hi>Trent</hi> from <hi>Stafford, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire</hi>; and the Corn, from all the Counties adjacent, are ſhipped off here.</p>
            <p>So again, they ſupply all theſe Countries with foreign Goods, for which they trade to all Parts of the known World; nor have the Merchants of any Port in <hi>Britain</hi> greater Credit, or a fairer Character, than the Merchants of <hi>Hull,</hi> as well for the Juſtice of their Dealings, as the Greatneſs of their Subſtance. From <hi>Norway,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick, Dantzick, Riga, Narva,</hi> and <hi>Peterſburg,</hi> they make large Returns in Iron, Copper, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Linen and Yarn, and other Things; all which they get Vend for in the Country in prodigious Quantities. They have alſo a great Importation of Wine, Linen, Oil, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> The Trade of Tobacco and Sugars from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they chiefly manage by the Way of <hi>London.</hi> But beſides all this, their Export of Corn, as well to <hi>London</hi> as to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> exceeds all of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0141100403:181"/>
Kind that is or can be at any Port in <hi>England, London</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>Their Shipping is a great Article, in which they exceed all the Towns and Ports on that Coaſt, except <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> ſaving that their Shipping conſiſts chiefly in ſmaller Veſſels than the Coal-trade is ſupplied with, tho' they have a great many large Veſſels too, which are imployed in their foreign Trade.</p>
            <p>The Town is ſituated at the Mouth of the River <hi>Hull,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Humber,</hi> and where the <hi>Humber</hi> opens into the <hi>German</hi> Ocean; ſo that one Side of the Town lies upon the Sea, the other upon the Land. This makes the Situation naturally very ſtrong; and, were there occaſion, it is capable of being made impregnable, by reaſon of the low Grounds round it.</p>
            <p>The Advantages of this Situation ſtruck King <hi>Edward</hi> I. as he was riding a hunting, after his Return from the Defeat of the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Year 1296. Upon which he immediately granted ſeveral Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Immunities to thoſe who would build and ſettle here, erected a Manor-hall himſelf, and fitted up an Harbour, from whence it received the Name of <hi>Kings-town.</hi> It held out againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. who went in Perſon to demand it, when Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> told his Majeſty,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He kept it for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament againſt him."</q>
Yet both the <hi>Hothams. viz.</hi> Father and Son, loſt their Heads by that very Parliament.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> II. on occaſion of the frequent <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars in his Reign, had once reſolved to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Station for a Squadron of Men of War here, with a Yard and Dock for building Ships; and on this Occaſion, reſolved to make the Place ſtrong in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to what thoſe Affairs required: upon which a large Citadel was marked out on the other Side of the River; but it was never finiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0141100403:182"/>The Town is exceeding cloſe built, and populous, even to an Inconvenience, having really no room to extend itſelf by Buildings. There are but Two Churches, <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>St. Mary's</hi>; the former is very large, in which is a fine Altar-piece by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentier</hi>; the latter is thought to have been once larger than it is. King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. uſed it as his Chapel Royal, and with the ſame Freedom; for this Defender of the Faith, and Protector of the Church, pulled down the Steeple, becauſe it ſtood oppoſite to the Place where he reſided. The Inhabitants after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards built it up again at their own Expence.</p>
            <p>They ſhew us ſtill, in their Town-hall, the Figure of a Northern Fiſherman, ſuppoſed to be of <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He was taken up at Sea in a Leathern Boat, which he ſat in, and was covered with Skins, which drew together about his Waiſt, ſo that the Boat could not take in Water, and he could not ſink. The Creature would neither feed, nor ſpeak, and ſo died.</p>
            <p>They have a very handſome Exchange here, where the Merchants from foreign Countries, and others from the different Parts of the Kingdom, meet, as at <hi>London.</hi> The Buſineſs ariſing from the Navigation of all the great Rivers which fall into the <hi>Humber,</hi> is tranſacted here. There is alſo a fine Free-ſchool founded by <hi>John Alcock,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Ely,</hi> who was born at <hi>Beverley,</hi> but choſe to extend his Liberality to this Place. Over the School is the Merchant's Hall.</p>
            <p>But the Trinity Houſe here is the Glory of the Town. It is a Corporation of itſelf, compoſed of a Society of Merchants. It was begun by voluntary Contribution for Relief of diſtreſſed and aged Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their Wives or Widows; but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards improved by the Government, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. They have a very good Revenue, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes every Day by Charities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0141100403:183"/>They maintain 30 Siſters now actually in the Houſe, Widows of Seamen. They have a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by 12 Elder Brethern and Six Aſſiſtants. Out of the 12 they chuſe annually Two Wardens, (but the whole 18 vote in electing them) and Two Stewards. Theſe have a Power to decide Diſputes between Maſters of Ships and their Crews, in Matters relating to Sea Affairs; and with this Limitation, that their Judgment be not contrary to the Laws of the Land; but ſo great Deference is paid to it, that in Trials at Law in ſuch Affairs, they are often called to give their Opinions.</p>
            <p>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the River <hi>Hull,</hi> conſiſting of 14 Arches. A <hi>Greenland</hi> Fiſhery, ſet up in this Town, went on with Succeſs for a while, but it decayed in the Time of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars; and the Houſe built by the <hi>Greenland</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants is now turned into Granaries for Corn, and Warehouſes for other Goods.</p>
            <p>The old Hoſpital, call'd GOD'S HOUSE, ſtands near it, with a Chapel; both which were pulled down in the Civil Wars 1643, but were rebuilt in 1673; and the Arms of the <hi>de la Poles,</hi> being found among the Ruins, were placed over the Door of the Hoſpital, with this Inſcription:
<q>DEO ET PAVPERIBVS POSVIT<lb/>MICHAEL DE LA POLE, 1384.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Michael</hi> was the Son of <hi>William de la Pole,</hi> ſometime a Merchant at <hi>Ravenſpurn,</hi> formerly a flouriſhing Town of Trade at the Mouth of the <hi>Humber</hi>; but being removed to this new Town of <hi>Kingſton,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. gave that King a magnificent Entertainment, when, in the Sixth Year of his Reign, he came to take a View of the Place; upon which our Merchant was knighted. The King afterwards, going into <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> met Sir <hi>William</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0141100403:184"/>
him with ſeveral Thouſands of Pounds, and even mortgaged his Eſtate for his Royal Maſter's Uſe. Such Services could not go unrewarded from ſo generous, and ſo ſucceſsful a Prince. He made him Knight Banneret in the Field, ſettled on him and his Heirs Lands at <hi>Kingſton</hi> to the Value of 500 Marks a Year, and upon his Return into <hi>England</hi> increaſed them to 1000, and advanced him in Time to be Chief Baron of the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> died about 1356, after he had begun a Monaſtery here for the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> His Son, Sir <hi>Michael,</hi> who, 6 <hi>Richard</hi> II. was made Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, not only finiſhed it, but founded likewiſe the Hoſpital called GOD'S HOUSE, above-mentioned. He built moreover a ſtately Palace, called the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s, which Honour he obtained in Right of his Wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldeſt Daughter of Sir <hi>John Wingfield,</hi> who married the Heireſs of <hi>Gilbert Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> But the Happineſs of him, and his Family, being now arrived to the Height, ſet in Misfortunes; for in the Year 1388, he was impeached of High Treaſon, and fled for his Life into <hi>France,</hi> where he died. <hi>William de la Pole</hi> was Prime Miniſter to King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and ſuſpected to be too familiar with his heroick Queen. He was impeached by the Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1450, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; but his Head was ſtruck off by the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Enemies, as ſoon as he ſet his Foot on the <hi>French</hi> Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John de la Pole</hi> married the Siſter of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> IV. and ſo became allied to Royal Blood, and, by that means, expoſed to various Misfortunes; and the famous Cardinal <hi>Polé,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> I. deſcended from that Marriage.</p>
            <p>Here are a great many other Hoſpitals beſides, and likewiſe a Work-houſe, and a good Free-ſchool.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0141100403:185"/>Tho' this Town, and a ſmall adjacent Territory, be generally reckoned in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> yet 'tis really a diſtinct Liberty and County of itſelf, governed by a Mayor, a Sheriff, 12 Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration has Two Swords, one a Preſent from King <hi>Richard</hi> II. and the other from King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. one of which is, on publick Occaſions, carried before the Mayor, and a Cap of Maintenance, and Oar of <hi>Lignum-vitae,</hi> as Enſigns of Honour, the laſt being alſo a Badge of his Admiralty within the Limits of the <hi>Humber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther Eaſt from <hi>Hull</hi> is a little pleaſant Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Mayor-town, called <hi>Heydon</hi>; 'tis handſome, well-built, and hath a little Haven from the Sea, which increaſes daily.</p>
            <p>The Sea incroaches much upon the Land on all the Shore about this Town; and 'tis ſaid, that many large Fields, as well as Towns, which have been formerly known to have been there, have been waſh'd away and loſt.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory tells us, that a Town called <hi>Ravenſburgh</hi> ſtood ſomewhere this way; and 'tis memorable for <hi>Baliol</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> having ſet out thence to recover his Kingdom againſt <hi>Bruce</hi>; and alſo for the Landing of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. when Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and the Reception he met with there from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nobility, againſt <hi>Richard</hi> II. and yet there are no Veſtigia or Traces of this Town to be now met with.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spurn Head,</hi> a long Promontory thruſting out into the Sea, and making the North Point of <hi>Humber,</hi> is very remarkable. But I leave that till I come to the Deſcription of the Sea Coaſts. I can only obſerve, that there is nothing worth Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this Side for above 30 Miles together, not a Port, not a Gentleman's Seat, not a Town of any Note, except <hi>Patrington,</hi> which is a very antient corporate Town, and very pleaſantly ſeated within
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0141100403:186"/>
the Promontory, and had likewiſe formerly a good Harbour: on one Side it looks into the <hi>Humber,</hi> and on the other over ſweet delicious green Fields, which renders its Situation very agreeable. It is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Praetorium</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Way from the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall ends here, as indeed it can hardly go further, unleſs it ſhould extend to <hi>Keln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> a little Village ſtanding at the Head of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spurnhead</hi> is likewiſe ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Occellum</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> deriv'd from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hell,</hi> which ſignifies a high Place on the Eaſt-ſide of this Promontory, on the <hi>German</hi> Sea. The Villages lie very thick, but I met with nothing of Note till we came up to <hi>Hornſey,</hi> which is almoſt ſurrounded with a little Arm of the Sea. The Steeple here is a notable Sea-mark, but is much fallen into Ruin. Here was a whole Street waſh'd away by the Sea, as, 'tis ſaid, a Village called <hi>Hide</hi> was, a little to the North, as well as many other Villages on this Coaſt.</p>
            <p>North-weſt of <hi>Hornſey,</hi> ſome Diſtance from the Sea, ſtands <hi>Kilham,</hi> a Market-town in the <hi>Woulds,</hi> but of no Note.</p>
            <p>We next come to <hi>Burlington,</hi> or <hi>Birdlington,</hi> a good large Market-town, ſituate on a Creek of the Sea. It is a Place of good Trade, and has a ſafe Harbour for Ships, and a good Quay to load and unload them. It is much frequented by the Colliers. The Harbour is made ſtill better, and yet improving, by virtue of ſeveral Acts of Parliament paſſed for Repair of its Piers, the laſt of which, inforcing the former, and ſupplying Defects, was in 1723. Here <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newborough,</hi> (a Village juſt by) one of our Hiſtorians, was a Canon Regular, and reſided, when he fell ſo violently upon <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Hiſtory, and treated him very abuſively, which <hi>Leland</hi> blames him very much for, as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and uncharitable to a Biſhop after his Death.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0141100403:187"/>
It ſeems there was a perſonal Enmity between <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and ſome of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Family; tho' the laſt is in no wiſe to be juſtified in ſome of his fictitious Aſſertions, no more than the other is for abſolutely denying there was ſuch a Man as King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and that the Ground at <hi>Battle Abbey,</hi> where <hi>Harold</hi> was ſlain in fighting againſt the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> always ſweats Blood after Rain.</p>
            <p>The Country People told us a Story here of <hi>Gipſies,</hi> which viſit them often in a ſurpriſing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We were ſtrangely amuſed with their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at firſt, forming our Ideas from the Word, which, in ordinary Signification with us, denotes a Sort of ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lling Vagabonds. But we were ſoon made to underſtand, that the People meant by them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Streams of Water, which at different Seaſons (for none knows when they will happen) guſh out of the Earth with great Violence and Noiſe, ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to a great Height, being natural <hi>Jette d' Eaux,</hi> or Fountains, which afterwards joining together, form little Rivers, and ſo haſten to the Sea. I had not time to examine into the Particulars; and as the Irruption was not juſt then to be ſeen, we could ſay little to it. That which was moſt obſervable to us, was, that the Country People have a Notion, that whenever thoſe <hi>Gipſies,</hi> or, as ſome call them, <hi>Vipſies,</hi> break out, there will certainly enſue either Famine or Plague. This puts me in mind, that the very ſame thing is ſaid to happen at <hi>Swintham</hi> Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in <hi>Surrey,</hi> beyond <hi>Croydon,</hi> and that the Water guſhing out of the chalky Hills about eight Miles from <hi>Croydon,</hi> on the Road to <hi>Ryegate,</hi> fills the whole Bottom, and makes a large River, running juſt to the Town's End of <hi>Croydon</hi>; and then turning to the Left, runs into the River, which riſes in the Town, and ſo to <hi>Caſhalton.</hi> I mention it, becauſe the Country People here have exactly the ſame Notion, that this Water never breaks out but againſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0141100403:188"/>
and as I am ſure it has not now broken out for more than 60 Years, it may, for aught I know, be true.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Burlington</hi> ſtands <hi>Flamborough-head,</hi> a little Promontory, which bends a little into the Sea, and forms the Bay of <hi>Burlington.</hi> It takes its Name from <hi>Flam,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word for a Fire-light; and not far from this Promontory is a very large Ditch, which ſome of the antient Earls of <hi>Holderneſs</hi> threw up as a Boundary to their Juriſdiction and Eſtate. It is call'd <hi>Earls Dyke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humanby</hi> ſtands next, but is ſo inconſiderable, that it has loſt the Privilege of its Market, if it ever had any.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Lebberſton,</hi> a little Village, a ſmall Way from the Sea, the famous River <hi>Derwent</hi> takes its Riſe, and makes its Way Weſt, inſtead of running into the Sea here. And here I take Leave of the <hi>Eaſt-riding,</hi> which is in no wiſe ſo fruitful as the other two Ridings, by reaſon that the middle Part of it is over-run with the <hi>Woulds</hi>; which are high Grounds, barren and mooriſh; but are however well-ſtock'd with Sheep: yet the Eaſtern Part upon the Sea is fruitful and pleaſant, which, as well as the Southern Part, produces all Sort of Grain and Graſs. But then, if you take in its Trade and Traffick, it excels both the other Ridings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scarborough</hi> is the firſt Town we come to upon the Coaſt in the <hi>North-riding</hi>: it is a Borough Baili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Town, the Situation of which is perfectly ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick; bending in the Form of a Creſcent to the main Ocean, of which you have almoſt an unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proſpect from all Parts, it being built on a ſteep Rock, and the Declivity of a lofty Hill, on the Top of which ſtood an antient Caſtle, founded by <hi>William le Gros,</hi> in the Time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and repaired and inlarg'd afterwards by King <hi>Henry</hi> II. but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed in the late Civil Wars. The Summit of this
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0141100403:189"/>
Hill contains no leſs than 18 or 20 Acres of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-ground. The Town is populous, almoſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by the Sea, and walled where it joins not to the Caſtle, or is more ſtrongly defended by the Sea. It has one of the beſt Harbours in the Kingdom, eſpecially ſince the paſſing of an Act of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1732, to inlarge its Piers and Harbour, by which they have gained 6 Feet Depth of Water, which enables the Harbour to receive Veſſels of greater Burden than it could do before. And it is the beſt Place, between <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and the <hi>Humber</hi> capable of receiving in Diſtreſs of Weather Ships coming from the Eaſtern Seas along our Northern Coaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters (whoſe admirable Virtues yearly occaſion a great Concourſe of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom) were firſt diſcovered by Mrs. <hi>Ferrow</hi> about 120 Years ago, then an Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of the Place.</p>
            <p>They are reckoned Cathartick and Diuretick, <hi>much in their Nature like thoſe of</hi> Pyrmont <hi>in</hi> Germany, and are apparently tinged with a Collection of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Salts, as of Vitriol, Alum, Iron, and perhaps Sulphur; but being deemed of the ſame Nature as thoſe of <hi>Cheltenham</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> before deſcrib'd, I refer to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scarborough</hi> may be ſaid even to rival the <hi>Bath</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and, on ſeveral Accounts, is more eligible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting to Strangers. It is well for the <hi>Bath,</hi> that its Seaſons interfere not with theirs; for it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented chiefly in the hot Months of the Summer.</p>
            <p>There are many new Buildings in it; and more going forward, ſo that there is now good Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation for great Numbers even of the higheſt Quality; and they have Aſſemblies and Publick Balls, in long Rooms built on purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate Accident that happen'd in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1737, whereby this famous <hi>Spaw</hi> had like to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0141100403:190"/>
have been loſt, deſerves to be mentioned here. Take then the Account as follows:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaw,</hi> as to its Situation, lay South from the Town, on the Sands, and fronting the Sea to the Eaſt, under a high Cliff on the Back of it, Weſt; the Top of the Cliff being above the High-water Level, 54 Yards; and all about a Quarter of a Mile from the Town.</p>
            <p>The Staith or Wharf adjoining to the Spaw-houſe, was a large Body of Stone, bound by Timbers, and was a Fence againſt the Sea, for the Security of the Houſe; it was 76 Feet long, and 14 Feet high, and in Weight by Computation 2463 Tons. The Houſe and Buildings were upon a Level with the Staith; at the North End of which, and near adjoining to it, upon a ſmall Riſe above the level Sands, and at the Foot of the Stairs that lead up to the Top of the ſaid Staith, and to the Houſe, were the <hi>Spaw</hi> Wells.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday, December</hi> 28, in the Morning, a great Crack was heard from the Cellar of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Houſe, and upon Search, the Cellar was found rent; but at the Time, no farther Notice was taken of it.</p>
            <p>The Night following, another Crack was heard; and in the Morning, the Inhabitants were ſurpriſed to ſee the ſtrange Poſture it ſtood in, and got ſeveral Gentlemen to view it, who being of Opinion the Houſe could not ſtand long, adviſed them to get out their Goods; but they ſtill continued in it.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, between Two and Three in the Afternoon, another Crack was heard, and the Top of the Cliff behind it rent 224 Yards in Length, and 36 in Breadth, and was all in Motion, ſlowly deſcending; and ſo continued till dark. The Ground thus rent, contained about an Acre of Paſture-land, and had Cattle then feeding upon it, and was on a Level with the main Land, but ſunk near 17 Yards perpendicular. The Sides of the Cliff neareſt the <hi>Spaw</hi> ſtood as before, but were rent and broken in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0141100403:191"/>
many Places, and forced forwards to the Sea. The Ground, when ſunk, lay upon a Level, and the Cattle next Morning were ſtill feeding on it, the main Land being as a Wall on the Weſt, and ſome Part of the Side of the Cliff as a Wall to the Eaſt; but the Whole, to View, gave ſuch a confuſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as could hardly be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>The Rent of the Top of the Cliff aforeſaid, from the main Land, was 224 Yards. The Rent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from each End, down the Side of the Cliff, to the Sands, was meaſured on the Sands from one End to the other, 168 Yards; <hi>viz.</hi> 143 South of the Staith and <hi>Spaw</hi> Wells, and 100 to the North of the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Ground ſunk, the Earth, or Sand, on which the People uſed to walk under the Cliff, roſe upwards out of its natural Poſition, for above 100 Yards in Length, on each Side of the Staith, North and South; and was in ſome Places ſix, and in others ſeven Yards above its former Level. The <hi>Spaw</hi> Wells roſe with it; but as ſoon as it began to riſe, the Water at the <hi>Spaw</hi> Well ceas'd run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and was gone.</p>
            <p>The Ground thus riſen was 26 Yards broad; the Staith, which was computed at 2463 Tons, roſe intire and whole, 12 Feet higher than its former Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, (but rent a little in the Front) and was forced forwards towards the Sea, 20 Yards.</p>
            <p>The moſt reaſonable Account then given for this Phaenomenon, and the Occaſion of the Deſtruction of the Staith, and <hi>Spaw</hi> Houſe, and the Loſs for ſome time of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Spring, is as follows:</p>
            <p>When this Staith, or Wharf, was lately rebuilt, (it being thrown down by the Violence of the Sea) Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> Engineer for the building of the new Pier at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> was deſir'd to rebuild this Staith at the <hi>Spaw</hi>; and digging a Trench to lay the Foundation thereof, with great Difficulty clear'd it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0141100403:192"/>
of Water; and when he had done it, could, at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts thereof, very eaſily thruſt his Stick or Cane up to the Handle; from whence it is concluded, that all the Earth under the Staith was of a porous, ſpongy, ſwampy Nature, and was much the ſame below the Foundation of the <hi>Spaw</hi> Houſe, and all under the Sides of the Cliff adjoining, as well North as South.</p>
            <p>Allowing this to be Fact, the ſolid Earth ſinking on the Top of the Cliff, as afore-mention'd, (which was of ſo vaſt a Weight, as by Computation to amount to 261, 360 Tons) preſſing gradually upon and into the ſwampy, boggy Earth beneath it, would of courſe, and did, raiſe the Earth and Sands as before noticed, and ſo effected the Miſchief we have particulariz'd.</p>
            <p>But, very luckily for the Town, after a diligent Search, and clearing away the Ruins, as we may ſay, they found again the <hi>Spaw</hi> Spring; and on Trial, had the Pleaſure to find the Water rather better'd than impair'd by the Diſaſter. And now the Whole is in a more flouriſhing Condition than ever.</p>
            <p>Here is ſuch plenty of all Sorts of Fiſh, that I have hardly ſeen the like. To deſcribe the Herring, the Cod, the Whiting, is only to repeat what is ſaid in other Places, and what we ſhall have occaſion to repeat, more than once, now we begin to go far North.</p>
            <p>We travelled a long Way from <hi>Scarborough,</hi> before we came to the next Market-town, which is <hi>Whitby,</hi> ſituate at the Influx of the little River <hi>Eſk,</hi> into the Sea. It has an excellent Harbour, and a good Trade by Sea, and 'tis ſaid to have above 200 Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. Here are built a great Number of good Ships for the Coal Trade. It hath a good Cuſtom-houſe. The Market is well furniſh'd, and ſupply'd with all Sorts of Proviſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0141100403:193"/>The Harbour and Piers being ſomewhat decay'd they were repair'd by virtue of Two Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Firſt and Seventh Years of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>; and in 1733, an Act paſs'd to preſerve, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and keep the ſaid Piers in Repair for ever.</p>
            <p>By means of theſe ſeveral Acts of Parliament, the Piers of <hi>Whitby</hi> have been rebuilt and completed; but yet for ſome Years paſt the Entrance into the Port has been rendered very narrow and difficult, by reaſon of a Bank of Sand, which has been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Head of the Weſt Pier, inſomuch that it bid fair to choak up the Harbour; nor could this Inconvenience be redreſs'd in the Opinion of the beſt Judges, but by lengthening and extending the Weſt Pier, and its Head, about 100 Yards farther into the Sea. For this Reaſon another Act paſſed in the Eighth of King <hi>George</hi> II. for lengthening the Weſt Pier, and for improving the Harbour.</p>
            <p>At the Foot of ſome Rocks, at this Town, have been found Stones naturally as round as a Bullet, which when broken, ſtony Serpents are found in them, for the moſt part headleſs, look'd upon as a <hi>Luſus Naturae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Place was antiently called <hi>Streanſhall,</hi> and <hi>Oſwy</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> held a Council here, in 663, to determine the Controverſy between thoſe who kept <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the <hi>Britiſh</hi> manner, and thoſe who kept it after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, which <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> the Monk had lately introduced. After the Party for the firſt had ſpoken, the other anſwering, inſiſted they kept <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the manner of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> on whom Chriſt promiſed to build his Church, and had the Keys of Heaven. Upon which the King aſk'd, If it was true, that Chriſt had ſpoken ſo to St. <hi>Peter?</hi> Which the adverſe Party allowing, the King ſwore a great Oath, That he would not diſoblige this Porter of Heaven, leſt, when he came to the Gates, he ſhould remember him: and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0141100403:194"/>
ſo eſtabliſh'd the Celebration of <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Manner.</p>
            <p>Near this Place are ſome Alum Mines, belonging to her Grace the Dutcheſs of <hi>Bucks,</hi> in which there is carry'd on a very conſiderable Trade.</p>
            <p>We inquir'd as to that ſtrange and wonderful Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon relating to the Air here, which, as the wild Geeſe fly over a Piece of Ground near this Place, in hard Winters, to the Lakes in the Southern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, makes them drop down all of a ſudden to the Ground; and had it aſſur'd to us for Truth, though none could aſſign any Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters at <hi>Whitby,</hi> which have had great Reputation. Several curious and antique Coins have been dug up in this Neighbourhood; and a Monaſtery was founded here by St. <hi>Hilda,</hi> about the Year 650; and being deſtroyed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> was afterwards rebuilt: the Ruins of which (very conſiderable) are ſtill to be ſeen. In the Month of <hi>November</hi> 1710, ſuch a dreadful Storm happen'd here, that the Damage to the Shipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was computed at 40,000<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Coaſt inclines North-weſt, and we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it till we came to <hi>Giſborough,</hi> a Market-town pretty well built, a little way from the Sea, upon a ſmall nameleſs River. It is a fine and delicious Situation, endued with ſuch a grateful Variety and Advantages of Nature, as renders it moſt delightfully pleaſant: a fine Scene of Verdure overſpreads all the Grounds about it, which are deck'd with Plenty of Field-flowers, almoſt all the Year round. Some compare it to <hi>Puteoli</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> but allow that it exceeds it in Healthineſs. It ſtands high, and would have been incommoded with cold Breezes (as it ſtands ſo Northerly) from the Sea, but that ſome Hills conveniently interfere, ſo as to qualify the Cold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0141100403:195"/>The Behaviour of the Inhabitants too participates of the Pleaſantneſs of the Place; for they are very courteous, well-bred, and obliging, and very neat and cleanly in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>Here are likewiſe ſome Alum Mines, but not ſo conſiderable and eaſy wrought as thoſe of <hi>Whitby,</hi> which has taken off a great Part of that Trade from hence.</p>
            <p>This pleaſant Town is the laſt on the Eaſt-ſide towards the Sea, in this <hi>North-riding,</hi> in our Way to <hi>Durham.</hi> It made ſo delightful an Impreſſion on my Mind, that I left the whole County in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but this Place, and truly pleaſurable Country about it, in particular, with Regret.</p>
            <p>And thus have I accompliſh'd the third and laſt Part of my Propoſition, with reſpect to my Circuit through this large and far extended County: and though I have been not a little circumſtantial in my Accounts of it, yet there are many curious Matters, that ſtill remain untouch'd, and could not be brought within the Compaſs of an Epiſtolary Correſpondence of this kind.</p>
            <p>But as I have given you only a Deſcription of the County above Ground, take the following Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums of the Treaſures which are contained in its Bowels:</p>
            <p>Alum, Jet, or Black Amber, Copperas, Marble, Pit-coal, Lead, Copper, Limeſtone, and Kelp.</p>
            <p>The firſt Market-town we come to in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Durham,</hi> on the Eaſt-ſide, is <hi>Stockton,</hi> which lies on the North-ſide of the <hi>Teis.</hi> It has riſen, at the Expence of <hi>Yarum,</hi> from a poor pitiful Village, with Clay Walls and Straw Covering to the Houſes, to a well-built Corporate Town, of great Reſort and Buſineſs, govern'd by a Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis famous for its Ale, and a good Trade, which it carries on in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0141100403:196"/>
Lead and Butter, by the <hi>Teis,</hi> with <hi>London,</hi> which formerly was altogether at <hi>Yarum.</hi> But this Town lying nearer the Sea, and conſequently more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, has almoſt engroſs'd the whole Trade to itſelf.</p>
            <p>Coaſting along the Sea-ſide, we come next to <hi>Hartlepool,</hi> which is a famous corporate Mayor-town, and ſeated on a little Promontory, which juts out into the Sea, with which it is encompaſs'd on all Sides, except the Weſt. The Market was much more conſiderable formerly than now; and its chief Subſiſtence riſes only from its good Harbour, which frequently receives the Coal-fleet from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in bad Weather.</p>
            <p>We turn'd from hence to the Left North-weſt, and came to <hi>Durham</hi> next, which is a fine City, pretty large, compact, well-contriv'd, and well ſituated, high, pleaſant, and healthy, and ſurrounded almoſt with the River <hi>Were,</hi> over which are two good Stone Bridges. The Caſtle ſtands on an Eminence, with which the River incloſes the City; as the Caſtle does alſo the Cathedral, the Biſhop's Palace, and the fine Houſes of the Clergy, where they live in great Splendor and Magnificence. All Sorts of Proviſions and other Neceſſaries and Conveniencies for Life, are very cheap, as well as very good, here, tho' it has but one weekly Market, which is kept in a large ſpacious Area in the Town. It is govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and Sheriffs, and has ſix Pariſh Churches, beſides the Cathedral, which is very noble and magnificent, adorn'd with a high Tower, which riſes from the Midſt of it, and two Spires at the Weſt End.</p>
            <p>Thus from a poor Oratory of wreathen Wands and Hurdles, with which the indigent Monks of <hi>Landisfarn</hi> had firſt built it, it is become one of the moſt ſumptuous Buildings of the Kind in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0141100403:197"/>
and was erected out of the Offerings which were made by the ſuperſtitious Multitude at the Shrine of St. <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> And yet, notwithſtanding the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſo many dignified Proteſtant Clergy, 'tis ſaid, there are ſtill great Numbers of <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> in this City.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, that the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> is a Temporal Prince, that he keeps a Court of Equity, and alſo Courts of Juſtice in ordinary Cauſes, within himſelf. He is ſtill Earl of <hi>Sadberg,</hi> and takes Place as Biſhop immediately after the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> As the Country about <hi>Rome</hi> is called St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſo that about <hi>Durham</hi> is St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s, to whom the Church is dedicated, as 'tis ſaid it was founded by the Monks of <hi>Landisfarn. David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> laying all Waſte with Fire and Sword, while King <hi>Edward</hi> III. was at <hi>Calais, Zouch,</hi> the valiant Biſhop, fought the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Nevil's Croſs,</hi> where they were cut in Pieces, and their King taken Priſoner. He was the ſixth Biſhop of <hi>Landisfarn,</hi> or <hi>Holy Iſland,</hi> from whence the See was removed hither.</p>
            <p>The Biſhoprick is eſteemed one of the beſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and the Prebends, and other Church Livings, in the Gift of the Biſhop, are the richeſt in the Kingdom. They told me there, that the Biſhop had thirteen Livings in his Gift, from 300<hi>l.</hi> to 800<hi>l.</hi> a Year; and the Living of the little Town of <hi>Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> a few Miles South of the City, is ſaid to be worth 700<hi>l.</hi> a Year, beſides the ſmall Tythes, which maintain a Curate, or might do ſo.</p>
            <p>This Church is very rich: they have excellent Muſick. The old Veſtments, which the Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation wore, are ſtill us'd on <hi>Sundays</hi> and other Holy-days, by the Reſidents. They are ſo rich with Embroidery and emboſs'd Work of Silver, as muſt needs make it uneaſy for the Wearers to ſuſtain. In this Cathedral lies the Body of the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0141100403:198"/>One of the old Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> purchaſed for a round Sum of Money all the Rights of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate, and other Juriſdiction in this County from King <hi>Richard</hi> I. and, by his laſt Will, left them to the ſucceeding Biſhops. But King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. by Act of Parliament, greatly abridged the Temporal Power and Juriſdiction of this Biſhoprick; and King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. (or rather his Uncle <hi>Somerſet)</hi> by Act of Parliament diſſolved the Biſhoprick intirely; but it was reſtored by Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Neither City nor County ever ſent Members to the Houſe of Commons, till the Vacancy of the See, by the Death of Biſhop <hi>Coſins, Anno</hi> 1672; and ſince they return each of them Two, which is all that the County ſend.</p>
            <p>We took a Trip from <hi>Durham,</hi> South, to ſee <hi>Biſhops Auckland,</hi> which is a Market-town, pleaſantly ſeated upon a Hill, in a very good Air, and is noted for a moſt noble Palace, beautified with Turrets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Biſhop, and alſo a fine Chapel, founded and built by Biſhop <hi>Coſins,</hi> who re-edified the Palace, after the Enthuſiaſtick Rage of the late Civil Wars had ruin'd it.</p>
            <p>Here we turn'd Weſt, and following the <hi>Were,</hi> paſs'd thro' <hi>Wolſingham,</hi> a little Town of no Note, to <hi>Stanhop,</hi> a little Town alſo, which had once a Market, but 'tis now diſcontinued. It is only noted for a very good Park, which lies near it, where King <hi>Edward</hi> III. beſieging the <hi>Scots</hi> in their Camp, had like to have been ſurpris'd in his Tent by one <hi>Douglas,</hi> an adventurous <hi>Scot,</hi> had not the King's Chaplain defended him with the Loſs of his own Life.</p>
            <p>Theſe Weſtern Parts of the County, all to the upper Part of it, are very hilly and mountainous, and the Fields near them look naked and barren; but the Iron Mines they produce within their Bowels, make ample Amends for the Barrenneſs of the Surface.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0141100403:199"/>We return'd from theſe inhoſpitable Parts to <hi>Durham</hi>; from whence we kept the common Road to <hi>Cheſter in the Street,</hi> an old, dirty, thoroughfare Town, void of all Remains of the Greatneſs, which Antiquaries ſay were to be ſeen there, when it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony. Here is a Stone Bridge, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of riding over it, we rode under it, thro' one of the Arches, the Stream not being over the Horſes Hoofs in Water; yet, on Inquiry, we found, that ſometimes they have Uſe enough for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lumley-caſtle,</hi> belonging to the Earl of <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> is juſt on the other Side of the Road, as you paſs between <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> pleaſantly ſeated in a fine Park, near the Eaſt Bank of the River <hi>Were.</hi> The Park, beſides the Pleaſantneſs of it, has this much more valuable Circumſtance to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, that it is full of excellent Veins of the beſt Coal in the Country (for the <hi>Lumley</hi> Coals are known for their Goodneſs at <hi>London,</hi> as well as there). This, with a ſometimes navigable River juſt at hand, by which the Coals are carried down to <hi>Sunderland</hi> to the Ships, makes <hi>Lumley</hi> Park an inexhauſtible Treaſure to the Family.</p>
            <p>They tell us, that King <hi>James</hi> I. lodged in this Caſtle, at his Entrance into <hi>England</hi> to take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Throne; and ſeeing a fine Picture of the antient Pedigree of the Family, which carried it very far beyond what his Majeſty thought credible, turned this good Jeſt upon it to the Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who ſhewed it him, <hi>That indeed he did not know, that</hi> Adam<hi>'s Surname was</hi> Lumley, <hi>before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we turned from the Road, and croſſing the <hi>Were,</hi> followed it Eaſt to <hi>Sunderland,</hi> a Corporate Sea-port Town in the County Palatine of <hi>Durham,</hi> populous and well-built, with a very handſome Church in it; and tho' the River be not large, it carries on a great Trade in Coals, at high Water.

It is a Peninſula, almoſt ſurrounded by the Sea. It has a very fine Church; and its Rector, the Rev. and worthy Mr. <hi>Daniel Newcome,</hi> was the principal Architect in the building of it. This Gentleman ſpent the greateſt Part of his Income in beautifying and adorning it. He began by building a Dome, adjoining to the Eaſt-end, into which he removed the Altar, placing it under a Canopy of inlaid Work, ſupported in Front by Two fluted Pillars of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order, with proper Capitals. His Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and Charity were equally extenſive to all who were proper Objects of them; and he delighted in doing Good. This worthy Man, however, liv'd not to ſee his new Works to the Church quite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, dying very much lamented, on 5 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1738.</p>
            <p>The Eaſtern Side of the County, along the Sea Coaſt, and indeed the Southern Side, along the Banks of the <hi>Teis,</hi> is very fertile and delightful, thick of little Towns and Villages, which are very populous; and as the Mountains on the Weſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Iron Mines, this Side is full of thoſe of Coals, which lie ſo very near the Surface of the Ground, that the Cart Wheels preſs into them.</p>
            <p>And indeed from <hi>Durham,</hi> the Road to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> gives a View of the inexhauſted Store of Coals and Coal Pits, from whence not <hi>London</hi> only, but all the South Part of <hi>England</hi> is continually ſupplied; and tho' at <hi>London,</hi> when we ſee the prodigious Fleets of Ships which come conſtantly in with Coals, we are apt to wonder how it is poſſible for them to be ſupplied, and that they do not bring the whole Coal Country away; yet, when in this Country we ſee the prodigious Heaps, I might ſay Mountains of Coals, which are dug up at every Pit, and how many of thoſe Pits there are, we are filled with equal Wonder to conſider where the People ſhould live that conſume them.</p>

               <hi>Yarrow,</hi> noted for the Birth-place of the Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> ſtands a little higher upon the ſame River; and upon the other Side of the <hi>Tyne</hi> ſtands <hi>Gates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> the Receptacle of the Coal-pit Men, juſt over-againſt <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>; and is ſuppoſed to have been antiently Part of it, tho' divided by the River, over which there is a ſtately Stone-bridge, with an Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the Middle, which ſerves as a Boundary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Biſhoprick and the County of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Air in this Biſhoprick is pretty cold and piercing; and 'tis well for the Poor, that Nature has ſupplied them ſo abundantly with Fuel for Firing; and indeed all other Proviſions and Neceſſaries are very cheap here. It ſeems as if the whole County had been originally appropriated to Religion and War; for it is full of the Ruins of Religious Houſes and Caſtles.</p>
            <p>We are now entering into the large and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which for many Ages was the Bone of Contention, and Seat of War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> is a large and exceeding populous Town, under the Government of a Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is ſituate between the Wall of <hi>Severus</hi> and the <hi>Tyne,</hi> which becomes here a fine deep and noble River, inſomuch that Ships of a middling Burden may come ſafely up to the very Town, tho' the large Colliery Ships are ſtation'd at <hi>Sheals.</hi> It may be conſider'd as divided into Two Parts, whereof <hi>Gateſhead,</hi> before ſpoken of on <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

Side, is one. They are both joined by the Bridge, which conſiſts of Seven Arches, as large, at leaſt, as thoſe of <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and ſupport a Street of Houſes, as that does.</p>
            <p>The Liberty of the Town, as it is a Corporation, extends no farther than the Gate upon the Bridge; which, ſome Years ſince, was the Preſervation of it, by ſtopping a terrible Fire, that otherwiſe had, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, burnt the whole Street of Houſes on the City Side of the Bridge, as it did thoſe beyond it. On the Eaſt Side of this Gate the Arms of the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> are carved, as thoſe of the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> are on the Weſt Side.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a very noble <hi>Exchange</hi> here; and the Wall of the Town runs parallel from it with the River, leaving a ſpacious Piece of Ground before it between the Water and the Wall; which being well wharfed up, and faced with Free-ſtone, makes the longeſt and largeſt Quay for landing and lading Goods, that is to be ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> except that at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> it being much longer than that at <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a large Hoſpital built by Contribution of the Keel Men, by way of Friendly Society, for the Maintenance of the Poor of their Fraternity, and which, had it not met with Diſcouragements from thoſe who ought rather to have aſſiſted ſo good a Work, might have been a noble Proviſion for that numerous and laborious People. The Keel Men are thoſe who manage the Lighters, which they call <hi>Keels,</hi> by which the Coals are taken from the Staiths, or Wharfs, and carried on board the Ships at <hi>Sheals</hi> to load them for <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral large publick Buildings alſo; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a Houſe of State for the Mayor of the Town (for the Time being) to remove to, and dwell in during his Mayoralty. Here is alſo a Hall
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0141100403:203"/>
for the Surgeons to meet in, where they have Two Skeletons of human Bodies, one a Man, and the other a Woman, and ſome other Rarities.</p>
            <p>And ſince this Work went to the Preſs, I am inform'd, that the Rev. Dr. <hi>Robert Thomlinſon,</hi> Rector of <hi>Whickham</hi> in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and Prebendary of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s, gave to this Corporation a valuable Collection of Books, conſiſting of upwards of 6000 Volumes; and alſo ſettled a Rent-charge of Five Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> for ever, for buying new Books. And <hi>Walter Blackett,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of their Repreſentatives in Parliament, has, at his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, built a handſome Fabrick for the Reception of thoſe Books, and ſettled in Mortmain a Rent-charge of 25<hi>l. per Annum</hi> for ever for a Librarian.</p>
            <p>The Town is defended by an exceeding ſtrong Wall, wherein are Seven Gates, and as many Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, The Caſtle, tho' old and ruinous, overlooks the whole Town. The worſt is, that the Situation of the Town b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing on the Declivity of Two high Hills, and the Buildings being very cloſe and old, render it incommodious, to which the Smoke of the Coals contributes not a little; and conſequently excludes ſuch who ſeek a Reſidence of Pleaſure: but then as the River which runs between the Two Hills, makes it a Place of great Trade and Buſineſs, that Inconvenience is abundantly recompenſed.</p>
            <p>They have Two Articles of Trade here, which are particularly owing to the Coals, <hi>viz.</hi> Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and Salt-pans; the firſt are in the Town, the laſt are at <hi>Sheals,</hi> Seven Miles below it; but their Coals are brought chiefly from the Town. Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious are the Quantities of Coals which thoſe Salt Works conſume; and the Fires make ſuch a Smoke, that we ſaw it aſcend in huge Clouds over the Hills, Four Miles before we came to <hi>Durham,</hi> which is at leaſt 16 Miles from the Place. In ſhort, the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0141100403:204"/>
Town is almoſt ſurrounded with Coal-pits; and <hi>London</hi> is reckoned to take off upwards of 600,000 Chaldrons yearly, at Thirty-ſix Buſhels to the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.</p>
            <p>Here I met with a Remark which was quite new to me, and will be ſo, I ſuppoſe, to many others. You well know, we receive at <hi>London</hi> every Year a great Quantity of Salmon pickled or cured, and ſent up in the Pickle in Kits or Tubs, which we call <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Salmon. In conſequence of this, when I came to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> I expected to ſee great Plenty of Salmon there; but was ſurpriſed to find it, on the contrary, ſo ſcarce, that a good large freſh Salmon was not to be had under Five or Six Shillings. Upon Inquiry I learnt, that really this Salmon, which we call <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Salmon, is taken as far off as the <hi>Tweed,</hi> which is near 50 Miles further, and is brought by Land on Horſes to <hi>Sheals,</hi> where it is cured, pickled, and ſent to <hi>London,</hi> as above; ſo that it is more properly <hi>Berwick</hi> Salmon than <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is but one Parochial Church, called <hi>St. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas,</hi> built by St. <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but ſeveral Chapels as large as Churches. Here are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome Meeting-houſes, and a great many well-endowed Charity-ſchools. It is not only inriched by the Coal Trade, but there are alſo very conſiderable Merchants in it, who carry on Traffick to divers Parts of the World, eſpecially to <hi>Holland, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Norway,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They build Ships here to Perfection as to Strength and Firmneſs, and to bear the Sea, as the Coal Trade requires. This gives an Addition to the Merchants Buſineſs, it requiring a Supply of all Sorts of Naval Stores to fit out thoſe Ships.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a conſiderable Manufacture of Hard Ware, or Wrought Iron, of late Years erected after the manner of <hi>Sheffield,</hi> which is very helpful for
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0141100403:205"/>
imploying the Poor, of which the Town has always a prodigious Number.</p>
            <p>This Town was taken and plundered by the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Beginning of the late Civil Wars; and here it was, (to their eternal Reproach be it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd) that the <hi>Scots</hi> perfidiouſly ſold their King for 2000<hi>l.</hi> in hand, and Security for 2000<hi>l.</hi> more, after he had in Confidence intruſted himſelf in their Hands, and without any Conditions made for him: a Tranſaction equally deteſtable with that of cutting off his Head; or more, if poſſible, as thoſe who did the laſt were his avow'd and implacable Enemies, whereas the others received him as his Friends and Protectors.</p>
            <p>On the 12th of <hi>January,</hi> 1738-9, Part of the antient Gate, leading to the <hi>Caſtle-Garth,</hi> fell down; and tho' ſeveral Shops joined to it, yet nobody receiv'd any Hurt.</p>
            <p>The Town was formerly fortify'd with a great Caſtle, the Walls of which are ſtill ſtanding. Its antient Name was <hi>Monk-Cheſter</hi>; but on the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new Caſtle in the Time of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> it obtain'd its preſent Name. It enjoys great Privileges by the Favour of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and being one of thoſe which are called County-towns, governs itſelf independently of the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>Weſt from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> lies the Bailiwick-Town of <hi>Hexham,</hi> (the <hi>Axelodunum</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi>) a Paſs upon the <hi>Tyne,</hi> famous, or rather infamous, for having the firſt Blood drawn near it in the late Civil War; and where a Detachment of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tho' advantageouſly poſted, were ſcandalouſly defeated by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who gain'd the Paſs, fought thro' the River, and killed about 400 Men, the reſt baſely running away; after which, the Town of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> was as eaſily ſeized upon, without ſtriking a Stroke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0141100403:206"/>The Country round this Town is vulgarly called <hi>Hexhamſhire.</hi> It was formerly the Seat of a Biſhop, till <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. annexed it to that of <hi>Durham.</hi> Its Cathedral was ſtately, before the <hi>Scots</hi> ruin'd the greateſt Part of it in one of their Excurſions. On the other Side of the <hi>Tyne</hi> from <hi>Hexhamſhire,</hi> you ſee a Houſe very beautifully ſituated, belonging to the Family of <hi>Errington,</hi> called <hi>Bifront</hi>; and within Two Miles of <hi>Hexham</hi> is a fine Houſe built by the late unfortunate Earl of <hi>Derwentwater,</hi> called <hi>Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was greatly tempted here to trace the famous Wall built by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or rather rebuilt by them, from hence to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> the Particulats of which, and the Remains of Antiquity ſeen upon it, our Hiſtories are full of. I went to ſeveral Places in the Fields thro' which it paſſed, where I ſaw the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it, ſome almoſt loſt, and ſome very viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But of this more in another Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Northumberland</hi> is a long coaſting County, lying chiefly on the Sea to the Eaſt, and bounded by the Mountains of <hi>Stainmore</hi> on the Weſt, which are in ſome Places inacceſſible, but in many others unpaſſable.</p>
            <p>Here is abundant Buſineſs for an Antiquary; every Place ſhews you ruined Caſtles, <hi>Roman</hi> Altars, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, Monuments of Battles, of Heroes killed, Armies routed, and the like. The Towns of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, Alnwick, Warkworth, Tickill,</hi> and many others, ſhew their old Caſtles, and ſome of them ſtill in tolerable Repair, <hi>Alnwick</hi> in particular, and <hi>Warkworth</hi>; others, as <hi>Bambrough, Norham, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham, Horton, Dunſtar, Wark,</hi> and a great many more, are ſunk in their own Ruins, by mere Length of Time.</p>
            <p>We had <hi>Cheviot</hi> Hills ſo plain in view, that we could not but inquire of the Inhabitants every-where, whether they had heard of the Fight at <hi>Chevy-Chace:</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0141100403:207"/>
they not only told us they had heard of it, but had all the Account of it at their Fingers End; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taking a Guide at <hi>Wooller,</hi> a ſmall Town, lying, as it were, under the Hills, he led us on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Top of the Hill; for, by the way, altho' there are many Hills and Reachings for many Miles, which bear the Name of <hi>Cheviot Hills,</hi> yet there is one of them a great deal higher than the reſt, which, at a Diſtance, looks like the <hi>Pico-Teneriffe</hi> in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> and is ſo high, that it is plainly ſeen from the <hi>Roſemary Top</hi> in the Eaſt-Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> which is near 60 Miles off.</p>
            <p>We were preparing to clamber up this Hill on Foot, when our Guide told us, he would find a Way for us to get up on Horſe-back. He then very artfully led us round to a Part of the Hill, where, in the Winter-ſeaſon, great Streams of Water come pouring down from it in ſeveral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, which were pretty broad, and over-grown on each Side with Alder-trees ſo cloſe and thick, that we rode under them as in an Arbour. In one of theſe Chanels we mounted the Hill, as Beſiegers approach a fortified Town by Trenches, and were got a great way up, before we were well aware of it; for we were already ſo far advanced, that we could ſee ſome of the Hills, which before we thought very high, lying under us, as if they were a Part of the Plain below. As we mounted higher, we found the Hill ſteeper than at firſt; and our Horſes being very much fatigu'd, we alighted, and proceeded on Foot. When we had gain'd the Top, we were agreeably ſurpriſed to ſee a ſmooth and pleaſant Plain half a Mile in Diameter, with a large Pond in the middle of it; for we had a Notion, when at Bottom, that the Hill narrow'd to a Point, and that when we came to the Top, we ſhould be as upon a Pinacle, with a Precipice every Way round us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0141100403:208"/>The Day, to our great Satisfaction, happen'd to be very calm, and ſo clear, that we could plainly ſee the Smoke of the Salt-pans at <hi>Sheals,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Tyne,</hi> which was about 40 Miles South from this. We ſaw likewiſe ſeveral Hills, which our Guide told us were in <hi>England,</hi> and others in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Names of which I have forgot. Eaſtward we ſaw <hi>Berwick,</hi> and to the North the Hills called <hi>Soutra</hi> Hills, which are in Sight of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> In ſhort, we had a ſurprizing View of the united Kingdom; and tho' all the Country round us looked very well, yet, it muſt be owned, the <hi>Scots</hi> Side ſeemed the pleaſanteſt, and had the beſt Ground.</p>
            <p>Satisfied with this Proſpect, and not thinking our Time or Pains ill beſtowed, we came down the Hill by the ſame Rout we went up. Our Guide after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried us to a ſingle Houſe, called <hi>Wooller Haugh-head,</hi> a much better Inn than we expected to meet with thereabouts.</p>
            <p>At this Inn, we inquired after the Particulars of the famous Story of <hi>Chevy Chaſe,</hi> and found that the People had the following Notion of it; That it was an Inroad of the Earl of <hi>Douglas</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> in order to ravage, burn, and plunder the Country, as was uſual in thoſe Days: That <hi>Piercy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> march'd with his Friends and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to meet the <hi>Scots</hi>; both Parties encounter'd at the Foot of <hi>Cheviot Hills,</hi> and a bloody Battle enſued, wherein both the Earls were ſlain, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately fighting at the Head of their Troops; and ſo many fell on both Sides, that it could not be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd which had the Victory.</p>
            <p>They ſhewed us the Place where this Battle was fought, which, if their Tradition does not miſlead them, is on the Side of the Hill near the Road. It is ſaid, the <hi>Scots</hi> were moſtly Horſe, and therefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archers placed themſelves on the Side of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0141100403:209"/>
a ſteep Aſcent, that they might not be broken in upon by them. The Spots of Ground where the Two Earls are ſaid to have fallen, are diſtinguiſhed by Two Stones to this Day. The Fight the <hi>Scots</hi> call the Battle of <hi>Otterburn,</hi> and make a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Story of it, to the Honour of their Nation.</p>
            <p>About Six or Seven Miles from hence we ſaw the ever memorable <hi>Flodden-field,</hi> where <hi>James</hi> IV. King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> invading <hi>England</hi> with a great Army, when <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was engaged abroad in the Siege of <hi>Tournay,</hi> was met by the gallant Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> in which, after a bloody Battle, the <hi>Scots</hi> were totally defeated, and their King, fighting vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly at the Head of his Nobility, was ſlain.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Till,</hi> which our Hiſtorians call a deep and ſwift River, where many of the <hi>Scots</hi> were drown'd in their Flight, ſeemed to me every-where paſſable with great Eaſe; but perhaps it might at that time be ſwelled with ſome ſudden Rain, which the Hiſtorians ought to have taken notice of.</p>
            <p>I muſt not quit <hi>Northumberland</hi> without taking notice, that the Natives of this Country, of the ancient original Race or Families, are diſtinguiſhed by a <hi>Shibboleth</hi> upon their Tongues in pronouncing the Letter <hi>R,</hi> which they cannot utter without a hollow Jarring in the Throat, by which they are as plainly known, as a Foreigner is in pronouncing the <hi>Th:</hi> this they call the <hi>Northumberland R,</hi> or <hi>Wharle</hi>; and the Natives value themſelves upon that Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, becauſe, forſooth, it ſhews the Antiquity of their Blood.</p>
            <p>From hence lay a Road into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Town of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> which I afterwards paſſed thro'; but at preſent inclining to ſee <hi>Berwick upon Tweed,</hi> we turned to the Weſt, and viſited that old Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, where is a fine Bridge over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> built by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; a noble, ſtately Work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 16 Arches, and joining, as may be ſaid,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0141100403:210"/>
the Two Kingdoms. The chief Trade I found here was in Corn and Salmon.</p>
            <p>I am now on the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and muſt call to mind, that I have not yet gone over the Weſtern Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>Lancaſter, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt needs own, that ſince I entered upon the View of theſe Northern Counties, I have many times regretted, that my Limits forbid me often to decline the delightful View of Antiquity, of which there is ſo great and ſo ſurprizing a Variety every Day diſcovered; for the religious, as well as military Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the <hi>Britons, Romans, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> like Wounds haſtily healed up, appear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently when the <hi>Callus,</hi> which was ſpread over them, is removed; and though the Earth has defaced the Figures and Inſcriptions upon moſt of theſe Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, yet they are beautiful, even in their Decay; and the venerable Face of Antiquity has ſomething ſo pleaſing, ſo ſurpriſing, ſo ſatisfactory in it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who have, with any Attention, read the Hiſtories of paſt Ages, that I know nothing which renders Travelling more pleaſant and more agreeable.</p>

               <hi>Ireland</hi> is alſo ſhared between both; and for the Northern Coaſt of it, if the <hi>Liverpoole</hi> Men have not the whole Fiſhery, or, at leaſt, in Company with the Merchants of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> the Fault is their own. The Situation of <hi>Liverpoole</hi> is very advantageous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards improving its Commerce, and extending it into the Northern Inland Counties of <hi>England,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> by the new Navigation of the Rivers <hi>Merſee,</hi> the <hi>Weaver,</hi> and the <hi>Dane.</hi> By the laſt the Merchants come ſo near
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0141100403:213"/>
the <hi>Trent</hi> with their Goods, that they make no Difficulty to carry them by Land to <hi>Burton,</hi> and from thence correſpond quite thro' the Kingdom, even to <hi>Hull</hi>; and they begin to be very ſenſible of the Profit of ſuch a Commerce.</p>
            <p>It is ſome Advantage to the growing Commerce of this Town, that the Freemen of it are, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that Freedom, free alſo of <hi>Briſtol</hi>; as they are of the Corporations of <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Not that theſe Corporation Privileges are of any great Value to <hi>Liverpoole</hi> in its foreign Trade; but in particular Caſes, it may be ſome Advantage, as in Town Duties, in admitting them to ſet up Trades in thoſe Corporations, and the like.</p>
            <p>The Town has no Fortifications either to the Land or the Sea; tho' when the late Northern Inſurrection reached to <hi>Preſton,</hi> the Inhabitants would have been glad of Walls and Gates; and indeed, had the Rebel Party had time to have advanced to <hi>Warrington,</hi> ſeized the Paſs there, and taken <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> as they would certainly have done in three Days more, it would have fared but very ill with <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> which could have made but little Reſiſtance againſt an armed and deſperate Body of Men: beſides, the Rebels would have not only found the Sweets of Plunder here, but Arms, Ammunition, Powder, and Lead, all which they extremely wanted. They would have had Ships alſo to have facilitated a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence Numbers would have landed, if it had been only in hopes of Plunder. But, happy for <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> as well as the whole Kingdom! the Rebels were defeated, before they proceeded ſo far.</p>
            <p>The Situation of <hi>Liverpoole</hi> being on the North Bank of the River, with the Diſadvantage of a flat Shore, the Merchants were laid under great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in their Buſineſs; for tho' the Harbour was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0141100403:214"/>
good, and the Ships rode well in the <hi>Offing,</hi> yet they were obliged to ride there as in a Road, rather than a Harbour. Here was no Mole or Haven to bring in their Ships, and lay them up (as the Seamen call it) for the Winter, nor any Quay for the delivering their Goods, as at <hi>Briſtol, Biddiford, Newcaſtle, Hull,</hi> and other Sea Ports. Upon this, the Inhabitants and Merchants, by the Aid of an Act of Parliament paſſed in the Eighth Year of the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> which was prolonged by another, paſſed in the Third Year of his Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. made a large Baſin, or wet Dock, at the Eaſt End of the Town, where, at a very great Charge, the Place conſidered, they have brought the Tide from the <hi>Merſee,</hi> to flow up by an Opening, that looks to the South, and the Ships go in North; ſo that the Town ſhelters it from the Weſterly and Northerly Winds, the Hills from the Eaſterly, and the Ships lie, as in a Mill-pond, with the utmoſt Safety and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. As this is ſo great a Benefit to the Town, the like of which is not to be ſeen in any Place of <hi>England,</hi> for the Merchants Service, <hi>London</hi> excepted, it is well worth the Imitation of many other trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places in <hi>Britain,</hi> who for want of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, loſe their Trade; for indeed the Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>Liverpoole</hi> ſuffered not a little for want of it in the great Storm, <hi>Anno</hi> 1703. This Dock is capable of holding 100 Sail of Ships.</p>
            <p>But tho' theſe new Works have been of ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to this flouriſhing Town, yet ſomething more appeared wanting to crown the Work; for, it ſeems, the Entrance into the Dock or Baſin, from the open Harbour, was ſo ſtreight, that Ships and Veſſels lying in the Dock were often hinder'd from getting out to Sea; and thoſe without the Dock, in the open Harbour, were frequently forced aſhore and loſt. To remedy this Inconvenience, an Act paſſed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1738, for inlarging the ſaid Entrance, and for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0141100403:215"/>
a Pier in the open Harbour, on the North and South Sides of the ſaid Entrance. And as the Lives of divers Perſons were endanger'd and loſt, and Goods often run and ſmuggled, for want of keeping proper and ſufficient Lights in the Night-time, about the ſaid Wet-dock or Baſin, the ſame Act impowers the Corporation to ſet up ſuch a Number of Lamps to enlighten the Dock, as they ſhall think requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: all which muſt be of the higheſt Benefit to this fine Town, and a great Furtherance to its Trade and Navigation.</p>
            <p>The Cuſtom-houſe adjoining to the Dock is alſo but the Work of a few Years paſt, and is not only a commodious, but an elegant Piece of Building.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liverpoole</hi> had formerly but one Church, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to our Lady, and St. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the Pariſh of <hi>Walton</hi>; but upon the Increaſe of Inhabitants, and of new Buildings, in ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a manner, an Act of Parliament paſſed in the Tenth Year of King <hi>William</hi> III. enabling the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to build and endow a new one, and to make <hi>Liverpoole</hi> independent of <hi>Walton. Anno</hi> 1704, the Church of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s on the Eaſt-ſide of the Town, which had been built at the Charge of the Pariſh to which it was appropriated, was conſecrated. But this being ſtill not ſufficient for this flouriſhing Town, her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> in the Third Year of her Reign, granted to the Corporation for 50 Years a Leaſe of the Scite of <hi>Liverpoole</hi> Caſtle, which had long lain in Ruins, whereon to erect a third Church, and other Edifices, under the yearly Rent of 6<hi>l.</hi> 13<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> together with Liberty to uſe the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the old Caſtle for that Purpoſe. And his late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. by Act of Parliament, was pleaſed to make over to the Corporation for ever, on a Reſerve of the ſame annual Rent, the ſaid Scite of the old Caſtle; whereon the Inhabitants erected the ſaid third Church, and in Honour to that Prince,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0141100403:216"/>
dedicated it to St. <hi>George.</hi> It was finiſh'd in the Year 1734, from the Revenues ariſing from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration-Lands, and the Duty on Merchandize, which are eſtimated at 200<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> Theſe Churches are very handſome and capacious Buildings. That on the North of the Town has in it a fine Font of Marble, placed in the Body of the Church, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a beautiful Iron Paliſado; the Gift of the late Mr. <hi>Heyſham,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>London,</hi> but conſiderably concerned in Trade on this Side, and for many Years Member of Parliament for <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> There is a beautiful Tower to this Church, and a new Ring of eight Bells.</p>
            <p>The Town-houſe is a fine modern Building, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all upon Pillars of Freeſtone; the Place under it is their <hi>Tolſey,</hi> or Exchange, for the Meeting of their Merchants; but they begin to want more Room, and talk of inlarging it, or removing the Exchange to the other part of the Town, where the Ships and Merchants Buſineſs is nearer at hand.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a good Free-ſchool, well endow'd, and likewiſe a very noble Charity-ſchool, which was built, and is ſupported, by the generous Contributions of the Inhabitants, for 50 Boys and 12 Girls, who are maintained with Cloaths, Meat, and Lodging, and have proper Education beſtow'd upon them.</p>
            <p>Here are alſo ſeveral Alms-houſes for the Support of Sailors Widows, and other old and indigent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and ſince the Year 1730, a Work-houſe for the Poor has alſo been erected, which, by good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, has reduc'd the Poor's Rate from two Shillings in the Pound to Ten-pence; and they made no Doubt, when I was there laſt, that in a Year or two it would be brought under Six-pence in the Pound.</p>
            <p>It is a Corporate Town, govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen. The Harbour is defended on the South-ſide by a Caſtle, and the Weſt by a Tower on the River <hi>Merſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0141100403:217"/>In a Word, there is no Town in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>London,</hi> that can equal <hi>Liverpoole</hi> for the Fineneſs of the Streets, and Beauty of the Buildings. Many of the Houſes are built of Free-ſtone, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely finiſhed; and all the reſt (of the new Part I mean) of Brick, as handſomely built as <hi>London</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>Formerly <hi>Liverpoole</hi> was but indifferently ſupply'd with freſh Water; but they have been for many Years well accommodated in that reſpect, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an Act of Parliament paſs'd for that Purpoſe, in the Eighth Year of the Reign of her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that ſome of the Streets are named from their Relation to the Family of the <hi>Mores</hi> of <hi>Blank-hall,</hi> formerly chief Lords and Owners of the greateſt Part of <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> and who firſt began to beautify and adorn it with fine Stone Buildings.</p>
            <p>From hence the <hi>Merſee</hi> opening into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, we could ſee the great and famous Road of <hi>Hile Lake,</hi> remarkable for the ſhipping off, or rather Rendezvous of the Army and Fleet under King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> for the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 1689; for here the Men of War rode as our Ships do in the <hi>Downs,</hi> till the Tranſports came to them from <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and this Town.</p>
            <p>Going Eaſt, we paſs'd through <hi>Preſcot,</hi> a large Market-town, but thinly inhabited; and came to <hi>Warrington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a large old-built Market-town upon the River <hi>Merſee,</hi> over which is erected a ſtately Stone Bridge, which is the only Bridge of Communication for the whole County with that of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> It is on the great Road from <hi>London</hi> leading to <hi>Carliſle</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and, in caſe of War, has always been eſteemed a Paſs of the utmoſt Importance. It was found to be ſo upon ſeveral Occaſions in the Time of the late Civil War; and had the Rebel <hi>Scots</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced thus far in the late <hi>Preſton</hi> Affair, ſo as to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0141100403:218"/>
have made themſelves Maſters of it, it would have been ſo again; and, on that Account, the King's Forces took ſpecial Care, by a ſpeedy Advance, to ſecure it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Warrington</hi> is populous and rich, and full of good Country Tradeſmen. Here is particularly a weekly Market for Linen, as I ſaw at <hi>Wrexham</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> a Market for Flanel. The Linen ſold at this Market, is, generally ſpeaking, a Sort of Table Linen, called <hi>Huk-a-buk.</hi> It is likewiſe noted for excellent Malt. I was told there are generally as many Pieces of this Linen ſold here every Market-day, as amount to 500<hi>l.</hi> ſometimes much more, and all made in the Neighbourhood of the Place.</p>
            <p>Not far off is the Village of <hi>Winick,</hi> fam'd for its Rectory, worth about 800<hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>From hence, on the Road to <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> we paſſed the great Bog or Waſte, called <hi>Chat-moſs,</hi> the firſt of that Kind that we ſaw in <hi>England,</hi> from any of the South Parts hither. It extends on the Left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Road for five or ſix Miles Eaſt and Weſt, and they told us it was, in ſome Places, ſeven or eight Miles from North to South. There are many of theſe Moſſes in this County: take this for a Deſcription of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Surface, at a Diſtance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of; for it will bear neither Horſe nor Man, unleſs in an exceeding dry Seaſon, and then ſo as not to be travelled over with Safety.</p>
            <p>The Surface ſeems to be a Collection of the ſmall Roots of innumerable Vegetables matted together, interwoven ſo thick, as well the larger Roots as the ſmaller Fibres, that it makes a Subſtance hard enough to cut out into Turf or Peat, which, in ſome Places, the People pile up in the Sun, and dry for their Fuel. The Roots I ſpeak of are in general ſmall and ſoft, not unlike the Roots of <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> or of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0141100403:219"/>
               <hi>Bearbind,</hi> and have no Earth among them, except what they contract from the Air, and Duſt flying in it; but the Rain keeps them, as it were, always growing, tho' not much increaſing.</p>
            <p>In ſome Places the Surface of this is very thick, in others leſs. We ſaw it ſometimes eight or nine Feet thick, and the Water that drained from it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clear, but of a deep brown, like ſtale Beer. What Nature meant by ſuch an uſeleſs Production, is hard to imagine; but the Land is intirely waſte, except, as above, for the poor Cottagers Fuel, and the Quantity uſed for that is very ſmall.</p>
            <p>Under the Moſs, or rather in the very Body of it, and not here only, but in ſeveral like Places, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in all of them, thoſe antient Fir-trees are found, which are ſo unaccountable, that much Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has been ſhewn to very little Purpoſe on this Subject; for after all, whatever has been ſaid, muſt be mere Conjecture and Uncertainty: but in my weak Judgment, it may be thus accounted for; That Nature, whoſe Works are all directed by a ſuperior Hand, has been guided to produce Trees here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground, as ſhe does in other Places above Ground: that as the Trees above the Surface grow erect and high, theſe lie prone and horizontal: thoſe ſhoot forth Branches and Leaves; theſe ſhoot forth none, yet have a Vegetation by Methods directed by Nature, and particular to that Kind; and 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that if they lie buried, they will grow and increaſe; but if you take them up, and plant them in the Air, they will wither and die.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that theſe Trees are a Kind of Fir, and are very full of Turpentine. Whether there is any Tar in them, I am not poſitive, but I ſuppoſe there is; and yet I do not ſee, that for this Reaſon they ſhould not be a natural ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as other Vegetables are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0141100403:220"/>As to their being brought hither by the general Convulſion of the Globe at the Deluge, the Thought is ſo repugnant to common Senſe, that I think it neither needs nor deſerves any other Notice.</p>
            <p>From hence we came on to <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> one of the greateſt, if not really, <hi>the</hi> greateſt mere Village in <hi>England.</hi> It is neither a Town, City, nor Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, nor ſends Members to Parliament. The higheſt Magiſtrate is a Conſtable, or Headborough; and yet it has a Collegiate Church, takes up a large Space of Ground, and, including the Suburbs, or that Part of the Town on the other Side of the Bridge, it is ſaid to contain above 50,000 People.</p>
            <p>The Increaſe of Buildings at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> within theſe few Years, is a Confirmation of the Increaſe of People; for here, as at <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> and as at <hi>Froom</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> the Town is extended in a ſurpriſing Manner; abundance of new-built Streets are added, as alſo a new Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Anne</hi>; and they talk of founding another, and a fine new Square; by which means the Town is almoſt double to what it was ſome Years ago.</p>
            <p>So that you have here an open Village, which is greater and more populous than many, nay, than moſt Cities in <hi>England.</hi> Neither <hi>York, Lincoln, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Saliſbury, Wincheſter, Worceſter, Glouceſter,</hi> nor <hi>Norwich</hi> itſelf, can come up to it; and for leſſer Cities, two or three put together, would not equal it, ſuch as <hi>Peterborough, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Carliſle,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>Bath, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and ſome others.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> boaſts of Four extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Foundations, a College, an Hoſpital, a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchool, and a Library, all very well ſupported.</p>
            <p>The College was the Charity of <hi>Thomas Weſt,</hi> Lord <hi>Delaware,</hi> who being but the Cadet of the Family, was bred a Scholar, took Orders, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Rector of the Pariſh, which he enjoyed many Years: but, by the Deceaſe of his elder Brother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0141100403:221"/>
Heirs, ſucceeding to his Honour and Eſtate, he founded the College in the Year 1421. The Pope, in Conſideration that the Family was likely to be extinct, is ſaid to have allowed him to marry, on his performing ſo beneficial a Penance. It was dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the two Patron Saints of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> St. <hi>Denys</hi> and St. <hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Foundation eſcaping the general Ruin, under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was diſſolved 1547. in the firſt Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. After this, it was refounded by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; and then anew by Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno</hi> 1578, by the Name of <hi>Chriſt's Church</hi> in <hi>Mancheſter</hi>; and laſt of all it was refounded by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>Anno</hi> 1636, conſiſting then of one Warden, four Fellows, two Chaplains, four Singing Men, and four Choriſters, incorporating them, as they were by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the Name of the Wardens and Fellows of <hi>Chriſt's Church</hi> in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> the Statutes for the ſame being drawn up by Archbiſhop <hi>Laud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Viſitor of this Collegiate Church is the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and his late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Dr. <hi>Peploe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who at the ſame time was Warden of the Church, the Viſitato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Power and the Wardenſhip being incompatible, an Act paſſed <hi>Anno</hi> 1729, impowering his Majeſty to be the Viſitor, whenſoever the Warden of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> happened to be Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hoſpital</hi> was founded by <hi>Humphrey Chetham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and incorporated by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. deſigned by the ſaid bountiful Benefactor for the Maintenance of 40 poor Boys out of the Town and Pariſh of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and ſome other neighbouring Pariſhes; but it is inlarged ſince to the Number of 60, by the Governors of the ſaid Hoſpital, who have improved the Revenues of it.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Founder alſo erected a very fair and ſpacious Library, which is furniſhed with a competent Stock
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0141100403:222"/>
of choice and valuable Books, and daily increaſing, with the Income of 116<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> ſettled to buy Books for ever, and to afford a competent Salary for a Library-keeper. There is alſo a large School for the Hoſpital Boys, where they are daily inſtructed, and taught to read and write.</p>
            <p>The Publick School was founded, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1519, by <hi>Hugh Oldham,</hi> D. D. Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi>; and the Revenues left by him are, of late, very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the School has been ſuitably improved from them.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe publick Benefactions and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there have been ſeveral other conſiderable Sums of Money, and annual Revenues, left and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to the Poor of the ſaid Town, who are thereby, with the Kindneſs and Charity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inhabitants, competently provided for, without ſtarving at Home, or being forced to ſeek Relief Abroad.</p>
            <p>As for the Antiquity of the Place, it is the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunium</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi>; and what is now called <hi>Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> was the Scite of the <hi>Roman Caſtrum</hi>; and many Antiquities have been found here. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Caſtle Wall and Ditch ſtill remain in <hi>Caſtlefield,</hi> as ſome time called.</p>
            <p>The new Church I have mentioned, was finiſhed about the Year 1723, by voluntary Subſcriptions: the Choir is Alcove-faſhion, and the Pilaſters painted of <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> Colour. The old Church is very large, and has Three Rows of neat Pillars. They have Looms that work 24 Laces at a time, an Invention they borrow'd from the <hi>Dutch.</hi> For the Space of Three Miles upwards, they have no leſs than 60 Water-mills. The Town ſtands chiefly on a Rock, and acroſs the River, the large Town, as it may be called, is named <hi>Salthorp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Antiquity of the Manufacture is, indeed, worth taking notice of, which, tho' we cannot trace
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0141100403:223"/>
it by Hiſtory, we have reaſon to believe began ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing earlier than the Woollen Manufactures in other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> of which I have ſpoken ſo often; becauſe the Cotton might itſelf come from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi> and be known by Correſpondents in thoſe Counties, when that of Wool was not puſhed at, becauſe our Neighbours wrought the Goods; and tho' they bought the Wooll from <hi>England,</hi> yet we did not want the Goods: whereas, without making the Cotton Goods at Home, our People could not have them at all; and that Neceſſity, which is the Mother of Invention, might put them upon this; and without ſuch Neceſſity, Ignorance and Neceſſity prevented the other.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Irwell</hi> runs cloſe by <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and receives the little River <hi>Irke</hi> juſt above on the North and North-eaſt Side. There is a very firm, but antient Stone Bridge over the <hi>Irwell,</hi> which is built exceeding high, becauſe this River, tho' not great, yet coming from the mountainous Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſwells ſometimes ſo ſuddenly, that in one Night's time they told me Waters would frequently riſe Four or Five Yards, and the next Day fall as haſtily as they roſe.</p>
            <p>About Eight Miles from <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> North-weſt, lies <hi>Bolton.</hi> We ſaw nothing remarkable in it, but that the Cotton Manufacture reached hither, tho' the Place did not, like <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> ſeem increaſing.</p>
            <p>Here the old Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> was beheaded, <hi>Oct.</hi> 15. 1651, for proclaiming King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>As I have noted above, we turned Eaſt here, and came to <hi>Bury,</hi> a ſmall Market-town on the River <hi>Roch,</hi> which is the utmoſt Bound of the Cotton Manufacture, which flouriſhes ſo well at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> &amp;c. And here the Woollen Manufacture of coarſe Sorts, called <hi>Half-thicks</hi> and <hi>Kerſies,</hi> begins, which imploys this, and all the Villages about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0141100403:224"/>From thence we went to <hi>Rochdale,</hi> a Market-town of good Traffick, a larger, and more populous Town than <hi>Bury</hi>; it lies under the Hills called <hi>Blackſtone Edge</hi>; which having mentioned, at my Entrance this Way into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> I muſt now go back again to the Sea Coaſt; for I took my Courſe that Way up to <hi>Preſton</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, having travelled thus far from <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> in my former Journey to <hi>Halifax,</hi> &amp;c. But muſt firſt obſerve, that there are on this Eaſtern Side of the County, Northward of <hi>Rochdale,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Haſlington, Burnley</hi> and <hi>Coln,</hi> which lie juſt under the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and likewiſe <hi>Blackburn</hi> and <hi>Clithero,</hi> a little Weſt of them: all which being merely Market-towns, and of no other Note, I ſhall ſay no more of them, other than that <hi>Clithero</hi> ſtands upon the <hi>Ribble,</hi> and is the moſt conſiderable; and that at <hi>Coln</hi> and <hi>Burnley</hi> have been diſcovered a great many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins.</p>
            <p>I take <hi>Wigan</hi> firſt, in my Way back to the Sea Coaſt: it lies on the high Poſt-road to <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> This Town has a good Market, and is noted for its Manufacture in Coverlids, Rugs, Blankets, and other Sort of Bedding Furniture; and likewiſe for Pit-coal, and Iron-work.</p>
            <p>Between <hi>Wigan</hi> and <hi>Bolton,</hi> in the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Roger Bradſhaw,</hi> is found great Plenty of what they call <hi>Canel</hi> or <hi>Candle Coal,</hi> the like of which is not to be ſeen in <hi>Britain,</hi> or perhaps in the World. By putting a lighted Candle to them, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in a Flame, and yet hold Fire as long as any Coals whatever, and burn more or leſs as they are placed in the Grate flat or edgewiſe. They are ſmooth and ſleek, when the Pieces part from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and will poliſh like Alabaſter. A Lady may take them up in a Cambrick Hankerchief, and they will not ſoil it, tho' they are as black as the deepeſt Jet. They are the moſt pleaſant and agreeable Fuel
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0141100403:225"/>
that can be found; but are ſo remote from <hi>London,</hi> that the Carriage makes them too dear for common Uſe. We ſaw ſome of them at <hi>Warrington</hi> too; but all from the ſame Pits.</p>
            <p>I muſt not paſs over the <hi>Burning Well,</hi> as it is called, near <hi>Wigan</hi>; the Account of which take in the Words of Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuator: <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <p>"Within a Mile and a half of <hi>Wigan</hi> is a Well, which does not appear to be a Spring, but rather Rain-water, at firſt Sight. There is nothing about it that ſeems extraordinary; but, upon emptying it, there preſently breaks out a ſulphureous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, which makes the Water bubble up as if it boiled: a Candle being put to it, it preſently takes Fire, and burns like Brandy; the Flame in a calm Seaſon will continue a whole Day; by the Heat whereof they can boil Eggs, Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' the Water itſelf be cold. By this Bubbling the Water does not increaſe, but is only kept in Motion by the ſudden <hi>Halitus</hi> of the Vapours breaking out. The ſame Water, taken out of the Well, will not burn; as neither the Mud upon which the <hi>Halitus</hi> has beat."</p>

            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory of</hi> Lancaſhire, not only deſcribes it, but accounts very judiciouſly for the Thing itſelf, and by it for the Warmth of all hot Baths.</p>
            <p>On the ſame Road, a little South, ſtands <hi>Newton,</hi> which had once a Market, but is now difuſed. It is only noted for a very eminent Charity-ſchool, founded in 1707, by one <hi>Hornby,</hi> a Yeoman of the ſame Place. The poorer Sort of Children are taught to read, write, and caſt Accounts, and have Dinners every School-day beſides. There are alſo Ten Boys and Ten Girls, who lodge in an Hoſpital contiguous to the School, where they are provided with all other Neceſſaries till 14 Years old. The Fund for this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0141100403:226"/>
Charity was 2000<hi>l.</hi> A large Sum for a Yeoman to give!</p>
            <p>From hence we paſſed to <hi>Ormſkirk</hi> Weſt, towards the Sea-coaſt. It is a Market-town that has a good Inland-trade; but we ſaw nothing remarkable here, but the Monuments of ſome of the antient Family of the <hi>Stanleys,</hi> before they were ennobled. And here they ſtill continue to bury the Family, whoſe Seat is called <hi>Latham,</hi> not far from this Town; to which belongs a very large Eſtate, and a fine Park. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> Houſe is noted for having been gallantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in the late Civil Wars by a Woman, the Lady <hi>Charlotte,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Derby,</hi> who held it to the laſt Extremity againſt the Parliament Forces, which could never reduce her to capitulate; but kept the Place gloriouſly, till ſhe was relieved by Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert.</hi> It was, however, ruined in a ſecond Siege, and is now ſold out of the Family, and in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Thomas Bootle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who is building a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Houſe there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fernby,</hi> a Village, lies near the Sea-ſide, in the marſhy Grounds, where they dig Turf, that ſerves both for Fire and Candle. Theſe marſhy Grounds extend a great Way North up, beyond <hi>Eccleſton,</hi> and almoſt up to <hi>Preſton.</hi> On the Edge of it Eaſtward is <hi>Marton Mere,</hi> which has been very large; but much of it is now drained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eccleſton</hi> is a Market-town, where nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is to be ſeen: Nor at <hi>Charley,</hi> a Town of the ſame Kind; which lies a little North-eaſt of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſton</hi> ſtands next, a corporate Mayor Town, having Three weekly Markets, well ſupplied and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented. It is a large fine Town, ſituated on the <hi>Ribble:</hi> it is pretty full of People, but not like <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpoole</hi> or <hi>Mancheſter</hi>; for we now come beyond the trading Part of the County. But tho' there is no Manufacture, the Town being honoured with the <hi>Court of Chancery,</hi> and the Officers of Juſtices for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0141100403:227"/>
               <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> is full of Gentlemen, Attorneys, Proctors, and Notaries, the Proceſs of Law being here of a different Nature from that in other Places, by reaſon that it is a Duchy and County Palatine, and has particular Privileges of its own. The People are gay here, tho' not perhaps the richer for that; but it has, on this Account, obtained the Name of <hi>Proud Preſton.</hi> Here is a great deal of good Company, but not ſo much, they ſay, as was before the late bloody Action with the Northern Rebels; not that the Battle hurt many of the immediate Inhabitants, but the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it ſo ſeverely affected many Families there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, that they ſtill retain the Remembrance of it.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Preſton</hi> is <hi>Ribcheſter,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Bretonomacum</hi> of the Antients; a Town which in its flouriſhing State was ſaid to be the richeſt in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> So many Pieces of Antiquity have been dug up in its Neighbourhood, that it was moſt probably a Place of great Importance among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between the <hi>Ribble,</hi> and a little River ſome Miles South of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the Land elbows out, in the Form of a Semi-circle, into the Sea; and this Tract they call the <hi>Field-lands,</hi> in which is a ſmall Market-town, called <hi>Kirkham</hi>; only remarkable for a good Free-ſchool which has Three Maſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poulton</hi> is another Market-town in the ſame Tract, very convenient in its Situation for Trade, being near the Mouth of the River <hi>Wire.</hi> We followed the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, and paſſed through <hi>Garſtang,</hi> which ſtands upon it, about Midway between <hi>Preſton</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and is of no other Note than having a Market; and ſo leaving <hi>Wiredale</hi> Foreſt on our Right, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the County Town, ſituate near the Mouth of the River <hi>Lone,</hi> or <hi>Lune.</hi> The Town is antient, and has little elſe to recommend it than that, and to have given Title to many Branches of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0141100403:228"/>
the Royal Family of <hi>England.</hi> It has a decayed Caſtle, and a more decayed Port, not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Ships of any conſiderable Burden. The Bridge has Five Arches, and is handſome and ſtrong; but here is little or no Trade, and few People. It ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me to hear, that there are not above 60 Pariſhes in all this large County; but many of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently very large, and there are above 120 Chapels of Eaſe, no leſs than 16 of which are in one Pariſh.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> is now the County Gaol, and the Aſſizes are held in it. The Town has only one Pariſh Church, which is fair and ſpacious.</p>
            <p>It is governed by a Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom <hi>Edw.</hi> III. granted the Privilege, That Pleas and Seſſions in the County ſhould be held no-where but at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> It is the <hi>Longovicum</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who have had a Station here. On the ſteepeſt Side of the Hill below the Church hangs a Piece of a <hi>Roman</hi> Wall called <hi>Wery-wall,</hi> derived, as <hi>Camden</hi> thinks, from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Caerwirdd,</hi> a green City, from the Verdure of the Hills.</p>
            <p>As we came along the Sea-ſide, we obſerved a Kind of ſtrange Crows, whoſe Bodies are blue, and Heads and Wings black.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> at the Foot of a high Hill called <hi>Warton Crag,</hi> (on the Top of which is a Beacon) ſtands an agreeable little obſcure Town named <hi>Warton,</hi> upon the Side of a Lake, where is a good Grammar-ſchool, with Accommodations, and a Library for the Benefit of the Maſters; which, together with an Hoſpital for Six poor Men, was founded and endowed by Dr. <hi>Hutton,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> in 1594, who was afterwards tranſlated to <hi>York</hi>; which certainly muſt have been then a Biſhoprick of very great Value, to have induced him to quit <hi>Durham</hi> for it, notwithſtanding its being an Archbiſhoprick, and the Title of <hi>Grace</hi> annexed to its Prelate. Here is alſo a very neat-built Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0141100403:229"/>Higher up North, towards the Extremity of the County, next <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> is <hi>Hornby</hi> Caſtle, upon the River <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Part of the Country ſeemed very ſtrange and diſmal to us, after coming from the South-ſide, which is ſo rich and fertile, that it is noted for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the largeſt Breed of Cows and Oxen in the Kingdom, whoſe Bulk, as well as Horns, are of ſuch a Magnitude as is very aſtoniſhing; beſides their fine ſpotted Deer, which are ſaid to be peculiar to that Part of the County.</p>
            <p>Here, among the Mountains, our Curioſity was frequently moved to inquire what high Hill this was, or that; and we ſoon were ſaluted with that old Verſe in <hi>Camden,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ingleborough, Pendle-hill, <hi>and</hi> Penigent,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Are the higheſt Hills between</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Trent.</l>
               </q>
Indeed they were all, in my Judgment, of a ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Height; but in a Country all mountainous and full of high Hills, it was not eaſy for a Traveller to judge which was higheſt.</p>
            <p>As theſe Hills were lofty, ſo they had an Aſpect of Terror. Here were no rich pleaſant Valleys between them, as among the <hi>Alps</hi>; no Lead Mines and Veins of rich Ore, as in the <hi>Peak</hi>; no Coal-pits, as in the Hills about <hi>Halifax</hi>; but all barren and wild, and of no Uſe either to Man or Beaſt. Indeed here were formerly, as far back as the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſome Copper Mines, and they wrought them to good Advantage; but whether the Vein of Ore failed, or what elſe was the Reaſon,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0141100403:230"/>
we know not, but they are all given over long ſince, and this Part of the Country yields little or nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Weſt of <hi>Hornby</hi> Caſtle is a conſiderable Tract of Ground, which is Part of this County, and runs North, parallel with the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and on the South it runs out in a Promontory into the Sea; it is called <hi>Fourneſs.</hi> We paſſed over the Sands into it, which are very dangerous, and unpaſſable without Guides, who are kept here for that Purpoſe, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Government. It contains, beſides Villages, Four Market-towns, called <hi>Cartmel, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Ulverſton,</hi> and <hi>Howkſhead,</hi> but are of no great Note. It is very mountainous, and full of Lakes or Meres; the largeſt is <hi>Winander Mere,</hi> which makes the utmoſt Northern Bound of this Tract of Ground, as of this Shire. It is famous for producing the Char-fiſh, ſeldom found, unleſs it be at <hi>Ulles-water,</hi> bordering on <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> as I have mention'd before. It is a curious Fiſh, and, as a Dainty, is potted, and ſent far and near by way of Preſent. It muſt needs be a great Rarity, ſince the Quantity they take, even here, is but ſmall. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s Continuator calls it very happily the <hi>Golden Alpine Trout.</hi> This Mere is 18 Miles in Circumference, 10 in Length, and Two in Diameter, and the Bottom is paved, as it were, with one continued Rock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> as has been ſaid, is a County Palatine; and was wont to give Title of Duke to a Branch of the Royal Family; and till the Two Roſes, the White and Red, were united in the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. of the <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Line, with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Heireſs of the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> theſe Two Branches of the Royal Family, by their different Pretenſions to the Crown, gave Occaſion to the Wars and Confuſions, which for many Years made <hi>England</hi> a Scene of

Blood and Deſolation. Three ſucceſſive Princes, <hi>Hen.</hi> IV.

               <hi>Lancaſhire Witches</hi> are ſo much a Phraſe, that I have reſerved to this Place, to mention, that an Act paſſed the 9th of his preſent Majeſty, King <hi>George</hi> II. to reſcue thoſe poor old Creatures, who, by the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Superſtition of the ruſtick Rabble, were ſtyled Witches, from the Terror of the Laws, which tho' in ſome ſort looked upon as obſolete, were nevertheleſs in Force againſt them, and had given too much Occaſion (till within theſe few Years paſt, that the Tryal and Acquittal of <hi>Jane Wenman,</hi> as I have mentioned in <hi>p.</hi> 185. <hi>Vol.</hi> II. diſcouraged the wild Fury and ſuperſtitious Ignorance of the Vulgar) for perſecuting poor Wretches, whoſe Age and Infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, as well as miſerable Poverty, were enough, one would have thought, to intitle them to Pity, rather than to the barbarous Uſage they were wont to meet with.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It muſt be owned, however, that here are ſome very pleaſant manufacturing Towns, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently populous.</p>
            <p>The Manufacture in which the People are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, are chiefly Woollen Cloths, eſpecially at <hi>Kirkby-Lonſdale,</hi> and <hi>Kendal.</hi>

               <hi>Kendal</hi> is a rich and populous Town, has a Free-ſchool well endow'd, and drives a great Trade in Woollen Cloth, Cottons, Druggets, Serges, Hats, and Stockens.</p>
            <p>Over the River <hi>Ken,</hi> whereon <hi>Kendal</hi> ſtands, are Two Bridges of Stone, and another of Wood. At

ſome ſmall Diſtance from the laſt, are to be ſeen the Ruins of a Caſtle; which was the Birth-place of <hi>Catharine Parr,</hi> the Sixth Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. The Church is fair and ſpacious, and there are Two Chapels of Eaſe to it. Near the Church-yard ſtands a fair publick School, whence a certain Number of Scholars are elected to <hi>Queen's-college, Oxon.</hi> It gives Title of Ducheſs to <hi>Erengard Schulemberg,</hi> a Lady of prime Conſequence in the Reign of King <hi>George</hi> I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lonſdale</hi> or <hi>Kirkby-Lonſdale,</hi> is a large Town, has a fair Church, Stone Bridge, and a good Trade for Cloth; and gives Title of Viſcount to the noble Family of <hi>Louther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Upper, or Northern Part of the County, has Two manufacturing Towns, called <hi>Kirkby-Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Appleby</hi>; the laſt is the Capital of the County, has a Free-ſchool and Hoſpital, and is the only Town in the County that ſends Members to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Lonſdale,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Louther,</hi> had a very noble and antient Seat at <hi>Louther,</hi> and upon the River <hi>Louther,</hi> which all together add a Dignity to the Family, and are Teſts of its Antiquity.

Mountains of <hi>Snowden</hi> in <hi>North Wales,</hi> ſeeing nothing round me, in many Places, but unpaſſable Hills, whoſe Tops, covered with Snow, ſeemed to tell us, all the pleaſant Part of <hi>England</hi> was at an End. The great <hi>Winander Mere,</hi> extending itſelf like a Sea, on the Weſt Side, from <hi>North Bridge</hi> on the South, where it contracts itſelf again into a River, up to <hi>Greſemere</hi> North, and is the Boundary of the County, as I have ſaid, on that Side; and the <hi>Engliſh Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls the Mountains of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> North-riding, lie like a Wall of Braſs on the other; and indeed in the moſt literal Senſe they are ſo: for it is the Opinion of the moſt ſkilful and knowing People in the County, that they are full of inexhauſtible Mines of Copper, which is convertible into Braſs, and a Quantity of Gold in them alſo: nay, of late Years, they worked at ſome Copper Mines here; but the Ore lies ſo deep, and is ſo hard to come at, that they did not ſeem to go chearfully on.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the terrible Aſpect of the Hills, when we had paſſed by <hi>Kendal,</hi> and deſcended from the frightful Mountains, the flat Country began to ſhew itſelf; and we ſoon found the North and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt Part of the County to be pleaſant, rich, fruitful, and, if compared to the other Part, may be ſaid to be populous. The River <hi>Eden,</hi> the laſt River of <hi>England</hi> on this Side, as the <hi>Tyne</hi> is on the other, riſes in this Part out of the Side of a prodigious high Mountain, called <hi>Mowill Hill,</hi> or <hi>Wildbore Fell,</hi> which you pleaſe; after which, it runs thro' the Middle of this Vale, which, as I ſaid before, is a very agreeable and pleaſant Country, or, perhaps, ſeems to be ſo the more, in Compariſon with the horrid Height and Narrowneſs of the Eaſtern and Southern Parts. An Act paſſed ſome Years ago to make this River navigable, in which the neighbouring Country find great Advantage.</p>

            <p>There are not many Seats of the Nobility in this Part, tho' ſeveral antient Families receive their Names from hence, as <hi>Strickland</hi> from the Lands of <hi>Strickland, Wharton</hi> (now extinct) from <hi>Wharton-hall, Louther</hi> from the River <hi>Louther, Warcop</hi> of <hi>Warcop, Langdale</hi> of <hi>Langdale, Muſgrave</hi> from <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Perith,</hi> or <hi>Penrith,</hi> called by the <hi>Romans Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terae,</hi> is a handſome Market-town, populous and well-built, and, for an Inland Town, has a very good Share of Trade. It was unhappily poſſeſſed by the late Party of <hi>Scots</hi> Highland Rebels, when they made that deſperate Puſh into <hi>England,</hi> which ended at <hi>Preſton.</hi> In the Moor, or Heath, on the North Part of this Town, the Militia of the County, making a brave Appearance, and infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbering the Highlanders, were drawn up; yet, with their <hi>uſual</hi> Bravery, they ran away as ſoon as the <hi>Scots</hi> began to advance to charge them, and never
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0141100403:240"/>
fired a Gun, leaving the Town at their Mercy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to do Juſtice to the Rebels, they offered no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Town, only quartered in it one Night, took what Arms and Ammunition they could find, and advanced towards <hi>Kendal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> not far from the River <hi>Louther,</hi> is a Row of Pyramidal Stones, Eight or Nine Feet high, pitch'd directly in a Row for a Mile together, and placed at equal Diſtances from each other.</p>
            <p>From hence, in one Stage, thro' a Country full of Caſtles, (for almoſt every Gentleman's Houſe is a Caſtle) we came to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> a ſmall, but well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied City, the Frontier Place and Key of <hi>England</hi> on the Weſt Sea, as <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed</hi> is on the Eaſt; in both which there have been, for many Years, I might ſay Ages, ſtrong Gariſons kept to check the invading <hi>Scots.</hi> From below this Town the famous <hi>Picts</hi> Wall began, which croſſed the whole Iſland to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> which was built upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Occaſion:</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> ſettled here by Force of Arms, they were always haraſs'd by the <hi>Picts,</hi> on the Side of <hi>Scotland.</hi> To ſtop their Inroads, the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> cauſed a Wall of Earth to be built, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from the <hi>German</hi> to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, the Space of 80 Miles, or 27 <hi>French</hi> Leagues, and cauſed it to be paliſado'd, <hi>Anno</hi> 123. <hi>Severus,</hi> the Emperor, built it up of Stone, with Turrets from Mile to Mile, and kept a Gariſon therein. But the <hi>Picts,</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, broke in thro' this Wall more than once. At laſt, <hi>Aetius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> General, rebuilt it of Brick, in 430; but 'twas not long before it was pulled down by the <hi>Picts.</hi> It was Eight Feet thick, and 12 Feet high from the Ground: ſome Part of it is ſtill to be ſeen, both in <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here alſo the great <hi>Roman</hi> Highway, juſt before named, has its End, this being the utmoſt Station of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers on this Side.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0141100403:241"/>But before I go on to ſpeak of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> I muſt return to the Sea Coaſt, which, in this Northern County, is more remarkable than that of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> tho' the other is extended much farther in length; for here are ſome Towns of good Trade: whereas in <hi>Lancaſhire, Liverpoole</hi> excepted, there is nothing of Trade to be ſeen upon the Coaſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt Place I ſhall mention is <hi>Ravenglaſs,</hi> in the South End of the County, which runs between <hi>Fourneſs</hi> and the Sea. 'Tis a well-built Sea Port, and Market-town, upon the River <hi>Eſk,</hi> and on each Side of it run down to the Sea two other ſmall Rivers, which, together with the Sea, make a good Harbour for Ships, and ſurrounds three Parts of the Town, which occaſions a pretty good Trade to it.</p>
            <p>The Cape or Head-land of <hi>St. Bees</hi> (deriv'd from St. <hi>Bega,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Female Saint) ſtill preſerves its Name.</p>
            <p>In the Town is a very good Free-ſchool, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Archbiſhop <hi>Grindal,</hi> who was born here. It was very well endowed by him, and the Charity much increaſed by the late Dr. <hi>Lamplugh,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> Sir <hi>John Louther,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The Library annexed to this Foundation is very valuable, and ſtill increaſing by ſeveral Gifts daily added to it. Tho' the Pariſh is vaſtly large, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage is very poorly endowed.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>St. Bees</hi> ſtands a little Market-town, call'd <hi>Egremont,</hi> noted only for its antient Caſtle and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and for loſing their Privilege of returning Members.</p>
            <p>Under this Shore, higher up North, and near the Cape, is the Town of <hi>Whitehaven,</hi> grown up by the Encouragement of the <hi>Louther</hi> Family, from a ſmall Place, to be very conſiderable by the Coal Trade, which is ſo much increaſed of late, that it is the moſt eminent Port in <hi>England</hi> for it, next <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0141100403:242"/>
for the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and all the Towns of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on that Coaſt, and ſome Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> are wholly ſupply'd from hence. 'Tis frequent in time of War, or upon Occaſion of croſs Winds, to have 200 Sail of Ships at a time go from this Place to <hi>Dublin</hi> loaden with Coals. And Sir <hi>James Louther,</hi> particularly, is ſaid to ſend from hence to <hi>Ireland</hi> annually, as many Coals as bring him in near 20,000<hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>This Increaſe of Shipping has led them on to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing; but the Town is but of few Years ſtanding in Trade: for Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> does not ſo much as name the Place, and his Continuator ſays very little of it.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Town muſt be allow'd to owe principally its flouriſhing Condition to Two Acts of Parliament, one of the 7th, the other of the 11th of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> by virtue of which the Harbour was ſo conſiderably deepened and improved, and ſuch ſtrong and ſubſtantial Moles and Bulwarks erected, that Ships, which before were liable to be driven and caſt away on the Rocks and Shoals on that Coaſt, could lie in Safety, and be ſecure from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Sea. The happy Succeſs of theſe Works encourag'd the Town to apply to Parliament for Powers ſtill farther to improve the good Deſign, that ſo, by inlarging the Moles and Works, and extending them to Low-water Mark, ſuch Depth might be obtained, that the largeſt Ships belonging to the Town might ſail in and out of the Harbour at Neap Tides, and that other Ships frequenting theſe Seas, might ſail in at Half-flood. And accordingly an Act paſſed for this laudable Purpoſe, in the Self. 1739-40, which will prebably effectuate theſe good Ends, and not only preſerve the Lives of many Mariners, but ſtill further improve the Trade and Navigation of this already flouriſhing Town. The ſame Act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides likewiſe for the Repair of the Roads about and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0141100403:243"/>
leading to <hi>Whitehaven,</hi> which were become ruinous and bad, by the great Uſe made of them ſince the Improvements made in the Harbour; for before that they were very narrow, and ſeldom made uſe of by Carts and Wheel-carriages. All theſe Advantages and Increaſe of Trade have occaſion'd a new Church to be lately built at <hi>Whitehaven.</hi> Here is likewiſe a good Trade for Salt.</p>
            <p>Still a little higher to the North is <hi>Moreſby,</hi> where 'tis ſuppoſed has been a <hi>Roman</hi> Fort, there appearing a great many Ruins of Fortifications along the Sea Coaſt, and other Antiquities.</p>
            <p>About ten Miles North-eaſt from <hi>Whitehaven</hi> lies <hi>Cockermouth,</hi> between two Hills, upon the little River <hi>Cocker,</hi> juſt where it falls into the <hi>Derwent</hi>; and is almoſt incompaſſed by the Two Rivers. The former runs thro' it, and is joined again by Two Bridges. It is a Town of good Trade, and well-built. It has a Caſtle on one Hill, and a fair Church on the other. It is about 12 Miles from the Sea, and Veſſels of good Burden may ſecurely come up to it. The <hi>Derwent</hi> is famous for its ſpringing out of thoſe Hills called <hi>Derwent Fells,</hi> where the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Copper Mines were found in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and in which, it was ſaid, there was a large Quantity of Gold. But they are diſcontinued ſince, ſome ſay, becauſe Gold being found among the Ore, the Queen claimed the Royalty, and ſo nobody would work them: but this is rather a Reaſon why they ſhould have applied to the Search with more Vigour; therefore the more probable Cauſe is, that the Charge of working them was too great for the Profits.</p>
            <p>A little Eaſt of <hi>Cockermouth</hi> ſtands <hi>Keſwick,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Market-town, in Decay, inhabited chiefly by Miners, who have their Smelting-houſes here, there being near this Place Mines of Black-lead, which turn to very good Account, and I think are the only Mines of the kind in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0141100403:244"/>Here we ſaw <hi>Skiddaw,</hi> which is there reported to be the higheſt Hill in <hi>England.</hi> It ſeems the higher, becauſe it is not ſurrounded with other Mountains, like moſt of other Counties, as at <hi>Cheviot, Penigent,</hi> and other Places. From the Top of <hi>Skiddaw</hi> one ſees plainly into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and quite into <hi>Dumfries<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and farther.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> is chief Lord of <hi>Cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in Right of his late Ducheſs, the only Heireſs of the antient Family of the <hi>Piercies,</hi> Earls of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſtles and great Houſes of this Eſtate fall to Ruin, as indeed all the Caſtles in this County do; for the two Kingdoms being now united into one, ſtrong Holds are of no more Uſe here, than in any other Part of the Kingdom. I think they told us, the Duke has no leſs than 13 Caſtles in this County, and in <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Derwent</hi> is noted for Trout, and alſo for very good Salmon; which from <hi>Workington,</hi> a Fiſhing-town at the Mouth of this River, they carry, freſh as they take them, up to <hi>London,</hi> upon Horſes, which, changing often, go Night and Day without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and, as they ſay, out-go the Poſt; ſo that the Fiſh come very ſweet and good to <hi>London,</hi> where the extraordinary Price they yield, from two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Sixpence to four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Pound, pays very well for the Carriage. They do the ſame from <hi>Carliſle.</hi>

               <hi>Jerby,</hi> now a conſiderable Market-town, ſtands North-eaſt of <hi>Cockermouth.</hi> It is ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Arbeia</hi> of the Antients.</p>
            <p>From the Mouth of the <hi>Derwent</hi> to that of the <hi>Elen</hi> is ſuppoſed to have been fortified by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> to prevent the Landing of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who infeſted theſe Coaſts; for here have been ſeveral Ruins of Fortifications diſcovered, and ſome of them ſince <hi>Camden</hi>'s Time. At <hi>Elenborough,</hi> 'tis ſaid, the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0141100403:245"/>
firſt Cohort of <hi>Dalmatians</hi> were gariſon'd, where are great Remains of them ſtill to be ſeen, old Vaults open'd, Altars, Stones, and Statues, with Inſcriptions dug up, on them. And at <hi>Wigton,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, further North in the Foreſt of <hi>Allerdale,</hi> are ſeveral Altars pitch'd, which they ſay were brought from <hi>Elenborough,</hi> and old <hi>Carliſle.</hi> But if I was to dwell upon Antiquities, I ſhould find Work enough in this County; and therefore muſt refer you to ſuch Writers as have treated of them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Whitfield</hi> Park, at the Borders of this County, they ſhew you a <hi>Hawthorn</hi> Tree, againſt which the Heads of a Stag and a Dog were formerly nailed up, in Memory of a famous Chace. It ſeems the Dog (not a Greyhound, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor calls it, but a ſtanch Buckhound) ſingly chaſed a Stag from this Park, as far as the <hi>Red Kirk</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which, they ſay, is ſixty Miles at leaſt, and back again to the ſame Place; where, being both ſpent, the Stag, exerting his laſt Force, leap'd the Park Pales, and died on the Inſide; the Hound, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leap after him, had not Strength enough to get over, and fell back, and died on the Outſide juſt oppoſite. The Heads of both were nailed upon the Tree, and underneath this Diſtich on them. The Hound's Name, it ſeems, was <hi>Hercules:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Hercules <hi>kill'd Hart-a-Greeſe,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And Hart-a-Greeſe kill'd</hi> Hercules.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Park were three Oak Trees, which were called <hi>the Three Brether,</hi> the leaſt of which was 13 Yards about; but two of them being quite gone, and only the Stump of the other remaining, I did not think it worth my Time to viſit ſuch a decayed Curioſity.</p>
            <p>Weſt of the <hi>Hawthorn</hi> Tree, and upon the old <hi>Roman</hi> Way, is the famous Column, called the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs Pillar,</hi> the beſt and moſt beautiful Piece of its
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0141100403:246"/>
Kind in <hi>Britain.</hi> It is a fine Column of Free-ſtone, curiouſly wrought and enchas'd, and in ſome Places painted. It has an Obeliſk on the Top, ſeveral Coats of Arms, and other Ornaments in proper Places all over it, with Dials alſo on every Side, and a Braſs Plate with the following Inſcription, in Capital Letters.<q>
                  <hi>This Pillar was erected</hi> Anno 1656, <hi>by the Right Honourable</hi> ANNE <hi>Counteſs Dowager of</hi> Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, <hi>and ſole Heir of the Right Honourable</hi> George <hi>Earl of</hi> Cumberland, &amp;c. <hi>for a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of her laſt parting in this Place with her good and pious Mother, the Right Honourable</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet <hi>Counteſs Dowager of</hi> Cumberland, <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of</hi> April 1616: <hi>in Memory whereof ſhe alſo left an Annuity of Four Pounds, to be diſtributed to the Poor within this Pariſh of</hi> Brougham, <hi>every Second Day of</hi> April <hi>for ever, upon the Stone Table here by.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Counteſs of <hi>Pembroke</hi> had a noble and great Eſtate in this County, and a great many fine old Seats, all which ſhe repaired and beautified, and dwelt ſometimes at one, and ſometimes at another, for the Benefit of her Tenants, and of the Poor, whom ſhe always made deſirous of her Preſence, conſtantly relieving them by her Bounty and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. But thoſe Eſtates are ſince that Time gone into other Families, particularly into that of the Earl of <hi>Thanet,</hi> who has great Eſtates in <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Lady was of the Family of <hi>Clifford</hi>; ſhe had no leſs than Four Caſtles in this County, of which <hi>Pendragon</hi> Caſtle was the chief, which is a fine Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penrith</hi> is accounted the ſecond Town in the County for Wealth and Trade. It is large and well-built, has a very good Market for all Sorts of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0141100403:247"/>
Commodities and Beaſts. The Market-houſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and ſpacious, the Church is large and noble; the Weſt-ſide was defended with a Royal Caſtle, tho' now in Ruins. In the Church-yard we ſaw Two Pillars 14 or 15 Feet aſunder, and the loweſt of them 12 Feet high, tho' they ſeem equal. The People told us, that they were the Monument of Sir <hi>Owen Caeſar</hi>; but there is no Inſcription upon them. This Sir <hi>Owen,</hi> they tell us, was a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of mighty Strength, and of gigantick Stature; and ſo he was, to be ſure, if, as they ſay, he was as tall as one of the Columns, and could touch both Pillars with his Hands at the ſame time. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late no other great Actions of him, but that he killed Robbers, and deſtroyed wild Boars.</p>
            <p>On the North-ſide of the Veſtry of this Church is erected in the Wall an antient ſquare Stone, with a Memorial, intimating, that in the Year 1598, there was a dreadful Plague in thoſe Parts, in which there died in <hi>Kendal</hi> 2500 Perſons; in <hi>Penrith</hi> 2266; in <hi>Richmond</hi> 2200; in <hi>Carliſle</hi> 1196.</p>
            <p>By this Account it ſhould ſeem, that every one of thoſe Towns had ſeparately more People than the City of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> or elſe the Diſtemper was not ſo peſtilential there; and that <hi>Kendal,</hi> which is the only manufacturing Town of them, was the moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>We did not go into the Grotto on the Bank of the River <hi>Eden,</hi> of which mention is made by <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Continuator, the People informing us, that the Paſſage was blocked up with Earth; ſo I muſt be content with telling you, that it ſeems to have been a Lurking-place for Robbers, in old Time. A Place of Strength it could not be; for its Security ſeems to have conſiſted ſolely in its Secrecy. It had certainly been worth ſeeing, had it been paſſable. The Entry is long and dark, but whether ſtrait or crooked, I cannot ſay. The Iron Gates leading to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0141100403:248"/>

            <p>Higher up on the <hi>Eden,</hi> the Eaſt-ſide of the County, is <hi>Kirk-Oſwald,</hi> an indifferent Market-town, that has nothing of Note; and <hi>Brampton</hi> ſtands N.

            <p>At <hi>Burgh upon the Sands,</hi> a little Diſtance from <hi>Carliſle,</hi> is the Monument of our victorious Prince <hi>Edward</hi> I. who having ſo far ſubdued the <hi>Scots,</hi> as to bring away the ſacred Stone at <hi>Scone</hi> Abbey, whereon their Kings uſed to be crowned, died here in his Camp, on his March againſt them, like a true Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, guarding his Frontiers with his lateſt Breath.

               <hi>Caerliſle,</hi> the <hi>Lugo-vallum,</hi> or rather <hi>Brovoniacum</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is ſituated exceedingly pleaſant by the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall, and guarded by Three Rivers; by the <hi>Eden</hi> on the North, by the <hi>Peterel</hi> on the Eaſt, and on the Weſt by the <hi>Caude.</hi> It is a Place of great Antiquity, being firſt builtby an antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince named <hi>Luel,</hi> and from him called <hi>Caer Luel,</hi> i. e. <hi>Luel</hi>'s Town, to which it retains an Affinity of Sound to this Day. It has ſuffer'd the Fate of moſt Frontier Towns; been taken, retaken, burnt, and deſtroyed ſeveral times by the <hi>Scots, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Norwegians</hi>; and lay once in its Ruins for near 200 Years, till <hi>William Rufus</hi> rebuilt it, who ſent a Colony of Southern <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to it, and who is ſaid likewiſe to have built the Caſtle. <hi>Henry</hi> I. dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified it with an Epiſcopal See, and fortified it as a proper Barrier againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>

            <p>The Cathedral Church is a venerable old Pile, but ſeems to have been built at Two different times, or, as it were, rebuilt, the upper Part being much more modern than the lower. A great Part of it was built by St. <hi>David,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who held this County, together with <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> in Vaſſalage from the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He, and many of his Succeſſors, were great Benefactors to it, and nominated ſeveral of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; but almoſt the whole Nave, or Weſt Part of it, was demoliſhed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the Civil Wars. There is another Church called <hi>St. Cuthbert</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. fortified this City againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and built an additional Caſtle to it on the Eaſt Side, which <hi>Camden</hi> calls a Citadel.

               <hi>Carliſle</hi> is a wealthy and populous Place, and the Houſes are well-built, but it is not very large. Here flouriſhes a good Trade in Fuſtians.</p>
            <p>I made a Trip, when I was in theſe Parts, to <hi>Parton,</hi> in this County, which I the rather mention becauſe of the Improvements made in its Harbour of late Years, by virtue of Acts of Parliament made for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For in the fourth and fifth of the late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> an Act had paſſed for inlarging the Piers and Harbour of that Town; but by the Negligence or Death of Truſtees, the Works intended by the Act, were not carried to Effect. This proving a great Diſappointment to the Inhabitants, who had built Houſes on a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a conſiderable Trade in Exportation of Coals, and other Commodities of the County; in the Year 1724, another Act paſſed for Rebuilding the ſaid Piers and Harbour. In Conſequence of this Act, the Pier was rebuilt, and the Harbour made capable of receiving ſeveral ſmall Ships, and a Trade for Coals to <hi>Ireland</hi> and other Parts commenced. This gave Encouragement for another Act, which paſſed <hi>Anno</hi> 1732, to inlarge the Term for 21 Years after the Expiration of the former, in order to make the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſtill more complete, for the Reception of Ships of greater Burden, and to inlarge the River, cleanſe the Harbour, and to bring into it a ſmall Brook, called <hi>Mareſby-beck,</hi> which runs near it. All which will be of great Uſe to the Place, as well as to Trade and Navigation in general.</p>
            <p>In this Northern County are more noted <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities found, than almoſt in any other. It has a Lake called <hi>Ulles-water,</hi> noted for producing the excellent Fiſh called Char, almoſt peculiar to it, and to <hi>Winander-mere. Wry-noſe,</hi> one of its higheſt Hills, is remarkable for its Three Shire Stones, a Foot Diſtance each, one in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> one in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> and the third in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>

               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0141100403:251"/>Near <hi>Salkeld</hi> in this County is a Trophy erected, vulgarly call'd <hi>Long Meg and her Daughters,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 77 Stones; <hi>Long Meg</hi> 15 Feet above Ground, and the reſt but 10.</p>
            <p>This having been a Frontier County, the antient Houſes of the Nobility and Gentry are built for the moſt part Caſtle-wiſe, and are called Caſtles. Thus <hi>Grey-ſtock</hi> Caſtle and <hi>Drumbough</hi> Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; <hi>Cockermouth</hi> Caſtle to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>; <hi>Naworth</hi> Caſtle to the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi>; <hi>Dacre</hi> Caſtle to the late Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi>; <hi>Corby</hi> Caſtle, Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s. And here I muſt be a little more particular on the laſt, which deſerves the Obſervation of the Curious. <hi>Corby</hi> Caſtle is ſituated about Four Miles S. E. of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and is the Seat of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> a Deſcendant from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Family. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of Stone, neat, but plain. The Entrance to this Houſe is by a large ſquare Court-yard. On the Right-hand are the Gardens, and on the Left Offices for the Servants, and Stabling for Horſes. It is plentifully water'd by Springs in ſeveral large Reſervoirs made about the Houſe, which ſtands on the Precipice of a high Rock, which is in the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part about 100 Feet high. In this Rock is cut a regular Pair of Stairs of about Six Feet wide, with all their Ornaments down to the Bottom. As you deſcend theſe Stairs, you paſs by ſeveral Rooms hewn out of the Rock, of about 16 Feet ſquare, which have no other Furniture than Tables, and Seats made out of the Stone. At the Bottom of thoſe Stairs you aſcend another Pair about 10 Feet high, which leads to a Terrace made in Form of a Semicircle, by the Side of which runs the River <hi>Eden,</hi> having a Pair of Stairs to take Water at. The Terrace preſents a fine View of another Part of the Rock, of equal Height with the former; from the Top of which is placed a Caſcade ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0141100403:252"/>
curious, that I know nothing like it. It is at leaſt 100 Feet high, and the Water is broken by the pointed Ridges of the Rock into ſo many various Shapes, and the Springs fly about you in ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rude a manner, as to entertain you with a great Inſtance of the Power of Art in imbelliſhing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is further heighten'd by a natural Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, (effected by this artificial one) of which you have a diſtinct Proſpect, when you arrive at the Landing-ſtairs.</p>
            <p>From hence you have another View, of half a Mile long, of the River on the Right-hand; and a hanging Grove of Trees, juſt as Nature has placed them, on the Left. As you paſs along a Gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk, you ſee ſeveral Figures placed there for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at the End of the Walk is a ſmall Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room, with a Portico in the Front, facing this Walk: it is call'd <hi>Tempe-alter</hi>'. In this River is a Weir, well-ſtock'd with Salmon and other Fiſh. On the other Side of the River, over-againſt the Houſe, are the Remains of an old Caſtle, which is called <hi>Weatheral-Tower,</hi> under which is an Hermit's Cave.</p>
            <p>Weſtward of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi> lies the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi>; of which I ſhall take Notice among the Weſtern Iſles of <hi>Scotland.</hi> [See VOL. IV. p. 253.]</p>

            <p>Being now at the utmoſt Extent of <hi>England</hi> this Way, I ſhall conclude my Letter with a few Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the ROADS of this Part of the United Kingdom in general. And firſt of the natural Soil in many Places, where not mended by Turnpikes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0141100403:253"/>The Soil of all the Midland Part of <hi>England,</hi> even from Sea to Sea, is of a deep ſtiff Clay, or marly Earth; and it carries a Breadth of near 50 Miles at leaſt, in ſome Places much more; nor is it poſſible to go from <hi>London</hi> to any Part of <hi>Britain,</hi> North, without croſſing this clayey dirty Part. For Example:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe we had been to take the great <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Poſt Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Scotland</hi>; you have tolerable good Ways, and hard Ground, till you reach <hi>Royſton,</hi> about 32 Miles, and to <hi>Kneeſworth,</hi> a Mile farther: but from thence you uſed to enter upon the Clays, which beginning at the famous <hi>Arrington-Lanes,</hi> and going on to <hi>Caxton, Huntingdon, Stilton, Stamford, Grantham, Newark, Tuxford,</hi> (called for its Deepneſs, <hi>Tuxford</hi> in the Clays) hold on till we come almoſt to <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> which is the firſt Town in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and there the Country is naturally hard and ſound, being Part of <hi>Shirwood</hi> Foreſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe you had been to take the other <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Road, by <hi>St. Albans, Dunſtable, Hockley, Newport-Pagnel, Northampton, Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> or <hi>Derby:</hi> After you are paſs'd <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> which is about 30 Miles, you uſed to enter the deep Clays, which were ſo ſurpriſingly ſoft, that it was perfectly frightful to Travellers, and had been the Wonder of Foreigners, how, conſidering the great Numbers of Carriages which are continually paſſing with heavy Loads, thoſe Ways have been made practicable. From <hi>Hockley</hi> to <hi>Northampton,</hi> thence to <hi>Harborough</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and thence to the very Banks of <hi>Trent,</hi> theſe terrible Clays continue; at <hi>Nottingham</hi> you are paſt them; and the Foreſt of <hi>Shirwood</hi> naturally yields a hard and pleaſant Road for 30 Miles together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take the ſame Road as it leads to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Weſt-Cheſter,</hi> the deep Clays
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0141100403:254"/>
reach through all the Towns of <hi>Brickhill, Fenny</hi> and <hi>Stony Stratford, Towceſter, Daventry, Hill-Morton,</hi> or <hi>Dunchurch, Coventry, Coleſhill,</hi> and even to <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham,</hi> for near 80 Miles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we took the Road to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> it uſed to be the ſame through the Vale of <hi>Aileſbury</hi> to <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and Weſtward to <hi>Banbury, Keynton,</hi> and the Vale of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> where the Clays reach, with ſome Intermiſſions, even to the Bank of <hi>Severn,</hi> as they do more Northerly quite to <hi>Weſt-Cheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This natural Difficulty of the Soil thro' all the midland Country, where the Carriage at the ſame time was ſo prodigious, and made ſome of the Highways in a manner impaſſable, neceſſarily brought the Country to apply to Parliament; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence has been, that Turnpikes or Toll-bars have been ſet up on the ſeveral great Roads of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> beginning at <hi>London,</hi> and proceeding thro' almoſt all thoſe dirty deep Roads, in the Midland Counties eſpecially; at which Turnpikes all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Droves of Cattle, and Travellers on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, are obliged to pay an eaſy Toll; which bears no Compariſon with the Benefit reap'd thereby: and 'tis well worth recording, for the Honour of the preſent Age, that this Work has been begun, and is in an extraordinary manner carry'd on, and perhaps may, in a great meaſure, be completed within our Memory, as to the worſt and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Roads in the Kingdom. And this is a Work of ſo much general Good, that certainly no publick Edifice, Alms-houſe, Hoſpital, or Nobleman's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, can be of equal Value to the Country with this, nor at the ſame time more an Honour and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it.</p>
            <p>The Benefit of theſe Turnpikes appears now to be ſo great, and the People in all Places begin to be ſo ſenſible of it, that it is incredible what Effect it has already had upon Trade in the Counties where
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0141100403:255"/>
the Roads are completely finiſhed; even the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Goods is abated, in ſome Places, 6<hi>d. per</hi> hundred Weight; in others, 12<hi>d. per</hi> Hundred; which is abundantly more Advantage to Commerce, than the Charge paid amounts to; and yet at the ſame time the Expence is paid by the Carriers too, who make the Abatement; ſo that the Benefit in abating the Rate of Carriage is wholly and ſimply the Tradeſmens, not the Carriers.</p>
            <p>Yet the Advantage is evident to the latter alſo another way; for they can bring more Weight with the ſame Number of Horſes, nor are their Horſes ſo hard-work'd and fatigu'd with their Labour as they were before; in which one Particular 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged by the Carriers, they perform their Work with more Eaſe, and the Maſters are at leſs Expence.</p>
            <p>The Advantage is alſo inexpreſſible to all other kinds of Travelling; ſuch as the Safety and Eaſe to Gentlemen journeying up to <hi>London</hi> on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whether to the Term, to Parliament, to Court, or on any other neceſſary Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Riding Poſt, as well for the ordinary carrying of the Mails, as for Gentlemen, when their Occaſions require Speed, is made extremely eaſy, ſafe and pleaſant, by this Alteration of the Roads.</p>
            <p>The Safety of Travelling on this Occaſion is the more to be inſiſted on, becauſe the Commiſſioners for theſe Repairs of the Highways do daily order Bridges to be repair'd and inlarg'd, and new ones built, where they find Occaſion; which not only ſerve to carry the Water off, where it otherwiſe often ſpreads, and lies, as it were, damm'd up upon the Road, and ſpoils the Way, but where it riſes ſometimes by ſudden Rains to a dangerous Height; for it is to be obſerv'd, that there is more Hazard, and more Lives loſt, in paſſing, or attempting to paſs, little Brooks and Streams, which are ſwell'd by ſudden
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0141100403:256"/>
Showers of Rain, and where Paſſengers expect no Stoppage, than in paſſing great Rivers, where the Danger is known, and therefore more carefully avoided.</p>
            <p>In many of theſe Places the Commiſſioners have not only built large and ſubſtantial Bridges, but have ſet up Sluices to ſtop, and open Chanels to carry off the Waters, where they uſed to ſwell into the Highway: and I have been told, Years ago, that the ſeveral Commiſſioners, in the reſpective Diſtricts, where they are concerned, had then built between 300 and 400 new Bridges, where there were none before, or where the former were ſmall, and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to carry the Traveller ſafe over the Waters. Many of theſe are within a few Miles of <hi>London,</hi> eſpecially, for Example, on the great Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Edgeworth,</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Enfield,</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>St. Albans,</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Croydon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Benefits accruing from this laudable Method, we may add, the Conveniency to thoſe who bring fat Cattle, eſpecially Sheep, to <hi>London</hi> in the Winter, from the remoter Counties of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where they are bred: for, before, the Country Graziers were oblig'd to ſell their Stocks off in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> when the Roads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be bad, and when they generally ſell cheap; and the Butchers and Farmers near <hi>London</hi> uſed to engroſs them, and keep them till <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> and then ſell them, tho' not an Ounce fatter than before, for an advanced Price, to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>; whereas now the Roads are in a Way to be made every-where paſſable, the City will be ſerv'd with Mutton almoſt as cheap in the Winter as in the Summer, or the Profit of the Advance will be to the Country Graziers, who are the original Breeders, and take all the Pains.</p>
            <p>This is evidenced to a Demonſtration in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where the Roads are already repair'd, from
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0141100403:257"/>
whence they bring their fat Cattle, and particularly their Mutton, in Droves, from Sixty, Seventy, or Eighty Miles, without fatiguing, haraſſing, or ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fleſh of the Creatures, even in the Depth of Winter.</p>
            <p>I might give Examples of other Branches of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Commerce, which are, and ſtill will be further alter'd for the better, by this Repairing the Roads, and particularly that of carrying Cheeſe; a Species of Proviſion ſo conſiderable, that nothing, except that of live Cattle, can exceed it.</p>
            <p>This is chiefly made in the Three <hi>North-weſt</hi> Counties of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>Cheſhire, Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and the Parts adjacent, from whence the Nation uſed to be very meanly ſupply'd, by reaſon of the great Diſtance of the Country where the Cheeſe is made, from thoſe where it is chiefly expended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Men indeed carry great Quantities about by long Sea, as they call it, to <hi>London</hi>; a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible long, and ſometimes dangerous, Voyage, being thro' the <hi>Iriſh Chanel,</hi> round all <hi>Wales,</hi> croſs the <hi>Briſtol Chanel,</hi> round the <hi>Land's End</hi> of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> and up the <hi>Engliſh Chanel</hi> to the Mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and ſo up to <hi>London</hi>; or elſe by Land to <hi>Burton upon Trent,</hi> and ſo down that River to <hi>Gainsborough</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> and ſo by Sea to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> Men carry all by Land-Carriage to <hi>Lechlade</hi> and <hi>Cricklade</hi> on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and ſo carry it down the River to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> Men have no Water-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage at all, or at leaſt not till they have carry'd it a long Way by Land to <hi>Oxford</hi>; but as their Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is exceeding great, and they ſupply not only the City of <hi>London,</hi> but alſo the Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Hertford, Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Groſs of their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is by mere dead Draught; and they carry it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0141100403:258"/>
either to <hi>London</hi> by Land, which is full 100 Miles, and ſo the <hi>London</hi> Cheeſemongers ſupply the ſaid Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> beſides <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> by Sea and River Navigation; or the <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> Men carry it by Land once a Year to <hi>Sturbridge</hi> Fair, whence the Shop-keepers of all the Inland Country above-nam'd come to buy it; in all which Caſes Land-Carriage being long, when the Ways were generally bad, it made it very dear to the Poor, who are the chief Conſumers.</p>
            <p>I could alſo inlarge here upon the Convenience that accrues to the Trade in freſh Fiſh, from the Sea Coaſts to the Inner Parts of the Kingdom, whither, when the Ways are bad, they cannot carry them ſweet. This of courſe muſt greatly increaſe the Conſumption of Fiſh in its Seaſon, and imploy a conſiderable Number of Horſes and Men, as well as increaſe the Shipping by that Conſumption.</p>
            <p>By this I do not only mean the carrying of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Mackerel to <hi>London,</hi> as is practiſed on the Coaſts of <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> in particular, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salmon from the remote Rivers of <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi>; but the carrying of Herrings, Mackerel, and Sprats in their Seaſon, and Whitings and flat Fiſh at other times, from the Coaſts of <hi>Yarmouth, Swole, Ipſwich, Colcheſter, Malden,</hi> &amp;c. and ſupplying all the Inland Counties with them ſweet and good, even as far as <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might give Examples where the Herrings, which are not the beſt Fiſh to keep, uſed, even before theſe Reparations were ſet on foot, to be carried to thoſe Towns, and up to <hi>Warwick, Birmingham, Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> and <hi>Stafford</hi>; and tho' they frequently ſtunk before they got thither, yet the People were ſo eager for them, that they bought them up at a dear Rate; whereas when the Roads are every-where good, they will come in leſs Time, by at leaſt Two Days

            <p>Theſe, and many others, are the Advantages to our Inland Commerce, which we may have room to hope for upon the general Repair of the Roads, and which I ſhall have great Occaſion to ſpeak of again in my <hi>Northern</hi> Circuit.</p>
            <p>Nor are the laudable Undertakings which have of late Years been ſet on foot for rendering many of the Inland Rivers of this Kingdom navigable, a leſs profitable Improvement to the Publick, many of which have been completed, and others are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting, according to Acts of Parliament already paſſed for that Purpoſe; many of which I have taken notice of, in the Courſe of my Letters. And hardly a Seſſion paſſes, but Bills are ſtill continued to be brought in for making others navigable. All which muſt greatly tend, with the repairing of the publick Roads, as above, to increaſe the Trade of this Nation.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT nothing may be wanting to complete this Work, I ſhall briefly in this Place touch upon the Iſles of <hi>Jerſey, Guernſey, Alderney</hi> and <hi>Sarke,</hi> which are the only Remains of the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> now in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown. And, firſt, of JER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEY.</p>
            <p>Various Names have been affix'd to this Iſland: in the Time of the <hi>Romans</hi> it was nam'd <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from the Dictator, who ſubdued ſeveral Nations along this Tract: which Conjecture is confirm'd by the preſent Name of one of its Forts, which is <hi>Le Fort de Céſar.</hi> In the North of the Iſland, at <hi>Roſel,</hi> is an Intrenchment preſerving the Name of <hi>La pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite Céſarée.</hi> That the <hi>Romans</hi> were here, is plain from the Remains of an antient Camp near the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Dilament</hi>; as alſo from Coins which have been found in different Parts of the Iſland, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0141100403:265"/>
One of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and Two of <hi>Probus</hi> and <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> all in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Oûen.</hi> Its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Appellation is no more than a Corruption of its old one, <hi>Jer</hi> being a Contraction of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Ey</hi> ſignifying Iſland, q. d. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Iſland. <hi>Augia</hi> was a Name ſtill elder than the Time when the <hi>Romans</hi> were acquainted with the Place; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the original one.</p>
            <p>The Iſland has ſuſtained ſeveral Revolutions: firſt, by <hi>Rollo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy.</hi> 2. By the <hi>French.</hi> 3. By the <hi>Normans</hi> reſtored. 4. By the Uniting of it to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The Inhabitants behav'd very valiantly in Defence of <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his Son <hi>Charles</hi> II. but were at laſt reduced by the irreſiſtible Power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, altho' they are ſuppoſed to have been the laſt who ſubmitted to the common Fate of the Times, by a Capitulation equally advantageous and honourable.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed to give as clear an Account of the Situation and remarkable Places of this Iſland as the Narrowneſs of our Limits will admit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jerſey</hi> is computed to be 49° 10′ N. L. and 2° 20′ W. L. from the Meridian of <hi>London.</hi> Its Length is 12 Miles; its utmoſt Breadth between Six and Seven. Its North-ſide, from its lofty Cliffs, is 40 or 50 Fathoms perpendicular from the Sea; which renders it inacceſſible that way; but the South is much lower, and almoſt level with the Water. Its Form ſeems to reſemble a Wedge, or a rectangular Triangle.</p>
            <p>The higher Lands are diverſify'd by gritty and gravelly, ſtony and rocky, fine and ſweet Mould; the lower by heavy, deep and rich Soil. All kinds of Foreſt and Fruit-trees, Shrubs, Roots, Flowers and Herbs, flouriſh here, with Pulſe and Corn, tho' their Wheat is ſmaller than <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0141100403:266"/>The Decay of Tillage (ſo evident in this Iſle) is owing to three Cauſes: 1. The Increaſe of the Stocken Manufacture; which naturally inclined the People to ſlight the more laborious Imployment of Agriculture. 2. The Improvement of Navigation, and Foreign Traffick, which had the ſame Effect. 3. The Culture of Cyder, by converting the Arable Lands into Orchards for that Purpoſe; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is the ordinary Drink of the Inhabitants, who are now over-ſtock'd with it; ſo that there is Hope of their returning to the Plough, and to their former Induſtry. 4. The Increaſe of Incloſures and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; of the latter whereof here are three Sorts; the firſt call'd <hi>Le Chemin du Roy,</hi> or The King's High-way, ſixteen Feet in Breadth; the ſecond, <hi>Le Chemin de huit Pieds,</hi> or The Eight-foot way, which with its Sides makes up 12 Feet; and the third, <hi>Le Chemin de quatre Pieds,</hi> or the Four-foot Way, for Horſe-carriages.</p>
            <p>On the Rocks about the Iſland, Sea-weed grows plentifully, which is an Equivalent for the Deficiency of other Things uſeful in Huſbandry, and is the common Manure of the Land in <hi>Jerſey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is Plenty of good Water from the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Stores of Springs guſhing from the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Strata</hi> of Rocks every-where conſpicuous. Meat alſo and Butter are equally good and ſweet here, tho' the Cattle are inferior in Size to thoſe elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The Ewes of this Iſle had four Horns, but the Rams ſix, in <hi>Camden</hi>'s Time, tho' rarely now to be ſeen. Fowl of all Kinds are here in great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. But none of the volatile Tribe exceed in Beauty the <hi>Jerſey</hi> Partridge, having the bright Eyes natural to that Bird, red Legs, and variegated Feathers. The Fleſh however is not much preferable to that of the common Partridge.</p>
            <p>This Iſland abounds with Fiſh, the Species of which we may range thus: 1. Rough-coated Fiſh,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0141100403:267"/>
ſuch as Rouſſes, Haus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the coarſeſt of all. 2. Shell and Rock-fiſh, among which is the <hi>Ormer,</hi> ſuppoſed peculiar to theſe Parts, and deriving its Name, which is <hi>French,</hi> from its Reſemblance, to a human Ear. The Inſide of the Shell is made uſe of in inlaid Works, as Mother of Pearl, to the bright Colour of which it approaches. There is no Under-ſhell; but the Fiſh adheres to the Rock with its Back, and is a ſolid Maſs of white Pulp, very grateful to the Taſte, which it regales like the Fleſh of Land Animals. In great Spring Tides, at low-water Mark, it is found. 3. Flat-fiſh, as Rays, Thornbacks, Soles, Plaiſe, large Turbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Scale-fiſh. Of theſe, one Draught of Baſe has equall'd a Cart-load. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which here is the Mullet, red and grey, the Vrac, or Sea-carp, and the Bar, an exquiſite Fiſh, ſometimes two Feet in Length. Other Fiſh here are, which for their Singularity we cannot paſs by in Silence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gronnard</hi> is ſo call'd from its <hi>grunting</hi> Noiſe, when taken. Its Head is almoſt as big as the Body, and its Colour is a deep Scarlet, reſembling Blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lançon</hi> (or <hi>little Lance,</hi> from its Shape) is never found in the Water, but in ſome moving Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank deſerted by the Sea; when the Sand being mov'd with an iron Hook, the Fiſh ſpring up, and are caught by Handfuls. The young Men and Maids take great Delight, during the warm Summer Nights, in this Sport; which is render'd eaſy to them by the Gliſtering of the Prey above the Sand. This they term <hi>aller au Lançon.</hi> It is prepar'd as an Anchovy, and, well-dreſs'd, gives an agreeable Reliſh.</p>
            <p>Another odd Fiſh is the <hi>Sirene,</hi> which is furniſh'd with Teats like a Woman's.</p>
            <p>The ugly, but harmleſs, and perhaps wholſome Animal the Toad, abounds here, as do innoxious Creatures of the Serpentine Kind, particularly Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, which gaze on Paſſengers, as they lie baſking
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0141100403:268"/>
in the Sun. But the worſt of the reptile Kind are Moles, which damage the Corn and Graſs, though they compenſate that Detriment by affording a freer Paſſage to the Rain thro' their <hi>Latibula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Climate here is in general wholſome; tho' as Luxury has gain'd Ground, Diſeaſes unknown to former Ages have been its conſtant Attendants: ſo that it cannot now boaſt of that Character given it by <hi>Camden, That here was no Room for the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rocks are vaſt and terrible, the Tides rapid and ſtrong; as an Evidence of which, here is no Still-water at any time, as in other Parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Chanel.</p>
            <p>The whole Iſland conſiſts of 12 Pariſhes, which are divided into <hi>Vintaines,</hi> from the 20 Houſes which formerly, as is ſaid, conſtituted each Pariſh; tho' now ſome Pariſhes vaſtly exceed that Number. <hi>Cueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes</hi> is the Name for theſe Diviſions in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Oûen</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular: 1. The Pariſh juſt mention'd contains ſix <hi>Cueillettes,</hi> namely, <hi>De Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelés, des Millés, de Leoville, des Grontés, Grande Cueillette,</hi> and <hi>Petite Cueillette.</hi> The Seigneur <hi>de St. Oûen</hi> has a large Pond in the Weſt of the Iſland, containing about 20 Acres of Land, wherein are Carp of ſo extraordinary a Size, as ſcarce to be equalled in <hi>Europe</hi>; ſome of them being four Feet four Inches in Length. Part of the great Bay of <hi>St. Oûen</hi> had been a rich Vale, which was ſwallow'd up by the Sea.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>St. Peter</hi> contains ſix <hi>Vintaines</hi>; which are, <hi>Des Angueres, du Coin Varin, du Doet, de St. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, de la Vallée,</hi> and <hi>Grande Vintaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>St. Brelade</hi> are four <hi>Vintaines</hi>; call'd <hi>Des Quenves, de la Moye, du Coin,</hi> and <hi>de Noirmont.</hi> In this Pariſh ſtands the Town of <hi>St. Aubin,</hi> the ſecond of the Iſland; and from it the Bay adjoining
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0141100403:269"/>
derives its Name; which conſiſts of white Sand, level and firm; and thence the Travelling from this Town to <hi>St. Helier,</hi> the Capital, is render'd ſmooth and eaſy. And as the Church is at a Diſtance, and intercepted by a bleak Hill, the Inhabitants, who are in plentiful Circumſtances, were building, when I was there, a convenient Chapel by way of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. The Port, which is the beſt and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> has a ſtrong Pier, carry'd into the Sea, which receives and affords a ſafe Harbour for Ships. Here a Sixth-rate juſt floats at a dead Neap, and a Ship of 200 Tons at all times. At Half-flood a Veſſel of 130 Tons may find Entrance. Larger Ships indeed, and Men of War, muſt remain in the Road, where is good Anchorage. The Pier joins to the Fort of <hi>St. Aubin,</hi> which renders the Place very defenſible. Theſe Advantages have brought hither many Merchants and Maſters of Ships: and every <hi>Monday</hi> is held what is improperly call'd a Market; for it is rather an Exchange, where Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others meet for tranſacting Affairs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and Traffick. The Houſes are moſtly new.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>St. Mary</hi> has two Vintaines, <hi>Du Nord,</hi> and <hi>du Sud.</hi> In this Pariſh was diſcover'd a Spring ſtrongly impregnated with a purging Mineral; the Water of which was approved of by Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> an eminent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſician.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>St. Laurence</hi> contains four Vintaines; <hi>viz. Du Coin Motier, du Coin Tourgis, du Coin és Haſtains,</hi> and <hi>de la Vallée.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>St. John</hi> has three Vintaines; which are <hi>Du Nord, du Doet, de Herupe.</hi> In this Pariſh is a Hill call'd <hi>Mont-mado,</hi> whereon is a rich Quarry of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Stone, capable of being cut into regular Squares, like <hi>Portland</hi> Stone.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In <hi>Trinity</hi> are five Vintaines, namely, <hi>De la Ville à l' Eveſque, du Rondin, de Roſel, des Augrés,</hi> and <hi>de la Croizerie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0141100403:270"/>8. <hi>St. Helier</hi> comprehends four Vintaines, which are, <hi>Du Mont à l' Abbée, du Mont au Prétre, du Mont Cochon,</hi> and <hi>de la Ville.</hi> The Situation of <hi>St. Helier</hi> is pleaſant as well as commodious, having on the South-weſt the Sea, with a full Proſpect of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Caſtle, and of the Road for Ships. To the North are Hills, which are an excellent Defence againſt the Cold: and at their Feet a Flat of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows inliven'd by a pure Stream, which from hence enters the Streets, and even the Houſes; ſo that the Water is eaſily brought up by Buckets, let down thro' a Trap-door, or from the Reſervoirs of Wells and Pumps. Another huge Hill projects, in a manner, over the Town; and being a Common, affords to the Cattle Herbage, and to Gentlemen and Ladies an agreeable Walk, with the Advantage of an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Proſpect. The uſual Name of this Hill is <hi>Le Mont de la Ville.</hi> The unfortunate Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> Protector of the King and Kingdom, had probably intended to protect himſelf from the Malice of his Enemies, by building a new Town here, as he did a Citadel at <hi>Alderney</hi>; both which Deſigns became abortive by his Death. In <hi>St. Helier,</hi> at preſent, are about 400 Houſes, diſpoſed into divers wide and well-pav'd Streets. <hi>La Cohue Royale,</hi> or the Seat of Juſtice, ſtands in a large Quadrangle, on each Side of which are handſome Structures. Here is held every <hi>Saturday</hi> a Market, or rather a Fair, whither People flock from all Parts of the Iſland to enjoy their Friends, or tranſact Buſineſs. In the Town live few landed Gentlemen, but many Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, Artificers, and Retailers of Liquor. Scarce any thing is wanting to the Uſes of Neceſſity or Convenience. <hi>La Halle, la Boucherie,</hi> or the Shambles, is a large Room incloſed, ſo that the Sight and Smell of Carcaſes do not here annoy the Eyes and Noſtrils of People, as they do in moſt Country Towns. The Number of Inhabitants, excluſive of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0141100403:271"/>
ſome Hundreds in the Out-Vintaines, who are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, tho' not Townſmen, is ſuppoſed to amount to Two thouſand. And the Church, tho' very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious by the Acceſſion of Galleries, when I was there, was crouded with them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>St. Saviour</hi> has ſix Vintaines, of the following Denominations: <hi>De Maufant, de ſous la Hogue, des Pigneaux, de ſous l' Egliſe, de le Grande Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and <hi>de la Petite Longueville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Under <hi>St. Martin</hi> are comprehended theſe five Vintaines: <hi>De Roſel, de la Queruée, de ſous l' Egliſe, du Fief du Roy,</hi> and <hi>de Faldoit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Gronville</hi> compriſes four Vintaines, <hi>De la Rue, des Marais, de Longueville,</hi> and <hi>de la Roque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. In <hi>St. Clement</hi> are three Vintaines, by Name, <hi>Du Mont Roquier, de Samaréz,</hi> and <hi>Grand Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> In the Canal call'd <hi>Samaréz</hi> are great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Carp and Eel, the only freſh-water Fiſh in the Iſland.</p>
            <p>The Cueillettes and Vintaines are in all 52. The Buildings are all of Stone, as may well be ſuppoſed, in a Country which is nothing but a huge Rock, cover'd with <hi>Strata</hi> of Earth. The common Sort is Rag-ſtone. The Stone on <hi>Mont-mado,</hi> mention'd above, is of a reddiſh White, the whiter the better, of a fine Grain, and may be wrought almoſt as ſleek as poliſh'd Marble. The Churches and fineſt Edifices are cover'd with blue Slate; the ordinary Houſes are thatch'd with long Wheat-ſtraw.</p>
            <p>The principal Trade is that to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> whither, in the Year 1732, were ſent 27 Ships, from thence to proceed to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> in order to diſpoſe of their Fiſh. Another Branch of Trade is that of knit Hoſe, or Stockens, which are every <hi>Saturday</hi> ſold at <hi>St. Helier,</hi> to the Merchants; and many thouſand Pairs are made weekly in the Iſland.</p>
            <p>The Language, as you may gueſs from the Names of Places, is <hi>French,</hi> tho' obſolete, and thence to be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0141100403:272"/>
eſteem'd barbarous. This Remark, however, is not to be extended to their Religious Worſhip, Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or even the Converſation of the more polite, in all which the pure <hi>French</hi> is uſed. Tho' this is the original Language, yet one may obſerve a pretty good Smattering of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> even among the lower Claſs of People, owing to the Intermixture of the Soldiers in the Gariſon at <hi>St. Helier</hi>; in the Church of which Town Prayers are alternately in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief Officer, who repreſents the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is the Governor. His Excellency, at the Time when I was there, was the Right Honourable the Lord Viſcount <hi>Cobham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harliſton</hi> Tower was ſo call'd from Sir <hi>Richard Harliſton,</hi> Governor of the Iſland in the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who built it in <hi>Mont Orgueil</hi> Caſtle. The great Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> bore this high Office, to which his Name does Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mont-Orgueil</hi> is of ſo great Antiquity, that no Record ſubſiſts, old enough to determine its Origin. 'Tis at preſent ſlighted, and in a ruinous Condition; and what it was formerly, <hi>Elizabeth-Caſtle</hi> now is, equal to any Fortreſs within the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions. It is nam'd <hi>Le Château de l' Iſlet,</hi> or ſimply <hi>L' Iſlet,</hi> from its Situation on a ſmall Iſland. In Circuit it is little leſs than a Mile. In 1551 all the Bells in <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> excepting one to each Church, were ſold towards defraying the Expence of the Building. In 1586 the <hi>Upper Ward</hi> was erected, which is properly Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Caſtle, every Houſe in the Iſland furniſhing four Days Work. The <hi>Lower Ward</hi> is King <hi>Charles</hi> I.'s Caſtle, and was begun in 1626. During the Civil War <hi>Charles-Fort</hi> was added; and in 1665, the <hi>French</hi> threatening the Place, the <hi>Green</hi> was incloſed within a Wall.</p>
            <p>The Fort of <hi>St. Aubin</hi> is of good Uſe towards clearing the Road, and for a Safe-guard to Ships
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0141100403:273"/>
within the Pier, which it ſecures by its Cannon planted on the Baſtions; tho' in antient Times it was no more than a great Tower on a Rock, thence nam'd <hi>La Tour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are five Regiments of regular Forces on the Iſland, which are reviewed every 29th of <hi>May,</hi> the Anniverſary of the Reſtoration.</p>
            <p>The Civil Government is adminiſter'd by a Bailly, aſſiſted by 12 Jurats.</p>
            <p>Here are divers Monuments of the <hi>Druidical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,</hi> which are flat Rag-ſtones, of vaſt Size and Weight, raiſed three or four Feet from the Ground, and ſuſtain'd by others of leſs Bulk. Theſe the Natives call <hi>Poquelayes</hi>; and are the Altars, on which Sacrifices, often human, were immolated, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Helier,</hi> three of them contiguous to each other; and on the Summit of a Place call'd <hi>Le Rouge Bouillon,</hi> another; beſides one on <hi>St. Helier's Hill.</hi> Another larger, near <hi>Mont-Orgueil</hi> Caſtle; and near <hi>Roſel-haven,</hi> on a Cliff nam'd <hi>Le Couperon,</hi> an Antiquity ſeeming to be a little Temple of theirs. At a Place call'd <hi>Les Landes Pallot,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Saviour,</hi> was a Rocking-ſtone, like that I ſhall mention in <hi>Scotland,</hi> deſtroy'd by the <hi>Cromwellians</hi>; erected by the <hi>Druids,</hi> probably to awe the People into a Belief of their Miracles. This alſo has been demoliſh'd.</p>
            <p>Here are alſo Monuments of the <hi>Popiſh Superſtition</hi>; two more particularly: The firſt call'd <hi>La Chapelle de nôtre Dame des Pas,</hi> from the Bleſſed Virgin, who is ſaid to have left the Print of her Steps on the very Spot of the Rock, whereon the Chapel is erected, and this too after her Body was moulder'd into Duſt. The ſecond is term'd <hi>Hoguebie,</hi> a Chapel over a Tomb, built, according to Tradition, by the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Widow of the <hi>Seigneur de Hambie,</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> who fell by Treachery in this Iſland, and whoſe Loſs was ſo afflicting to his Lady, that ſhe erected it on
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0141100403:274"/>
Purpoſe to have the melancholy Pleaſure of ſeeing the Place where her Lord's Corps was interr'd, from her Window in <hi>Normandy</hi>; and to procure his Soul the great Benefit of Maſſes. Afterwards one <hi>Mabon,</hi> who had been a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took a Fancy to lengthen the Chapel toward the Eaſt, and to hollow a Place under the Altar, in order to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Lord's Sepulchre. This Place was made the chief Seat of the Popiſh Deluſion.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the prevailing Terrors of the Papal Empire in the Days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Magiſtrates of <hi>Jerſey</hi> had the Courage to put to Death <hi>Richard Averty,</hi> a Prieſt, and furious Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the marry'd Clergy, for murdering his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Child, which he effected without the Mother's Knowlege.</p>
            <p>The Mace, borne before the Bailly and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, at the Convention of the States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has this Inſcription:

<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>— Not all are with ſuch Honour grac'd.</hi>
                  </l> CHARLES the Second, the moſt ſerene King of <hi>Great Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> has reſolved,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0141100403:275"/>
that his Royal Favour towards the Iſle of JER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEY, (in which he twice met with a Place of Refuge, while he was excluded from the reſt of his Dominions) ſhould be conſecrated to Poſterity by this truly Royal Monument: And commanded, that thenceforward it ſhould be borne before the Baillies, in perpetual Memory of the Loyalty preſerv'd both to his moſt Auguſt Father CHARLES I. and to his Majeſty, during the Rage of the Civil Wars, by the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and Sir <hi>George de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret,</hi> Knights, Baillies and Chief Governors of this Iſland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Magloire,</hi> the Apoſtle of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> lies bury'd in a little Chapel near a Free-ſchool, corruptly call'd from him <hi>L' Ecole de St. Magloire,</hi> and founded, with another nam'd <hi>St. Anaſtaſe,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who granted a Charter for that uſeful Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This Place gives Title of Earl to the Lord Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Villiers,</hi> the ſecond who has enjoy'd that Dignity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The next Iſle I am to ſpeak of is GUERNSEY, the antient Name of which was <hi>Sarnia.</hi> From <hi>Jerſey</hi> it is diſtant 20 Miles to the North-weſt; yet equals not the former, either in point of Fruitfulneſs, or Extent of Territory; for it has but 10 Pariſhes. This Advantage however it enjoys above <hi>Jerſey,</hi> That here no venomous Creatures can ſubſiſt. It is alſo naturally better fortify'd from Invaſion, by craggy Rocks and Precipices. On the contrary, its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, compar'd with that of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> renders this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior; for whereas the North of <hi>Jerſey</hi> is much higher than the South, as we have ſaid, the South Side of <hi>Guernſey</hi> is high, and the North low; which produces a double Obliquity of the Sun and Land; and hence the Difference in the Soil and Air of each.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0141100403:276"/>
Notwithſtanding this they both agree as to their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, their Productions, and the Civil, Military and Eccleſiaſtical Government. Among the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Rocks is found the ſharp and hard Stone call'd <hi>Smyris,</hi> or <hi>Emeril,</hi> and uſed by Glaziers for cutting Glaſs, as well as by Jewellers for poliſhing their Work.</p>
            <p>In Trade it is ſuperior to its Neighbour <hi>Jerſey,</hi> by having a more convenient Port at its Eaſtern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, adjoining to the South; where the Shore retiring inward in the Form of a Creſcent, makes the Place capable of holding large Veſſels. The Foundation of its Pier was laid in the Beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> I.'s Reign by prodigious Stones, heap'd on each other to a conſiderable Height, and regularly cemented. The Shipping here is not only ſafe, and may be brought cloſe up to the Town, which we ſhall preſently mention; but the Pier itſelf is adorn'd with large ſmooth Flags, and guarded by Parapets; ſo that being of ſufficient Length and Breadth, it is uſed as the chief Place for Rendezvouſes on Parties of Pleaſure by the faſhionable People of the Town, as well as for its noble Proſpect over the Sea, and adjacent Iſles.</p>
            <p>On the Right-ſide of the Port ſtands <hi>Cornet-Caſtle,</hi> which at high Tides is ſurrounded by the Sea. Sir <hi>Leonard Chamberlan,</hi> who was Governor of <hi>Guernſey,</hi> in <hi>Mary</hi> I.'s Time, and his Succeſſor, Sir <hi>Thomas Leighton,</hi> improved it with Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In the Year 1672, the Governor Lord Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Hatton</hi> loſt his Lady, and himſelf eſcaped with great Difficulty, from a prodigious Storm of Lightning, which, catching the Powder-ſtore, blew up the lofty Tower with the Standard; ſo that the Caſtle muſt have formerly made a much more grand Appearance than at preſent. However, what it wants in Beauty, it makes up in real Uſefulneſs; for it has the Command of the Town and Harbour;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0141100403:277"/>
and its Situation alone renders it ſtrong, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Land by an Arm of the Sea about 600 Yards wide, except in great Spring-tides, when it is fordable.</p>
            <p>On the Left-ſide too is a mean old Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The only Town is call'd <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s, has a free Trade, (which is however render'd ineffectual by Privateering) has a Market, is well ſtor'd with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of War, and conſiſts of one long Street, which is narrow, being confin'd between the Sea and the impending Hills. The Market is always plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſupply'd with Fiſh.</p>
            <p>To the North, joins a Peninſula nam'd <hi>Le Val,</hi> where once was a Priory. And</p>
            <p>To the Weſt, near the Sea, is a Lake, a Mile and a half in Circumference, ſtock'd with Fiſh, eſpecially a kind of Carp of extraordinary Size, and delicious to the Taſte.</p>
            <p>The Governor of <hi>Guernſey</hi> was (when I was on the Spot) the late Marquis of <hi>Montandre</hi>; and his Lieutenant, <hi>John Graham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>From hence the Second Son of <hi>Heneage,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and Lord High Chancellor, by Name <hi>Heneage Finch,</hi> was promoted to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> by the Style of Baron of <hi>Guernſey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Guernſey</hi> there are Eight Miniſters to its Ten Pariſhes, Four of them being united.</p>
            <p>I cannot take Leave of this Iſland without a ſhort Recital of a <hi>flagrant</hi> Inſtance of Popiſh Inhumanity, which, not content to roll in Seas of Blood, all over <hi>England,</hi> extended itſelf to this remote Corner. The Fact was thus: In the Days of that Firebrand of her Country, <hi>Mary</hi> I. a poor Widow, and her Two Daughters, one the Wife of <hi>Perrotine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> a Miniſter, who had happily eſcaped the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Fate by leaving his native Soil, were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to the Stake for what was call'd <hi>Hereſy.</hi> The
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0141100403:278"/>
marry'd Woman's Body, during the Execution, burſting, by the Violence of the Flames, diſcharg'd the Pledge of her conjugal Affection, a beautiful Male Infant, which was haſtily caught up by the Miniſters of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and carried before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, whoſe <hi>tender Mercies</hi> commanded, That it ſhould be thrown in with the Mother, which was accordingly done. <hi>Hoc fera religio potuit ſuadere malorum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> How far the Practices of this Sect may have been changed by the Illumination of <hi>Truth,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Faggots,</hi> notwithſtanding their obſtinate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in their former <hi>Principles,</hi> I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine: but ſure I am, That from bad <hi>Principles</hi> to bad <hi>Practices</hi> the Tranſition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely eaſy; and Experience has more than once, eſpecially within the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, teſtify'd the Truth of this Obſervation. I now proceed to mention (tho' very briefly) an Iſle dependent on the Government of <hi>Guernſey.</hi> This is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. ALDERNEY, ſuppoſed by <hi>Camden,</hi> to be the <hi>Arica</hi> of <hi>Antoninus</hi>; by others the <hi>Ebodia</hi> or <hi>Evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> of <hi>P. Diaconus.</hi> It is ſituated about a League and a half from <hi>Cape la Hogue</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi>; is in Circumference about Eight Miles; and contains One Church with a Town, in which are about 200 Houſes, which lodge to the Number of 1000 Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The Soil is good for Paſture or Arable. And I was ſhewn one Field here of about 500 Acres, which, as I was told, had not once lain fallow for 100 Years before. Their Manure is Sea-weed, call'd <hi>Vraic,</hi> of which we have taken notice above. The Land lies high; and to the South is a Harbour, admitting only ſmall Veſſels.</p>
            <p>The Streight which divides this Iſle from <hi>France,</hi> term'd <hi>Le Ras de Blanchart,</hi> or <hi>The Race of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> is eſteem'd a dangerous Paſſage in ſtormy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Winds happen to encounter with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0141100403:279"/>
the ſtrong Currents. In calm Seaſons it is very ſafe, and the largeſt Ships may ride here with Eaſe. Nay, in 1692-3, Part of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet eſcap'd this Way, after the Blow they had met with at <hi>la Hogue.</hi> The laſt Place I ſhall mention in this Letter, is the Iſle of,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. SARKE, which, as well as <hi>Alderney,</hi> is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the Government of <hi>Guernſey.</hi> It is no more than Two Miles in Length, and is ſituated in the midſt of all the others, and guarded with ſteep Rocks. Its Corn is excellent, the Land very high, which, together with its Situation, renders it one of the ſtrongeſt Places in the World. Its Water is very good. Formerly here was no Way for Draughts and Carriages from the Sea, till <hi>Philip de Carteret, Seigneur ae St. Oúen,</hi> (who had a Grant of the Iſland from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in whoſe Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants the Property is veſted) cauſed one to be cut thro' the impending Cliff, which for ſome Space is carry'd on in ſubterranean Darkneſs, till it emerges within the Iſland, and is fortify'd with Cannon, and by a Gate. In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. was ſtanding the Convent of <hi>St. Magloire,</hi> with a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Exchequer, where that holy Perſon is ſaid to have reſided.</p>
            <p>The Iſland fell into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> but in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> I. was recover'd; and the Inhabitants have ever ſince enjoy'd the mild Influence of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government, equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of their preſent happy Condition, and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fetters of <hi>French</hi> Slavery. Their Number amounts to about 300; and one Miniſter performs their divine Offices. Thus, having completed what I promiſed, I reſt from my TOUR, and am,</p>

And we ſhall now inſert the following Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles under this Title; but which, however, may be incorporated in their proper Places, in future Editions of this Work.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin with a brief Deſcription of the famous Gardens of the Right Hon. the Lord Viſcount <hi>Cobham,</hi> at <hi>Stow</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire.</hi>

               <head>VOL. II. p. 105.</head>
               <p>WE enter'd on the South-ſide of the Garden, between Two ſquare Pavilions of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, the Work of Sir <hi>John Vanbrugh</hi>; and were ſtruck with the ſurpriſing Grandeur and Variety of the Objects that preſented themſelves to our View, of which I ſhall give a brief Account in Order, as we paſſed them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, in the Middle of a large Octagon Piece of Water, ſtands an Obeliſk of near 70 Feet,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0141100403:281"/>
which is deſign'd for a <hi>Jet-d' Eau</hi> to caſcade from the Top of it. At a good Diſtance we beheld Two beautiful Rivers, which join, and enter the Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in One Stream. Over One of the Rivers is a <hi>Palladian</hi> Bridge, which is an agreeable Object. A <hi>Gothick</hi> Building, 70 Feet high, preſents itſelf on the Summit of a fine Hill; which, we were told, is intended to be dedicated to <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we had likewiſe a View of the South Front of the Houſe, up an Avenue of ſtately Trees; but great Objections have been made to the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, which is, no doubt, an eſſential Fault. However, ſince every Tree may be deem'd a ſort of Obeliſk to the Honour of the noble Planter, it makes a good Excuſe for their ſtanding; and the rather, as, if they were taken away, it would create an Evil, which could not be remedied in 40 Years.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Gothick</hi> Building is on the Right-hand, ſo on the Leſt appears an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pyramid, dedicated to the Memory of Sir <hi>John Vanbrugh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, here is ſuch a Scene of Magnificence and Nature diſplay'd, the Fields abounding with Cattle, the Trees and Water ſo delightfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, and ſuch a charming Verdure, Symmetry, and Proportion, every-where preſenting to the Eye, that the Judgment is agreeably puzzled, which ſingly to prefer of ſo many collected Beauties.</p>
               <p>Leaving this Point, and on the Left-hand paſſing by Three Statues, we came to the Cold-bath, from whence we beheld a natural Caſcade falling down from the before-mentioned Octagon, in Three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sheets of Water, into a large Lake. One of the Sheets glides thro' an Arch, or Piece of Ruin, which is moſtly hid by a Clump of Ever-greens; but his Lordſhip, as we are told, deſigns to make a good deal of Amendment to it, tho' at preſent it has a very natural and agreeable Appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0141100403:282"/>From hence we proceeded to the Hermitage, which is agreeably ſituated in a riſing Wood, and by the Side of the Lake; and paſſing thro' the Wood, we came to the Statues of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> fronting the <hi>Veneris Hortus,</hi> a very neat Structure, deſigned by Mr. <hi>Kent,</hi> the Inſide of it painted by Mr. <hi>Sleats</hi>; and on the Frize is the following Motto, alluding to the Painting in the Cave:
<q>
                     <l>Nunc amet, qui nondum amavit;</l>
                     <l>Quique amavit, nunc amet.</l>
                  </q> Which is,
<q>
                     <l>He who ne'er lov'd, a Lover grow;</l>
                     <l>And he who has — continue ſo.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is likewiſe a <hi>Sophia.</hi> Each Way, from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Room, is a handſome Colonnade, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſquare Tabernacles or Pavilions. Here are alſo Four venerable antique Buſtoes, of <hi>Veſpaſian, Nero, Cleopatra,</hi> and <hi>Fauſtina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence to the Head of the Lake we had a pleaſant View of the Caſcade; and from hence to <hi>Gibbs</hi>'s Building, or the <hi>Belvidere,</hi> which is placed on the Top of the Mount, is a noble Proſpect of the Houſe, the Church, the Effigies of his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the late Queen; the Rotonda; the Caſtle, which a Farmer now inhabits, and was built for that Purpoſe; but on account of its being ſeated on the Side of a fine riſing Hill, makes a beautiful Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as well from hence, as from many other Places.</p>
               <p>In the Garden is likewiſe the Temple of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> from which the Pavilion at the Entrance, the Caſcade, the Lake, one of the Fields that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the Garden, all together afford a Scene truly charming.</p>
               <p>From hence to <hi>Boycoat</hi> Buildings, paſſing thro' a pleaſant Wood with ſeveral agreeable Proſpects into the Country, we ſaw on our Right-hand a noble
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0141100403:283"/>
Terrace. One of the Buildings is a very good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Houſe; the other ſtands on a ſquare Bottom in the Garden; and in the Inſide of it are Four Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, at full Length, in Niches; viz. <hi>Cicero, Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina, Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Livia.</hi> The Buildings are both finiſh'd with pyramidical Tops, by <hi>Gibbs.</hi> Betwixt them is a very handſome Gate-way, which is the ſecond Entrance to the Houſe, from which leads up a noble Avenue, planted with double Lines of thriving Trees.</p>
               <p>From hence to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pyramid mentioned before, which is 60 Feet high, and about half Way up, is this Inſcription in very large Characters:
<q>Inter plurima hortorum horum aedificia a JO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HANNE VANBRUGH, equite, deſignata, hanc pyramidem illius memoriae ſacram eſſe voluit COBHAM.</q> In <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus:
<q>Among a very great Number of Structures in theſe Gardens, deſigned by Sir JOHN VAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRUGH, Knight, COBHAM thought fit, that this Pyramid ſhould be ſacred to his Memory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Inſide of the Building is the following Inſcription:
<q>
                     <l>Luſiſti ſatis, ediſti ſatis, atque bibiſti:</l>
                     <l>Tempus abire tibi eſt; ne potum largius aequo</l>
                     <l>Rideat &amp; pulſet laſciva decentius aetas.</l>
                  </q> Which may be thus tranſlated:
<q>
                     <l>Enough you've ſported, quaff'd the Bowl, and eat:</l>
                     <l>'Tis Time that from the Banquet you retreat;</l>
                     <l>Leſt Youth, more fitly frolickſome, may join</l>
                     <l>To puſh you, reeling under Loads of Wine.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From hence going along a ſort of Fortification Walk on our Left-hand, the Wood on the other
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0141100403:284"/>
Hand, we enter'd the Field, which is incloſed in a military Way, with a ſtaked Fence. At the firſt Angle, on the middle of the Gravel-walk, are the Statues of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Antëus.</hi> Hence we proceeded to <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi>'s Cave, which is a Building of Roots of Trees and Moſs; and in it a Straw Couch with Three Inſcriptions in <hi>Monkiſh Latin</hi> Verſe. It is placed in a natural Wood, and from the Oddneſs of the Fabrick, and the agreeable Simplicity which is round it, makes a very entertaining Variety.</p>
               <p>Leaving this Place, we approached a Building of a very different Nature — the Temple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> built of Brick, with Paintings in the Inſide alluding to the Name. Here we had a fine diſtant Proſpect toward <hi>Ayleſbury</hi> and <hi>Wendover</hi> Hills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Garden we had in full View the Temple of <hi>Venus:</hi> and between the Two is an Obeliſk erected to the Memory of a Clergyman, with this Inſcription:
<q>
                     <hi>To the Memory of</hi> ROBIN COUCHER.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We proceeded from hence to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Temple, which is a ſolemn Grove with the Seven <hi>Saxon</hi> Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſiding over the ſeveral Days of the Week, placed in Niches; and in the Middle of them ſtands an Altar, as for Sacrifice. All the Statues are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely good, and this Scene agreeably ſtrikes the Mind with Serenity and Compoſure.</p>
               <p>Our Eye, after being confined in the Wood, breaking at once out of it, we were ſurpriſed with a fine open Country on the North: on the South, the Rotonda appears: on the Weſt, the <hi>Boycoat</hi> Buildings: on the Eaſt, the Equeſtrian Statue of the late King, which ſtands in the Front of the Houſe. Theſe Objects preſent themſelves from <hi>Nelſon's</hi> Seat, which is an oblong ſquare Receſs in a Clump of Ever-greens. To the South-eaſt is a View of the Manſion-houſe, which is an extraordinary good one; but, his Lordſhip annually adding to and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0141100403:285"/>
it, one may ſafely ſay, that it will not be much inferior to the beſt Houſe in <hi>England,</hi> if his Lordſhip's Deſign be finiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Offices on the North-ſide are all incloſed within a moſt elegant Wall, with Niches, and grand Gate-ways into the Offices and Gardens. The Houſe and Offices, when perfected, will be about 640 Feet in Length, fronting North and South. As <hi>Nelſon</hi>'s Seat lies to the North-weſt from the Portico of the Houſe, there is on the North-eaſt a new Baſtion building to anſwer it; and ſome grand Walks are now making by the Side of a fine Lawn, from which we ſee numerous Herds of Deer. A Semicircle of fine Timber appears at ſome Miles Diſtance with an agreeable Country between.</p>
               <p>On the South Front of the Houſe is a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Parterre, decorated with <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muſes, gilt Veſſels, and Two Orangeries: but it is likely this will be intirely altered; for if the lower End is laid open, there will appear a noble Scene, where Nature and Art are curiouſly blended.</p>
               <p>The next Object of our View was a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Column, on which is the Statue of his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, with this Inſcription:
<q>GEORGIO AVGVSTO.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we had a moſt delightful Proſpect over the Country; and in the Garden ſeveral of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings preſent themſelves with great Pomp. The Lake, whoſe Bounds are beautifully concealed, adds much to the general Agreeableneſs of the Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dido</hi>'s Cave was the next Subject of our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this is a Stone Building, in a Wood, and raiſed on a ſort of Amphitheatre, with this Inſcription:
<q>
                     <l>Speluncam <hi>Dido,</hi> dux &amp; <hi>Trojanus,</hi> eandem</l>
                     <l>Deveniunt —.</l>
                  </q> 
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0141100403:286"/>In <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus:
<q>
                     <l>Repairing to the ſame dark Cave are ſeen,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Trojan</hi> Hero, and the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Queen.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From hence we advanced to the Rotonda, which is a neat airy Building by Sir <hi>John Vanbrugh.</hi> The Dome of it ſupported on Ten <hi>Dorick</hi> Columns; and in the Centre, ſtanding on a circular Pedeſtal, a <hi>Venus à Medicis.</hi> From this Place we had a View of Part of the Octagon; the Lake, the Fields, and ſeveral of the Buildings, preſenting themſelves alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately as we turned ourſelves round.</p>
               <p>As we went from hence to the late Queen's Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by the Side of a Canal, we were delighted with an Alteration of his Lordſhip's; <hi>viz.</hi> On each Side the Ground is broken, and planted with Clumps of various kinds of Trees, intermixt with Statues, which are promiſcuouſly placed. Her late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Effigies is erected on Four <hi>Ionick</hi> Columns, which are placed on a large Pedeſtal, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in Golden Letters:
<q>Honori, Laudi, Virtuti Divae CAROLINAE.</q>
                  <q>To the Honour, Praiſe, and Virtue of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine CAROLINE.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſituated on a neat Amphitheatre of Slopes, with paſtoral Figures each Way from it. Nature and Art here, joining together, make an agreeable Contraſte.</p>
               <p>Next we were led into the Sleeping Parlour, which is a ſquare Building placed in a Wood with Six Walks centring in it. Within, are painted the <hi>Caeſars</hi> Heads, with ſeveral Feſtons of Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the Frize is this Inſcription:
<q>Cum omnia ſint in incerto, ſave tibi.</q> Which is,
<q>Since all Things are uncertain, indulge thyſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0141100403:287"/>Leaving this Place, and croſſing the Avenue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, from the Pavilions we came to the Witch-houſe, a ſquare Building, the Inſide of which is painted by my Lord's Gentleman, with ſeveral Devices alluding to the Name.</p>
               <p>We arrived next at the Temple of <hi>Antient Virtue,</hi> a Rotonda of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, by Mr. <hi>Kent:</hi> and in Four Niches, ſtanding at full Lengths, are the Four following Statues; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. EPAMINONDAS, with this Inſcription over his Head:
<q>Cujus a virtute, prudentia, verecundia,<lb/>Thebanorum reſpublica<lb/>Libertatem ſimul &amp; imperium,<lb/>Diſciplinam bellicam, civilem &amp; domeſticam,<lb/>Accepit;<lb/>Eoque amiſſo, perdidit.</q> That is,
<q>From whoſe Valour, Prudence, and Moderation, the Republick of <hi>Thebes</hi> received both Liberty and Empire, its military, civil, and domeſtick Diſcipline; and, with him, loſt them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. LYCURGUS, with this:
<q>Qui ſummo cum conſilio inventis legibus,<lb/>Omnemque contra corruptelam munitis optime,<lb/>Pater patriae,<lb/>Libertatem firmiſſimam,<lb/>Et mores ſanctiſſimos,<lb/>Expulſa cum divitiis avaritia, luxuria, libidine,<lb/>In multa ſecula<lb/>Civibus ſuis inſtituit.</q> Thus tranſlated:
<q>Who having invented Laws with the greateſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and moſt excellently fenced them againſt all Corruption, as a Father of his Country, inſtituted for his Countrymen the firmeſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſoundeſt Morality, which endured

for many Ages, he having, together with Riches, baniſhed Avarice, Luxury, and Luſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. SOCRATES,
<q>Qui corruptiſſima in civitate innocens,<lb/>Bonorum hortator, unici cultor DEI,<lb/>Ab inutili otio, &amp; vanis diſputationibus,<lb/>Ad officia vitae, &amp; ſocietatis commoda,<lb/>Philoſophiam avocavit,<lb/>Hominum ſapientiſſimus.</q> That is,
<q>Who being innocent in a moſt corrupt State, an Encourager of the Good, a Worſhipper of One only GOD, as the wiſeſt of Men, reduced Philoſophy from uſeleſs Indolence, and vain Diſputations, to the Duties of Life, and the Advantages of Society.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. HOMERUS,
<q>Qui poetarum princeps, idem &amp; maximus,<lb/>Virtutis praeco, &amp; immortalitatis largitor,<lb/>Divino carmine,<lb/>Ad pulcre audendum, &amp; patiendum fortiter,<lb/>Omnibus notus gentibus, omnes incitat.</q> Thus rendered:
<q>Who being the Firſt of Poets, as he was the greateſt, the Herald of Virtue, and Beſtower of Immortality, known to all Nations, incites all, in a Divine Poem, honourably to dare, and reſolutely to ſuffer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Over one Door is this Inſcription:
<q>Charum eſſe civem, bene de republica mereri, laudari, coli, diligi, glorioſum eſt: metui vero, &amp; in odio eſſe, invidioſum, deteſtabile, imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, caducum.</q> Which is:
<q>To be dear to our Country, to deſerve well of the State, to be praiſed, honoured, and beloved,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0141100403:289"/>
is glorious: but to be dreaded, and hated, is matter of Ill-will, deteſtable, weak, ruinous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Over the other Door this:
<q>Juſtitiam cole &amp; pietatem, quae cum ſit magna in parentibus &amp; propinquis, tum in patria maxima eſt. Ea vita via eſt in coelum, &amp; in hunc coetum eorum, qui jam vixerunt.</q> In <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus:
<q>Maintain Juſtice, and thy relative Duty; which, as it is great, when exerciſed toward our Parents and Kindred, ſo is greateſt toward our Country. That Life is the Way to Heaven, and to this Aſſembly of thoſe, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lived.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this Place we had no diſtant Proſpect, but, notwithſtanding that, it abounds with laſting Beauties: it is really placed in a ſort of Paradiſe; and, Things riſing adequate to that Name, you ſee <hi>Friendſhip</hi> flouriſhing in immortal Youth; in the <hi>Elyſian Fields</hi> are many great and virtuous Mens Names perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves in <hi>this</hi> World by anſwering the End of their Creation. Near this Place alſo is a good Emblem of thoſe who have deviated from it, in the Ruin. Here are ſweet purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Streams, reſembling the melodious Sounds of Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were now not far from the Pariſh Church, which is ſo cloſely ſurrounded with a Wood, as not to be ſeen. From hence we came to the Side of a River, where
<q>
                     <l>Unpoliſh'd Nature cannot boaſt a Part;</l>
                     <l>For Chance too regular, too rude for Art.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And by its winding Banks we were led up to a Grotto, which is to be decorated with Shells, Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Minerals. Here is likewiſe a Shell-pavilion,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0141100403:290"/>
the Dome of which is ſupported by Six wreathed Columns. The Inſide of it hath ſeveral Marks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from Shells, and divers other Imbelliſhments. On the oppoſite Side is to be another of Pebbles.</p>
               <p>Hence we proceeded to the Three-arch'd Building, which is a pleaſant Receſs, by the Banks of the River; and in paſſing we ſaw <hi>Antient Virtue</hi> peeping on the South-ſide of us. The Church we had in full View on the Weſt. To the Eaſt is ſituated the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Houſe, a Building in the Pond, the Out-ſide of it painted very ingeniouſly, in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Taſte, by the celebrated Mr. <hi>Sleats.</hi> The Inſide of it is <hi>Indian</hi> Japan.</p>
               <p>The Shell Bridge led us from hence into the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> the moſt charming Place that ever Eyes beheld. It may not be improper here to give the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines, which were left by an unknown Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, on his Entrance into them:

               <p>Croſſing the Field to the <hi>Gothick</hi> Building before deſcribed, we had a boundleſs Proſpect round the Building. From hence we deſcended a fine Hill; and on our Left-hand ſaw a Plantation of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens; on our Right the Well deſigned, and Rivers deſcribed from the Pavilion. This Walk led us down to a very handſome Bridge over one of the Rivers. The Roof on the Side facing the Water is ſupported by <hi>Ionick</hi> Columns; the Back-ſide of it by an <hi>Alto-Relievo</hi> of the Four Quarters of the World, bringing their Products to <hi>Britannia.</hi> Here are likewiſe painted by Mr. <hi>Sleats,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> with a Map of <hi>Virginia</hi> in his Hand; and Sir <hi>William Penn,</hi> holding a Book ſtyled <hi>The Laws of</hi> Penſylvania.

                  <p>Inſtead of what is there ſaid, of the Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi>'s Seat at <hi>Chiſwick,</hi> inſert the following.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT I muſt not paſs over ſo ſlightly the noble Seat of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>; which was a plain, uſeful Houſe, with a Number of good Offices about it: but as a Part of the old Houſe was deſtroyed ſome Years ago, by Fire, his Lordſhip erected a moſt beautiful Villa, near to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0141100403:297"/>
the old Houſe; which for Elegance of Taſte ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes every thing of its kind in <hi>England,</hi> if not in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Court in Front of the Houſe is of a proportionable Size to the Building, which is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and kept always very neat. On each Side are Yew Hedges, in Panels, with <hi>Termini,</hi> placed at proper Diſtance; in Front of which are planted two Rows of Cedars of <hi>Libanus,</hi> which at preſent have a fine Effect to the Eye, at a ſmall Diſtance from the Houſe; for the dark Shade of theſe ſolemn ever-green Trees occaſions a fine Contraſte with the elegant white Building which appears between them.</p>
               <p>The Aſcent to the Houſe is by a noble Flight of Stone Steps, on one Side of which is the Statue of <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> and on the other that of <hi>Palladio.</hi> The Portico is ſupported by fine fluted Pillars of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Order, and the Cornice, Frize, and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trave are as rich as poſſible; ſo that the Front of this Building ſtrikes every Perſon (tho' not a nice Judge of Architecture) with uncommon Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The other Front towards the Garden is plainer, but yet is very bold and grand, having a pleaſing Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as hath alſo the Side-Front, toward the <hi>Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine River,</hi> which is different from the other Two.</p>
               <p>The Inſide of the Houſe is finiſhed in the higheſt Taſte, the Ceilings being richly gilt and painted; and the Rooms are filled with ſome of the beſt Pictures in <hi>Europe</hi>; and tho' the Houſe is ſmall, yet it would take up more Room than can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed here, to deſcribe the particular Beauties of it.</p>
               <p>The Gardens are alſo laid out in an elegant Taſte. When you deſcend from the Houſe, you enter on a Lawn of Graſs, planted with Clumps of ever-green Trees, between which are two Rows of large Stone Vaſes. At the Ends next the Houſe are two fine Wolves in Stone, cut by Mr. <hi>Sceidmaker</hi> the famous Statuary: and at the farther End are two large Lions; and to terminate this View are three
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0141100403:298"/>
fine antique Statues, which were dug up in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Garden at <hi>Rome,</hi> with Stone Seats between each; and on the Back of the Statues is a cloſe Plantation of Ever-greens, which terminates the Proſpect.</p>
               <p>On the Right-hand, as you go from the Houſe, you look thro' an open Grove of Foreſt-trees, to the Orangery; which is ſeparated from the Lawn by a Fauſſee, to ſecure the Orange-trees from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by Perſons who are admitted to walk in the Garden; ſo that they are ſeen as perfectly, and when the Orange-trees are in Flower, the Scent is diffuſed over the whole Lawn to the Houſe, as if the Trees were placed on the Lawn.</p>
               <p>On the Left-hand you have an eaſy Slope of Graſs down to the Serpentine River, on the Side of which are Clumps of Ever-greens, which make agreeable Breaks to the Eye, between which the Water is ſeen; and at the farther End is a Peep into an Incloſure, where are an Obeliſk and a <hi>Roman</hi> Temple, with Graſs Slopes, and a circular Piece of Water in the Middle.</p>
               <p>From this Lawn you are led to the Wilderneſs, through which are three ſtrait Avenues, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by three different Buildings; and within the Quarters are Serpentine Walks, thro' which you may walk near a Mile in conſtant Shade.</p>
               <p>On each Side the Serpentine River is a Graſs Walk, which follow the Turns of the River; and on the Right-hand of the River is a Building, which is the exact Model of the Portico of <hi>Covent Garden</hi> Church; and on the Left is a Wilderneſs, which is laid out in regular Walks, with clipp'd Hedges on each Side, which is too mean for the other Parts of the Garden; and it is much to be wondered his Lordſhip ſhould ſuffer them to remain in the preſent Form.</p>
               <p>Over the River, in the middle Part, is a <hi>Palladian</hi> Bridge of Wood, which his Lordſhip croſſes in his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0141100403:299"/>
Coach to come round to the Houſe; for there is a Coach Road thro' the Garden, by which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip paſſes when he comes from <hi>London,</hi> ſo that the Earl ſeldom goes thro' the Town of <hi>Chiſwick</hi> to his Houſe.</p>
               <p>At the End of the River, next the Road, is a fine Caſcade lately erected, which by an Engine to raiſe the Water, his Lordſhip propoſed to have a conſtant Fall into the River; but the Engine failing, it is but ſeldom the Caſcade can play, and then but for a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Next the Road his Lordſhip has raiſed a Terrace, (with the Earth which came out of the River) from whence you have a Proſpect of the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and when the Tide is up, you ſee the Water of the <hi>Thames,</hi> with the Boats and Barges paſſing, which greatly enlivens the Proſpect. In a Word, there is more Variety in this Garden, than can be found in any other of the ſame Size in <hi>England,</hi> or perhaps in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>IT is ſituated near <hi>Ealing,</hi> between the two great Weſtern Roads, and ſtands on an Eminence, the Ground falling gradually from it to the <hi>Brentford</hi> Road; ſo that from the Portico in the Back-front of the Houſe, you have an exceeding fine Proſpect of the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and all the Meadows on the Borders for ſome Miles, as alſo a good Proſpect of <hi>London,</hi> in clear Weather. This Houſe was built by Mr. <hi>Web,</hi> who was Son-in-law to the famous <hi>Inigo Jones</hi>; and indeed the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture ſhews it was contrived by him, or at leaſt by a Scholar of his; for altho' the Building is as plain on the Outſide as poſſible, yet there is a ſimple
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0141100403:300"/>
Boldneſs in it, which graces all the Buildings of <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> rarely to be found in the Works of other Architects. The Apartments in the Houſe are extremely convenient, and well contrived. The Hall is very large, having Rows of Columns on each Side. From thence you aſcend by a noble Flight of Stairs, to a Salon, which is a double Cube of Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five Feet. This Room the preſent Poſſeſſor <hi>Henry Furneſs,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is fitting up in a moſt elegant Taſte, and he is poſſeſſed of a fine Collection of capital Pictures: ſo he propoſes to hang this Room intirely with them; which, when finiſhed, will render it one of the fineſt Rooms in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Room is the Entrance to the Portico on the Back-front of the Houſe, which is ſupported by Columns, and is a delightful Place to ſit in, in the Afternoon, during the Summer Seaſon; for as it faces the South-eaſt, ſo the Sun is gone from it by two o' the Clock, and ſhining on the Country, which is open to the View, renders the Proſpect very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
                  <p>Upon going out of the Houſe into the Garden, you come upon a noble Terrace, the whole Width of the Garden, from whence you have a fine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the neighbouring Country, and on which you may walk dry after the greateſt Rains; from this Terrace you deſcend to the Garden by a noble Flight of Stone Steps, the upper Part of which is concave, and the lower convex, with a noble Stone Baluſtrade on each Side, as alſo upon the Coping of the Wall, the Length of the Houſe, which makes a fine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from the Road; but the Gardens are laid out too plain, having the Walls in View on every Side; and at preſent the Offices are too mean for the Houſe, which I hear the preſent Poſſeſſor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to alter, in a moſt elegant Taſte, which will render it the fineſt Seat near <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>AT <hi>Peckham</hi> is the Seat of the late Lord <hi>Trevor,</hi> which was built in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> II. by Sir <hi>Thomas Bond,</hi> who was deeply engaged with that unfortunate Prince in his Schemes, and was obliged to quit the Kingdom with him; ſo the Houſe was plundered by the Populace, and became a Forfeit to the Crown. In the Building and the Gardens, large Sums of Money were expended; for the Whole was executed according to the politeſt Taſte of thoſe Times. The Front of the Houſe ſtands to the North, having Two Rows of large Elm-trees of a conſiderable Length before it, thro' which the Tower of <hi>London</hi> appears as a Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Proſpect; but on each Side of this Avenue you have a View of <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> to <hi>Greenwich</hi>; and at high Water the Maſts of the Veſſels on the River of <hi>Thames</hi> appear over the Trees and Houſes like a Wood, which greatly improves the Proſpect. The Fields in Front, and on each Side of the Houſe, being well cultivated, render them very agreeable; and the Town of <hi>Peckham</hi> lies on the Backſide of the Gardens, but is ſhut out from the View by Plantations. The Wilderneſs indeed was planted too regular, having diagonal Walks interſecting each other, with Hedges on each Side; but this was the Taſte which prevailed, when thoſe Gardens were laid out. The Kitchen-garden and the Walls were planted with the choiceſt Fruit-trees from <hi>France,</hi> and an experienced Fruit-gardener was ſent for from <hi>Paris,</hi> to have the Management of them; ſo that the Collection of Fruits in this Garden has been accounted one of the beſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

to make very great Alterations, particularly in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down Hedges, removing Walls and Buildings, which intercepted the Proſpect of the neighbouring Fields; and had the Gentleman lived a few Years longer, he would have intirely altered it to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Taſte of Gardening, and rendred it a ſweet Retirement, conſidering its Vicinity to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>IN the Year 1740, on the Promotion of Dr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> Dean of this Church, to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Llandaff,</hi> his Majeſty was pleas'd to confer the Deanry on Dr. <hi>Alured Clarke,</hi> who was inſtalled in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> in that Year; and if we may be allowed to judge from the pious Acts he began with in that Station, a more worthy Man could not have been preferr'd thereto.</p>
               <p>The Houſe, an antient Building, belonging to that Dignity, had, thro' the Remiſſneſs of its former Poſſeſſors, been too long neglected; wherefore his Firſt Work was to ſet about altering and repairing that, which he did within Nine Months of his Inſtall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at an Expence of about 800<hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before this was perfected, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Spring 1741, he drew up and publiſhed Propoſals for founding an Hoſpital in this City, for Lodging, Dieting, and Curing the Sick and Lame Poor thereof, and of the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> on the like Plan of that which he had before founded at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> for the Benefit of that City, and County of <hi>Hants.</hi> A Deſign ſo good, recommended by the pious Eloquence of a Divine ſo learned and judicious, on Views ſo viſibly diſintereſted, and ſo clearly abſtracted from all Party Schemes or Intentions, met with the general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and Aſſiſtance of the Gentry and Clergy of all Parties, Sects and Denominations; who, however

               <p>AT <hi>Painſhill</hi> near <hi>Cobham</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> is the Seat of the Hon. <hi>Charles Hamilton,</hi> where is a great Improvement making by incloſing a large Tract of Land deſigned for a Park, which was moſt of it ſo poor as not to produce any thing but <hi>Heath</hi> and <hi>Broom</hi>; but by burning of the <hi>Heath,</hi> and ſpreading of the Aſhes on the Ground, a Crop of <hi>Turneps</hi> was obtained; and by feeding Sheep on the <hi>Turneps,</hi> their Dung become a good Manure to the Land, ſo that a good Sward of Graſs is now upon the Land, where it was judged by moſt People impoſſible to get any Herbage. This is the ſort of Improvement which was mentioned in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where Land has been raiſed from Five Shillings an Acre <hi>per Ann.</hi> to Thirty or Forty Shillings: and were this ſort of Huſbandry practiſed in many other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> it would be of great Service to the Publick, and greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Value of the Lands to the Proprietor.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to a Reflection on the preſent advanced Price of <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> (<hi>Anno</hi> 1742.) which many People attribute intirely to the Two laſt hard Winters, and the ſucceeding dry Summers; which muſt be allowed have greatly contributed towards it; yet theſe are not the only Cauſes of it; but there has of late Years been a great Neglect of the Dairy-farms, either from the Poverty of the Farmers, who could not keep up their Stock of Cows, or by ploughing too much of their Graſs-ground for raiſing of Corn. And many Landlords (it is to be feared) have permitted their Tenants to break up too much of their Land for Corn, becauſe of the great Demand there has been for it abroad of late Years; and this has enabled their Tenants to pay their Rent better than otherwiſe they could have done.</p>
               <p>But the Conſequence will be ſeverely felt for ſome Years; for as the Farmers Stock of Cattle has been reduced greatly by this Alteration in the Huſbandry,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0141100403:305"/>
ſo it will be impoſſible for them to get Manure enough to keep their Land in Heart; and when this freſh Ground is worn out by Crops, the yearly Value of it will be reduced to leſs than one Third of what it has produced: ſo that it is greatly to be feared moſt of the Eſtates in <hi>England</hi> will be leſſened in their Rent; and unleſs the Owners will be at ſome Expence to lay down properly a Proportion of their Lands for Graſs, they can hardly expect ever to ſee a proper Sward on their Eſtates; for the Farmers in general have not the leaſt Skill in this particular Branch of Huſbandry.</p>
               <p>But to return from this Digreſſion: The Lands which Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> has incloſed, have fine Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for every 100 Yards there are great Hollows, then riſing Grounds again, ſo that the Proſpect is continually changing, as you walk over it; and (if we may gueſs by what this Gentleman has already done) the Whole will be laid out conformable to the natural Situation of the Ground; and when the Plantations, which are already made, are grown up, it will be a delightful Place; and this upon a Spot of Ground, which lay almoſt neglected, before this Gentleman became poſſeſſed of it; ſo that whatever is here laid cut, will be intirely an Improvement, ſince without it the Land would have produced very little Rent to the Proprietor. And would the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who incloſe large Tracts of Land into Parks, follow this Gentleman's Method, of incloſing ſuch Land as is of little Value, and improve it, by making a good Sward upon it, their Eſtates would be greatly benefited by it.</p>
               <p>The Houſe which at preſent is on this Spot, is very ſmall, being what Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> found built on it by his Predeceſſor; to which he has only added one handſome Room on the Backſide, which is elegantly fitted up, and completely furniſhed with good Pictures: but as there are ſo many better Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0141100403:306"/>
for a Houſe in the middle of the Park, ſo it is ſuppoſed this Gentleman will erect a new Manſion-houſe, anſwerable to the Deſign of his Plantations.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Mole,</hi> which riſes near <hi>Darking,</hi> paſſes along by the Side of this Park, and in its Courſe ſerpents about in ſo pretty a manner, as that you frequently loſe the Sight of it; and by its Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings make the Courſe almoſt Four Miles within the Compaſs of this Incloſure. Indeed this River is very narrow, and in dry Weather the Current is exceeding ſlow, and the Water not well coloured, which, it muſt be allowed, takes off from its Beauty; yet there is room for great Improvements, by ſloping off the Banks, ſo as to have a better View of the Water; and in many Places by taking away ſome of the little Projection of the Banks, it may be widened ſo as to appear conſiderable at ſome Diſtance: which, if done, will add much to the Beauty of the Place.</p>
               <p>Near this Place is the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> which is built in a very ſingular Taſte, ſomething after the Model of an <hi>Italian Villa,</hi> but very plain on the Outſide. The Apartments within ſeem very commodious, and the principal Rooms are elegantly fitted up, the Ceilings being gilt, and all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are richly ornamented: the Offices below are very convenient, and judiciouſly contrived to anſwer the Purpoſes for which they were deſigned. But what chiefly ſtruck my Curioſity on ſeeing it, was a falſe Story contrived on each Side of the Houſe, taken from the Difference in the Height of the Side-rooms, from thoſe principal Apartments: and theſe are converted into long Galleries with a ſmall Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at one End, which affords a Communication between them. In the <hi>Attick</hi> Story there are very good Lodging-rooms, which are well laid together: ſo that for the Size of this Houſe, there is hardly any other near <hi>London,</hi> which has more uſeful and elegant Apartments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0141100403:307"/>The Situation of the Houſe is on an Eminence, ſo that it commands the Proſpect of the adjacent Fields, which are kept in very exact Order; and there is a Declivity from the Houſe to the River <hi>Mole,</hi> which paſſes along by the Side of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Garden: and here it appears much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than in any other Part of its Courſe; for Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> has taken away ſo much of the Earth of the Banks, as to make the River, in ſome Places, Four or Five times broader than it was naturally, ſo that it makes a handſome Appearance. And by the Side of the Water, he has diſpoſed the Earth into a natural Slope, with a broad Graſs-walk, planted with ſweet Shrubs on each Side; and at the End of the Walk is a fine Room, which has a View of the Water lengthwiſe, and is a ſweet Retreat in hot Weather, being ſhaded by large Elm-trees on the South-ſide, and having the Water on the North and Eaſt-ſides, which renders it very cool and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. This Houſe is ſituated about half a Mile from the publick Road to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and is ſo much hid by the Trees near it, as not to be ſeen until you riſe on the Common or Heath beyond <hi>Cobham,</hi> where in ſeveral Parts of the Road between that and <hi>Ripley,</hi> you have a fine View of it.</p>

               <p>FROM <hi>Blandford</hi> I took a Turn to view one of the largeſt and moſt ſtately new Fabricks in the Kingdom, I mean the Houſe, or rather Palace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Right Hon. <hi>George Dodington,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> It is ſituated in the Pariſh of <hi>Gunville,</hi> Four Miles from <hi>Blandford,</hi> and Six from <hi>Shafteſbury</hi> and <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</hi> The Houſe, Gardens and Park, containing in all about Eight Miles in Circumference, are now named <hi>Eaſtbury.</hi>

Pariſh. You approach it through one of the moſt beautiful Lawns which the Imagination can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and paſſing through the grand Court, on each Side of which the Offices are ranged in treble Rows, from four Baſs Courts, a moſt ſtately Portico pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf, ſupported by large and beautiful Pillars. Here you aſcend by many Steps between the Statues of Two Sphinxes; and having paſſed the Area of the Portico, you enter a moſt magnificent Hall, adorned with many Statues and Buſtoes, and its Roof painted in a moſt delicate Taſte.</p>
               <p>Hence you proceed to the Salon; one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Rooms in <hi>Europe,</hi> and which, with its fine Proportion, no leſs than the Splendor of its Gilding, cannot but ſtrike the moſt indifferent Beholder.</p>
               <p>At one End of this Salon is a princely Apartment, conſiſting of Three large Rooms furniſhed, one with Crimſon, another with flowered Velvet, and the third with Satin, all richly laced with Gold. At the other End of the Salon is a Drawing-room, and very large Dining-room, both magnificently gilt, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every Room in this Floor, except only the Hall.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Floor above Stairs is diſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grand Apartments: but as it is not our Intention, nor have we Room to deſcribe it minutely, we ſhall paſs to the Gardens, which are laid out with ſurpriſing Art: but what is moſt remarkable in them is the vaſt Collection of foreign Trees of various Kinds, the beautiful Verdure of the Walks, in the midſt of a Country whoſe Turf is of another Colour, eſpecially in Summer. This Houſe was begun by the late Mr. <hi>Dodington,</hi> and finiſhed by the preſent. The Architect was Sir <hi>John Vanbrugh.</hi>
