            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOSE who are converſant in the French Drama, will readily perceive that the <hi>Captive of Spilburg</hi> is little elſe than a tranſlation of <hi>Le Souter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain.</hi> In adapting it to the Engliſh ſtage, endeavours have been uſed to ſelect the moſt ſtriking and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting features of the Original. The principal Alteration conſiſts in the Airs, which, when new Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic is to be compoſed, it is ſeldom of any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to tranſlate.</p>
            <p>Much cenſure has of late been caſt on the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of thoſe who write <hi>words</hi> for Muſical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. —That ſome remiſsneſs ſhould creep in upon a laborious taſk, where the utmoſt diligence
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0049501800:6"/>can attain little praiſe, will be no ſubject of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to any one accouſtomed to habits of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: but that indulgence may fairly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to writers of this deſcription may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the apology made by the great Dryden for himſelf on this ſubject. In ſpeaking of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our language, in muſical compoſition, he ſays <q>it conſiſts too much of monoſyllables, and thoſe too moſt commonly clogg'd with conſonants, for which reaſon, (he adds) I am often forced to coin new words, revive ſome that are antiquated, and botch others, as if I had not ſerved out my time in Poetry, but was bound 'Prentice to ſome Doggrel Rhimer, who makes ſongs to tunes and ſings them for a livelihood. 'Tis true I have not been often put to this drudgery; but, <hi>where I have, the words ſufficiently ſhew, that I was then a ſlave to the compoſition,</hi> which I will never be again.</q> In fact the diligent writer of words to be adapted to Muſic goes to work with fewer materials than any other, with a vocabulary <hi>disfurniſhed</hi> of at leaſt one third of his language.
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0049501800:7"/>All cloſe ſounds, all words ending in mutes, all in which many conſonants are perceptible to the ear; are unfavourable to, and ſome times incompatible with his purpoſe. What embarraſsment this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction produces, and how greatly it impedes the efforts of a writer, <hi>Experiment</hi> will beſt aſcertain.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for this ſpecies of writing, it is likewiſe liable to cenſure from the errors of others as well as of the writer. The Muſic of every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Dramatic Production is immediately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and words are annexed to it, which, from the frequent inaccuracy (in that point) of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Plate Engraver, are <hi>very falſely ſaid to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> by the Author of the Piece. But this the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious obſerver will eaſily diſcriminate.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlator of the preſent Drama is as fully aware as the moſt ſplenetic critic can be, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of this kind are of no great importance to the retired reader. They are however the food of the Stage; and a really comprehenſive and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0049501800:8"/>mind will not eſtimate their merits merely by the ſcale of Literature, but will recollect that the Theatre demands action, that the beſt written plays <hi>may</hi> be the moſt unfit for repreſentation, and that without this conſideration the moſt accurate judge of books will be a very inadequate cenſor of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic writings.</p>
