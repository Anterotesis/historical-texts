            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>To genuine pity: who like him retired</l>

               <head>The DEATH-SONG OF RAGNAR LODBRACH, King of DENMARK.</head>
               <p>RAGNAR LODBRACH flouriſhed in the ninth century, and by his piratical expeditions (according to the cuſtom of his countrymen) rendered himſelf the terror of the northern parts of Europe. After having carried on his depredations with ſucceſs for many years, he was at length taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by Ella, King of Northumberland, whoſe coaſts He had invaded, and put to death by Him, being (as was reported) caſt into a dungeon full of ſerpents. His melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0653202200:144"/>
fate ſtimulated his Son Ivar to avenge it; and on this occaſion the famous ſtandard of the Raven is ſaid to have been embroidered by his Siſters, and conſecrated with ſuch magic rites as inſured victory to thoſe before whom it was borne. Under this ſtandard Ivar made a deſcent on the territories of Ella, fought with, vanquiſhed, and put Him to death in his turn.</p>
               <p>The following Poem, if we may credit tradition, was compoſed by Ragnar, in his horrid place of confinement. It is apparent however that it muſt have been the work of ſome Scald or Bard, probably to do honour to to the memory of his deceaſed King, to place before the eyes of his ſubjects his heroic atchievements, and urge them, and his Son (or Sons according to the Poem itſelf) to revenge.</p>
               <p>It is preſerved by Olaus Wormius in his book de Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raturâ Runicâ. While the frequent return of the ſame images and expreſſions ſhews the Author's unacquaintance with the nicer rules of compoſition, He exhibits a ſpecies of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0653202200:145"/>
ſavage greatneſs, a fierce and wild kind of ſublimity, and a noble contempt of danger and death. If for no other reaſon, this Epicedium is valuable, as it doubtleſs affords a lively picture of the manners and ſentiments of the northern nations.</p>

He met the ſerpent, whoſe teeth had no effect on this impenetrable mail, fixed him to the ground with his ſpear, and ripping him up with his ſword, tore out his heart. After the victory the King preſented him his daughter, and on account of his rough dreſs, gave him the name above mentioned, by which he was from that time diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>Olaus Magnus relates this adventure, but ſays He fought with and killed two ſnakes. That the King had taken them when young, and bred them up as a guard for his daughter; but as they increaſed in ſize, they became a public terror, and poiſoned the country.</p>
                        <p>Such is the fabulous beginning attributed by Bards and Hiſtorians to the actions of Ragnar Lodbrach. His ſubſequent adventures ſeem however better founded, and carry no marks of ſable, till we come to the laſt ſcene, when the manner of his death is as wonderful and incredible as his firſt appearance.</p>
