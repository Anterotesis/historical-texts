            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THERE was Room to apprehend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Repreſentation of the following Farce, that the Subject might appear extravagant and merely ideal; but the real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of it is diſplayed in ſuch a lively and pictureſque Manner by the Author of the Prologue, and was at once ſo univerſally felt by the Audience, that all neceſſity of ſaying any thing farther on this Head is now entirely ſuperſeded. What at preſent remains to be feared, is, that the <hi>Apprentice</hi> will not make ſo lively a figure in the cloſet, as on the Stage, where the Parts in general were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be well performed; where <hi>Simon</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented with a perfection of folly, where the Skill of Mr. <hi>Yates</hi> exhibited the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Mind, whoſe Ideas extend very little beyond the multiplication Table, and whoſe Paſſions are ever in a crazy Conflict, unleſs when they all ſubſide into a ſordid Love of Gain; and where Mr. <hi>Woodward's</hi> admirable comic Genius gave ſuch a Spirit to the whole, that there is Reaſon to think, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he relinquiſhes the Part, the <hi>Apprentice</hi> may again elope from his Friends, without any one's deſiring him to Return to his Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Author has however endeavoured to render all its Defects as excuſable as he could, and he wiſhes no ſtronger Criticiſm could be brought againſt him, than the two following Obſervations, which he thinks very ſingular and ſomewhat entertaining. <q>
                  <hi>I can't,</hi> ſays one, <hi>give my Opinion of the Piece, till I have</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0054801600:3"/>
Time to conſider the Depth of it</q>—<q>
                  <hi>Po!</hi> ſays another, <hi>this is not all his</hi> OWN, <hi>I remember some of it in other Plays.</hi>
               </q>—In order to aſſiſt the former in his deep Reſearches, and to enable the latter to make good his charge of Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, References are made to the ſeveral Plays, from which the diſtempered Hero of the piece makes up his motley, but characteriſtick Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. The intelligent Reader, if he think it worth his while to turn over theſe Leaves, will be pleaſed to remember that a Parody does not always carry with it a Burleſque on the Lines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to. For (as it is judiciouſly remarked in a note to Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Dunciad) <q>
                  <hi>It is a common, but fooliſh, miſtake that a ludicrous Parody of a grave and celebrated Paſſage; is a Ridicule of that Paſſage. A Ridicule indeed there is in every Parody, but where the Image is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from one Object to another, there the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule falls not on the Thing</hi> imitated, <hi>but</hi> imitating. <hi>Thus for Inſtance, when</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A Line of pope's in a ludicrous Account of the coronation in Henry the VIIIth.</note> 
                  <hi>Old Edward's Armour beams on Cibbers Breaſt.</hi> It is without Doubt an Object ridiculous enough; but then, I think, <hi>it falls neither on old King</hi> Edward, <hi>nor his</hi> Armour, <hi>but on his</hi> Armour-Bearer <hi>only.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this is prefacing a Farce as if it were a Thing of moment; I ſhall therefore diſmiſs it to the Preſs, without adding any Thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except my grateful Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception, with which the Public has honoured the trifling Scenes of</p>
