            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Perſon, who Publiſhes this ſhort Diſcourſe, and Directions, having Experienc'd, for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, in his own Practice, both as a <hi>Phyſician</hi> and <hi>Surgeon,</hi> the great, and indeed wonderful Effects of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Medicines, herein laid down and Preſcribed, for the Eaſe and Cure of the <hi>Gravel</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> thought it a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon him, to make the ſame known as much as poſſible, for the univerſal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Mankind; that thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily labour under the Severity of theſe cruel Diſeaſes, and have not heard of the Remedies, and may at any Time ſtand in need of the Aſſiſtance that will be afforded
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0384600100:3"/>by them, may have it in their Power, wherever they may chance to be, (ſo they have but the Book in their Pockets) of applying them, and that either prepar'd by themſelves, or having them prepar'd by an Apothecary.</p>
            <p>The whole of what is here Written, is, with ſome variations, and ſmall additions, taken from the Works of no leſs a Man, than the late Worthy Sir <hi>Richard Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Knt. Doctor of Phyſick, and Fellow of the Royal College of Phyſicians, in <hi>London,</hi> and in his Time, Phyſician in Ordinary to his late Majeſty King <hi>William,</hi> by ſaying of which, it is enough without any Encomium of mine, or any ones elſe, as to his Learning, conſummate Knowledge, and long Experience, in the Cure of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in general, as well as of theſe in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Fame therein, as well as his Integrity, Humanity, and compaſſionate Regar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to his afflicted and diſtreſſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, being ſufficiently known in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0384600100:4"/>
            <p>All therefore that I ſhall ſay, is, that every Patient, under the Torture of theſe mercileſs Diſeaſes, will not fail (I ſpeak by repeated Experience) to find Relief and a Cure, if they but make timely and diſtinct Application of the Remedies, and live up to the eaſy Rules and Directions, ſo plainly and faithfully, without any reſerve, herein laid down and explain'd: And as they are Medicines, not preſcrib'd at random, or at a venture, but upon the judicious and ſedate Conſideration of the Author, in a regular Way, grounded upon Reaſon and low Experience, and which the Doctor had ever found Succeſsful, when he had been call'd to the Relief of Patients in theſe deplorable Diſtreſſes, they are the more to be regarded, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſo, as they in every Circumſtance, have correſponded with the Opinions of the beſt of Phyſicians, and by conſequence muſt ſtand approv'd, by the whole Faculty of Phyſick.</p>
            <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0384600100:5"/>
            <p>And tho' the Doctor ſeems to explode the poſſibility of Diſſolving the <hi>Stone,</hi> yet he has confin'd his Opinion to thoſe only of them, that are hard and compact, thoſe of them that are porus, light, and friable, he admits may he diſſolved, or at leaſtwiſe crumbled, or divided into ſmall Fragments or Parts, ſo as to be rendred paſſable, and has herein alſo Preſcrib'd ſuch Remedies, which he has long experienc'd to have done it.</p>
            <p>Phyſicians, I well know, very much differ as to the poſſibility of Diſſolving the <hi>Stone,</hi> many of them affirming it has been done, without any diſtinction of hard or ſoft, and may be daily done, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Caſes of many Patient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cured thereby; nor are there wanting as many, who as flatly deny the poſſibility thereof: For the firſt, I have now before me, the Works of ſeveral Authors of good Credit, and the Caſes of divers Patients, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Aſſertions; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0384600100:6"/>one of the ſaid Authors, lately fam'd therein, ſays, that tho' the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the <hi>Stone,</hi> by Medicines, has been for a long Time exploded as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, yet I muſt confeſs, ſays he, I never could come into that Notion: I always was of Opinion, ſays he, that no Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was Incurable, and that only our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Cauſes, made ſome more difficult to handle than others: But that if we could ſee into the original Spring of the moſt obſtinate and ſtubborn Maladies, we ſhould find them as tractable, and eaſy to Cure, as thoſe that lie more obvious to our view: And I perſwade myſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he, that if the Poſitions I have, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, in defence of a Diſſolution of the <hi>Stone,</hi> be brought to the Teſt of Reaſon, the Arguments will be unanſwerable, and that tho' ſome may object againſt the moſt evident Matters of Fact, yet no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſtrong againſt Demonſtration.</p>
            <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0384600100:7"/>
            <p>And in confidence of theſe his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proofs of his Aſſertions, he names ſeveral Caſes, where there has been a manifeſt Diſſolution, by ſeveral Preſcriptions he gives, and one of them in particular, which he ſays, he has more than ordinary experienc'd ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and recommends it as a moſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>Lithontriptick,</hi> and believes, that a more powerful <hi>Diſſolvent,</hi> is not yet known to Mortals.</p>
            <p>But of theſe I ſhall ſay more in a <hi>Second</hi> Part, which I purpoſe in no long Time, <hi>GOD</hi> willing, to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, according as I have noted, at the End of this <hi>Firſt</hi> Part.</p>

               <p>THE Diſeaſe of the Stone, either in the Kidneys or the Bladder, and that of the Gout, which are nearly related, are two of the moſt cruel and inexorable Tyrants that perſecute the Race of Mankind: So great is their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo unextinguiſhed their Fury, that they afflict the unhappy Patients with ſuch frequent and inſufferable Tortures, as make Life an undeſirable Poſſeſſion, and rather a Burthen too hard to bear, than a State of Satisfaction and Enjoyment. And had not the All-wiſe Divine Author, planted in our Nature, ſo ſtrong an Averſion to Death and Diſſolution, it is highly probable that many, grown utterly impatient of undergoing ſuch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0384600100:9"/>a Weight of Miſery, would lay Hands upon themſelves, and ſoon put an End to their Calamities and their Lives together, the Grievance or the firſt to much over-balancing the Pleaſure of the laſt.

               <p>But it muſt be allowed, that of this Pair ſo near y allied, the Stone and the Gout, the firſt is the moſt terrible, and diſtinguiſhed for its Fierceneſs and Cruelty. This Lictor and Miniſter of Death, inflicts, above all others, the ſharpeſt and moſt inſufferable Tortures: What a melancholy Scene! What a moving Spectacle of mortal Nature is it, to ſee the unhappy Patient extended on the Rack, groaning and crying out in Agonies of Diſtreſs and unſpeakable Torment: E'er Night is half ſpent, he wiſhes for Day; when Day appears, he longs for Night; Diſtracted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0384600100:10"/>with his Sufferings, he lies wakeful, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hours, any one of which, when protracted and multiplied by raging Miſery, ſeems a numerous Train, ſo ſluggiſh and unprogreſſive does Time grow under griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sufferings. He changes his Pillow, but not his Pain; new-makes his Bed, but keeps his old Inquietudes, and though he often turns from Side to Side, he never leaves his Agonies behind: They, hapleſs State! know no Ceſſation or Interruption: If they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remit and abate their Violence, they ſoon recover their Strength, rekindle their Rage, and inſult the Patient with as great Fury as before. It muſt therefore be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Action, and becoming an <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapian</hi> worthy to endeavour, with all his Might, to repel or diſable this Plague that ſo much infeſts Mankind; and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I have undertaken to aſſiſt thoſe who have already attacked this Peſt with Skill and Vigour: For this is not the Work of a ſingle Aggreſſor, but as in hunting down a Foreſt Beaſt, or that enormous Bird the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> many Champions unite their Power, armed with various Inſtruments of Death, Cutlaſſes, Lances, Hooks, and Javelins, that with different Weapons and mutual Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they may ſubdue the Enemy, or at leaſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0384600100:11"/>oblige him to retreat; ſo, as a ready Auxiliary, I bring my Forces, ſuch as they are, to join thoſe of abler Combatants, in order to quell this formidable Enemy, at leaſt to diminiſh his Strength and reſtrain his Fury.</p>
               <p>As to the Nature of the Diſeaſe, there are ſcarce any Part of the Body privileged from breeding Stones in their larger Cavities, or more minute Interſtices, which are, in ſome meaſure diverſified, according to the Nature of the Bowels or Organs where they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. They are found ſometimes in the external Muſcles of the Body, as well as in the Lungs, the Stomach, the Liver, the Gall- Bladder, the Bowels or Contents of the Abdomen, as well as in the Tongue, the Brain, and even the Blood it ſelf: For ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral credible Authors have affirm'd, that upon opening a Vein, ſmall Stones, together with the ſpouting Blood have ruſh'd into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. In all which Neſt, the petrifying Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, meeting and embracing each other, produce a ſingle Stone, or a Quarry of them But this Diſcourſe is confin'd to the Stone in the Kidneys, and that in the Bladder, which in this Diſſertation I ſhall conſider as the ſame, and not as the Diſeaſe of a diſtinct Species When it is formed and ſettled in either Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is accompanied with various Symptoms
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0384600100:12"/>according as it is large or ſmall, ſmooth or rugged, fixed or looſe, cloſely or ſlightly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, <hi>i. e.</hi> hard and ſolid, or friable and porous.</p>
               <p>Of the minute Stone, that is, the Grit and Gravel, formed of ſandy Rudiments in the Kidneys or Bladder, which however are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Stones, there are three Sorts diſtinguiſhed by their Colour, that is, White, Yellow, and Red. White is the native Complexion of theſe little Bodies, Atoms indeed, in reſpect of thoſe of the largeſt Dimenſion, as are the Sands on the Shore, when compared with the Rock at whoſe Feet they lie: Theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Stones are, however, ſo cloſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous, that the Coheſion of their Parts, are not to be unclaſped and diſſolved, but with great Difficulty, inſomuch that they imitate the Hardneſs of the Diamond, and will po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Glaſs, like the Duſt of that Jewel, as celebrated Authors aſſert; and it facilitates our Belief of the indiſſoluble Structure of this Grit, when we reflect on the like Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in that called Hour-Glaſs Sand, which is found, by Experience, to be leſs porous, or more ſolid than Flint; and therefore the Operators in Glaſs have laid aſide the firſt, and now employ the laſt, as Materials for their fineſt Works. But theſe minute white

               <p>As to the Yellow Gravel, it is evident that the minute Particles that compoſe it, are ſtained with that Colour, by the alkalizate or lixivial Salts of the Urine, which abounds with ſuch Contents: And this Mixture in the ſmall Yellow Stones, is the Reaſon why they are leſs ſolid, and more diſſoluble than the White of a purer Compoſition; which is likewiſe obſerv'd, and from the ſame Reaſon,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0384600100:14"/>in the Stones generated in the Receptacle of the Gall, whoſe Parts have not that ſtrict Connexion and cloſe Structure as the White.</p>
               <p>The Red Gravel receives that Complexion, from being infected with a little Drop of Blood iſſuing from ſome lacerated Vein where the Gravel lay.</p>
               <p>All theſe, if they are ragged and uneven, may, by pricking, vellicating, or wounding the tender Membranes that include them, cauſe either duller and heavier, or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Pains, according as they are arm'd with more or leſs pointed Angles whilſt they lie in the <hi>Pelvis</hi> or Baſin of the Kidneys, and there rouſed and diſturbed by the Motion of the Body on Foot or Horſeback, rub up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fret the neighbouring Membranes; and ſo nephritick Sufferings may ariſe from Gravel, which conſiſts in real and perfect Stones, as before obſerved, though called Sand, or a friable, gritty Matter, by Reaſon of their ſmall Dimenſion. This is the firſt nephritick Symptom before a larger Stone is formed, which, however, is vexatious, and often attended not only with Pain, but much Inquietude, Sickneſs of the Stomach, and a general Diſorder of the whole Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, while the ſandy Atoms, that lie heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the Kidneys, are worked and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0384600100:15"/>by the Motion of the Back or Loins, irritate and gaul their Membranes of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Senſe during their Confinement in thoſe Lodgings.</p>
               <p>It ought to be obſerved, that there are often ſound in the Urine of Perſons in good Health, or at leaſt not much diſtempered, a Red Gravel or Sand, that ſticks to the Sides of the Urinal or Chamber-pot that receives it; but this is not the genuine Gravel, that cauſes nephritick Sufferings, but the Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood in Perſons of a ſcorbutick Diſpoſition, or a warm Temperament, and is diſtinguiſhed from the true Gravel in this, that the laſt falls down, immediately after the Urine is rendered, to the Bottom of the Receiver, whereas the ſpurious Kind does not break off from its Mixture and Union with the Urine, till after ſome Hours ſtanding in that Veſſel, when it is at length looſed from its Embraces, precipitated and thruſt down by the Cold of the Air, and afterwards, if the Urine be gradually heated again, it will recover its former Connexion with it, which is not the Caſe of the genuine nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Gravel: Beſides, there is often obſerved in Perſons of ſuch a Conſtitution, a thin Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance floating on the Surface of their Urine, imitating melted Fat or Greaſe, but when it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0384600100:16"/>is skimmed off, and dried upon a Paper placed in the Sun, it diſcovers it ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of gritty ſaline Concretions, united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by ſome viſcous or ſlimy Bonds.</p>
               <p>If the Stones are of a larger Size than thoſe called Sand or Gravel, they affect Humane Bodies with yet more painful and afflictive Symptoms, and ſuppoſing that their Figure is unequal, and varied with many Angles; then their Points, eſpecially upon bodily Motion, vex and vellicate the Repoſitories where they are neſted, and as ſo many ſharp Thorns in the Sides of the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> continually grieve, prick, or wound their Membranes; whence ariſes the frequent Diſcharge of bloody Urine, a common Symptom of this cruel Diſeaſe, which, if freſh, and newly let out of the Veins, gives the Urine a red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the Blood is diſcernable to the Sight; but if it has lain, for ſome Time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſate in the Bladder, or if but a few Drops ſtay in that manner in the Kidneys, by turning to grumous and coagulated Clots, they impart a dark and blackiſh Tincture to the Urine, not unlike to that of Coffee; this is a Symptom likewiſe that often accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies this Diſtemper: It is true alſo, that pale limpid Water ſometimes attends the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms of the Stone, like that obſerved in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0384600100:17"/>Convulſive, Hypocondriacal, and Hyſterick Paſſions, and from the ſame Cauſe, that is, the Spaſmodick Diſorder or Contraction of the Syſtem of the Nerves during the Fit.</p>
               <p>Another Symptom, that accompanies the Stones laſt deſcribed, is great Sickneſs of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>omach, Nauſea, and frequent Vomitings, or Strainings to Vomit; for while the Fibres in the Kidneys are grieved, and lacerated by the rough Stone or Stones bred and confined there, the Suffering is propagated to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach by a Conſent of Parts, or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Nerves, from one of thoſe Bowels to the other; and this is ſo diſtinguiſhing a Symptom of this Diſeaſe in the Kidneys, that other Symptoms without this, are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to induce the Phyſician to pronounce the Diſtemper the Stone.</p>
               <p>If the Stone in the Kidneys be ſome Degree larger, and likewiſe jagged, it creates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Pains, while it remains in the <hi>Pelvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the Stone formed in the Kidneys is grown yet larger, and ſo diſproportioned to the Mouth of the Ureter, that it cannot enter, even though its Superficies is ſmooth and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0384600100:18"/>equal, it will obſtruct the Orifice of that Tube, while it attempts to paſs into it, or will ſtick in the Channel of it; and while it continues fixed there, as it ſtops the Current of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through the Pipe, ſo it creates exqusite and enormous Miſery, by diſtending the ſenſible Membranes; and if it be unequal and ragged, it will produce the moſt afflictive Tortures, till it is protrude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by Art or Nature through the Ureter, and excluded into the Bladder. This happens as often as the Stone grows to a greater Size than is ſuitable to the Inlet and Paſſage of that Tube: And the Effect is the ſame if the Stone, though not of a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate Bulk to paſs the Ureter, ſhould how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lye a-croſs the Orifice, for then it will obſtruct the Deſcent of the Urine, and create great Diſorder, till it find a proper Poſition, and its Figure is adapted to the Inlet, and then it enters and is at laſt diſcharged.</p>
               <p>After the Stone has made its Paſſage through the Ureters for ſome Years, by ſtretching and enlarging the Road ſo often, it becomes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious enough to receive much larger Stones than the firſt, and to let them through into the Bladder; ſo that the Cavity of the Ureter, through which they have paſſed ſo long, is by Degrees ſometimes extended to a Finger's Breadth, as unqueſtionable Authors aſſure us.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0384600100:19"/>The Stone of the Kidneys is likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as looſe or fixed; if as looſe and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not adherent to any part of that Bowel, but is always attempting to paſs the Ureters to the Bladder, it produces the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Symptoms before deſcribed; but if it is fixed, it then Neſts itſelf and ſettles in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Kidneys, where it grows by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Parts, and ſpreads <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this was the Caſe, as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the late Lord <hi>Mohun</hi>'s Father, who being open'd after he dyed of a Wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a Duel, a large Stone was diſcovered ſpreading through the Kidney, of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in his Life Time he was entirely unconſcious. I likewiſe knew an eminent Divine, of a very Lean and Unmuſcular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, who told me in Converſation, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0384600100:20"/>ſuſpecting he had a Stone in the Kidneys, tryed one Night in Bed, if he could not feel it, and by preſſing his Loins, much emaciated with his long Fingers, he aſſured me he felt the Stone, and then, ſaid h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, I reflected it muſt be a large one propagated through that Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and therefore that no Medicinal Methods ſhould be attempted to break it, leſt the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments falling into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> ſhould ſtop the Paſſage of the Ureters, and create great Fits of the Stone; upon this, ſaid he, I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll aſleep, and during many Years, thought of it no more, till of late ſome Incident, which he named, and I have forgotten, brought again to his Mind this Obſervation, and when he (ſome Years afterwards) Died and was Diſſected, a large Stone was found in his Kidney, which though he felt, as ſaid before, yet lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed and quiet in its Neſt, it gave him little Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Stone we are diſcourſing of is either lighter or heavier, or which is the ſame thing, more porus and friable, or more cloſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. The Particles that compoſe the firſt, hang together by a ſlight Connexion, which is eaſily broken and diſſolved, like Flocks of frozen Snow, the Sides of a Spunge, or the unſolid and porus Subſtance of the Pumice-Stone, and theſe by any internal or external Violence,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0384600100:21"/>or milder Motion, are often ſeparated and crumbled into Parts, that drop into the Ureters and paſs into the Bladder, to be diſcharged, and theſe Fragments, like the ſmall ſandy and gritty Stones ſpoken of before, produce the ſame troubleſome Effects.</p>
               <p>I have accounted for the Stones, that owe their Production to the Kidneys, and ſhall now purſue their Progreſs and follow their Courſe to the Bladder. When the Stone generated in the Urinary Strainer is diſcharged by the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the common Receiver, it too often happens, that it acquires ſo large a Dimenſion, that the Outlet of the Bladder is not wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to let it through, and therefore of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt remain impriſoned there, where by the Acceſſion of new petrifying Particles, and gritty Matter continually deſcending from the Kidneys, and adhering to it, its Size is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually augmented, till it is yet more incapable of being excluded, where if it is looſe and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it produces many grievous Symptoms; for though it be only ſmooth and equal, and ſo does not lacerate the Bladder, yet it will often, as it plays againſt the Neck of it, and attempts to paſs through, ſtop the Mouth of the Aquaeduct, that conveys away the Urine, and by ſo doing, produces very great Torment, while the Bladder is exceſſively diſtended, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0384600100:22"/>unable to diſcharge the encloſed Deluge; and if the Stone be uneven and rugged, it will by goading and wounding the encompaſſing Membranes, create exquiſite Pain and bloody Urine, and by long repeated Cruelties of this Kind, it frequently forms an Ulcer in the lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Part, which is diſcovered by the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of putrid Matter mingled with the Urine; for when it has ſtood ſome Hours, a pale ſlimy Sediment is precipitated to the Bottom of the Receiver, like the Excrement of the Noſe, or the Whites of Eggs, and is diſtinguiſhed, from the like Matter that deſcends to the Bladder, from an Ulcer in the Kidneys, by the Odour, which is ſtrong and faetid, if the purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er comes from an Ulcer in the Bladder, but that derived from one in the Kidneys has no ſuch offenſive Smell, as ſaid above. And the Caſe is the ſame when an Ulcer ariſes in the Kidneys or the Neck of the Bladder, not from the Stone but from other Cauſes, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Ulcers in the Lungs, in the Inteſtines, or other internal Parts, that is, the Impurities and incongruous Particles, which by Reaſon of their diſproportionate Size and Figure, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſlide through the ſtrait Paſſages of the Glands, but ſtick in them, till more of the like Nature entangled there, encreaſe the Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſwell the Parts, whence by Degrees
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0384600100:23"/>they are inflamed, putrify, and by their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, form an Ulcer; and when this Diſeaſe is produced in the Kidneys or the Bladder, the putrid Contents iſſuing from them, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Urine excluded into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, ſhew themſelves, as I have ſaid, by their viſcous and ropy Quality, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified by their faetid or inoffenſive Smell: And it ſhould be obſerved, that their mucous and ſlimy Nature, diſtinguiſhes theſe Contents from others, that proceed from a ſcorbutick or unhealthful Habit of Body, when much white, mealy, and light Matter appears in the Sediment, and which being without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, upon ſhaking the Glaſs will riſe and float incoherent in the Urine, but unſlimy, as well as without Faetor: This therefore, as I have ſaid, does not proceed from any internal Ulcer, but is a Defect ariſing from ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and depraved State of the Blood, that communicates with its Serum ſuch Matter to the Kidneys.</p>
               <p>The Suppreſſion of Urine, occaſioned by a Stone too large to paſs the <hi>Urethra,</hi> is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Sickneſs and Vomiting, as when a Stone ſticks in its Paſſage through the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there being no Communication of Nerves between the Bladder and the Stomach, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Senſations from one to the other. But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0384600100:24"/>exquiſite and grievous Pains however attend it from the Diſtention of the Bladder, as I have ſaid, and ſometimes a ſmaller Stone, that has entered the Mouth of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> yet being too great to ſlide through, ſtops near the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, or in the Middle, and creates a total Suppreſſion of Urine, as well as great Torment.</p>
               <p>I have now accounted for the Nature, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and Symptoms of this Diſeaſe, and have likewiſe in carrying on my Diſcourſe, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed an Ennumeration of its various Kinds, diſcriminated by the Receptacles, where the Stone is contained, or by its different Colour or various Shape and Figure; and now I ſhall proceed to ſearch into the Cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>The remote, antecedent Cauſe of the Stone, is a defect in the digeſtive Faculty of the Stomach, or that of the Blood, or nervous Juices, whence ſuch Impurities and feculent Portions remain, as produce the Coagulations and Concreſcencies, that become the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stone, whoſe Rudiments and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Materials, conſiſt in a cloſe Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a volatile in a ſuperior, and acid Salt in an inferiour Proportion. That theſe two are the petrifying Principles, is known by Experience, that ſhews us that this is the Effect of Acids and Alkalies meeting together; as for Example, <hi>Juice of Lemon, and Salt of Tartar;</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0384600100:25"/>Let it be ſuppoſed then, that from the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and depraved Concoctions before-named, ſuch hard Coalitions, ſlimy Coagulations, or cretaceous Confederacies ſhould be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and it is eaſy to conceive how, when yet more hardened and prepared in the Blood, they may by the Power of the urinous Salts in the Kidneys, be ſoon converted into gritty, ſandy Atoms, which, cluſtring together, and cohering, form at length a Stone of the loweſt Size; that by the daily Acceſſion of new ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Particles, acquires a far greater Dimenſion in the Kidneys, and yet a greater after its Deſcent from that Bowel to the Bladder; for while it is detained, from being too large to be excluded, it has more Room to receive Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, whilſt conſtantly fed by the ſandy Rivulets, that empty themſelves through the Outlets of the Ureters into that Ciſtern, where it grows by ſuch Accretion, till ſometimes it becomes exceeding large: Thus petrified Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils and Flints in the Earth, as well as rotten, Sticks and Pieces of Wood turned to Stone, owe their Growth, as well as Production, to lapideſcent or ſtony Particles, that continually accede to, and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

It is truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that thoſe who are obnoxious to the Stone, are generally of a hot Conſtitution, as it is likewiſe obſerved of gouty Patients, by which means their Blood is more inclined to breed cretaceous, hard, and gritty Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which by a certain Degree of Heat, are ſoon advanced into proper Materials for the Gout and Stone, Diſeaſes ſo nearly related, that they are eaſily convertible into each other. But of theſe Subjects I have diſcourſed at large in my Treatiſe of the Gout, to which I refer the Reader.</p>

               <p>The voluptuous Life of thoſe that eat and drink deliciouſly every Day, cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to the Blood, the Seeds and Principles of the Stone, in Conſtitutions diſpoſed and prepared for that Diſtemper: For theſe coſtly and luxurious Meats and Drinks, exceſſively and conſtantly ingeſted, being unequal to the digeſt ve Power of the Stomach, fill it with a Load of Crudities and unconcocted Foods; which tranſmitted by the Miniſtry of the lacteal Paſſages to the Veins, communicate to the Blood, not only great Plenty of noxious Impurities, but likewiſe a rich Chyle, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in volatile Salts, with ſuch a Proportion of Acids, as are apt to create this Diſtemper.</p>

               <p>A ſedentary and inactive Life, eſpecially when the Perſons are of a vigorous and hot Complexion, much promotes the Production of the Stone; for while the Blood runs lazy and unagitated in its Channels, for want of due Labour and Exerciſe of the Limbs to puſh on its Streams with due Celerity, it is eaſy to conceive how the crude and impure Parts run into various Concreſcencies and Coagulations. On the contrary, when due Activity, either by the Labour of the Hands, or by riding, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Exerciſes of the Body, the Motion of the Blood is accelerated, it is obvious to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that by the Rencounters and mutual Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſions of the Parts daſhing and rubbing upon each other, they are broken, divided and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, till they become ſo minute and ſo well mixed, that the tough, ſlimy, and yet harder Combinations are unlocked and diſſolved, by which means the Seeds and Rudiments of the Stone are prevented, and the Cauſe removed: And therefore in this Caſe, as in the Gout, the ſedentary Lawyer; the over-thoughtful Perſon; the hard Student; and the inactive, indolent, and voluptuous Gentleman, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this grievous Diſtemper, as are likewiſe Men of covetous Tempers; while the laborious Husbandman, and Mechanick, the daily Traveller, and indefatigable Sportſman,

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0384600100:30"/>Urine: And it is highly neceſſary to attempt this, leſt otherwiſe the ſmall Stones, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undiſturbed, ſhould unite and adhere to each other, and receiving gradual Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from new Particles daily arriving, ſhould grow to a Stone of great Bulk, and become incapable of paſſing the Ureters, or at leaſt without great Difficulty and Pain; and when they ſlide through and drop into the Bladder, ſhould contract there a large Size as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. For it is highly probable, that the Stone is very ſeldom originally generated in that Receptacle, and that all, or at leaſt the far greateſt Part found there, deſcend thither from the Kidneys, and receive their Encreaſe from the ſandy and gritty Supplies, tranſmitted to it through the Ureters. It has therefore been an unhappy Neglect, committed by ſome Patients, that though they have long perceived a conſiderable Quatity of Gravel diſcharged with their Urine, and have felt the Trouble and Uneaſineſs of it in their Kidneys, have however, taken little Care to clear them of theſe gritty Materials, and prevent the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of more; from which Omiſſion, at length, Stones of a bigger Bulk, always painful and often fatal, have been produced.</p>
               <p>It is therefore evidently the Intereſt of all Perſons, when they obſerve that a Quantity of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0384600100:31"/>ſuch Sand and Gravel, the Rudiments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bigger Stones, is excluded with the Urine from the Bladder, to endeavour, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means, to free the Kidneys from theſe noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inhabitants, and prevent the Generation of new Supplies; and in the firſt Place, it is requiſite to convey away the Gravel, that is already bred, for which Purpoſe the following Method is moſt efficacious.</p>
               <p>Firſt Purgatives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take over Night, going to Bed, of Elixir Salutis, three Spoonfuls; and the next Morning, drink a Quart or three Pints of purging Mineral Waters, ſuch as thoſe of</hi> Epſom, Dulledge, Acton, Northal, <hi>&amp;c. And at Night going to Bed,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Milk-Water, two Ounces; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Water of Horſe-radiſh, half an Ounce; twelve Drops of liquid Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, and three Drachms of Diacodium; make it a Draught: repeat both Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines every other Day and Night, for three Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After an Interval of three Weeks do the ſame, and ſooner, if the Symptoms of the Gravel call for it.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0384600100:32"/>
               <p>Or, <hi>Drink alone, two Quarts of ſuch purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters ſeveral Days, and then reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon why theſe Waters are very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial for the Purpoſe intended, is, that a conſiderable Part of them paſs by Urine, and in their Paſſage through the Kidneys, waſh away in their Current the Sand and Gravel, and ſuffer them not to lodge there, till they grow to a Stone of a large Size: And 'tis the ſame in reſpect of the Bladder; for the ſame Flood that ruſhes down through the Ureters, carries off the Gritt from the Receiver, and expels it with the Urine.</p>
               <p>Diureticks, to be employed in the Intervals of purging, for the ſame Purpoſe, are ſuch as follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Roots of Chervil, Stone Parſley, Eringo, Fennel, Sorrel, each half an Ounce; of Seeds of Burdock, Aniſe, and ſweet Fennel, each a Drachm; of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Berries, three Drachms; boil theſe Ingredients, in three Pints of Spring-Water, to a Quart; add to it, a Drachm of purified Nitre; ſtrain it, and add a Pint of Rheniſh Wine: Drink a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Pint Morning and Evening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, <hi>Take Millepedes alive and waſhed, fifty, bruiſe them in a Mortar, with a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0384600100:33"/>Quarter of a Pint of Rheniſh Wine, and four Ounces of compound Horſe-radiſh Water; make a ſtrong Expreſſion for a Draught, to be taken twice a Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the moſt effectual Diuretick for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Gravel, and clearing the Parts afflicted with it, are mineral unpurging Waters, ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>Bath, Tunbridge,</hi> the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and other Chalybeate Springs: For theſe, ruſhing with a plentiful Tide through the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Organs where the Gravel is lodged as well as generated, diſturbs its ſeveral Neſts, and rolls along in its Stream, the Sand-beds it meets in its Way, till at length they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the Urine. But this is not the only Advantage, that attends the drinking co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly Chalybeate Waters; for beſides this, it very much contributes the laying the Axe to the Root of the Diſeaſe, and preventing the Generation of ſuch petrifying Seeds, as ſhall be ſhewn afterwards. There are other diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Remedies uſeful in this Diſtemper; as a Mixture of Water, <hi>French</hi> Brandy, and Juice of Lemon, called Punch, if made ſmall, and not intoxicating, though taken in a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Quantity. <hi>Juice or Syrup of Lemons; Syrup of Marſh-mallows; and freſh Oil of Sweet Almonds;</hi> of each an equal Portion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0384600100:34"/>mixed and beat together, with as much Sugar as is ſufficient to give them a Conſiſtency, taken to a Spoonful or two often in a Day, is very beneficial; ſo is a Spoonful or two of <hi>compound Juniper-Water of</hi> Cologne, <hi>or</hi> Holland, <hi>drank now and then in a Glaſs of White-wine;</hi> add to theſe Remedies, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Body, by riding ſometimes on a hard trotting Horſe, ſometimes by hurrying in a Coach over paved Stones, or other rugged and uneven Ground, (if the Patient can bear it) which by the repeated working and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the Back, move and diſlodge the Gravel in the Kidneys, and force it thence into the Bladder, whence it is excluded with the Water.</p>
               <p>Now to prevent the Production of little Stones or Gravel, all thoſe Remedies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as moſt effectual, that have an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vertue, to looſe and diſengage all viſcous and tough Coagulations, and diſſolve the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion and Structure of cretaceous and gritty Coalitions, whence ſmall Stones and Gravel are created, ſome in the Blood, and others in the urinary Strainers. This is indeed a Matter of the greateſt Importance in this Caſe; for if this is effected, the formidable and pernicious Diſeaſe will be cruſhed in Embrio, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to arrive at a mature State. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0384600100:35"/>ſet down the Medicines, endowed with the greateſt Force, for procuring this End.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to ſee that thoſe Remedies, that reſtore the Blood when depraved, to its native Temperament, and keep it in that juſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary Conſtitution, which ſpecifially belongs to this Animal Fluid, are in general to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; and in this Caſe in particular, thoſe are to be inſiſted on, that are moſt capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning and ſeparating the aſſociated, viſcous, and ſandy Particles, that conſpire to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a Stone, and ſo to attenuate and refine them, that they may eaſily incorporate with the Blood, and produce an uniform and equal Mixture.</p>
               <p>And for this Purpoſe, Chalybe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te Medicines, prepared by Art or Nature, are the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable: And ſince Patients afflicted with this Diſeaſe, are commonly of a hotter Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than others, thoſe Preparations that have the leaſt Sulphur left in their Compoſition, are moſt beneficial to them; ſuch as the <hi>Salt of Steel,</hi> or the Tincture of it in Wine: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, mineral Waters, impregnated with Steel in Embrio, are in this Caſe moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, which not only dilute and attemper the Blood, and carry off in their Current the ſandy and petrifying Materials, as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, but likewiſe by their active Vertue,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0384600100:36"/>animate, ferment, and exalt the Blood, break the Coheſion of the knotty and cretaceous Seeds of the Stone, and by wreſting the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from each others Embraces, prevent the engendering of this Diſeaſe, by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of ſuch Impurities. So that theſe ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Springs, are not only highly uſeful in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Veins from immiſcible and hurtful Matter, cleanſing the Urinary Channels, and rolling away in their Flood, the Gravel lodged in the Cavities, through which their Waters make their Way, but they likewiſe very much contribute to the Recovery of a juſt Craſis, or Conſtitution of Blood, by deſtroying the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Rudiments of this Diſeaſe, 'ere yet they combine in a Stone of large Size, and reach a mature State, which they effect in the Manner deſcribed.</p>
               <p>But if hard and gravelly Materials, aſſociate and unite in the Kidneys, by a ſlight Structure, and are rather entangled one with another, and hang together like a piece of Spunge, Hoar-Froſt, or a Flake of Snow, than ſtrictly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, whence they become very porus and friable; or if when more cloſely complicated and connected, they grow to a greater Bulk, and create great Pain either in the Kidneys or the Ureters, by grating the Membranes with their unequal and ragged Figure in their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0384600100:37"/>or by their too large and diſproportionate Size, ſtop at the Entrance, or in their Way through theſe Tubes, in ſuch Caſes, the proper Remedies do remove them from the Kidneys, and oblige them to paſs the Uteters into the Bladder, are ſuch as theſe.</p>

It is therefore evident to a Demonſtration, that no total Suppreſſion of the Urine can happen, where both the Ureters are not entirely ſtopped; and it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how at any Time two Stones ſhould at once fall down, one from each Kidney, and ſtop in the ſame Inſtant, each of thoſe Organs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0384600100:49"/>of Separation: If therefore a full Stoppage of Water happens, and neither of the Ureters was before that Time obſtructed, it is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reaſon, that we ſhould aſſign another Cauſe of that Event, that is, a paralytick Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of the ſecretory ſmall Tubes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary Glands, which ſtrain the Serum from the Blood, through the Kidneys and Ureters, into the Bladder; for if theſe ſecretory Tubes by a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> affecting the Spirits reſiding in them, quite loſe their Tenſion and falling flat together cloſe up their <hi>Foramina,</hi> or Paſſages, no Serum can be longer ſeparated from the Blood, or conveyed into the Receptacle of the Urine; and this will prove as effectual and adaequate a Cauſe of a total Obſtruction of Urine, as if both the Ureters were compleatly ſtopped by the falling of two Stones of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate Size into their Mouths.

               <p>The Forms of ſuch Medicines that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Digeſtion in the Stomach, are ſuch as theſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Remedies, moderate Exerciſe, pure and well ventilated Air, Regularity and Temperance, in Eating and Drinking, muſt be carefully obſerved, without which the beſt Methods of Phyſick may be unavailing.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe Medicines called by the <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſicians <hi>Lithontriptica,</hi> that is, ſuch as break and diſſolve the Stone, either in the Kidneys or Bladder, and to which many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks have pretended, aſſuring us that they gradually wear and crumble it away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

It is true, that the celebrated <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> General <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as Hiſtorians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, found means by Vinegar, or ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſharp and acid Liquor, to diſſolve the <hi>Alpine</hi> Rocks, and ſo to eat his Way through thoſe Mountains into <hi>Italy.</hi> But if any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, afflicted with the Stone, ſhould ſwallow a proper Quantity of this powerful Fluid, were it to be had, or any other of like Vertue, ſince it muſt firſt undergo a great Alteration by the Ferment and digeſtive Faculty of the Stomach, and then a farther by mixing with the bilious Humours deſcending from the Gall-Bladder, and afterwards with the acid Juices iſſuing from the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and then another by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the lacteal Strainers, and mingling its Stores with the Lympha brought by numerous Water-Pipes into the common Receptacles; then another by its Admiſſion into the Veins, where during repeated Circulations with great Celerity, the Parts by innumerable Attritions, Reverberations, and Glances from their violent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For no a cid Juices, not Vinegar itſelf, continue acid after they have mingled and circulated with the Blood, and have felt for ſome Time, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive Power of its active Principles.</p>
               <p>Thoſe bold Perſons therefore that pretend to be Maſters of Remedies, which given by the Mouth, will break or diſſolve the Stone in the Kidneys, or the Bladder, impoſe upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, not only becauſe the Medicine loſes its peculiar Qualities, by undergoing ſuch a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Changes and Alterations, as have been enumerated, but likewiſe by mingling and being diluted with above Twenty Pound of Blood, (for few Men have leſs) and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly running its Circuit with it, by which means it becomes quite another Thing, before it reaches the Stone it was deſigned to diſſolve or crumble to pieces.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0384600100:56"/>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, that as above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, there are ſome porus, light, and friable Stones, whoſe Conſtructure is ſo ſlight, that they will by a little Shock or Colliſion, crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and be divided into ſmall Fragments, while the Parts of others ſo ſtrictly cohere, that they are ſcarcely capable of Separation; and it is of theſe harder and more ſolid Stones that I ſpeak, when I ſay they cannot be broken, or cut in pieces, by Remedies given at the Mouth, but they defy the Edge of the keeneſt <hi>Lithon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triptick</hi> Weapon in all the Arſenals of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore Stones or Gravel are at any Time removed from the Kidneys, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Urine, it is not by Vertue of any Stone-breaking Medicine, acting upon them, but by the Operation of its diuretick Quality, exciting a great Separation of Serum, which ruſhing in a ſwift Current through the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, waſhes away in its Streams the Gravel and Stones lodged there, that by their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Magnitude are capable of paſſing the Ureters, as a ſudden Storm or ſharp Shower of Rain, rolls down the Streets in its Torrent, the Sand and looſe Stones, as well as other promiſcuous Impurities to be carried off by the common Drain: Though it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſometimes this Flood of Serum,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0384600100:57"/>tranſmitted from the Veins by its immoderate Quantity, as well as the Strength of its Tide, in its Paſſage through the Kidneys, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſunite, and ſhatter to Pieces ſome ſmaller friable Stones, whoſe Parts hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a very ſlight Connexion.</p>
               <p>But if Nature or Art can afford any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, that are capable of breaking a hard large Stone in the Bladder, the moſt probable Way of making them effectual, would be to inject them directly into the Bladder; for then, having undergone none of thoſe various Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations above enumerated, which thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies muſt do that are taken by the Mouth, they would exert their Stone-diſſolving Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, if they have any, entire and undiminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would have the great Advantage of acting upon it by immediate Contact, by which means the Stone in the Bladder, if it could be effected by Medicines, would be waſted and moulder away. But Experience ſhews that this is not found practicable; for were ſuch a Medicine diſcovered, it would prevent the Tortures and Miſery of many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Patients, and make the uſeful Art of Cutting for the Stone unneceſſary, of which I ſhall ſpeak afterwards.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0384600100:58"/>
               <p>When large Stones are bred in the Kidneys, or ſuch as cannot paſs, but with great Pain and Difficulty, all forcing diuretick Medicines muſt, be forborn, and only ſuch as are ſmooth, oily, and ſlippery ſhould be employed; leſt ſuch as powerfully provoke Urine, ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb and puſh forward the bigger, that lay quiet in the Kidneys, into the Ureters, where they will either ſtop at the Entrance, or ſtick in the Paſſage, and by that Means either ſhut up the Mouth, or create a violent Fit of Pain, together with bloody Urine, if their Surface be rough and ragged; and therefore in ſuch Caſes, ſlimy, ſoft, and mucilaginous Remedies, are chiefly to be depended on, to promote the ſlipping of the Stone into the Bladder: And if active Diureticks, have been employed in vain to puſh on the Stone, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in a violent Paroxyſm, opiate Medicines of good Force ſhould be given, that the Fibres of the encloſing Membranes, whilſt ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Torture of the Stone, and urged by the Medicine deſigned to expel it, being eaſed and lulled by their narcotick Vertue, may ceaſe to contract themſelves and claſp the Stone ſo cloſely, and by dilating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing themſelves while at Eaſe, may make Way for it to ſlide through into the Bladder.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0384600100:59"/>But if the Stone in the Kidneys is large, ſolid, and branches through their Subſtance, no Means at all ſhould be uſed for its Cure; for if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>here are any Remedies that have Power to break and diſlodge its Fragments, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as I have ſaid, there are not, what would that be, but to ſend them down to ſtop the Ureters, or to give unſufferable Torments, by ſticking in their Channels!</p>
               <p>As to the Stone in the Bladder, which, as ſaid above, is no more than a Stone firſt bred in the Kidney, and thence conveyed through the Ureters; where it receives its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long Figure, into the Bladder, and gains there ſuch a Magnitude, that it becomes incapable of being expelled with the Urine, being fed and augmented continually with new Gritt and ſandy Materials waſhed from the Kidneys and falling down into the Bladder; when it firſt deſcends into that Receptacle, and its Size does not exceed a due Proportion, while it floats in the Urine, it often plays, aims, and offers at the Orifice of the Urethra, but its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or Poſition not being accommodated to it, cannot paſs through that urinary Channel; and then it not only creates great Uneaſineſs, by lying croſs its Mouth, but likewiſe often by interrupting the Streams of Urine, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0384600100:60"/>by totally obſtructing the Paſſage. When the Gravel, or Stone, or Stones, are yet ſmall enough to enter and paſs the Urethr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate their Diſcharge, the Veins ſhould be filled with ſuch diuretick Liquors, as I have before ſet down, that they may communicate a conſtant Flow of Urine to the Bladder, which being commonly kept full, will be the more apt to eject the Stone, together with the Flood that diſtends it. But if it grows ſo great, that it becomes unable to make its Way, by Reaſon of its diſproportionate Size, it will be daily augmented by the Accretion or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new Gritt or Gravel, carried from the Kidneys, through the Ureters, by the Streams of Urine, as Sand and ſmall Stones, are rolled along from a riſing Ground, by Rills of Water, that flow down its Sides. Now theſe Sands or minute Concretions, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained above, are the Seeds, or Mother of the Stone, that is, the Principles or firſt Materials, that combine for the Formation of it in the Kidneys, and afterwards to its Augmentation in the Bladder; and to hinder its encreaſing there to a great Magnitude, thoſe Remedies are to be uſed which were enumerated before, for cutting off the Generation of Gravel, and ſuch ſandy and fabulous Combinations; to which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0384600100:61"/>
               <p>But if through Neglect, or the Inability of Methods and Medicines to prevent the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sand and Gravel in the Kidneys, which waſhed away by the Urine into the Bladder, conſtantly feed and amplify the Stones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined there, which grow not like Animals and Vegetables, by Nouriſhment admitted by the Mouth or the Root, and conveyed and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the outward Parts from the inward, but by the daily Acceſs, Accumulation, and Adheſion, of hard, ſandy Particles to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Stone; if, I ſay, the Stone, by the Arrival and Complication of new petrifying Principles, becomes large and ponderous, and being attended with a terrible Train of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that render the Patient a great Object of Compaſſion, while Death is more eligible than Life, and no effectual Means can be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, how it may be cut, diſſolved, or crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to pieces, as I have before demonſtrated, all that can be done by Medicine, is to quiet or reduce the enormous Pains and Torments, inflicted by this cruel Diſeaſe; and for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this, only <hi>crude Opium,</hi> or its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, the Gift of Divine Benignity to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the Tortures, and alleviate the extream Miſeries of Mankind, can be depended on. This is the Patient's Refuge, and the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0384600100:62"/>to allay his Agonies, and reſtrain the Rage of his Sufferings. And therefore in this Caſe, let him take the following Pills.</p>

                  <hi>Take of Saffron, beat ſmall, three Grains; of Extract of Gentian, ſix Grains; of crude Opium diſſolved and ſtrained, a Grain and half; Balſamick Syrup, enough to make it into Pills, for one Doſe, to be taken in violent Pains, and repeated when the Force of the firſt is worn off, if the Torments continue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Quantity of <hi>Opium</hi> preſcribed, is not ſufficient to remove the Pain, it may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually be encreaſed, by adding a Quarter of a Grain; and if that likewiſe ſhould be ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, add half a Grain, and ſo on, till the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has found what is the juſt Quantity that will relieve him, and when he has taken his Meaſure, and ſettled the Proportion, he will be obliged to take it as often as his Agonies ſhall make it abſolutely neceſſary. All ſmooth, ſoft, and ſlippery Meats and Drinks, as well as Medicines muſt be choſen; for thoſe of an oppoſite Nature will irritate and enrage the Paroxyſm, eſpecially if an Ulcer
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0384600100:63"/>attends the Stone, which is an incurable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: And as Ulcers produced either in the Kidneys, or the Neck of the Bladder, from other Cauſes beſides the Stone, elude the Force of all Remedies, which is likewiſe the Caſe of all other internal Ulcers in the Lungs, Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo thoſe, that ariſe from the Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Laceration of the Membranes in the Kidneys or the Bladder, by Stones of a rough and ragged Superficies, can never be healed, at leaſt while the Stone continuing there, is always wearing and wounding the Part where it lodges: And therefore all that can be done, is to drink plentifully of ſmooth, and ſoft Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, beſides taking ſlippery and oily Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that may conſtantly dilute and waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ulcerous Matter, leſt gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in too great a Quantity, it ſhould ſtop the Paſſage of the Urine; which Obſtruction is ſometimes ſo great, that the Surgeon's Hand is neceſſarily required to paſs his Catheter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bladder, for the Relief of the Patient, through which the impriſoned Urine may flow freely out; and the Patient is obliged to fly to this Refuge for Eaſe, as often as Clyſters and other Medicines ingeſted by the Mouth are ineffectual. The ſoft and ſmooth Liquors that may aſſiſt the Patient, by diluting the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0384600100:64"/>corrupt Matter, and making it fit to flow, are <hi>Mead,</hi> or other Liquors made of <hi>Honey;</hi> alſo Decoctions of <hi>Barley, Liquoriſh, Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, dryed Figgs, and Raiſins of the Sun, ſtoned;</hi> or rather, the following Apozem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Flowers of Mallows, an handful; of Root of Marſh-mallows, half an Ounce; of ſweet Fennel-Root, an Ounce; of Leaves of Violet, Parietaria, each a Pugil; of Aniſe and Carraway Seeds, each a Drachm and half; boil all in three Pints of Spring-Water, to a Quart, ſtrain it, and add of Syrup of Marſh-mallows, three Ounces; and ſix Drachms of the Tincture of Saffron, made with Treacle-Water; drink half a Pint, or ſix Ounces of it, three Times a Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſmootheſt and ſofteſt Spring-Water, ſhould be choſen for common Drink, ſuch as that of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> or any other, that riſes from Chalk-Hills: A good Draught likewiſe of <hi>White-wine,</hi> and <hi>new Ale,</hi> [mind this] now and then repeated, is uſeful to diſlodge and carry off the noxious and impure Matter, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an Ulcer in the Kidneys or Bladder; and the Sediment of each of them is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0384600100:65"/>by their ſlimy, glutinous and ropy Quality, from the white, mealy and light Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, found often in the Urine, from ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Cauſes, as above ſuggeſted, that by ſhaking the Glaſs, will preſently riſe and float in the Boſom of it, which however has no weight, nor viſcous, nor gritty Quality, but ſwims in pale, diſcontinued, and incoherent Matter, communicated to the Urine from the Blood, abounding with ſuch Impurities. And they are diſcriminated from one another, by a faetid and offenſive Smell, proper to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcharged from an Ulcer in the Bladder, and contracted from long mixing with the Urine, which is not found in thoſe ſlimy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents that flow down from the Kidneys, and are excluded with the ſerous Streams, as I have above explained.</p>
               <p>After all, when notwithſtanding the due Care and Obſervance of the beſt Rules to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, the Stone in the Bladder grows very large, and the Pains are greater than Humane Patience can bear, the laſt Refuge from this dreadful Tormentor, is manual Operation, when Inciſion is made into the Bladder, and the Stone extracted through the Wound. So ſtrong is the Principle of Self-Preſervation, and ſo terrible the Idea and Apprehenſion of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0384600100:66"/>Death, that to continue a little longer in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Men ſubmit, not only to a great Variety of lingering Sufferings and Calamities, but likewiſe to the acuteſt Fains, or which their yeilding to this Method of curing the Stone, is a moſt convincing Evidence.</p>
               <p>Though the Cutting for the Stone is a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Operation, and attended with the Hazard of Life, yet many Patients have been relieved by it, and continued well after it for many Years, eſpecially thoſe, that were Cut in their Youth. Yet it muſt be acknowledged, that many alſo have miſcarried, either from the Nature of the Stone, their ill Habit of Body, the Unskilfulneſs of the Operator, or his want or ſufficient knowledge in Surgery to heal the Wound. And this Misfortune often happens likewiſe from the Patient's deferring the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration too long, out of an Abhorrence of the Violence of the Cure, or from flattering Hopes that the Diſeaſe will not ariſe to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and torment them with ſuch inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Symptoms. It is therefore the Intereſt of Perſons afflicted with it, to undergo the Operation, by which the Stone is extracted, when as yet it is of a moderate Size, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more Eaſily to be drawn through the Wound, and before their Strength is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0384600100:67"/>by long Sufferings, and repeated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms of Torture, and before the Ulcer that is often formed by it, becomes deep and inveterate; and then, while their Vigour is unwaſted, and their Conſtitution otherwiſe hail, and the Stone not of an extraordinary Magnitude, the Operation is likely to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful: And if theſe Rules were obſerved, the Lives of many of theſe unhappy Patients might be ſaved, that are loſt for want of a timely Submiſſion to this Method of Cure.</p>
               <p>When the Stone, lapſed from the Kidneys into the Bladder, are not augmented there to that Proportion, as makes them incapable of entering into the Mouth of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> yet ſometimes after it has entered, it is however too large to make its Way through that Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and therefore ſtops in the Road, where it not only creates great Pain, but likewiſe obſtructs the Current of the Water, till at length there is no Remedy left but the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Art, who in this Caſe eaſily relieves the Sufferer, by cutting upon the Stone where he feels it lodged, and thruſting it forth through the Orifice of the Wound: And this is the moſt practicable and leaſt dangerous Inſtance of Cutting for the Stone.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0384600100:68"/>
               <p>As for Cutting into the Bladder, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Stone thence, various Methods have been invented, of which a diſtinct and accurate Hiſtory is not the Buſineſs of this Diſſertation: It is enough for me in this Place to mention the moſt Practicable and ſafeſt Way, and this, as I am informed, is that of cutting into the Bladder, in the Region above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> lately brought into Uſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there occur any dark and obſcure Hints of this Practice in ancient or modern Authors, or whether the firſt Invention does Honour to the ingenious Surgeon Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> it is certain, that either as Reviver or Inventor of this new Method, he has deſeryed well of Mankind, and merited the Thanks and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of all the Faculty, ſince all Ways of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this Operation known before, were accompanied with more difficulty, more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and greater Hazard of Life.</p>
               <p>Before the Patient conſents to undergo this Method of Cure, great Care and Caution ſhould be uſed, that the Operator may be ſure himſelf, and ſo able to ſatisfy the Patient, that there is a Stone in the Bladder, the Cauſe of all his painful Symptoms, and fit to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. For there have been other Diſeaſes of the Bladder, that have ſo perfectly imitated
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0384600100:69"/>the Stone in all its Symptoms, and have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon Surgeons, eminent in their Art, who after ſtrict Search have pronounced the Caſe to be the Stone, yet when they have cut the Patient to relieve him, no Stone has been found, and upon opening the dead Body, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Fungus,</hi> or ſome Excreſcency, grown to a great Bigneſs in the Neck of the Bladder, or ſome other Diſeaſe, or Errour of Nature in the Bladder, appeared to be the only Cauſe of all the Nephretick-like Symptoms, that afflicted the Patient: And therefore, I ſay, the Undertaker, before he attempts the Operation, ought with the greateſt Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and moſt careful Scrutiny, to get the fulleſt Conviction in himſelf, of the real Exiſtence of the Stone in the Place he expects to find it.</p>
