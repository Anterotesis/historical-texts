            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG the ſeveral degrees of authors, there are none perhaps,
who have more obſtacles to ſurmount at their ſetting out, than the
writers of periodical eſſays. Talk with a modern critic, and he will tell
you, that to ſet up a new paper is a vain attempt after the inimitable
SPECTATORS and others; that the ſubjects are already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied, and that
it is equally impoſſible to find out a new field for obſervation, as to
diſcover a new world. With theſe prejudices the public are prepared to
receive us; and while they expect to be cloyed with the ſtale repetition of
the ſame fare, though toſſed up in a different manner, they have but
little reliſh for the entertainment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:1252700302:3"/>THAT the SPECTATOR firſt led the way,
muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be acknowledged: but that his followers muſt for that
reaſon be always ſuppoſed to tread in his ſteps, can by no means be
allowed. In the high road of life there are ſeveral extenſive walks, as
well as bye-paths, which we may ſtrike into, without the neceſſity of
keeping the ſame beaten track with thoſe that have gone before us. New
objects for ridicule will continually preſent themſelves; and even the
ſame characters will appear different by being differently diſpoſed, as
in the ſame pack of cards, though ever ſo often ſhuffled, there will
never be two hands exactly alike.</p>
               <p>AFTER this introduction I hope to be pardoned, if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
myſelf in ſpeaking a word or two concerning my own endeavours to entertain
the public; which I imagine I could never do with ſo good a grace, as at the
beginning of my ſecond volume. And firſt, whatever objections the reader
may have had to the ſubjects of my papers, I ſhall make no apology for the
manner in which I have choſe to treat them. The dread of falling into (what
they are pleaſed to call) colloquial barbariſms has induced ſome
unſkilful writers to ſwell their bloated diction with uncouth phraſes and
the affected jargon of pedants. For my own part, I never go out of the common
way of expreſſion, merely for the ſake of introducing a more ſounding
word with a <hi>Latin</hi> termination. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> language is
ſufficiently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and expreſſive without any further adoption of new
terms; and the native words ſeem to me to have far more force than any
foreign auxiliaries, however pompouſly uſhered in: as <hi>Britiſh</hi>
ſoldiers fight our battles better than the troops taken into our pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:1252700302:4"/>THE ſubjects of my eſſays have been
chiefly ſuch, as I thought might recommend themſelves to the public notice
by being new and uncommon. For this reaſon I purpoſely avoided the worn out
practice of retailing ſcraps of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and affecting to dogmatize on the
common duties of life. In this point, indeed, the SPECTATOR is inimitable; nor
could I hope to ſay any thing new upon theſe topics after ſo many
excellent moral and religious eſſays, which, are the principal ornament of
his work. I have therefore contented myſelf with expoſing vice and folly by
painting the actors in their natural colours, without aſſuming the
rigidneſs of a preacher, or the moroſeneſs of a philoſopher. I have
oftener choſe to undermine our faſhionable exceſſes by ſecret
ſapping, than to ſtorm them by open aſſaults. In a word, upon all
occaſions I have endeavoured to laugh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into a better behaviour; as I
am convinced, that the ſting of reproof is not leſs ſharp for being
concealed; and advice never comes with a better face, than when it comes with a
laughing one.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome points in the courſe of this work, which
perhaps might have been treated of with a more ſerious air. I have thought it
my duty to take every opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the abſurd tenets of our
modern free-thinkers and enthuſiaſts. The enthuſiaſt is, indeed, much
more difficult to cure than the free-thinker; becauſe the latter, with all
his bravery, cannot but be conſcious that he is wrong; whereas the former has
perhaps deceived himſelf into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that he is certainly in the right,
and the more he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the more he conſiders himſelf as 
<q rend="inline">"patiently ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the truth's
ſake."</q> Ignorance is too ſtubborn to yield to conviction; and on the
other hand thoſe, whom <pb n="424" facs="tcp:1252700302:5"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">"a little learning has made mad,"</q> are too
proud and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to hearken to the ſober voice of reaſon. The
only way left us, therefore, is to root out ſuperſtition, by making its
followers aſhamed of themſelves: and as for our free-thinkers, it is but
right to turn their boaſted weapons of ridicule againſt them; and as they
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves endeavour to banter all others out of their ſerious and
virtuous notions, we too (in the language of the Pſalmiſt) ſhould 
<q rend="inline">"laugh them to ſcorn, and have them in
deriſion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT whatever merit I may aſſume to myſelf from my
writings, I muſt at the ſame time confeſs myſelf indebted to ſeveral
correſpondents for many excellent pieces; and more particularly to the
gentlemen, who have ſigned themſelves A. B. and G. K. As I know not the
real names of any of my correſpondents, I am not without ſome hopes, that I
have been honoured by an Earl or a Right Honourable at leaſt: for to ſay
the truth, I cannot at preſent apply to myſelf the known boaſt of
<hi>Terence,</hi> 
                  <q> 
                     <l>—Homines nobiles</l> 
                     <l>Eum adjutare, aſſiduèque unà
ſcribere.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is with infinite pleaſure, that I find myſelf ſo much
encouraged to continue my labours, by the kind reception which they have
hitherto met with from the public: and Mr. <hi>Baldwin</hi> with no leſs
pleaſure informs me, that as there are but few numbers left of the preſent
edition, he intends to collect them into Two Pocket Volumes. The reader cannot
conceive, how much I already pride myſelf on the charming figure, which my
works will make in this new <pb n="425" facs="tcp:1252700302:6"/> form: and I ſhall endeavour
to render theſe volumes as complete as I poſſibly can, by ſeveral
conſiderable additions and amendments. Though contracted into the ſmall
ſpace of a twelves volume, I ſtill hope to maintain my former dignity; like
the Devils in <hi>Milton's Pandaemonium,</hi> who, 
<q> 
                     <l>—To ſmalleſt forms</l> 
                     <l>Reduc'd their ſhapes immenſe, and were at
large.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE SPECTATOR has very elegantly compared his ſingle papers,
as they came out, to 
<q rend="inline">"cherries on a ſtick,"</q> of the dearneſs
of which the purchaſers cannot complain, who are willing to gratify their
taſte with choice fruit at its earlieſt production. I have conſidered my
own papers as ſo many flowers, which joined together would make up a pretty
noſegay; and though each of them, ſingly taken, may not be equally admired
for their odours, they may receive an additional fragrance by an happy union of
their ſweets.</p>
               <p>CUSTOM hath lately introduced a new faſhion among
eſſay-writers, of giving tranſlations of the mottos for the benefit of
the ladies. But (as <hi>Denham</hi> has remarked of tranſlation in general) 
<q rend="inline">"the ſpirit of the original is evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in
the transfuſion, and nothing is left behind but a mere <hi>caput
mortuum.</hi>"</q> Tranſlations, however, muſt be given; and it has been
the uſual way to copy them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly from <hi>Dryden</hi> or
<hi>Francis:</hi> though they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very wide of the intended
ſenſe of the original, and not unfrequently nothing to the purpoſe. For
this reaſon I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to give new tranſlations, or rather imitations, of
all the mottos and quotations, adapted to the preſent times. Some of theſe
will admit of epigrammatic turns; and many of <pb n="426" facs="tcp:1252700302:7"/> them will
afford room for lively and pictureſque allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to modern manners. In
this dreſs they will at leaſt appear more of a piece with the eſſays
themſelves; and not like the patch-work of random tranſlations.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time, I ſhall only add, that if any Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Gentleman, or Rich Citizen, is ambitious to have his name prefixed to either of
theſe volumes, he is deſired to ſend in propoſals, together with a
liſt of his virtues and good qualities, to the publiſher; and the
Dedications ſhall be diſpoſed of to the beſt bidder.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:1252700302:9"/>BALLADS ſeem peculiarly adapted to the
genius of our people; and are a ſpecies of compoſition, in which we are
ſuperior to all other nations. Many of our old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Songs have
in them an affecting ſimplicity; and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that our beſt
writers have not been aſhamed to cultivate this branch of poetry. <hi>Cowley,
Waller; Rofcommon, Rowe, Gay, Prior,</hi> and many others, have left behind
them very elegant Ballads; but it muſt be confeſſed, to the honour of the
preſent age, that it was reſerved for our modern writers to bring this kind
of poetry to perfection. Song-writing is now reduced to certain rules of art,
and the Ballad-maker goes to work by a method as regular and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, as a
carpenter or a blackſmith.</p>
               <p>SWIFT, in his "Voyage to <hi>Laputa,</hi>" deſcribes a
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine to write books in all arts and ſciences: I have alſo read of a
mill to make verſes; and remember to have ſeen a curious table, by the
aſſiſtance of which the moſt illiterate might amuſe themſelves in
compoſing hexameters and pentameters in <hi>Latin:</hi> Inventions
wonderfully calculated for the promotion of literature. Whatever gentlemen of
<hi>Grub-ſtreet</hi> or others are ambitious to inliſt themſelves as
hackney ſonetteers, are deſired to attend to the following rules, drawn
from the practice of our modern ſong-writers: a ſet of geniuſſes
excellent in their manner, and who will probably be hereafter as much known and
admired as Garden-Poets, as the celebrated <hi>Taylor</hi> is now famous under
the denomination of Water-Poet.</p>
               <p>I MUST beg leave poſſitively to contradict any reports,
inſinuating that our Ballad-makers are in poſſeſſion of ſuch a
machine, mill, or table as above-mentioned; and believe <pb n="429" facs="tcp:1252700302:10"/>
it to be equally falſe, that it is their practice to huſtle certain quaint
terms and phraſes together in a hat, and take them out at random. It has,
indeed, been aſſerted on ſome juſt ground, that their productions are
totally void of ſenſe and expreſſion, that they have little rhyme and
leſs reaſon, and that they are from beginning to end nothing more than
nonſenſical rhapſodies to a new tune. This charge I do not mean to deny:
though I cannot but lament the deplorable want of taſte, that mentions it as
a fault. For it is this very circumſtance, which I, who am profeſſedly a
CONNOISSEUR, particularly admire. It is a received maxim with all compoſers
of muſic, that nothing is ſo melodious as nonſenſe. Manly ſenſe is
too harſh and ſtubborn to go through the numberleſs diviſions and
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions of modern muſic, and to be trilled forth in crotchets and
demiquavers. For this reaſon, thought is ſo cautiouſly ſprinkled over a
modern ſong; which it is the buſineſs of the ſinger to warble into
harmony and ſentiment.</p>
               <p>OUR Ballad-makers for the moſt part ſlide into the familiar
ſtile, and affect that eaſy manner of writing, which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
<hi>Wycherley)</hi> is eaſily written. Seeing the dangerous conſequence of
meaning, in words adapted to muſic, they are very frugal of ſentiment: and
indeed they huſband it ſo well, that the ſame thoughts are adapted to
every ſong. The only variation requiſite in twenty ballads is, that the
laſt line of the ſtanza be different. In this ingenious line the wit of the
whole ſong conſiſts; and the author, whether <hi>he ſhall die if he has
not the laſs of the mill,</hi> or <hi>deſerves to be reckon'd an
aſs,</hi> turns over his dictionary of rhymes for words of a ſimilar
ſound, and every verſe jingles to the ſame word <pb n="430" facs="tcp:1252700302:11"/>
with all the agreeable variety of a ſet of bells eternally ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
ſame peal.</p>
               <p>THE authors of love-ſongs formerly waſted a great deal of
poetry in illuſtrating their own paſſion and the beauty of their
miſtreſs; but our modern poets content themſelves with falling in love
with her name. There cannot be a greater misfortune to one of theſe rhymers
than a miſtreſs with a hard name; ſuch a misfortune ſends them all over
the world and makes them run through all arts, ſciences, and languages for
correſpondent terms: and after all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the name is ſo harſh and
untractable, that our poet has as much difficulty to bring it into verſe, as
the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braters of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> were puzzled to reduce to
rhyme the uncouth names of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Towns taken in Queen
<hi>Anne</hi>'s wars. <hi>Valentine</hi> in <hi>Love for Love,</hi> when he
talks of turning poet, orders <hi>Jeremy</hi> to get the maids together of an
evening to Crambo: no contemptible hint to our Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, and which, if
properly made uſe of, would be of as much ſervice to them as <hi>Byſhe's
Art of Poetry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FEARING leſt this method of ſong-writing ſhould one day
grow obſolete, in order to preſerve to poſterity ſome idea of it, I
have put together the following dialogue as a ſpecimen of the modern manner.
I muſt, however, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous enough to confeſs, that I can claim no
farther me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in this elegant piece than that of a compiler. It is a Canto
from our moſt celebrated new ſongs; from which I have carefully culled all
the ſweeteſt flowers of poetry, and bound them up together for the delight
and wonder of the world. As all the lines are taken from different ſongs
ſet to different tunes, I would humbly propoſe that this curious 
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:1252700302:12"/> performance ſhould be ſung jointly by all the beſt
voices, in the manner of a <hi>Dutch</hi> concert, where every man ſings his
own tune. I had once ſome thoughts of affixing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal references to each
line, to inform the reader by note at what place the ſong whence it is taken
was firſt ſung. But I ſhall ſpare myſelf that trouble by deſiring
the reader to look on the whole piece as ariſing from a coalition of our
moſt eminent ſong-writers at <hi>Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> and
<hi>Sadler's Wells:</hi> aſſuring him, that this ſhort dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue contains
the pith and marrow, or rather (to borrow an expreſſion from the Fine Lady
in <hi>Lethe)</hi> the <hi>Quinſetence</hi> and <hi>Emptity</hi> of all our
modern ſongs.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ALKING the other, day in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey, among
the many oftentatious monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments erected to kings and warriors, I could not
help obſerving a little ſtone, on which was this pompous
inſcription—<hi>Aeternae Memoriae Sacrum</hi>—Sacred to the
Eternal Memory of —. The name of the perſon, to whom immortality was
thus ſecured, is almoſt obliterated; and perhaps, when alive, he was little
known, and as ſoon forgot by the ſmall circle of his friends and
acquaintance.</p>
               <p>I HAVE been uſed to look upon epitaphs as a kind of flattering
dedications to the dead; in which is ſet down a long catalogue of virtues,
(that nobody knew they were <pb n="434" facs="tcp:1252700302:15"/> poſſeſſed of while
living) and not a word of their vices or follies. The veracity of theſe
poſthumous encomiums may, indeed, be fairly ſuſpected, as we are
generally told, that the diſconſolate widow, or weeping ſon, erected the
monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in teſtimony of their affliction for the loſs of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
huſband, or moſt affectionate father. But what dowager, who gets a
comfortable jointure by her good man's deceaſe, would refuſe to ſet her
hand to it on his tomb-ſtone, that he was the beſt of huſbands; though
perhaps they had parted beds? or what heir would be ſo baſe and ungrateful,
as not to give a few good words to a crabbed parent after his death, in return,
for his eſtate?</p>
               <p>BY the extravagant praiſes, which are indiſcriminately
laviſhed on the aſhes of every perſon alike, we entirely pervert the
original intent of epitaphs, which were contrived to do honour and juſtice to
the virtuous and the good: But by the preſent practice the reputations of men
are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with their duſt in the grave, where there is no
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the good and the bad. The law has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſearchers
to enquire, when any one dies, into the cauſe of his death: in the ſame
manner I could wiſh, that ſearchers were appointed to examine into his way
of living, before a character be given of him upon the tomb-ſtone.</p>
               <p>THE flatteries, that are paid to the deceaſed, are
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly owing to the pride of their ſurvivors, which is the ſame among
the loweſt as the higheſt ſet of people. When an obſcure grocer or
tallow-chandler dies at his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> the news-papers
are ſtuffed with the ſame parade of his virtues and good qualities, as when
a duke, goes out of the world: and the petty overſeer of a little 
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:1252700302:16"/> hamlet has a painted board with the initials of his name
ſtuck up at the end of his wicker'd turf, while the noblemen repoſes under
a grand mauſoleum erected to his memory, with a long liſt of his titles and
heroic deeds.</p>
               <p>THE Great, indeed, have found means to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
even in their graves from the vulgar, by having their aſhes depoſited in
churches and cathedrals, and covered by the moſt ſuperb monuments. In my
late viſit to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, I could not but remark the
difference of Taſte, which has prevailed in ſetting up theſe edifices for
the dead. In former times, we find, that they were content to clap up the
buſt or ſtatue of the deceaſed, ſet round perhaps with the emblems of
his merits, his employment, or ſtation of life. If any perſon was
remarkable for his virtue and piety, it was pointed out by two or three little
chubby-faced che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, who were crying for his death, or holding a crown over
his head. The warriour was ſpread along at full length in a complete ſuit
of armour, with the trophies of war hung round about him; and the biſhop was
laid flat upon his back, with his coifed head reſting on a ſtone bible, and
his hands joined together in the poſture of praying.</p>
               <p>IF <hi>Socrates,</hi> or any other of the ancient Philoſophers
could revive again, and be admitted into <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, he
would be induced to fancy himſelf in a <hi>Pantheon</hi> of the Heathen Gods.
The Modern Taſte, (not content with introducing <hi>Roman</hi> temples into
our Churches, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Virtues under allegorical images) has
ranſacked all the fabulous accounts of the Heathen Theology to ſtrike out
new embelliſhments for our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> monuments. We are not in the
leaſt ſurpriſed to ſee <hi>Mercury</hi> attending <pb n="336" facs="tcp:1252700302:17"/>
the tomb of an orator, and <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Hercules</hi> ſupporting
that of a warriour. <hi>Milton</hi> has been blamed for his frequent
alluſions to the Heathen Theology in his Sacred Poem: but ſurely we are
more to be condemned, for admitting the whole claſs of their fictitious
deities into the Houſe of God itſelf.</p>
               <p>IF there is not a ſtop put to this Taſte, we may ſoon
expect to ſee our churches, inſtead of being dedicated to the ſervice of
religion, ſet apart for the reception of the Heathen Gods. A deceaſed
admiral will be repreſented like <hi>Neptune,</hi> with a trident in his
hand, drawn in a ſhell by dolphins, preceded by <hi>Tritons,</hi> and
followed by <hi>Nereids</hi> laſhing the marble waves with their tails. A
general will be habited like <hi>Mars,</hi> bearing an helmet and ſpear in
poliſhed ſtone; and a celebrated toaſt will be ſtuck up naked, like the
<hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de Medicis,</hi> cut in alabaſter.</p>
               <p>IT has been propoſed (on a different account) to have a
ſeparate place diſtinct from our churches, for the reception of our
monuments. I could wiſh to ſee ſuch a ſcheme put in execution: for the
preſent abſurd mixture of the ſeveral objects of <hi>Pagan</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> belief, as repreſented on the tombs lately ſet up in
compliance of the modern taſte, muſt be ſhocking to every ſerious
beholder. Our pious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were content with exhibiting to us the uſual
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of death, the hour-glaſs, the ſkull, and the croſs-marrow-bones:
but theſe are not ſufficient for our preſent more refined age: The Three
Fatal Siſters, mentioned in the Heathen Mythology, muſt be introduced
ſpinning, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cutting the thread of life. Could one of the laſt
century ſee a winged figure blowing a trumpet on the top <pb n="337" facs="tcp:1252700302:18"/> of a modern monument, he would be apt to miſtake it for an
arch-angel, and be naturally put in mind of that awful time, 
<q rend="inline">"when the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead
ſhall riſe."</q> But the deſign, we are told, is very different; and this
winged meſſenger is no other than the ancient perſonage of Fame, who is
proclaiming the virtues of the defunct round the world.</p>
               <p>SHOULD any one propoſe to take down from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral thoſe paintings of Sir <hi>James Thornhill</hi> repreſenting the
tranſactions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and in their place to ſet up
<hi>Titian</hi>'s pictures of the amours of the Heathen Gods and Goddeſſes,
every one would be ſhocked at the impiety of the propoſal. Nor is the
faſhion of introducing Heathen Deities into our monuments much leſs
abſurd: for while any of thoſe are ſuffered to remain in our Churches,
the reproof of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour concerning the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may
perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come applicable to the preſent times— 
<q rend="inline">"My Houſe is an Houſe of Prayer; but ye have
made it a DEN OF THIEVES."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I HOPE I ſhall not be thought too grave or whimſical, if I
earneſtly recommend it to the conſideration of thoſe whom it may concern,
whether a reformation is not neceſſary in our Churches, to purge them from
theſe prophane images; which, though not the objects of our idolatry, have no
more pretence to be ſet up in the Temple of the Living Lord, than thoſe of
the canonized Saints of the <hi>Roman Catholics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MODERN Taſte is continually ſtriking out new improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
We may therefore conclude, that when our ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries <pb n="338" facs="tcp:1252700302:19"/>
have travelled through the ancient <hi>Pantheon,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all the
ſubjects of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, we ſhall
have recourſe to the ſuperſtitions of other nations for the deſigns of
our monuments. They will then probably be adorned with <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Hieroglyphics, and the tomb of ſome future hero may be built according to the
model of the Prophet's tomb at <hi>Mecca.</hi> It is not to be doubted, but
that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Taſte, which has been already introduced into our
gardens, our buildings, and our furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will alſo ſoon find its way
into our Churches; and how elegant muſt a monument appear, which is erected
in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Taſte, and embelliſhed with dragons, bells,
Pagods, and Mandarins!</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no method of reproof more in vogue, than the drawing
invidious parallels between the preſent times and the paſt. The grumbling
politician rails over his coffee at the preſent miniſtry, and reminds you
with a ſigh of the golden Days of Queen <hi>Beſs:</hi> while, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of leſs conſequence, the critic ſhakes his head at Mr. TOWN, and mentions
BICKERSTAFF. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts are above all others devoted to this
practice. Theſe wiſe gentlemen are continually looking backwards, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning what lays immediately before them by retroſpect. They are for
ever harping on this jarring chord, and have <pb n="440" facs="tcp:1252700302:21"/> ſcarce
more words in their mouths than the ſolemn ſentences ſaid to be delivered
by Fryar <hi>Bacon's</hi> Brazen Head, <hi>Time is—Time was—Time is

               </p>
               <p>NO compariſons of this ſort are ſo frequently repeated,
and ſo much inſiſted on, as thoſe drawn between the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and
Moderns. If an eloquent member of the Houſe of Commons is cruelly
ſuſpected of bellowing for a place, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rings in his ears but
<hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi> If a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or perhaps a
nobleman, with a heavy mortgage on his eſtate, diſencumbers it by ſelling
his intereſt at a county election, he is immediately upbraided with one
<hi>Roman</hi> that was not aſhamed to follow the plough-tail, and another
who could refuſe large bribes, and content himſelf with a cottage and
turnips. If a lady makes an unfortunate ſlip, ſhe is told again and again
of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and fifty other ſchool-boy tales of honour and
chaſtity. In a word, there is not one faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frailty but has ſome
ſtubborn antiquated virtue ſet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it; and our unhappy
metropolis is every day threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deſtruction for its degeneracy from
the rigid maxims of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Sparta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the midſt of all theſe ſevere reflections, it gives me
infinite pleaſure, that I can with juſtice take notice of the
inconteſtable ſuperiority of the Moderns in point of Modeſty. The
arrogance of the Ancients was ſo remarkable, that, in their idea of a perfect
character, they included every public and private virtue. They aimed at a
ſtrict obſervance of all the duties of life: and if ſome old
<hi>Romans</hi> had been ſtiled Gods while living, it would not have been
ſuch groſs flattery as was afterwards practiſed, in honouring the
Emperors with an <hi>Apotheoſis.</hi> Their inflexible honeſty was their
perpetual <pb n="441" facs="tcp:1252700302:22"/> boaſt, and their virtue was their pride. This
high idea of a Perfect Character among the Ancients naturally urged them to
lift themſelves to an invidious ſuperiority above the reſt of the world:
while the modeſt Moderns, by taking all the vices inſtead of the virtues
into their notion of a Fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, endeavour to let themſelves down to a
level with the loweſt of their ſpecies, and have laid the ſureſt
foundation for humility. Fine Gentlemen are ſo far from being proud, that
they are never guilty of any thing which gives them the leaſt reaſon to be
ſo: and our Fine Ladies have none of the diſguſting haughtineſs of
virtue, though indeed they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom known to be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>IT is impoſſible to deviſe one method of lowering the good
opinion a man might poſſibly conceive of himſelf, that has not been put
in practice. No Fine Gentleman ever aimed at acquiring any excellence, and if
any natural perfections might give ſome little occaſion for pride, the
greateſt pains have been taken to deſtroy them. Good parts have been often
drowned in drunkenneſs, and a ſtrong conſtitution ſweated away in
bagnios: and in the mean time learning has been totally neglected, leſt
improvement ſhould bring on pedantry and literary pride. The moſt ſhining
parts in the character of a Fine Gentleman are, that he drinks deep,
dreſſes gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly, rides well, can ſhoe his own horſe, and is
poſſeſſed of ſome few other qualifications, which nobody can ever
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a mind the leaſt given to ambition would ever labour to acquire.
For my part I am ſo far from agreeing with our famous ſatiriſt that love
of fame is the univerſal paſſion, that when I obſerve the behaviour of
our Fine Gentlemen, I am apt to think it proceeds from the loweſt and
humbleſt turn of mind: indeed their ſingular modeſty appears to me the 
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:1252700302:23"/> only means of accounting for their actions, which
commonly tend to place them in the meaneſt and moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
light.</p>
               <p>NOTHING but this invincible Modeſty, and fear of ſeeming to
aim at excellence, could ever give riſe to certain habits, not only
ridiculous, but ungraceful. Good eyes, for inſtance, are univerſally
acknowledged to give luſtre to the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet faſhion and
humility have blinded the whole town. The beau draws his eyes out of his
pocket, and the beauties kill us through ſpying-glaſſes. It has been
known to be the vogue for perſons of faſhion to loſe the uſe of their
legs, and limp along as if they were crippled: this practice I daily expect to
be revived, for I take it for granted that the tall ſtaves now carried about
muſt naturally dwindle into crutches. An inarticulate liſp even now infects
the delivery in polite converſation. It is not at all unfaſhionable to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend deafneſs; and unleſs the ladies object to it, I do not deſpair
of ſeeing the time when the whole modiſh world ſhall affect to be
dumb.</p>
               <p>THIS humble way of thinking has been carried ſo far, that it
has even introduced a new ſpecies of hypocriſy. Fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, fearing
leſt their good qualities ſhould in their own deſpite overbalance their
bad ones, claim ſeveral vices to which they have no title. There is
ſomething very admirable and ingenuous in this diſpoſition among our
young people, who not only candidly diſcover all their frailties, but
accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of faults, which they never intended to commit. I know a
young fellow who is almoſt every morning complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the head-ache, and
curſing the laſt night's champagne at the St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s, when I am
well aſſured he paſſed his evening <pb n="441" facs="tcp:1252700302:24"/> very ſoberly
with his maiden aunts in <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> I am alſo acquainted with
another gentleman, who is very fond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his intrigues, and often
modeſtly takes ſhame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the great miſchief he does among
the women; though I well know he is too baſhful even to make love to his
laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. He ſometimes laments publickly the unlucky conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an
amour, and has more than once been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend pill-boxes and
gallipots directed for himſelf, to be left at the bar of neighbouring
coffee-houſes. The ſame humble turn of mind induces the frugal to appear
extravagant: and makes many a religious young fellow deny his principles, brave
his conſcience, and affect the character and converſation of an Atheiſt.
To ſay the truth, the generality of the gay world are arrant hypocrites in
their vices, and appear to be worſe than they really are. Many of our
pretended Bloods are, in fact, no more drunkards, whoremaſters, or infidels,
than a bully is a man of courage: and are as ſincere in their boaſts of
vice, as ſtateſmen or beauties in their mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of
friendship.</p>
               <p>THAT part of the female world, which compoſes the order of
Fine Ladies, have as much humility as their counterparts, the Fine Gentlemen.
There is ſomething ſo charming in the fair ſex that we ſhould almoſt
adore them, if they did not lay aſide all the pride of reputation, and by
ſome good-natured familiarities reduce themſelves to an equality with us.
It is indeed wonderful to ſee with what diligence our polite ladies pare off
the excellencies from their characters. When we ſee them almoſt as naked as
the <hi>Graces,</hi> it is natural to ſuppoſe them as warmly devoted to
<hi>Venus</hi>; and when we hear them talk looſely, and encourage double
meanings in converſation, we are apt to imagine their notions of honour not
very ſtrict <pb n="444" facs="tcp:1252700302:25"/> or ſevere. But after all this is
frequently mere hypocriſy, and the effect of humility. Many a lady very
wanton in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is in reality very modeſt; and many a coquet has
loſt her reputation, without loſing her virtue. I make no doubt but that
ſeveral ladies of ſuſpicious characters are not ſo bad as they ſeem,
and that there are honourable perſons among the gayeſt of our women of
quality.</p>
               <p>TO return whence I ſee ſet out, the extraordinary Modeſty
of the Moderns, ſo averſe to the arrogant pride of the Ancients claiming
all virtues and good qualities whatſoever, is the only key to their
behaviour. Thus vice, or at leaſt the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of vice, becomes
abſolutely requiſite to paſs through the world with tolerable decency,
and the character of a man of ſpirit. As Sir <hi>John Brute</hi> ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"they were ſneaking dogs, and afraid of being
damned in thoſe days,"</q> but we are better informed, and fear nothing but
the appearance of too much virtue. To ſecure the nobility, gentry, and others
from ſo ſhocking an imputation, I ſhall ſpeedily preſent the world
with a curious piece, compiled from the practice and principles of the
preſent times, entitled <hi>A New Treatiſe on Ethicks; or, a Syſtem of
Immoral Philoſophy.</hi> In this treatiſe I have treated at large of Modern
Modeſty, ſhewn the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and utility of Immorality, and conſidered
Drinking, Whoring, Fighting, and Gaming, as the four Cardinal Vices, or in
other words, the principal conſtituents of Bucks, Bloods and Fine
Gentlemen.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD-NATURE is to the mind, what beauty is to the body; and an
agreeable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition creates a love and eſteem for us in the reſt of
mankind, as an handſome perſon recommends us to the good graces of the
fair-ſex. To ſay the truth, any little defect in point of figure is
ſooner overlooked than a ſourneſs in the temper; and we conceive a more
laſting diſguſt at a moroſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of manners than at a
hump-back or a pair of bandy legs. Good-Nature is, indeed, ſo amiable a
qualification, that every man would be thought to poſſeſs it: and the
ladies themſelves would no more like to be accuſed of a perverſe turn of
mind than of an unhappy caſt of features. Hence it proceeds, that thoſe
unfortunate ſtale virgins, uſually call'd Old Maids, have both theſe
heavy cenſures <pb n="446" facs="tcp:1252700302:27"/> thrown upon them; and are at once
condemned, as ugly and ill-natured.</p>
               <p>SOME perſons are (according to the ſtrict import of the
phraſe itſelf) born Good-Natured. Theſe fortunate people are eaſy in
themſelves, and agreeable to all about them. They are, as it were,
conſtitutionally pleaſing, and can no more fail of being affable and
engaging in converſation, than a <hi>Hamilton</hi> or a <hi>Coventry</hi> can
be otherwiſe than beautiful and charming. Yet it is the duty even of theſe,
who are naturally endowed 
<q rend="inline">"with the ſoft parts of converſation."</q>
to be careful not to deprave or abuſe them. They muſt not rely too
confidently on their native agreeableneſs of temper: for we ſhould no more
eſteem a man, who diſcovered a negligence of pleaſing, than we ſhould
admire a beauty, who was an intolerable ſlattern. Nor on the other hand,
ſhould they let their Good-Nature run to an exceſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment and
extravagant civility: for an engaging temper has been as often ſpoiled by
this troubleſome politeneſs, as a fine ſhape has been ſqueezed into
frightful diſtortions by bad ſtays, and a fine complexion entirely ruined
by paint.</p>
               <p>BUT if this care is requiſite even in thoſe few, who are
bleſt with this native complacency and good humour, how neceſſary is it
for the generality of mankind to labour at rectifying the irregularities in
their temper. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it would be fully ſufficient, if they would
employ half the art to cultivate their minds, that is daily made uſe of to
ſet off their perſons. To this important end not only the female delicacies
of paint and eſſence are called in as auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries to the embroidered
ſuits and <hi>French</hi> perukes, but this anxiety to ſupply any
perſonal defect has ſet the invention of <pb n="447" facs="tcp:1252700302:28"/> artificers
to work with ſo much earneſtneſs, that there is ſcarce any external
blemiſh, which may not be removed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed: and however unkindly nature
may have dealt with you, you may by their aſſiſtance be made a model for
a ſtatuary, or a pattern for a painter to ſtudy. If you want an inch in
height, your ſhoemaker can ſupply it, and your hoſier can furniſh you
with a pair of calves that may put an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> to the bluſh. An
irregularity in your ſhape can be made inviſible by your taylor, or at
leaſt by the artiſt near the <hi>Hay-market,</hi> who daily gives notice,
that he makes ſteel ſtays for all thoſe who are INCLINED <hi>to be
crooked.</hi> There are various compounds and coſmetics that will cure
ſpots and freckles in the complexion, and combs and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that will
change red hair to the fineſt brown. Do you want an eye? <hi>Taylor</hi> will
fill the vacant ſocket with as bright a piercer as the family of the
<hi>Pentweazles</hi> can boaſt: or is your mouth <hi>deficient</hi> for want
of teeth, <hi>Paul Jullion</hi> (to uſe his own phraſe) will <hi>rectify
your head,</hi> and fix a ſet in your gums as even and beautiful as ever
adorned the mouth of a chimney-ſweeper. Theſe and many other inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as
curious and extraordinary have been deviſed; and there are no operations,
however painful, which have not been ſubmitted to with patience to conquer
perſonal defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. I know a gentleman who went through the agony of
having his leg broke a ſecond time, becauſe it had been ſet awry; and I
remember a lady, who died of a cancer in her breaſt, occaſioned by the
application of repelling plaiſters to keep back her milk, that the beauty of
her neck might not be deſtroyed. I moſt heartily wiſh the ſame
resolution was diſcovered in improving the diſpoſition. Half the care
that is taken of the body would have happy effects upon the 
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:1252700302:29"/> temper. <hi>Tully</hi> in that part of his
<hi>Offices,</hi> where he ſpeaks of Grace, tells us, 
<q rend="inline">"that it is deſtroyed by any violent
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations either of the body or mind."</q> It is a pity that mankind
cannot be reconciled to this opinion; ſince it is likely, they would ſpare
no pains in cultivating their minds if it tended to adorn their perſons. Yet
it is certain that a man makes a worſe figure with an ignorant pate than an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powdered peruke, and that knowledge is a greater ornament to the head than a
bag or a ſmart cocked hat; that anger ſets like a blood-ſhot in the eyes,
while good-nature lights them up with ſmiles, and makes every feature in the
face charming and agreeable. There is a certain ſweetneſs of
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is ſure to procure to thoſe who poſſeſs it
the good-will of their acquaintance; but it is as ridiculous for a man to hope
to be beloved, while he neglects to be amiable, as it would be in a lady, who
expects a multitude of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to appear always in a dirty diſhabille.</p>
               <p>THE difficulty of being convinced that we want this ſocial
turn, is the grand reaſon that ſo little pains are taken to acquire and
perfect it. Would a man once be perſuaded of any irregularity in his temper,
he would find the blemiſhes of the mind more eaſily corrected and amended
than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and deformities of the body; but alas! every man is in his
own opinion ſenſible and good-humour'd. It is, indeed, poſſible to
convince us, that we have a bad complexion or an aukward deportment, which we
endeavour to amend by waſhes and a dancing-maſter; but when the mind is in
fault, ſelf-adulation, the moſt fatal ſpecies of flattery, makes us
cajole ourſelves into a belief, that the fault is not in our own
diſpoſition, but in that of our companions: as the mad <pb n="449" facs="tcp:1252700302:30"/> inhabitants of <hi>Moor-fields</hi> conclude all, that come to
viſit them, out of their ſenſes. A whimſical perſon complains of the
perverſeneſs of his acquaintance, and conſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes them of fancy
and caprice: and there never was an inſtance of a poſitive untoward man,
that did not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rail at the ſtubbornneſs and obſtinacy of the
reſt of the world. A modern Buck damns you for a ſullen fellow, if you
refuſe a pint bumper, and looks upon you as a ſneaking ſcoundrel if you
decline entering into any of his wild pranks, and do not chuſe to lay all
night in the round-houſe. It was the ſaying of an old philoſopher, that 
<q rend="inline">"the eye ſees not itſelf:"</q> but when this
blind partiality is carried ſo far, as to make us think thoſe guilty of the
folly who make us ſenſible of it, it is ſurely as abſurd as to imagine,
that the hair-lip or carbuncled noſe, a man ſees in the glaſs, belongs to
the figure in the mirror, and not to his own face. This fooliſh flattery it
is, that makes us think ourſelves inflexibly right, while we are
obſtinately wrong, and prevents our receiving or communicating, any
pleaſure in ſociety. The untractable humouriſt, while he diſguſts all
that are about him, conceives himſelf to be the perſon affronted, and
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that there is no harmony in the converſation, though he is himſelf
the only one out of tune.</p>
               <p>PERFECTION is no more to be expected in the minds of men than in
their perſons: Natural defects and irregularities in both muſt be
overlooked and excuſed. All I deſire at preſent is, that they would
endeavour with equal earneſtneſs to cultivate their minds, as they do to
adorn their perſons. To this end we ſhould examine ourſelves impartially,
and not erect ourſelves into judges, and treat all the reſt; of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
like criminals. Would it not be mighty ridiculous in <pb n="450" facs="tcp:1252700302:31"/> a
perſon of quality to go to court in a ruff, a cloak, a pair of trunk
breeches, and the habit worn in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and while
he ſtrutted about in this antiquated garb, to accuſe all the reſt of the
world of being out of the faſhion? As we are compoſed of a body and mind,
equal attention ſhould be paid to both; and we ſhould not be anxious to
cloath the perſon, and at the ſame time let the mind go naked. We ſhould
be equally aſſiduous to obtain knowledge and virtue as to put on lace and
velvet: and when our minds are completely dreſſed, we ſhould take care
that good-nature and complacency influence and direct the whole; which will
throw the ſame grace over our virtues and good qualities, as fine cloaths
receive from being cut according to the faſhion.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT conclude better than with a paſſage from
<hi>Swift</hi>'s <hi>Tale of a Tub,</hi> where the ſtrict analogy between the
cloathing of the mind and the body is humourouſly pointed out. 
<q rend="inline">"Man (ſays he) is a <hi>Micro-coat.</hi> As to
his body there can be no doubt; but examine even the acquirements of his mind,
you will find them all contribute in their order towards furniſhing out an
exact dreſs. To inſtance no more; is not <hi>religion</hi> a cloak,
<hi>honeſty</hi> a pair of ſhoes worn out in the dirt, <hi>ſelf-love</hi>
a ſurtout, <hi>vanity</hi> a ſhirt, and <hi>conſcience</hi> a pair of
breeches, which though a cover for lewdneſs as well as naſtineſs, is
eaſily ſlipt down for the ſervice of both."</q>

incident at one of our late privy councils. Sir <hi>Politic</hi>'s nephew, who,
it ſeems, has made as great a proficiency in the ſtudy of the Humbug as of
the law, ſent him down, as a ſerious prophecy, a new pamphlet humourouſly
foretelling the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
This the unſuſpicious Baronet read very gravely over, and then turning to
the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"Rare news, doctor!—Come fill a bumper
to <hi>Old England</hi>—We have the bible of our ſide, you ſee, and
hark ye, Doctor, I'd adviſe you as a friend to preach a ſermon upon
<hi>Thou ſhalt be deſolate,</hi> O MOUNT SEIR!"</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>NOTHING at firſt puzzled the honeſt baronet, and the
reſt of our country politicians ſo much as the new ſeat of war. They were
pretty tollerably acquainted with <hi>Bruſſels, Ghent, Antwerp,</hi> and
the other ſcenes of action in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but <hi>Virginia,</hi> the
<hi>Ohio,</hi> the Lake <hi>Ontario,</hi> &amp;c. (to uſe a common phraſe)
were quite out of their latitude. This <pb n="455" facs="tcp:1252700302:36"/> difficulty was
however at length ſurmounted by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar's tranſmitting to his uncle
one of <hi>D' Anville</hi>'s maps, which has enabled the baronet ſometimes to
delineate the progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> up the <hi>Ohio</hi> in
meanders of port winding along the table, and ſometimes to demoliſh the
forts lately raiſed by the enemy behind <hi>Penſylvania</hi> and at
<hi>Crown Point.</hi> Sir <hi>Politic</hi> has indeed ſtudied Monſieur
<hi>D' Anville</hi> very thoroughly, and I dare ſay is better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his plan of <hi>North America,</hi> than with the map of his own
eſtate.</p>
                     <p>WAR never fails of producing ſeveral groundleſs and
contradictory reports; but if Fame is a lying jade in town, ſhe is the
idleſt goſſip that ever ſpoke in the country. It is impoſſible for
you, Couſin, or any of your readers, who reſide conſtantly in
<hi>London,</hi> to form any tolerable idea of a country news-paper. There is
in this town a petty printer who ſets his preſs to work once a week by
publiſhing a journal, which contains advices more extraordinary, if not
authentic, than the gazette. It has been his cuſtom for ſome years paſt
to raiſe apparitions in country churches, to give accounts of battles fought
in the air, comets, and ſeveral other preternatural phoenomena: but ſince
the rumour of a war, he has dealt in nothing but ſkirmiſhes and
engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He gave the <hi>French</hi> fleet ſeveral furious broadſides
before it ſailed from <hi>Breſt,</hi> and has gained us ſeveral
vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in <hi>Virginia</hi>; though in his laſt journal he ſhot off
both <hi>Boſcawen</hi>'s legs, and made him fight, like
<hi>Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> on his ſtumps; and it was but yeſterday that Sir
<hi>Politic,</hi> on the authority of a letter from his nephew, confuted this
intelligence, and ſet the Admiral on his legs again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="456" facs="tcp:1252700302:37"/>THIS, Couſin, is the preſent ſtate
of politics at —, which I think, in the ſtile of our news-papers, might
cauſe you much ſpeculation. You would be of great ſervice, if you could
perſuade our country ſtateſmen that they would be better employed at
their ruſtic occupations than in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the affairs of the nation, and
that many a man would make a ſcurvy figure at the helm of the ſtate, who is
of great uſe at the plough-tail. As to my friend Sir <hi>Politic,</hi> I
ſhould be very glad if he would leave the conduct of the war, and the
deſtination of our fleets and armies to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, who will, I doubt
not, adjuſt matters as prudently as himſelf, the curate, and apothecary:
and I think his thoughts might be more properly exerciſed in contriving
ſome method of redeeming two heavy mortgages that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber his eſtate,
than in laying plans for the diſcharge of the national debt.</p>

                        <salute>SIR!</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> READ your late paper, ſhewing the cloſe analogy which
cloathing the body bears to adorning the mind, with great attention: and am
thoroughly perſuaded, that the generality of mankind would be as glad to
embelliſh their minds as to ſet off their perſons, if they could procure
knowledge, virtue, and good-nature, with the ſame eaſe that they can
furniſh themſelves with the ornaments of the body. The clown in rug or
duffel can, at a moment's warning, be furniſhed with a complete ſuit of
lace or embroidery <pb n="458" facs="tcp:1252700302:39"/> from <hi>Monmouth-ſtreet</hi>: his
long lank greaſy hair may be exchanged in <hi>Middle Row</hi> for a ſmart
bag or a jemmy ſcratch; and his clouted ſhoes, with the rough hobnails in
the heel and ſole clumping at every ſtep, may be transformed into a pair of
dancing pumps at the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Warehouſe, or the <hi>Old
Criſpin</hi> in <hi>Cranbourn Alley.</hi> The draggled ſtreet walker can
rig herſelf with a clean ſmock, a linen gown, and a hat ſmartly cocked up
behind and before, in <hi>Broad St. Giles</hi>'s; or if ſhe can afford it,
every pawn-broker will let out a gold watch with coronets, a tiſſue or
brocaded ſack, and all the <hi>paraphernalia</hi> of a counteſs. But where,
Mr. TOWN, can theſe people go to cloath their minds, or at what ſhops are
retailed ſenſe and virtue? Honour and honeſty are not to be purchaſed
in <hi>Monmouth-ſtreet</hi>: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not infuſed into the head
through the powder-puff; and, as good wine needs no buſh, ſenſe is not
derived from the full-bottomed periwig. The woman of the town, vamped up for
ſhow with paint, patches, plumpers, and every external ornament that art can
ſuggeſt, knows no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to beautify her mind. She cannot for any price
buy chaſtity in <hi>Broad St. Giles</hi>'s, or hire honeſty from the
pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broker's.</p>
                     <p>SEEING therefore at one view the difficulty in obtaining the
accompliſhments of the mind, and the exact analogy they bear to dreſs, I
have been labouring this week paſt to remedy that inconvenience, and have at
length deviſed a ſcheme which will fully anſwer that purpoſe. In a word
then, I ſhall next winter open a ſhop or warehouſe in the moſt public
part of the town, under the name of a MIND-AND BODY-CLOTHIER: two trades which,
though never yet united, are ſo far from being incompatible, that they are in
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:1252700302:40"/> their nature inſeparable. I ſhall not only ſupply
my friends with a ſuit or a ſingle virtue, but furniſh them with
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete habits of mind and body from head to foot: and by a certain ſecret
art in the form and texture of the things ſold, the required virtues ſhall
be as inherent in them, as the materials of which they are compoſed. That
ſuch virtues may be transfuſed by cloaths is evident from experience. In
the narrow extent of my reading, Mr. TOWN, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have met with an
account of <hi>Fortunatus</hi>'s <hi>Wiſhing-Cap,</hi> by which he could
tranſport himſelf in an inſtant from one place to another: It is alſo
well known, that the famous <hi>Jack</hi> the Giant-killer poſſeſſed a
ſword of ſharpneſs, ſhoes of ſwiftneſs, and a coat of
inviſibility. Why then may not I ſell a ſuit of patriotiſm, a ſword
of honour, and retail modeſty and chaſtity to fine ladies in tuckers and
aprons. My ſcheme is already in great forwardneſs; and I ſhall be able to
accommodate my cuſtomers by the next birth-day: wherefore, as Meſſieurs
<hi>Paris</hi> and others daily advertiſe in the news-papers, I alſo
chuſe to give the world public notice of my ſcheme, and ſhall be proud to
ſee them firſt appriſed of it by means of your paper.</p>
                     <p>NO one, who duly conſiders the natural influence, which
cloaths commonly have upon their wearers, will object to my ſcheme as utterly
impracticable. That a perſon can put on or throw off the internal habits of
his mind together with his coat or his perriwig, is plain in very numerous
inſtances. The young counſellor, who every morning in term time takes the
meaſure of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> with the importance of a judge upon
the circuit, at once diveſts himſelf of his gravity with the ſtarched
band and long robe, and reſumes the ſpirit of a buck together with the 
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:1252700302:41"/> ſword and bag-wig. In the ſame manner the orthodox
vicar once a week wraps himſelf up in piety and virtue with his canonicals;
which qualities are as eaſily caſt off again as his ſurplice; and for the
reſt of the week he wears the dreſs as well as the manners of his
fox-hunting patron. We may learn the diſpoſition of a man by his apparel,
as we know the trade of a carpenter by his leathern apron, or a ſoldier by
his red coat. When we ſee a ſnuff-coloured ſuit of <hi>ditto</hi> with
the bolus buttons, a metal headed cane, and an enormous buſhy grizzle, we as
readily know the wearer to be a diſpenſer of life and death, as if we had
ſeen him pounding a mortar or brandiſhing a clyſter-pipe. The different
affections of the mind have been diſtinguiſhed by different colours; as
ſcarlet has been made to repreſent valour, yellow to denote jealouſy, and
true blue to ſignify integrity: but we may likewiſe diſcover all the
virtues and vices lurking in the different parts of the apparel. When at a city
feaſt I ſee the gueſts tucking their napkins into their ſhirt-collars,
as if they were all of them going to be ſhaved, I very well know that their
thoughts wear a different dreſs than in the Alley: and when the antiquated
toaſt is laying on her complexion at the toilette, and repairing the ruins of
beauty, what is ſhe doing but patching her mind with pride and conceit? In a
word, I can diſcover impudence ſtaring from the bold cock of a
<hi>Kevenhuller,</hi> frugality ſkulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a darned ſtocking, coquetry
ſpread out in a hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petticoat, and ſoppery dangling from a
ſhoulder-knot. I often pleaſe myſelf with thus remarking the various
dreſſes of the mind; and by the clue you have already given us I have been
able to unfold the inmoſt linings of the heart, and diſcover 
<q rend="inline">"the very ſtuff of the thoughts."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="461" facs="tcp:1252700302:42"/>IT muſt, however, be owned, that in
theſe matters the niceſt penetration may be impoſed on; ſince in the
preſent random method of dreſſing, many perſons appear in
maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade. This inconvenience, among many others, will be remedied by my
project; for, as whoever deals with me will at once cloath his mind and his
body, the whole town will be dreſſed in character. Thus if a
chimney-ſweeper or a plough-boy put on a ſuit of embroidery, a ſword,
bag-wig, &amp;c. they will at the ſame time inveſt themſelves with the
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dignity of a perſon of quality: my lady's youngeſt ſon may buy
courage with his regimentals, and orthodoxy may be purchaſed at the ſame
time with a gown and caſſock by the young ſmarts from the univerſities.
My ſcheme alſo further recommends itſelf, by laying open the only path to
virtue and knowledge, that the world will chuſe to follow: and as my cloaths
will always be cut according to the neweſt and moſt elegant manner, theſe
qualifications of the mind, inherent in them, muſt neceſſarily come into
faſhion. Thus our fine gentlemen will learn morality under their valet de
chambre; and a young lady of faſhion will acquire new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments with
every new ribband, and become virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as well as beautiful at her toilette. I
depend on your readineſs to promote my ſcheme; but what I moſt
earneſtly intreat of you, Mr. TOWN, is to uſe your utmoſt intereſt with
the polite world, but eſpecially with the ladies, not to diſcard cloaths
entirely; as by ſuch a reſolution my ſcheme muſt be defeated: and
indeed it will not be in the power of man to give them virtue, if they
determine to go naked.</p>
                     <p>AS knowledge and virtue can never be ſufficiently
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, my warehouſe will be calculated for general uſe, and ſtored
with large aſſortments of all kinds of virtues and dreſſes, that I may
ſuit perſons of whatever denomination. Phyſicians may be furniſhed from
my ſhop with gravity and learning in the tyes of a perriwig; ſerjeants at
law may be fitted with a competent knowledge of reports under a coif; 
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:1252700302:43"/> and young counſellors may be endued with a ſufficient
fund of eloquence for the circuits, in a ſmart tye between a bob and a flow,
contrived to cover a toupee. I ſhall ſell religion to country parſons in
pudding-ſleeves, and to young town curates juſt come from the univerſity,
in doctors ſcarfs and cut grizzles: I ſhall have ſome pious ejaculations,
whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and groans, ready cut out in leathern aprons and blue frocks, for
the preaching fraternity of carpenters, brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, tallow-chandlers, and
butchers, at the Tabernacle and Foundery in <hi>Moor-fields.</hi> For our
military gentlemen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to go abroad, I ſhall have ſeveral parcels
of true <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> courage woven in a variety of cockades and
ſword-knots: and for our fine gentlemen, who ſtay at home, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a proper quantity of <hi>French Bagatelle,</hi> in cut velvet, lace and
embroidery, neat as imported.</p>
                     <p>AS the ladies, I ſuppoſe, will all of them to a woman be
deſirous of purchaſing beauty with every branch of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male apparel, I
am afraid I ſhall not be able to anſwer their demands: but I ſhall have
ſeveral dreſſes, which will make up for the want of it. I ſhall have
neatneſs done up in a great variety of plain linnen; decency and diſcretion
in ſeveral patterns for mobs, hoods, and nightgowns; together with modeſty
diſpoſed into tuckers, kerchiefs for the neck, ſtays that almoſt meet
the chin, and petticoats that touch the ground. I ſhall alſo have a ſmall
portion of chaſtity knit into garters, and laces for the ſtays, very proper
to be worn at maſquerades and aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>I HAD almoſt forgot to mention, that authors, who are often
in equal want of ſenſe and cloaths, ſhall be fitted out by me with both
at once on very reaſonable rates. As for yourſelf, Mr. TOWN, I ſhall beg
leave to preſent you with an entire ſuit of ſuperfine wit and humour,
warranted to wear well, and appear creditable, and in which no author would be
aſhamed to be ſeen.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OTHING appears to me to be more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to
wear off any particularities in our behaviour, or to root out any
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs in our opinions, than mixing with perſons of ages and
occupations different from our own. Whoſoever confines himſelf entirely to
the ſociety of thoſe who are engaged in the ſame perſuits, 
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:1252700302:45"/> and whoſe thoughts naturally take the ſame turn with
his own, acquires a certain ſtiffneſs and pedantry of behaviour, which is
ſure; to make him diſagreeable, except in one particular ſet of company.
Inſtead of cramping the mind by keeping it within ſo narrow a circle, we
ſhould endeavour to enlarge it by every worthy notion and accompliſhment;
and temper each qualification with its oppoſite, as the four elements are
compounded in our natural frame.</p>
                     <p>THE neceſſity of this free converſation, to open and
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the mind, is evident from the conſequences, which always follow a
neglect of it. The employment each man follows, wholly engroſſes his
attention, and tinges the mind with a peculiar die, which ſhews itſelf in
all the operations of it, unleſs prevented by natural good ſenſe and
liberal education. The phyſician, the lawyer, and the tradeſman will appear
in company, though none of thoſe occupations are the ſubject of
diſcourſe; and the clergyman will grow moroſe and ſevere, who ſeldom
or never converſes with the laity. But if no particular profeſſion has
this influence over us, ſome darling paſſion or amuſement gives a
colour to our thoughts and actions, and makes us odious, or at leaſt
ridiculous. Fine ladies for inſtance, by deſpiſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of
ſenſible men, can talk of nothing but routes, balls, aſſemblies,
birth-day ſuits, and intrigues; and fine gentlemen, for the ſame reaſon,
of almoſt nothing at all. In like manner, the furious partizan, who has not
been weaned from a mad attachment to particular principles, is weak enough to
imagine every man of a different way of thinking a fool and a ſcoundrel; and
the ſectary or zealot devotes to eternal damnation all thoſe, who will not
go to heaven in the ſame road with himſelf, under the guidance 
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:1252700302:46"/> of <hi>Whitefield, Weſley,</hi> or <hi>Count
Zinzendorff.</hi> To the ſame cauſe we owe the rough country ſquire,
whoſe ideas are wholly bent on guns, dogs, horſes, and game; and who has
every thing about him of a piece with his diverſions. His hall muſt be
adorned with ſtags heads inſtead of buſts and ſtatues, and in the room
of family pictures, you will ſee prints of the moſt famous ſtallions and
race-horſes: all his doors open and ſhut with foxes feet, and even the
buttons of his cloaths are impreſſed with the figures of dogs, foxes,
ſtags, and horſes. To this abſurd practice of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating only one ſet
of ideas, and ſhutting ourſelves out from any intercourſe with the reſt
of the world, is owing that narrowneſs of mind which has infected the
converſations of the polite world with inſipidity, made roughneſs and
bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the characteriſtics of a mere country gentleman, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the
moſt fatal conſequences in politics and religion.</p>
                     <p>BUT if this commerce with the generality of mankind is ſo
neceſſary to remove any impreſſions, which we may be liable to receive
from any particular employment or darling amuſement, what precautions ought
to be uſed, in order to remedy the inconveniences naturally brought on us by
the different ages of life! It is not certain that a perſon will be engaged
in any profeſſion, or given up to any peculiar kind of pleaſure, but the
mind of every man is ſubject to the inclinations ariſing from the ſeveral
ſtages of his exiſtence, as well as his body to chronical diſtempers.
This indeed, Mr. TOWN, is the principal cauſe of my writing to you, for it
has often given me great concern to ſee the preſent diviſion between the
young and the old; to obſerve elderly men forming themſelves into clubs and
ſocieties, that they may be more ſecurely ſeparated from youth; and to
ſee <pb n="466" facs="tcp:1252700302:47"/> young men running into diſſipation and
debauchery, rather than aſſociate with age. If each party would labour to
conform to the other, from ſuch a coalition many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would accrue to
both. Our youth would be inſtructed by the experience of age, and loſe much
of that ſeverity, which they retain too long: while at the ſame time the
wrinkled brow of the aged would be ſmoothed by the ſprightly chearfulneſs
of youth; by which they might ſupply the want of ſpirits, forget the loſs
of old friends, and bear with eaſe all their worldly misfortunes. It is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that thoſe young men are the moſt worthy and ſenſible, who
have kept up any intercourſe with the old; and that thoſe old men are of
the moſt chearful and amiable diſpoſition, who have not been aſhamed to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the young.</p>
                     <p>I WILL not pretend to decide which party is moſt blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in neglecting this neceſſary commerce between each other, which, if
properly managed, would be at once ſo beneficial and delightful: but it
undoubtedly ariſes from a certain ſelfiſhneſs and obſtinacy in both,
which will not ſuffer them to make a mutual allowance for the natural
difference of their diſpoſitions. Their inclinations are indeed as
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as their years; yet each expects the other to comply, though neither
will make any advances. How rarely do we ſee the leaſt degree of ſociety
preſerved between a father and ſon! a ſhocking reflection, when we
conſider that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has endeavoured to unite them by parental affection on
one ſide, and filial gratitude on the other. Yet a father and ſon as
ſeldom live together with any tolerable harmony as a huſband and wife; and
chiefly for the ſame reaſon: for though they are both joined under the
ſame yoke, yet they <pb n="467" facs="tcp:1252700302:48"/> are each tugging different ways. A
father might as well expect his ſon to be as gouty and infirm as himſelf,
as to have the diſpoſition which he has contracted from age: and a ſon
might as reaſonably deſire the vigour and vivacity of five and twenty, as
his own love of gaiety and diverſions in his father. It is therefore plainly
evident, that a mutual endeavour of conforming to each other is abſolutely
requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to keep together the cement of natural affection, which the want
of it ſo frequently diſſolves: or at at leaſt, if it does not diſturb
the affection, it conſtantly deſtroys the ſociety between father and
ſon.</p>
                     <p>THIS unhappy and unnatural diviſion is often the ſubject
of complaint in perſons of both ages, but is ſtill unremedied becauſe
they neither reflect on the cauſe whence it proceeds. Old men are perpetually
commenting on the extreme levity of the times, and blaming the young, becauſe
they do not admire and court their company: which indeed is no wonder, ſince
they generally treat their youthful companions as mere children, and expect
ſuch a ſlaviſh deference to their years, as deſtoys that equality by
which chearfulneſs and ſociety ſubſiſts. Young men do not like to be
chid by an ill-natur'd proverb, or reproved by a wrinkle: but though they do
not chuſe to be corrected by their grave ſeniors, like ſchool-boys, they
would be proud to conſult them as friends; which the injudicious ſeverity
of old age ſeldom will permit, not deigning to indulge them with ſo great a
degree of freedom and familiarity. Youth, on the other hand, ſhun the company
of age, complaining of the ſmall regard and reſpect paid to them, though
they often act with ſo little reſerve and ſuch unbecoming confidence as
not to deſerve it. Suppoſe the old were pleaſed with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral 
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:1252700302:49"/> flow of ſpirits and lively converſation of youth,
ſtill ſome reſpect may be challenged as due to them: nor ſhould the
decency and ſobriety of their characters ever be inſulted by any improper
or immodeſt converſation.</p>
                     <p>I AM an old man myſelf, Mr. TOWN, and I have an only boy,
whoſe behaviour to me is unexceptionable: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me therefore to dwell a
moment longer on my favourite ſubject, and I will conclude. With what harmony
might all parents and children live together, if the father would ſtrive to
ſoften the rigour of age, and remember that his ſon muſt naturally
poſſeſs thoſe qualities, which ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company youth; and if the ſon
would in return endeavour to ſuit himſelf to thoſe infirmities which his
Father received from old age! If they would reciprocally ſtudy to be
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to each other, the father would inſenſibly ſubſtitute
affection in the room of authority, and loſe the churliſh ſeverity and
peeviſhneſs incident to his years: while the ſon would curb the
unbecoming impetuoſity of his youth, change his reluctance to obey into a
conſtant attention to pleaſe, and remit much of his extreme gaiety in
conformity to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of his father. Wherever ſuch a turn of mind is
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged there muſt be happineſs and agreeable ſociety; and the
contrary qualities of youth and age, thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, compoſe the ſureſt
cement of affection, as colours of the moſt oppoſite tints by a ſkilful
mixture, each giving and receiving certain ſhades, will form a picture, the
moſt heightened and exquiſite in it's colouring.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE been very much diverted with your obſervations on
our honeſt tradeſmen, who make weekly excurſions into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
villages; and I agree with you, that the generality of our citizens ſeldom
dare truſt themſelves out of the ſight of <hi>London</hi> ſmoke, or
extend their travels further than with their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the
<hi>Wandſworth</hi> double poſt-chaiſe, or the <hi>Hampton</hi> long
coach. But we may now and then pick up a ſtray citizen, whom buſineſs has
dragged beyond the bills of <pb n="470" facs="tcp:1252700302:51"/> mortality, as it happened to
myſelf the other day about twenty miles from <hi>London:</hi> and as I was
mightily pleaſed with his behaviour and converſation, I have taken the
liberty to ſend you an account of it.</p>
                     <p>BEING caught in a ſhower upon the road, I was glad to take
ſhelter at the firſt inn I came to; which, if it had been called the NEW
INN, I ſhould have thought, from its antique appearance, that it had been an
houſe of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the time of our great grandfathers. I had ſcarce
alighted, when a ſtrange figure (driven thither, as I ſuppoſed, on the
ſame account with myſelf,) came ſoberly jogging into the yard, dripping
wet. As he waited for the ſteps, before he would venture to get off his
horſe, I had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſurveying his whole appearance. He was
wrapped up in an old thread-bare weather-beaten ſurtout, which I believe had
once been ſcarlet; the cape was pulled over his head, and buttoned up cloſe
round his face; and his hat was flapped down on each ſide, and faſtened
about his ears with a liſt garter tyed under his chin. He wore upon his legs
ſomething that reſembled ſplatterdaſhes, which (as I afterwards
learned) were cut out of an old pair of boots; but his right ſhoe was
conſiderably larger than the other, and had ſeveral ſlits in the upper
leather. He had ſpurs on, indeed, but without rowels; and by way of whip a
worm-eaten cane, with a bone head ſtudded with braſs pins, hung from his
wriſt by a ſtring of greaſy black leather.</p>
                     <p>I SOON found I was nobody: for the GENTLEMAN, it ſeems, took
up the whole attention of the maid, miſtreſs, and oſtler, who all of them
got round him, and with much difficulty, by the aſſiſtance of the
ſteps, helped him down. <pb n="471" facs="tcp:1252700302:52"/> My landlady, (after the uſual
welcome) before it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for her to ſee any part of him but his
noſe, told him 
<q rend="inline">"he looked brave and jolly;"</q> and when
ſhe had led him into the kitchen, ſhe fetched a large glaſs of what ſhe
called 
<q rend="inline">"her own water,"</q> which (ſhe ſaid)
would keep the cold out of his ſtomach. All hands were now buſied in
drawing off his ſurtout, which diſcovered underneath a full-trimmed white
coat, and a black velvet waiſtcoat with a broad gold lace very much
tarniſhed. The ſurtout was hung to dry by the fire as well as his coat, the
place of which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by a long riding-hood of my landlady; and as the
gentleman complained of having ſuffered by a loſs of leather, the maid was
diſpatched to the doctor's for ſome <hi>diachylon.</hi> The uſual
queſtion now ſucceeded, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dinner; and as he obſerved I was all
alone, he very courteouſly offered me to join company, which I as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
accepted.</p>
                     <p>THE important buſineſs of dinner being ſettled, we
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed into a private room; when my fellow-gueſt told me of his own
accord, that he lived in <hi>London</hi>; that for theſe twenty years he had
always come to the town we were now in, once a year, to receive money, and take
orders for goods; and that he had always put up at this houſe. He then run on
in the praiſes of the landlady; and tipping me a wink, 
<q rend="inline">"ay, ſays he, ſhe has been a clever woman
in her time, before ſhe bore children."</q> He added, that for his part he
did not like your great inns; for that they never looked upon any thing under a
coach and ſix. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther informed me, that he was married to his preſent
wife in the firſt mayoralty of Alderman <hi>Parſons,</hi> and in the very
waiſtcoat he had on: 
<q rend="inline">"but, ſays he, I now wear it only 
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:1252700302:53"/> on a journey; becauſe, you know, a bit of lace
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands reſpect upon the road."</q> Upon enquiring about his family, I
found he had three boys; one of whom was bound prentice to himſelf; the other
was ſent to ſea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a wild one; and the third he deſigned
to make a parſon of, becauſe he was grave, and his play-fellows at
<hi>Poule</hi>'s ſchool uſed to call him 
<q rend="inline">"biſhop."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>ALL this while he had ſat in my landlady's riding-hood, with
a linen nightcap on his head tyed on the top with a piece of black ribband,
which (he told me) he always rode in, becauſe it was cooler than a wig. But
the ſaddle-bags were now ordered in; and out of one of them he drew a large
flowing grizzle carefully buckled, which he combed out himſelf, borrowing
ſome flour from the kitchen drudger. His ſplatterdaſhes were next taken
off, his ſhoes wiped with a wiſp of hay; and being aſſured by the
landlady herſelf, that his coat was dry enough to put on, he completely
equipped himſelf, in order to wait on ſeveral tradeſmen, with whom he had
dealings, after dinner. As this was not quite ready, we took a walk to the
ſtables to ſee his mare: and though the beaſt ſeemed as lean and
harmleſs as <hi>Sancho</hi>'s aſs, he aſſured me he had much ado to
ride her, ſhe was ſo friſky; 
<q rend="inline">"for ſhe had not run in the chaiſe theſe
two ſundays paſt."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>BEING ſummoned in to dinner, we ſat down to a repaſt of
mutton chops and ſheeps hearts, which laſt he declared to be the
wholſomeſt eating in the world. He objected to wine, becauſe there was
not a drop good for any thing to be got upon the road; but he vaſtly
recommended my landlady's home-brewed, which he affirmed to be better 
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:1252700302:54"/> than <hi>Hogſden</hi> ale, or the thatch beer at
<hi>Iſlington.</hi> Our meal being ended, my companion took his pipe; and we
laid our heads together for the good of the nation, when we mauled the
<hi>French</hi> terribly both by land and ſea. At laſt, among other talk,
he happened to aſk me, if I lived in the City? As I was deſirous of hearing
his remarks, I anſwered, that I had never ſeen <hi>London.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Never ſeen it? (ſays he) Then you have
never ſeen one of the fineſt ſights in the whole world. <hi>Paris</hi> is
but a dog-hole to it."</q> There luckily hung a large Map of <hi>London</hi>
over the chimney-piece, which he immediately made me get from my chair to look
at. 
<q rend="inline">"There, ſays he, there's <hi>London</hi> for
you.—You ſee it is bigger than the Map of all <hi>England.</hi>
                        </q> He
then led me about, with the end of his pipe, through all the principal
ſtreets from <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> to <hi>White-Chapel.</hi>— 
<q rend="inline">"That, ſays he, is the River
<hi>Thames</hi>;—There's <hi>London</hi> Bridge—There my Lord Mayor
lives—That's <hi>Poule</hi>'s—There the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument</hi>
ſtands: And now, if you was but on the top of it, you might ſee all the
houſes and churches in <hi>London.</hi>"</q> I expreſſed my
aſtoniſhment at every particular: but I could hardly refrain laughing, when
pointing out to me <hi>Lincoln's Inn Fields</hi>— 
<q rend="inline">"There, ſaid he, there all the noblemen
live."</q> At laſt, after having tranſported me all over the town, he ſet
me down in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"which (he ſaid) was the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſtreet
in the City."—</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"And now, ſays he, I'll ſhow you where I
live.—</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"That's <hi>Bow-Church</hi>—and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts—where my pipe is—there—juſt there my ſhop
ſtands."</q> He concluded with a kind invitation to me to come and ſee him;
and pulling out a book of patterns from his coat-pocket, aſſured me, that
if I wanted any thing in his way, he could afford to let me have a bargain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="474" facs="tcp:1252700302:55"/>I PROMISED to call upon him; and the
weather now clearing up, after ſettling the ballance of our reckoning with
the landlady, we took leave of each other: but juſt as I had mounted my
horſe, and was going to ſet forward, my new acquaintance came up to me, and
ſhaking me by the hand,— 
<q rend="inline">"Hearkye, ſays he, if you will be in town by
the twenty fifth of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> I will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to the
<hi>Cockney's Feaſt</hi>; where, I aſſure you, you'll be mighty merry,
and hear a great many good ſongs."</q>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F polygamy was allowed in this country, I am ſure I might
maintain a ſeraglio of wives at leſs expence than I have brought upon
myſelf by marrying one woman. One did I ſay? Alas! I find it to my coſt,
that a wife, like a polypus, has the power of dividing and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
herſelf into as many bodies as ſhe pleaſes. You muſt know, Mr. TOWN, I
took a woman of ſmall fortune and made her my own fleſh and blood: but I
never thought that all her relations would likewiſe faſten on me with as
little ceremony as a colony of fleas. I had ſcarce brought 
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:1252700302:57"/> her home, before I was obliged to marry her mother: then
I was prevailed on to marry her two maiden ſiſters; after that I married
her aunts; then her couſins—In ſhort, I am now married to the whole
generation of them. I do not exaggerate matters, when I ſay that I am married
to them all: for they claim as much right to every thing that is mine, as the
perſon whom the world calls my wife. They eat, drink, and ſleep with me:
Every room in my houſe is at their command, except my bedchamber: They
bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row money of me:—and ſince I have the whole family quartered upon
me, what ſignifies which of them takes upon her my name,—my wife, her
ſiſter, or her twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth couſin?</p>
                     <p>O Mr. TOWN! I never ſit down to table without the lamentable
proſpect of ſeeing as much victuals conſumed, as would dine a whole
veſtry. So many mouths conſtantly going at my expence! And then there is
ſuch variety of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions! for couſin <hi>Biddy</hi> likes one diſh;
my aunt <hi>Rachel</hi> is fond of another; ſiſter <hi>Molly</hi> cannot
abide this; and mother could never touch that:—though I find they are all
of them unanimous in liking the beſt of every thing in ſeaſon. Beſides,
I could entertain a ſet of jolly topers at a leſs rate than it coſts me
in light wines for the women. One of them drinks nothing but <hi>Liſbon</hi>;
with another nothing goes down but <hi>Rheniſh</hi> and <hi>Spa</hi>; a third
ſwallows me an ocean of <hi>Briſtol Milk,</hi> with as little remorſe as
ſhe would ſo much ſmall beer: my eldeſt aunt likes a glaſs of dry
<hi>Mountain,</hi> while the other thinks nothing helps digeſtion ſo well
as <hi>Madeira.</hi> 'Twas but the other day, that my wife expreſſed a
deſire of taſting ſome <hi>Claret,</hi> when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all my
good-natured relations had a mighty <pb n="477" facs="tcp:1252700302:58"/> longing for it: but
with much ado I at laſt prevailed on them to compound with me for a cheſt
of <hi>Florence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>YOU may imagine, that my houſe cannot be a very ſmall one:
and I aſſure you there are as many beds in it, as in a country inn. Yet I
have ſcarce room to turn myſelf about in it; for one apartment is taken up
by this relation, another by that; and the moſt diſtant couſin muſt
have more reſpect ſhewn her than to be clapped up in a garret with the
maid-ſervants: ſo that poor I have no more liberty in my own houſe than a
lodger. Once, indeed, I in vain endeavoured to ſhake them off, and took a
little box in the neighbourhood of town, ſcarce big enough to hold my own
family. But alas! they ſtuck as cloſe to it, as a ſnail to her ſhell:
and rather than not lie under the ſame roof with their relation, they
contrived to litter together like ſo many pigs in a ſtye. At another time,
thinking to clear my houſe at once of theſe vermin, I packed up my wife and
mother, and ſent them to her uncle's in the country for a month. But what
could I do? there was no getting rid of thoſe left behind: my wife had made
over to them the care of the houſehold, allotting to each of them her
particular employment during her abſence. One was to pickle walnuts, another
to preſerve ſweetmeats, another to make Morella brandy; all which they
executed with the notableneſs peculiar to good houſewives, who ſpoil and
waſte more than they ſave, for the ſatisfaction of making theſe things
at home. At laſt my wife returned; and all that I got by her journey, was the
importation of two new couſins freſh out of the country, who ſhe never
knew before were the leaſt related to her:—but they have been ſo kind
as to claim kindred with me by hanging upon me ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="478" facs="tcp:1252700302:59"/>ONE would imagine, that it were
ſufficient for theſe loving relations to have the run of my table, and to
make my houſe in every reſpect their own: but not content with this, they
have the cunning to oblige me in a manner to find them in cloaths likewiſe. I
ſhould not repine, if any of my worthy relations were humble enough to put up
with a caſt-off ſuit of my wife's; but that would be robbing the maid of
her juſt dues, and would look more like a dependant than a relation: Not but
that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend now and then to take a gown, before it is half
worn out, (when they have talked my wife into a diſlike of
it)—becauſe it is too good for a common ſervant. They have more
ſpirit than to <hi>beg</hi> any thing: but—if my wife has a fancy to
<hi>part</hi> with it—they will wear it, purely for her ſake. A cap, an
apron, or an handkerchief, which looks hideous upon her, I always find is very
becoming on any other of the family: and I remember, ſoon after we were
married, happening to find fault with the pattern of a ſilk brocade my wife
had juſt bought, one of her ſiſters took it from her, and told me ſhe
would have it made up for herſelf, and wear it on purpoſe to ſpite
me.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt know, Mr. TOWN, that upon my marriage I was
indiſcreet enough to ſet up my chariot: and ſince my family has
increaſed ſo prodigiouſly, this has given them a handle to have a coach
likewiſe, and another pair of horſes, for them to take an airing in. This
alſo furniſhes them with a pretence for running about to public
diverſions, where I am forced to treat them all: for they are ſo very fond
of each others company, that one will hardly ever ſtir out without the other.
Thus, at home or abroad, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly herd together: and what is ſtill
more provoking, <pb n="479" facs="tcp:1252700302:60"/> though I had rather have a route every
week at my houſe, my wife makes a merit of it, that ſhe keeps little or no
company.</p>
                     <p>SUCH is the ſtate of my family within doors: and though you
would think this ſufficient for one man, I can aſſure you that I have
other calls on me from relations no leſs dear to me, though I have never yet
had the happineſs to ſee them. A third couſin by my wife's father's
ſide was ſet up in the country in a very good way of buſineſs; but by
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in trade muſt have gone to jail, if my wife had not teized me
into being bound for him, and for which I was ſoon after arreſted, and
obliged to pay the money. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a very promiſing youth, was juſt out of
his time, and only wanted a little ſum to ſet him up; which as ſoon as I
had lent him, he run away, and is gone to ſea. One of the aunts, who is now
with me, (a widow lady) has an only daughter, a ſober diſcreet body, who
lived as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with an old gentlewoman in the country: but the poor
innocent girl being drawn aſide by a vile fellow that ruined her, I have been
forced to ſupport the unhappy mother and child ever ſince, to prevent any
reproach falling on our family. I ſhall ſay nothing of the various
preſents, which have travelled down to my wife's uncle, in return for one
turkey and chine received at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; nor ſhall I put to account
the charge I have been at, in the goſſips fees, and in buying corals,
&amp;c. for half a dozen little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, neices, and couſins, to which I had
the honour of ſtanding godfather.</p>
                     <p>AND now, Mr. TOWN, the mention of this laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
makes me reflect with an heavy heart on a new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, <pb n="480" facs="tcp:1252700302:61"/>
which will ſhortly befal me. My wife, you muſt know, is very near her time:
and they have provided as great a ſtore of caps, clouts, biggens,
belly-bands, whittles, and all kinds of childbed-linnen, as would ſet up a
Lying-in Hoſpital. You will conclude that my family wants no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

another aunt, and another couſin, are coming up in the ſtage coach to ſee
their relation, and are reſolved to ſtay with her the month. Indeed I am
afraid, when they have once got footing in my houſe, they will reſolve to
ſtay with her till ſhe has another and another child.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> MERE Country Squire, who paſſes all his time among dogs
and horſes, is now become an uncommon character; and the moſt aukward
loobily inheritor of an old manſion-houſe is a fine gentleman in
compariſon to his forefathers. The principles of a town education for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſcarce ſpread themſelves beyond the narrow limits of the bills of
mortality: but now every <hi>London</hi> refinement travels to the remoteſt
corner of the kingdom, and the polite families from the town duly import to
their diſtant ſeats the cuſtoms and manners of <hi>Pall-mall</hi> and
<hi>Groſvenor-Square.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="482" facs="tcp:1252700302:63"/>I HAVE been for this fortnight paſt at
Lord <hi>Courtley</hi>'s, who for about four months in every year leads a town
life at the diſtance of above two hundred miles from <hi>London.</hi> He
never riſes till twelve or one o'clock; though indeed he often ſees the
ſun riſe; but then that only happens, when, as the old ſong ſays, he
has 
<q rend="inline">"drank down the moon."</q> Drinking is the
only rural amuſement he perſues, but even that part of his diverſions is
conducted entirely in the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> faſhion. He does not ſwill
country ale, but gets drunk with Champagne and Burgundy; and every diſh at
his table is ſerved up with as much elegance as at <hi>White</hi>'s or
<hi>Ryan</hi>'s. He has an excellent pack of hounds: but, I believe, was never
in at the death of a fox in his life: yet ſtrangers never want a chace, for
the hounds are out three times a week with a younger brother of Lord
<hi>Courtley</hi>'s, who never ſaw <hi>London</hi> in his life; and who, if
he was not indulged with a place at his lordſhip's table, might naturally be
conſidered as his whipper-in, or his game-keeper.</p>
                     <p>THE evening-walk is a thing unknown and unheard of at Lord
<hi>Courtley</hi>'s: for, though ſituated in a very fine country, he knows no
more of the charms of purling ſtreams and ſhady groves, than if they never
exiſted but in poetry or romance. As ſoon as the daily debauch after
dinner, and the ceremonies of coffee and tea are over, the company is conducted
into a magnificent apartment illuminated with wax-candles, and ſet but with
as many card-tables, as the route of a foreign ambaſſador's lady. Here
Faro, Whiſt, Brag, Lanſquenet, and every other faſhionable game make up
the evening's entertainment. This piece of politeneſs has ſometimes fallen
heavy on ſome honeſt country gentlemen, who have found dining with his
lordſhip turn out a very dear ordinary; and many a good lady has had
occaſion to <pb n="483" facs="tcp:1252700302:64"/> curſe the cards, and her ill-ſtarred
connections with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality: though his lordſhip is never at a
loſs for a party, for as ſeveral people of faſhion have ſeats near him,
he often ſits down with ſome of his friends of the club at
<hi>White</hi>'s. I had almoſt forgot to mention that her ladyſhip
<hi>keeps a day,</hi> which is Sunday.</p>
                     <p>THIS, Dear Couſin, is the genteel manner of living in the
country; and I cannot help obſerving, that perſons polite enough to be fond
of ſuch exquiſite refinements, are partly in the ſame caſe with the
mechanic at his duſty villa. They both, indeed, change their ſituation; but
neither find the leaſt alteration in their ideas. The tradeſman, when at
his box, has all the notions that employ him in his compting-houſe: and the
nobleman, though in the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of <hi>England,</hi> may ſtill be
ſaid to breath the air of St. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>I WAS chiefly induced to ſend you this ſhort account of
the refined manner, in which perſons of faſhion paſs their time at Lord
<hi>Courtley</hi>'s, becauſe I think it a very ſtriking contraſt to the
character deſcribed in the incloſed paper. I hope your readers will not do
either you or me the honour to think this natural deſcription a mere creature
of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. The picture of the extraordinary gentleman here
deſcribed is now at the ſeat of Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> at St.
<hi>Giles</hi>'s near <hi>Cranborn</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and this
lively character of him was really and truly drawn by <hi>Anthony Aſhly
Cowper,</hi> firſt Earl of <hi>Shaftſbury,</hi> and is inſcribed on the
picture. I doubt not but you will be glad of being able to communicate it to
the public, and that they will receive it with their uſual candour.</p>

                           <head>The Character of the Honourable W. HASTINGS of
<hi>Woodlands</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire;</hi> Second Son of FRANCIS Earl of
<hi>Huntingdon.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>IN the Year 1638 lived Mr. <hi>Haſtings</hi>; by his
Quality Son, Brother, and Uncle to the Earls of <hi>Huntingdon.</hi> He was
peradventure an original in our Age; or rather the Copy of our ancient
Nobility, in hunting, not in warlike times.</p>
                           <p>He was low, very ſtrong and very active; of a
reddiſh flaxen Hair. His Cloaths always green Cloth, and never all worth
(when new) five Pounds.</p>
                           <p>His Houſe was perfectly of the old Faſhion, in the
midſt of a large Park well ſtocked with Deer; and near the Houſe Rabits
to ſerve his Kitchen; many Fiſhponds; great ſtore of Wood and Timber; a
Bowling Green in it, long but narrow, full of high Ridges, it being never
levell'd ſince it was plough'd. They uſed round Sand Bowls; and it had a
Banquetting Houſe like a Stand, built in a Tree.</p>
                           <p>He kept all Manner of Sport Hounds, that ran Buck, Fox,
Hare, Otter, and Badger. And Hawks, long and ſhort winged. He had all Sorts
of Nets for Fiſh. He had a Walk in the <hi>New Foreſt,</hi> and the Manor
of <hi>Chriſt-Church.</hi> This laſt ſupply'd him with Red Deer, Sea and
River Fiſh. And indeed all his Neighbours Grounds and Royalties were free to
him, who beſtow'd all his Time on theſe Sports, but what he borrow'd to
careſs his Neighbours Wives and Daughters; there being not a Woman in all his
Walks, of the Degree of a Yeoman's Wife or under, and under the Age of forty,
but it was extremely her Fault, if he was not intimately acquainted with her.
This made him very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular; always ſpeaking kindly to the Huſband, Brother
or Father: who was to boat, very welcome to his Houſe, whenever he came.
There he found Beef, Pudding, and <pb n="485" facs="tcp:1252700302:66"/> ſmall Beer in great
plenty. A Houſe not ſo neatly kept as to ſhame <hi>Him</hi> or his dirty
ſhoes: the great Hall ſtrow'd with Marrow-bones, full of Hawks-Perches,
Hounds, Spaniels and Terriers: the upper Side of the Hall hung with Fox-ſkins
of this and the laſt Year's kiiling; here and there a Pole-Cat intermixt;
Game-keepers and Hunter's Poles in great Abundance.</p>
                           <p>The Parlour was a large Room as properly furniſhed. On
a great Hearth paved with Brick lay ſome Terriers, and the choiceſt Hounds
and Spaniels. Seldom but two of the great Chairs had litters of young Cats in
them; which were not to be diſturbed; he having always three or four
attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at Dinner; and a little white round Stick of fourteen Inches
lying by his Trencher, that he might defend ſuch Meat as he had no mind to
part with to them. The Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows (which were very large) ſerved for Places to
lay his Arrows, Croſs-Bows, Stone-Bows, and other ſuch like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements.
The Corners of the Room full of the beſt-choſe Hunting and Hawking Poles.
An Oyſter Table at the lower End, which was of conſtant Uſe twice a Day
all the Year round. For he never failed to eat Oyſters, before Dinner and
Supper, through all Seaſons; the neighb'ring Town of <hi>Pool</hi> ſupply'd
him with them.</p>
                           <p>The upper part of the Room had two ſmall Tables and a
Deſk, on the one ſide of which was a Church Bible, and on the other the
Book of Martyrs. On the Table were Hawks-Hoods, Bells, and ſuch like; two or
three old green Hats, with their Crowns thruſt in ſo as to hold ten or a
dozen Eggs, which were of a Pheaſant kind of Poultry he took much care of and
fed himſelf. Tables, Dice, Cards, and Boxes were not wanting. In the Hole of
the Deſk were ſtore of Tobacco Pipes that had been uſed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="486" facs="tcp:1252700302:67"/>On one Side of this End of the Room
was the Door of a Cloſet wherein ſtood the Strong Beer and the Wine, which
never came thence but in ſingle Glaſſes; that being the Rule of the
Houſe exactly obſerv'd. For he never exceeded in Drink or permitted it.</p>
                           <p>On the other Side was the Door into an old Chapel, not
uſed for Devotion. The Pulpit, as the ſafeſt Place, was never wanting of
a cold Chine of Beef, Veniſon Paſty, Gammon of Bacon, or great Apple-pye
with thick Cruſt, extremely baked.</p>
                           <p>His Table coſt him not much; though it was good to eat
at. His Sports ſupplied all but Beef and Mutton, except Fridays, when he had
the beſt Saltfiſh (as well as other Fiſh) he could get; and was the Day
his Neighbours of beſt Quality moſt viſited him. He never wanted a
<hi>London</hi> Pudding, and always ſung it in with <hi>My Part lies
therein-a.</hi> He drank a Glaſs or two of Wine at Meals; very often Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Gilly-flower in his Sack; and had always a Tun Glaſs, without Feet,
ſtood by him, holding a Pint of Small-Beer which he often ſtirr'd with
Roſemary.</p>
                           <p>He was well natured but ſoon angry, calling his
Servants, Baſtards and cuckoldy Knaves, in one of which he often ſpoke
Truth to his own Knowledge; and ſometimes in both, though of the ſame Man.
He lived to be an hundred; never loſt his Eye-ſight, but always wrote and
read without Spectacles; and got on Horſeback without Help. Until paſt
fourſcore he rode to the Death of a Stag as well as any.</p>

correſpondent in making it the entertainment of to-day.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <opener>
                        <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>AS you are now going to the Univerſity, I would not be
thought to pay ſo ill a compliment to your own natural good ſenſe, as to
ſuppoſe, that you will not (like many young gentlemen of fortune) in ſome
meaſure apply yourſelf to ſtudy: otherwiſe the time you ſpend there 
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:1252700302:69"/> will be entirely loſt; for (as the SPECTATOR very
juſtly remarks) 
<q rend="inline">"all ornamental parts of education are better
taught in other places."</q> At the ſame time I do not mean, that you
ſhould commence Pedant, and be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poring on a book; ſince that
will rather puzzle than inform the underſtanding. Though I know many
ſprightly young gentlemen of lively and quick parts affect to deſpiſe it
altogether, it will be neceſſary to learn ſomething of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic; I mean in
the ſame manner one would learn Fencing—not to attack others, but to
defend one's ſelf. In a word, you will find it a great unhappineſs, when
you return hither, if you do not bring with you ſome taſte for reading: for
a mere Country Gentleman, who can find no ſociety in books, will have little
elſe to do, (beſides following his ſports,) but to ſit (as ſquire of
the company) tippling among a parcel of idle wretches, whoſe underſtandings
are nearly on a level with his dogs and horſes.</p>
                     <p>IT has been an eſtabliſhed maxim, that the world will
always form an opinion of perſons according to the company they are known to
keep. In the Univerſity, as well as in other places, there are people, whom
we ought to avoid, as we would the plague: and as it is of the utmoſt
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whether you plunge at once into extravagance and debauchery, or
ſink gradually into indolence and ſtupidity, I ſhall point out ſome of
theſe peſts of ſociety in as few words as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt perſon I would caution you againſt, is the
wretch that takes a delight to turn religion into ridicule: one that employs
that ſpeech, which was given him by God to celebrate his praiſe, in
queſtioning his very being. This, as it is impious in itſelf, is likewiſe
the height of <pb n="495" facs="tcp:1252700302:70"/> ill-manners. It is hoped there are but few
of them to be met with in a place of ſound doctrine and religious education:
but wherever they are, they ought as much as poſſible to be avoided: and if
they will force themſelves into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they ſhould be uſed with
the ſame contempt, with which they have the hardineſs to treat their Maker.
And this, I can aſſure you, may be done ſafely: for I never knew any
body, who pretended to be above the fear of God, but was under the moſt
terrible apprehenſions, whenever attacked by man.</p>
                     <p>THE next character whom I would adviſe you to ſhun, is the
GAMESTER, in ſome reſpects not unlike the former. The gaming-table is his
ſhrine, and fortune his deity; nor does he ever ſpeak or think of any
other, unleſs by way of blaſphemy, oaths and curſes, when he has had a
bad run at cards or dice, He has not the leaſt notion of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but
would ruin his own brother, if it might be of any advantage to himſelf. He,
indeed, profeſſes himſelf your friend; but that is only with a deſign
to draw you in: for his trade is inconſiſtent with the principles of honour
or juſtice, without which there can be no real friendſhip. It ſhould
therefore be the care of every gentleman not to hold any commerce with ſuch
people, whoſe acquaintance he cannot enjoy, without giving up his
eſtate.</p>
                     <p>THE next perſon, whom you ought to beware of, is a DRUNKARD;
one that takes an unaccountable pleaſure in ſapping his conſtitution, and
drowning his underſtanding. He conſtantly goes ſenſeleſs to bed, and
riſes maukiſh in the morning: nor can he be eaſy in body or mind, 'till
he has renewed his doſe, and again put himſelf beyond the reach of
reflection. I would therefore entreat you by all <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1252700302:71"/> means to
avoid an habit, which will at once ruin your health, and impair your
intellects. It is a misfortune, that ſociety ſhould be eſteemed dull and
inſipid without the aſſiſtance of the bottle to enliven it; ſo that a
man cannot entirely refrain from his glaſs, if he keeps any company at all.
But let it be remembered, that in drinking, as well as in talking, we ought
always to keep a 
<q rend="inline">"watch over the doors of our lips."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A LOWNGER is a creature, that you will often ſee lolling in
a coffee-houſe, or ſauntering about the ſtreets, with great calmneſs,
and a moſt inflexible ſtupidity in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. He takes as much pains
as the Sot, to fly from his own thoughts, and is at length happily arrived at
the higheſt pitch of indolence both in mind and body. He would be as
inoffenſive, as he is dull, if it were not that his idleneſs is contagious;
for, like the <hi>torpedo,</hi> he is ſure to benumb and take away all
ſenſe of feeling from every one, with whom he happens to come in
contact.</p>
                     <p>IT were alſo beſt to forbear the company of a WRANG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER,
or a perſon of a litigious temper. This ſometimes ariſes, not from any
great ſhare of ill-nature, but from a vain pride of ſhowing one's parts, or
ſkill in argumentation. It is frequently obſerved of young Academics in
particular, that they are very apt impertinently to engage people in a
diſpute whether they will or not. But this is contrary to all the rules of
good-breeding, and is never practiſed by any man of ſenſe, that has
ſeen much of the world. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times known a perſon of great
ſaucineſs, and volubility of expreſſion, confuted by the <hi>Argumentum
Baculinum,</hi> and both his head and his ſyllogiſm broken at the ſame
time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="497" facs="tcp:1252700302:72"/>I NEED not point out to you the
profligate RAKE or the affected COXCOMB, as perſons from whoſe company you
can reap no ſort of benefit. From the firſt the good principles, already
inſtilled into you, will doubtleſs preſerve you; and I am ſure you have
too much real ſenſe, not to deſpiſe the abſurd fopperies of the
latter. Noted LYARS are no leſs to be avoided, as the common peſts of
ſociety. They are often of a miſchievous diſpoſition, and by their
calumnies and falſe ſuggeſtions take a pleaſure in ſetting the moſt
intimate friends at variance. But if they only deal in harmleſs and
improbable lies, their acquaintance muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be out of countenance
for them: and if we ſhould venture to repeat after them, I am ſure it is
the way to be out of countenance for ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>BUT above all I muſt adviſe you never to engage, at
leaſt not with any degree of violence, in any PARTY. Be not tranſported by
the clamorous jollity of talking patriots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſober dictates of
reaſon and juſtice; nor let the inſinuating voice of corruption tempt you
to barter your integrity and peace of mind for the paultry ſatiſfaction of
improving your fortune. If you behave with honour and prudence, you will be
regarded and courted by all parties; but if otherwiſe, you will certainly be
deſpiſed by all. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps indeed, if you ſhould hereafter engage in
elections, and ſpend your own money to ſupport another's cauſe, the
perſon, in whoſe intereſt you are, may ſhake you by the hand, and
ſwear you are a very honeſt gentleman:—juſt as butchers treat their
bull-dogs, who ſpit in their mouths, clap them on the back, and then halloo
them on to be toſſed and torn by the horns of their antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>AFTER having guarded you againſt the evil influence of your
own ſex, I cannot conclude without throwing in a <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1252700302:73"/> word
or two concerning the Ladies. But that I may not be thought unmannerly to the
fair, I ſhall paſs over their faults; only hoping, that their excellencies
will not tempt you to precipitate a match with one much your inferior in birth
and fortune, though 
<q rend="inline">"endowed with every accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
requiſite to make the marriage ſtate happy."</q> In theſe haſty and
unequal matches it ſometimes happens, that mutual love gives way to mutual
reproaches. We may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too late repent of our bargain: and though
Repentance be an excellent viſiting friend, when ſhe reminds us of our
paſt miſcarriages, and preſcribes rules how to avoid them for the future,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE genius is the chief requiſite in all kinds of poetry,
nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the very eſſence of it, than the adopting,
as beauties, certain arts, which are merely mechanical. There are daily
ariſing many whimſical excellencies which have no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in nature,
but are only countenanced by the preſent mode of writing: with theſe it is
as eaſy to fill our compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as to dreſs ourſelves in the
faſhion; but the writer, who puts his work together in this manner, is no
more a poet than his taylor. Such productions often betray great labour and
exactneſs, but ſhew no genius: for thoſe who ſit down to write by rule,
and follow 
<q rend="inline">"dry receipts how <pb n="500" facs="tcp:1252700302:75"/> poems
ſhould be made,"</q> may compoſe their pieces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt
aſſiſtance from the imagination; as an apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's prentice; though
unable to cure any diſeaſe, can make up medicines from the phyſician's
preſcription, with no more knowledge of phyſic than the names of the drugs.
Thus the Muſe that ought to fly, and 
<q rend="inline">"aſcend the brighteſt heaven of
invention,"</q> walks in leading-ſtrings, or is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a
go-cart.</p>
               <p>AMONG the many poetical tricks of this ſort, none has been
more ſucceſsfully practiſed, or had more advocates and admirers, than a
certain fantaſtical conceit called ALLITERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION: which is nothing more than
beginning two, three, or perhaps every word in a line with the ſame letter.
This method of running diviſions upon the alphabet, and preſſing
particular letters into the ſervice, has been accounted one of the firſt
excellencies in verſification, and has indeed received the ſanction of
ſome of our beſt poets; but wherein the beauty of it conſiſts, is
ſomething difficult to diſcover: ſince <hi>Quarles</hi> or
<hi>Withers</hi> might practiſe it with as much adroit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as
<hi>Dryden</hi> or <hi>Spenſer.</hi> It is one of thoſe modern arts in
poetry which require no fancy, judgment, or learning in the execution: for an
author may huddle the ſame letters on each other again and again, as
mechanically as the printer ſelects his types, and ranges them in
whatſoever order he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>THIS partial attachment to particular letters is a kind of
contraſt to the famous Odyſſey of <hi>Tryphiodorus,</hi> where every
letter in the alphabet was in its turn excluded: and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literator muſt be
as buſily employed to introduce his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite vowel or conſonant, as the
<hi>Greek</hi> poet to ſhut out the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had proſcribed. Nothing is
eſteemed a greater beauty <pb n="501" facs="tcp:1252700302:76"/> in poetry than a happy choice
of epithets; but Alliteration reduces all the elegancies of expreſſion to a
very narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Epithets are culled indeed with great exactneſs, but
the cloſeſt relation they are intended to bear to the word to which they
are joined, is that the initials are the ſame. Thus the <hi>fields</hi>
muſt be <hi>flowry, beauty</hi> muſt be <hi>beaming, ladies</hi> muſt be
<hi>lovely,</hi> and in the ſame manner muſt the 
<q rend="inline">"waves wind their watry way,"</q> the 
<q rend="inline">"bluſtring blaſts blow,"</q> and 
<q rend="inline">"locks all looſely lay,"</q> not for the
ſake of the poetry, but the elegance of the Alliteration. This beauty has
alſo taken poſſeſſion of many of our tragedies, and I have ſeen
ladies wooed and heroes killed in it: though I muſt own I never hear an actor
dying with deadly darts and fiery flames &amp;c. but it always puts me in mind
of the celebrated pippin-woman in <hi>Gay</hi>'s <hi>Trivia,</hi> whoſe head,
when it was ſevered from her body, rolled along the ice crying <hi>pip, pip,
pip,</hi> and expired in Alliteration.</p>
               <p>THE ſame falſe taſte in writing that 
<q rend="inline">"wings diſplay'd and altars rais'd,"</q>
alſo introduced Alliteration; and Acroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics in particular are the ſame
kind of ſpelling-book poetry. It is therefore ſomewhat extraordinary that
thoſe ſublime writers, who have diſgraced their pages with it, did not
leave this as well as the other barbarous parts of literature to the
<hi>Goths</hi> in poetry: ſince it is a whimſical beauty, below the
practice of any writer, ſuperior to him who turned the <hi>Aencid</hi> into
Monkiſh verſes. <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> who was more indebted to nature
than art, has ridiculed this low trick with great humour in his burleſque
tragedy of <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thiſbe.</hi> Beſides that noted
paſſage of 
<q> 
                     <l>—With blade, with bloody, blameful blade</l> 
                     <l>He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breaſt,</l>
                  </q> 
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:1252700302:77"/> He before introduces a mock rant, which <hi>Bottom</hi>
calls <hi>Ercles'</hi> vein, which is not only rank fuſtian, but is alſo
remarkable for its Alliteration. <hi>To make all ſplit the raging rocks, and
ſhivering ſhocks ſhall break the locks of priſon gates—and</hi>
Phibbus <hi>car ſhall ſhine from far, and make and mar the fooliſh
fates.</hi> In this ſtrange ſtile have whole poems been written, and every
learned reader will recollect on this occaſion the <hi>Pugna Porcorum per P.
Porcium Poetam,</hi> which I wiſh ſome of our poetaſters would
tranſlate, in the true ſpirit of the original, and praiſe pigs and pork
with all the beauties of Alliteration.</p>
               <p>THE advocates and admirers of this practice have aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it adds ſignificance and ſtrength of expreſſion to their verſes,
but I fear this boaſted energy ſeldom appears to the reader. The
Alliteration either remains unregarded, or, if it is very ſtriking,
diſguſts thoſe who perceive it, and is often in itſelf, from ſuch a
diſagreeable cluſter of the ſame letters, harſh and uncouth. There are
very many inſtances where Alliteration, though ſtudiouſly introduced,
renders the verſification rough and inharmonious; and I will appeal to the
greatest lovers of it, whether the following line, where the repetition was
ſcarce intended, is one of the moſt pleaſing in all <hi>Virgil</hi>'s
works. 
<q> 
                     <l>Neu patriae Validas in Viſcera Vertite Vires.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>IT muſt be acknowledged, that there is ſomething very
mechanical in the whole conſtruction of the numbers in moſt of our modern
poetry. Sound is more attended to than ſenſe, and the words are expected to
expreſs more than the ſentiment. There are ſet rules to make verſes run
off glibly, or drawl ſlowly on, &amp;c. and I have read many a 
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:1252700302:78"/> poem with ſcarce one tolerable thought in it, that has
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all theſe excellencies of verſification: for which reaſon I
muſt confeſs myſelf no friend to thoſe critics, who analyſe words and
ſyllables, and diſcover latent beauties in every letter, when the author
intended that the whole ſhould be taken together. Poetry ſhould ſeem at
leaſt to flow freely from the imagination, and not to be ſqueezed from the
droppings of the brain. If we would endeavour to acquire a full idea of what we
mean to deſcribe, we ſhould then of courſe expreſs ourſelves with
force, elegance, and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity: and this native ſtrength of
expreſſion would have more true energy than elaborate phraſes, and a
quaint and ſtudied combination of words and letters. Fine numbers are
undoubtedly one of the chief beauties in poetry; but to make the ſound echo
to the ſenſe, we ſhould make the ſenſe our chief object. This appears
to me to have been the manly practice of the Ancients, and of our own
<hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, Milton,</hi> &amp;c. who breathed the true ſpirit of
poetry, without having recourſe to little tricks and mean artifices, which
only ſerve to diſgrace it. A good writer, who would be above triffling even
with a thought, would never perſue words, and play with letters, but leave
ſuch a childiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the ſmall fry of rhimers who amuſe
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with anagrams and crambo. The true poet truſts to his natural
ear and ſtrong conception, and knows that the verſification is adapted to
the ſentiment without culling particular letters, and ſtringing them on his
lines; as he is ſure that his verſes are juſt meaſure, without
ſcanning them on his fingers.</p>
               <p>THERE are almoſt daily publiſhed certain Lilliputian
volumes, entitled <hi>Pretty Books for Children.</hi> A friend of mine 
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:1252700302:79"/> who conſiders the little rhimers of the age as only 
<q rend="inline">"children of a larger growth,"</q> who amuſe
themſelves with rhimes inſtead of rattles, propoſes to publiſh a
ſmall pocket volume for the uſe of our Poetaſters. It will be a
treatiſe on the art of poetry <hi>adapted to the meaneſt capacities,</hi>
for which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions will be taken, and ſpecimens may be ſeen, at
<hi>George</hi>'s and the <hi>Bedford</hi> coffee-houſes. It will contain
full directions how to modulate the numbers on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and will
inſtruct the young ſcribbler in all the modern arts of verſification. He
will here meet with infallible rules how to ſoften a line and lull us to
ſleep with liquids and dipthongs; to roughen the verſe and make it roar
again with reiteration of the letter R; to ſet it hiſſing with
ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowels; to make it pant and breathe short with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred heavy
aſpirates; or clog it up with the thickeſt double conſonants and
monoſyllables: with a particular table of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literation, containing the
choiceſt epithets for any words that can be wanted. To be illuſtrated with
examples from the modern poets. The whole to be publiſhed about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the winter under the title of <hi>The Rhimer's Play-thing,</hi> or,
<hi>Poetaſter's Horn-book;</hi> ſince there is nothing neceſſary to
form ſuch a poet, except teaching him his letters.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU obliged the world ſome time ago with a few reflections
on the Gentlemen of the Army: at the preſent juncture, a word or two on our
Sea-Officers would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable. I do not mean that you ſhould
preſume to direct them how to behave in their ſeveral ſtations, but
rather to remark on their conduct and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in private life, as far
as they are influenced by their maritime characters. There is a certain
unfaſhionable dye, which their manners often take from the ſalt-water, that
tinctures their whole behaviour on ſhore. If you could <pb n="506" facs="tcp:1252700302:81"/>
aſſiſt in blotting out theſe ſtains, and give a new colour to their
conduct, you would add grace and politeneſs to their ordinary converſation,
and would be of as much ſervice to our naval commanders in this point, as he
was to navigation in general, who firſt invented the compaſs.</p>
                     <p>AS the converſation of thoſe fair-weather foplings, many
of whom may be met with in the three regiments of guards, is uſually flat and
inſipid, that of our ſea-officers is turbulent and boiſterous: and as a
trip to <hi>Paris</hi> has perhaps over-refined the coxcomb in red, a voyage
round the world fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently brutalizes the ſeaman, who comes home ſo rough
and unpoliſhed, that one would imagine he had not viſited any nation in the
world except the Savages, the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> or the <hi>Hottentots.</hi>
The many advantages he has received from having ſeen the cuſtoms and
manners of ſo many different people, it is natural to ſuppoſe, would
render his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation very deſirable, as being in itſelf particularly
inſtructive and entertaining: but this roughneſs, which clings to the
ſeaman's behaviour like tar to his trowſers, makes him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for all civil
and polite ſociety. He behaves at an aſſembly as if he was upon deck; and
his whole deportment mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly betrays, that he is, according to the common
phraſe, quite out of his element. Nor can you collect any more from him
concerning the ſeveral nations he has viſited, than if he had been during
the whole time confined to his cabin: and he ſeems to know as little of them,
as the fine gentleman of his travels after the polite tour, when he has, for
the ſake of improvement, rid poſt through all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THAT our ordinary ſeamen, who are, many of them draughted
from the very loweſt of the populace, ſhould be thus uncivilized, is no
wonder. The common ſailor's <pb n="507" facs="tcp:1252700302:82"/> education in <hi>Broad St.
Giles's, Tottenham Court,</hi> or at <hi>Hock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in the Hole,</hi> has not
qualified him to improve by juſt reflections on what he ſees during his
voyage; and going on board a man of war is a kind of univerſity education,
ſuitably adapted to the principles imbibed in the polite ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, which
he came from. A common ſailor too is full as polite as a common ſoldier;
and behaves as genteely to a <hi>Wapping</hi> landlady as the gentleman
ſoldier at a ſuttling-houſe. But ſurely there ought to be as much
difference in the behaviour of the commander and his crew, as there is in their
ſituation: and it is beneath the dignity of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Flag to
have an Admiral behave as rudely as a Swabber, or a Commodore as foul-mouthed
as a Boatſwain.</p>
                     <p>IT may perhaps be alledged in excuſe, that the being placed
among ſuch a boiſterous ſet of people, as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſailors, muſt
unavoidably wear off all politeneſs and good-manners: as it is remarkable,
that all thoſe who are employed in the care of horſes, grow as mere brutes
as the animals they attend; and as we may often obſerve thoſe juſtices,
whoſe chief buſineſs is the examination of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waymen, houſe-breakers,
and ſtreet-walkers, grow at leaſt as vulgar and foul-mouthed as a
pick-pocket. As there may be ſome truth in this, the commander ſhould
therefore be ſtill more on his guard to preſerve the gentleman in his
behaviour, and like the ſea itſelf, when the ſtorm is over, grow ſmooth
and calm. It is accounted a piece of humour on the <hi>Thames</hi> to abuſe
the other paſſengers on the water; and there are certain ſet terms of
abuſe, which fly to and fro from one boat to another on this occaſion. A
wag might perhaps amuſe himſelf with this water-language in his voyage to
<hi>Vaux-Hall,</hi> but muſt be a very ſilly fellow indeed, to think of
carrying the joke on ſhore with him. In <pb n="508" facs="tcp:1252700302:83"/> the ſame
manner ſome roughneſs may perhaps be neceſſary to keep the crew in
order; but it is abſurd for an officer to retain his harſhneſs in polite
company: and is in a manner tying his friends up to the yard-arm, and
diſciplining all his acquaintance with the cat-of-nine-tails.</p>
                     <p>BUT the worſt part of this maritime character is a certain
invincible contempt, which they often contract for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, except their
fellow-ſeamen. They look on the reſt of the world as a ſet of
freſh-water wretches, who could be of no ſervice in a ſtorm or an
engagement; and from an unaccountable obſtinacy are particularly deaf to any
propoſals of new improvements in navigation: though experience daily teaches
them the great uſe of the diſcoveries already made, and how much room there
is for more. They have no notion, how ſtudious men can ſit in their
cloſets, and deviſe charts and inſtruments to direct them in their
courſe; and deſpiſe thoſe ingenious perſons, who would aſſiſt
them in their undertakings; while they conſider them with the utmoſt
contempt, as going round the world in their cloſets, and ſailing at ſea
in their elbow-chairs. It is no leſs ſhameful than true, that the
Ventilator, one of the moſt beneficial inventions that ever was deviſed,
was firſt offered to the ſervice of our men of war, and rejected. It was
firſt uſed in foreign ſhips, then by our merchantmen, and laſt of all
among our men of war, to whoſe uſe it was firſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. This is a
ſtrong proof of that fatal obſtinacy, which our Sea-Commanders are too apt
to contract; and as a further inſtance of it, I have been told of an
Admiral's indignation on this ſubject, venting itſelf in the following
manner. 
<q rend="inline">"A pack of blockheads, (ſaid he,) ſit
poring, and pretend to make improvements for our uſe. They 
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:1252700302:84"/> tell you that they diſcover this, and diſcover that;
but I tell you they are all fools.—For inſtance now, they ſay the
world is round; every one of them ſays the world is round;—but I have
been all round the world, and it is as flat as this table."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE chief reaſon of their unpoliſhed behaviour is owing to
their being often ſent to ſea very young with little or no education,
beyond what they have received perhaps at the academy of <hi>Woolwich</hi> or
<hi>Portſmouth.</hi> A lad of good family, but untoward parts, or
miſchievous diſpoſition, who has been flogged for a while at the
grammar-ſchool, or ſnubbed by his parents and friends at home, is
frequently clapped on board a ſhip in order to tame him, and to teach him
better manners. Here perhaps he at firſt meſſes with the loweſt of the
ſeamen: and all that the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can learn from his jolly meſmates
in the courſe of two or three voyages, is to drink flip, ſing a bawdy
catch, and dance an horn-pipe. Theſe genteel accompliſhments he is ſure
to retain, as he grows old in the ſervice; and if he has the good fortune to
riſe to a command, he is as ſurly and brutal when advanced to the cabin, as
when he was tugging before the maſt.</p>
                     <p>AFTER all it is but juſtice to confeſs, that there are
many among our Sea-Officers, who deſervedly bear the character of gentlemen
and ſcholars; and it is eaſy to perceive, with how much better grace they
appear in the world than the reſt of their brethren, who (when laid up and
taken out of ſervice) are as mere logs as the main-maſt. An officer, who
has any reliſh for reading, will employ the many vacant hours (in which he is
relieved from duty) much more to his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="510" facs="tcp:1252700302:85"/> and
ſatisfaction, than in ſauntering between the decks, or muddling over a bowl
of punch. I would therefore ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly recommend it to thoſe young
ſailors, who have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to launch forth with a genteel and liberal
education, not to ſuffer every trace of it to be waſhed away, like words
written on the ſands; but that, when they return from ſea, they may be fit
to be admitted at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, as well as at <hi>Wapping</hi> or
<hi>Rotherhithe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BEFORE I conclude, I muſt beg leave to ſay a word or two
concerning our Sea-Chaplains. The common ſailors are known to have, when on
board, a very ſerious regard for religion; and their decent behaviour at
prayers, and ſedate attention to the ſermon upon quarter-deck, might
ſhame a more polite audience at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church. For this
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a truly religious Chaplain of good morals and ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
will neceſſarily have as much influence on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, as a mild and
prudent Commander: Nor can a clergyman be too circumſpect in this point;
ſince, if he does not act in every reſpect conformable to his function, his
place for ought I know might be as well ſupplied by any one of the
unbeneficed Doctors of the Fleet. In a word, if a Chaplain will ſo far
diveſt himſelf of his ſacred character, as to drink, ſwear, and behave
in every reſpect like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſailor, he ſhould be obliged to work in
the gang-way all the reſt of the week, and on ſundays be inveſted with a
jacket and trowſers inſtead of his canonicals.</p>

ingenious friend Mr. <hi>James Ayſcough,</hi> Optician, on
<hi>Ludgate-Hill</hi>; and I then informed the public, that 
<q rend="inline">"the liquor contained within the tube was a
chymical mixture, which being acted upon by the circulation of the blood and
animal ſpirits, would riſe and fall according to the deſires and
affections of the wearer."</q> But I have now the further ſatisfaction to
acquaint my fair readers, that after ſeveral repeated trials and improvements
we have at length brought <pb n="512" facs="tcp:1252700302:87"/> the inſtrument to ſo great
a degree of perfection, that any common by-ſtander may, by a proper
application of it, know the exact temperature of any lady's paſſions. The
liquor, among other ſecret ingredients, is diſtilled <hi>ſecundúm
artem</hi> from the herbs lady's love, and maiden-hair, the wax of virgin-bees,
and the five greater hot and cold ſeeds: and the properties of it are ſo
ſubtle and penetrating, that immediately on its coming within the
atmoſphere of a lady's affections, it is actuated by them in the ſame
manner, as the ſpirits are by the impulſe of the air in the common
Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer.</p>
               <p>IT was not without ſome difficulty, that we could ſettle the
different degrees of heat and cold in a lady's deſires, which it would be
proper to delineate on our Thermometer: but at laſt we found, that the whole
ſcale of female characters might be reduced to one or other of the
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </list> 
               </p>
               <p>FROM theſe degrees, which we have accurately marked on the
ſide of the tube, we have been able to judge of the characters of ſeveral
ladies, on whom we have made the experiment. In ſome of theſe we have found
the grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions very ſudden; and that the liquor has riſen very faſt from
the loweſt point to the higheſt. We could likewiſe diſcover, that it
was differently affected according to the <pb n="513" facs="tcp:1252700302:88"/> different
ſtation and quality of the ſubject: ſo that the ſame actions, which in
a lady of faſhion ſcarce raiſed the liquor beyond INDISCRETIONS, in
another cauſed it to mount almoſt to IMPUDENCE. Much alſo depended upon
the air and temperature of the place, where we made our trials: and even the
dreſs had ſome influence on our Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter; as we frequently obſerved,
that the riſe and fall of the liquor in the tube bore an exact proportion to
the riſe and fall of the ſtays and petticoat.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now proceed to give a ſuccinct account of the many
repeated experiments, which we have made on differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubjects in different
places. During the winter ſeaſon we had frequent opportunities of trying
the effects, which the play-houſe, the opera, and other places of
diverſion, might have on the Thermometer. At the play-houſe we always found
the liquor riſe in proportion, as the drama was more or leſs indecent or
immoral: at ſome comedies, and particularly the <hi>Chances,</hi> its
elevation kept pace exactly with the luſciouſneſs of the dialogue and the
ripening of the plot; ſo that it has often happened, that with ſome
ſubjects, at the opening of the play, the liquor has ſtruggled a-while, and
roſe and ſunk about the degrees juſt above MODESTY; but before the third
act it has ſtood ſuſpended at the middle point between MODESTY and
IMPUDENCE; in the fourth act it has advanced as far as LOOSE BEHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; and at
the concluſion of the play it has ſettled at downright IMPUDENCE. At public
concerts, and the opera eſpecially, we obſerved that the Thermometer
conſtantly kept time (if I may ſay ſo) with the muſic and ſinging:
and both at the opera and the play-houſe, it always regulated its motions by
the dancer's heels. We have frequently <pb n="514" facs="tcp:1252700302:89"/> made trials of our
inſtrument at the maſquerades in the <hi>Hay-Market</hi>: but the
temperature of that climate has proved ſo exceeding hot, that on the moment
of our coming into the room the liquor has boiled up with a ſurpriſing
effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence to ABANDONED IMPUDENCE.</p>
               <p>DURING the ſummer ſeaſon we have not failed to make our
obſervations on the company at the public gardens. Here we found, indeed,
that with ſome raw unpoliſhed females, who came only to eat cheeſe-cakes
and ſee the fire-works, the liquor did not ſtir beyond MODESTY; with many
it has crept up to INDISCRETIONS; and with ſome it has advanced to LOOSE
BEHAVIOUR. We had no opportunity to try our Thermometer in the dark walks: but
with ſome ſubjects we have plainly perceived the liquor haſtening up
towards INNOCENT FREEDOMS, as they were retiring to theſe walks from the
reſt of the company; whilſt with others, who have gone the ſame way, it
has only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to point (as it did at the beginning of our
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations) at GALLANTRY. One young lady in particular we could not help
remarking, whom we followed into <hi>Vaux-Hall,</hi> gallanted by an officer;
we were glad to ſee, at her firſt going in, that the liquor, though it now
and then faintly aſpired towards INDISCRETIONS, ſtill gravitated back again
to MODESTY: after a turn or two in the walks we perceived it fluctuating
between INNOCENT FREEDOMS and LOOSE BEHAVIOUR: after this we loſt ſight of
them for ſome time; and at the concluſion of the entertainment (as we
followed them out) we could not without concern obſerve, that the liquor was
haſtily bubbling up to a degree next to IMPUDENCE.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:1252700302:90"/>BESIDES the experiments on thoſe ladies,
who frequent the public places of diverſion, we have been no leſs careful
in making remarks at ſeveral private routs and aſſemblies. We were here
at firſt very much ſurpriſed at the extreme degree of <hi>Cold</hi> which
our Thermometer ſeemed to indicate in ſeveral ladies, who were ſeated
round the card-tables; as we found not the leaſt alteration in it either from
the young or old: but we at laſt concluded, that this was owing to their love
of play, which had totally abſorbed all their other paſſions. We have,
indeed, more than once perceived, that when a lady has riſen from cards after
ſo much ill luck as to have involved herſelf in a debt of honour to a
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Thermometer has been ſurpriſingly effected; and as ſhe
has been handed to her chair, we have known the liquor, which before was quite
ſtagnate, run up inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the degree of GALLANTRY. We have
alſo been at the trouble to try its efficacy in the long rooms at <hi>Bath,
Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Cheltenham</hi> &amp;c. as it is well known, that theſe places
have brought about ſurpriſing changes in the conſtitutions of thoſe
SICK ladies, who go thither for the benefit of the waters.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus ſufficiently proved the perfection of our
Thermometer, it only remains to acquaint my readers, that Mr,
<hi>Ayſcough</hi> will be ready to ſupply the public with theſe uſeful
inſtruments, as ſoon as the town fills. In the mean time I would adviſe
thoſe ladies, who have the leaſt regard for their characters, to reflect
that the gradations, as marked on our Thermometer, naturally lead to each
other; that the tranſitions from the loweſt to the higheſt are quick and
obvious; and that though it is very eaſy to advance, it is impoſſible to
recede back again, Let them, therefore, be <pb n="516" facs="tcp:1252700302:91"/> careful to
regulate their paſſions in ſuch manner, as that their conduct may be
always conſiſtent with decency and honour; and (as <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>
ſays) 
<q rend="inline">"not ſtepping o'er the bounds of MODESTY."</q>
I ſhall conclude with obſerving, that theſe Thermometers are deſigned
only for the ladies: for though we imagined at firſt, that they might ſerve
equally for the men, we have found reaſon to alter our opinion; ſince, in
the courſe of ſeveral fruitleſs experiments on our own ſex, there has
ſcarce appeared any medium in them between MODESTY and IMPUDENCE.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been generally imagined, that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only to be
acquired in the cloſet, and by turning over a great number of pages; for
which reaſon men have been aſſiduous to heap together a parcel of duſty
volumes, and our youth have been ſent to ſtudy at the univerſities: as if
knowledge was ſhut up in a library, and chained to the ſhelves together
with the folios. This prejudice has made every one overlook the moſt obvious
and ready means of coming at literature; while (as the wiſe man has
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked) <pb n="518" facs="tcp:1252700302:93"/> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Wiſdom crieth without; ſhe uttereth her
voice in the ſtreets; ſhe crieth in the chief place of concourſe, in the
openings of the gates: in the city ſhe uttereth her words,"</q> and no man
regardeth her. Every lane teems with inſtruction, and every alley is big with
erudition: though the ignorant or incurious paſſer-by ſhuts his eyes
againſt that univerſal volume of arts and ſciences, which conſtantly
lies open before him in the highways and bye-places; like the laws of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> which were hung up in the public ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt know, Mr. TOWN, that I am a very hard ſtudent,
and have perhaps gleaned more knowledge from my reading, than any of your
poring fellows of colleges, though I was never poſſeſſed of ſo much
as an horn-book. In the courſe of my ſtudies I have followed the example of
of the ancient <hi>Peripatetics,</hi> who uſed to ſtudy walking: and as I
had not the advantage to be brought up a ſcholar, I have been obliged, like
the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> children, to the public for my education. My firſt
reliſh for letters I got by conning over thoſe elegant monoſyllables,
which are chalked out upon walls and gates, and which (as pretty books for
children are adorned with cuts) are generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and explained by
curious hieroglyphics in <hi>caricatura.</hi> I ſoon made a further
progreſs in the alphabet by ſtaring up at the large letters upon
play-bills, &amp;c. 'till at length I was enabled to make out the
inſcriptions upon ſigns, bills on empty houſes, and the titles on
rubric-poſts. From theſe I proceeded gradually to higher branches of
literature, and went through a complete courſe of phyſic by peruſing the
learned treatiſes of Dr. <hi>Rock</hi> and other eminent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
Having thus laid in the rudiments of literature, my <pb n="519" facs="tcp:1252700302:94"/>
method has ſince been to viſit the <hi>Philobiblian</hi> libraries, and
other learned ſtalls, and the noble collections at <hi>Moor-fields</hi>; in
which choice repoſitories I have with infinite pleaſure and advantage ran
over the elaborate ſyſtems of ancient divines, politicians, and
philoſophers, which have eſcaped the fury of paſtry-cooks and
trunk-makers. As for the modern writings of pamphletteers and
magazine-compilers, I make it my buſineſs to take my rounds every morning
at the open ſhops about the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi>; where I never fail to
run through every thing, freſh as it comes out. Thus, for example, I make a
ſhift to ſquint over the firſt page of the <hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> as
it lies before me, at Mrs. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s; at the next ſhop I ſteal a
peep at the middle pages, at another proceed on to the fourth or fifth, and
perhaps return again to conclude it at Mrs. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s. By the ſame
means I am myſelf become a <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> likewiſe; and you will
be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed when I aſſure you, that I have a great variety of the
fineſt prints and paintings, and am maſter of a more curious ſet of
nicknacks, than are to be found in Sir <hi>Hans Sloane</hi>'s
<hi>Collection:</hi> for, as I conſtantly ſurvey the windows of every
printſhop, and attend every auction, I look upon every curioſity as
actually in my poſſeſſion; and you will agree with me, that while I
have the opportunity of ſeeing them, the real owners cannot have more
ſatisfaction in locking them up in cabinets and muſaeums.</p>
                     <p>YOU will conclude, that the knowledge, which I have thus
picked out of the ſtreets, has been very extenſive: I have learned at every
corner, that the ſcurvy is a popular diſeaſe,—that the bloody flux
cannot be cured by any of the faculty, except the gentlewoman at the blue
poſts in <hi>Haydon Yard,</hi>—that nervous diſeaſes were never
ſo frequent, <pb n="520" facs="tcp:1252700302:95"/> —and that the royal family and
moſt of our nobility are troubled with corns;—and many other curious
particulars of the ſame kind: I have alſo got a ſmattering of the
<hi>French</hi> language from the advertiſements of taylors and ſtaymakers,
and of Mrs. <hi>Dubois</hi>'s portable ſoop, in <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> I was completely grounded in politics by ſtopping at
<hi>Temple Bar</hi> every morning to read the <hi>Gazzetteer,</hi> which uſed
to be paſted up there to the great emolument of the hackney-coachmen upon
their ſtands. But above all, I have acquired the moſt ſublime notions of
religion by liſtening attentively to the ſpirited harangues of our moſt
eminent field-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and I confeſs myſelf highly obliged to the
itinerant miſſionaries of <hi>Weſlley, Whitefield,</hi> and
<hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> who have inſtructed us in the New Light from empty
barrels and joint-ſtools. Next to theſe, I have received great
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements from the vociferous retailers of poetry; as I conſtantly uſed
to thruſt myſelf into the circle gathered round them, and liſten to their
ditties, till I could carry away both words and tune. I have likewiſe got
ſome notion of the drama by attending the theatres; though my finances were
too ſcanty for me ever to get admittance into them. I therefore had
recourſe to the following practice: I would contrive to hear one act at the
outſide of one of the pit-doors; the next act I took my ſtand at the other;
and as the author generally riſes in the middle, I could catch the moſt
tearing parts during the third act in the paſſage to the two-ſhilling
gallery: in the fourth act the rants came tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loud to my ear at the
entrance of the upper gallery; and I very attentively liſtened to the
pathetic at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the play with the footmen in the lobby.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="521" facs="tcp:1252700302:96"/>ENDOWED with ſo much learning, you will
doubtleſs be curious to know to what purpoſes I have turned it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
before I could read at all, I got into the ſervice of a very eminent doctor
of phyſick, who employed me in ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his bills, and ſlipping them
ſlily into the hands of ſpindle-ſhanked young fellows, as they paſſed
by. After this, by cloſely ſtudying theſe elegant compoſitions, I got
together a ſufficient ſet of medical phraſes, which (by the help of
<hi>Bayley</hi>'s dictionary) enabled me to draw up bills and affidavits for
thoſe doctors, who were not ſo happy as to be able to write or read. I was
next promoted to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret of a printer of bloody murders, where my
buſineſs was to invent terrible ſtories, write <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>
tragedies, or Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas carrols, and occaſionally to put the Ordinary of
<hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>'s Account of Dying Speeches into lamentable rhyme. I was
afterwards concerned in works, that required a greater fund of erudition,
ſuch as bog-houſe miſcellanies, and little books for children; and I was
once engaged as the principal compiler of a two-penny magazine. Since that I
followed the occupation of an Eves-dropper, or Collector of News for the daily
papers; in which I turned a good penny by hunting after marriages and deaths,
and inventing lyes for the day. Once indeed, being out of other buſineſs, I
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the mean office of a ballad-ſinger, and hawked my own
verſes; but not having a good ear for muſic, and the tone of my voice being
rather inclined to whining, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted my ballads into penitential hymns, and
took up the vocation of Methodiſt Preacher. In this ſtation I made new
converts every day among the old women by my ſighs and groans, who in return
contributed their half-pence, which I diſpoſed of in charity—to
myſelf: but I was at laſt beat off the field by a journeyman ſhoe-maker,
who fairly out-whined <pb n="522" facs="tcp:1252700302:97"/> me; and finding myſelf deſerted
by my uſual audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I became Setter to a Fleet-parſon.</p>
                     <p>MY employment now was to take my ſtand at the end of
<hi>Fleet-Market,</hi> and whenever I ſaw any gaping young couple ſtaring
about them, to whiſper them ſoftly in the ear, and aſk them whether they
wanted to be married; aſſuring them withal, that ours was the only
marriage-booth in the fair. Whenever the ceremony was performed, I officiated
as clerk: and when my maſter the doctor died, I made a ſhift to purchaſe
his entire ſtock in trade, (conſiſting of a ruſty caſſock, an old
grizzle wig, and one lappet of a band) and ſucceeded him in his benefice of
the <hi>Hand-and-Pen Chapel.</hi> I now got a more comfortable
ſubſiſtance than many regularly ordained curates in the country: but the
marriage-act ſoon after taking place, I was flung out of employ; and as the
Primate of <hi>May-Fair,</hi> the reverend Dr. <hi>Keith,</hi> is forced to
ſell ſnuff in the Fleet-priſon, I have been obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail gin in a
night-cellar.</p>
                     <p>THUS, Mr. TOWN, have I ſet before you the progreſs I have
made in literature, as well as the particular circumſtances of my life, in
hopes they will induce you to the notice of the public. As the parliament has
not thought fit to make any proviſion for the poor diſtreſt Clergy of the
Fleet, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to open a New Oratory-Chapel in <hi>Fleet-market,</hi> to be
conducted on the ſame principles with that eſtabliſhed in
<hi>Clare-market</hi>; and for which, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall appear no
leſs qualified by my education, than the renowned <hi>Henley</hi> or any of
his butchers. I ſhall therefore beg leave to ſubſcribe myſelf, hoping

crazy frames together, we are obliged to attend to the calls of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and
ſatisfy the regular cravings of the appetite: Though it is, in truth, but a
very ſmall part of the world, that eat becauſe they are hungry, or drink
becauſe they are dry. The common day-labourer may, indeed, be glad to
ſnatch an haſty meal with his wife and children, that he may have
ſtrength to return to his work; and the porter finds it neceſſary to
refreſh himſelf with a full pot of entire butt, while he reſts his load
upon the bulk at the ale-houſe door: but thoſe, who have more leiſure to
ſtudy what they ſhall eat and drink, require ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing 
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:1252700302:99"/> more in their food, than what is barely wholſome or
neceſſary; their palates muſt be gratified with rich ſauces and
high-ſeaſoned delicacies; and they frequently have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to whetters
and provocatives, to anticipate the call of hunger, and to enable their
ſtomachs to bear the load they lay on it. There are a ſort of men, whoſe
chief pride is a good taſte (as they call it) and a great ſtomach: and the
whole buſineſs of their lives is included in their breakfaſt, dinner and
ſupper. Theſe people, of whatever rank and denomination, whether they
regale with turtle, or devour ſhoulders of mutton and peck-loaves for wagers,
whether a duke at <hi>White</hi>'s, or a chairman at the <hi>Blue-Poſts,</hi>
are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the number of thoſe, 
<q rend="inline">"whom nature, (as <hi>Salluſt</hi> tells us,)

               <p>THERE are many follies and vices, which men endeavour to hide
from the reſt of the world: but this, above all others, they take a pride in
proclaiming; and ſeem to run about with the cap and bells, as if they were
ambitious to be ranked among the Sons of Folly. Indeed, as the politeneſs of
the <hi>French</hi> language has diſtinguiſhed every glutton by the title
of <hi>Bon Vivant,</hi> and the courteſy of our own has honoured their
beaſtly gluttony by the name of <hi>Good Living,</hi> the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thinks to
eat and drink himſelf into your good opinion, and recommend himſelf to your
eſteem by an exquiſite bill of fare. However this may be, it is remarkable,
that as the fox-hunter takes delight in relating the incidents of the chace,
and kills the fox again over a bowl of punch at night, ſo the <hi>Bon
Vivant</hi> enjoys giving an account of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <pb n="525" facs="tcp:1252700302:100"/>
dinner, and chews the cud of reflection on ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

               <p>I HAVE been led into theſe thoughts by an acquaintance which I

ſpeaking, <hi>Table-Talk.</hi> His brain ſeems to be ſtuffed with an
hodge-podge of ideas, conſiſting of ſeveral diſhes, which he is
perpetually ſerving up for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terainment of the company. As it was ſaid
of <hi>Longinus,</hi> that he was a Walking Library, in the ſame manner I
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this gentleman as a Walking Larder: and as the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were ſaid to ſmell of the lamp, ſo my friend's
whole converſation ſavours of the kitchen. He even makes uſe of his
ſtomach as an artificial memory; and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects every place he has been at,
and every perſon he has ſeen, by ſome circumſtances relating to the
entertainment he met with. If he calls to mind any inn, he adds, 
<q rend="inline">"for there the cook ſpoiled a fine
turbot:"</q> another houſe is recollected, 
<q rend="inline">"becauſe the parſon took all the fat of the
haunch of veniſon:"</q> he remembers a gentleman you mention, 
<q rend="inline">"becauſe he had the ſmalleſt ſtomach he
ever knew;"</q> or one lady, 
<q rend="inline">"becauſe ſhe drank a great deal of wine at
ſupper;"</q> and another, 
<q rend="inline">"becauſe ſhe has the beſt receipt for
making her pickled cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers look green."</q>
               </p>
               <p>HIS paſſion for eating alſo influences all his actions,
diverſions, and ſtudies. He is fond of hare-hunting, as he ſays his
perſuit is animated by the hopes of ſeeing puſs ſmoking on the table;
but he wonders how any man can venture his neck in a chace after a fox, which,
when it is got, is not worth eating. He has had occaſion to viſit the 
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:1252700302:101"/> ſeveral Wells in this kingdom, which he conſiders,
not as places where perſons go to drink the waters, but where they go to eat;
and in this light he gives a character of them all. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Bath,</hi> ſays he, is one of the beſt
markets in the world: At <hi>Tunbridge</hi> you have fine mutton, and moſt
exquiſite wheat-ears: But at <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> pox take the place, you
have nothing but cow-beef, red veal, and white bacon."</q> He looks upon every
part of <hi>England</hi> in the ſame light; and would as ſoon go to
<hi>Cheſhire</hi> for butter, and <hi>Suffolk</hi> for cheeſe, as miſs
eating what each particular town or county is famous for having the moſt
excellent in its kind. He does not grudge to ride twenty miles to dine on a
favourite diſh; and it was but laſt week, that he appointed a friend in
<hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> to meet him at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"which (ſays he in his letter) is the beſt
place we can ſettle our buſineſs at, on account of thoſe excellent
rolls we may have for breakfaſt, and the delicious trout we are ſure to
have at dinner."</q>
               </p>
               <p>MR. CRAMWELL (for that is his name) is ſo unfortunate as to
want a purſe adequate to his taſte; ſo that he is put to ſeveral
ſhifts, and obliged to have recourſe to ſeveral arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to gratify
his appetite. For this purpoſe he has with great pains conſtituted a Club,
conſiſting of perſons moſt likely to promote Good Living. This Society
is compoſed of members, who are all of them of ſome trade that can
furniſh it with proviſions, (except one country ſquire, who ſupplies it
with game,) and they are obliged to ſend in the beſt of whatever their
trade deals in, at prime coſt: by which wiſe management the Club is
ſupplied with every delicacy the ſeaſons affords, at the moſt
reaſonable rates. Upon any vacancy much care and deliberation is uſed in 
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:1252700302:102"/> electing a new member. A candidate's being able to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a whole turkey with an equal proportion of chine, or eat one haunch of
veniſon with the fat of another as ſauce to it, would be no recommendation:
On the contrary; there was never more caution uſed, at the death of a Pope,
to elect a ſucceſſor who appears the moſt likely to be ſhort-lived,
than by this Society of <hi>Epicurean</hi> Hogs to admit nobody of a ſtomach
ſuperior to their own. Mr. CRAMWELL, on account of his extraordinary
profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Science of Eating, is honoured with the office of Caterer;
and has arrived to ſuch a pitch of accuracy in the calculation of what is
ſufficient, that he ſeems to gage the ſtomachs of the Club, as an
Exciſeman does a caſk: and when all the members are preſent, they
ſeldom ſend away three ounces of meat from the table. A Captain of a ſhip
trading to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> has been admitted an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary member,
having contracted to bring over as a preſent to them a ſufficient cargo of
turtle every voyage; and a few days ago I met CRAMWELL in prodigious high
ſpirits, when he told me, that he was the happieſt man in the world: 
<q rend="inline">"for now, ſays he, we ſhall have Ortolans as
plenty as pidgeons; for it was but yeſterday, that we balloted into our
ſociety one of the <hi>Flanderkin-Bird-Merchants.</hi>"</q> This
aſſociation for the preſervation of elegant fare gratifies my friend
CRAMWELL's luxury at a cheap rate: and that he may make as many good meals as
poſſible, he often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives to introduce himſelf to the tables of
perſons of quality. This he effects by ſending my lord or her ladyſhip a
preſent of a <hi>Bath Cheeſe,</hi> a <hi>Ruff</hi> or <hi>Land-Rail</hi>
from his friends in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> or <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi>
which ſeldom fails to procure him an invitation to dinner. It once happened,
that dining <pb n="528" facs="tcp:1252700302:103"/> with an Alderman his appetite got the better
of his good-breeding, when he ſhaved off all the outſide of a
plumb-pudding; and he has ever ſince been talked of in the city by the name
of SKIN-PUDDING.</p>
               <p>AS all his joy and miſery conſtantly ariſes from his
belly, he thinks it is the ſame with others; and I heard him aſk a perfect
ſtranger to him, who complained that he was ſick, whether he had over-eat
himſelf. It is no wonder, that CRAMWELL ſhould be ſometimes troubled with
the gout: I called upon him the other morning, and found him with his legs
wrapped up in flannel, and a book lying open before him upon the table. On
aſking him what he was reading, he told me he was <hi>taking phyſic</hi>;
and on enquiring whoſe advice he had, 
<q rend="inline">"Oh, ſays he, nobody can do me ſo much good
as Mrs. <hi>Hannah Glaſſe.</hi> I am here going through a courſe of her
<hi>Art of Cookery,</hi> in hopes to get a ſtomach: for indeed, my dear
friend, (added he, with tears in his eyes) my appetite is quite gone; and I am
ſure I ſhall die, if I do not find ſomething in this book, which I think
I can eat."</q>

            <epigraph>
               <q> 
                  <l>—Fuit haud ignobilis Argis,</l>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ORACE, in the paſſage quoted at the head of my paper,
tells us (after <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) of a man, who uſed to ſit in the
empty theatre, and fancy that he ſaw real exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions on the ſtage. We
have the like account in another ancient author, of a perſon that uſed to
wait with great ſollicitude the coming in of ſhips into 
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:1252700302:105"/> the harbour, believing them to be his own property. The
end of theſe madmen was alſo ſimilar: they were both cured; and both
complained, that they were deprived of the ſatisfaction which they before
enjoyed from a pleaſing error of their minds.</p>
               <p>THAT the happineſs and miſery of the far greateſt part of
mankind depends upon the fancy, need not be inſiſted on: <hi>Crede
quòd habes et babes,</hi> Think that you have and you have, is a maxim
not confined to thoſe only within the walls of <hi>Bedlam.</hi> I remember an
humouriſt, who would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently divert himſelf in the ſame manner with
the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men above-mentioned, and ſupply his real wants by the force of his
imagination. He would go round the markets, and ſuppoſe himſelf to be
cheapening the moſt dainty proviſions; and when he came home to his
ſcanty meal, by the ſame ideal contrivance he would convert his trotters
into turbot, and his ſmall beer into the moſt delicious Burgundy. As he was
a barber by trade, he would put on the air and manners of his cuſtomers,
while he combed out their wigs: with every bag he would conceive himſelf
going to court or a ridotto; and once, when he was ſick, he got together
three or four of the largeſt tyes, placed them upon blocks round his
bed-ſide, and called them a conſultation of phyſicians.</p>
               <p>BUT of all others, there are none perhaps, who are more obliged
to the imagination for their ideal happineſs, than the fraternity of which I
am an unworthy member. There is no ſet of people, who are more ambitious to
appear grand in the world, and yet have leſs means, than thoſe gentlemen
whom the world has ſtiled Authors. Wit and pride as often 
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:1252700302:106"/> go hand in hand together as wit and poverty: but though
the generality of writers are by the frowns of fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from
poſſeſſing a profuſe ſhare of the good things of this world, they
are abundantly recompenced by enjoying them in ſpeculation. They indulge in
golden dreams, at the time that they have not ſixpence in their pockets, and
conjure up all the luxuries of <hi>Pontac</hi>'s before them, though they are
at a loſs perhaps where to get a dinner. Thus a Critic by a kind of magic
will tranſport himſelf to the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres in an imaginary gilt chariot, and
be ſeated at once in the front-boxes; when in reality he has waited for two
hours in <hi>Vinegar-Yard</hi> before the opening of the doors, to ſecure to
himſelf a corner in the twelve-penny gallery. Hence it alſo happens to
moſt Authors, that though their way of life be ever ſo mean, their writings
favour of the moſt unbounded magnificence; and as they have nothing to
beſtow, a moſt ſurpriſing generoſity always accompanies every action
of the quill. Thus a Novelliſt, for example, is remarkably laviſh of his
caſh on all occaſions; and ſpares no expence in carrying on the deſigns
of his perſonages through ever ſo many volumes. Nothing, indeed, is more
eaſy than to be very profuſe upon paper: An author, when he is about it,
may erect his airy caſtles to what height he pleaſes, and with a wave of
his pen may command the mines of <hi>Peru:</hi> and as he deals about his money
without once untying his purſe-ſtrings, it will coſt him the ſame
whether he throws away a mite or a million; and another dip of ink, by the
addition of two or three <hi>gratis</hi> cyphers, may in an inſtant convert a
ſingle ten into as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. We muſt not therefore be
ſurpriſed, that the heroes of our modern novels ſeem to poſſeſs the
Purſe of <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> 
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:1252700302:107"/> as their writers have
all of them the power of his Wiſhing-cap.</p>
               <p>BUT it muſt be confeſſed, that we Eſſay-writers, as we
are the greateſt <hi>Egotiſts,</hi> are conſequently moſt vain and
oſtentatious. As we frequently find occaſion to prate about ourſelves, we
take abundant care to put the reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in mind of our importance.
It is very well known, that we keep the beſt company, are preſent at the
moſt expenſive places of diverſion, and can talk as familiarly of
<hi>White</hi>'s, as if we had been admitted to the honour of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an
eſtate there. Though the neceſſaries as well as the luxuries of life may
perhaps be denied us, we readily make up for the want of them by the creative
power of the imagination. Thus, for inſtance, I remember a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Eſſayiſt, who took a particular pride in dating his lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations,
<hi>From my own Apartment</hi>; which he repreſented as abounding with every
convenience: though at the ſame time he was working three ſtories from the
ground, and was often forced to ſcribble upon wrappers of tobacco for want of
other paper. As to myſelf, I make no doubt but the reader has long ago
diſcovered without my telling him, that I loll at my eaſe in a crimſon
velvet chair, reſt my elbow on the poliſhed ſurface of a mahogany table,
write my eſſays upon gilt paper, and dip my pen into a ſilver
ſtandiſh.</p>
               <p>Indeed, though I have taken upon me the Title of a CONNOISSEUR,
I ſhall not preſume to boaſt, that I am poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a
<hi>Muſaeum</hi> like <hi>Sloane</hi>'s, or a Library equal to
<hi>Mead</hi>'s. But as <hi>Pliny,</hi> and after him our countryman Mr.
<hi>Pope,</hi> have left us a deſcription of their elegant <hi>Villa,</hi> I
hope <pb n="533" facs="tcp:1252700302:108"/> it will not be thought arrogance in me (after what
I have ſaid,) if I ſet before the reader an account of my own STUDY. This
is a little edifice ſituated at a ſmall diſtance from the reſt of the
houſe, for the ſake of privacy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. It is an ancient pile of
building, and hangs over a ſmall rivulet, which runs underneath it; and as
the entrance into it is ſhaded by a thick hedge of ever-greens, which caſt
a kind of awful gloom about it, ſome learned antiquarians have been led to
conjecture, that it was formerly a Temple (or rather Chapel of Eaſe,)
dedicated to one of the heathen Goddeſſes. This Goddeſs, they inform me,
was worſhipped by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was probably held in no leſs
veneration by the <hi>Aegyptians, Chaldees, Syrians,</hi> and other nations.
However this be, the walls on the inſide are deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with various
inſcriptions alluding to the religious rites performed there, and hung round
with the rude rhymes of ancient bards.</p>
               <p>TO this STUDY I retire conſtantly every morning after
breakfaſt, and at other parts of the day, as occaſions call. Here I am at
liberty to indulge my meditations unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, as I ſuffer no one to break
in upon my privacy; and (what will perhaps ſurpriſe my readers) I find in
myſelf the greateſt inclination to viſit it after an hearty meal. In this
place I have made a very rapid progreſs in literature, and have gone through
ſeveral very learned volumes, which otherwiſe I ſhould never have looked
into. I have here travelled leaf by leaf through the works of many worthy, but
neglected ancient divines, critics, and politicians; and have turned over many
a modern pamphlet or poem with equal ſatisfaction. I muſt not forget to
mention, that (like the ſcrupulous <hi>Mahometans)</hi> I have often picked
up the <pb n="534" facs="tcp:1252700302:109"/> fragments of ſeveral learned writers, which
have come from the chandlers, and lodged them, among others no leſs
valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in my STUDY.</p>
               <p>I MAY ſafely boaſt, that I am indebted for many of my beſt
thoughts in the courſe of theſe papers to the reflections I have had the
leiſure to make in this STUDY; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably has the ſame influence on my
mind, as the ſtew'd prunes, which <hi>Bayes</hi> tells us he always took when
he wrote. But if my STUDY ſerves to inſpire me ſometimes with agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eable
ideas, it never fails on the other hand to remind me of the mortality of
writers; as it affords repeated proofs, that we may juſtly ſay of our
works, as well as of ourſelves,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OING the other day to viſit Mrs. <hi>Penelope Doat,</hi>
after I had waited ſome time in the parlour, the maid returned with her
miſtreſs's compliments, and informed me, that as ſhe was extremely
buſy, ſhe begged to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed coming down to me, but that ſhe would
be very glad to ſee me in the <hi>Nurſery.</hi> As I knew ſhe was a
maiden lady, I was a good deal ſtartled at the meſſage; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I
followed the ſervant up ſtairs to her miſtreſs; whom I 
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:1252700302:111"/> found combing a little white dog that lay in her lap,
with a grey parrot perched on one arm of the ſettee where ſhe ſat, a
monkey on the back, and a tabby cat with half a dozen kittens in the other
corner. The whole room, which was a very large one, was indeed a Nurſery for
all kinds of animals, except thoſe of the human ſpecies: It was hung every
where with cages, containing parrots, mackaws, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary birds, nightingales,
linnets, goldfinches, &amp;c. on the chairs were ſeveral cats repoſing on
ſoft cuſhions; and there were little kennels, in the <hi>Chineſe</hi>
taſte, in almoſt every corner of the room, filled with Pugs, Fidos, and
King <hi>Charles</hi>'s breed. As ſoon as the chattering of the birds, the
barking of the dogs, and the mewing of the cats, which my entrance
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, began to ceaſe, 
<q rend="inline">"You find me here, Sir, (ſaid the lady)
tending my little family, the only joy of my life: Here's a dear pretty
creature (holding up the dog ſhe was combing) a beauty! ſir, a fine
long-eared ſnub-noſed beauty! Lady <hi>Faddle</hi> advertiſed three
quarters of a year, and cold not get the fellow to it. Ah, bleſs it, and love
it, ſweet ſoul!"</q>—And then ſhe ſtroaked it, and kiſſed it
for near two minutes, uttering the whole time all thoſe inarticulate
ſounds, which cannot be committed to paper, and which are only addreſſed
to Dogs, Cats, and Children, and may be ſtiled the language of the Nurſery.
Upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving me ſmile, at the embraces ſhe beſtowed on her little
motley darling, 
<q rend="inline">"I am afraid (ſaid ſhe) you don't love
theſe pretty creatures. How can you be ſo cruel? Poor <hi>dumb</hi> things!
I would not have them hurt for all the world: nor do I ſee why a lady
ſhould not indulge herſelf in having ſuch ſweet little company about
her, as well as you men run out eſtates in keeping a pack of filthy 
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1252700302:112"/> hounds."</q> Then ſhe laid <hi>Pompey</hi> on his
cuſhion by the fire-ſide, and railed at the barbarity of the human
ſpecies to the reſt of the creation, and entered into a long
diſſertation on tenderneſs and humanity.</p>
               <p>A HUMANE diſpoſition is, indeed ſo amiable either in man
or woman, that it ought always to be cheriſhed and kept alive in our
boſoms; but at the ſame time we ſhould be cautious not to render the
firſt virtue of our nature ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. The moſt compaſſionate temper
may be ſufficiently gratified by relieving the wretches of our own ſpecies:
but who would ever boaſt of their generoſity to a lap-dog, and their
conferring eternal obligations on a monkey? or would any perſon deſerve to
be celebrated for their charity, who ſhould deny ſupport to a relation or a
friend, becauſe he maintains a litter of kittens? For my part, before I would
treat a <hi>Dutch</hi> puppy with ſuch abſurd fondneſs, I muſt be
brought to worſhip dogs, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did of old; and e'er I
would ſo extravagantly doat upon a monkey, I would (as <hi>Iago</hi> ſays
on a different occaſion) 
<q rend="inline">"change my huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with a baboon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>YET there have been many inſtances, beſides my female
friend, of this fondneſs for the brute creation being carried to very
ridiculous lengths. The grave doctors of the faculty have been called in to
feel the pulſe of a lap-dog, and inſpect the urine of a ſquirrel: nay, I
am myſelf acquainted with a lady, who carried this matter ſo far, as to
diſcharge her chaplain, becauſe he refuſed to bury her monkey. But the
moſt ſolemn piece of mummery on theſe occaſions is the making
proviſions for theſe animals by will; which abſurd legacies as little
deſerve the title of humanity, as thoſe people <pb n="538" facs="tcp:1252700302:113"/> merit
being called charitable, who in a death-bed fright ſtarve their relations, by
leaving their eſtates to found an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. It were indeed to be wiſhed,
that money left in truſt for ſuch uſes were ſubject to ſome ſtatute
of <hi>Mortmain</hi>; or at leaſt that the gentlemen of the long robe, would
contrive ſome ſcheme to cut off the entail from Monkeys, Mackaws,
<hi>Italian</hi> Greyhounds, and Tabby Cats.</p>
               <p>THAT a ſtage coachman ſhould love his cattle better than his
wife and children, or a country ſquire be fond of his hounds and hunters, is
not ſo ſurpriſing, becauſe the reaſon of their regard for them is
eaſily accounted for; and a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>captain has, upon the ſame principles,
been known to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an affection for his ſhip: but no coachman would,
like <hi>Caligula,</hi> tye his horſes to a golden rack, but thinks he
ſhews ſufficient kindneſs by filling them with good wholeſome
provender; and the country ſportſman takes care to provide his hounds with
a good kennel and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh, but would never think of placing them on
cuſhions before the fire, and feeding them with fricaſees, or breed them
with as much care as the heir to his eſtate. This irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular paſſion (if
I may ſo call it) is moſt frequently to be met with among the ladies. How
often has the ſlighted gallant envied the careſſes given to a lap-dog, or
kiſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on a ſquirrel! and 
<q rend="inline">"I would I were thy bird!"</q> has been the fond
exclamation of many a <hi>Romeo.</hi> But it is remarkable, that this affection
for birds and beaſts generally wears off after marriage, and that the ladies
diſcard their four-footed darlings and feathered favourites, when they can
beſtow their endearments on an huſband. Wherefore, theſe dry nurſes to
Puggs and Grimalkins are moſtly to be met with among thoſe females, who
have been diſappointed <pb n="539" facs="tcp:1252700302:114"/> in the affairs of love, and
have againſt their will retained the flower of virginity till it has withered
in their poſſeſſion. It often happens, that there is ſome kind of
analogy between the gallant they once loved, and the animal on which they
afterwards fix their affections: and I myſelf remember an inſtance of a
lady's paſſion for a lawyer being converted into dotage on a parrot; and
have an old maiden aunt, who once languiſhed for a beau, whoſe heart is now
devoted to a monkey.</p>
               <p>BUT I ſhould not ſo much quarrel with theſe humane ladies,
who chuſe to ſettle their affections on the brute ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, if they were
not troubleſome to others, who are not ſo ſenſible of the charms of a
ſnub noſe, or can diſcover any beauty in the grey eyes of a cat. A
doating mother would never forgive you, if you did not call her brat a fine
child, and dangle it about, and prattle with it, with as much ſeeming rapture
as herſelf: and in like manner, a lady would take it as an affront to her own
perſon, if you did not pay your adreſſes equally to her pug or her
parroquet. I know a young fellow, that was cut off with a ſhilling by an old
maiden aunt, becauſe he gave poor <hi>Veny</hi> a kick only for lifting up
his leg againſt the gentleman's ſtocking: and I have heard of another, who
might have carried off a very rich widow, but that he could not prevail upon
himſelf to extend his careſſes to her dormouſe. Indeed, I cannot help
thinking, that the embraces and endearments beſtowed on theſe rivals of the
human ſpecies ſhould be as private as the moſt ſecret intrigues; and I
would have lap-dogs, like fretful and ſqualling children, confined to bark
and growl only in the Nurſery. We may often ſee a footman following his
lady to church with a common prayer-book under one arm <pb n="540" facs="tcp:1252700302:115"/> a
dog under the other: I have alſo known a grave divine forced to ſtop
ſhort in the middle of a prayer, while the whole congregation has been
raiſed from their knees to attend to the howling of a lap-dog: and I once
ſaw a tragedy monarch diſturbed in his laſt moments, as he lay expiring
on the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, by a little black dog of king <hi>Charles</hi>'s breed, who
jumped out of the ſtage-box, and ſeizing upon the hero's perriwig, brought
it off in his mouth, and lodged it in his lady's lap.</p>
               <p>IT will not appear ſtrange, after what has been ſaid, that
theſe ladies (or lady-like gentlemen) ſhould be as ſollicitous to
preſerve the breed of their favourite animals, as a ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his
hounds and horſes. I have known a gentleman in St. <hi>James</hi>'s ſtreet
ſend his little <hi>Cupid</hi> in a ſedan chair as far as
<hi>Groſvenor</hi> ſquare to wait upon a lady's <hi>Veny</hi> for this very
purpoſe: and I ſhall never forget a Card, which was ſent to another lady
on a like occaſion, expreſſed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing terms.— 
<q rend="inline">"Mr. —'s compliments to Lady <hi>Betty
—,</hi> is glad to hear Miſs <hi>Chloe</hi> is ſafely delivered, and
begs it as a particular favour, that her ladyſhip would be pleaſed to SET

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we conſider that part of our acquaintance, whom we
remember from their infancy, we ſhall find, that the expectations we once
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of their future abilities are in many inſtances diſappointed.
Thoſe, who were accounted heavy dull boys, have by diligence and application
made their way to the firſt honours, and become eminent for their learning
and knowledge of the world; while others who were regarded as bright lads, and
imagined to poſſeſs parts equal to any ſcheme of life, have turned out
diſſolute and ignorant; and quite unworthy the title of a Genius, except in
the modern acceptation of the word, by which <pb n="542" facs="tcp:1252700302:117"/> it
ſignifies a very ſilly young fellow, who from his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and
debauchery has obtained the name of a Genius, (like <hi>lucus a non
lucendo)</hi> becauſe he has no Genius at all.</p>
               <p>IT is a ſhocking draw-back from a father's happineſs, when
he ſees his ſon bleſſed with ſtrong natural parts and quick
conception, to reflect that theſe very talents may be his ruin. If vanity
once gets into his head and gives it a wrong turn, the young coxcomb will
neglect the means of improvement, truſt entirely to his native abilities, and
be as ridiculouſly proud of his parts, as the brats of quality are taught to
be of their family. In the mean time thoſe, whom nature threw far behind him,
are by application enabled to leave him at a diſtance in their turn; and he
continues boaſting of his Genius, till it ſubſiſts no longer, but dies
for want of cultivation. Thus vanity and indolence prevents his improvement,
and if he is to riſe in the world by his merit, takes away the means of
ſucceſs, and perhaps reduces him to very miſerable diſtreſſes. I
know one of theſe early Geniuſes, who ſcarce ſupports himſelf by
writing for a bookſeller; and another, who is at leiſure to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
his extraordinary parts in the Fleet-priſon.</p>
               <p>IF we look into the world, we ſhall find that the mere Genius
will never raiſe himſelf to any degree of eminence without a cloſe and
unwearied application to his reſpective buſineſs or profeſſion. The
Inns of Court are full of theſe men of parts, who cannot bear the drudgery of
turning over dry Caſes and Reports; but, though they appear ever ſo
eloquent in taverns and coffee-houſes, not the neareſt relation will
truſt them with a Brief: And many a ſprightly phyſician has walked on
foot all his life, with no more <pb n="543" facs="tcp:1252700302:118"/> knowledge of his
profeſſion than what lies in his perriwig. For whatever opinion they
themſelves may have of their own parts, other perſons do not chuſe to be
bantered out of their eſtates, or joked out of their lives: And even in
trade, the plodding men of the Alley would foretell the bankruptcy of any wit
among them, who ſhould laugh at the labour of Accounts, or deſpiſe the
<hi>Italian</hi> Method of Book-keeping. Thus we ſee, that parts alone are
not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to recommend us to the good opinion of the world: and even
theſe, if not rouſed and called forth by ſtudy and application, would
become torpid and uſeleſs: as the race<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, though not put to drag a
dray or carry a pack, muſt yet be kept in exerciſe. But I ſhall enlarge
no further on this ſubject, as I would not anticipate the thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the following elegant little Fable; which (as my correſpondent informs me)
is written by the ſame ingenious hand, that obliged the public with the

GOOD MAN. By this, one would imagine, ſhould be underſtood an honeſt,
virtuous, and religious perſon: but to look for a GOOD MAN, in this ſtrict
acceptation of the phraſe, among the men of faſhion, would be as vain a
ſearch as that of <hi>Diogenes</hi> with his lanthorn in open day-light. This
appellation is, indeed, very familiarly uſed among the gentlemen of
<hi>'Change Alley:</hi> but there it is meant only to ſignify a <hi>Rich</hi>
man. He is there called a GOOD MAN, who is able to anſwer a bill at ſight,
though he is known to be ever ſo great a cheat. So by the ſame
unaccountable phraſeology, a ſcoundrel with a large eſtate is entitled a
<hi>Man of Worth</hi>: as among rakes the HONEST fellow may be the moſt

                     <p>BY the ſame figure, the GOOD FELLOW is he, who at a Country
Wake can ſoil the beſt wreſtler, break moſt heads, and challenge the
ring; take <hi>Broughton</hi> by the noſe; bid defiance to the
<hi>Clare-Market</hi> butchers; knock down the conſtables and watch, in
beating the rounds in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>; bilk the waiter, and kick the
bully out of doors in the hundreds of <hi>Drury</hi>; carry off his ſix
bottles of port at a ſitting; or drink October, till he leaves the country
ſquire and the parſon on the floor.</p>
                     <p>AS to the other ſex, the term GOOD WOMAN is applied, as a
mere expletive without any meaning, to the poor only, or perhaps to get rid of
the importunity of a beggar. In the country, indeed, a GOOD LADY is ſometimes
mentioned with a ſneer or as a term of reproach; and means one, who is ſo
old-faſhioned, as to go to church, ſay her prayers, <pb n="549" facs="tcp:1252700302:124"/>
and convert her dreſſing room into an apothecary's ſhop. But I would
aſk any well-bred lady, if ſhe would be content to baniſh herſelf from
the delights of the theatre, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, maſquerades, routs, drums,
aſſemblies, and the dear card-table, to be confined to the country, have
prayers in her own houſe twice a day, and do charitable offices to her poor
neighbours, merely to acquire the ridiculous reputation of a GOOD LADY.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL proceed next to conſider what is generally
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a GOOD EDUCATION. This is not to be found in either of our
Univerſities: nor is any learning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge implied in it, except what is
called the <hi>Knowledge of the World,</hi> which cannot be attained among
pedants, or gathered from muſty books. Common lads may be laſhed through a
grammar-ſchool, and afterwards locked up in colleges: but young fellows of
taſte and ſpirit have better opportunities of improving themſelves by
mixing with the town and the <hi>beau monde.</hi> For this reaſon they are
intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced very early into thoſe excellent Seminaries of GOOD EDUCATION
about <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and placed under the tuition of <hi>Haddock,
Douglaſs, Harris,</hi> &amp;c. It is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to ground them in
the genteel principles of infidelity and free-thinking, that they ſhould
attend the diſputations at the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> and the lectures of the
<hi>Clare-market</hi> Orator: and it would not be amiſs, if they were to get
a little notion of the modern Art of Criticiſm by frequenting the
<hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>George</hi>'s coffee-houſes. After this it is
proper, to compleat their education, that they ſhould make the tour of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; which will not fail to inſpire them with
the laudable love of every thing that is foreign, and a thorough contempt for
their own country. <pb n="550" facs="tcp:1252700302:125"/> Nothing now remains but to inſtruct
them in the noble Science of Gaming; for which purpoſe it has been found
expedient to conſtitute an Academy at <hi>White</hi>'s; where it is taught in
all it's branches. The conſequences of ſuch a GOOD EDUCATION, as is here
ſet down, may be ſeen in many inſtances: Some have been enabled by it to
ruin their conſtitutions, and others to run out their eſtates. Some have
received the finiſhing ſtroke of a GOOD EDU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION at <hi>Tyburn,</hi>
while others have given ſufficient proofs of it by being gallantly run
through the body in a duel, or genteelly ſhooting themſelves through the
head.</p>
                     <p>LET us now take a view of the GOOD EDUCATION, which is at
preſent in vogue among the fair ſex. As the GOOD LADIES of former days were
deſirous, that their daughters ſhould make GOOD WIVES, they thought the
firſt ſtep towards it was to make them GOOD HOUSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WIVES. They therefore
bred them up in the domeſtic arts of pickling, preſerving, diſtilling
ſimple waters, and the like: they alſo taught them to work at their needle,
write, caſt accounts, and read a chapter in the Bible or ſome other Good
BOOK, as they are ridiculouſly oalled. But this method of education has been
found to be fit only for low girls deſigned to go to ſervice, or poor
parſons daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that muſt come to be milliners, or ſomething worſe.
As to ladies of faſhion, to learn <hi>Engliſh</hi> would only obſtruct
their advancement in the <hi>French</hi> language, which they are taught to
<hi>ſpeak</hi> from their infancy, but never to read: beſides, they will
get a better knowledge of their mother tongue from the peculiar dialects uſed
at routes and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and the ſpirited converſations carried on at
maſquerades and other public places, than they could poſſibly do from 
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:1252700302:126"/> books. All the writing required is to be able to
ſcrawl out a billet-doux; for which we muſt alſo own, that
ſpelling-books are of no ſervice: and working we know would hurt their eyes
no leſs than reading: As to religion, honour, virtue, charity, and the like
old-faſhioned cant, nobody would think of ſtuffing any girl's head with it,
above the degree of a chambermaid.</p>
                     <p>THE preſent notion of a GOOD Education was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
unknown to the females of former ages; as, beſides the uſual
accompliſhments of dancing, or the like, it will be found to conſiſt in
the knowledge of Intriguing, Dreſs, and (I may add too) the Card-table. In
the firſt of theſe particulars they conſtantly receive leſſons from
the milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, mantua-makers, and maid-ſervants; and by being carried about
to all public places of diverſion, they ſoon become proficients in the
ſciences. The ſame tutors like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take care to inſtruct their young
pupils in the Art of Dreſs; and I have known a little miſs, by the time
ſhe was arrived at her teens, ſo nice an adept in face-painting, as to
apply the <hi>rouge</hi> to her pretty cheeks with as much elegance and
propriety as her mamma. To conclude, when a young lady has got <hi>Hoyle</hi>'s
rules by heart, and is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to play a rubbers at a Sunday route, it is a
ſure mark of her having had a compleat GOOD EDUCATION.</p>
                     <p>THERE are many other inſtances, in which this word GOOD is
perverted to a very prepoſterous ſenſe. Thus GOOD LIVING is made to
ſignify the practice of no other excellence, but what conſiſts in Good
Eating and Drinking: but as you have formerly given us the character of one of
theſe GOOD LIVERS, I ſhall only take notice, that the ill 
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:1252700302:127"/> humours conſequent of their luxury and intemperance,
which ſhew themſelves in blotches and breakings out on their faces, are
emphatically called their <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> In like manner, by GOOD BLOOD we
are taught to underſtand a gentility of birth: and though a nobleman be ever
ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for his vices, or though his anceſtors have been raiſed by
the vileſt means, his poſterity always pride themſelves on the GOOD BLOOD
of the family. I would not be thought to quibble about words, when I obſerve,
that the moſt ſhocking and blaſphemous ridicule on the ſacred tenets of
our religion (though without the leaſt ſhadow of wit) is by the preſent
ſhallow race of free-thinkers applauded as a GOOD JOKE. The moſt cruel and
unmanly actions are by our Bucks and Bloods ſet down under the ſame
denomination: and if blaſphemy and profaneneſs is a GOOD JOKE, a rape or a
murder is upon the ſame pinciples eſteemed a very GOOD THING.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>RINKING is one of thoſe popular vices, which moſt people
reckon among their venial failings, and it is thought no great blot on a man's
character, to ſay he takes his glaſs rather too freely. But as thoſe
vices are moſt dangerous and likely to prevail, which if not approved are at
leaſt excuſed by moſt people, I have been tempted to examine, whether
Drinking really deſerves that quarter it receives from the generality of
mankind: and I <pb n="554" facs="tcp:1252700302:129"/> muſt own, that after a ſtrict
attention to the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that induce men to become hard-drinkers, as
well as to the conſequences which ſuch exceſſes produce, I am at a
loſs to account for the received maxim that 
<q rend="inline">"in good wine there is truth;"</q> and ſhould
no more expect happineſs in a full bowl, than chaſtity in the bar of a
tavern.</p>
               <p>THE incentives to this practice are ſome of them very
ſhocking, and ſome very ridiculous; as will perhaps appear from the
following characters. Poor <hi>Heartly</hi> was bleſt with every noble
qualification of the head and heart, and bade fair for the love and admiration
of the world, but was unfortunately bound in a very large ſum for a friend,
who diſappeared, and left him to the mercy of the law. The diſtreſſes,
thus brought upon him by the treachery of another, threw him into the deepeſt
deſpair, and he had at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to drinking, to benumb (if
poſſible) the very ſenſe of reflection. He is miſerable when ſober,
and when drunk ſtupified and muddled: His misfortunes have robbed him of all
the joys of life, and he is now endeavouring wilfully to put an end to them by
a ſlow death.</p>
               <p>TOM BUCK, from the firſt day that he was put into breeches,
was always accounted a boy of ſpirit: and before he reached the top of
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſchool, knew the names and faces of the moſt noted
girls upon town, toſſed off his claret with a ſmack, and had a long tick
at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. When he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he eſpouſed the Tory
party, becauſe they drank deepeſt; and he has for ſome years been
accounted a four-bottle man. He drank for fame, and has ſo well
eſtabliſhed his character, that he was never known to ſend a man from his
chambers ſober, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally laid his whole company under the table. Since
his <pb n="555" facs="tcp:1252700302:130"/> leaving the univerſity, nobody ever acquired more
reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Electioneering; for he can <hi>ſee out</hi> the ſtouteſt
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder in <hi>England</hi>: He has, indeed, ſwallowed many a tun in the
ſervice of his country, and is now a ſounder pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot by two bottles than
any man in the county.</p>
               <p>POOR <hi>Wou'd-be</hi> became a debauchée through mere
baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and a fooliſh ſort of modeſty, that has made many a man
drunk in ſpite of his teeth. He contracted an acquaintance with a ſet of
hard drinkers, and though he would as ſoon chuſe to ſwallow a doſe of
phyſic, has not courage to refuſe his bumper. He is drunk every night, and
always ſick to death the next morning, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſolves, to
drink nothing ſtronger than ſmall beer for the future; but at night the
poor fellow gets drunk again through downright modeſty. Thus
<hi>Wou'd-be</hi> ſuffers himſelf to be preſt into the ſervice; and
ſince he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a jolly fellow is become one of the moſt
miſerable wretches upon earth.</p>
               <p>HONEST <hi>Ned Brimmer</hi> is at preſent the moſt diſmal
object that ever fell a ſacrifice to liquor. It was unluckily his firſt
ambition to promote what is uſually called Good Fellowſhip: In this
undertaking he has in a very few years entirely ruined his conſtitution, and
now ſtalks up and down in ſo piteous a condition, as might inſpire his
companions with more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflections than an empty bottle. He has quite
loſt all appetite; and he is now obliged to keep up a weak arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial heat
in his body, by the ſame means that deſtroyed the natural warmth of his
conſtitution. Rum, brandy, and uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebaugh are his diet-drinks, and he may
perhaps linger a few months, before he falls a martyr to Good Fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="556" facs="tcp:1252700302:131"/>HAVING thus taken a ſhort view of the
unhappy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that induce men to become hard-drinkers, few perhaps will
think ſuch reaſons any recommendation to Drunkenneſs: nor can I imagine
they will grow more fond of it, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what ſtrange creatures they
are during their intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> calls it 
<q rend="inline">"putting a devil into their mouths to ſteal
away their brains;"</q> and indeed a cup too much turns a man the wrong ſide
out; and wine, at the ſame time it takes away the power of ſtanding from
the legs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the mind of all ſenſe and reflection. It is whimſical
enough to conſider the different effects, which wine produces on different
tempers. Sometimes, like love, it makes a fool ſenſible, and a wiſe man
an aſs; and ſeems to imbibe a new quality from every different body, as
water takes a tincture from the ground it runs through.</p>
               <p>HORACE has with great pleaſantry recapitulated the various
effects of wine in a ſtanza, which I have placed at the head of this paper.
One man grows maudlin and weeps; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becomes merry and facetious; a third
quarrels, throws a bottle at his companion's head, and could run his deareſt
friend through the body; a fourth is mad for a girl, and falls in love with a
ſtreet-walker, or an old woman roaſting cheſnuts; while to a fifth, the
liquor ſerves as an opiate, and lulls him to ſleep. <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>
has alſo ſhewn this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of characters with great humour.
<hi>Caſſio</hi> crys, 
<q rend="inline">"let's to buſineſs,"</q> and immediately
begins to hiccup out his prayers, and belches out his hopes of ſalvation:
Juſtice <hi>Silence,</hi> who does not ſpeak a word while he is ſober,
has no ſooner ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the rouzing cup, than he roars out a catch, and
grows the noiſieſt man in the company. It is reported to have been one of
the moſt exquiſite entertainments to the <pb n="557" facs="tcp:1252700302:132"/> choice
ſpirits in the beginning of this century, to get <hi>Addiſon</hi> and
<hi>Steele</hi> together in company for the evening. <hi>Steele</hi>
enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them till he was tipſy; when the ſame wine that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
him, only ſerved to elevate <hi>Addiſon,</hi> who took up the ball juſt
as <hi>Steele</hi> dropt it, and kept it up for the reſt of the evening. They
who have never been preſent at a ſcene of this kind may ſee the whole
group of drunken characters, diſplayed at one view with infinite humour, in
<hi>Hogarth's Modern Midnight Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THUS exceſs of drinking verifies all the transformations
recorded in the fable of <hi>Circe</hi>'s cup; and perhaps the true reaſon
why <hi>Bacchus</hi> is always painted with horns, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that wine
turns men into beaſts. Indeed, if none were to indulge themſelves in
drinking, except thoſe who, like <hi>Steele</hi> and <hi>Addiſon,</hi>
could be witty and agreeable in their cups, the number of hard-drinkers would
be very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diminiſhed. Moſt men have ſo little right to plead an
excuſe of this ſort in vindication of their drunkenneſs, that wine either
makes them very rude, very ſtupid, or very mad. It is a vulgar error to
ſuppoſe that liquor only ſhews ill qualities, ſince it alſo
frequently creates them; and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders notions in the mind quite foreign to
its natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are the mere effects of wine, and break
out, like blotches and carbuncles on the face. The diſguſtful appearance,
which moſt people make when they are drunk, was what induced the
<hi>Spartans</hi> to intoxicate their ſlaves, and ſhew them to their
children, in order to deter them from ſo odious a vice: In like manner let
the Choice Spirit, who is often ſeen hanging his head over the pot, or
ſnoring in an armed-chair in a tavern, reflect what a ſhocking figure he
muſt have made, when he ſees the drunken beggar ſleeping on a bulk, or
rolling in the kennel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:1252700302:133"/>WHOEVER thus conſiders the motives that
generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to give into theſe exceſſes, and how ridiculous and
unhappy they are often rendered by the effects, will hardly be tempted by the
charms of a bottle: and, indeed, Hard-Drinking is frequently one, among the
many evils, that ariſe from want of education. The dull ſquire, ſettled
in the country, who has no taſte for literary amuſements, has nothing,
except his dogs and horſes, but his bumper to divert him: and the town
ſquire fits ſoaking for the ſame reaſons in a tavern. Theſe are the
common herd of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s ſwine: but nothing is more ſhocking, than
to ſee a man of ſenſe thus deſtroying his parts and conſtitution. It
not only makes a terrible innovation in his whole frame and intellects; but
alſo robs him of the ſociety of thoſe like himſelf, with whom he
ſhould aſſociate, and reduces him to the level of a ſet of wretches;
ſince all may be admitted to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſation, who are able to
toſs off a bumper.</p>
               <p>THESE conſiderations are ſufficient to convince us of the
evils which reſult from hard-drinking: but it will ſhock us ſtill more,
if we reflect how much it will influence our life and conduct. Whoever is
engaged in a profeſſion will never apply to it with ſucceſs, while he
ſticks ſo cloſe to his bottle; and the tradeſman, who endeavours to
make buſineſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure compatible, will never be able to make both
ends meet. Thus whether health, fame, or intereſt is regarded, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhould be avoided; and we may ſay with <hi>Caſſio,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Every inordinate cup is unbleſt, and the
ingredient is a Devil."</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> CANNOT but admire the ingenious device prefixed to the
advertiſements of <hi>Hazard</hi>'s Lottery-Office, in which Fortune is
repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented hovering over the heads of a number of people, and ſcattering
down all kinds of Prizes among them. What Mr. <hi>Hazard</hi> has here
delineated, every adventurer in the late Lottery had pictured to himſelf: the
ten thouſand conſtantly floated before his eyes, and each perſon had
already poſſeſſed it in imagination. But alas! all our expectations are
now at an end; the golden dream is at length vaniſhed; and thoſe, who were
kept giddy all the while that the wheel of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <pb n="560" facs="tcp:1252700302:135"/> was
turning round, have now leiſure ſoberly to reflect on their
diſappointment. How many unhappy tradeſmen muſt now trudge on foot all
their lives, who deſigned to loll in their chariots! how many poor maidens,
of good family but no fortune, muſt languiſh all their days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the
comforts of an huſband and a coach and fix! Every loſer thinks himſelf
ill uſed by Fortune: and even Mrs. <hi>Betty,</hi> the poſſeſſor of a
ſingle ſixteenth, flies to the Office, pays her penny, and receives the
tidings of her ill luck with ſurprize; goes to another Office, pays her
penny, hears the ſame diſagreeable information, and can hardly, very hardly
perſuade herſelf, that Fortune ſhould have doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſtill to waſh
the diſhes and ſcrub down the ſtairs.</p>
               <p>THUS the views of every adventurer are directed to the ſame
point, though their motives for engaging in the Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery may be different. One
man puts in, becauſe he is willing to be in Fortune's way; another, becauſe
he had good luck in the laſt; and another, becauſe he never got any thing
before. This indulges in the proſpect of making a fortune, and that buoys
himſelf up with the hopes of retrieving his deſperate circumſtances.
Every one, however, thinks himſelf as ſure of the ten thouſand, as if he
had it in his pocket; and his only concern is, how to diſpoſe of it. In
this light we may conſider every adventurer, as having been in actual
poſſeſſion of this treaſure; and out of fifty thouſand people, who
have been bleſt within this fortnight with ſuch ideal good fortune, I
ſhall ſelect the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances, which fell within my own
notice.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WILKINS of <hi>Thames Street</hi> Eſquire, Oilman and
Cheeſemonger, got the 10,000 l. He could not bear <pb n="561" facs="tcp:1252700302:136"/> the
foggy air and dingy ſituation of the City: he therefore reſolved to take an
houſe at the St. <hi>James</hi>'s end of the town, and intended to fit up a
ſnug box at <hi>Hampſtead</hi> in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> taſte, for his
retirement on Sundays. A Chariot was abſolutely neceſſary, to carry him
to and from <hi>'Change</hi> every morning: but he deſigned to have it made
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the modern faſhion, that it might occaſionally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into a Poſt-Chaiſe, to wheel him on a Saturday night to his Country-ſeat,
and back again on the Monday morning. Nothing was now wanting but a careful
plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding partner, who ſhould take upon himſelf the whole drudgery of the
ſhop; ſo that the Squire might have no farther trouble than to receive his
dividend of the profits. But while he was conſidering on whom this important
favour ſhould be conferred, his ticket was drawn—blank: and Squire
<hi>Wilkins</hi> is contented with his greaſy employment of meaſuring out
lamp-oil, and cutting out penny-worths of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Cheeſe.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES of <hi>Ludlow</hi> in the county of <hi>Salop</hi>
Eſquire, Dealer and Chapman, got the 10,000 l. This gentleman was fore-warned
of his ſucceſs by ſeveral undeniable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens. His lady had dreamt of a
<hi>particular Number</hi> four nights together; and while the bells were
ringing upon his being choſe Bailiff of the Corporation, they ſpoke in as
plain words, as ever <hi>Whittington</hi> heard, 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Mr. John Jones will get ten thouſand
pound—Mr. John Jones will get ten thouſand pound.</hi>"</q> He and his
lady therefore came up to <hi>London:</hi> and not being able to meet with the
<hi>particular Number</hi> at <hi>Hazard</hi>'s or <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s or any
other Office always remarkable for ſelling the ten thouſands, they
advertized it <pb n="562" facs="tcp:1252700302:137"/> in the papers, and got the great Prize,
for only paying a guinea more for their ticket than the market-price. As Mrs.
<hi>Jones</hi> knew a good deal of the world, (having lived for ſome years in
quality of an upper ſervant in a great houſe,) ſhe was determined that
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſhould take the opportunity, now they were in town, of
learning how to behave himſelf as he ſhould do, when he came to his
fortune. She therefore introduced him into the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in all the
houſe-keepers and ſtewards rooms in the beſt families, where ſhe was
acquainted: and as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was ſo deficient in politeneſs, as
not even to know how to make a bow in coming into a room, he had private
leſſons from Mr. <hi>Dukes,</hi> who undertakes to teach Grown Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to dance. Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> herſelf was very buſy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with
the milliner and mantua-maker about the neweſt faſhions, when the long
looked-for ten thouſand came up: and directly after the <hi>Hey-Ge-Ho</hi>
carried them down again to <hi>Salop</hi> with this only conſolation, that
their ticket was within one of the fortunate Number.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN WILDGOOSE of <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> Silk Mercer, had too
much taſte to be confined to dirty buſineſs, which he neglected for the
more agreeable perſuits of pleaſure. Having therefore met with great
loſſes in trade, he was obliged to embark the remains of his ſhattered
fortune in the Lottery, and by purchaſing a number of tickets ſecured to
himſelf the 10,000 l. He had determined to keep his ſucceſs ſecret,
bilk his creditors by becoming bankrupt, turn the whole into an annuity for his
life, and live abroad like a gentleman upon the income. But unluckily his
creditors came upon him too quickly; and before he could know that he had
<hi>not</hi> got the ten thouſand, hurried him <pb n="563" facs="tcp:1252700302:138"/> to
jail, where he now lies, lamenting that the <hi>Act of Inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency</hi> was
not poſtponed 'till after the Lottery.</p>
               <p>SIR HUMPHRY OLDCASTLE, having greatly dipt his eſtate by being
choſen into Parliament on the Tory intereſt, mortgaged all he had left, to
put himſelf in the way of the the 10,000l. for the good of his country. This
ſeaſonable recruit fixed him a ſtaunch patriot: and he declared he would
ſtand another election againſt all oppoſitions. But, however it happened,
the finiſhing of the lottery has induced him to change his ſentiments; and
Sir <hi>Humphry</hi> in lieu of the 10,000 l. has accepted a place.</p>
               <p>JEMMY LISTER, an Attorney's Clerk, was carried into the Lottery
by pure diſintereſted love. He had conceived a violent paſſion for his
maſter's daughter; but the prudent old gentleman could not be prevailed on to
give her away to an handſome young fellow without a penny. This enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him
ſo much, that he was in doubt whether he ſhould beſtow his 10,000 l. on
the young lady, or employ it more faſhionably in keeping a girl. However, his
hopes ſoon ſunk to one of the 5,000 l. prizes, which he at once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to ſettle upon her together with his perſon. But in this too he was
diſappointed, as alſo of the other inferior prizes; and having received a
poſitive refuſal from his miſtreſs, out of mere ſpite he directly
married the maid.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN MAC MULLEN, a decayed Gameſter, made a ſhift to
purchaſe the <hi>Chance</hi> of a Ticket, which came up 10,000l. He
immediately flew to <hi>Arthur</hi>'s (late <hi>White</hi>'s,) riſked it all
at Hazard, ſet the whole table, and ſtript the company of their laſt
ſhilling. After this he bought running-horſes, made matches, carried off
the beſt plates, and took in all the Knowing-Ones on the Turf. But ſo
fluctuating is the ſituation of a Gameſter, that at the end of the Lottery 
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:1252700302:139"/> he found that Fortune had left him in the lurch, without
ſo much as a groat to buy an halter.

               <p>I NEED not point out any particular inſtances among the other
ſex, with reſpect to their diſpoſal of the 10,000 l. which every lady
had ſecured by chuſing the ticket herſelf, taking particular care that
the number be an odd one. The married ladies have ſufficient calls for even
double this ſum, to ſupply them with the neceſſaries of dreſs, and to
anſwer the expences of frequenting public diverſions: and as to the
unmarried ladies, they very well know the truth of that maxim in the ballad,
that 
<q rend="inline">"in ten thouſand pounds ten thouſand charms
are center'd."</q> Some ancient maiden ladies, who could never be brought to
think of an huſband, or to give into the vanities of the world, were
reſolved to live retired upon their Prize in the country, and leave proofs of
their good diſpoſitions behind them, by ſwelling out their Wills with a
long liſt of <hi>Items</hi> to this or that charity or hoſpital.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude, I cannot but take notice of the great
generoſity of my own PUBLISHER upon getting the 10,000 l. As his ſucceſs
was owing to his laying out in the Lottery all the profits, which had already
riſen from the publication of this Paper, he had determined to circulate my
future numbers <hi>gratis</hi>; and had even deſigned to keep open houſe
for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of poor authors. Unhappily for the public, as well as my
brother-writers, Fortune has fruſtrated his diſintereſted ſcheme: Even
I myſelf am admitted to eat his mutton but once a week; and (inſtead of
giving away my papers) he has advertiſed, that the <hi>Twelves</hi> edition
of the CONNOISSEUR will be publiſhed on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 25th of this
inſtant <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> in <hi>Two Pocket Volumes, Price</hi> Six

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was going through <hi>Smithfield</hi> the other day, I
obſerved an old fellow with a wooden leg, dreſt in a ſailor's habit, who
courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly invited the paſſer-by to peep into his raree-ſhow, for the
ſmall price of an half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny. His exhibitions, I found, were very well
ſuited to the times, and quite in character for himſelf: for among other
particulars, with which he amuſed the little audience of children that
ſurrounded his box, I was mightily pleaſed to hear the following, 
<q rend="inline">"—there you ſee the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
fleet perſuing the <hi>French</hi> ſhips, which are running
away—there you ſee Major-General <hi>Johnſon</hi> beating the
<hi>French</hi> ſoldiers in <hi>America,</hi> and taking Count
<hi>Dieſkau</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner—there you ſee the <hi>Grand
Monarque,</hi> upon his <pb n="566" facs="tcp:1252700302:141"/> knees before King
<hi>George,</hi> begging his life."</q> As the thoughts of the public are now
wholly turned upon war, it is no wonder that every method is taken to inſpire
us with a love of our country, and an abhorrence of the <hi>French</hi> king:
and not only the old ſeaman with his raree-ſhow, but the public theatres
have likewiſe had a view to the ſame point. At <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> we have
already been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the <hi>Humours of the Navy</hi>; and I am
aſſured, that at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Mr. <hi>Barry</hi> will make an
entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>France</hi> in the perſon of that renowned hero
<hi>Henry the fifth.</hi> And as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are naturally fond of
bloody exhibitions on the ſtage, I am told that a new Pantomime, entitled the
<hi>Ohio,</hi> is preparing at this laſt houſe, more terrible than any of
it's <hi>Hells, Devils,</hi> and <hi>fiery Dragons;</hi> in which will be
introduced the <hi>Indian Manner of Fighting,</hi> to conclude with a
repreſentation of the Grand <hi>Scalping Dance with all its Horrors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE this warlike diſpoſition prevails in the nation, I am
under ſome apprehenſions, leſt the attention of the public ſhould be
called off from the weighty concerns of theſe papers. I already perceive,
that the common news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers are more eagerly ſnatched up in the public
coffee-houſes than my eſſays; and the <hi>Gazette</hi> is much oftener
called for than the <hi>Connoiſſeur.</hi> For theſe reaſons I find it
neceſſary to lay open my own importance before the public, to ſhew that I
myſelf am acting (as it were) in a military capacity, and that
Cenſor-General TOWN has done his country no leſs ſervice as a valiant and
ſkilful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander at home, than Major-General <hi>Johnſon</hi> in
<hi>America.</hi> Authors may very properly be ſaid to be engaged in a
ſtate of literary warfare; many of whom are taken into <pb n="567" facs="tcp:1252700302:142"/>
pay by thoſe great and mighty potentates the bookſellers: and it will be
allowed, that they undergo no leſs hardſhips in the ſervice, than the
common ſoldiers who are contented to be ſhot at for a groat a day.</p>
               <p>IT has been my province to repell the daily inroads and
encroachments made by vice and folly, and to guard the nation from an
invaſion of foreign fopperies and <hi>French</hi> faſhions. The town has
been principally the ſcene of action; where I have found enemies to encounter
with, no leſs formidable than the <hi>Tquattotquaws</hi> or the
<hi>Chickchimuckchis</hi> of <hi>North-America.</hi> But as the curioſity of
the public is ſo much engaged in attending to the enterprizes of Old
<hi>Hendrick</hi> the <hi>Sachem,</hi> and the incurſions of <hi>Indians</hi>
who have taken up the hatchet againſt our Colonies, I am afraid that my
exploits againſt the Savages, which infeſt this metropolis, will be wholly
over-looked. I have therefore reſolved to give my readers freſh advices
from time to time of what paſſes here, drawn up in the ſame warlike
ſtile and manner as thoſe very alarming articles of news, which are
commonly to be met with in our public papers.</p>
               <p>WE hear from <hi>White</hi>'s, that the forces under Major
General <hi>Hoyle,</hi> which uſed to encamp at that place, are removed from
thence, and have fixed their winter quarters at <hi>Arthur</hi>'s. The ſame
letters ſay, that an obſtinate engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was fought there a few nights
ago, in which one party gained a great booty, and the other ſuffered a
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſs. We are alſo informed, that an epidemical diſtemper
rages among them, and that ſeveral of the chiefs have been carried off by a
ſudden death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:1252700302:143"/>THEY write from <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
that laſt week a Body of <hi>Irregulars</hi> ſallied out at midnight,
ſtormed ſeveral forts in that neighbourhood, and committed great outrages;
but being attacked by a detachment from the allied army of watchmen,
conſtables, and juſtices, they were put to flight, and ſeveral of them
taken priſoners. The plague ſtill rages there with great violence, as well
as in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring territories of <hi>Drury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE hear from the ſame place, that the <hi>Company</hi>
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Brigadier <hi>Rich</hi> has been reinforced with ſeveral
new-raiſed recruits to ſupply the place of ſome deſerters, who had gone
over to the enemy: but his chief dependance is on the light-armed troops, which
are very active, and are diſtinguiſhed, like the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> by
their party-coloured dreſs. The enemy, on the other hand, have taken
ſeveral <hi>Swiſs</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> into pay; though they were at
firſt under terrible apprehenſions of their being ſet upon by the
<hi>Critics.</hi> Theſe are a rude, ignorant, ſavage people, who are always
at war with the nation of <hi>Authors.</hi> Their conſtant manner of fighting
is to begin the onſet with ſtrange hiſſings and noiſes, accompanied
with an horrid inſtrument, named the <hi>Cat-call</hi>; which, like the
<hi>War-hoop</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> has ſtruck a panic into the hearts
of the ſtouteſt heroes.</p>
               <p>WE have advice from the <hi>Butcher Row,</hi> that on monday
night laſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> held a grand Council of war at their head
quarters in the <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> at which their good friend and ally, the
<hi>Mufti</hi> of <hi>Clare-market,</hi> aſſiſted in perſon. After many
debates, they reſolved to declare war againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
and never to make peace, till they had pulled <pb n="569" facs="tcp:1252700302:144"/> down all
the Churches in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the
<hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> in lieu of the Bible.</p>
               <p>ALL our advices from the City of <hi>London</hi> agree in their
accounts of the great havock and ſlaughter made there on the Feſtival,
commonly called <hi>My Lord Mayor's Day.</hi> All the <hi>Companies</hi> in
their black uniform, and the trained bands in their regimentals, made a general
forage. They carried off vaſt quantities of chickens, geeſe, ducks, and all
kinds of proviſions. Major <hi>Guzzledown</hi> of <hi>Baſſiſhaw</hi>
diſtinguiſhed himſelf greatly, having with ſword in hand gallantly
attacked the out-works, ſcaled the walls, mounted the ramparts, and forced
through the covert-way of a large fortified Cuſtard, which ſeemed
impregnable.</p>
               <p>THE Inhabitants of <hi>Suſſex</hi> have lately been alarmed
with the apprehenſions of an Invaſion; as the <hi>French</hi> have been
very buſy in fitting out ſeveral ſmall veſſels laden with ſtores of
wine and brandy, with which it is thought they will attempt to make a deſcent
ſomewhere on our coaſts. The Independant Companies of <hi>Smugglers</hi> in
the ſervice of <hi>France</hi> are to be ſent on this expedition: but if
the fleet of Cuſtom-houſe ſmacks, &amp;c. do not intercept them at ſea,
we are preparing to receive them as ſoon as they are landed.</p>
               <p>FROM divers parts of the country we have advice, that the roads
are every where crowded with Ladies, who (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſeverity of
the weather) are hurrying up to <hi>London,</hi> to be preſent at the meeting
of the <hi>Female Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</hi> At this critical juncture the fate of the
nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely on the deliberations of this wiſe and auguſt
Aſſembly: and as there are known to be many diſintereſted 
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:1252700302:145"/> patriots in the Houſe, it is not to be doubted but
that proper meaſures will be perſued for the good of their country. Many
ſalutary laws are already talked of, which we could wiſh to ſee put in
execution; ſuch as—A Bill for prohibiting the importation of
<hi>French</hi> Milliners, Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutters, and Mantua-makers.—A Bill for
the exportation of <hi>French</hi> Cooks and <hi>French</hi> Valets de
Chambres.—A Bill to reſtrain Ladies from wearing <hi>French
Dreſſes.</hi>—And laſtly, a Bill to reſtrain them from wearing
<hi>French Faces.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S every marriage is a kind of family feſtival, the
wedding-day is honoured with various celebrities, and diſtinguiſhed like
the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> the birth-days of the Royal Family, or any
other public day, with many demonſtrations of joy: The happy couple are
dreſt in their richeſt ſuits, the bells ring all day, and the evening is
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the merry ceremony of throwing the Stocking. But theſe
feſtivities are not always ſo religiouſly obſerved in Town, where many
a pair of quality are tacked together with the utmoſt privacy, and
immediately after ſneak out of town, as if they were aſhamed to ſhew
their faces after what they had done. In the Country, when the ſquire, or 
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:1252700302:147"/> any other perſon of diſtinction is married, the
Honey-Moon is almoſt a continued Carnival: and every marriage is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
more or leſs likely to be proſperous, in proportion to the number of deer,
oxen, and ſheep, that are killed on the occaſion, and the hogſheads of
wine and tuns of ale, with which they are waſhed down. By the laſt poſt I
received an account from my Couſin VILLAGE, of the wedding of a near
relation, with a particular detail of the magnificence of the entertainment,
the ſplendor of the ball, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal joy of the whole manour. At
the ſame time I received compliments from the new-married couple, with a
large ſlice of the BRIDE-CAKE; the virtues of which are well known to every
girl of thirteen. I was never in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this nuptial charm
before: but I was ſo much delighted with this matrimonial token, and it
excited in my mind ſo many reflections on conjugal happineſs, that (though
I did not lay it under my pillow,) it gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the following
Dream.</p>
               <p>I FOUND myſelf in the middle of a ſpacious building, which
was crouded with a variety of perſons of both ſexes; and upon enquiry was
told, that it was the Temple of the God of Marriage; and that every one who had
an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſacrifice to that Deity, was invited to approach a large
altar which was covered with a great number of CAKES of different ſhapes and
appearance. Some of theſe were moulded into the form of hearts; and others
were woven into true-lovers-knots: ſome were ſtrewed with ſugar, and
ſtuck about with ſweet-meats; ſome were covered with gold; ſome were
ſtamped with coronets; and others had their tops embelliſhed with
glittering toys, that repreſented a fine houſe, a ſet of jewels, a coach
and <pb n="573" facs="tcp:1252700302:148"/> ſix or the like. <hi>Plutus</hi> and
<hi>Cupid</hi> were buſily employed in diſtributing theſe Cakes (which
were all of them marked with the word MATRIMONY, and called BRIDE-CAKES) to
different perſons, who were allowed to chuſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, according
to their different views and inclinations.</p>
               <p>I OBSERVED ſeveral haſten to the altar, who all appeared to
be differently affected by their choice. To ſome the Cakes ſeemed of ſo
delicious a flavour, that they imagined they ſhould never be ſurfeited;
while others who found the taſte very agreeable at firſt, in a ſhort time
declared it to be flat and inſipid: However, I could not help remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that many more (particularly among the quality) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves to
<hi>Plutus,</hi> than to <hi>Cupid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEING deſirous to take a nearer view of the company, I
puſhed through the croud, and placed myſelf cloſe by the altar. A young
couple now advanced, and applying to <hi>Cupid,</hi> deſired him to reach
them one of the Cakes, in the ſhape of a double heart pearced through with
darts; but juſt as they were going to ſhare it betwixt them, a crabbed old
fellow, whom I found to be the girl's father, ſtepped up, broke the cake in
two, and obliged the young lady to fix upon another which <hi>Plutus</hi>
picked out for her, and which repreſented the figure of a fine gentleman in
gilt ginger-bread.</p>
               <p>AN old fellow of ſixty-two, who had ſtolen one day from the
buſineſs of the <hi>'Change</hi> and the <hi>Alley,</hi> next came towards
the altar, and ſeemed to expreſs a ſtrong deſire for a Cake.
<hi>Plutus,</hi> who recollected him at firſt ſight, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately offered
him one, which, though very mouldy and <pb n="574" facs="tcp:1252700302:149"/> coarſe, was
gilt all over; but he was aſtoniſhed at the old gentleman's refuſing it,
and petitioning <hi>Cupid</hi> for a Cake of the moſt elegant form and
ſweeteſt ingredients of any on the altar. The little God at firſt
repulſed him with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but afterwards <hi>ſold</hi> it to him for
a large ſum of money; a circumſtance which amazed me beyond
expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but which I ſoon found was very commonly practiſed in this
Temple. The old fellow retired with his purchaſed prize: and though I
imagined he might ſtill have a colt's tooth remaining, after having for
ſome time mumbled it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his old gums in vain, it lay by him untouched
and unenjoyed.</p>
               <p>I WAS afterwards very much diſguſted with the many
inſtances that occurred, of theſe delicate morſels being ſet up to
ſale: and I found, that their price roſe and fell, like that of beef or
mutton, according to the glut or ſcarcity of the market. I was particularly
affected with the diſpoſal of the two following. A young gentleman and lady
were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the altar, and had agreed to take between them a Cake of a
plain form but delicious flavour, marked <hi>Love and Competence</hi>; but a
perſon of quality ſtepping forward perſuaded the falſe female to join
with him, and receive from <hi>Plutus</hi> a glittering dainty, marked
<hi>Indifference and a large Settlement.</hi> Another lady was coming up with a
Knight of the Bath, being tempted by a Cake with a red ribbon ſtreaming from
it, like the flags on a Twelfth-Cake; but was prevailed on by a perſon of
greater rank and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction to accept a more ſhowy Cake, adorned with a
blue ribbon and a coronet.</p>
               <p>A BUXOM dame of an amourous complexion came next, and begged
very hard for a Cake. She had before received <pb n="575" facs="tcp:1252700302:150"/> ſeveral
which ſuited her tooth, and pleaſed her palate ſo exceſſively, that
as ſoon as ſhe had diſpatched one, ſhe conſtantly came to
<hi>Cupid</hi> for another. She now ſeized her Cake with great tranſport,
and retiring to a corner with it, I could diſcern her greedily mumbling the
delicious morſel, though ſhe had fairly worn out ſix and twenty of her
teeth in the ſervice. After this an ancient lady came tottering up to the
altar, ſupported by a young fellow in a red coat with a ſhoulder-knot.
<hi>Plutus</hi> gave him a ſtale Cake marked with the word JOINTURE in large
golden capitals, which he received with ſome reluctance, while the old lady
eagerly ſnatched another from <hi>Cupid,</hi> (who turned his head aſide
from her,) on which I could plainly diſcover the word DOTAGE.</p>
               <p>A RICH ruſty batchelor of the laſt century then came
buſtling through the croud. He brought with him a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeked country girl of
nineteen. As he approached the altar, he met ſeveral coming from it with
Cakes, which he had refuſed: ſome of which were marked <hi>Riches,</hi>
ſome <hi>Family,</hi> ſome <hi>Beauty,</hi> and one or two
<hi>Affection.</hi> The girl he brought with him proved to be his dairy-maid,
whom he had for ſome time paſt been in vain attempting to bring over to his
wiſhes; but at laſt finding his deſign impracticable, he came with her to
the altar. He ſeemed, indeed, a little aſhamed of his undertaking, and
betrayed a good deal of aukwardneſs in his manner and deportment. However, as
ſoon as he had taken his Cake, he retired; and determined to ſpend the
reſt of his days with his milch-cow in the country.</p>
               <p>TO ſatisfy a modeſt longing, there now advanced a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
lady in the bloom of threeſcore. She had, it ſeems, heretofore refuſed
ſeveral offers from <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Plutus</hi>; but 
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:1252700302:151"/> being enraged to find, that they had now given over all
thoughts of her, ſhe ſeized by the hand a young Enſign of the Guards, and
carried him to the altar, whence ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſnatched up a Cake, and
divided it with her gallant. She was highly delighted with the taſte of it at
firſt, but her partner being very ſoon cloyed, ſhe too late diſcovered
that the half which ſhe held in her hand was ſigned <hi>Folly,</hi> and
that which ſhe had forced upon her paramour was marked
<hi>Averſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A LITTLE, pert, forward Miſs in a frock and hanging ſleeves
briſkly ran up to <hi>Cupid,</hi> and begged for a Cake: what it was ſhe
did not care; but a Cake ſhe muſt and would have, of one kind or another.
She had juſt ſtretched out her hand to receive one from <hi>Cupid,</hi>
when her mamma interpoſed, ſent the child back again blubbering to the
boarding-ſchool, and carried off the Cake herſelf.</p>
               <p>AN old woman, fantaſtically dreſt, then burſt into the
Temple, and run raving up to the altar, crying out that her name was MARY
SINGLETON, and ſhe would have an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. But the poor lady ſeemed
likely to be diſappointed; for as ſhe could prevail on no one to join hands
with her, both <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Plutus</hi> refuſed to favour her with
a Cake. Furious with rage and deſpair, ſhe ſnatched one off the altar;
and ſeizing on the firſt man that came in her way, (which unfortunately
happened to be myſelf,) ſhe would have crammed it forcibly down my throat.
As the leaſt crumb of it was as diſagreeable as a drench to an horſe, I
began to ſpawl and ſputter and keck; and though the flurry of ſpirits,
which it occaſioned, awaked me, I thought I had the nauſeous taſte of it
ſtill in my mouth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG the many <hi>Regiſter Offices</hi> erected within
theſe few years paſt, I am ſurprized that no ſcheme of the like nature
has been thought of for the ſervice of literature; and that no place has been
ſet apart, where Literary Commodities of every ſort might be diſpoſed
of; where men of learning might meet with employment, and where others, who
want their aſſiſtance, might be ſure to <pb n="578" facs="tcp:1252700302:153"/> meet
with men of learning. There is nothing of this kind in being at preſent,
except among the bookſellers; who have made a monopoly of the trade, and
engroſſed the whole market to themſelves. To remedy this inconvenience,
my deſign is to ſet up a LITERARY REGISTER OFFICE: for which purpoſe I
intend to hire the now uſeleſs theatre in <hi>Lincolns Inn Fields,</hi> and
convert it into a mart for the ſtaple commodities of the literary
commonwealth. I ſhall here fit up apartments for the reception of my authors,
who will be employed from time to time in ſupplying the public with the
requiſite manufactures. This ſcheme, will, I doubt not, meet with great
encouragement, as it is of general utility: and I do not remember any deſign
of the ſame nature, except at a barber's on the other ſide the water, who
has hung out a board over his ſhop with the following
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription—<hi>Letters read and written for Servants and
others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I SHALL always have a freſh aſſortment of goods in the
beſt taſte and neweſt faſhion: as of Novels for example, while the
humour of reading them is prevalent among all ranks of people. For this branch
I ſhall retain a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent maſter-novelliſt, to cut out adventures
and intrigues; and ſhall employ a proper number of hands to finiſh the work
with all poſſible care and expedition: and if any ladies of quality, or
others, chuſe to furniſh their own materials for Memoirs and Apologies,
they may have them done up, and be fitted exactly, at my Office. Beſides
ſeveral others, which my men ſhall get up with the greateſt diſpatch, I
can aſſure you I have myſelf worked night and day, and have already
finiſhed ſix and thirty ſheets of the Hiſtory of Miſs <hi>Sukey
Sapling,</hi> Written by Herſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="579" facs="tcp:1252700302:154"/>PAMPHLETS of all ſorts ſhall be
compoſed, whenever any popular ſubject ſtarts up, that is likely to
engage the attention of the public. Every new play ſhall be followed by an
<hi>Examen</hi> or <hi>Remarks:</hi> all riots at either play-houſe will
afford ſcope for <hi>Letters to the Managers</hi>; and every new actor or
actreſs produce theatrical criticiſms. Poetry, you know, Mr. TOWN, is a
mere drug; but I ſhall always have a number of ready-made Odes by me, which
may be ſuited to any Great Man, dead or alive, in place or out of place. I
ſhall alſo have a large bundle of <hi>Poems on ſeveral Occaſions,</hi>
very proper for any gentleman or lady, who chuſes to publiſh by
ſubſcription; beſides a more ordinary ſort of Hymns to the Morning,
Verſes on the Death of —, Odes to Miſs <hi>A. B. C.</hi> Acroſtics
and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, for the uſe of the Magazines: to be ſold a penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
with allowance to thoſe who take a great quantity.</p>
                     <p>WITH regard to Law matters, as they have no ſort of
connexion with wit or learning, I ſhall not concern myſelf with their
unintelligible jargon; nor preſume to interfere with thoſe authors in
parchment, who meaſure their words by the foot-rule, and ſell their
writings at ſo much <hi>per</hi> line. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall furniſh young
Students of the ſeveral Inns of Court with complete Canons of Criticiſm,
and Opinions on any new theatrical Caſes; on which they may argue very
learnedly at a tavern, or plead at the bar of a coffee-houſe. For Medical
ſubjects, I ſhall procure a learned Graduate by <hi>Diploma</hi> from
abroad, whoſe practice will not ſo much take up his time as to prevent his
being at leiſure to write oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional treatiſes, ſetting forth the
virtues of any newly-invented Powder, or newly-diſcovered Water. He ſhall
alſo draw up the advertiſements for medicines, that remove 
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:1252700302:155"/> all diſeaſes, and are never known to fail; he
ſhall compile the wonderful accounts of their ſurpriſing cures; and
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh caſes that never happened, and affidavits that were never made.
With reſpect to Divinity, as I have reaſon to believe that controverſial
writings will be often called for, I intend to bargain with the <hi>Robin
Hood</hi> Society to undertake in the lump to furniſh my Office with Defences
of Lord <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke,</hi> &amp;c. and till I can procure ſome poor
curate out of the country, or ſervitor from the univerſity, to write the
<hi>Manuſcript Sermons of eminent Divines lately deceaſed, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
originals,</hi> I muſt make ſhift with the <hi>Fleet Parſons</hi> now out
of buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH I ſhall not keep any dramatic works ready made by me,
(as theſe commodities are apt to grow ſtale and out of faſhion,) yet
either of the theatres may be ſerved with tragedy, comedy, farce, or the
like, by beſpeaking them, and giving but three days notice. For the comic
pieces I ſhall employ a poet, who has long worked for the drolls at
<hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> and <hi>Southwark</hi> fairs, and has printed a comedy as
it was <hi>half</hi> acted at <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi> My tragedies will be
furniſhed by a <hi>North Briton,</hi> who walked up to <hi>London</hi> from
his native country laſt winter with a moſt ſublime tragedy in his
coat-pocket, and which is now to be diſpoſed of to the beſt bidder. Any
old play of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> or <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> ſhall be pieced
with modern ones according to the preſent taſte, or cut out in airs and
recitative for an <hi>Engliſh Opera.</hi> Rhymes for Pantomimes may be had,
to be ſet to the clack of a mill, the tinkling of a tin caſcade, or the
ſlaps of <hi>Harlequin</hi>'s wooden ſword. The proprietors of our public
Gardens, during the ſummer ſeaſon, may be alſo <pb n="581" facs="tcp:1252700302:156"/>
ſupplied from my Office with Love-Songs to a new burthen, or comic Dialogues
in <hi>Crambo</hi>; and words ſhall, at any time be fitted to the muſic,
after the tunes are compoſed.</p>
                     <p>AS I propoſe to make my Office of general utility, every
thing that bears the leaſt affinity to literature will be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
comprehended in my Scheme. Members of Parliament may be ſupplied with
Speeches on any political ſubject; and Country Juſtices may, on directing a
letter to the Office poſt paid, have Charges to the Jury at the Quarter
Seſſions ſent down to them by the firſt coach or waggon. Addreſſes
on particular occaſions ſhall be drawn up for the worſhipful mayor and
aldermen of any city or corporation: Laws, Rules, Regulations, or Orders,
ſhall be formed for the <hi>Anti-Gallicans, Ubiquarians, Gregorians,</hi> or
any private clubs and ſocieties. <hi>N. B.</hi> The <hi>Free Maſons</hi>
may depend upon ſecreſy.</p>
                     <p>MANY advantages may likewiſe accrue to the polite world from
the eſtabliſhment of my Office. Gentlemen and ladies may have
<hi>Billet-doaux</hi> written for them with the moſt ſoft and languiſhing
expreſſions: Meſſage Cards, and Invitations to Routs, ſhall be filled
up and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated at ſo much <hi>per</hi> hundred, or undertaken in the
groſs at a fixed price all the year round. Beaux may be accommodated with
letters of gallantry to ſend to their laundreſſes, or have them copied
out in a faſhionable female ſcrawl, and directed to themſelves; which
they may ſhew about as coming from ladies of quality in love with them.
Gentlemen who love fighting, but cannot write, may have challenges pen'd for
them in the true ſtile and ſpirit of a modern Blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="582" facs="tcp:1252700302:157"/>THERE are many other conveniencies
ariſing from ſuch an Office, which it would be too tedious to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
and it will be found to be no leſs beneficial to you authors, Mr. TOWN, than
thoſe other <hi>Regiſter Offices</hi> are to men and maid-ſervants. If an
author (for example) wants employment, or is out of place, he has nothing to do
but to enter his name with me, and I ſhall preſently get him work: or if a
bookſeller wants an hand for any particular job, (as a
tranſlation-ſpinner, a novel-weaver, a play-wright, a verſe-turner, or
the like) upon ſearching my books he will be ſure to meet with a man fit
for the buſineſs. In ſhort, any compoſition, in proſe or rhyme, and
on any ſubject, may be procured at a minute's warning, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to my
Office: and I dare ſay, you yourſelf, Mr. TOWN, will be very glad now and
then to purchaſe a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur</hi> of me, whenever the idle fit
ſeizes you. If that ſhould happen to come upon you this week, and you have
nothing better, you will oblige me by laying the ſcheme here ſent before
your readers; and in return, you ſhall have the credit of publiſhing your
papers at my Office, as ſoon as it is opened, and welcome.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> REMEMBER to have heard a couſin of mine, who was formerly
at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a ſect of Philoſophers
diſtinguiſhed by the reſt of the collegians by the appellation of
<hi>Tuft-Hunters.</hi> Theſe were not the diſciples of the <hi>Stoics</hi>
or <hi>Epicureans,</hi> or the advocates for the old or new philoſophy, but
the followers, literally ſpeaking, of the fellow-commoners, noblemen, and
other rich ſtudents, whom, it ſeems, the courteſy of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
has honoured with a cap adorned with a gold toſſel. Theſe few gold
threads have almoſt as much influence in the Univerſity as a red or blue
ribband at court, and always draw after the wearer a train of humble
companions, who <pb n="584" facs="tcp:1252700302:159"/> will be at his call to breakfaſt,
dine, or ſup with him whenever he pleaſes, will go with him any where,
drink with him, wench with him, borrow his money, or let him pay their
reckoning. They are, I am told, a ſort of diſeaſe of the place, which a
man of fortune is ſure to catch as ſoon as he arrives there: and theſe
faſt friends ſtick ſo cloſe to him, that he can never ſhake them off,
while he keeps his gown on his back.</p>
               <p>THE Univerſity of <hi>London</hi> is not without its
<hi>Tuft-Hunters,</hi> who faſten, like leeches, on a young man of fortune at
his firſt coming to town. They beſet him as ſoon as he arrives, and when
they have once ſurrounded him, ſeldom fail of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing him to
themſelves; for no perſons of character care to have any connections with
him, when he has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen in ſuch bad company. It is a great
misfortune for any young gentleman to fall into their hands: though indeed, as
a fool is the natural prey of knaves, the wealthy maintainers of this
fraternity are generally none of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt: And as at the Univerſity, 
<q rend="inline">"where the learned pate ducks to the golden
fool,"</q> the gentleman-ſtudent is diſtinguiſhed by a cap with a gold
tuft, I always conſider theſe ſons of folly in town as adorned with a
ſhowy cap hung with bells, which ſerve at once to denote the depth of their
parts, and to call their train about them.</p>
               <p>THE dialect of the town has very expreſſively
charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſed theſe humble dependants on men of fortune by the name of
<hi>Hangers-on.</hi> They will, indeed, take ſuch ſure hold, and hang on a
man ſo conſtantly, that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to drop them.
Whenever the gentleman appears, the <hi>Hanger-on</hi> is ſure to be at his
elbow. They will ſqueeze <pb n="585" facs="tcp:1252700302:160"/> themſelves into every party
that is formed; and I have known inſtances of their thruſting themſelves
into ſtrange families, by ſticking to their patron's ſkirts, and
impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently introducing themſelves where he has been invited to dinner:
which, indeed, I think would not be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper cuſtom, provided they would
ſubmit to ſtand behind his chair. They will ſtick ſo cloſely, that
all the adheſive quality of burs, pitch, &amp;c. ſeem to be collected in
them; and the line in <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> ſo often
ridiculed, may rather be conſidered as emphaſis than tautology in
ſpeaking of Them. The <hi>Hanger-on</hi> clings to his fool, as
<hi>Ulyſſes</hi> did to the rock, and in <hi>Pope</hi>'s words, 
<q> 
                     <l>They STICK ADHERENT, and SUSPENDED HANG.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE tenaciouſneſs of a <hi>Hanger-on</hi> is ſo very
ſtrong, that whoever is drawn into their ſnares, is ſo firmly limed he
can hardly ever looſe himſelf from them. For as nothing but the loweſt
meanneſs of ſpirit could ever prevail on a man to ſubmit to ſuch
dependance on another, it is in vain to think of getting rid of ſuch abject
wretches by treating them with contempt. They will take as much beating,
provided you will allow them an equal degree of familiarity, as a ſpaniel.
They will alſo ſubmit to do any little offices, and are glad to make
themſelves uſeful, whenever they have an opportunity. They will go among
the brokers to borrow money for you, pimp for you, or ſubmit to any other
ſuch gentleman-like employment to ſerve their friend.</p>
               <p>IT muſt here be noted, that every <hi>Hanger-on</hi> is a
perſon of ſtrict honour and a gentleman; for though his fortune is (to be
ſure) ſomewhat inferior to yours, and he ſubmits to <pb n="586" facs="tcp:1252700302:161"/> make himſelf convenient on ſeveral occaſions, yet on that
account you are indebted to his infinite good-nature; and all his endeavours to
ſerve you proceed from his great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and regard for you. I remember
one of theſe friendly gentlemen, who carried his eſteem ſo far, that in a
quarrel with his rich companion, in which he was favoured with ſeveral tweaks
by the noſe and kicks on the breech, he received all theſe injuries with
patience, and only ſaid with tears in his eyes, 
<q rend="inline">"Dear <hi>Jack,</hi> I never expected this
uſage from you. You know I don't mind fighting; but I ſhould never have a
moment's peace, if I was to do you the leaſt injury. Come, <hi>Jack,</hi> let
us buſs and be friends."</q> Their gentility is unqueſtionable, for they
are ſeldom of any trade, though they are ſometimes (being younger-brothers
perhaps) of a profeſſion. I know one, who is a nominal lawyer; but though
his friend has often fee'd him, our Counſellor could never with any propriety
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as a client; and I know another, who (like <hi>Gibbet</hi> in
the play) is called Captain, whoſe elegant manner of living muſt be
ſupported by his being on full pay with his patron, ſince he does not
receive even the common ſoldier's groat a day from his commiſſion.
However, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering at one view the gentility of their profeſſion, and
the ſhortneſs of their finances, I often look on them as a band of decayed
gentlemen, the honourable penſioners of thoſe they follow. The great men
among the <hi>Romans</hi> had a number of theſe <hi>Hangers-on,</hi> which
attended them where-ever they went, and were emphatically called
<hi>Umbrae,</hi> or <hi>Shadows</hi>; and, indeed, this appellation conveys a
very full idea of the nature of theſe humble retainers to the wealthy,
ſince they not only follow them like their ſhadows, but 
<q rend="inline">"like a ſhadow prove the ſubſtance
true:"</q> for whenever <pb n="587" facs="tcp:1252700302:162"/> you obſerve one or more of
theſe <hi>Umbrae</hi> perpetually at the heels of any gentleman, you may
fairly conclude him to be a man of fortune.</p>
               <p>THESE faithful friends are ſo careful of every thing that
concerns you, that they always enquire with the greateſt exactneſs into
your affairs, and know almoſt as well as your ſteward the income of your
eſtate. They are alſo ſo fond of your company, and ſo deſirous of
preſerving your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a <hi>Hanger-on</hi> will take as much
pains to keep you entirely to himſelf, and to prevent a rival in your
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as a miſtreſs: and as a convenient female is a very
neceſſary part of the equipage of a perſon of faſhion, theſe male
companions muſt be a very agreeable part of the retinue of thoſe
high-ſpirited young gentlemen, who are fond of being the head of their
company. It is only a more refined taſte in expence to pay a man for laughing
at your wit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging your humour: and who will either drink his bottle
with you at the tavern, or run to the end of the town for you on an errand.</p>
               <p>I MIGHT alſo take notice of an humbler ſort of
<hi>Hangers-on,</hi> who fix themſelves to no one particular, but faſten
upon all their friends in their turns. Their views, indeed, are ſeldom
extended beyond a preſent ſubſiſtence, and their utmoſt aim perhaps
is to get a dinner. For this purpoſe they keep a regiſter of the hours of
dining of all their acquaintance; and though they contrive to call in upon you
juſt as you are ſitting down to table, they are always with much difficulty
prevailed upon to take a chair. If you dine abroad, or are gone into the
country, they will eat with your family to prevent their being melancholy on
account <pb n="588" facs="tcp:1252700302:163"/> of your abſence; or if your family is out,
they will break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, dine, and ſup with you out of charity, becauſe you
ſhould not be alone. Every houſe is haunted with theſe diſturbers of
our meals: and perhaps the beſt way to get rid of them, would be to put them,
with the reſt of your ſervants, upon board-wages.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides theſe danglers after men of fortune, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders on your table in town, the country breeds a race of lowly retainers,
which may properly be ranked among the ſame ſpecies. Almoſt every family
ſupports a poor kinſman, who happening to be no way related to the
eſtate, was too proud of his blood to apply himſelf in his youth to any
profeſſion, and rather choſe to be ſupported in lazineſs at the
family-ſeat. They are, indeed, known perhaps to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins to the
ſquire, but do not appear in a more creditable light than his ſervants out
of livery; and ſometimes actually ſubmit to as mean offices of drudgery as
the groom or whipper-in. The whole fraternity of <hi>Hangers-on,</hi> whether
in town or country, or under whatever denomination, are the ſons of
idleneſs: for it will be found upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whenever a man,
whoſe bread depends on his induſtry, gives himſelf up to indolence, he
becomes capable of any meanneſs whatever: and if <hi>they cannot dig,</hi>
yet like our <hi>Hangers-on, to beg they are not aſhamed.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE been ſome years married to one of the beſt women
in the world. She poſſeſſes all the virtues that can be named: but
alas! ſhe poſſeſſes ſome of them to exceſs. Thoſe which I
wiſh to particularize, and which are infinitely pernicious to me, and my
fortunes, are her ſuperabundant Good-nature, and her boundleſs
Generoſity.</p>
                     <p>IT is a little difficult perhaps to aſcertain what are, or
ought to be, the exact bounds of Good-nature; which, of all virtues, ſeems to
me moſt neceſſary to be confined, or at leaſt mitigated in ſuch a
manner, as to hinder it from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying <pb n="590" facs="tcp:1252700302:165"/> its own
excellence and utility. On the one hand, if it is reſtrained too cloſe, the
world will ſay, that it muſt entirely loſe its eſſence: But fatal
experience has convinced me, that if it is permitted to enjoy a full unlimited
ſway, this amiable virtue becomes a ridiculous vice; and brings with it, as
in my wife's caſe, fruitleſs expences, ill-judged conceſſions, and a
kind of blind folly, that is always liable to contempt.</p>
                     <p>GENEROSITY is the daughter of Good-nature. She is very fair
and lovely when under the tuition of Judgment and Reaſon; but when ſhe
eſcapes from her tutors, and acts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately, according as her fancy
allures her, ſhe ſubjects herſelf, like her mother, to the blaſts of
ſneer, ridicule, and diſdain.</p>
                     <p>TO illuſtrate theſe aſſertions by ſome examples,
from among the many miſhaps, loſſes, and embaraſſments, which have
accrued to us in the courſe of our domeſtic affairs, give me leave to tell
you, that ſome years ago, we had a footboy who acted as butler, and had the
cuſtody of all the little plate which our ſmall fortune could afford us.
The fellow was aukward, and unfit for the ſtation; but my wife very
good-naturedly was determined to keep him in our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, becauſe he
intended to marry the nurſery-maid, and would undoubtedly make an excellent
huſband. The raſcal was a thief; but as it is ill-natured to ſuſpect
people, before we have full proof of their knavery, ſeveral of his tricks,
and petty larcenies, were attributed to the itinerant Jews and higlers (we then
living at <hi>Newington)</hi> who frequently called at our door. Fluſhed with
ſucceſs, and relying on my wife's credulity and Good-nature, he began to
form deeper deſigns; and (as he lay in the kitchen) pretended to have ſeen
a man breaking in at the window, and to have hid himſelf with a chopping
knife in his hand, ſo as to have felled the villain to the ground as ſoon
as he had put his body through the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <pb n="591" facs="tcp:1252700302:166"/> A
noiſe from without was ſaid to have given an alarm to the houſebreaker,
and to have interrupted him in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but ſome whole panes of glaſs
being diſlocated from their lead, and ſome hacks and ſcratches of a
chiſel (marks all made by our own ſervant) being viſible next morning, my
wife very generouſly <hi>rewarded</hi> her <hi>Jemmy,</hi> whom ſhe
jocularly called <hi>Scrub,</hi> for his diligence and courage in defending us
from having our throats cut. This terrible tale was doubtleſs formed in order
to remove all ſuſpicions, when he ſhould pillage the houſe himſelf;
but precautions being taken by us, in conſequence of this alarm, to fortify
our bed-chamber, where he knew our current treaſure was repoſited,
<hi>Jemmy</hi> thought it time to decamp; ſo that in about a week after he
had received the reward, I hinted at, of a crown piece from his lady, he
ſtole her gold repeating watch, and a pair of our beſt ſilver
candleſticks, with which he voluntarily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported himſelf, as we have
been ſince told, to the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> leaving his miſtreſs the
nurſery-maid, big with child, and thereby giving great licence to the
neighbourhood to animadvert upon my wife's amazing preſcience in foreſeeing
his excellencies as an huſband.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt further be told, Sir, that my dear conſort, in
the full glow of her goodneſs, is never contented unleſs her ſervants
marry each other. All I can urge againſt ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic a cuſtom has been
to no purpoſe: Marriage (ſhe ſays) prevents vice, and ſaves ſouls
from deſtruction. Perhaps it may; but are no unmarried ſervants to be found
in Mr. <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Regiſter Office, or elſewhere, but what are
vicious? At leaſt I am ſure, that this piece of ſanctity is very
expenſive in its effects, and is attended with many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. One of
her maids about two years ago was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be very intimate with my
footman; my wife, to prevent ill conſequences, haſtened to have them
married, and was preſent herſelf at the ceremony. She admired the
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the woman and the decent gravity of the man during 
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:1252700302:167"/> the holy rites, and ſhe was entirely convinced that no
harm could have happened from ſo decent a couple. In little more than three
months after the marriage, <hi>Patty</hi> brought forth a ſwinging girl; but
as it was born almoſt ſix months before its time, my wife adviſed them to
keep it the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half year in cotton. She did this purely from a motive
of good-nature, to try to ſhield the new married woman's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; but
finding our neighbours fleer at the incident, and ſmile contemptuouſly at
the preſcription of cotton, ſhe contented herſelf in believing
<hi>Patty</hi>'s own account, that 
<q rend="inline">"in truth ſhe had been married eight months
before by a <hi>Fleet-parſon,</hi> but was afraid to own it."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT if my wife's indulging her domeſtics in matrimony was
productive of no other ill conſequence than merely their being married, it
might indeed ſometimes rather prove a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit than a detriment: but the
chaſter and more ſober they have been before marriage, the greater number
of children are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in matrimony; and my wife looks upon herſelf as in
duty obliged to take care of the poor helpleſs offspring, that have been
begotten under her own roof; ſo that I aſſure you, Sir, my houſe is
ſo well filled with children, that it would put you immediately in mind of
the <hi>Foundling Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital</hi>; with this difference however, that in
<hi>my Hoſpital</hi> not only the children are provided for, whether
baſtards or legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, but alſo the fathers and mothers.</p>
                     <p>YOUR high office, Mr. CENSOR, requires and leads you to hear
domeſtic occurrences, otherwiſe I ſhould ſcarce have troubled you with
the records of a private family, almoſt ruined by excreſcencies of virtue.
The ſame overflowing humanity runs through the whole conduct of the dear
wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom I have mentioned. Even in trifles ſhe is full of works of
ſupererogation. Our doors are perpetually ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with beggars, where
the halt, the maimed and the blind aſſemble in as great numbers, as at the
door of the <pb n="593" facs="tcp:1252700302:168"/> 
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Chapel in
<hi>Lincoln's Inn-Fields.</hi> She not only gives them money, but ſends them
out great quantities of bread, beer, and cold victuals; and ſhe has her
different <hi>penſioners</hi> (as ſhe herſelf calls them) for every day
in the week. But the expence attending theſe out-door petitioners (many of
whom have from time to time been diſcovered to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors) is nothing in
compariſon to the ſums that are almoſt daily drawn from her by begging
letters. It is impoſſible to imagine a calamity, by which ſhe has not
been a ſufferer, in relieving thoſe who have extorted money from her, by
pretended misfortunes. The poor lady has been much hurt by loſſes in trade,
has been a great ſufferer by fire, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone many hardſhips from
ſickneſs and other unforeſeen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and it was but yeſterday that
ſhe paid a long apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's bill brought on by a violent fever. Thus, Sir,
though my wife goes into but little company, and the family-expences are to all
appearance very ſmall, yet my wife's ſuperabundant Good-nature is ſuch
perpetual drawback on her oeconomy, that we run out conſiderably. This
extravagant and ill-judged Generoſity renders all her numerous excellencies
of none effect: and I have often known her almoſt deſtitute of cloaths,
becauſe ſhe had diſtributed her whole wardrobe among lyars, ſycophants,
and hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>THUS, Sir, as briefly as I can I have ſet before you my
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy caſe. I am periſhing by degrees, not by any real extravagance, any
deſigned ruin, or any indulgence of luxury and riot in the perſon who
deſtroys me. On the contrary, no woman can exceed my wife in the ſimplicity
of her dreſs, the humility of her deſires, or the contented eaſineſs of
her nature. What name, Sir, ſhall I give to my misfortunes? They proceed not
from vice, nor even from folly: they proceed from too tender a heart; a heart
that hurries away, or abſorbs all judgment and reflection. To call theſe
errors the fruits of Good-nature is too mild a definition: 
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:1252700302:169"/> and yet to give them an harſher appellation, is
unkind. Let me ſuffer what I will, I muſt kiſs the dear hand that ruins
me.</p>
                     <p>IN my tender hours of ſpeculation I would willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
my wife's faults to our climate, and the natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our
natives. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are Good-natured, they are generally ſo
to exceſs: and as I have not ſeen this particular character delineated in
any of your papers, I have endeavoured to paint it myſelf: and ſhall draw
to the concluſion of my letter by one piece of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Not to be</hi>
GENEROUS <hi>overmuch.</hi> The higheſt acts of Generoſity are ſeldom
repaid in any other coin, but baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ingratitude: and we ought ever
to remember, that out of ten lepers cleaned, one only came back to return
thanks; the reſt were made whole, and went their way.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T this ſeaſon of the year, while the ſtreets reſound
with the cry of <hi>New Almanacks,</hi> and every ſtall is covered with News
from the Stars, Diaries, Predictions, Complete Ephemeris, &amp;c. drawn up by
<hi>Partridge, Parker, Vincent Wing,</hi> and the reſt of the ſagacious
body of Philomaths and Aſtrologers, give me leave to acquaint you of my
intentions of appearing annually in a like capacity. You muſt know, Sir, that
having obſerved, that among the great variety of Almanacks now publiſhed,
there is not one contrived for the uſe of people of faſhion, I have
reſolved to remedy this defect by publiſhing one every year 
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:1252700302:171"/> under the title of the <hi>Court Calendar,</hi>
calculated for the Meridian of St. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>THE plan, which has been hitherto followed by our
Almanack-makers, can be of no uſe whatever to the polite world, who are as
widely ſeparated in their manner of living from the common herd of people as
the inhabitants of the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> To know the exact Riſing and
Setting of the Sun may ſerve to direct the vulgar tradeſman and mechanic
when to open ſhop or go to work: but perſons of faſhion, whoſe hours
are not marked by the courſe of that planet, are indifferent about its
motions; and like thoſe who live under the Equinoctial Line, have their days
and nights of an equal degree of length all the year round. The Red-letter days
pointed out in our common Almanacks may perhaps be obſerved by ſome formal
ladies, who regulate their going to church by them: but people of quality
percieve no difference between the Moveable or Immoveable Feaſts and Faſts,
and know no uſe of Sunday, but as it ſerves to call them to the card-table.
What advantage can a beau reap from <hi>Rider</hi>'s Liſt of the Fairs, which
can only be of ſervice to his groom? or what uſe can any gentleman or lady
make of thoſe Diaries now inſcribed to them; which are filled with Algebra
and the Mathematics? In a word, the preſent uncouth way of dividing the
months into Saints Days, Sundays, and the like, is no more adapted to the
preſent modes of polite life, than the <hi>Roman</hi> diviſion into
<hi>Ides, Nones,</hi> and <hi>Calends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>INSTEAD of ſuppoſing, with the vulgar tribe of
aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers, that the day begins at ſunriſe, my day, which will commence
at the time that it uſually breaks in faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <pb n="597" facs="tcp:1252700302:172"/>
apartments, will be determined by the Riſing of people of quality. Thus the
morning dawns with early riſers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eleven and twelve; and noon
commences at four, when, at this time of the year, the dinner and wax-lights
come in together. For want of a thorough knowledge of the diſtribution of the
day, all who have any connection with the polite world might be guilty of many
miſtakes: and when an honeſt man from <hi>Cornhill</hi> intended a nobleman
a viſit after dinner, he would perhaps find him ſipping his morning
chocolate. The inconveniences of the old ſtyle in our manner of reckoning the
days were ſo manifeſt, that it was thought proper to amend them by act of
parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. I am reſolved in like manner, to introduce the new ſtyle of
dividing the hours alſo into my Almanack: for can any thing be more abſurd
than to fix the name of morning, noon, and evening, &amp;c. at preſent on the
ſame hours, which bore them in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> A
Dutcheſs is ſo far from dining at eleven, that it often happens that Her
Grace has not then opened her eyes on the tea-table; and a Maid of Honour would
no more riſe at five or ſix in the morning, as it was called by the early
dames of Queen <hi>Beſs</hi>'s court, than ſhe would, in imitation of
thoſe dames, breakfaſt upon ſtrong beer and beef-ſteaks. Indeed in
thoſe houſes, where the hours of quality are obſerved by only one part of
the family, the impolite irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of the other, in adhering to the old
ſtyle, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions great diſturbance, for as Lady <hi>Townly</hi> ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"ſuch a houſe is worſe than an inn with
ten ſtage coaches. What between the impertinent people of buſineſs in a
morning, and the intolerable thick ſhoes of footmen at noon, one has not a
wink of ſleep all night."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="598" facs="tcp:1252700302:173"/>THE reformation which I have alſo made
in reſpect to the Red-letter-days is no leſs conſiderable. I have not
only wiped away that immenſe catalogue of Saints which croud the
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Calendar, but have alſo blotted out all the other Saints
that ſtill retain their places in our common Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks: well-knowing that
perſons of faſhion pay as little attention to the Apoſtles and
Evangeliſts, as to St. <hi>Mildred,</hi> St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> or St.
<hi>Winifred.</hi> Indeed I retain the old name of St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe
I am ſure, that people of quality will not think of any body's being
deſigned under that title, except the late Lord <hi>Bolingbroke.</hi> Having
thus diſcarded the Saints, <hi>people whom nobody knows,</hi> I have taken
care to introduce my readers into the beſt company: for the Red-Letters in my
Calendar will ſerve to diſtinguiſh thoſe days on which the ladies of
the firſt faſhion keep their routes and viſiting days: a work of infinite
uſe as well to the perſons of diſtinction themſelves, as to all thoſe
who have any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional intercourſe with the polite world. That ſeaſon
of the year commonly diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>Lent,</hi>
which implies a time of faſting, I ſhall conſider, according to its real
ſignification in the <hi>Beau Monde,</hi> as a yearly <hi>feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>;
and ſhall therefore mention it under the denomination of <hi>The
Carnival.</hi> The propriety of this will be evident at firſt ſight,
ſince nothing is ſo plain, as that at this ſeaſon all kinds of
diverſion and jollity are at the height in this metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis. Inſtead of the
<hi>Man in the Almanack,</hi> I at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (in imitation of Mr.
<hi>Dodſley</hi>'s Memorandum Book) to delineate the figure of a fine
gentleman dreſt <hi>à la mode:</hi> but I was at length determined, by
the advice of ſome inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious friends, to ſuffer the old picture to remain
there; ſince as it appears to be run through the body in ſeveral places, it
may not improperly repreſent that faſhionable character a Duelliſt.</p>
                     <p>IN the place which is allotted in other Almanacks for the
change of weather, (as hail, froſt, ſnow, cloudy, and <pb n="599" facs="tcp:1252700302:174"/> the like) I ſhall ſet down the change of dreſs, adapted to
different ſeaſons, and ranged under the titles of hats, capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,
cardinals, ſacks, negligees, gauſe handkerchiefs, ermine tippets, muffs,
&amp;c. and in a parallel column (according to the cuſtom of other Almanacks)
I ſhall point out the ſeveral parts of the body, affected by theſe
changes; ſuch as head, neck, breaſt, ſhoulders, face, hands, feet, legs,
&amp;c. And as Mr. <hi>Rider</hi> accompanies every month with ſeaſonable
cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about ſowing turnips, raiſing cabbages, blood-letting, and ſuch
other important articles, I ſhall give ſuch direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as are moſt
ſuitable to the beau-monde: as a ſpecimen of which I ſhall beg leave to
lay before you the following Obſervations on the month of May.</p>
                     <q> 
                        <p>IF the ſeaſon proves favourable, it will be proper at the
beginning of this month to attend to the cultivation of your public gardens.
Trim your trees, put your walks in order, look after your lamps, have ballads
written, and ſet to muſic, for the enſuing ſummer. Ladies and gentlemen
muſt be careful not to catch cold in croſſing the water, or by
expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to the damp air in the dark walk at
<hi>Vaux-hall.</hi>
                        </p> 
                        <p>Towards the middle of this month the air at both play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
will begin to be too cloſe and ſultry for ladies, that paint, to riſk the
loſs of their complexion in them.</p> 
                        <p>About the end of this month it will be expedient for thoſe

                           <p>AS my Aunt <hi>Singleton</hi> has publickly given her
honour, that ſhe will never read any of your future papers, I think I may
venture to ſend you a letter without fear of her diſcovery: an incident,
which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be of cruel conſequence to me, as I know ſhe can never
forgive. I am not under any apprehenſions of being betrayed by her friends.
She has but few, and thoſe are a ſort that rather chuſe to ſooth her
weakneſſes than to raiſe her choler; not knowing whether, in her hours of
peeviſhneſs, ſome of her bile may not fall upon themſelves.</p>
                           <p>I OWN I was much ſurpriſed to find my name in print, and
to ſee my picture drawn at full length. I obſerve that my guardian Aunt,
like all painters whether male or female, has dipped her pencil in the colours
of flattery: and accordingly ſhe has drawn me, if not entirely perfect, at
leaſt only with ſuch faults, as are rather commendable, than otherwiſe. 
<q rend="inline">"A ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in company, and too much
ſubmiſſion to judgments not ſo good as my own,"</q> are failings
natural to my youth and want of experience, which time, and an introduction
into proper company, very different from ſuch as I ſee at my Aunt's
tea-table, will ſoon cure: but I am ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that neither the
progreſs of time, the gifts of fortune, nor the ſucceſs of improvement,
can render me, what ſhe has already painted me, 
<q> 
                                 <l>A faultleſs monſter whom the world ne'er

                           </p>
                           <p>SHE affirms, 
<q rend="inline">"that I ſing and play to great
perfection."</q> Upon my word, Sir, I have no voice. She teizes me ſometimes
to ſquall forth a Solo, and I obey, becauſe as ſhe juſtly tells you, 
<q rend="inline">"I tremble at her look,"</q> which, if it
had the family power of one of her antient anceſtors, muſt long ſince
have turned me into ſtone. But what is the effect of my ſong? Alas it
generally proves, only an incantation to rouſe the lapd-og out of a ſound
ſleep upon his cuſhion, or to ſet the parrot and the mackaw into a chorus
of ſcreaming, that would if poſſible, awaken our neighbours the dead, in
<hi>St. Giles's Church Yard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>SHE hints, that 
<q rend="inline">"I am in love with a certain military
Gentleman of no fortune,"</q> and ſhe adds that 
<q rend="inline">"he is modeſt, brave, ſtudious, and
polite."</q> That an officer comes often to our houſe is ſtrictly true.
That he has no fortune is no leſs ſo. But that I am in love with him is
abſolutely falſe, nor are his viſits to me. They are to my Aunt, whom he
certainly 
<q rend="inline">"would prefer to any dowager whatever
without a jointure;"</q> and who, to my knowledge, would be highly pleaſed,
notwithſtanding her family pride, to change the name of <hi>Singleton</hi>
into <hi>O-Kelly.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>THIS leads me to let you into the real cauſe, why ſhe
prefers <hi>The</hi> WORLD to all other weekly eſſays whatever. The
partiality does not ariſe from the merit of the performance in general, but
from the ſubject of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paper, (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 28.) which conſtantly lies
upon her table, hid under the work-baſket, and which ſtrongly recommends by
various precepts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples the admiration and love of OLD WOMEN.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM one of thoſe idle people, (of whom you have lately
given an account) who not being bred to any buſineſs, or able to get a
livelihood by work, have taken up the more ſervile trade of an
<hi>Hanger-on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I FIRST ſerved my time with an old nobleman in the country;
and as I was a diſtant relation of his lordſhip's, I was 
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:1252700302:177"/> admitted to the honour of attending him in the double
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of valet, and apothecary. My buſineſs in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to wait
on him at dreſſing time; to hold the baſon while he waſhed his hands,
buckle his ſhoes, and tye on his neck-cloth. Beſides this, his lordſhip
had ſuch a regard for me, that nobody but myſelf was ever truſted with
cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his corns, or paring his toe-nails: and whenever he was ſick, it was
always my office to hold his head during the operation of an emetic, to attend
him in the water-cloſet when he took a cathartic, and ſometimes to
adminiſter a clyſter. If his lordſhip had no company, I was, indeed,
permitted to ſit at table with him: but when he received any viſiters more
grand than ordinary, I was equipped (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome of the
beſt-looking tenants) in a tye-wig, full-trimmed coat and laced-waiſtcoat,
in order to ſwell the retinue of his ſervants out of livery. I bore my
ſlavery with the greateſt degree of patience; as my lord would often hint
to me, that I was provided for in his will. However, I had the mortification to
find myſelf ſupplanted in his good graces by the Chaplain, who had always
looked upon me as his rival, and contrived at length to out-wheedle, out-fawn,
and out-cringe me. In a word, my lord died:—and while the Chaplain (who
conſtantly prayed by him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his laſt illneſs) had the conſolation
of having a good benefice ſecured to him in the will, my name was huddled
among thoſe of the common ſervants, with no higher le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy than twenty
guineas to buy mourning.</p>
                     <p>WITH this ſmall pittance (beſides what I had made a
ſhift to ſqueeze out of the tenants and tradeſmen, as fees for my good
word, when I had his lordſhip's ear) I came up to town; and embarked all I
was worth in fitting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <pb n="603" facs="tcp:1252700302:178"/> out as a gentleman. Soon
after, as good luck would have it, the nephew and heir of my old lord came from
abroad: when I contrived to wind me into his favour by abuſing his deceaſed
uncle, and fattened my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon him. It is true, he ſupported me; admitted
me into an equal ſhare of his purſe: but conſidering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to
which I was conſtantly expoſed on his account, I regarded his bounties as
only plaiſters to my ſores. My head, back and ribs have received many a
payment, which ſhould have been placed to his lordſhip's account: and I
once narrowly eſcaped being hanged for murdering a poor fellow, whom my lord
in a frolick had run through the body. My patron, among other marks of his
taſte, kept a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and I, as his particular crony and a man of
honour, was allowed to viſit her. It happened one evening he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
ſurpriſed us in ſome unguarded familiarities together. But my lord was
ſo far from being enraged at it, that he only turned madam out of the room,
and very coolly kicked me down ſtairs after her.</p>
                     <p>I WAS now thrown upon the wide world again: but as I never
wanted aſſurance, I ſoon made myſelf very familiarly acquainted with a
young gentleman from <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was juſt come over to
<hi>England</hi> to ſpend his eſtate here. I muſt own, I had ſome
difficulty in keeping on good terms with this new friend; as I had ſo many of
his own countrymen to contend with, who all claimed a right of acquaintance
with him, and ſome of them even pretended to be related to him. Beſides,
they all perſuaded the young ſquire, that they had fortunes in different
parts of <hi>Ireland</hi>; though not one of them had any real eſtate any
more than myſelf: though, indeed, I alſo had a nominal 1500<hi>l. per
Ann.</hi> in <pb n="604" facs="tcp:1252700302:179"/> the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Theſe furious
fellows (for, Sir, they would all fight) gave me much trouble: however, I found
out my young friend's foible, and in ſpite of his countrymen became his
inſeparable companion. He was not only very fond of women, but had a
particular paſſion for new faces; and to humour this inclination, I was
perpetually on the look-out to diſcover freſh pieces for him. I brought him
mantua-makers, milliners, and ſervant-maids in abundance; and at length grew
ſo great a favourite by having prevailed on one of my own couſins to comply
with his propoſals, that I verily believe he would ſoon have made me eaſy
for life in an handſome annuity, if he had not been unfortunately run through
the body in a duel by one of his own countrymen.</p>
                     <p>I NEXT got into favour with an old colonel of the guards, who
happened to take a fancy to me one evening at the <hi>Tilt Yard</hi>
coffee-houſe, for having carried off a pint bumper more than a lieutenant of
a man of war, that had challenged my toaſt. As his ſole delight was
centered in the bottle, all he required of me was to drink glaſs for glaſs
with him; which I readily complied with, as he always paid my reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When
ſober he was the beſt-humoured man in the world: but he was very apt to be
quarrelſome and extremely miſchievous when in liquor. He has more than once
flung a bottle at my head, and emptied the contents of a bowl of punch in my
face: ſometimes he has diverted himſelf by ſetting fire to my ruffles,
ſhaking the aſhes of his pipe over my perriwig, or making a thruſt at me
with the red-hot poker: and I remember he once ſouſed me all over with the
urine of the whole company, by clapping a large pewter Jordan topſy-turvy
upon my head. All theſe indignities <pb n="605" facs="tcp:1252700302:180"/> I very patiently
put up with, as he was ſure to make me double amends for them the next
morning: and I was very near procuring a commiſſion in the army through his
intereſt, when to my great diſappointment he was ſuddenly carried off by
an apoplexy.</p>
                     <p>YOU will be ſurpriſed when I tell you, that I next
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſqueeze myſelf into the good opinion of a rich old
curmudgeon, a city-merchant, and one of the circumciſed. He could have no
objection to my religion, as I uſed to ſpend every Sunday with him at his
country-houſe, where I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred playing at cards to going to church. Nor
could I, indeed, get any thing out of him beyond a dinner: but I had higher
points in view. As he had nobody to inherit his fortune but an only daughter,
(who was kept always in the country) I became ſo deſperately in love with
her, that I would even have turned <hi>Jew</hi> to obtain her. Inſtead of
that, I very fooliſhly made a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of her, and we were
privately married at the <hi>Fleet.</hi> When I came to break the matter to the
father, and to make an apology for having converted her, he received me with a
loud laugh. 
<q rend="inline">"Sir, ſays he, if my child had married the
DEVIL, he ſhould have had every penny that was her due. But—as ſhe is
only my Baſtard, the law cannot oblige me to give her a farthing."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS I found to be too true: and very happily for me my
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> wife had ſo little regard for her new religion, that
ſhe again became an apoſtate, and was taken into keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to which I
readily gave my conſent) by one of her own tribe and complexion. I ſhall
not tire you with a particular detail of what has happened to me ſince: I
ſhall only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <pb n="606" facs="tcp:1252700302:181"/> you, that I have exactly followed
the precept of 
<q rend="inline">"becoming all things to all men."</q> I was
once ſupported very ſplendidly by a young rake of quality for my wit in
talking blaſphemy and ridiculing the bible, till my patron ſhot himſelf
through the head: and I lived at bed and board with an old Methodiſt lady for
near a twelve-month on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my zeal for the New Doctrine, till one of
the maid-ſervants wickedly laid a child to me. At preſent, Mr. TOWN, I am
quite out of employ; having juſt loſt a very profitable place, which I held
under a great man in quality of his Pimp. My diſgrace was owing to the
baſeneſs of an old <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> acquaintance, whom I palmed upon
his honour for an innocent creature juſt come out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: but the
huſſy was ſo ungrateful, as to beſtow on both of us convincing marks of
her thorough knowledge of the town.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the appointed time of our publication now happens to fall on
New-year's-day, I cannot open the buſineſs of the year with a better grace,
than by taking the preſent hour for the ſubject of this paper: a ſubject,
which pleaſes me the more, as it alſo gives me an opportunity of paying my
readers the compliments of the ſeaſon, and moſt ſincerely wiſhing
them all <hi>a happy new year, and a great many of them.</hi> But in order to
make theſe civilities of more conſequence than a bare compliment, I will
alſo endeavour to give them a little <pb n="608" facs="tcp:1252700302:183"/> wholeſome
advice, by which they may be moſt likely to enſure to themſelves that
happineſs, and to go through the enſuing year with eaſe and
tranquility.</p>
               <p>No God in the heathen <hi>Pantheon</hi> was expreſſed by
properer emblems, or more ſignificantly repreſented, than <hi>Janus,</hi>
whom we may fairly ſtile, in our language, the God of the New Year. The
medals on which the image of this Deity was engraved bore two faces, not ogling
each other like thoſe on the ſhillings of <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> nor cheek by jowl like the double viſage on the coin of
<hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> but turned from each other, one looking
forwards, as it were, into futurity, and the other taking a retroſpective
view of what was paſt. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſurely be deviſed a ſtronger, or
more ſenſible leſſon of moral inſtruction, than this figure teaches
us. This double view comprehends in itſelf the ſum of human prudence; for
the moſt perfect reaſon can go no higher than wiſely to gueſs at the
future, by reflecting on the paſt; and morality is never ſo likely to
perſevere in a ſteady and uniform courſe, as when it ſets out with a
fix'd determination of mutually regulating the New Year by a recollection of
the Old, and at the ſame time making the ſucceeding a critique on the
laſt.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the faults in the general conduct of mankind, and
their frequent miſcarriages in their moſt favourite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, will be
found, upon examination, to reſult from an imperfect and partial view of what
relates to their duty or undertakings. Some regulate their actions by blind
gueſs, and raſhly preſuming on the future, without the leaſt attention
to the paſt. With theſe the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of the paſſions gives their
reaſon no ſcope to exert itſelf, but, neglecting the premiſes, they
jump to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. Others, who are often taken for men of deep 
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:1252700302:184"/> reflection and marvellous underſtanding, meditate ſo
profoundly on the paſt, that they ſcarce take any notice either of the
preſent or the future. To theſe two cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, whoſe miſconduct
ariſes from two ſuch contrary ſources, may indeed be added a third,
whoſe wild irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular behaviour is founded on no fix'd principles, but
proceeds from a total abſence of thought and reflection. Theſe eaſy
creatures act entirely at random, neither troubling themſelves with what has
been, what is, or what will be; and, as the image of <hi>Janus</hi> ſeems to
bear two heads, theſe thoughtleſs vacant animals may almoſt be ſaid to
have no head at all.</p>
               <p>But that the neceſſity of taking this comprehensive view of
our affairs may appear in the ſtronger light, let us conſider the many
difficulties in which men of any of the above characters are involved from a
total neglect or partial ſurvey of matters that ſhould influence their
conduct. The firſt ſort of men, who nouriſh great expectations from the
future, and ſuffer hope to lay their prudence to ſleep, are very common:
Indeed almoſt every man, like the dairy-maid with her pail of milk, pleaſes
himſelf with calculating the advantages he ſhall reap from his
undertakings. There is ſcarce a ſervitor at either univerſity, who, when
he takes orders, does not think it more than poſſible he may one day be a
biſhop, or at leaſt head of a college, though perhaps at firſt he is glad
to ſnap at a curacy. Every walking attendant on our hoſpitals flatters
himſelf that a few years will ſettle him in high practice and a chariot:
and among thoſe few gentlemen of the inns of court, who really deſerve the
name of ſtudents, there is hardly one who ſits down to Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
without imagining that he may himſelf, ſome time or other, be Lord
Chancellor. At this early period <pb n="610" facs="tcp:1252700302:185"/> of life theſe vain
hopes may perhaps ſerve as ſpurs to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and virtue; but what ſhall
we ſay to thoſe people, who in ſpite of experience and repeated
diſappointments, ſtill place their chief dependance on groundleſs
expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from their future fortune? This Town ſwarms with people who
rely almoſt ſolely on contingencies: and our goals are often filled with
wretches who brought on their own poverty and misfortunes, by promiſing
themſelves great profit from ſome darling ſcheme, which has at laſt
been attended with bankruptcy. The preſent extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of many of our
ſpend-thrifts is built on ſome ideal riches of which they are ſoon to be
in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and which they are laying out as freely, as the girl in
the farce ſquanders the ten thouſand pounds ſhe was to get in the
lottery. I am myſelf acquainted with a young fellow who had great
expectations from an old uncle. He had ten thouſand pounds of his own in
ready money; and as the old gentleman was a good deal turned of ſixty, the
nephew very conſiderately computed, that his uncle could hardly laſt above
five years, during which time he might go on very genteely at the rate of
2000<hi>l. per ann.</hi> However the old gentleman held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above ſeven
years, the two laſt of which our young ſpark had no conſolation but the
daily hopes of his uncle's death. The happy hour at length arrived; the will
was tore open with rapture; when, alas! the fond youth diſcovered, that he
had never once reflected, that though he had a ticket in the wheel, it might
poſſibly come up a blank, and had the mortification to find himſelf
disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not dwell ſo particularly on the ridiculous folly of
thoſe profound ſpeculatiſts, who fix their attention en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on what is
paſt, without making their reflections of ſervice either for the preſent
or the future, becauſe it is not a very common or tempting ſpecies of
abſurdity: <pb n="611" facs="tcp:1252700302:186"/> but ſhall rather adviſe the reader to
conſider the time paſt, as the ſchool of experience, from which he may
draw the moſt uſeful leſſons for his future conduct. This kind of
retroſpect would teach us to provide with fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight againſt the
calamities to which our inexperience has hitherto expoſed us, though at the
ſame time it would not throw us ſo far back, as to keep us lagging, like
the Old Stile, behind the reſt of the world. To ſay the truth, thoſe
ſage perſons who are given to ſuch deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, as to let to-day and
to-morrow paſs unregarded by meditating on yeſterday, are as ridiculous in
their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as country beaux in their dreſs, who adopt the town modes,
juſt after they are become unfaſhionable in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is no taſk ſo difficult as to infuſe ideas into
a brain hitherto entirely unaccuſtomed to thinking: for how can we warn a man
to avoid the misfortunes which may hereafter befal him, or to improve by the
calamities he has already ſuffered, whoſe actions are not the reſult of
thought, or guided by experience? Theſe perſons are, indeed, of all others,
the moſt to be pitied. They are prodigal and abandoned in their conduct, and
by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious exceſſes ruin their conſtitution, till at length poverty and
death ſtare them in the face together; or if, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, their crazy
frame holds together after the utter deſtruction of their fortune, they
finiſh a thoughtleſs life by an act of deſperation, and a piſtol puts
an end to their miſeries.</p>
               <p>Since then good fortune cannot be expected to fall into our
laps, and it requires ſome thought to enſure to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a likelihood
of ſucceſs in our undertakings, let us look back with attention on the old
year, and gather inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from it in what manner to conduct ourſelves
through <pb n="612" facs="tcp:1252700302:187"/> the New. Let us alſo endeavour to draw from it
a leſſon of morality: and I hope it will not be thought too ſolemn a
concluſion of this paper, if I adviſe my readers to carry this reflection
even into religion. This train of thought, that teaches us at once to reflect
on the paſt, and look forward to the future, will alſo naturally lead us to
look up with awe and admiration towards that Being who has exiſted from all
eternity, and ſhall exiſt world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. No idea can give us a more
exalted idea of the Power who firſt created us, and whoſe providence is
always over us. Let us then conſider with attention this pagan image, by
which we may add force to our morality, and prudence to our ordinary conduct;
nor let us bluſh to receive a leſſon from Heathens, which may animate our
zeal and reverence for the Author of Chriſtianity.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been my good fortune to be born of a family, that is
recorded in the Herald's Dictionary, as one of the moſt antient in the
kingdom: We are ſuppoſed to have come into <hi>England</hi> with
<hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. Upon my acceſſion ſome years ago to my
elder brother's eſtate and title of a Baronet, I received a viſit from
<hi>Rouge Dragon,</hi>
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Purſuivant at Arms, to congratulate
me upon my new rank of a <hi>Vavaſour,</hi> and to know whether I ſhould
chuſe to bear the <hi>dexter baſe points of the Lady Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel's Saltire in
chief,</hi> or only her <hi>Siniſter corners</hi>; ſhe being one of the
ſeventeen coheireſſes of my great great great <pb n="614" facs="tcp:1252700302:189"/>
great great grandfather's fourth wife <hi>Dorothy,</hi> the daughter and ſole
heireſs of <hi>Simon de la Frogpool</hi> of <hi>Croakham</hi> in
<hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi> This unexpected viſit muſt have diſconcerted me to an
invincible degree, if upon recollection I had not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered Mr.
<hi>Rouge Dragon</hi> as a conſtant companion to my late brother, but as a
kind of tutor in initiating him into the Science of Heraldy, and the Civil and
Military Atchievements, to which our nobility and gentry are entitled. As
ſoon, therefore, as I could recover myſelf from my firſt ſurpriſe in
hearing an unknown <hi>Engliſh</hi> language, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanked Mr.
<hi>Dragon</hi> for the pains he had taken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my Coat of Arms
ſo minutely, but hoped he would give himſelf no farther trouble upon my
account: becauſe I was fully determined to <hi>bear</hi> the plain
<hi>Shield</hi> of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> without taking the
leaſt notice of Lady <hi>Iſabel's Saltire in chief,</hi> or even of her
<hi>Siniſter corners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BE it to my ſhame or not, I muſt confeſs that Heraldry
is a ſcience, which I have never much cultivated: nor do I find it very
prevalent among the faſhionable ſtudies of the age. Arms, and Armorial
tokens, may, I ſuppoſe, be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly diſtinguiſhed, and properly
emblazoned, upon the family plate to which they belong: but I have obſerved
of late, that theſe honorable enſigns are not confined entirely to their
proper owners, but are uſurped by every body, who thinks fit to take them;
inſomuch that there is ſcarce an hackney coach in <hi>London,</hi> which is
not in poſſeſſion of a Ducal Creſt, an Earl's Coronet, or a Baronet's
Bloody Hand. This has often given me great offence, as it reflects a ſcandal
on our nobility and gentry: and I cannot but think it very indecent for a
Duke's coach to be ſeen waiting at a night-cellar while the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man 
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:1252700302:190"/> is tipping off a glaſs of gin, or for a Counteſs's
landau to ſet down ladies at the door of a common bawdy-houſe. I remember I
was one morning diſturbed at my breakfaſt by a faſhionable rap at my
door; when looking out of my window I ſaw the coach of the lady dowager
— drawn up before it. I was extremely ſurpriſed at ſo early and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected a viſit from her ladyſhip; and while I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to
receive her, I over-heard her ladyſhip at high words with her coachman in my
entry; when ſtepping to the ſtair-caſe I found that they were
ſquabbling together about ſixpence, and ſoon perceived that her
ladyſhip was dwindled into one of my houſe-maids. This badge of nobility,
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at random according to the fancy of the coach-painter, I have
found inconvenient on other occaſions: for I once travelled from
<hi>London</hi> to <hi>Derby</hi> in an hired chariot finely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with a
Viſcount's cypher and coronet; by which noble circumſtance I was compelled
in every inn to pay as a Lord, though I was not at that time even a ſimple
Baronet, or (in the language of my friend Mr. <hi>Dragon)</hi> arrived to the
dignity of a <hi>Vavaſour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I HAVE, indeed, ſometimes doubted, whether nobility and high
rank are of that real advantage, which they are generally eſteemed to be: and
I am almoſt inclined to think, that they anſwer no other deſirable end,
than as far as they indulge our vanity and oſtentation. A long roll of
ennobled anceſtors makes, I confeſs, a very alluring appearance: To ſee
coronet after coronet paſſing before our view in an uninterrupted
ſucceſſion, is the moſt ſoothing proſpect, that perhaps can
preſent itſelf to the eye of human pride: The exaltation that we feel upon
ſuch a review takes riſe in a viſionary and ſecret piece of flattery,
that as glorious, and as <pb n="616" facs="tcp:1252700302:191"/> long, or even a longer line of
future coronets may ſpring from ourſelves, as have depended from our
anceſtors. We read in <hi>Virgil,</hi> that <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> to inſpire
his ſon with the propereſt incitement to virtue, ſhews him a long race of
kings, emperors, and heroes, whom <hi>Aeneas</hi> is fore-doomed to give riſe
to: and the miſery of <hi>Macbeth</hi> is made by <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> to
proceed, leſs from the conſciouſneſs of guilt, than from the
diſappointed pride, that none of his own race ſhall ſucceed him in the
throne.</p>
                     <p>THE pride of anceſtry, and the deſire of continuing our
lineage, when they tend to an incitement of virtuous and noble actions, are
undoubtedly laudable; and I ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have indulged myſelf in the
pleaſing reflection, had not a particular ſtory in a <hi>French</hi> Novel,
which I lately met with, put a ſtop to all vain glories, that can
poſſibly be deduced from a long race of progenitors.</p>

high rank and great fortune,"</q> ſays the Novelliſt, 
<q rend="inline">"died ſuddenly, and without being permitted
to ſtop at Purgatory, was ſent down immediately into Hell. He had not been
long there, before he met with his coachman <hi>Thomas,</hi> who like his noble

ſurpriſed to behold his lordſhip amidſt the ſharpers, thieves,

within your gates, and whoſe fine taſte employed ſuch numbers of poor in
your gardens, by building temples and obeliſks, and by forming lakes of
water, that ſeemed to vye with the largeſt oceans of the creation. Pray, my
lord, if I may be ſo bold, what crime has brought your lordſhip into this

his uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, I have been ſent hither for having defrauded
my royal maſter, and cheating the widows and fatherleſs, ſolely to

always ſeem to be an honeſt, careful, ſober ſervant, what brought thee
hither? Alas! my noble lord, replied <hi>Thomas,</hi> I was ſent hither for
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that Son."</q>

               <p>I MUST agree with my correſpondent, that the ſtudy of
Heraldry is at preſent in very little repute among us; and our nobility are
more anxious about preſerving the genealogy of their horſes, than of their
own family. Whatever value their progenitors may have formerly ſet upon their
Blood, it is now found to be of no value, when put into the ſcale and weighed
againſt ſolid <hi>plebeian</hi> gold: Nor would the moſt illuſtrious
deſcendant from <hi>Cadwallader,</hi> or the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Kings,
ſcruple to debaſe his lineage by an alliance with the daughter of a
city-plumb, though all her anceſtors were yeomen, and none of her family ever
<hi>bore arms.</hi> Titles of quality, when the owners have no other merit to
recommend them, are of no more eſtimation, than thoſe which the courteſy
of the vulgar have beſtowed on the deformed: and when I look over a long Tree
of Deſcent, I ſometimes fancy I can diſcover the real characters of
<hi>Sharpers, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,</hi> and <hi>Plunderers of their Country,</hi>
concealed under the titles of <hi>Dukes, Earls,</hi> and
<hi>Viſcounts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is well known, that the very ſervants, in the abſence of
their maſter, aſſume the ſame titles; and <hi>Tom</hi> or
<hi>Harry,</hi> the butler or groom of his Grace, is always <hi>my Lord
Duke</hi> 
                  <pb n="618" facs="tcp:1252700302:193"/> in the kitchen or ſtables. For this reaſon
I have thought proper to preſent my reader with the Pedigree of a Footman,
drawn up in the ſame ſounding titles, as are ſo pompouſly diſplayed
on theſe occasions: and I dare ſay it will appear no leſs illuſtrious,
than the pedigrees of many families, which are neither celebrated for their
actions, nor diſtinguiſhed by their virtues.</p>
               <p>THE Family of the SKIPS, or SKIP-KENNELS, is very antient and
noble. The founder of it <hi>Maitre Jaques</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> with
the Dutcheſs of Mazarine. He was ſon of a Prince of the Blood, his mother
one of the <hi>Meſdames</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> This family is therefore
related to the moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious <hi>Maitres d' Hotèl</hi> and
<hi>Valets de Chambre</hi> of that kindgom. <hi>Jaques</hi> had iſſue two
Sons, <hi>viz. Robert</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>; of whom <hi>Paul</hi> the
youngeſt was inveſted with the purple before he was eighteen, and made a
Biſhop, and ſoon after became an Archbiſhop. <hi>Robert,</hi> the elder,
came to be a Duke, but died without iſſue: <hi>Paul,</hi> the Archbiſhop,
left behind him an only daughter, <hi>Barbara,</hi> baſe-born, who was
afterwards Maid of Honour; and inter-marrying with a Lord of the Bed-chamber,
had a very numerous iſſue by him; <hi>viz. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi> born a week after
their marriage, and died young; <hi>Joſeph,</hi> firſt a Squire, afterwards
Knighted, High Sheriff of a County, and Colonel of the Militia; <hi>Peter,</hi>
raiſed from a Cabin-Boy to a Lord of the Admiralty; <hi>William,</hi> a
Faggot in the Firſt Regiment of the Guards, and a Brigadier;
<hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> at firſt an Earl's Eldeſt Son, and afterwards Lord Mayor
of the City of <hi>London.</hi> The ſeveral branches of this family were no
leſs diſtinguiſhed for their illuſtrious progeny. <hi>Jaques</hi> the
founder, firſt quartered lace on his coat, and <hi>Robert</hi> added the
ſhoulder-knot. Some of them, indeed, met with great trouble: Archbiſhop
<hi>Paul</hi> loſt his See for getting a cook-maid with child;
<hi>Barbara,</hi> the Maid of Honour, was diſmiſſed with a big belly;
Brigadier <hi>William</hi> was killed by a Chairman in a pitched battle at an
ale-houſe; the Lord of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty was tranſported for ſeven years;
and Duke <hi>Robert</hi> had the misfortune to be hanged at
<hi>Tyburn.</hi>

                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is my fortune to be married to a lady, who is an
extraordinary good houſewife, and is cried up by all the good women of her
acquaintance, for being the <hi>neateſt body in her houſe</hi> they ever
knew. This, Sir, is my grievance: This ſuperabundant Neatneſs is ſo very
troubleſome and diſguſting to me, that I proteſt I had rather lodge in
a carrier's inn, or take up my abode with the horſes in the ſtables.</p>
                     <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that a due regard to Neatneſs
and Cleanlineſs is as neceſſary to be obſerved in our habitations 
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:1252700302:195"/> as our perſons: But though I ſhould not chuſe to
have my hands begrimed like a chimney-ſweeper's, I would not, as among the
ſuperſtitious <hi>Mahometans,</hi> waſh them ſix times a day: And
though I ſhould be loth to roll in a pig-ſtye, yet I do not like to have my
houſe rendered uſeleſs to me under the pretence of keeping it clean.</p>
                     <p>FOR my own part, I cannot ſee the difference between having
an houſe that is always dirty, and an houſe that is always to be cleaned. I
could very willingly compound to be waſhed out of my home, with other
maſters of families, every Saturday night: But my wife is ſo very notable,
that the ſame cleanſing work muſt be repeated every day in the week. All
the morning long I am ſure to be entertained with the domestic concert of
ſcrubbing the floors, ſcouring the irons, and beating the carpets; and I am
conſtantly hunted from room to room, while one is to be duſted, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dry-rubbed, another waſhed, and another run over with a dry mop. Thus,
indeed, I may be ſaid to live in continual dirtineſs, that my houſe may
be clean: For during theſe nice operations every apartment is ſtowed with
ſoap, brickduſt, ſand, ſcrubbing-bruſhes, hair-brooms, rag-mops, and
diſhclouts.</p>
                     <p>YOU may ſuppoſe, that the greateſt care is taken to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the leaſt ſpeck of dirt from ſoiling the floors: For this
reaſon all that come to our houſe, (beſides the ceremony of ſcraping at
the door,) are obliged to rub their ſhoes for half an hour on a large ragged
mat at the entrance; and then they muſt ſtraddle their way along ſeveral
leſſer mats, ranged at due diſtances from each other in the paſſage,
and (like boys at play) come into the room with a hop, a ſtep, and a 
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:1252700302:196"/> jump. The like caution is uſed by all the family: I
my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf am ſcarce allowed to ſtir a ſtep without ſlippers: my wife
creeps on tip-toe up and down ſtairs: the maid-ſervants are continually
ſtumping below in clogs or pattens; and the footman is obliged to ſneak
about the houſe bare-footed, as if he came with a ſly deſign to ſteal
ſomething.</p>
                     <p>AFTER what has been ſaid you will naturally conclude, that
my wife muſt be no leſs nice in other particulars. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhe cannot
conceive that any thing, which is done by ſo neat a woman, can poſſibly
give offence: I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been in pain for her ſeveral times, when I
have ſeen her, before company, duſt the tea-cups with a foul apron or a
waſhing-gown; and I have more than once bluſhed for her, when through her
extreme cleanlineſs ſhe has not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without breathing into our
drinking-glaſſes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wiping them with her pocket handkerchief.
People, Mr. TOWN, who are very intimate with families, ſeldom ſee them
(eſpecially the female part) but in diſguiſe: and it will be readily
allowed, that a lady wears a very different aſpect, when ſhe comes before
company, than when ſhe firſt ſets down to her toilette. My wife appears
decent enough in her apparel, to thoſe who viſit us in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: but
in the morning ſhe is quite another figure. Her uſual diſhabille then is,
an ordinary ſtuff jacket and petticoat, a double clout thrown over her head
and pinned under her chin, a black greaſy bonnet, and a coarſe dowlas
apron; ſo that you would rather take her for a chair-woman. Nor, indeed does
ſhe ſcruple to ſtoop to the meaneſt drudgery of one: for ſuch is her
love of Cleanlineſs, that I have often ſeen her on her knees whitening an
hearth, or ſpreading dabs of vinegar and fullers earth over the boards.</p>

                        <pb n="622" facs="tcp:1252700302:197"/>IT is obſerved by <hi>Swift,</hi> that

<q rend="inline">"a nice man is a man of naſty ideas:"</q> In
like manner we may affirm, that your very neat people are the moſt ſlovenly
on many occaſions. I have told you my wife's morning trim: but beſides
this, ſhe has another cuſtom, which creates the greateſt diſguſt in
me. You muſt know, Sir, that among other charms ſhe prides herſelf
vaſtly in a fine ſet of teeth: and ſomebody has told her, that nothing is
ſo good for them as to rub them every morning with <hi>Scotch</hi> ſnuff
and faſting ſpittle. As an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is no ſtranger, this recipe is
conſtantly adminiſtered in my preſence before breakfaſt; and after this
delicate appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, her pretty mouth, (which is afterwards wiped for
<hi>me</hi> to kiſs,) in order to preſerve her gums from the ſcurvy,
muſt be rinced—would you believe it?—with her own water.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL dwell no longer on this ſubject, as I fear it may
prove ſurfeiting both to you and your readers: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude
with telling you, that this ſcrupulous delicacy of my wife in the Neatneſs
of her houſe was the means of our loſing a very good fortune. A rich old
uncle, on whom we had great dependance, came up to town laſt ſummer on
purpoſe to pay us a viſit: but though he had rode above ſixty miles that
day, he was obliged to ſtand in the paſſage till his boots were pulled
off, for fear of ſoiling the <hi>Turkey</hi> carpet. After ſupper the old
gentleman, as was his conſtant practice, deſired to have his pipe: but this
you may be ſure could by no means be allowed, as the filthy ſtench of the
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco would never be got out of the furniture again; and it was with much
ado, that my wife would even ſuffer him to go down and ſmoke in the
kitchen. We had no room <pb n="623" facs="tcp:1252700302:198"/> lodge him in except a garret
with nothing but bare walls; becauſe the Chints bed-chamber was, indeed, too
nice for a dirty country ſquire. Theſe ſlights very much chagrined my
good uncle: but he had not been with us above a day or two, before my wife and
he came to an open quarrel; and the occaſion of it was this. It happened,
that he had brought a favourite pointer with him, who at his firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
was immediately locked up in the coal-hole: but the dog having found means to
eſcape, had crept ſlily up ſtairs, and (beſides other marks of his want
of delicacy) had very calmly ſtretched himſelf out upon a crimſon
damaſk ſettee. My wife not only ſentenced him to the diſcipline of the
whip, but inſiſted upon having the criminal hanged up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; when the
maſter interpoſing in his behalf, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch high words between
them, that my uncle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his horſe, and ſwore he would never <hi>darken
our doors</hi> again as long as he breathed. He went home, and about two months
after died: but as he could not forgive the ill treatment, which both he and
his dog had met with at our houſe, he had altered his will, which before he
had made entirely in our favour.</p>

               <p>IT may not be improper, as my correſpondent has but ſlightly
touched upon this topic, to add a word or two, by way of poſtcript to his
letter, on the extraordinary ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of many notable houſewives in the
care and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their furniture. In middling genteel families it is
not uncommon to have things more for ſhew than uſe: <pb n="624" facs="tcp:1252700302:199"/>
and I cannot but applaud the ingenious thought of a friend of mine, who has
contrived to furniſh his houſe in the moſt elegant taſte at a very
ſmall expence. He is pleaſed, it is true, to eat off your common ſtone
ware, becauſe it looks ſo clean; but you ſee his beaufet crowded with a
variety of curious enamelled China plates, which are ranged in ſuch manner as
to conceal the ſtreaks of white paint that cement the broken pieces together:
he likes to drink his porter out of the original ale-houſe pewter pot; but a
large ſilver tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard always ſtands upon the ſide-board, which the moſt
curious eye cannot at that diſtance diſcover to be <hi>French</hi> plate.
The whole range of rooms in his middle ſtory is moſt grandly fitted up: but
as it would be pity to ſoil ſuch good furniture, his curtains, which we
muſt ſuppoſe to be made of the richeſt damaſk, are carefully pinned
up in paper-bags; and the chairs, of which the ſeats and backs are
undoubtedly of the ſame ſtuff, are no leſs cautiouſly ſkreened with
ordinary-checked linnen. Thus does he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by the appearance of finery,
all the purpoſes of pride and oſtentation:—Like many families, who
being really poſſeſſed of ornamental and uſeful furniture, make no
more uſe of it than the beau blockhead does of his library; which, though it
contains many books finely bound and gilt, is deſigned merely for ſhew, and
it would ſpoil the backs or rumple the leaves to look into the contents of
them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE uſe of language is the ready communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our
thoughts to one another. As we cannot produce the objects which raiſe ideas
in our minds, we uſe words which are made ſigns of thoſe objects
themſelves. No man could convey to another the idea of a table or chair,
without pointing to thoſe pieces of furniture: as children are taught to
remember the names of things by looking at their pictures. Thus if I wanted to
mention King <hi>Charles</hi> on horſe-back, I muſt carry my companion to
<hi>Charing-Croſs</hi>; and would I next tell him of the ſtatue of Sir
<hi>John Barnard,</hi> we muſt trudge back again, and he muſt wait for my
mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'till we got to the <hi>Royal Exchange.</hi> We ſhould be like the
ſages of <hi>Laputa,</hi> who (as <hi>Gulliver</hi> tells us) having
ſubſtituted <hi>things</hi> for <hi>words,</hi> uſed to carry about them 
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:1252700302:201"/> ſuch <hi>things</hi> as were neceſſary to
expreſs the particular buſineſs they were to diſcourſe on. 
<q rend="inline">"I have often beheld (ſays he) two of thoſe
ſages almoſt ſinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among
us: who, when they met in the ſtreets, would lay down their loads, open their
ſacks, and hold converſation for an hour together; then put up their
implements, help each other to reſume their burthens, and take their
leave."</q> In theſe circumſtances a man of the feweſt words could not,
indeed, talk without carrying about him a much larger apparatus of
converſation, than is contained in the bag of the noted <hi>Yeates,</hi> or
any other ſlight-of-hand artiſt: he could not ſpeak of a chicken or an
owl, but it muſt be ready in his pocket to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. In ſuch a caſe
we could not ſay we heard, but we ſaw the converſation of a friend; as in
the epiſtolary correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence carried on by thoſe pretty
<hi>hieroglyphic</hi> letters (as they are called), where the picture of a
<hi>deer</hi> and a <hi>woman finely dreſt</hi> is made to ſtand for the
expreſſion of <hi>dear lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the invention of words has removed theſe difficulties; and
we may talk not only of any thing we have ſeen, but what neither we, nor the
perſons to whom we ſpeak, ever ſaw. Thus we can convey to another the
idea of a battle, without being reduced to the diſagreeable neceſſity of
learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it 
<q rend="inline">"from the cannon's mouth:"</q> and we can talk
of the people in the world of the moon, without being obliged to make uſe of
Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s artificial wings to fly thither. Words, therefore,
in the ordinary courſe of life, are like the paper-money among merchants;
invented as a more ready conveyance, by which the largeſt ſum can be
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the moſt diſtant places with as much eaſe as a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
while the ſame in ſpecie would require bags and cheſts, and even carts or
ſhips to tranſport it. But, however great theſe advantages are, the uſe
of language has brought along with it ſeveral inconveniences, as well as
paper-money: for as this latter is more liable to miſcarry, more eaſily
concealed, <pb n="627" facs="tcp:1252700302:202"/> carried off, or counterfeited than bullion,
merchants have frequent cauſe to complain, that the convenience of this
ſort of caſh is not without ſome alloy of evil; and we find, that in the
uſe of language there is ſo much room for deceit and miſtake, that though
it does not render it uſeleſs, it is much to be wiſhed ſome remedy
could be contrived.</p>
               <p>MEN are ſo apt to uſe the ſame words in different
ſenſes, and to call the ſame thing by different names, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
oftentimes underſtand or be underſtood. If one calls that thing black which
another calls green, or that prodigality which another calls generoſity, they
miſtake each other's meaning; and can never come to agree, 'till they explain
the words. It is to this we owe ſo much wrangling in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſo
many volumes of controverſy on almoſt every part of literature. I have
known a diſpute carried on with great warmth, and when the diſputants have
come to explain what each meant, it has been diſcovered they were both of a
ſide: like the men in the Play, who met and fought firſt, and after each
had been heartily beat found themſelves to be friends. What ſhould we
ſay, if this practice of calling things by their wrong names was to obtain
among tradeſmen? If you was to ſend to your haberdaſher for an hat, you
might receive a pair of ſtockings; or inſtead of a cordial julep from your
apothecary, be furniſhed with a cathartic or a clyſter.</p>
               <p>IT would be needleſs to inſiſt on the inconveniences
ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the miſuſe or miſapprehenſion of terms in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
combats; whether they be fought on the ſpot by word of mouth, or (like a game
of Cheſs) maintained, even tho' lands and ſeas interpoſe, by the
aſſiſtance of the preſs. In our ordinary converſation it is
notorious, that no leſs confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has ariſen from the wrong application
or perverſion of the original and moſt natural import of words. Thus, for
inſtance, the word <hi>Devil,</hi> is uſed at preſent only as a bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
for children; nor will it raiſe in the moſt vulgar minds 
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:1252700302:203"/> the idea even of a cloven foot or the ſmell of
brimſtone: and all we can underſtand by it are, the errand-boy of a
printing-houſe, the name of a tavern, and the broiled giz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a turkey.
The no leſs tremendous words, <hi>damned</hi> and <hi>helliſh,</hi> are
uſurped equally to ſignify any thing ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively good, as well as bad:
and I am almoſt aſhamed to mention, that we cannot wonder a particular
liquor ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>biſhop,</hi> when the
title of the higheſt dignitary of our church has been proſtituted to a more
ſcandalous purpoſe. A mere country put might be ſtartled (at this
juncture eſpecially) at the warlike ſound of a <hi>route,</hi> a
<hi>drum,</hi> or a <hi>drum-major</hi>; which, we know, have been long adopted
by the faſhionable world without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to alarm us with the notion of
a campaign or a battle, but only to call us (without a pun) to more peaceful
engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and he would be very much ſurpriſed to receive a card from a
lady of quality inviting him to an <hi>Hurricane,</hi> or perhaps an
EARTHQUAKE.</p>
               <p>I REMEMBER, when I commenced author, I publiſhed a little
pamphlet, which I flattered myſelf had ſome merit, though I muſt
confeſs it did not ſell. Conſcious of my grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fame, I reſolved to
ſend the firſt fruits of it to an aunt in the country, that my relations
might judge of the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I was likely to prove to the family: but how
was I mortified, when the good lady ſent me word, 
<q rend="inline">"that ſhe was ſorry to find I had
<hi>ruined</hi> myſelf, and had wrote a book; for the parſon of the
pariſh had aſſured her, that authors were never worth a farthing, and
always died in a goal."</q> Notwithſtanding this remonſtrance I have
ſtill perſiſted in my <hi>ruin</hi>; which at preſent I cannot ſay is
quite compleated, as I can make three meals a day, have yet a coat to my back,
with a clean ſhirt for Sundays at leaſt, and am lodged ſomewhat below a
garret. However, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of my aunt has often led me to conſider, in
how many ſenſes different from its general acceptation the word 
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:1252700302:204"/> RUINED is frequently made uſe of. When we hear this
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to another, we ſhould naturally imagine the perſon is reduced to a
ſtate worſe than he was in before, and ſo low that it is ſcarce
poſſible for him to riſe again: but we ſhall often find, inſtead of
his being undone, that he has rather met with ſome extraordinary good
fortune; and that thoſe who pronounce him <hi>ruined,</hi> either mean you
ſhould underſtand it in ſome other light, or elſe call him undone,
becauſe he differs from them in his way of life, or becauſe they wiſh him
to be in that ſituation. I need not point out the extreme cruelty, as well as
injuſtice, in the miſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this term; as it may litterally
<hi>ruin</hi> a man, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his character: according to the old
<hi>Engliſh</hi> proverb, <hi>give a dog an ill name, and hang him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MOST people are, indeed, ſo entirely taken up with their own
narrow views, that, like the jaundiced eye, every thing appears to them of the
ſame colour; and it is no wonder, that they ſhould ſee ruin ſtaring
every man in the face, who happens not to think as they do. From this
ſelfiſh preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice we are led to make a wrong judgment of the motives and
actions of others: I ſhall, therefore, here ſet down a catalogue of ſome
of my own acquaintance, whom the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and good-nature of the world have not
ſcrupled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce abſolutely <hi>ruined.</hi>
               </p>
               <q> 
                  <p>A young clergyman of <hi>Cambridge</hi> might have had a good
college living in about thirty years time, or have been head of the houſe:
but he choſe to quit his fellowſhip for a ſmall cure in town with a view
of recommending himſelf by his preaching—<hi>Ruined.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>A fellow of another college refuſed to quit his books and his
retirement, to live as chaplain with a ſmoking, drinking, ſwearing,
fox-hunting country ſquire, who would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for
him—<hi>Ruined.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Claſſic,</hi> a young phyſician from
<hi>Oxford,</hi> might have had more practice than <hi>Radcliffe</hi> or
<hi>Mead:</hi> but having ſtudied <pb n="630" facs="tcp:1252700302:205"/> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle's
Poetics,</hi> and read the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedies as well as <hi>Galen</hi>
and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> he was tempted to write a play, which was
univerſally applauded—<hi>Ruined.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>A Student of the <hi>Temple</hi> might have made ſure of a
Judge's Robes or the Chancellor's Seals: but being tired of ſaunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
<hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> without even getting half a guinea for a motion,
he has accepted of a commiſſion in one of the new-raiſed regiments, and
is—<hi>Ruined.</hi>
                  </p> 
                  <p>A younger brother of a good family threw himſelf away upon an
obſcure widow with a jointure of 500<hi>l. per annum</hi> by which he
is—<hi>Ruined.</hi>—Another, a man of fortune, fell in love with,
and married a genteel girl without a farthing; and though ſhe makes him an
excellent wife, he is univerſally allowed to have—<hi>Ruined
himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of the ſtrange
ſenſe, in which a friend of mine once heard this word uſed by a girl of
the town. The young creature, being all life and ſpirits, engroſſed all
the converſation to herſelf; and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indeed was the ſubject of all
the converſation: But what moſt ſurpriſed him, was the manner, in which
ſhe uſed this word <hi>Ruined</hi>; which occurred frequently in her
diſcourſe, though never intended by her to convey the meaning gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
affixed to it. It ſerved her ſometimes as an aera to determine the date of
every occurrence—ſhe bought ſuch a gown juſt after ſhe was
<hi>ruined</hi>—the firſt time ſhe ſaw <hi>Garrick</hi> in
<hi>Ranger,</hi> ſhe was in doubt whether it was before or after ſhe was
<hi>ruined.</hi>—Having occaſion to mention a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſhe
burſt into raptures—O he is a dear creature!—He it was that
<hi>ruined</hi> me.—O he is a dear ſoul!—He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to an inn
ten miles from my father's houſe in the country, where he <hi>ruined</hi>
me.—If he had not <hi>ruined</hi> me, I ſhould have been as miſerable
and as moping as my ſiſters. But the dear ſoul was forced to go to ſea,
and I was obliged to come upon the town, three weeks after I was
<hi>ruined</hi>—no, not ſo much as three weeks after I was
<hi>ruined</hi>—yes, it was full three weeks after I was
<hi>ruined.</hi>

                     <p>JACK, hearing that I was in this part of the world, ſent me
a very hearty letter, informing me that he had been <hi>double-japanned</hi>

rejoiced to hear he was ſo comfortably ſettled, and ſet out immediately

ſuch a loud chorus of <hi>No mortals on earth are ſo happy as we,</hi> that
I began to think I had made a miſtake; till obſerving its cloſe
neighbourhood to the church convinced me, that this could be no other than the
Parſonage-Houſe. On my entrance my friend (whom <pb n="633" facs="tcp:1252700302:208"/> I
found in the midſt of a room-full of fox-hunters in boots and bob wigs) got
up to welcome me to —, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing me, gave me the full flavour of his
Stingo by belching in my face, as he did me the honour of ſaluting me. He
then introduced me to his friends, and placing me at the right hand of his own
elbow chair, aſſured them that I was a very <hi>honeſt Cock,</hi> and
loved a chace of five and twenty miles an end as well as any of them: to
preſerve the credit of which character, I immediately complied, with an
injunction (though I muſt confeſs with leſs real rapture than a ſtaunch
foxhunter) to toſs off a pint bumper of Port, with the foot of the fox dipped
and ſqueezed into it to give a zeſt to the liquor.</p>
                     <p>BUT the whole oeconomy of <hi>Jack</hi>'s life is very
different from that of his brethren. Inſtead of having a wife and a
houſe-full of children, (the moſt common family of a country clergyman,) he
is ſingle, unleſs we credit ſome idle whiſpers in the pariſh that he
is married to his houſekeeper. The calm amuſement of piquet, cheſs, and
back-gammon have no charms for <hi>Jack,</hi> who ſees 
<q rend="inline">"his deareſt action in the field,"</q> and
boaſts that he has a brace of as good hunters in his ſtable, as ever leg
was laid over. Hunting and ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the only buſineſs of his life,
foxhounds and pointers lay about in every parlour, and he is himſelf like
<hi>Piſtol,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in boots. The eſtimation in which he holds his
friends is rated according to their excellence as ſportſmen; and to be able
to make a good ſhot or hunt a pack of hounds well, are admirable qualities.
His pariſhioners often earn a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and a cup of ale at his houſe, by
coming to acquaint him, that they have found a hare ſitting, or a fox in
cover. One day, while I was alone with my friend, the ſervant 
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:1252700302:209"/> came in to tell him that the Clerk wanted to ſpeak
with him. He was ordered in; but I could not help ſmiling when (inſtead of
giving notice of a burying, chriſtening, or ſome other church buſineſs,
as I expected) I found the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt clerk only come to acquaint his reverend
ſuperior, that there was a covey of partridges, of a dozen brace at leaſt,
not above three fields from the houſe.</p>
                     <p>JACK's elder brother Sir <hi>Thomas Quickſet,</hi> who
preſented him with the benefice he now enjoys, is lord of the manor: ſo
that <hi>Jack</hi> has full power to beat up the game unmoleſted. He goes out
three times a week with his brother's hounds, whether Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hunts
or not; and has beſides a deputation from him as lord of the manor,
conſigning the game to his care, and empowering him to take away all guns,
nets, and dogs from perſons not duly qualified. <hi>Jack</hi> is more proud
of this office than many other country clergymen are of being in the
commiſſion for the peace. Poaching is in his eye the moſt heinous crime
in the two tables; nor does the cure of ſouls appear to him half ſo
important a duty as the preſervation of the Game.</p>
                     <p>SUNDAY, you may ſuppoſe, is as dull and tedious to this
ordained ſportſman, as to any fine lady in town: not that he makes the
duties of his function any fatigue to him but as this day is neceſſarily a
day of reſt from the uſual toils of the chaſe. It happened, that the
firſt Sunday after I was with him he had engaged to take care of a Church, in
the abſence of a neighbouring clergyman, which was about twenty miles off. I
engaged to accompany him: and the more to encourage me, he had aſſured me,
that we ſhould ride over as fine a champaign open country as any in the 
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:1252700302:210"/> 
                        <hi>North.</hi> Accordingly I was rouzed by him in the
morning before day-break by a loud hollowing of <hi>hark to Merriman,</hi> and
the repeated ſmacks of his half-hunter; and after we had fortified our
ſtomachs with ſeveral ſlices of hung beef and a horn or two of ſtingo,
we ſallied forth. <hi>Jack</hi> was mounted upon a hunter, which he
aſſured me was never yet <hi>thrown out</hi>: and as we rode along, he
could not help lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo fine a <hi>ſoft</hi> morning ſhould be
thrown away upon a Sunday; at the ſame time remarking, that the dogs might
run breaſt high.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH we made the beſt of our way over hedge and ditch, and
<hi>took</hi> every thing, we were often delayed by trying if we could prick a
hare; or by leaving the road to examine a piece of cover; and he frequently
made me ſtop, not to look at the proſpect, but while he pointed out the
particular courſe that <hi>Reynard</hi> took, or the ſpot where he had
<hi>earth'd.</hi> At length we arrived on full gallop at the Church, where we
found the congregation waiting for us: but as <hi>Jack</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do
but to alight, pull his band out of the ſermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, give his brown
ſcratch bob a ſhake, and clap on the ſurplice, he was preſently
equipped for the ſervice. In ſhort he behaved himſelf both in the deſk
and pulpit to the entire ſatisfaction of all the pariſh as well as the
ſquire of it, who after thanking <hi>Jack</hi> for his excellent
diſcourſe, very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially took us home to dinner with him.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL not trouble you with an account of our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
at the ſquire's, who being himſelf as keen a ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as ever
followed a pack of dogs, was hugely delighted with <hi>Jack</hi>'s
converſation. <hi>Church and King,</hi> and another particular toaſt, were
(in compliment I ſuppoſe to my friend's <pb n="636" facs="tcp:1252700302:211"/> clerical
character) the firſt drank after dinner; but theſe were directly followed
by a pint bumper to <hi>Horſes ſound, Dogs hearty. Earth ſtopt, and Foxes
plenty.</hi> When we had run over again, with great joy and vociferation, as
many chaces as the time would permit, the bell called us to even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers:
after which, (though the ſquire would fain have had us ſtay and take an
hunt with him) we mounted our horſes at the church-door, and rode home in the
dark; becauſe <hi>Jack</hi> had engaged to meet ſeveral of his
brother-ſportſmen, who were to lie all night at his own houſe, to be in
readineſs to make up for the loſs of Sunday, by going out a cock-ſhooting
very early the next morning.</p>
                     <p>I MUST leave it to you, Couſin, to make what reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you pleaſe on this character; only obſerving, that the country can
furniſh many inſtances of theſe ordained ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe thoughts
are more taken up with the ſtable or the dog-kennel than the church: and
indeed, it will be found that our friend <hi>Jack</hi> and all of his ſtamp
are regarded by their pariſhioners, not as Parſons of the Pariſh, but
rather as Squires in Orders.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is with the utmoſt pleaſure that I have obſerved an
article in the news-papers, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that the magiſtrates of this city
will oblige all taverns, ale-houſes, &amp;c. to be ſhut up to-morrow, which
is appointed to be ſet apart as a day of ſolemn faſt and humiliation, on
account of thoſe dreadful Earthquakes from which we have been ſo
providentially preſerved. Without ſuch a reſtriction it is to be feared,
that too many of the vulgar will obſerve this day in the ſame manner as
they are wont to obſerve the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <pb n="638" facs="tcp:1252700302:213"/> Sundays; which
they have been long accuſtomed to look upon as dedicated to Idleneſs and
Intemperance; to which deities they very devoutly pour their libations
(accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own phraſe) in a <hi>church with a chimney in
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT if the common herd are to be thus compelled to their duty,
perſons of faſhion, who are above the law, will I doubt pay as little
regard to this nominal faſt-day, as to <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,
Good-Friday,</hi> or the long-exploded 30th of <hi>January.</hi> Nor can we
expect, that it will work any greater reformation of manners in them, than the
abſurd panic oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned formerly by the ridiculous predictions of a
<hi>Swiſs</hi> madman. Therefore, as they are not to be frightened into a
ſenſe of virtue and religion, we ſhould rather try to wean them gradually
from their darling vices; which may be kept under by ſoftening methods,
though we cannot hope wholly to eradicate them. For this purpoſe, the firſt
ſtep to be previouſly taken, as it appears to me, ſhould be to decoy
people of quality into coming to church, by making it as faſhionable to be
ſeen there, as it was ſome time ago to meet at <hi>Ranelagh</hi> on a
Sunday. They muſt, therefore, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to curteſy, bow, nod, ſmile,
ogle, whiſper, or even bawl to one another, before the ſervice is begun;
and that churches may reſemble other public places of diverſion, ladies and
gentlemen may be permitted to ſend their ſervants to keep places in the
pews: but it ſhall on no conſideration be lawful for them (as is their
cuſtom at the opera or play-houſe) to diſturb the congregation by
dropping in while the prayers are reading or to, interrupt the parſon by
talking loud in the middle of the ſermon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="639" facs="tcp:1252700302:214"/>THIS point being once gained, it might be
poſſible to bring about ſome other reformations in the polite
amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Perhaps to baniſh all ſuch moral plays as the
<hi>Chances</hi> for ever from our theatres, would be in effect to ſhut them
up, or condemn them to empty boxes: the polite world may, therefore, be
ſometimes indulged with them <hi>at the particular deſire of ſeveral
perſons of quality</hi>; or for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſome hoſpital, when their
appearance may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to a motive of charity. Nor would I be ſo
ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as to aboliſh Maſquerades entirely; though I would have them
put under new regulations: and no lady ſhould be ſuffered to go there
half-naked under the pretence of being better diſguiſed; nor ſhould any
one be allowed to perſonate <hi>Eve,</hi> though with a fig-leaf. As to the
darling amuſement of Gaming, I fear it would be a vain attempt to think of
reſtraining it within any bounds at preſent: nor is it poſſible to
expell the card-table from the routes of perſons of faſhion, even upon a
Sunday. I would therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſince they muſt play, the
winnings on that day ſhould be given to the poor of the pariſh; and that
they ſhould uſe a particular ſort of cards (like thoſe contrived for
the amuſement and inſtruction of children) ſtrewed with texts of
ſcripture and other religious and moral ſentences.</p>
               <p>GALLANTRY and intrigue may be likewiſe reckoned among the
faſhionable amuſements of the preſent age: and I confeſs I am at a
loſs to know under what reſtrictions to confine them. Married people may
perhaps be allowed to indulge themſelves in any freedoms, by the mutual
conſent of each party; provided always, that they are perſons of
diſtinction, and that the match between them was made merely on account of
family or fortune, in conformity to <pb n="640" facs="tcp:1252700302:215"/> the true ſenſe
and ſpirit of the late Marriage Act. With reſpect to thoſe, who take a
pleaſure in debauching raw country girls and common tradeſmens daughters, I
had once a thought, that a clauſe ſhould be added to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Act, to oblige the offenders to do penance in a white ſheet; but I have
ſince conſidered, that our modern bucks and bloods would probably take as
much pride in this badge of honour, as a young officer in his ſcarf and
cockade. As to the genteel practice of keeping miſtreſſes, no one
ſhould be allowed to take a girl into keeping, but thoſe who are already
paſt their grand climacteric, and may be ſuppoſed to want a nurſe:
except it ſhould be thought expedient to extend this privilege to thoſe
ſpirited young fellows, who at the age of five and twenty have worn down
their conſtitutions to threeſcore.</p>
               <p>WE cannot but admire the extreme courage and ſenſe of
honour, which characteriſes our modern heroes, and inſpires them
ſometimes with a deſire of killing their friends, and ſometimes of
killing themſelves. But as this noble ſpirit ſhould be only exerted
againſt the common enemy, the honour of the Duelliſt might be ſatisfied,
I ſhould think, by a mock-combat without bloodſhed; and the courage of the
Suicide might be confined to a bare <hi>attempt</hi> on his own life, without
the loſs of it. Duels, therefore, ſhould be fought with guarded ſoils, as
in tragedy-rencounters; and any gentleman (or even mechanic) who finds an
inclination to make away with himſelf, may be allowed to try the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
by drawing a knife or razor acroſs his throat ſo as not to cut the
wind-pipe, or by running a ſword through the ſkin without piercing the
ribs; or he may flaſh a piſtol in his face charged with powder only, or be
tucked up in his <pb n="641" facs="tcp:1252700302:216"/> own garters with a wad of cotton about
his neck, and his neareſt relation ſtanding by, ready to cut him down (if
he pleaſes) before he be quite dead.</p>
               <p>I am prevented from perſuing this ſubject any farther, in
order to make room for the following letter.</p>

                     <p>AS the day appointed, for a General Faſt in theſe
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms is now at hand, I ſhall beg leave to touch upon ſome laxities in
the uſual manner of obſerving a Faſt; which though they are not of
ſufficient dignity to be taken notice of from the pulpit, ſhould yet be
pointed out, as the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Faſt in theſe particulars is almoſt
univerſal.</p>
                     <p>THE very name of a Faſt implies a day of abſtinence, of
mortification and ſelf-denial; which has always been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined as a
neceſſary means of ſubduing irregular deſires, and fitting us for holy
meditations. For this reaſon, in former days, when people of quality roſe
earlier than even mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics now open their ſhops, when the Court itſelf
dined at eleven, that meal was deferred till four o'clock in compliance with
this religious exerciſe, which was in thoſe times a real abſtinence, a
true piece of mortification and ſelf-denial. But if the obſervance of a
Faſt conſiſts in not dining till four o'clock, our perſons of faſhion
may be ſaid to faſt every day of their lives. In truth, the ſeveral hours
of the day are adapted to ſuch very different employments to what they were
formerly, that our four o'clock ſtands in the place of their eleven: and
nothing can be more abſurd (to uſe no harſher term) than to adhere to the
form in the performance of a religious act, when by the alteration of
circumſtances, <pb n="642" facs="tcp:1252700302:217"/> that form flatly contradicts the very
meaning of its original inſtitution. I would alſo aſk thoſe rigid
devotees, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this day in all the ſtrictneſs of the letter, and
would be ſhocked at ſight of a leg of mutton or beef-ſteak on their
tables, whether the dining upon ſalt or other fiſh, may not be conſidered
rather as feaſting than faſting, if (as is often the caſe) it ſhould
happen to be a diſh they are remarkably fond of. All theſe methods of
keeping a Faſt without abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, mortification, or ſelf-denial, are
mere quibbles to evade the performance of our duty, and entirely fruſtrate
the deſign of appointing this ſolemnity. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this
nature very commonly practiſed in <hi>France:</hi> where there are many
families who keep the whole Lent with great ſtrictneſs; but the laſt
night of it invite a great deal of company to ſupper. The moment the clock
ſtrikes twelve, a magnificent entertainment, conſiſting of all ſorts of
rich fare, is ſerved up, and theſe moſt Chriſtian debauchees ſit down
to indulge in luxury, without ſinning againſt the Canon.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE juſt now, with near an hundred more, taken the
firſt degree, which this Univerſity confers on her ſons; and begin to
conſider within myſelf, in what manner we have ſpent our time for theſe
four years paſt, and what profit we are likely to receive hereafter from
theſe our academical ſtudies: But upon retroſpection I find that
inſtead of having laid up a ſtore of learning, which might have been of
ſervice to us in our future connections and intercourſe with mankind, we
have been confounding our heads with a miſcellaneous heap of nonſenſe,
which moſt of us, I am certain, are endeavouring to unlearn as 
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:1252700302:219"/> faſt as poſſible we can: inſtead of having
acquired ſuch a ſhare of common ſenſe, as might have been of ſervice
to ourſelves and acquaintance, we muſt entirely ſell off our old ſtock,
and begin the world of literature anew. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection cannot be very
pleaſing to thoſe, who I muſt ſay have ſquandered away ſo very
precious a time of life; a time of life, when, though judgment perhaps is not
come to maturity, yet imagination and invention, thoſe noble off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings of
a promiſing mind, are in the very flower and bloom of perfection.</p>
                     <p>THIS ſeat of learning (for it undoubtedly deſerves that
name) has drawn and kept us together for ſome years; our manners,
converſation, and ſtudies bear a great ſimilitude: but now either chance
or choice is going to diſperſe us over the whole kingdom; and our places of
abode will ſcarcely be more widely different, than our ſchemes of life.
Notwithſtanding this, the ſame plan of ſtudy has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on all:
Whether agreeable, or contrary to the bent of inclination, has never been
regarded. Mathematics is the ſtandard, to which all merit is referred; and
all the excellencies, without theſe, are quite overlooked and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: the
ſolid learning of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> is a trifling
acquiſition; and much more ſo, every polite accompliſhment: in ſhort,
if you will not get all <hi>Euclid</hi> and his diagrams by heart, and pore
over <hi>Saunderſon</hi> 'till you are as blind as he was himſelf, they
will ſay of you, as in the motto to one of your late papers, <hi>actum eſt,
ilicet, periſti.</hi> Not that I would depreciate this kind of learning; it
is certainly a moſt noble ſcience, and reflects the greateſt honour on
human wit and invention: all that I complain of, is the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſtreſs that is laid upon it; nay even the more abſtruſe 
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:1252700302:220"/> parts of it: which is ſtill more abſurd, as there
are ſo very few heads able to perceive and retain the nice chain of
reaſoning and deduction, which muſt neceſſarily be made uſe of, and
as a ſmall number of mathematical geniuſſes would be ſufficient for the
ſervice of his Majeſty's dominions.</p>
                     <p>I TAKE it for granted, that your ſagacity has by this time
diſcovered, that you have been addreſſed by a young man, whoſe
too-overweening conceit of himſelf has, perhaps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to imagine,
that the Univerſity has not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently rewarded his deſerts. If ſo,
you are not deceived: but though this diſappointment may at preſent ſet a
little uneaſy upon me, yet I think I can foreſee, that it will be the
moſt fortunate mortification that could poſſibly have befallen me. For,
in the firſt place, it has ſufficiently abated that upſtart pride, which
moſt young men are apt to take in their own abilities; than which nothing can
be more inſufferable to all their acquaintance, or a greater impediment to
their own real improvement. A pert ſcholar, whenever he enters a room of
company, immediately aſſumes a ſuperiority in diſcourſe, and thinks
himſelf obliged to correct all impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties in thought or expreſſion.
You muſt 
<q rend="inline">"ſpeak by the card,"</q> as <hi>Hamlet</hi>
ſays, or expect the cenſure of this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial coxcomb. If, according
to the common form of ſpeech, you ſay that there is either heat in fire, or
coldneſs in ice, he will inform you, that you deliver yourſelf very
inaccurately, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has fully demonſtrated; he will tell you,
you cannot prove, that two and two make four, or that you are alive yourſelf.
Theſe, and a thouſand other equally impertinent obſervations, he is

ladies, and honeſt country gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="646" facs="tcp:1252700302:221"/>WHAT is ſtill a greater misfortune, is
that a man of this caſt is never likely to know any better: for having raked
together a few metaphyſical diſtinctions and ſcholaſtic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements,
he thinks, he has laid up a ſufficient fund of knowledge for his whole life:
he deſpiſes all common ſenſe (which is the beſt ſenſe) through an
ambition of appearing particular; and as for the advice or opinion of others,
thoſe he thinks himſelf indiſpenſably bound to diſregard; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ſuch ſubmiſſion implies ſome inferiority, which he would by no
means be thought to labour under. Such a diſpoſition as this, I take to be
the ſure and infallible token of confirmed ignorance: a melancholy inſtance
of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of human nature, that the leſs we know, the more we
preſume; and the fewer advances we have made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards true knowledge, the
leſs occaſion we think we have of any further improvement.</p>
                     <p>IN the ſecond place, if I may be allowed to judge of what I
cannot poſſibly have experienced, I take it to be the greateſt benefit to
a young perſon to meet with early diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in life: for ſooner or
later every one muſt have his ſhare of them; and the ſooner we meet with
ſome of them, the better: for by this means the mind is eaſily made
familiar with croſſes and vexations, and is not thrown off its balance by
every thwarting and wayward accident. By this means, we ſubmit to ills and
troubles, as the neceſſary attendants on mankind; juſt as on a rainy day
we make ourſelves quiet and contented, but hope for ſunſhine on the
morrow. And, indeed, there ſeems to be a ſtrong analogy between the
inclemency of the weather attacking our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the ſtorms of
afflictions which batter our minds. <pb n="647" facs="tcp:1252700302:222"/> The rain will beat,
and the wind will roar, let us uſe our utmoſt endeavours to the contrary;
but by enuring our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the viciſſitudes of the ſeaſons, and
uſing other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per methods, we ſhall feel no very ſenſible
inconvenience from them: In like manner all our ſkill and art cannot prevent
or elude the rubs and diſaſters to which we are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but if by degrees,
and early in life, we are hardened and accuſtomed to them, and if by the help
of reaſon and ſound philoſophy we arm and fortify ourſelves againſt
them, they may ſtill perhaps reach us; but their ſhocks will be quite weak
and languid, and we may ſay of Fortune, as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſays of
<hi>Priam</hi> when he hurled a javelin at <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>

                     <p>I Am ſo great an admirer of the fair ſex, that I never let
a tittle of their vendible writings eſcape me. I bought this year the
<hi>Lady</hi>'s <hi>Diary,</hi> merely becauſe it was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed as the
<hi>Woman</hi>'s <hi>Almanack,</hi> which I conſtrued, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack
compoſed by a Woman: but I find I have been miſtaken in my ſuppoſition.
It is not the work of a female. The Chriſtian name of the author, I have
reaſon to believe, is <hi>Marmaduke</hi>; unleſs I miſunderſtand a
moſt curious copy of verſes, deſcribing a moſt ſuperb entertainment,
of fiſh, fleſh, pies, and tarts, exhibited upon New Year's Day 1755. His
Sirname remains as great an Aenigma as any in his book. His coadjutors,

<hi>Nancy Evelyn,</hi> Miſs <hi>E. S.</hi> Miſs <hi>Atkinſon, Enira,</hi>
and other choice little feminine ſpirits of the age. Riddles are ſo
becoming, and appear ſo pretty, when dandled about by ladies, that they may
be compared to ſoft, ſmooth, painted waxen babbies, dreſſed up in a

                     <p>YOU muſt know, Sir, in my younger days I was very
ſuſceptible of the paſſion of love: my heart was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fluttering,
jumping, and ſkipping, when a female object was in view: and being a pretty
good maſter of that <pb n="650" facs="tcp:1252700302:225"/> kind of romantic nonſenſe,
with which the fair are too often captivated; being fond of dancing,
friſking, capering, and fidgeting to all public places; I gained the
affections of many, but could ſettle to none: and my heart conſtantly
returned to its owner with the wound healed.</p>
                     <p>IN this manner I lived till I grew paſt forty; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch kind of life not ſo agreeable, but rather fatiguing, I came to a
reſolution to marry, and ſettle quietly in the world the remainder of my
days. You may gueſs from my general acquaintance, I could not be a great
while before I had an opportunity offered of meeting ſomething ſuitable to
my inclinations: accordingly I fixed my mind on a widow lady about ten years
younger than myſelf; to whom I made known my intentions as ſoon as I could.
I was received in ſuch a manner as all happy lovers would wiſh to be: and
at laſt got her promiſe for the completion: but when I preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the
day, was told it could not be ſo ſoon as I deſired; for to ſurrender on
ſo ſhort a courtſhip, the world might impute as an indecorum in her
character.</p>
                     <p>I MUST tell you, I ſoon found (like <hi>Malvolio</hi> in the
play) that ſhe had a great paſſion for white ſilk ſtockings; and you
may be ſure I always dreſſed my legs in that colour: but as ill luck
would have it, ſome little time ſince, having ſtayed with her pretty
late, and not being able to get either coach or chair, I was forced to trudge
home in the rain, my curſed white ſtockings were wet from top to bottom;
the next morning the rheumatiſm took poſſeſſion of one of my knees,
which not only cauſed an hobble in my gait, but obliged me to cloath my legs
with thick ribb'd worſted for the ſake of warmth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="651" facs="tcp:1252700302:226"/>THUS hobbling and cloathed, I went to
viſit my charmer, who as I entered the room was ſitting in her chair more
grave than uſual; which I imputed to her attention to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic affairs,
and ſat down by her. I took hold of her hand, and was going to intrude on her
lips for a kiſs—But would you think it, Mr. TOWN! inſtead of
ſuffering my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, ſhe reclined her head on the chair; drew her hand
from mine; held it up as a bar between us; aroſe; and told me I muſt take
no ſuch liberties in future. I expoſtulated; and was for attempting again,
imagining it was only a whim, (for you well know they all have their whims) but
to my great misfortune found it was real. She reſumed her place; and in a
grave manner told me, I muſt think no more of what had paſſed between us;
that ſhe ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have a regard for me, but was determined not to
marry; and therefore expected I ſhould from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all further
pretenſion. I earneſtly (as you can make no doubt) preſſed for
reaſons, but could get none except broken hints; ſuch as—I would not
have you marry—It may hurt your conſtitution, which ſeems to be very
delicate—I cannot turn Nurſe—We ſhall not anſwer each others
expectations—and without any further or other ceremony, ſhe quitted the
room with all the haughty airs of a fine lady, who knows ſhe has the man
totally in her power.</p>
                     <p>OH Mr. TOWN! imagine what a confuſed ſituation I was in: I
was thunder-ſtruck: I was over-whelmed with horror and aſtoniſhment: I
ſtood like the Soldier when he beheld the ſhocking condition of his General
<hi>Belliſarius.</hi> After being a long time in that condition, I a little
recovered my ſenſes; and with much difficulty prevailed on her maid, to 
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:1252700302:227"/> follow her to her retreat; and to beg the favour only to
ſpeak to her. That was denied me; I was told her determination was fixed;
ſhe expected I would obey it; and that ſhe ſhould be abſent when I came
again.</p>
                     <p>I AM at preſent uncertain what to do: I ſhall therefore be
obliged to you, if you will adviſe me, (as I can prove a promiſe of
marriage) whether I ſhall put the affair into the hands of my attorney: or
whether I ſhall ſtay till the warm weather comes (which I imagine will
carry off my rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm) and attack her again: or whether I ſhall pocket
the diſappointment, and think no more of matrimony. Give me ſome
conſolation if you can: but if you have none, I deſire, for the good of
young batchelors like myſelf, you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them all between forty and
fifty not to wear white ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in winter.</p>

                     <p>AS there are ſome vices, which the vulgar have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to copy from the great, ſo there are others, which the great have
condeſcended to borrow from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Among theſe I cannot but ſet
down the black-guard practice (for ſo I muſt call it) of Curſing and
Swearing: a practice, which (to ſay nothing at preſent of its
profaneneſs) is low and indelicate, and places a man of quality on the ſame
level with the chairman at his door. For my own part I cannot ſee the
difference between a <hi>By Gad</hi> or a <hi>Dem-me</hi> minced and ſoftened
by a gentle pronunciation from well-bred lips, and the ſame expreſſion
bluntly bolted out from the broad mouth of a carman or an oyſter-wench.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="653" facs="tcp:1252700302:228"/>YOUR predeceſſor the SPECTATOR has
given us an account of a ſelect party of Swearers, who were extremely
ſurpriſed at their own common talk, which was taken down in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and afterwards repeated to them. In like manner, if we were to draw out a
catalogue of faſhionable Oaths and Curſes in preſent uſe at
<hi>Arthur</hi>'s or any other polite aſſembly, would not the company
themſelves be led to imagine, that the converſation had been carried on
between the loweſt of the mob? Would they not bluſh to find, that they had
gleaned their choiceſt phraſes from ſtreets and allies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
their diſcourſe by the elegant dialect of <hi>Wapping</hi> or <hi>Broad
Saint Giles</hi>'s?</p>
                     <p>I SHALL purpoſely wave making any reflections on the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of this practice, as I am ſatisfied they would have but little
weight either with the <hi>beau-monde</hi> or the <hi>canaille.</hi> The
Swearer of either ſtation devotes himſelf piece-meal (as it were) to
deſtruction; pours out anathemas againſt his eyes, his heart, his ſoul,
and every part of his body; and extends the ſame good wiſhes to the limbs
and joints of his friends and acquaintance. This they both do with the ſame
fearleſs unconcern; but with this difference only, that the
Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Swearer damns himſelf and others with the greateſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and
good-breeding imaginable.</p>
                     <p>I KNOW it will be pleaded in excuſe for this practice, that
Oaths and Curſes are intended only as mere expletives, to fill up and give a
grace to converſation: but as there are ſtill ſome old-faſhioned
creatures, who adhere to their common acceptation, it would be proper to
ſubſtitute ſome other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning terms in their room, and at the ſame
time remote from the vulgar Curſing and Swearing. A worthy clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man 
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:1252700302:229"/> (whoſe name I cannot recollect) being chaplain of a
regiment, is ſaid to have reclaimed the officers, who were much addicted to
the vulgar idiom of ſwearing, by taking occaſion to tell them a ſtory, in
which he introduced the words <hi>bottle and glaſs,</hi> inſtead of the
uſual expletives of <hi>God, Devil,</hi> and <hi>damn,</hi> which he did not
think quite ſo becoming for one of <hi>his cloth</hi> to make free with. The
ſame method might, I imagine, be followed by our people of faſhion,
whenever they are obliged to have recourſe to the like ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for
thought. <hi>Bottle and glaſs</hi> might be uſed with great energy in the
table-talk at the <hi>King's Arms</hi> or <hi>Saint Alban's</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns: the
gameſter might be indulged in ſwearing by the <hi>Knave of Clubs,</hi> or
the <hi>Curſe of Scotland;</hi> or he might with ſome propriety retain the
old execration of <hi>the Deuce take it:</hi> the beau ſhould be allowed to 
<q rend="inline">"ſwear by his gracious ſelf, which is the
god of his idolatry;"</q> and the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletives of converſation ſhould
conſiſt only of <hi>upon my word,</hi> or <hi>upon my honour</hi>; which,
whatever ſenſe they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bear, are at preſent underſtood
only as words of courſe without meaning.</p>

any extraordinary panic which has once ſeized it: for this reaſon we
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſurpriſed, that many well-meaning people, who have not yet
ſhook off the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions occaſioned by the late dreadful earthquakes,
ſhould be led to conjure up new terrors, and alarm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with
imaginary dangers. Their fears interpret every common incident, and even the
change of weather, as ſigns of approaching deſtruction: if the day be calm
and ſerene, ſuch (they ſay) is the uſual fore-runner of a ſhock; or
if the <pb n="656" facs="tcp:1252700302:231"/> night prove tempeſtuous, they can hardly
perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that it is only the wind which rocks their houſes.
With this propenſity to entertain any unreaſonable dread about future
events, it is no wonder, that weak minds ſhould be further worked upon by
little dablers in philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; who having gleaned a few barren ſcraps from
the Magazines, preſume even to foretell the diſſolution of the world by
the Comet which will appear in 1758. <hi>Swift,</hi> in his <hi>Voyage to
Laputa,</hi> has a paſſage ſo very appoſite to theſe idle pretenders
to ſcience, that I ſhall beg leave to tranſcribe it.</p>
               <q> 
                  <p> THESE people (ſays he) are under continual diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudes,
never enjoying a minute's peace of mind; and their diſturbances proceed from
cauſes, which very little affect the reſt of mortals. Their apprehenſions
ariſe from ſeveral changes they dread in the celeſtial bodies. For
inſtance, that the earth by the continual approaches of the ſun towards it
muſt in courſe of time be abſorbed, or ſwallowed up. That the face of
the ſun will by degrees be encruſted with its own effluvia, and give no
more light to the world. That the earth very narrowly eſcaped a bruſh from
the laſt comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to aſhes; and that
the next, which they have calculated for one and thirty years hence, will
probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us. For, if in its perihelion it ſhould approach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a certain degree of the ſun (as by their calculations they have reaſons to
dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thouſand times more intenſe,
than that of red hot glowing iron; and, in its abſence from the ſun carry a
blazing tail ten hundred thouſand and fourteen miles long; through which if
the earth ſhould paſs at the diſtance of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand miles
from the <hi>nucleus,</hi> or main body of <pb n="657" facs="tcp:1252700302:232"/> the comet, it
muſt in its paſſage be ſet on fire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to aſhes. That the
ſun, daily ſpending its rays without any nutriment to ſupply them, will
at laſt be wholly conſumed and annihilated; which muſt be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
the deſtruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light
from it.</p> 
                  <p> THEY are ſo perpetually alarmed with the apprehenſions of
theſe, and the like impending dangers, that they can neither ſleep quietly
in their beds, nor have any reliſh for the common pleaſures or amuſements
of life. When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the firſt queſtion
is about the ſun's health, how he looked at his ſetting and riſing, and
what hopes they have to avoid the ſtroke of an approaching comet. This
converſation they are apt to run into with the ſame temper, that boys
diſcover to hear terrible ſtories of ſpirits and hobgoblins, which they
greedily liſten to, and dare not go to bed for fear.</p>
               </q>
               <p>LET us therefore baniſh from our thoughts all ſuch vain
notions, and let us fortify our minds with a true ſenſe of religion, which
will teach us to rely on the protection of that providence, which has hitherto
preſerved us. It is with great pleaſure, that I remarked the unanimous
concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all ranks of people, in obſerving the late ſolemn Faſt,
as a neceſſary act of humiliation, to avert the wrath and vengeance of
heaven, and to call down its mercies upon us: nor do I doubt, but the
approaching Seaſon will awaken in us the ſame ſerious attention to our
duty; that we may not ſeem to have barely complied with a ſtated form, or
to have been affected with the ſhort-lived piety of a ſingle day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:1252700302:233"/>IT is true, indeed, that no perſons do
more prejudice to the cauſe of religion, than they who cloud its genuine
chearfulneſs with the gloom of ſuperſtition, and are apt to conſider
every common accident that befalls us, as a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They cloath religion in
the moſt terrifying habit, and (as it were, dreſs it up in all the horrors
of the Inquiſition. Theſe people are much to be pitied; and it is to be
wiſhed, that their miſtaken piety could be better regulated. But there is
another ſet of men of a different turn, more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and much more
dangerous to the community, who treat every act of religion as a jeſt, and
hold its moſt ſacred ordinances in contempt. Set forms and ceremonies,
though they have no eſſential virtue in themſelves, are yet
indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably requiſite to keep alive in us a quick ſenſe of our
duty. It muſt be allowed, indeed, that if a man could conſtantly employ his
mind in holy meditations, exerciſe the virtues, and believe the myſteries
of our religion, he would be a true Chriſtian, though he never complied with
any outward forms, or ſo much as repeated a ſingle prayer. But it is
manifeſt from experience, that thoſe who neglect the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, neglect
alſo the duties of a Chriſtian; and the leaſt reflection on the human
mind will convince us, that ſome external rites are neceſſary to ſettle
the wandering ideas, and to fix the attention on its proper object. The fervent
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of a prayer is apt to inſpire us with love and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards
the DEITY, and kindles the ſparks of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within us: and it is eaſy to
conceive, that if the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of public worſhip was neglected among us
only for one year, it would be a more fatal blow to religion than all the weak
attacks of infidels and free-thinkers. No argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore, could be more
ill-grounded than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections <pb n="659" facs="tcp:1252700302:234"/> of thoſe people, who
conſidered the appointment of the late ſolemn faſt as uſeleſs and
unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>BUT though forms may be ſaid to compoſe the body, a good
life is the ſoul of religion, without which the reſt is but a dead maſs.
The moſt rigid compliance with every ordinance of the Church, if it has no
influence on our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, is rather a ſolemn mockery than an attonement for
our offences: as they, who receive the bread and wine without a firm
reſolution to lead a new life, are ſaid to eat and drink their own
damnation: Wherefore, a ſtrict obſervance of this or that particular day is
not a ſufficient diſcharge of our duty, except it ſerve to rouze us from
the lethargy of ſin, to awaken in us a deſire of becoming worthy the
protection of the ALMIGHTY, by animating our faith, amending our lives, and
working in us a repentance of our tranſgreſſions. Thus the Lord's Day is
not merely ſet apart for devotion, with an unlimited licence to wickedneſs
all the reſt of the week; but our being particularly exerciſed in acts of
piety for one day, is calculated to ſtrengthen our virtue, and to give a
tincture of religion to our whole conduct through the other ſix.</p>
               <p>THESE conſiderations I have thought fit to lay before the
reader, as preparatory to another ſolemn Faſt ordained by the Church: and
if the obſervance of this ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or ſlightly paſſed
over, may we not conclude, that our ſenſe of religion is only in proportion
to our ſenſe of danger? As for thoſe, who require conſtantly to be
fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened into their duty, I will for once venture to commence prophet: and
let them be aſſured that my predictions will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly come to paſs.
There is a danger, more certain than an <pb n="660" facs="tcp:1252700302:235"/> Earthquake or a
Comet, which will inevitably overwhelm us; from which we cannot poſſibly
guard ourſelves, and which perhaps is even now at our doors. This danger I
cannot better ſet forth, than in the alarming words of a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<hi>French</hi> preacher. 
<q rend="inline">"I know a man (and I will point him out
preſently) who is now in this church; a man, in perfect health; a man, in the
flower of his age: And yet this man, perhaps before next Sunday, perhaps by
to-morrow, will be in his grave. This man, my dear brethren, is Myſelf who
ſpeak to you, it is You who hear me."</q>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VERY <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who has the good of his country
at heart, muſt lament the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity which our miniſters labour under, in
contriving ways and means to raiſe money for the preſent exigence of
affairs. I have with pleaſure hearkened to the ſeveral projects propoſed
in the debates of patriots in our coffee-houſes and private clubs: but though
I find they are unanimous in allowing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of levying new taxes,
every one is willing to ſhift off the burthen from himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="662" facs="tcp:1252700302:237"/>I WAS introduced the other night into a
ſet of worthy citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who very zealouſly took this ſubject into
conſideration over their evening pipe. One of them a grave gentleman, pulling
the <hi>Evening Poſt</hi> out of his pocket, and putting on his ſpectacles,
read aloud to us the ſeveral methods already propoſed; to which many wiſe
objections were immediately ſtarted by the company. 
<q rend="inline">"What's that? ſays an old don, (who I
afterwards found had a ſmall eſtate in houſes) An additional duty upon
bricks, and pan-tiles, and plain-tiles, I ſuppoſe they will lay a tax upon
plain-tile-pegs by and bye?"</q> This ſpeech was received with an hearty
chuckle of applauſe from the reſt of the company; when another took
occaſion to obſerve, 
<q rend="inline">"that he very much approved the ſcheme for
laying a larger tax upon cards and dice; one of which he called the <hi>devil's
books,</hi> and the other his <hi>bones.</hi>"</q> The duty upon plate might
perhaps have paſſed into a law in this aſſembly, if it had not been
vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppoſed by one member, (whom I diſcovered to be a
ſilver-ſmith,) in which he was ſeconded by the landlord of the houſe,
who had a ſeat in this meeting, and told us, 
<q rend="inline">"that it would lye very hard upon publicans,
as nobody would now drink their porter out of a pewter-pot."</q> Theſe and
the like arguments induced us to ſet aſide all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that had been
offered hitherto and to conſult together in order to find new ones in their
room; among which I could not but ſmile at the propoſal of an honeſt
peruke-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who adviſed the levying of a poll-tax upon all that wore their
own hair, 
<q rend="inline">"For, ſays he, we have never had good times,
ſince wigs were out of faſhion. What rare days were thoſe in Queen
<hi>Anne</hi>'s reign, when the nobility and gentry wore large flaxen flows of
thirty guineas price! And <pb n="663" facs="tcp:1252700302:238"/> as you may ſee in my lord
<hi>Godolphin</hi>'s monument in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Abby, a prime
miniſter's wig, could not be made, I am ſure, under fifty guineas."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE diſcourſe that paſſed at this ſociety of
politicians has led me to turn my thoughts on deviſing ſome method, that
might anſwer the preſent demands for a ſupply, with the leaſt injury to
the community. On this account I am of Opinion that private vices (according to
the favourite tenet of <hi>Maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derville)</hi> may in ſome meaſure be
converted into public benefits, by laying a certain tax or duty on the
faſhionable amuſements of the gay and polite world. For this purpoſe I
have with great pains and labour contrived a plan, a few heads of which,
without further preface, I ſhall (with your leave) ſubmit to the
conſideration of thoſe whom it may concern.</p>
                     <p>FIRST then, I would propoſe, that no perſons of quality,
or others, ſhould be allowed to keep any route, drum, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
viſiting-day, (or whatever other name it may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be called by,) at
which more than one hundred perſons ſhall be found aſſembled, without
paying a certain rate for every ſuch route, drum, &amp;c. The number of
theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are held in this town, (including the city of
<hi>London</hi> and the ſuburbs thereof) I have computed, upon an exact
calculation, to amount annually to eight thouſand three hundred and upwards;
ſo that if a duty, at only ſix-pence <hi>per</hi> head, were to be levied
upon the company, it would bring in a prodigious income to the government;
deducting for the decreaſe conſequent of this tax, as alſo for thoſe
which we may expect will be ſmuggled or carried on clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinely. And as
gaming is an eſſential diverſion at all theſe meetings, I would further
adviſe, that every card-table be <pb n="664" facs="tcp:1252700302:239"/> marked and numbered,
in the ſame manner as waggons and coaches, and a proportionable rate fixed on
them according to the degree and quality of the owners. Be it enacted moreover,
that extraordinary licences ſhall be taken out for playing at cards on the
Sabbath-day; but that theſe be granted only to perſons of the higheſt
rank and faſhion.</p>
                     <p>AT the preſent juncture of affairs every one will agree with
me, that if an abſolute prohibition be impracticable, an heavy duty ſhould
be laid on the importation of <hi>French</hi> faſhions and fopperies into
this kingdom. It is therefore but reaſonable, that all <hi>French</hi> cooks,
valets de chambre, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liners, mantua-makers, hair-cutters, &amp;c. ſhould be
at leaſt doubly taxed, as it is notorious that they exact from the dupes, who
employ them, more than double the wages or price for their labours, that our
own modeſt countrymen would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. This tax I make no doubt, would produce
no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum for the public uſe: and as our ladies, though I
would not ſuſpect that they have <hi>French</hi> hearts, are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of
wearing <hi>French</hi> complexions, a further ſum might alſo be raiſed
by fixing an high duty upon <hi>rouge</hi> and <hi>carmine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I SHALL not dwell on other particulars, which might be turned
in the ſame manner to the public good; ſuch as a tax on kept
miſtreſſes, for example, which practice is now become ſo generally
faſhionable, that I queſtion not but a duty properly levied on them would
be ſufficient to maintain all the widows of our ſoldiers and ſailors, who
ſhall happen to be killed in the ſervice. But as it is incumbent on every
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> to expoſe his life in defence of his country againſt
the common enemy, I muſt particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, that ſome means may be
deviſed, that the gallant <pb n="665" facs="tcp:1252700302:240"/> feats of thoſe men of
honour, who rather chuſe to riſk their lives in the modiſh way of
duelling, may be attended with ſome advantage to their countrymen. I would
therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, that ſwords and piſtols of a ſettled length and
bore, with the Tower-ſtamp, be provided by the government for the uſe of
Duelliſts, and that they ſhall not preſume to make uſe of any other,
under pain of incurring the guilt of murder. Theſe weapons may be let out at
a certain price; and if one of the parties happen to kill the other, the
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor ſhall be ſubject to a fine according to his rank and ſtation,
and a jury ſhall be directed to bring in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>Self-Defence.</hi>
In like manner, perſons of quality may have leave granted them to put an end
to their own lives, after an ill luck at cards, or the like emergent
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; when, upon paying a certain rate, they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in a
private execution from the hands of <hi>Jack Ketch,</hi> and the Coroner's
inqueſt ſhall be directed to bring in their verdict, <hi>Lunacy.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE generality of the young unmarried ladies of the preſent
age diſlike no company ſo much as the elderly perſons of their own ſex,
whether married or unmarried. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an old maiden aunt, a mamma, or
grand-mamma to the play, or to <hi>Ranelagh,</hi> is ſo inſipid an
amuſement, that it robs their entertainment of the very name of a party of
pleaſure. To be handed into a box, walk in the public gardens, or make one at
a card-table at a route, with a ſprightly young nobleman, or gallant colonel
of the guards, has ſome life in it; but to be kept perpetually under the wing
of an old lady, can have no charms for a woman of ſpirit. The preſence of
theſe antiquated females impoſes a conſtraint on their behaviour: they
are, indeed, like the <pb n="668" facs="tcp:1252700302:243"/> 
                  <hi>Duennas</hi> in
<hi>Spain,</hi> ſpies on the conduct of the gay and young; and a good old
gentlewoman with a young beauty by her ſide watches her every motion, and is
as much frighted, if the pretty creature makes any advances to a man, as a hen,
who has been foſter-mother to a brood of duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, is alarmed at their
taking to the water.</p>
               <p>BUT though a looſe coquet behaviour is ſo much in vogue, a
modeſt deportment is moſt natural and becoming in the fair ſex; and I am
always glad to ſee a young lady of ſufficient ſenſe and diſcretion,
to behave with an innocent chearfulneſs, inſtead of apparent uneaſineſs
and conſtraint, before her more aged female friends and relations. But though
a daughter ſhould prefer no company to her mother, a ſon would appear as
ridiculous, if he always dangled at the ſide of his mamma, as if he wore his
ſiſter's petticoats: and however amiable this maidenly demeanor might
ſeem in a young girl, I cannot view it with equal approbation in the
character of a Male-Virgin;—a character, with which I ſhall here
preſent the reader, as drawn by one of my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU have already given us ſeveral inſtances of thoſe
am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous creatures among the men, who are both male and female: permit me to
add to them an account of thoſe lady-like gentlemen, whom we may
diſtinguiſh by the title of <hi>their mother's own ſons</hi>; who have in
vain changed the bib and leading-ſtrings for the breeches, and ſtick as
cloſe to their mammas, as a great calf to the ſide of an old cow. I am
intimately acquainted with one of theſe over-grown ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies; 
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:1252700302:244"/> who is indeed too big to be dandled in lap, or fed with
a pap-ſpoon, though he is no more weaned from his mother, than if he had not
yet quitted the nurſery.</p>
                     <p>THE delicate BILLY SUCKLING is the contempt of the men, the
jeſt of the women, and the darling of his mamma. She doats on him to
diſtraction; and is in perpetual admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his wit, and anxiety for his
health. The good young gentleman, for his part, is neither undutiful nor
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful: ſhe is the only woman, that he does not look on with
indifference; and ſhe is his tutoreſs, his phyſician, and his nurſe.
She provides his broth every evening, will not ſuffer him to look into a book
by candle-light, leſt he ſhould hurt his eyes; and takes care to have his
bed warmed: nay, I have known him ſit with his mamma's white hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief
round his neck through a whole viſit, to guard him from the wind of that
<hi>ugly door,</hi> or that <hi>terrible chink in the wainſcot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT however familiarly he may behave in his addreſſes to
his mother, and whatever little acts of gallantry may paſs between them, no
encouragement can prevail on him to treat other women with the ſame freedom.
Being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired at a ball to dance a minuet, inſtead of taking out any
of the young ladies, he could pitch upon no partner ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to whom he
might offer the compliment of his hand, as his mother; and I remember, when he
was once called upon in a large company at a tavern to give a lady in his turn,
he plainly ſhewed who was the ſole miſtreſs of his affections, by
toaſting his mother. The gallant cuſtom of challenging a lady to drink a
bumper, by leaving it to her option whether ſhe will have <hi>hob</hi> or
<hi>nob,</hi> frequently gives a <pb n="670" facs="tcp:1252700302:245"/> delicious flavour to
the liquor, eſpecially when, as I have known it happen, joining the lips of
the glaſſes has made the prelude to a meeting between the lips of the
parties: but he could not be prevailed on to accept a glaſs of claret from
the faireſt hand, though a kiſs were ſure to follow it. I have known him
ſo very nice, as to refuſe a glaſs of ſack filled with walnuts, which
had been peeled by the ſnowy fingers of a beautiful young lady; though I have
ſeen him ſmack his lips after a glaſs of raiſin wine, in which his
prudent mother had been dabbling with her ſnuffy finger, in order to fiſh
out the ſmall particles of cork, which might poſſibly have choaked him.
If a lady drops her fan, he ſits without any emotion, and ſuffers her to
ſtoop for it herſelf; or if ſhe ſtrikes her tea-cup againſt the
ſaucer to give notice that it is empty, he pays no regard to the ſignal,
but ſees her walk up to the tea-table, without ſtirring from his chair. He
would rather leave the moſt celebrated beauty, in croſſing the ſtreet,
to the mercy of a drayman, than truſt her with his little finger: though at
the ſame time ſhould his mother be ſo diſtreſſed, he would not
ſcruple to bear as much of her weight as he could ſtand under, and to
redeem her ſilk ſtockings from jeopardy would even expoſe his own.</p>
                     <p>ONE would imagine, that this extreme coyneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
in which he ſo remarkably differs from the generality of his own ſex, would
in another reſpect as effectually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him from the generality of
women: I mean, that being leſs polite in his addreſs than a footman, we
ſhould hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find him more loquacious than a chambermaid. But
this is really the caſe. Suffer him to take the lead in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and
there are certain topicks, in which the moſt <pb n="671" facs="tcp:1252700302:246"/> prating
goſſip at a chriſtening would find it difficult to cope with him. The
ſtrength of his conſtitution is his favourite theme: he is conſtantly
attempting to prove, that he is not ſuſceptible of the leaſt injury from
cold; though a hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his voice, and the continual interruptions of
a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive cough, give him the lye in his throat at the end of every
ſentence. The inſtances, indeed, by which he endeavours to prove his
hardineſs, unluckily rather tend to convince us of the delicacy of his frame,
as they ſeldom amount to more, than his having kicked off the bed-choaths in
his ſleep, laid aſide one of his flannel waiſtcoats in a hot day, or
tried on a new pair of pumps before they had been ſufficiently aired. For the
truth of theſe facts he always appeals to his mamma, who vouches for him with
a ſigh, and proteſts that his careleſſneſs would ruin the
conſtitution of a horſe.</p>
                     <p>I AM now coming to the moſt extraordinary part of his
character. This puſillanimous creature thinks himſelf, and would be
thought, a Buck. The noble fraternity of that order find, that their reputation
can be no otherwiſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, than by prevailing on an <hi>Iriſh</hi>
chairman now and then to favour them with a broken head, or by conferring the
ſame token of their eſteem on the unarmed and defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs waiters at a
tavern. But theſe exploits are by no means ſuited to the diſpoſition of
our hero: and yet he always looks upon his harmleſs exploits as the bold
frolicks of a Buck. If he eſcapes a nervous fever a month, he is quite a
Buck: if he walks home after it is dark, without his mamma's maid to attend
him, he is quite a Buck: if he ſits up an hour later than his uſual time,
or drinks a glaſs or two of wine without water, he calls it a debauch; and
becauſe his <pb n="672" facs="tcp:1252700302:247"/> head does not ache the next morning, he is
quite a Buck. In ſhort, a woman of the leaſt ſpirit within the precincts
of <hi>St. James</hi>'s would demoliſh him in a week, ſhould be pretend to
keep pace with her in her irregularities: and yet he is ever dignifying
himſelf with the appellation of a Buck.</p>
                     <p>NOW might it not be giving this gentleman a uſeful hint, Mr.
TOWN, to aſſure him, that while milk and water is his darling liquor, a
Bamboo cane his Club, and his mother the ſole object of his affections, the
world will never join in denominating him a Buck: That if he fails in this
attempt, he is abſolutely excluded from every order in ſociety; for
whatever his deſerts may be, no aſſembly of antiquated virgins can ever
acknowledge him for a ſiſter, nature having as deplorably diſqualified
him for that rank in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as he has diſqualified himſelf for
every other: And that, though he never can arrive at the dignity of leading
apes in hell, he may poſſibly be condemn'd to dangle in that capacity, at
the apron-ſtring of an old maid in the next world, for having ſo abominably
reſembled one in this.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has for a long time been obſervable that the ladies
heads have run much upon wheels, but of late there has appeared a ſtrange
kind of inverſion, for the wheels now run upon the ladies heads. As this
aſſertion may probably puzzle many readers, who pay no attention to the
rapid and whimſical revolutions of modern taſte, it will be neceſſary
to inform them that inſtead of a cap, the preſent mode is for every female
of faſhion to load her head <pb n="674" facs="tcp:1252700302:249"/> with ſome kind of
carriage; whether they are made with broad wheels or not I cannot determine,
however, as they are undoubtedly excluded the Turnpike Act, it is by no means
material. Thoſe heads which are not able to bear a coach and ſix (for
vehicles of this ſort are very apt to crack the brain) ſo far act
conſiſtently with prudence as to make uſe of a poſt chariot, or a
ſingle horſe chaiſe with a beau perching in the middle.</p>
                     <p>THE curioſity I had of knowing the purport of this
inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the general name of theſe machines led me to make enquiry
about them of a faſhionable milliner at the court end of the town. She
obliged me with the ſight of one of theſe equipages, deſigned for the
head of a lady of quality, which I ſurveyed with much admiration; and
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it on the palm of my hand, could not help fancying myſelf like
<hi>Gulliver</hi> taking up the Empreſs of <hi>Lilliput</hi> in her
ſtate-coach. The vehicle itſelf was conſtructed of gold threads, and was
drawn by ſix dapple greys of blown glaſs, with a coachman, poſtilion, and
gentleman within, of the ſame brittle manufacture. Upon further enquiry, the
milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner told me with a ſmile, that it was difficult to give a reaſon for
inventions ſo full of whim, but that the name of this ornament (if it may be
called ſuch) was a <hi>Capriole</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briole</hi>; which we may
trace from the ſame original with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word
<hi>Caprice,</hi> both being derived from the <hi>French</hi> word
<hi>cabrer,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>to prance like an horſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT is not to be doubted, but that this faſhion took its
riſe among the ladies from their fondneſs for equipage; and I dare ſay,
that every fair one, who carries a coach and ſix upon her head, would be glad
to be carried with equal ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor <pb n="675" facs="tcp:1252700302:250"/> in a coach of her
own. I would, therefore propoſe a ſcheme, which might render this
whimſical mode of ſome kind of ſervice to both ſexes; by which the
ladies may give a tacit hint of their inclinations without the leaſt breach
of modeſty, the men may prevent the danger and inconvenience attending the
preſent method of advertising for wives, and the whole courſe of a modern
courtſhip may be carried on by means of this new head-dreſs.</p>
                     <p>INSTEAD of a <hi>Capriole</hi> ſuppoſe this capital
decoration was called a <hi>Scutcheon</hi> of <hi>Pretence,</hi> which muſt
not here be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as a Term of <hi>Heraldry,</hi> but as an invitation
to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. Thus if a lady preſumes that ſhe has a right either from her
wit, beauty, merit, or fortune, to pretend to a ſet of horſes, let ſix
bright bays, blacks, or greys prance down one ſide of her head, and according
to the rank ſhe inſiſts upon, let a ducal, or an earl's coronet, or a
bloody hand be diſtinguiſhed upon her <hi>Capriole.</hi> The females of
leſs ambition may likewiſe expreſs their inclinations by a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariot
and pair; and even thoſe who, from a due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the low
condition of the funds, are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending as to ſtoop to a plain cit,
have nothing to do but to fix upon their heads a ſingle horſe chaiſe,
filled with a loving couple, ſticking as cloſe together as two dried figs.
As to thoſe who have raſhly vowed virginity, if their great proneneſs to
cenſure the reſt of their ſex, and the fretfulneſs of their aſpect,
be not ſufficient indications to keep the men at a diſtance, they may erect
upon their noddles a formal female ſeated in a Sulky, fooliſhly pleaſed
with having the whole vehicle to herſelf, and awkwardly exerciſing the
imaginary power of having the ſole command of the reins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="676" facs="tcp:1252700302:251"/>AS a farther means of facilitating this
new method of courtſhip, I muſt beg leave to propoſe, that every lady's
boſom ſhould, inſtead of a pendent croſs, which ſavours of popery, be
ornamented with a chain and locket, ſomething like thoſe bottle-tickets
which direct us to port, claret, or burgundy, upon which might be curiouſly
engraved the numbers two hundred, five hundred, or a thouſand, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
the ſettlement expected. But to thoſe female <hi>Quixotes</hi> who ſcorn
the <hi>Capriole,</hi> and erect <hi>Windmills</hi> upon their heads inſtead
of it, I ſhall offer a word of advice worthy their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is, that
they would provide a pipe of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, to be conveyed from theſe
machines to the brain, and conſtituted upon the model of the ingenious Dr.
<hi>Hale</hi>'s ventilators, that, whenever the ſails of the Windmill are put
into motion by the external air, they may draw off all pernicious vapours which
may occaſion a vertigo in the inſide, as well as on the outſide of their
heads.</p>

               <p>I AM much pleaſed with the propoſal of my ingenious
correſpondent, and think it particularly well adapted to the preſent
diſpoſition of the ladies. A fondneſs for ſhowy equipages is now become
one of their darling paſſions; and the ſplendor in which they are to be
maintained ſeems to be one of the chief conſiderations in modern matches.
If a fine lady can be carried to court in a chair richly ornamented, or roll to
the opera in a gilt chariot, ſhe little considers with how diſagreeable a
companion ſhe goes through the journey of life: and a polite female would no
more fix her affections on a man, who drives but a beggarly pair, than ſhe
could be content to be tumbled down to his country ſeat, like
<hi>Punch</hi>'s wife to <hi>Rumford,</hi> in a wheel-borrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="677" facs="tcp:1252700302:252"/>BUT as the ladies have ſtrongly
manifeſted this paſſion for equipage, the gentlemen, I ſuppoſe out of
mere gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and in order to further the gratification of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
have taken great pains to convert themſelves into coachmen, grooms, and
jockies. The flapped hat, the jemmy frock with plate buttons and a leathern
belt, and the pride which ſome young men of quality take in driving, are all
calculated the better to qualify them for being the ladies humble ſervants. I
am therefore for extending my corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent's ſcheme: and as the ladies
now adorn their heads with the ſign of a coach and ſix, like the door of a
<hi>Meuſe</hi> alehouſe, I would have the gentlemen alſo bear theſe
emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical vehicles; by which the other ſex may, by a ſingle glance at a
lover's head, ſee in what ſtate they will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; as we know a
clergyman by his roſe, or an officer by his cockade.</p>
               <p>THE pretty fellows, who ſtudy dreſs, might ſhew a great
deal of invention in ſuiting their <hi>Caprioles</hi> to their
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Any nobleman or gentleman, who has the honour to be a
<hi>Knowing one,</hi> might ſhew his affection for the turf by carrying the
horſe and jockey; another, who is an excellent driver, might bear his own
figure exalted in a <hi>Phaeton</hi>; and a third, who thinks of picking up a
partner for life, that can be pleaſed with a <hi>tête-a-tête</hi>
or ſober picpuet party with her huſband, may bear a
<hi>vis-à-vis.</hi> In a word, all the different propoſals of various
ſuitors might be made by means of theſe ornaments, which might be worn over
the foreheads of the beaux, like the white horſe in the grenadiers caps; and
the ladies might be as much ſmitten with a promiſing <hi>Capriole</hi> on
the head of a lover, as heretofore with an elegant perriwig.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="678" facs="tcp:1252700302:253"/>IF this mode ſhould prevail, the
concluding a treaty of marriage between two perſons of quality might be
conſidered in the ſame light, and expreſſed in the ſame terms as
<hi>making a match</hi> at <hi>New-market</hi>; and inſtead of the hackneyed
phraſes at preſent uſed by our news-writers, we might perhaps ſee the
important articles in the public papers, concerning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages drawn up after
the following manner.</p>
               <q> 
                  <p>We hear that a match will be ſhortly made between the mourning
coach and ſix of a merchant's widow with a great jointure, and an hunter, in
fine order, belonging to a younger brother of a noble family.</p> 
                  <p>A running horſe, highly valued for his blood, is expected to
ſtart ſoon with a young filly from Yorkſhire. Many thouſand pounds are
depending on this match.</p> 
                  <p>A few days ago a young fellow from <hi>Ireland,</hi> mounted on
a ſingle horſe, attacked an heireſs in her coach and ſix. The lady made
little or no reſiſtance, and ſuffered herſelf to be taken out of the
coach, and carried off behind him.</p> 
                  <p>A gay coach and ſix, belonging to a young heir juſt of age,
came to town laſt week in great ſplendor, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be matched
with an equipage of the ſame kind: but having unfortunately run againſt
<hi>Arthur</hi>'s chocolate-houſe, it broke down, and the owner was very much
hurt.</p> 
                  <p>We hear from <hi>Bath,</hi> that the poſt-chaiſe of a young
lady of great beauty lately made its appearance in the long room, and ſoon
after went off with the landau of a neighbouring country ſquire.</p> 
                  <p>We are alſo informed from the ſame place, that an
old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhioned two-wheel chaiſe with a ſingle horſe, contrived to hold
only one perſon, had drove about the walks for ſome time; but having
joſtled againſt the Sulky of an old batchelor in his grand climacteric, it
was judged expedient to join them together; when they formed a moſt agreeable
<hi>vis-a-vis,</hi> for the mutual accommodation of both parties.</p>

               <p>BUT the full diſplay of modern polite learning is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in the decorations of parks, gardens, &amp;c. and centered in that important
monoſyllable, Taſte. Taſte comprehends the whole circle of the polite
arts, and ſheds its influence on every lawn, avenue, graſs-plat, and
parterre. Taſte has peopled the walks and gardens of the great with more
nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous inhabitants than the ancient Satyrs, Fauns and Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads. While
infidelity has expunged the Chriſtian Theology from our creed, Taſte has
introduced the heathen Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy into our gardens. If a pond is dug,
<hi>Neptune,</hi> at the command of Taſte, emerges from the baſon, and
preſides in the middle; or if a viſta is cut through a grove, it muſt be
terminated by a <hi>Flora</hi> or an <hi>Apollo.</hi> As the ancients held that
every ſpot of ground had its guardian Genius, and that woodland deities were
pegged in the knotty entrails of every tree, ſo in the gardens laid out by
modern Taſte every walk is peopled with gods and goddeſſes, and every
corner of it has its tutelar-deity. Temples are erected to all the train of
gods and goddeſſes mentioned in <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> which
edifices as well as their ſeveral ſtatues are adorned with <hi>Latin</hi>
or <hi>Greek</hi> inſcriptions; while the learned owner won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at his own
ſurpriſing ſtock of literature, which he ſees drawn out at large before
him, like the whole knowledge of an apothecary inſcribed upon his
gallipots.</p>
               <p>THESE perſons of Taſte may be conſidered as a ſort of
learned idolaters, ſince they may be almoſt ſaid to adore theſe graven
images, and are quite enthuſiaſtic in their veneration

                     <p>AT a time when all wiſe heads are conſidering of ways and
means to raiſe taxes, that may prove the leaſt oppreſſive to indigence,
and moſt effectually reſtrictive of luxury, permit me to propoſe (as a
ſupplement to the thoughts of one of your correſpondents on this ſubject)
a national tax upon Gods.</p>
                     <p>IT is a ſtrange but an undeniable truth, Mr. TOWN, that if
you and I were to travel through <hi>England,</hi> and to viſit the citizen
in his country box, the nobleman at his ſeat, the eſquire at the
hall-houſe, and even the divine at his parſonage, we ſhould find the
gardens, avenues, and groves, belonging to each manſion, ſtuffed and
ornamented with Heathen Gods.</p>
                     <p>IN the preſent declining ſtate of our eſtabliſhed
religion, I almoſt tremble to conſider what may be the conſequences of
theſe ready-made deities. Far be it from me to ſuppoſe that the great and
the rich will worſhip any God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but ſtill I am induced to fear
that the poor and the vulgar, when they find all other worſhip ridiculed and
laid aſide, may fooliſhly take to theſe molten images, and adore every
leaden godhead they can find. If a tax on wheels has put down ſome hundreds
of coaches, by a parity of reaſon, a tax upon gods may pull down an equal, if
not a greater <pb n="682" facs="tcp:1252700302:257"/> number of ſtatues. I would alſo offer
another propoſal; which is this: That an oak be immediately planted,
where-ever a ſtatue has been taken away, by which means thoſe vaſt woods,
which of late years have been cut down in <hi>England,</hi> to ſupply the
immediate neceſſities of the illuſtrious <hi>Arthurites</hi> in St.
<hi>James</hi>'s-ſtreet, may be in ſome meaſure ſupplied to future
generations.</p>
                     <p>AMONG our preſent taxes ſome of them fall upon branches of
ſplendor not totally luxurious. Wheel carriages may be neceſſary: want of
health or lameneſs of limbs may require them: but what neceſſities can we
pretend for ſtatues in our gardens, <hi>Penates</hi> in our libraries, and
<hi>Lares</hi> on every chimney-piece? I have remarked many wild whims of this
kind, that have appeared ſubmiſſions, if not attachments, to idolatry. A
gentleman of my acquaintance has deſtroyed his chapel, merely becauſe he
could not put up ſtatues in it, and has filled his garden with every god,
that can be found in <hi>Spence</hi>'s <hi>Polymetis:</hi> Another of my
friends, after having placed a <hi>Belvidere Apollo</hi> very conſpicuouſly
and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon the top of a mount, has erected an Obeliſk to the Sun: and
this expence he has not put himſelf to for the beauty of the Obeliſk, for
it is not beautiful, nor again for the ſplendor of the planet, which is of
pewter double gilt, but only becauſe being in poſſeſſion of copies or
originals of every deity that <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> could boaſt,
he was reſolved to have the God of <hi>Perſia</hi> to compleat his
collection. A poll-tax therefore upon gods and goddeſſes, be their
repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation what it will, Suns, Dogs, Moons, or Monkies, is abſolutely
neceſſary, and would infallibly bring in a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to the
ſtate.</p>

                        <pb n="683" facs="tcp:1252700302:258"/>HAPPENING to be the other day at
<hi>Slaughter</hi>'s coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in St. <hi>Martin's Lane,</hi> I ſaw two
very fine ſtatues of <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> brought out of Mr.
<hi>Roubilliac</hi>'s gate, and expoſed to view before they were nailed up,
and carted. The boy of the houſe told us, they were to be placed upon the top
of Sir <hi>Thomas —</hi>'s chapel in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Is it for ſuch as theſe, obſerved a

that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend ſaints and martyrs have been deſtroyed, and pounded into

are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to worſhip the images of chriſtians, muſt naturally
conclude that the proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> worſhip the
images of heathens?"</q> I confeſs I was at a loſs how to anſwer the

<hi>India</hi> can produce. I will not preſume to infer that the ladies

<hi>French</hi> approach to their china than to their chapels, and would
ſooner give up a favourite lap-dog, than a groteſque chimney-piece figure
of a <hi>Chineſe</hi> ſaint with numberleſs heads and arms. I have not
yet digeſted my thoughts in what manner the fair ſex ought to be taxed. It
is a tender point, and requires conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. At preſent, I am of

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> REMEMBER when I was very young, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation carried me to
viſit a gentleman who had wrote ſome pieces that had been very well
received, and made me very happy by promiſing to introduce me to an Author.
As ſoon as I came, I ſurveyed his whole perſon from top to toe with the
ſtricteſt attention, ſat open-mouthed to catch every ſyllable that he
uttered, and noticed his voice, manner, and every word and geſture with the
minuteſt obſervation. I could not help whiſpering to myſelf the whole
evening, 
<q rend="inline">"I am in company with an Author,"</q> and waited
with the moſt anxious impatience to hear him deliver ſomething that 
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:1252700302:261"/> might diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of mankind.
The gentleman behaved with great chearfulneſs and politeneſs; but he did
not at all anſwer the idea which I had conceived of an Author, and I went
away exceedingly diſappointed, becauſe I could not find any ſtriking
difference between him and the reſt of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>THERE is no character in human life, which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of
more frequent ſpeculation among the vulgar, than an Author. Some look on him
with contempt, and others with admiration; but they all agree in believing him
to be ſomething different from all other people: and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable with
what greedineſs they attend to any little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdotes, which they can pick up
concerning his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. He is, indeed, a kind of an ideal
being, of which people conceive very different notions. By ſome he is
ſuppoſed never to ſtir out of a garret, to wear a ruſty black coat,
dirty ſhirt, and darned ſtockings, and to want all the neceſſaries as
well as conveniences of life; while others regard him as a creature ſuperior
to the reſt of mortals, and endowed with ſomething more than reaſon. One
part therefore is ſurpriſed to ſee him walk abroad, and appear as well
dreſſed as other people; and another is diſappointed, when they find him
talk and act, and fill the offices of life, no better than any other common
man.</p>
               <p>NOR is it leſs curious to conſider the different ideas they
conceive of the manner in which the buſineſs of writing is executed. The
novice in literature, ſmit with the love of ſacred ſong, but not yet dipt
in ink, ſuppoſes it all rapture and enthuſiaſm, and in imagination
ſees the Author running wildly about his room, talking poetry to the chairs
and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; <pb n="687" facs="tcp:1252700302:262"/> while the mechanick conſiders him as
working at his trade, and thinks he can ſet down to write whenever he
pleaſes, as eaſily as the ſmith can labour at his forge, or a carpenter
plane a board. Indeed he regards the Author with ſome veneration as a
ſcholar; but writing appears to him a mighty eaſy buſineſs, and he
ſmiles whenever he hears any body mention the labour of it; nor has he the
leaſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind's being fatigued with thinking, and the fancy
harraſſed with perſuing a long train of ideas.</p>
               <p>AS people are led frequently to judge of a man from his ordinary
converſation, ſo it is common for them to form an idea of the author's
diſpoſition from the peculiar turn and colour of his writings: they expect
a gloom to be ſpread over the face of a mathematician; a controverſial
writer muſt be given to wrangling and diſpute; and they imagine that a
ſatiriſt muſt be made up of ſpleen, envy, and ill-nature. But this
criterion is by no means certain and determinate: I know an author of a
tragedy, who is the merrieſt man living; and one who has wrote a very witty
comedy, though he will ſit an hour in company without ſpeaking a word. Lord
<hi>Buckhurſt</hi> is celebrated for being 
<q rend="inline">"the beſt good man with the worſt-natured
muſe;"</q> and Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was remarkably ſhy and reſerved in
converſation. I remember I once fell into company with a painter, a poet, a
divine, and a phyſician, who were no leſs famous for their wit and humour,
than for their excellence in their ſeveral profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After the
uſual common topics were diſcuſſed, the phyſician and the poet fell
into a diſpute concerning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, the divine ſmoked his pipe
quietly without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a word, while the painter and myſelf formed a
privy <pb n="688" facs="tcp:1252700302:263"/> council for the good of the nation. Thus were it
poſſible to conjure up the ſpirits of the moſt eminent wits in former
ages, and put them together, they would perhaps appear to be very dull company.
<hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Addiſon</hi> would probably ſit ſtaring at each
other without opening their mouths; <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Steele</hi> would
perhaps join in commendation of the liquor; and <hi>Swift</hi> would in all
likelihood divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſucking his cheeks, drawing figures in the
wine ſpilt upon the table, or twirling the cork-ſcrew round his finger.</p>
               <p>THE ſtrange prejudices which ſome perſons conceive
againſt Authors, deter many a youth from drawing his pen in the ſervice of
literature: or if he ventures to commit a favourite work to the preſs, he
ſteals to the printer's with as much caution and privacy, as he would
perhaps, on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, to a ſurgeon. He is afraid that he ſhall
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his character by being known to have written any thing, and that the
genteel part of his acquaintance will deſpiſe him as a low wretch, as
ſoon as they diſcover him to be an Author: as if merely the appearing in
print was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to a gentleman, and the <hi>imprimatur</hi> to his
works was no more than a ſtamp of ſhame and ignominy. Theſe are the
terrors, which at firſt diſturb the peace of almoſt every Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and
have often put me in mind of the exclamation of that writer, who cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"O, that mine enemy had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a
book!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>THESE fearful apprehenſions are perhaps no unlucky drawback on
the vanity natural to all Authors, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they often conceal or
ſuppreſs, out of deference to the world: but if this falſe modeſty is
too much che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, <pb n="689" facs="tcp:1252700302:264"/> it muſt of courſe damp all
genius, and diſcourage every literary undertaking. Why ſhould it be
diſgraceful to exert the nobleſt faculties given us by nature? and why
ſhould any man bluſh at acquitting himſelf well in a work, which there is
ſcarce one in five hundred has a capacity to perform? Even ſuppoſing an
Author to ſupport himſelf by the profit ariſing from his works, there is
nothing more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, ſcandalous or mean in it, than an officer in the
army (the politeſt of all profeſſions) living on his commiſſion.
Senſe and genius are as proper commodities to traffick in as courage, and an
Author is no more to be condemned as an hackney ſcribbler, though he writes
at the rate of ſo much <hi>per</hi> ſheet, than a Colonel ſhould be
deſpiſed as a mercenary and a bravo, for expoſing himſelf to be
ſlaſhed, ſtuck, and ſhot at for ſo much <hi>per</hi> day. The truth
is, that Authors themſelves often create the evils they complain of, and
bring a diſgrace on the ſervice of literature, by being aſhamed to wear
the badge of it. <hi>Voltaire,</hi> in his <hi>letters on the</hi> Engliſh,
relates a remarkable inſtance of this kind of falſe pride in our own
<hi>Congreve. Voltaire,</hi> when he was in <hi>England,</hi> waited on
<hi>Congreve,</hi> and told him that he was glad of an opportunity of paying
his reſpects to a writer ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for his wit and humour.
<hi>Congreve</hi> received him po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely enough, but told him that he ſhould
be glad to ſee him as a common gentleman, but would not be conſidered or
converſed with as an Author. The <hi>French</hi> writer was a good deal
ſurpriſed at ſuch a ridiculous piece of delicacy, and could not help
telling him, that he thought this nicety ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary, for that
if he had been no more than a common gentleman, he ſhould never have had any
deſire of ſeeing him.</p>
               <p>I HAVE often pleaſed myſelf with reflecting on the
differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opinions, which my readers muſt have formed of me, ſince my
firſt appearance as an Author. As poverty is one of the general
characteriſtics of our brotherhood, thoſe who indulge themſelves in a
contempt of writers, have, I doubt <pb n="690" facs="tcp:1252700302:265"/> not, often painted me
to their own imagination in a very groteſque taſte. Their ideal caricatures
have perhaps often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented me lodged at leaſt three ſtories from the
ground, compoſing diſſertations on the modern taſte in architecture: at
another time I may have been delineated ſitting in a tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered night-gown and
the breeches of a heathen philoſopher, writing ſatires on the preſent
modes in dreſs: and ſometimes perhaps they have figured me half ſtarved
for want of a hearty meal, penning invectives againſt luxury and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</p>
               <p>BUT while theſe have reduced me to this low condition, and 
<q rend="inline">"ſteeped me in poverty to the very lips,"</q>
I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that ſome few have beſtowed on me an extraordinary
ſhare of virtue and underſtanding. After ſo many grave leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt the vices and luxury of the preſent age, they will naturally
ſuppoſe, that I never riſked a farthing at the gaming-table, never kept a
miſtreſs, would decline an invitation to a turtle-feaſt, and rather than
be provoked to fight a duel, would take a kick on the breech, or tweak by the
noſe, with all the calmneſs and reſignation imaginable. As to my wit and
humour, I ſhould bluſh to ſet down the many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments I have had from
ſeveral unknown correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents on that head: and I once received a note
from a very honeſt gentleman, who deſired to ſpend an evening with me,
promiſing himſelf great diverſion in cracking a bottle with the facetious
Mr. TOWN.</p>
               <p>THESE various opinions of me as an Author, I ſhall never
labour to reconcile, but ſhall be equally contented with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing or
amuſing the gentle reader, whether he conſiders my papers as favours
ſhowered down upon him from a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller's garret in <hi>Grub Street,</hi>
or iſſuing from my own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However this may be, I ſhall never
think it a diſgrace to have written, or be aſhamed to be conſidered as an
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and if ever Mr. <hi>Voltaire</hi> ſhould think proper to viſit
<hi>England</hi> again, I ſhall be very glad of a literary chat with him, and
will give him a very gracious reception.</p>

but in good truth, I have neither a fortune, a conſtitution, nor a temper
that will enable me to chuckle and ſkake my ſides, while I ſuffer more

could poſſibly inflict upon me: nor do I ſee any reaſon why 
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:1252700302:267"/> I ſhould ſo far move the mirthful indignation of the
ladies, as to be teized and worried to death in mere ſport, for no earthly
reaſon, but that I am what the world calls, an Old Bachelor.</p>
                     <p>THE female part of my acquaintance entertain an odd opinion,
that a Bachelor is not in fact a rational creature, at leaſt that he has not
the ſenſe of feeling in common with the reſt of mankind; that a Bachelor
may be beat like a ſtock-fiſh, that you may thruſt pins into his legs,
and wring him by the noſe; in ſhort that you cannot take too many liberties
with a Bachelor. I am at a loſs to conceive on what foundation theſe
romping philoſophers have grounded their hypotheſis, though at the ſame
time I am a melancholy proof of it's exiſtence, as well as of it's
abſurdity.</p>
                     <p>A FRIEND of mine whom I frequently viſit, has a wife and
three daughters, the youngeſt of which has perſecuted me theſe ten years.
Theſe ingenious young ladies have not only found out the ſole end and
purpoſe of my being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but have likewiſe communicated their
diſcovery to all the girls in the neighbourhood. So that if they happen at
any time to be apprized of my coming (which I take all poſſible care to
prevent) they immediately diſpatch half a dozen cards to their faithful
allies, to beg the favour of their company to drink coffee, and <hi>help
teaze</hi> Mr. <hi>Ironſide.</hi> Upon theſe occaſions, my entry into the
room is ſometimes obſtructed by a cord faſtened acroſs the bottom of
the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, which as I am a little near-ſighted, I ſeldom diſcover
till it has brought me upon my knees before them. While I am employed in
bruſhing the duſt from my black rollers, or chaſing my broken ſhins, my
wig is ſuddenly conveyed <pb n="693" facs="tcp:1252700302:268"/> away, and either ſtuffed
behind the looking-glaſs, or toſſed from one to the other ſo
dextrouſly and with ſuch velocity, that after many a fruitleſs attempt to
recover it, I am obliged to ſit down bare-headed, to the great diverſion of
the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. The laſt time I found myſelf in theſe diſtreſsful
circumſtances, the eldeſt girl, a ſprightly miſchievous jade, ſtepped
briſkly up to me, and promiſed to reſtore my wig, if I would play her a
tune on a ſmall flute ſhe held in her hand. I inſtantly applied it to my
lips, and blowing luſtily into it, to my inconceiveable ſurpriſe, was
immediately choked and blinded with a cloud of ſoot that iſſued from
every hole in the inſtrument. The younger part of the company declared I had
not executed the conditions, and refuſed to ſurrender my wig; but the
father who had a rough kind of facetiouſneſs about him, inſiſted on
it's being delivered up, and proteſted that he never knew the <hi>Black
Joke</hi> better performed in his life.</p>
                     <p>I AM naturally a quiet inoffenſive animal, and not eaſily
ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, yet I ſhall never ſubmit to theſe indignities with patience,
'till I am ſatisfied I deſerve them. Even the old maids of my acquaintance,
who one would think might have a fellow-feeling for a brother in diſtreſs,
conſpire with their nieces to harraſs and torment me. And it is not many
nights ſince Miſs <hi>Diana Grizzle</hi> utterly ſpoiled the only
ſuperfine ſuit I have in the world, by pinning the ſkirts of it together
with a red-hot poker. I own my reſentment of this injury was ſo ſtrong,
that I determined to puniſh it by kiſſing the offender, which in cool
blood I ſhould never have attempted. The ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion however which I
obtained by this imprudent revenge, was much like what a man of honour feels on
finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <pb n="694" facs="tcp:1252700302:269"/> run through the body by the
ſcoundrel who had offended him. My upper lip was transfixed with a large
corkin pin, which in the ſcuffle ſhe had conveyed into her mouth, and I
doubt not that I ſhall carry the <hi>memorem labris natam</hi> from an old
maid to the grave with me.</p>
                     <p>THESE misfortunes, or others of the ſame kind, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
daily; but at theſe ſeaſons of the year which give a ſanction to this
kind of practical wit, and when every man thinks he has a right to entertain
himſelf at his friend's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, I live in hourly apprehenſions of more
mortifying adventures. No miſerable dunghill-cock, devoted a victim to the
wanton cruelty of the mob, would be more terrified at the approach of a
<hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> were he endued with human reaſon and forecaſt,
than I am at the approach of a merry <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> or the Firſt of
<hi>April.</hi> No longer ago than laſt <hi>Thurſday,</hi> which was the
latter of theſe feſtivals, I was peſtered with mortifying preſents from
the ladies; obliged to pay the carriage of half a dozen oyſter-barrels
ſtuffed with brick-bats, and ten pacquets by the poſt containing nothing
but old news-papers. But what vexed me the moſt was the being ſent fifty
miles out of town on that day by a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit expreſs from a dying
relation.</p>
                     <p>I COULD not help reflecting with a ſigh, on the
reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the imaginary grievance of poor <hi>Tom</hi> in the
tragedy of <hi>Lear,</hi> and thoſe which I really experienced. I, like him,
was led through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; and though knives
were not laid under my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, minced horſe-hair was ſtrewed upon my
ſheets; like him I was made to ride on a hard trotting horſe, through the
moſt dangerous ways, and found at the end of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that I had only
been courſing my own ſhadow.</p>

                        <pb n="695" facs="tcp:1252700302:270"/>AS much a ſufferer as I am by the
behaviour of the women in general, I muſt not forget to remark, that the
pertneſs and ſaucineſs of an old maid, is particularly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to
me. I cannot help thinking that the virginity of theſe ancient miſſes, is
at leaſt as ridiculous as my own celibacy. If I am to be condemned for having
never made an offer, they are as much to blame for having never accepted one.
If I am to be derided for having never married, who never attempted to make a
conqueſt; they are more properly the objects of deriſion, who are ſtill
unmarried after having made ſo many. Numberleſs are the propoſals they
have rejected according to their own account; and they are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
boaſting of the havock they have formerly made among the knights, baronets,
and ſquires, at <hi>Bath, Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and <hi>Epſom</hi>; while a
tattered madrigal perhaps, a ſnip of hair, or the portrait of a
cherry-cheeked gentleman in a milk-white periwig, are the only remaining proofs
of thoſe beauties which are now withered like the ſhort-lived roſe, and
have only left the virgin thorn remaining.</p>
                     <p>BELIEVE me, Mr. TOWN, I am almoſt afraid to truſt you with
the publication of this epiſtle; the ladies whom I laſt mentioned will be
ſo exaſperated on reading it, that I muſt expect no quarter at their
hands for the future, ſince they are generally as little inclined to
forgiveneſs in their old age, as they were to pity and compaſſion in
their youth. One expedient however is left me, and which, if put in execution,
will effectually ſcreen me from their reſentment.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL be happy therefore, if by your means I may be
permitted to inform the ladies, that as fuſty an animal as they think me, it
is not impoſſible but by a little gentler <pb n="696" facs="tcp:1252700302:271"/> treatment
than I have hitherto met with, I may be huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized into a huſband. As an
inducement to them to relieve me from my preſent uneaſy circumſtances,
you may aſſure them I am rendered ſo exceeding tractable by the very
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſcipline I have undergone, that they may mould and faſhion me
to their minds with eaſe; and conſequently that by marrying me, a woman
will ſave herſelf all that trouble which a wife of any ſpirit is obliged
to take with an unruly huſband, who is abſurd enough to expect from her a
ſtrict performance of the marriage vow, even in the very minute article of
obedience: that ſo far from contradicting a lady, I ſhall be mighty well
ſatisfied if ſhe contents herſelf with contradicting me: that if I happen
at any time inadvertently to thwart her inclinations, I ſhall think myſelf
rightly ſerved if ſhe boxes my ears, ſpits in my face, or treads upon my
corns. That if I approach her lips when ſhe is not in a kiſſing humour, I
ſhall expect ſhe will bite me by the noſe; or if I take her by the hand
at an improper ſeaſon, that ſhe will inſtantly begin to pinch,
ſcratch, and claw, and apply her fingers to thoſe purpoſes which they
were certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by nature to fulfil. Add to theſe accompliſhments,
ſo requiſite to make the married ſtate happy, that I am not much turned
of fifty, can tie on my cravat, faſten a button, or mend a hole in my
ſtocking without any aſſiſtance.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOSE parents, who are unable to give their ſons an eſtate,
regard the educating them to one of the three great profeſſions of Law,
Phyſic, and Divinity, as putting them in the high road to acquire one. Hence
it happens, that nineteen parts out of twenty of our young men are brought up
with a view to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the <hi>Seals,</hi> or <hi>Warwick-Lane.</hi>
But alas! their hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of riſing by their profeſſions
are often fruſtrated, and the ſurprizing numbers engaged in running the
ſame race neceſſarily joſtle one another. For though the courts of
juſtice are tolerably ſupplied with matters of litigation; 
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:1252700302:273"/> though there are many invalids and valetudinarians; and
though great part of <hi>England</hi> is laid out into church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; yet
there is not in all the kingdom ſufficient matter for legal contention to
employ a tenth part of thoſe who have been trained to engroſs deeds in
their chambers, or to harangue at the bar: the number of patients bears no
proportion to the ſwarms of the Faculty, nor would it, though a
conſultation were to ſit on every ſick man, like carrion-flies upon a
carcaſe: and the prodigious number of reverend Divines infinitely exceeds
that of thoſe biſhopricks, deaneries, prebends, rectories, vicarages,
&amp;c. which, when they are ordained, they conceive it to be part of their
holy office to fill. From theſe frequent failures in each of the
profeſſions, the younger ſons of great men often wiſh they had been
permitted to diſgrace the family by ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile, or more plebeian
occupation; while the ſon of the mechanic curſes the pride of his father,
who inſtead of ſecuring him a livelihood in his own buſineſs, has
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to ſtarve in pudding-ſleeves, that he might do honour to his
relations by being a gentleman.</p>
               <p>THE Three Profeſſions being thus crouded with more
candidates for buſineſs and preferment, than can poſſibly be employed
or promoted, has occaſioned ſeveral irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the conduct of the
followers of each of them. The utter impoſſibility of ſupporting
themſelves in the uſual method of practiſing Law, Phyſic, or Divinity,
without clients, patients, or pariſhioners, has induced the labourers in each
of thoſe vocations to ſeek out new veins and branches. The young Solicitor,
who finds he has nothing to do, now he is out of his clerkſhip, offers his
aſſiſtance, in the tranſaction of all law affairs, by the public
papers, and <pb n="699" facs="tcp:1252700302:274"/> like the advertiſing taylors promiſes to
work cheaper than any of his brethren: while the young Barriſter, after
having exhibited his tye-wig in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> during ſeveral
terms, to no purpoſe, is obliged to forego the hope of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valling
<hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Coke,</hi> and content himſelf with being the oracle
of the courts of <hi>Jamaica.</hi> The graduate in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, finding himſelf
unſolicited for preſcription or advice, and likely to ſtarve by
practiſing Phyſic <hi>ſecundùm artem,</hi> flies in the face of
the college, and profeſſes to cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes by <hi>noſtrums</hi>
unmentioned in the diſpenſatory. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences a thriving quack, and ſoon
makes his way through the important medical degrees of walking on foot, riding
on horſeback, diſpenſing his drugs from an one-horſe-chaiſe, and
laſtly lolling in a chariot. The Divine, without living, cure, or
lectureſhip, may perhaps incur tranſportation for illegal marriages, ſet
up a theatrical-oratorical-<hi>Billingſgate</hi>-chapel under the ſhelter
of the toleration-act and the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>Clare-Market,</hi> or kindle the
<hi>inward light</hi> in the boſoms of the Saints of <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi>
and the <hi>Magdalens</hi> of <hi>Broad</hi> St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding theſe ſhoots ingrafted, as it were,
into the main body of the profeſſions, it is ſtill impoſſible for the
vaſt multitude of Divines, Lawyers, and Phyſicians to maintain themſelves
at any rate within the pale of their reſpective employments. They have often
been compelled, at leaſt to call in adventitious ones, and have ſometimes
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abandoned their original undertakings. They have frequently made
mutual tranſitions into the occupations of each other, or have perhaps
embraced other employments; which, though diſtinct from all three, and not
uſually dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with the title of Profeſſions, may fairly be
conſidered <pb n="700" facs="tcp:1252700302:275"/> in that light: ſince they are the ſole
means of ſupport to many thouſands, who toiled in vain for a
ſubſiſtance in the three Capital Ones. On theſe Profeſſions, and
their various followers, I ſhall here make ſome obſervations.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe Profeſſions is an Author. The mart of
literature is indeed one of the chief reſorts of unbeneficed Divines, and
Lawyers and Phyſicians without practice. There are at preſent in the world
of Authors, Doctors of Phyſic who (to uſe the phraſe of one of them) have
no great fatigue from the buſineſs of their profeſſion: many Clergymen,
whoſe ſermons are the moſt inconſiderable part of their compoſitions:
and ſeveral Gentlemen of the Inns of Court who, inſtead of driving the
quill over ſkins of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lead it through all the mazes of modern
novels, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and pamphlets. Many alſo have embraced this
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who were never bred to any other: and I might alſo mention
the many bankrupt tradeſmen and broken artificers, who daily enter into this
new way of buſineſs, if by perſuing it in the ſame mechanical manner as
their former occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they might not rather be regarded as following a
trade than a Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond of theſe Profeſſions is a Player. The
inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious gentlemen, who aſſume the perſons of the Drama, are compoſed
of as great a variety of characters as thoſe they repreſent. The hiſtory
of the ſtage might afford many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe who <hi>in the trade
of</hi> death <hi>might have ſlain men,</hi> who have condeſcended to deal
counterfeit ſlaughter from their right hands, and adminiſter harmleſs
phials and bowls of poiſon. We might read alſo of perſons whoſe fiſts
were intended to beat the 
<q rend="inline">"drum eccleſiaſtic,"</q> who have 
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:1252700302:276"/> themſelves become theatrical voluntiers. In regard to
the Law, many who were originally deſigned to manifeſt their talents for
elocution in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> have diſplayed them in
<hi>Drury-Lane</hi>; and it may be added on theatrical authority, that 
<q> 
                     <l>Not even <hi>Attorneys</hi> have this rage withſtood,</l> 
                     <l>But chang'd their pens for truncheons, ink for blood,</l> 
                     <l>And, ſtrange reverſe!—died for their country's
good.</l>
                  </q> I will not ſo far affront thoſe gentlemen, who were at any
time engaged in the ſtudy of the three honourable profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Law,
Phyſic, and Divinity, as to ſuppoſe that any of them, have ever taken up
the more faſhionable employment of a Pimp. Yet it is certain, that this is a
very common and lucrative Profeſſion, and that very many provide
themſelves with the neceſſaries of life, by adminiſtering to the
pleaſures of others. A convenient couſin, ſiſter, or wife, has
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proved the chief means of making a fortune; and the tongue of
ſlander has often ventured to affirm, that the price of procuration has been
paid with a place or a biſhoprick.</p>
               <p>THE moſt advantageous and genteel of all Profeſſions is
Gaming. Whoever will make this ſcience his ſtudy will find it the
readieſt way to riches, and moſt certain paſſport to the beſt
company: for the polite world will always admit any one to their ſociety, who
will condeſcend to win their money. The followers of this Profeſſion are
very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; which is indeed no wonder, when we reflect on the numbers it
ſupports in eaſe and affluence, at no greater pains than packing the cards
or cogging the dice, and no more riſk than being ſometimes tweaked by the
noſe, or kicked out of company: beſides which, this Profeſſion daily
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <pb n="702" facs="tcp:1252700302:277"/> new luſtre from the many perſons of
quality that follow it, and croud into it with as much eagerneſs, as into the
army. Among Gameſters may alſo be found Lawyers, who get more by being
maſters of all the Caſes in <hi>Hoyle,</hi> than by their knowledge of
thoſe, recorded in the report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books; Phyſicians, the chief object of
whoſe attention is the circulation of the E. O. table; and Divines, who, we
may ſuppoſe, were hinted at by a famous wit in a certain aſſembly, when
among the other benefits reſulting from a double tax upon dice, he thought
fit to enumerate, that it might poſſibly prevent the Clergy from playing at
back-gammon.</p>
               <p>BUT the more danger the more honour: and therefore no
Profeſſion is more honourable than that of a Highwayman. Who the followers
of this Profeſſion are, and with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they practiſe it, I
will not pretend to relate; as the memoirs of ſeveral of them have been
already penned by the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and as it is to be hoped
that the lives of all the preſent practitioners will be written here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by
that faithful hiſtorian. I ſhall therefore only ſay, that the preſent
ſpirit of diſſoluteneſs and freethinking muſt unavoidably bring this
honourable Profeſſion more and more into vogue, and that every Seſſions
may ſoon be expected to afford an inſtance of a
<hi>Gentleman</hi>-Highwayman.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have often amuſed myſelf with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the mean and
ridiculous ſhifts, to which the extravagant are ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. When
the certain ſupplies of a regular income are exhauſted, they are obliged to
caſt about for ready caſh, and ſet the invention to work in order to
deviſe the means of repairing their finances. Such attempts to enlarge their
revenue have frequently driven thoſe, whoſe great ſouls would not be
curbed by the ſtraitneſs of their circumſtances, into very uncommon
undertakings: they have ſent lords to <hi>Arthur</hi>'s, and ladies to
aſſemblies, or ſometimes worſe places. We may ſafely conclude, that
whoever breaks through all oeconomy, will ſoon diſcard honeſty; though
perhaps it might be deemed <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> to aver, that prodigal
men of quality have often ſold their <pb n="704" facs="tcp:1252700302:279"/> country to redeem
their eſtates, and that extravagant ladies have been known to make up the
deficiencies of their pin-money by pilfering and larceny.</p>
               <p>But one of the firſt and chief reſources of extravagance,
both in high and low life, is the Pawnbroker's. I never paſs by one of
theſe ſhops without conſidering them as the repoſitories of half the
jewels, plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in town. It is true, indeed, that the honeſt
and induſtrious are ſometimes forced to ſupply their neceſſities by
this method: but if we were to enquire, to whom the ſeveral articles in
theſe miſcellaneous warehouſes belong, we ſhould find the greateſt
part of them to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the idle and infamous among the vulgar, or
the prodigal and luxurious among the great: and if, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the
antients, who placed the Temple of Honour behind the Temple of Virtue,
propriety ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the ſituation of Pawnbrokers' ſhops,
they would be placed contiguous to a gin-ſhop, as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious print of
<hi>Hogarth,</hi> or behind a tavern, gaming-houſe, or bagnio.</p>
               <p>Going home late laſt Saturday night, I was witneſs to a
curious dialogue at the door of one of theſe houſes. An honeſt journeyman
carpenter, whoſe wife, it ſeems, had pawned his beſt cloaths, having
juſt received his week's pay, was come to redeem them, that he might appear
as fine as he uſually did on Sunday: but it being paſt twelve o'clock, the
man of the houſe, who kept up the converſation by means of a little grate
in the door, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to deliver them; though the poor carpenter begged hard
for his holiday cloaths, as the morrow was <hi>Eaſter</hi> Sunday. This
accident led me to reflect on the various perſons in town, who carry on this
kind of commerce with the Pawnbrokers, and gave occaſion to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Dream.</p>
               <p>I was ſcarce aſleep, before I found myſelf at the entrance
of a blind alley, which was terminated by a little hatch; where I ſaw a
vaſt concourſe of people, of different ages, ſex, and condition, going in
and coming out. Some of theſe, I obſerved, as they went up, very 
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:1252700302:280"/> richly dreſt; and others were adorned with jewels and
coſtly trinkets: but I could not help remarking, that at their return they
were all diveſted of their finery; and ſeveral had even their gowns and
coats ſtript off their backs. A lady, who ſtrutted up in a rich brocaded
ſuit, ſneaked back again in an ordinary ſtuff night-gown; a ſecond
retreated with the loſs of a diamond ſolitaire and pearl necklace; and a
third, who had bundled up her whole ſtock of linen, ſcarce eſcaped with
what ſhe had upon her back. I obſerved ſeveral gentlemen, who brought
their ſideboards of plate, to be melted down, as it were, into current
ſpecie: many had their pockets diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of their watches; and ſome,
even among the military gentlemen, were obliged to deliver up their ſwords.
Others of the company marched up, heavy laden with pictures, houſehold goods,
and domeſtic utenſils: one carried a ſpit; another brandiſhed a
gridiron; a third flouriſhed a frying-pan; while a fourth brought to my
remembrance the old ſign of the Dog's Head in the Porridge-pot. I ſaw
ſeveral trot up merrily with their chairs, tables, and other furniture: but I
could not help pitying one poor creature among the reſt, who, after having
ſtript his whole houſe, even to his feather-bed, ſtalked along like a
Lock-Patient, wrapt up in the blankets, while his wife accompanied him, doing
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the ſheets.</p>
               <p>As I was naturally curious to ſee the inſide of the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, where all theſe various ſpoils were depoſited, I ſtept up
to the hatch; and meeting a grave old gentleman at the threſhold, I deſired
him to inform me what place it was, and what buſineſs was tranſacted
there. He very courteouſly took me by the hand, and, leading me through a
dark paſſage, brought me into a ſpacious hall, which he told me was the
Temple of Uſury, and that he himſelf was the chief prieſt of it. One part
of this building was hung round with all kinds of apparel, like the
ſale-ſhops in <hi>Monmouth Street</hi>; another was ſtrew'd with a
variety of goods, and reſembled the brokers' ſhops in <hi>Harp Alley</hi>;
and another part was furniſhed with ſuch an immenſe quantity of jewels
and rich plate, that I ſhould rather have fancied myſelf in the Church of
the <pb n="706" facs="tcp:1252700302:281"/> Lady of <hi>Loretto.</hi> All theſe, my guide
informed me, were the offerings of that croud, which I had ſeen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting
to this Temple. The Churches in Roman-Catholic countries have commonly a
croſs fixed upon them; the <hi>Chineſe</hi> erect dragons and hang bells
about their Pagods; and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Moſques have their peculiar
hieroglyphics: but I could not help taking particular notice, that this Temple
of Uſury had its veſtibule adorned with three wooden balls painted blue;
the myſtery of which, I was told, was as dark and unfathomable as the
<hi>Pythagorean</hi> number, or the ſecret doctrines of
<hi>Triſmegiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I had in ſome meaſure ſatisfied my curioſity in
taking a general ſurvey of the Temple, my inſtructor led me to an interior
corner of it, where the moſt ſplendid offerings were ſpread upon a large
altar. This bauble, ſaid he, ſhewing me an elegant ſprig of diamonds, is
an aigret, ſent in laſt week by a lady of quality, who has ever ſince
kept home with her head muffled up in a double clout for a pretended fit of the
tooth-ache. She has at different times made an offering of all her jewels: and
beſides theſe, her whole wardrobe was very lately lodged here, which threw
her into an hyſteric fever, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined her to her bed-gown for upwards of
a month. Thoſe ear-rings and other jewels are the <hi>parapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia</hi> of
a young bride; who was ſo conſtant a votary to this place, that, when
nothing elſe remained for an offering, ſhe even brought in her
wedding-ring. You may be ſurpriſed, perhaps, to behold ſuch a variety of
necklaces, girdle-buckles, ſolitaires, and other female ornaments, as are
here collected: but it is obſervable, that their devotions in the Temple of
Uſury have been chiefly encouraged and kept alive by their aſſiſting at
the midnight orgies of Avarice.</p>
               <p>Nor are the gentlemen, continued he, leſs encouragers of our
rites. That gold watch laid ſnug, for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, in the fob of a
young man of quality; but it was one night jerked out by a ſingle throw of
the dice at a gaming-table, and made its way into the pocket of a ſtranger,
who placed it here, to keep company with ſeveral others, which have been
brought hither on a <pb n="707" facs="tcp:1252700302:282"/> ſimilar occaſion. Thoſe
brilliant buckles once glittered on the ſhoes of a very pretty fellow, who
ſet out laſt winter on his travels into foreign parts, but never got
further than <hi>Boulogne:</hi> and that ſword with the rich fillagree hilt,
and elegantly-fancied ſword-knot with gold taſſels, once dangled at the
ſide of a ſpirited Buck, who left it here two years ago, when he went off
in a great hurry to take poſſeſſion of a large eſtate in his native
country, <hi>Ireland,</hi> whence he is not yet returned. You may ſee many
others of theſe inſtruments of death, which ruſt peacefully in their
ſcabbards, as being of no uſe whatever to their owners: that, which
commonly hangs upon the vacant peg there, belongs, you muſt know, to a noble
captain: it is called upon duty once a month, and is at this inſtant mounting
guard at St. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Not far from theſe rich ornaments hung ſeveral em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
coats, laced waiſtcoats, <hi>Point d'Eſpagne</hi> hats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This ſuit, ſaid my venerable inſtructor, pointing to one richly
embroidered, was made up for a noble lord on the laſt Birth-day, and was
conveyed hither the very next morning after it had appeared at court. That
jemmy waiſtcoat with the gold-worked button-holes, on the next peg, was the
property of a ſmart templar, who, having ſpent a night out of his chambers,
ſent his waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat hither in the morning, as a penitential offering, by
his landlady. As to that heap of camblet gowns, checked aprons, and coloured
handkerchiefs, which you ſee ſtrung together a little further off, they are
oblations made here by a ſect of maudlin votaries, who reſort to this
Temple to pay their devotions to a Goddeſs, whom they have chriſtened Madam
<hi>Gin,</hi> but whom they ſometimes honour with the more proper appellation
of <hi>Strip me Naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While my conductor was thus relating the hiſtory of the
various offerings, and the perſons who had made them, he was ſuddenly
called aſide to a dark cloſet, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of which were erected near the
entrance, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not unlike the confeſſionals of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> prieſts. Theſe little boxes, I found, were appointed to
receive the votaries, who came to pay their devotions, and make their
offerings: but the neceſſary rites and ceremonies <pb n="708" facs="tcp:1252700302:283"/>
were commonly ſolemnized with as much caution and privacy, as the myſteries
of the <hi>Bona Dea</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> At preſent, however,
there was a greater noiſe and hubbub than uſual. A perſon of the firſt
rank in the kingdom, who had made ſome very conſiderable oblations of gold
and ſilver plate, was now about to celebrate a feaſt in honour of
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> in which theſe rich utenſils would be requiſite, on
which occaſion he prayed to have the uſe of them. The chief prieſt, after
having received the cuſtomary fee, granted a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for this
purpoſe, and loaded the meſſengers with a number of wrought ewers,
vaſes, and chargers, at the ſame time commiſſioning two or three of the
inferior officials of the Temple to attend the celebration of the feaſt, and
to take care that the plate was duly returned, and ſafely lodged again in the
Temple.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters were ſcarce adjuſted, before an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
incident filled the whole Temple with confuſion and diſturbance. A rude
tribe of officers broke in upon us, put a ſtop to the rites, and ſeized the
chief prieſt himſelf, charging him with having prophaned the place by a
crime almoſt as infamous as ſacrilege. He was accuſed of having
encouraged robbers to ſtrip the citizens of their moſt valuable effects,
and for a ſmall reward to depoſit them as offerings. The clamour on this
occaſion was very great, and at laſt one of the officers, methought,
ſeized me, as a party concerned; when endeavouring to clear myſelf, and
ſtruggling to get out of his clutches, I awoke.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no race of people, that has been more conſpicuous in
almoſt every relation of life, than the illuſtrious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of NONSENSE. In
every age of the world they have ſhone forth with uncommon luſtre, and have
made a wonderful progreſs in all the Arts and Sciences. They have at
different ſeaſons delivered ſpeeches from the throne, harangued at the
bar, debated in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gone amazing lengths in philoſophical
enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and metaphyſical diſquiſitions. In a word, the whole hiſtory
of the world, moral and political, is but a <hi>Cyclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedia of</hi> NONSENSE.
For which reaſon, conſidering the dignity and importance of the family, and
the infinite ſervice it has been of to me and many of my cotemporaries, 
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:1252700302:285"/> I have reſolved to oblige the public with a kind of
abſtract of the Hiſtory of NONSENSE.</p>
               <p>NONSENSE was the daughter of IGNORANCE, begot on FALSEHOOD many
ages ago in a dark cavern in BOEOTIA. As ſhe grew up, ſhe inherited all the
qualities of her parents: ſhe diſcovered too warm a genius to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
being ſent to ſchool; but while other dull brats were poring over an
horn-book, ſhe amuſed herſelf with ſpreading fantaſtical lies, taught
her by her mamma, and which have in later ages been familiarly known to us
under the names of <hi>Sham, Banter,</hi> and <hi>Humbug.</hi> When ſhe grew
up, ſhe received the addreſſes, and ſoon became the wife, of IMPUDENCE.
Who he was, or of what profeſſion, is uncertain: Some ſay he was the
ſon of IGNORANCE by another <hi>venter,</hi> and was ſuffered to become the
huſband of NONSENSE in thoſe dark ages of the world, as the
<hi>Ptolemies</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> married their own ſiſters. Some
record, that he was in the army; others, that he was an interpreter of the
laws; and others, a divine. However this was, NONSENSE and IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUDENCE were
ſoon inſeparably united to each other, and became the founders of a more
noble and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous family, than any yet preſerved on any tree of deſcent
whatſoever; of which ingenious device they were ſaid to have been the
firſt inventors.</p>
               <p>It is my chief intent at preſent to record the great exploits
of that branch of the family, who have made themſelves remarkable in
<hi>England</hi>; though they began to ſignalize themſelves very early, and
are ſtill very flouriſhing in moſt parts of the world. Many of them were
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts four thouſand years ago, and told the people,
that it was religion to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip dogs, monkeys, and green leeks: and their
deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants prevailed on the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> to build
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in honour of ſuppoſed deities, who were, in their 
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:1252700302:286"/> own eſtimation of them, whores and whore-mongers,
pickpockets and drunkards. Others roſe up ſome ages after in
<hi>Turky,</hi> and perſuaded the people to embrace the doctrine of
bloodſhed and the ſword, <hi>in the name of the moſt merciful God:</hi>
and others have manifeſted their lineal deſcent from NONSENSE and
IMPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE, by affirming that there is no God at all. There were alſo among
them many ſhrewd philoſophers; ſome of whom, though they were racked with
a fit of the ſtone, or laid up with a gouty toe, declared that they felt not
the leaſt degree of pain; and others would not truſt their own eyes, but
when they ſaw an horſe or a dog, could not tell whether it was not a chair
or a table, and even made a doubt of their own exiſtence.</p>
               <p>We have no certain account of the progreſs of NON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENSE here
in <hi>England,</hi> till after the Reformation. All we hear of her and her
progeny before that period of time is, that they led a lazy life among the
monks in cloyſters and convents, dreaming over old legends of ſaints,
drawing up breviaries and maſs-books, and ſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together ſome
barbarous <hi>Latin</hi> verſes in rhyme. In the days of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo little encouragement was given to her family, that it
ſeemed to have been almoſt extinct: but in the ſucceeding reign it
flouriſhed again, and filled the moſt conſiderable offices in the nation.
NONSENSE became a great favourite at court, where ſhe was highly careſſed
on account of her wit, which conſiſted in puns and quibbles; and the bonny
monarch himſelf was thought to take a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary delight in her
converſation. At this time, many of her progeny took orders, and got
themſelves preferred to the beſt livings, by turning the Evangeliſts into
pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and making St. <hi>Paul</hi> quibble from the pulpit. Among the
reſt, there was a biſhop, a favourite ſon of NONSENSE, of whom it is
particularly recorded, that he uſed to tickle his courtly audience, by
telling them that <pb n="712" facs="tcp:1252700302:287"/> 
                  <hi>matrimony</hi> was become a
<hi>matter of money,</hi> with many other right reverend jeſts recorded in
<hi>Joe Miller.</hi> Several bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this family were likewiſe bred to
the bar, and very gravely harangued againſt old women ſucked by devils in
the ſhape of ram-cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As an inſtance of their profound
wiſdom and ſagacity, I need only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that juſt and truly pious act
of parliament made againſt the crying ſin of witchcraft.

               </p>
               <p>In the troubleſome times of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt,
NONSENSE and her family ſided with the Parliament. Theſe ſet up new
ſects in religion: ſome of them cropt their hair ſhort, and called
themſelves the <hi>enlightened</hi>; ſome fell into trances, and pretended
to ſee holy viſions; while others got into tubs, and held forth, with many
whinings, and groans, and ſnuffling through the noſe. In the merry days of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, NONSENSE aſſumed a more gay and
libertine air; and her progeny, from fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, became downright infidels.
Several courtiers of the family wrote lewd plays, as well as luſcious
love-ſongs, and other looſe verſes, which were collected together, and
greedily bought up in miſcellanies. In the ſucceeding reign, ſome of the
kindred, who had received their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> thought
themſelves on the point of eſtabliſhing NONSENSE in church and ſtate,
and were preparing to make bonfires on the occaſion in <hi>Smithfield,</hi>
when they were obliged to leave the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Since the Revolution, the field of Politics has afforded large
ſcope for NONSENSE and her family to make <pb n="713" facs="tcp:1252700302:288"/> themſelves
remarkable. Hence aroſe the various ſects in party, diſtinguiſhed by
the names of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory, Miniſterial</hi> and <hi>Jacobite,
Sunderlandians, Oxfordians, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphinians, Bolingbrokians, Walpolians,
Pelhamians, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> names, which have kindled as hot a war
in pamphlets and journals, as the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibilines</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> or the <hi>Big</hi> and <hi>Little-Endians</hi> in the kingdom
of <hi>Lilliput.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have here endeavoured to give a ſhort abridgement of the
Hiſtory of NONSENSE; though a very ſmall part of the exploits of the family
can be included in ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious a chronicle. Some of them were very deep
ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and filled the Profeſſors' Chairs at the Univerſities. They
compoſed many elaborate diſſertations to convince the world, that two and
two make four; and diſcovered by dint of ſyllogiſm, that white is not
black. Their enquiries in Natural Philoſophy were no leſs extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:
many ſpent their lives and their fortunes in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to diſcover a
wonderful Stone, that ſhould turn every baſer metal into gold; and others
employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in making artificial wings, by the help of which they
ſhould fly up into the world of the moon. Another branch of the family took
to the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> and were the original founders of the learned
Society of <hi>Grub-Street.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Never was any aera in the annals of NONSENSE more illuſtrious
than the preſent; nor did that noble family ever more ſignally
diſtinguiſh itſelf in every occupation. In Oratory, who are greater
proficients than the progeny of NONSENSE? Witneſs many long and eloquent
ſpeeches delivered in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Chapel, in
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, at Aſſizes and Quarter-Seſſions, at
<hi>Clare-Market,</hi> and the <hi>Robin-Hood.</hi>—In Philoſophy, what
marvellous things have not been proved by NONSENSE? The ſometime
Profeſſor of Aſtronomy at <hi>Greſham</hi> College ſhewed Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> to be a mere aſs, and wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawed 
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:1252700302:289"/> the books of <hi>Moſes</hi> into a complete ſyſtem
of Natural Philoſophy: Life-guard-men have with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt certainty of
NONSENSE foretold Earthquakes; and others have penned curious eſſays on
Air-quakes, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and Comets.—In Politics, how ſucceſsfully
have the ſons of NONSENSE bandied about the terms of Court and Country? How
wiſely have they debated upon Taxes; and with what amazing penetration did
they but lately foreſee an Invaſion?—In Religion, their domain is
particularly extenſive: for, though NONSENSE is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded at leaſt from the
firſt part of the ſervice in all regular churches, yet ſhe often occupies
the whole cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at the Tabernacle and Foundery in <hi>Moorfields,</hi> and
the Chapel in <hi>Long-Acre.</hi> But for the credit of ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite an age, be
it known, that the children of NON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENSE, who are many of them people of
faſhion, are as often ſeen at the Play-houſe as at Church: and it is
ſomething ſtrange, that the family of NONSENSE is now divided againſt
itſelf, and in high conteſt about the management of their favourite
amuſement—the OPERA.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no mark of our confidence taken more kindly by a
friend, than the intruſting him with a ſecret; nor any which he is ſo
likely to abuſe. Confidantes in general are like crazy fire-locks, which are
no ſooner charged and cocked, than the ſpring gives way, and the report
immediately follows. Happy to have been thought worthy the confidence of one
friend, they are impatient to manifeſt their importance to another; 'till
between them and their friend, and their friend's friend, the whole matter is
preſently known to <hi>all our friends round the Wrekin.</hi> The ſecret
catches as it were by contact, and like electrical matter breaks forth from
every link in the chain, almoſt at the <pb n="716" facs="tcp:1252700302:291"/> ſame
inſtant. Thus the whole Exchange may be thrown into a buz to morrow, by what
was whiſpered in the middle of <hi>Marlborough Downs</hi> this morning; and
in a week's time the ſtreets may ring with the intrigue of a woman of
faſhion, bellowed out from the foul mouths of the hawkers, though at
preſent it is known to no creature living but her gallant and her
waiting-maid.</p>
               <p>AS the talent of ſecrecy is of ſo great importance to
ſociety, and the neceſſary commerce between individuals cannot be
ſecurely carried on without it, that this deplorable weakneſs ſhould be
ſo general is much to be lamented. You may as well pour water into a funnel,
or a ſieve, and expect it to be retained there, as commit any of your
concerns to ſo ſlippery a companion. It is remarkable, that in thoſe men
who have thus loſt the faculty of retention, the deſire of being
communicative is always moſt prevalent where it is leaſt to be juſtified.
If they are intruſted with a matter of no great moment, affairs of more
conſequence will perhaps in a few hours ſhuffle it entirely out of their
thoughts: but if any thing be delivered to them with an air of earneſtneſs,
a low voice, and the geſture of a man in terror for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of
it's being known; if the door is bolted, and every precaution taken to prevent
a ſurpriſe; however they may promiſe ſecrecy, and however they may
intend it, the weight upon their minds will be ſo extremely oppreſſive,
that it will certainly put their tongues in motion.</p>
               <p>THIS breach of truſt ſo univerſal amongſt us, is perhaps
in great meaſure owing to our education. The firſt leſſon our little
maſters and miſſes are taught, is to become blabs and tell-tales; they
are bribed to divulge the petty intrigues <pb n="717" facs="tcp:1252700302:292"/> of the family
below ſtairs to pappa and mamma in the parlour, and a doll or a hobby-horſe
is generally the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a propenſity which could ſcarcely be
attoned for by a whipping. As ſoon as children can liſp out the little
intelligence they have picked up in the hall or the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen, they are admired
for their wit: if the butler has been caught kiſſing the houſekeeper in
his pantry, or the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man detected in romping with the chambermaid, away
flies little <hi>Tommy</hi> or <hi>Betſy</hi> with the news; the parents are
loſt in admiration of the pretty rogue's underſtanding, and reward ſuch
uncommon ingenuity with a kiſs and a ſugar-plumb.</p>
               <p>NOR does an inclination to ſecrecy meet with leſs
encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement at ſchool. The governantes at the boarding-ſchool teach
miſs to be a good girl, and tell them every thing ſhe knows: thus, if any
young lady is unfortunately diſcovered eating a green apple in a corner, if
ſhe is heard to pronounce a naughty word, or is caught picking the letters
out of another miſs's ſampler, away runs the chit who is ſo happy as to
get the ſtart of the reſt, ſcreams out her information as ſhe goes, and
the prudent matron chucks her under the chin, and tells her that ſhe is a
good girl, and every body will love her.</p>
               <p>THE management of our young gentlemen is equally abſurd: In
moſt of our ſchools if a lad is diſcovered in a ſcrape, the impeachment
of an accomplice, as at the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> is made the condition of a
pardon. I remember a boy, engaged in robbing an orchard, who was unfortunately
taken priſoner in an apple-tree, and conducted under a ſtrong guard of the
farmer and his dairy-maid, to the maſter's houſe. Upon his abſolute
refuſal to diſcover his aſſociates, <pb n="718" facs="tcp:1252700302:293"/> the
pedagogue undertook to laſh him out of his fidelity, but finding it
impoſſible to ſcourge the ſecret out of him, he at laſt gave him up
for an obſtinate villain, and ſent him to his father, who told him he was
ruined, and was going to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit him for not betraying his
ſchool-fellows. I muſt own I am not fond of thus drubbing our youth into
treachery, and am much more pleaſed with the requeſt of
<hi>Ulyſſes</hi> when he went to <hi>Troy,</hi> who begged of thoſe who
were to have the charge of <hi>Telemachus,</hi> that they would above all
things teach him to be juſt, ſincere, faithful, and to keep a ſecret.</p>
               <p>EVERY man's experience muſt have furniſhed him with
inſtances of confidantes who are not to be relied on, and friends who are not
to be truſted; but few perhaps have thought it a character ſo well worth
their attention, as to have marked out the different degrees into which it may
be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and the different methods by which ſecrets are communicated.</p>
               <p>NED TRUSTY is a tell-tale of a very ſingular kind. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome ſenſe of his duty, he heſitates a little at the breach of it. If
he engages never to utter a ſyllable, he moſt punctually performs his
promiſe; but then he has the knack of inſinuating by a nod and a ſhrug
well-timed, or a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable leer, as much as others can convey in
expreſs terms. It is difficult, in ſhort, to determine, whether he is more
to be admired for his reſolution in not mentioning, or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in
diſcloſing a ſecret. He is alſo excellent at a 
<q rend="inline">"doubtful phraſe"</q> as Hamlet calls it, or
an 
<q rend="inline">"ambiguous giving out,"</q> and his
converſation conſiſts chiefly of ſuch broken innuendos 
<q>
                     <pb n="719" facs="tcp:1252700302:294"/> 
                     <l>As, well, I know—or, I could—an if I
would—</l> 
                     <l>Or, if I liſt to ſpeak—or, there be, an if there
might &amp;c.</l>
                  </q> Here he generally ſtops; and leaves it to his hearers
to draw proper inferences from theſe piece-meal premiſes. With due
encouragement however, he may be prevailed on to ſlip the padlock from his
lips, and immediately overwhelms you with a torrent of ſecret hiſtory,
which ruſhes forth with more violence for having been ſo long confined.</p>
               <p>POOR MEANWELL, though he never fails to tranſgreſs, is
rather to be pitied than condemned. To truſt him with a ſecret, is to
ſpoil his appetite, to break his reſt, and to deprive him for a time of
every earthly enjoyment. Like a man who travels with his whole fortune in his
pocket, he is terrified if you approach him, and immediately ſuſpects that
you come with a felonious intent to rob him of his charge. If he ventures
abroad, it is to walk in ſome unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented place, where he is leaſt in
danger of an attack. At home, he ſhuts himſelf up from his family, paces it
to and fro' in his chamber, and has no relief but from muttering over to
himſelf, what he longs to publiſh to the world; and would gladly ſubmit
to the office of town cryer, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of proclaiming it in the market
place. At length however, weary of his burthen, and reſolved to bear it no
longer, he conſigns it to the cuſtody of the firſt friend he meets, and
returns to his wife with a cheerful aſpect, and wonderfully altered for the
better.</p>
               <p>CARELESS is perhaps equally undeſigning, though not equally
excuſable. Intruſt him with an affair of the utmoſt importance, on the
concealment of which your fortune and happineſs depend: he hears you with a
kind of half-atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="720" facs="tcp:1252700302:295"/> whiſtles a favourite air, and
accompanies it with the drumming of his fingers upon the table. As ſoon as
your narration is ended, or perhaps in the middle of it, he aſks your opinion
of his ſword-knot, damns his taylor for having dreſſed him in a
ſnuff-colour'd coat inſtead of a <hi>pompadour,</hi> and leaves you in
haſte to attend an auction; where, as if he meant to diſpoſe of his
intelligence to the beſt bidder, he divulges it with a voice as loud as the
auctioneer's; and when you tax him with having played you falſe, he is
hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for it, but never knew that it was to be a ſecret.</p>
               <p>TO theſe I might add the character of the open and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved, who thinks it a breach of friendſhip to conceal any thing from
his intimates; and the impertinent, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by dint of obſervation made
himſelf maſter of your ſecret, imagines he may lawfully publiſh the
knowledge it has coſt him ſo much labour to obtain, and conſiders that
privilege, as the reward due to his induſtry. But I ſhall leave theſe
with many other characters, which my reader's own experience may ſuggeſt to
him, and conclude with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, as a ſhort remedy for this
evil,—That no man may betray the counſel of his friend, let every man
keep his own.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>ASTE is at preſent the darling idol of the polite world, and
the world of letters; and, indeed, ſeems to be conſidered as the
quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of almoſt all the arts and ſciences. The fine ladies and
gentlemen dreſs with Taſte; the architects, whether <hi>Gothic</hi> or
<hi>Chineſe,</hi> build with Taſte; the painters paint with Taſte; the
poets write with Taſte; critics read with Taſte; and in ſhort, fidlers,
players, ſingers, dancers, and mechanics themſelves, are all the ſons and
daughters of Taſte. Yet in this amazing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundancy of Taſte few can
ſay what it really is, or what the word itſelf ſignifies. Should I
attempt to define it in the ſtile of a <hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> I muſt run
over the names of all the famous poets, painters, and ſculptors, ancient and
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern; <pb n="722" facs="tcp:1252700302:297"/> and after having pompouſly harangued on the
excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of <hi>Apelles, Phidias, Praxiteles, Angela, Rubens,
Pouſſin,</hi> and <hi>Dominichino,</hi> with a word or two on all
<hi>taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> compoſitions, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Homer, Virgil,
Taſſo, Dante,</hi> and <hi>Arioſto,</hi> I ſhould leave the reader in
wonder of my profound erudition, and as little informed as before. But as deep
learning, though more flaming and pompous, is perhaps not always ſo uſeful
as common ſenſe, I ſhall endeavour to get at the true meaning of the word
Taſte, by conſidering what it uſually imports in familiar writings and
ordinary converſation.</p>
               <p>IT is ſuppoſed by <hi>Locke</hi> and other cloſe
reaſoners, that words are intended as ſigns of our ideas: but daily
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will convince us, that words are often uſed to expreſs no ideas
at all. Thus many perſons, who talk perpetually of Taſte, throw it out as a
mere expletive, without any meaning annexed to it. <hi>Bardolph,</hi> when
demanded the meaning of the word <hi>accommodated,</hi> wiſely explains it by
ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>accommodated,</hi> ſir,
is—a—a—a—<hi>accommodated,</hi> ſir, is as if one
ſhould ſay—a—<hi>accommodated:</hi>"</q> and if in like manner,
you aſk one of theſe people <hi>What is Taſte?</hi> they will tell you
that "Taſte is a kind of a ſort of a—a—a—, in ſhort 
<q rend="inline">"Taſte is Taſte."</q> Theſe talkers muſt
be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as abſolute blanks in converſation, ſince it is
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to learn the explanation of a term from them, as they affix no
determinate meaning to any expreſſion.</p>
               <p>AMONG men of ſenſe, whoſe words carry meaning in their
ſound, Taſte is commonly uſed in one of theſe two ſignifications.
Firſt, when they give any perſon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a Man of Taſte, they
would intimate that he <pb n="723" facs="tcp:1252700302:298"/> has a turn for the polite arts,
as well as the leſſer elegancies of life; and that from his natural bent to
thoſe ſtudies, and his acquired knowledge in them, he is capable of
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing what is good or bad in any thing of that kind ſubmitted
to his judgment. The meaning at other times implied by a Man of Taſte is,
that he is not only ſo far an adept in thoſe matters as to be able to judge
of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately, but is alſo poſſeſſed of the faculty of
executing them gracefully. Theſe two ſignifications will perhaps be more
eaſily conceived, and clearly illuſtrated, when applied to our Senſual
Taſte. The Man of Taſte, according to the firſt, may be conſidered as a
<hi>Bon Vivant,</hi> who is fond of the diſhes before him, and
diſtinguiſhes nicely what is ſavoury and delicious, or flat and inſipid
in the ingredients of each: according to the ſecond, he may be regarded as
the Cook, who from knowing what things will mix well together, and
diſtinguiſhing by a nice taſte when he has arrived at that happy mixture,
is able to compoſe ſuch exquiſite diſhes.</p>
               <p>BOTH theſe ſignifications of the word will be found
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the following definition of it, which I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſeen,
and is the only juſt deſcription of the term, that I ever remember to have
met with. 
<q rend="inline">"Taſte conſiſts in a nice harmony between
the Fancy and the Judgment."</q> The moſt chaſtiſed judgment, without
genius, can never conſtitute a Man of Taſte; and the moſt luxuriant
Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unregulated by Judgment, will only carry us into wild and
extravagant deviations from it. To mix oil, vinegar, butter, milk, eggs,
&amp;c. incoherently together, would make an Olio not to be reliſhed by any
palate; and the man who has no goût for delicacies himſelf will never
compoſe a good <pb n="724" facs="tcp:1252700302:299"/> diſh, though he ſhould ever ſo
ſtrictly adhere to the rules of <hi>La Chapelle, Hannah Glaſſe,</hi> and
<hi>Martha Bradley.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf at preſent chiefly to that
ſignification of the word, which implies the capacity of exerting our own
facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the ſeveral branches of Taſte, becauſe That always includes
the other.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus ſettled what Taſte is, it may not be
unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining to examine modern Taſte by theſe rules: and perhaps it will
appear, that on the one hand its moſt pleaſing flights and raviſhing
elegancies are extravagant and abſurd, and that on the other hand thoſe who
affect a correct Taſte in all their undertakings, proceed mechanically
without ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. The firſt ſpecies of Taſte, which gives a looſe to the
imagination, indulges itſelf in caprice, and is perpetually ſtriking new
ſtrokes, is the chief regulator of the faſhion. In dreſs, it has put
hunting-poles into the hands of our gentlemen, and erected coaches and
windmills on the heads of our ladies. In equipage, it has built chariots of
<hi>papier maché,</hi> and by putting ſpotted <hi>Daniſh</hi>
horſes into the harneſs, has made our beaux look like <hi>Bacchus</hi> in
his car drawn by leopards. The ornaments, both on the outſide and inſide of
our houſes, are all <hi>Gothic</hi> or <hi>Chineſe</hi>; and whoever makes
a pagod of his parlour, throws a plank or two with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular croſs-barred
paling over a dirty ditch, or places battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on a root-houſe or a
ſtable, fits up his houſe and garden entirely in Taſte.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond ſort of Men of Taſte are to be found chiefly
among the Literati, and are thoſe, who deſpiſing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern whims to
which faſhion has given the name of Taſte, pretend to follow with the
moſt ſcrupulous exactneſs the <pb n="725" facs="tcp:1252700302:300"/> chaſte models of
the antients. Theſe are the poets who favour us with correct, epithetical,
and <hi>taſteful</hi> compoſitions; whoſe works are without blemiſh,
and conformable to the preciſe rules of <hi>Quintilian, Horace,</hi> and
<hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> and as they are intended merely for the peruſal of
perſons of the moſt refined Taſte, it is no wonder that they are above
the level of common underſtandings. Theſe too are the Critics, who in their
comments upon authors, embarraſs us with repeated alluſions to the ſtudy
of <hi>Virtù:</hi> And theſe too are the Connoiſſeurs in
Architecture, who build ruins after <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius,</hi> and neceſſaries
according to <hi>Palladio.</hi> One gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this caſt has built his
villa upon a bleak hill, with four ſpacious porticos, open on each ſide to
court the four winds; becauſe, in the ſultry regions of <hi>Italy,</hi>
this model has been thought moſt convenient; and another has, in great
meaſure, ſhut out the light from his apartments, and cut off all proſpect
from his windows, by erecting an high wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his houſe, which in
<hi>Italy</hi> has been judged neceſſary to ſcreen them from the
ſun.</p>
               <p>ARCHITECTURE ſeems indeed to be the main article, in which the
efforts of Taſte are now diſplayed. Among thoſe who are fond of exerting
their fancies in capricious innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I might inſtance the many pretty
whims, of which an infinite variety may be ſeen within ten miles of
<hi>London.</hi> But us a proof of the noble and judicious Taſte among us, I
ſhall beg leave to deſcribe, in the ſtile of a Connoiſſeur, a moſt
amazing curioſity, erected in a very polite quarter of this town.</p>
               <p>IN the midſt of a noble and ſpacious area ſtands a grand
Obeliſk. The Baſe forms a perfect ſquare with right <pb n="726" facs="tcp:1252700302:301"/> angles; the Body of it is cylindrical; but the Capital is an
Heptagon, and has ſeveral curious lines and figures deſcribed on each of
its ſeven flat ſides or ſuperfices, which ſerve to terminate as many
moſt magnificent and ſtriking Viſtas. This ſuperb Column, no leſs
remarkable than the famous Pillar of <hi>Trajan,</hi> ſeems (from the
ſeveral Gnomons and other Hieroglyphics ſtuck about it) to have been
originally dedicated to the Sun; but is now known among the vulgar by the more
common name of <hi>The Seven Dials.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH I ſhall not as yet vouchſafe to let the reader ſo
far into my ſecrets, as to inform him whether I am married or ſingle, it
may not be amiſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that ſuppoſing I ſtill remain a
batchelor, it has not been the fault of my friends or relations. On the
contrary, as ſoon as I was what they call ſettled in the world, they were
ſo aſſiduous in looking out for a wife for me, that nothing 
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:1252700302:303"/> was required on my part, but immediately to fall in love
with the lady they had pitched upon: and could I have complied with their
ſeveral choices, I ſhould have been married at the ſame time to a tall
and a ſhort, a plump and a ſlender, a young and an old woman; one with a
great deal of money, and another with none at all: each of whom were
ſeparately recommended by them as the propereſt perſon in the world for
me.</p>
               <p>I know not how it happens, but it is notorious, that moſt
people take a pleaſure in making matches; either thinking matrimony a ſtate
of bliſs, into which they would charitably call all their friends and
acquaintance; or perhaps ſtruggling in the toils, they are deſirous of
catching others in the net that enſnared them. Many matches have been brought
about between two perſons abſolute ſtrangers to each other, through this
kind mediation of our friends, who are always ready to take upon them the
office of an honourable go-between. Some have come together merely from having
been talked of by their acquaintance as likely to make a match; and I have
known a couple, who have met by accident at an horſe-race, or danced together
at an aſſembly, that in leſs than a fortnight have been driven into
matrimony in their own defence, by having been firſt paired in private
converſations, and afterwards in the common news-papers.</p>
               <p>As we cannot inſure happineſs to our friends, at the ſame
time that we help them to huſbands or wives, one would imagine that few would
care to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard <pb n="729" facs="tcp:1252700302:304"/> of beſtowing miſery, where
they meant a kindneſs. I know a good-natured lady, who has officiouſly
brought upon herſelf the ill-will and the curſes of many of her deareſt
and moſt intimate friends on this very account. She has a ſiſter, for
whom ſhe provided a moſt excellent huſband, who has ſhewn his affection
for her by ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her whole fortune upon his miſtreſſes: ſhe
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that another near relation ſhould ſnap up a rich widow, who was
arreſted for her debts within a week after marriage; and it coſt her a
whole twelvemonth to bring two doating lovers of her acquaintance together, who
parted beds before the honey-moon was expired.</p>
               <p>But if our friends will thus condeſcend to be Match-makers
from a ſpirit of benevolence, and for our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage only, there are
others who have taken up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from leſs diſintereſted
motives; who bring beauty and fortune to market, and traffick in all the
accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can make the marriage ſtate happy. Theſe traders
diſpoſe of all ſorts of rich heirs and heireſſes, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets, lords,
ladies of faſhion, and daughters of country ſquires with as much coolneſs
as drovers ſell bullocks. They keep complete regiſters of the condition and
quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of all the marriageable perſons within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and it
is as common to apply to them for an huſband or wife, as to the
regiſter-offices for a man or maid-ſervant. They may, indeed, be
conſidered as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and guardians for the greateſt part of our youth of
both ſexes, ſince in marriage they may be moſt properly ſaid to give
them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="730" facs="tcp:1252700302:305"/>It is ſomething comical to conſider
the various perſons, to whom men of this profeſſion are uſeful. We may
naturally ſuppoſe, that a young fellow, who has no eſtate, but what, like
<hi>Tinſel</hi>'s in the <hi>Drummer,</hi> is merely <hi>perſonal,</hi>
would be glad to come down handſomely after conſummation with a woman of
fortune; and a ſmart girl, who has more charms than wealth, would give round
poundage on being taken for better for worſe by a rich heir. Many a
tradeſman alſo wants a wife to manage his family, while he looks after the
ſhop; and thinks it better to recommend himſelf by this convenient friend,
than by means of the <hi>Daily Advertiſer.</hi> There are alſo ſeveral
young people, who are indifferent as to any perſon in particular, and have no
paſſion for the ſtate itſelf, yet want to be married, becauſe it will
deliver them from the reſtraint of parents. But the moſt unnatural, though
very common applications of this ſort are from the rich and the noble; who
having immenſe eſtates to beſtow on their children, will make uſe of
the meaneſt inſtruments to couple them to another of the ſame over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
fortune.</p>
               <p>I have known many droll accidents happen from the miſtakes of
theſe mercenary Match-makers, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one in particular, which I
ſhall here ſet down for the entertainment of my readers. A careful old
gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came up from the North on purpoſe to marry his ſon, and was
recommended by one of theſe couplers to a twenty thouſand pounder. He
accordingly put on his beſt wig, beſt beaver, and gold-buttoned coat, and
went to pay his reſpects to the lady's mamma: He told her, 
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:1252700302:306"/> that he had not the pleaſure of being known to her;
but as his ſon's quiet depended on it, he had taken the liberty of waiting on
her: in ſhort, he at length broke the matter to her, and informed her, that
his boy had ſeen her daughter at church, and was violently in love with her;
concluding, that he would do very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely for the lad, and would make it
worth her while to have him. The old lady thanked him for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he
intended her family; but ſhe ſuppoſed, to be ſure, as he appeared to be
a prudent and ſenſible gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he would expect a fortune
anſwerable. 
<q rend="inline">"Say nothing of that, madam, ſay nothing of
that",</q> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Don;— 
<q rend="inline">"I have heard—but if it was leſs, it
ſhould not break any ſquares between us."—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Pray, ſir, how much does the world
ſay?"</q> replied the lady.— 
<q rend="inline">"Why, madam, I ſuppoſe ſhe has not leſs
than twenty thouſand pounds.—"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Not ſo much, ſir;</hi>"</q> ſaid the
old lady, very gravely.— 
<q rend="inline">"Well, madam, I ſuppoſe then it may be
nineteen, or—or—only eighteen thouſand pounds".—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Not ſo much, ſir.;</hi>"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, well, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not: but—if it was

                  <q rend="inline">"No, ſir."—</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"Or (we muſt make allowances) perhaps but
fifteen thouſand".—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Not ſo much, ſir.</hi>"—</q>Here
enſued a profound ſilence for near a minute; when the old gentleman,
rubbing his fore-head— 
<q rend="inline">"Well, madam, we muſt come to ſome
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion—Pray is it leſs than fourteen thouſand? How much more
is it than twelve thouſand?"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Leſs, ſir."—</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"Leſs."—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"But is it more than ten thouſand?"—</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Not ſo much, ſir.</hi>"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Not ſo much, madam?"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>Not ſo much.</hi>"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why, <pb n="732" facs="tcp:1252700302:307"/> if it is lodged in
the funds, conſider, madam, intereſt is low, very low—but as the boy
loves her, trifles ſhall not part us. Has ſhe got eight thouſand

                  <q rend="inline">"Why then, madam, perhaps the young lady's
fortune may not be above ſix—or five thouſand pounds."—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"NOTHING LIKE IT, SIR."—</q>At theſe
words the old gentleman ſtarted from his chair, and running out of the
room—

                     <p>THE flatneſs and fulſom inſipidity of Dedications has
often been the ſubject of our converſation; and we have always agreed, that
Authors have miſcarried in theſe pieces of flattery, by injudiciouſly
affronting, when they meant to compliment their patrons. The humble Dedicator
loads his Great Man with virtues totally foreign to his nature and
diſpoſition, which ſit as aukwardly upon him, as lace or embroidery on a

with which he graciouſly dubs him a ſcholar, that he makes as ridiculous a

and ſhall be glad to hear your opinion of it.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>May it pleaſe your Grace!</hi> or, <hi>My Lord!</hi> or,
<hi>Sir!</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>YOU are in every point ſo complete a Fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that
the following treatiſe is but a faint tranſcript of your accompliſhments.
There is not one qualification, requiſite in the character of a man of
ſpirit, which you do not poſſeſs. Give me leave therefore, on the
preſent occaſion, to point forth your ineſtimable qualities to the world,
and hold up to the public view ſo glorious an example.</p>
                     <p>YOU diſtinguiſhed yourſelf ſo early in life, and
exalted yourſelf ſo far above the common pitch of vulgar Bucks, that you
was diſtinguiſhed, before the age of twenty, with the noble appellation of
STAG. And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many gallant exploits you have performed, the
number of raſcally poltroons you have ſent out of the world, the number of
pretty little foundlings you have brought into it, how many girls you have
debauched, how many women of quality you have intrigued with, and how many
hogſheads of <hi>French</hi> wine have run through your body, I cannot help
contemplating you as a STAG of the firſt head.</p>
                     <p>WHAT great reaſon have you to value yourſelf on your noble
Atchievements at <hi>Arthur</hi>'s! the ſums you formerly loſt, and thoſe
you have lately won, are amazing inſtances of your ſpirit and addreſs;
firſt, in venturing ſo deeply before you was let into the ſecret, and
then, in manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with ſo much adroitneſs and dexterity, ſince you 
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:1252700302:311"/> have been acquainted with it. Nobody cogs the dice, or
packs the cards half ſo ſkilfully; you hedge a bet with uncommon nicety;
and are a moſt incomparably ſhrewd judge of the odds.</p>
                     <p>NOR have your exploits on the Turf rendered you leſs famous.
Let the annals of <hi>Pond</hi> and <hi>Heber</hi> deliver down to poſterity
the glorious account of what plates you have won, what matches you made, and
how often the Knowing Ones have been taken in, when, for private reaſons, you
have found it neceſſary that your horſe ſhould run on the wrong ſide
of the poſt, or be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, after winning the firſt heat. I need not
mention your own ſkill in Horſemanſhip, and in how many matches you have
condeſcended to ride yourſelf; for in this particular it muſt be
acknowledged that you cannot be outdone even by your groom or jockey.</p>
                     <p>ALL the world will witneſs the many inſtances of your
Courage, which has been often tried and exerted in <hi>Hyde-Park,</hi> and
behind <hi>Montague-Houſe:</hi> nay, you have ſometimes been known to draw
your ſword moſt heroicly at the opera, the play, and even at private routes
and aſſemblies. How often have you put to flight a whole army of watchmen,
conſtables, and beadles, with the juſtices at their head! You have cleared
a whole bawdy-houſe before you, and taken many a tavern by ſtorm: you have
pinned a waiter to the ground, and have beſides proved yourſelf an
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent markſman, by ſhooting a poſt-boy flying. With ſo much valour
and firmneſs, it is not to be doubted, but that you would behave with the
ſame intrepidity, if occaſions called, upon <hi>Hounſlow-Heath,</hi> or
in <hi>Maiden-head-Thicket:</hi> 
                        <pb n="737" facs="tcp:1252700302:312"/> and, if it were
neceſſary, you would as boldly reſign yourſelf up to the hands of
<hi>Jack Ketch,</hi> and ſwing as genteely as <hi>Maclean</hi> or
<hi>Gentleman Harry.</hi> The ſame noble ſpirit would likewiſe enable you
to aim the piſtol at your own head, and go out of the world like a man of
honour and a gentleman.</p>
                     <p>BUT your Courage has not rendered you inſuſceptible of the
ſofter paſſions, for which your heart has been ever inclined. To ſay
nothing of your gallantries with women of faſhion, your intrigues with
milliners and mantua-makers, or your ſeducing of raw country girls, and
innocent tradeſmens daughters, you have formerly been ſo conſtant in your
devoirs to Mrs. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> and the whole ſiſter-hood, that you
ſacrificed your health and conſtitution in their ſervice. But above all,
witneſs that ſweet delicate creature, whom you have now in keeping; and for
whom you entertain ſuch a ſtrong and faithful paſſion, that for her
ſake you have tenderly and affectionately deſerted your wife and
family.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH from your elegant taſte for pleaſures you appear
made for the gay world, yet theſe polite Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not called off
your attention from the more ſerious ſtudies of Politics and Religion. In
Politics you have made ſuch a wonderful proficiency, both in theory and
practice, that you have diſcovered the good of your country to be a mere
joke, and confirmed your own intereſt, as well as eſtabliſhed your
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the proper place, by ſecuring half a dozen Boroughs. As to
Religion, you ſoon unravelled every myſtery of that, and not only know the
Bible to be as romantic as the Alcoran, but have alſo written ſeveral 
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:1252700302:313"/> volumes to make your diſcoveries plain to meaner
capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. The ridiculous prejudices of a fooliſh world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily prevent
your publiſhing them at preſent; but you have wiſely provided that they
ſhall one day ſee the light, when I doubt not they will be deemed
invaluable, and be as univerſally admired as the poſthumous works of Lord
<hi>Bolingbroke.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE notices in the public papers that the Foundling Hoſpital
will be open for the reception of all infants in general under a certain age,
have, I find, given uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſatisfaction. The conſequences of a big
belly do not appear ſo dreadful as heretofore: and it was but yeſterday
that a young fellow of intrigue told me, he was happy that his children would
no longer be thrown out of the Hoſpital, as he himſelf was out of
<hi>Arthur</hi>'s, by black balls. For my part, though I have no lady in
keeping, no child by my houſe-keeper, nor any other affair of gallantry on my
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:1252700302:315"/> hands, which makes me wiſh to ſwell the number of
infants maintained by that charity, I muſt own myſelf to be exceedingly
rejoiced at the extenſion of ſo benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a deſign. I look upon it as
the certain preſervation of many hundreds in embryo: nor ſhall we now hear
of ſo many helpleſs babes birth-ſtrangled in a neceſſary, or
ſmothered by the ditch-delivered drab. As a baſtard is accounted in law,
<hi>quaſi nullius filius,</hi> the child of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, and related to nobody,
and yet is bleſt with as fair proportions, and capable of an equal degree of
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with 
<q rend="inline">"honeſt madam's iſſue,"</q> it is ſurely
an act of great humanity thus to reſcue them from untimely deaths and other
miſeries, which They do not merit, whatever may be the guilt of their
parents.</p>
               <p>THOUGH it is obvious, that this Hoſpital will be made the
receptacle of many legitimate children, it is no leſs certain that the rich,
as well as the poor, will often ſend their baſe-born bantlings to this
general nurſery. The wealthy man of quality, or ſubſtantial cit, may have
their private family-reaſons for not owning the fruits of their ſecret
amours, and be glad to put the little living witneſs of their intrigues out
of the way. For this reaſon, an hiſtory of the Foundlings received there
would be very curious and entertaining, as it would contain many anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes not
to be learned from any Pariſh Regiſter. The reflections that paſſed in
my mind on this ſubject, gave occaſion the other evening to the following
Dream.</p>
               <p>Methought, as I was ſtanding at the private door of the
Hoſpital, where a croud of females (each of them with a child in her arms)
were preſſing to get in, an elderly gentleman, whom from his white ſtaff
I took to <pb n="741" facs="tcp:1252700302:316"/> be a governour of the charity, very
courteouſly invited me to come in. I accepted his offer; and having ſeated
myſelf next him— 
<q rend="inline">"Mr. TOWN, ſays he, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that you
look upon moſt theſe little infants as the offsprings of ſo many
unmarried fathers, and maiden-mothers, which have been clandeſtinely
ſmuggled into the world. Know then that I am one of thoſe guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Genii,
appointed to ſuperintend the fortunes of Baſtards: therefore, as this
Hoſpital is more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under my tuition, I have put on this
diſguiſe; and, if you pleaſe, will let you into the ſecret hiſtory of
thoſe babes, who are my wards, and their parents."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I aſſured him, his intelligence would be highly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and ſeveral now coming up to offer their children, he reſumed his
diſcourſe— 
<q rend="inline">"Obſerve, ſaid he, that jolly little rogue,
with plump cheeks, a florid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, blue eyes, and ſandy locks. We have
here already ſeveral of his brethren by the mother's ſide; ſome fair,
ſome brown, and ſome black: and yet they are all ſuppoſed to have come
by the ſame father. The mother has for many years been houſekeeper to a
gentleman who cannot ſee that her children bear the marks of his own
ſervants, and that this very brat is the exact reſemblance of his
coachman.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"THAT puling whining infant there, with a pale
face, emaciated body, and diſtorted limbs, is the forced pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of
viper-broth and cantharides. It is the offspring of a worn-out buck of quality,
who at the ſame time he debauched the mother, ruined her conſtitution by a
filthy diſeaſe; in conſequence of which, ſhe with much 
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:1252700302:317"/> difficulty brought forth this juſt picture of
himſelf in miniature.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"THE next that offers is the iſſue of a
careful cit; who, as he keeps an horſe for his own riding on ſundays, which
he lets out all the reſt of the week, keeps alſo a miſtreſs for his
recreation on the ſeventh day, who lets herſelf out on all the other ſix.
That other babe owes his birth likewiſe to the city, but is the joint
product, as we may ſay, of two fathers; who being great oeconomiſts in
their pleaſures as well as in their buſineſs, have ſet up a whore and
an one horſe-chaiſe in partnerſhip together.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"THAT pert young baggage there, who ſo boldly
preſſes forward with her brat, is not the mother of it, but is maid to a
ſingle lady of the ſtricteſt honour and unblemiſhed reputation. About a
twelve month, ago her miſtreſs went to <hi>Bath</hi> for the benefit of her
health; and ten months after, ſhe travelled into <hi>North Wales</hi> to
ſee a relation; from whence ſhe is juſt returned. We may ſuppoſe,
that ſhe took a fancy to that pretty babe while in the country, and brought
it up to town with her, in order to place it here; as ſhe did a few years ago
to another charming boy, which being too old to be got into this Hoſpital, is
now at a ſchool in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> where young gentlemen are boarded,
cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and educated, and found in all neceſſaries, for ten pounds a
year.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"THAT chubby little boy, which you ſee in the
arms of yonder ſtrapping wench in a camblet gown and red cloak, is her own
ſon. She is by profeſſion a bed-maker <pb n="743" facs="tcp:1252700302:318"/> in one of
the univerſities, and of the ſame college, in which the father (a grave
tutor) holds a fellowſhip under the uſual condition of not marrying. Many
ſober gentlemen of the cloth, who are in the ſame ſcrape, are glad to
take the benefit of this charity: And if all of the ſame reverend order, like
the prieſts abroad, were laid under the ſame reſtrictions, you might
expect to ſee a particular Hoſpital, erected for the reception of the Sons
of the Clergy.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"THAT next child belongs to a ſea-captain's
lady, whoſe huſband is expected to return every moment from a long voyage;
the fears of which have happily haſtened the birth of this infant a full
month before its time. That other is the poſthumous child of a wealthy old
gentleman, who had married a young girl for love, and dyed in the honey-moon.
This his ſon and heir was not born till near a twelve month after his
deceaſe, becauſe its birth was retarded by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive grief of his
widow; who on that account ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to lye-in privately, and to lodge
their only child here, than to have its legitimacy and her own honour called in
queſtion by her huſband's relations."</q>
               </p>
               <p>MY companion pointed out to me ſeveral others no leſs
extraordinary; among which I remember he told me, one was the unhallowed brood
of a Methodiſt teacher, and another the premature ſpawn of a Maid of
honour. A poor author eaſed himſelf of a very heavy load of two
twin-daughters, which in an evil hour he begot on an hawker of pamphlets, after
he had been writing a luſcious novel: but I could not help ſmiling at the
marks ſent in with theſe new Muſes, ſignifying, that one had been 
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:1252700302:319"/> chriſtened <hi>Terpſichore,</hi> and the other
<hi>Polyhymnia.</hi> Several bantlings were imported from <hi>Iſlington,
Hoxton,</hi> and other villages within the ſound of <hi>Bow Bell:</hi> many
were tranſplanted hither out of the country; and a whole litter of brats were
ſent in from two or three pariſhes in particular, for which it is doubtful
whether they were moſt indebted, to the parſon or the ſquire.</p>
               <p>A modeſt-looking woman now brought a very fine babe to be
admitted; but the governors rejected it, as it appeared to be above two months
old. The mother on the contrary perſiſted in affirming, that it was but
juſt born, and addreſſing herſelf to me, deſired me to look at it. I
accordingly took it in my arms; and while I was toſſing it up and down, and
praiſing its beauty, the ſly huſſy contrived to ſlip away, leaving
the precious charge to my care. The efforts which I made to bawl after her, and
the ſqualling of the brat which rung pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in my ears, luckily awaked
me; and I was very happy to find, that I had only been dandling my pillow
inſtead of a bantling.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LMOST every man is or has been, or at leaſt thinks that he
is or has been a Lover. One has fought for his miſtreſs, another has drank
for her, another wrote for her, and another has done all three: and yet perhaps
in ſpite of their duels, poetry, and bumpers, not one of them ever
entertained a ſincere paſſion. I have lately taken a ſurvey of the
numerous tribe of <hi>Enamoratos,</hi> and after having obſerved the various
ſhapes they wear, think I <pb n="746" facs="tcp:1252700302:321"/> may ſafely pronounce, that
though all profeſs to have been in Love, there are very few who are really
capable of it.</p>
               <p>IT is a maxim of <hi>Rochefoucault</hi>'s, that, 
<q rend="inline">"many men would never have been in Love, if they
had never heard of Love."</q> The juſtice of this remark is equal to its
ſhrewdneſs. The ridiculous prate of a family has frequently great influence
on young minds, who learn to Love, as they do every thing elſe, by imitation.
Young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, almoſt mere children, have been conſumed with this
ſecond-hand flame lighted up at another's paſſion; and in conſequence
of the loves of the footman and chambermaid, I have known little maſter fancy
himſelf a dying ſwain at the age of thirteen, and little miſs pining away
with Love in a bib and hanging ſleeves.</p>
               <p>THAT vaſt heap of volumes, filled with Love, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in number to make a library, are great inflamers, and ſeldom fail to produce
that kind of paſſion deſcribed by <hi>Rochefoucault.</hi> The chief of
theſe literary ſeducers are the old romances, and their degenerate ſpawn,
the modern no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. The young ſtudent reads of the emotions of Love, till he
imagines that he feels them throbbing and fluttering in his little breaſt; as
valetudinarians ſtudy the hiſtory of a diſeaſe, till they fancy
themſelves affected with every ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it. For this reaſon, I am
always ſorry to ſee any of this traſh in the hands of young people: I
look upon <hi>Caſſandra</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> as well as <hi>Betty
Barnes, Polly Willis,</hi> &amp;c. as no better than bawds; and conſider Don
<hi>Bellianis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and Sir <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> with
<hi>George Edwards, Loveill,</hi> &amp;c. as arrant pimps. But though romances
and novels are both equally ſtimulatives, yet their operations are very
different. <pb n="747" facs="tcp:1252700302:322"/> The romance-ſtudent becomes a fond
<hi>Corydon</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> or a very <hi>Damon</hi> of
<hi>Arcadia,</hi> and is in good truth ſuch a dying ſwain, that he believes
he ſhall hang himſelf on the next willow, or drown himſelf in the next
pond, if he ſhould loſe the object of his wiſhes: but the young
noveliſt turns out more a man of the world, and after having gained the
affections of his miſtreſs, forms a hundred ſchemes to ſecure the
poſſeſſion of her, and to bam her relations.</p>
               <p>THERE are, among the tribe of Lovers, a ſort of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
gentlemen, who can hardly be ſaid, in the language of Love, to entertain a
<hi>flame</hi> for their miſtreſs. Theſe are your men of ſuperlative
delicacy and refinement, who loath the groſs ideas annexed to the amours of
the vulgar, and aim at ſomething more ſpiritualized and ſublime. Theſe
philoſophers in Love doat on the mind alone of their miſtreſs, and would
fain ſee her naked ſoul, diverted of its material incumbrances. Gentlemen
of this complexion might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not improperly be ranged in the romantic
claſs, but they have aſſumed to themſelves the name of <hi>Platonic
Lovers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PLATONISM, however, is in theſe days very ſcarce; and there
is another claſs, infinitely more numerous, compoſed of a ſort of Lovers,
whom we may juſtly diſtinguiſh by the title of <hi>Epicureans.</hi> The
principles of this ſect are diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to thoſe of the
<hi>Platonics.</hi> They think no more of the ſoul of their miſtreſs,
than a muſſulman, but are in raptures with her perſon. A Lover of this
ſort is in perpetual extaſies: his paſſion is ſo violent that he even
ſcorches you with his flame; and he runs over the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his
miſtreſs in the ſame ſtile that a jockey praiſes his 
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:1252700302:323"/> horſe. 
<q rend="inline">"Such limbs! ſuch eyes! ſuch a neck and
breaſt! ſuch—oh, ſhe's a rare piece."</q> Their ideas go no farther
than mere external accompliſhments; and as their wounds may be ſaid to be
only ſkin deep, we cannot allow their breaſts to be ſmitten with Love,
though perhaps they may rankle with a much groſſer paſſion. Yet it
muſt be owned that nothing is more common, than for gentlemen of this caſt
to be involved in what is called a Love-match: but then it is owing to the
ſame cauſe with the marriage of Sir <hi>John Brute,</hi> who ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"I married my wife, becauſe I wanted to lie
with her, and ſhe would not let me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>OTHER gentlemen of a gay diſpoſition and warm
conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, who go in the catalogue for Lovers, are adorers of almoſt
every woman they ſee. The flame of Love is as eaſily kindled in them, as
the ſparks are ſtruck out of a flint, and it alſo expires as ſoon. A
Lover of this ſort dances one day with a lady at a ball, and loſes his
heart to her in a minuet; the next another carries it off in the mall; and the
next day perhaps he goes out of town, and lodges it in the poſſeſſion
of all the country beauties ſucceſſively, till at laſt he brings it
back to town with him, and preſents it to the firſt woman he meets. This
claſs is very numerous; but ought by no means to hold a place among the tribe
of true Lovers, ſince a gentleman who is thus in Love with every body, may
fairly be ſaid not to be in Love at all.</p>
               <p>LOVE is univerſally allowed to be whimſical; and if whim is
the eſſence of Love, none can be accounted truer Lovers, than thoſe who
admire their miſtreſs for ſome particular charm, which enchains them,
though it would ſingly never captivate any body elſe. Some gentlemen have
been won <pb n="749" facs="tcp:1252700302:324"/> to conjugal embraces by a pair of fine arms;
others have been held faſt by an even white ſet of teeth; and I know a very
good ſcholar, who was enſnared by a ſet of golden treſſes, becauſe
it was the taſte of the antients, and the true claſſical hair. Thoſe
ladies, whoſe lovers are ſuch piecemeal admirers, are in perpetual danger
of loſing them. A raſh, or a pimple may abate their affection: All thoſe,
the object of whoſe adoration is merely a pretty face or a fine perſon, are
in the power of the like accidents; and the ſmall pox has occaſioned many a
poor lady the loſs of her beauty and her Lover at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>BUT after all theſe ſpurious <hi>Enamoratos,</hi> there are
ſome few, whoſe paſſion is ſincere and well-founded. True, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Love is always built upon eſteem: not that I would mean that a man can
reaſon and argue himſelf into Love; but that a conſtant intercourſe
with an amiable woman will lead him into a contemplation of her excellent
qualities, which will inſenſibly win his heart before he is himſelf aware
of it, and beget all thoſe hopes, fears, and other extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, which are
the natural attendants on a true paſſion. Love has been deſcribed ten
thouſand times: but that I may be ſure that the little picture I would draw
of it is taken from nature, I will conclude this paper with the ſtory of
honeſt WILL EASY and his amiable wife. WILL EASY and Miſs — became
very early acquainted, and from being familiarly intimate with the whole
family, WILL might be almoſt ſaid to live there. He dined and ſupped with
them perpetually in town, and ſpent great part of the ſummer with them at
their ſeat in the country. WILL and the lady were both univerſally allowed
to have ſenſe, and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent converſations together gave them
undoubted proofs of <pb n="750" facs="tcp:1252700302:325"/> the goodneſs of each other's
diſpoſition. They delighted in the company, and admired the perfections of
each other, and gave a thouſand little indications of a growing paſſion,
not unobſerved by others, even while it was yet unknown and unſuſpected
even by themſelves. However, after ſome time WILL, by mutual agreement,
demanded the lady of her father in marriage. But alas! 
<q rend="inline">"the courſe of true Love never yet run
ſmooth:"</q> the ill-judged ambition of a parent induced the father, out of
mere love to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to refuſe her hand to the only man in the world
with whom ſhe could live happily, becauſe he imagined that he might in the
<hi>Smithfield</hi> phraſe, do <hi>better</hi> for her. But Love, grounded on
juſt principles, is not eaſily ſhaken; and as it appeared that their
mutual paſſion had taken too deep root ever to be extirpated; the father at
laſt reluctantly half-conſented to their union. They enjoy a genteel
competency, and WILL by his integrity and abilities is an honour to a learned
profeſſion, and a bleſſing to his wife; whoſe greateſt praiſe is,
that her virtues deſerve ſuch an huſband. She is pleaſed with having 
<q rend="inline">"left droſs to ducheſſes."</q> He
conſiders her happineſs as his main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and their example every
day gives freſh conviction to the father, that where two perſons of
ſtrong ſenſe and good hearts, conceive a reciprocal affection for each
other, their paſſion is genuine and laſting, and their union is perhaps
the trueſt ſtate of happineſs under the ſun.</p>

ſort of a little <hi>Cambridge</hi> Miſcellany. The reader will ſee, it
is compoſed of two little poems, which I have lately received from two
different correſpondents in that learned Univerſity. The Ode to Friendship
has, in my opinion, many beauties, and is infinitely ſuperior

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Remember a rector of a pariſh at the court end of the town,
who was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accounted a very fine preacher, that uſed to aim at
delivering himſelf in the moſt bold and animated ſtile of oratory. The
tone of his voice was nicely accommodated to the different branches of his
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and every thing was pronounced with uncommon energy and
emphaſis; he alſo indulged himſelf in equal freedom of action, and
abounded in various extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary geſticulations; his ſermons themſelves
were ſown thick with tropes, metaphors, and ſimilies, and every where
enriched with <hi>apoſtrophe</hi> and <hi>proſopopaeia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="758" facs="tcp:1252700302:333"/>AS I knew that this reverend gentleman had
been abroad with a young nobleman in the capacity of a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling tutor, I did
not wonder at the violent exertion of his voice, and the vehemence of his
action; as this is a piece of clerical foppery, which an itinerant clergyman is
apt to adopt, while his pupil is gleaning all the other follies of
<hi>Paris:</hi> at which place it is very common to ſee a <hi>capuchine</hi>
ſo heated with his ſubject, that he often ſeems in danger of throwing
himſelf out of the pulpit. But I was at a loſs how to account for the
glowing ſtile of his diſcourſes, till happening to turn over the works of
a celebrated <hi>French</hi> preacher, I found that the oratorical performances
of my friend were no other than faithful tranſlations of them.</p>
               <p>THIS ſort of pulpit plagiariſm may perhaps be more adapted
to the taſte of ſome of our faſhionable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers, than the more
hackneyed method of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a page from <hi>Barrow, Tillotſon,</hi>
or <hi>Atterbury:</hi> but although ſuch practices may be leſs liable to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, it is certainly more orthodox to rifle the works of our own
Divines, than to ranſack the treaſures of <hi>Romiſh</hi> prieſts; and
their inflamed orations are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly leſs adapted to the genius of our
people, than the ſober reaſonings of our own preachers. It muſt be owned
indeed that ſome of our clergy are greatly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that life and
ſpirit, which would render their inſtructions more affecting as well as
more pleaſing. Their ſermons are frequently drawn out in one continued
drawl, without any variation of voice or geſture: ſo that it is no wonder,
if ſome of the congregation ſhould be caught napping, when the preacher
himſelf hardly <pb n="759" facs="tcp:1252700302:334"/> ſeems to be awake. But though this
drowſy delivery is not to be commended, yet a ſerious earneſtneſs is
moſt likely to engage the attention, and convince the reaſon. This manner,
as it is moſt decent in itſelf, is beſt ſuited to an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
audience; though it is no wonder that a different ſtrain of oratory ſhould
prevail in <hi>France,</hi> ſince a <hi>Frenchman</hi> accompanies almoſt
every word in ordinary converſation with ſome fantaſtic geſture, and
even enquires concerning your health, and talks of the weather, with a
thouſand ſhrugs and grimaces.</p>
               <p>BUT though I do not like to ſee a preacher lazily lolling on
the cuſhion, or dozing over his ſermon-caſe, and haranguing his audience
with an unchriſtian apathy; yet even this unanimated delivery is perhaps
leſs offenſive, than to obſerve a clergyman leſs aſſiduous to
inſtruct his audience, than to be admired by them. A ſober divine ſhould
not aſcend the pulpit with the ſame paſſions that a public orator
mounts the <hi>roſtrum:</hi> much leſs ſhould he aſſume the voice,
geſture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of a player, and the language of the theatre. He
ſhould preſerve a temperance in the moſt earneſt parts of his
diſcourſe, and go through the whole of it in ſuch a manner, as beſt
agrees with the ſolemn place in which it is uttered. Pompous nonſenſe,
bellowed out with a thundering accent, comes with a worſe grace from the
pulpit, than bombaſt and ſuſtian injudiciouſly ranted forth by a 
<q rend="inline">"periwig-pated fellow"</q> on the ſtage. I
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better illuſtrate the abſurdity and indecency of this manner, than
by a familiar, though ſhameful, inſtance of it. Whoever has occaſionally
joined with the butchers in making up the audience of the <hi>Clare-Market</hi>
                  <pb n="760" facs="tcp:1252700302:335"/> Orator will agree with me, that the impropriety of his
ſtile and the extravagance of his action become ſtill more ſhocking and
intolerable by the day which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and the eccleſiaſtical
appearance of the place in which the declaimer harangues. Thus while thoſe
who thunder out damnation from pariſh pulpits, may, from aſſuming the
manners of the theatre, be reſembled to ranting players; the
<hi>Clare-Market</hi> Orator, while he turns religion into farce, muſt be
conſidered as exhibiting ſhews and interludes of an inferior nature, and
himſelf regarded as a Jack-pudding in a gown and caſſock.</p>
               <p>A BLOATED ſtile is perhaps of all others leaſt to be
commended. It is more frequently made a ſhelter for nonſenſe, than a
vehicle of truth: but though improper on all occaſions, it more especially
deviates from the chaſte plainneſs and ſimplicity of Pulpit Eloquence.
Nor am I leſs diſpleaſed with thoſe who are admired by ſome as
<hi>pretty</hi> preachers; as I think a clergyman may be a coxcomb in his
ſtile and manner, as well as a prig in his appearance. Flowers of rhetoric
injudiciouſly ſcattered over a ſermon are as diſguſting in his
diſcourſe, as the ſnug wig and ſcented white handkerchief in his
dreſs. The <hi>pretty</hi> preacher aims alſo at politeneſs and
good-breeding, takes the ladies to taſk in a genteel vein of raillery, and
handles their modiſh foibles with the ſame air that he gallants their fans:
but if he has a mind to put his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the ſtretch, and indulge
himſelf in a more than ordinary flow of rhetoric, he fritters away the
ſolemnity of ſome ſcriptural ſubject; and I have heard a flourishing
declaimer of this caſt take off from the awful idea of the Paſſion by
dwelling principally on the gracefulneſs of perſon, ſweetneſs of voice,
and elegance of deportment <pb n="761" facs="tcp:1252700302:336"/> in the Divine Sufferer; and
at another time in ſpeaking of the Fall, I have known him enter into a
pictureſque deſcription of the woods, groves, and rivulets, panſies,
pinks, and violets, that threw a perpetual gaiety over the face of nature in
the garden of <hi>Eden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFFECTED oratory and an extravagant delivery were firſt
practiſed by thoſe who vary from the regular eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church: nor
is there any manner ſo unbecoming and indecent, which has not at one time or
another been accounted truly ſpiritual and graceful. Snuffling through the
noſe with an harmonious twang has been regarded as a kind of church-muſic
beſt calculated to raiſe devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a piteous chorus of ſighs and
groans has been thought the moſt effectual call to repentance. Irregular
tremblings of the voice and contortions of the perſon have long been the
eloquence of Quakers and Preſbyterians; and are now the favourite mode of
preaching practiſed by thoſe ſelf-ordained teachers, who ſtrike out new
lights in religion, and pour forth their extempore rhapſodies in a torrent of
enthuſiaſtical oratory. An inſpired cobler will thunder out anathemas,
with the tone and geſture of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> from a joint-ſtool; and an
enlightened brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer will work himſelf up to ſuch a pitch of vehemence,
as ſhall make his audience quake again. I am ſorry to ſee our regular
divines rather copying than reforming this hot and extravagant manner of
preaching; and have with pain been witneſs to a wild intemperate delivery in
our pariſh-churches, which I ſhould only have expected at the chapel in
<hi>Long-Acre,</hi> or at the Foundery and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in
<hi>Moor-Fields.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="762" facs="tcp:1252700302:337"/>AS a ſerious earneſtneſs in the
delivery, and a nervous ſimplicity in the ſtile of a diſcourſe, are the
moſt becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ornaments of the pulpit, ſo an affectation of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is
no where ſo offenſive. The delivery of a preacher as well as his diction
ſhould, like his dreſs, be plain and decent. Inflamed eloquence and wild
geſtures are unſuitable to the place and his function; and though ſuch
vehement heat may perhaps kindle the zeal of a few enthuſiaſtic old beldams
in the iſle, it has a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effect on the more rational part of the
congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I would therefore recommend it to our faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able divines to
aim at being Preachers rather than Orators or Actors, and to endeavour to make
their diſcourſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like Sermons rather than Orations.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are told, that in <hi>Spain</hi> it is the cuſtom for
huſbands never to let their wives go abroad without a watchful old woman to
attend them; and in <hi>Turkey</hi> it is the faſhion to lock up their
miſtreſſes under the guard of a truſty eunuch: but I never knew, that
in any country the men were put under the ſame reſtrictions. Alas! Sir, my
wife is to me a very <hi>Duena;</hi> ſhe is as careful of me, as the
<hi>Keiſler Aga,</hi> or Chief Eunuch, is of the Grand Signior's favourite
Sultana: <pb n="764" facs="tcp:1252700302:339"/> and whether ſhe believes, that I am in love
with every woman, or that every woman is in love with me, ſhe will never
truſt me out of her ſight; but ſticks as cloſe to me, as if ſhe
really was, without a figure, bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh. I am
never ſuffered to ſtir abroad without her, leſt I ſhould go aſtray;
and at home ſhe follows me up and down the houſe like a child in
leading-ſtrings: nay, if I do but ſtep down ſtairs on any ordinary
occaſion, ſhe is ſo afraid I ſhall give her the ſlip, that ſhe
always ſcreams after me, 
<q rend="inline">"my dear, you are not going out;"</q> though
for better ſecurity ſhe generally locks up my hat and cane together with
her own gloves and cardinal, that one might not ſtir out without the
other.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT flatter myſelf, that I am handſomer or better
made than other men: nor has ſhe, in my eyes at leaſt, fewer charms than
other women. Need I add, that my complexion is not over-ſanguine, nor my
conſtitution very robuſt? Beſides, we have not been married above a
month. And yet ſhe is ſo very doubtful of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, that I cannot
ſpeak, or even pay the compliment of my hat, to any young lady, though in
public, without giving new alarms to her jealouſy. Such an one, ſhe is
ſure from her flaunting airs, is a kept madam; another is no better than
ſhe ſhould be; and ſhe ſaw another tip me the wink, or give me a nod,
as a mark of ſome private aſſignation between us. A nun, Sir, might as
ſoon force her way into a convent of monks, as any young woman get admittance
into our houſe: ſhe has therefore affronted all her acquaintance of her own
ſex, that are not, or might not have been, the grandmothers 
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:1252700302:340"/> of many generations; and is at home to nobody, but
maiden ladies in the bloom of threeſcore, and beauties of the laſt
century.</p>
                     <p>SHE will ſcarce allow me to mix even with perſons of my
own ſex; and ſhe looks upon batchelors in particular, as no better than
pimps and common ſeducers. One evening ſhe, indeed, vouchſafed to truſt
me out of doors at a tavern with ſome of my male-friends: but the firſt
bottle had ſcarce gone round, before word was brought up, that my boy was
come with the lanthorn to light me home. I ſent him back with orders to call
in an hour; when preſently after the maid was diſpatched, with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that
my dear was gone to bed very ill, and wanted me directly. I was preparing to
obey the ſummons; when to our great ſurprize the ſick lady herſelf
bolted into the room, complained of my cruel heart, and fell into a fit, from
which ſhe did not recover, till the coach had ſet us down at our own
houſe. She then called me the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of huſbands, and ſaid that all
taverns were no better than bawdy-houſes, and that men only went thither to
meet naughty women: at laſt ſhe declared it to be her firm reſolution,
that I ſhould never ſet my foot again in any one of them, except herſelf
be allowed to make one of the company.</p>
                     <p>YOU will ſuppoſe, Sir, that while my wife is thus cautious
that I ſhould not be led aſtray when abroad, ſhe takes particular care
that I ſhould not ſtumble on tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at home. For this reaſon, as
ſoon as I had brought her to my houſe, my two maid-ſervants were
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turned away at a moment's warning, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:1252700302:341"/> out many covert hints and ſome open accuſations of
too near an intimacy between us: though I proteſt to you one was a feeble old
wrinkled creature, as haggard and frightful as mother <hi>Shipton</hi>; and the
other, a ſtrapping wench, as coarſe and brawny as the Female
<hi>Samſon.</hi> Even my man <hi>John,</hi> who had lived in the family for
thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, was packed off, as being too well acquainted with his maſter's
ſly ways. A chair-woman was forced to do our work for ſome time, before
madam could ſuit herſelf with maids for her purpoſe. One was too pert an
huſſy; another went too fine; another was an impudent forward young
baggage. At preſent our houſehold is made up of ſuch beautiful
monſters, as <hi>Caliban</hi> himſelf might fall in love with: my lady's
own waiting-woman has a moſt inviting hump-back, and is ſo charmingly
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytic, that ſhe ſhakes all over like a <hi>Chineſe</hi> figure; the
houſe-maid ſquints moſt delightfully with one ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eye, which
weeps continually for the loſs of its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and the cook, beſides a
moſt captivating red face and protuberant waiſt, has a moſt graceful
hobble in her gait, occaſioned by one leg being ſhorter than the other.</p>
                     <p>I NEED not tell you, that I muſt never write a letter, but
madam muſt ſee the contents before it is done up; and that I never durſt
open one till ſhe has broke the ſeal, or read it till ſhe has firſt run
it over. Every rap from the poſt-man at the door makes her tremble; and I
have known her ready to burſt with ſpleen at ſeeing a ſuperſcription
written in a fair <hi>Italian</hi> hand, though perhaps it only comes from my
aunt in the country. She can pick out an intrigue even from the impreſſion
on the wax: and a cupid, or two hearts joined <pb n="767" facs="tcp:1252700302:342"/> in union,
or a wafer pricked with a pin, or ſtamped with a thimble, ſhe interprets as
the certain tokens of a billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doux. The other week I received a letter from
<hi>Derby-ſhire,</hi> which awakened all her miſtruſt. She knew from the
ſcrawl and ſtrange ſpelling on the outſide, that it muſt come from a
woman: ſhe therefore tore it open in a violent rage, in hopes of making a
moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial diſcovery; but to her great diſappointment the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
were perfectly illegible. She was now convinced that it came from ſome
naſty creature, whom I maintained in the country; and that we correſponded
together in cypher. I was obliged to confeſs the truth; that it was, indeed,
drawn up in cypher, and that I had the key to it. At length, with much ado, I
explained the whole matter to her; telling her, that it was a letter from my
farmer, who not having been bred at a writing-ſchool expreſſed his
meaning by characters of his own invention. However, this aſſurance did not
at all pacify her, till ſhe had diſpatched a truſty meſſenger to be
certified of the truth.</p>
                     <p>THIS loving creature happened to be taken ill lately, when
ſhe thought that ſhe was going to die. She called me to her bed-ſide, and
with tears in her eyes told me, that ſhe ſhould not be able to die in
peace, except I would promiſe her one thing. I aſſured her, I would
promiſe any thing to make her eaſy— 
<q rend="inline">"O my dear, ſays ſhe, I cannot bear the
thought of your being another's; and therefore I ſhall not reſt in my
grave, if you do not ſwear to me, that you will never marry again, or think
of another woman, as long as you <pb n="768" facs="tcp:1252700302:343"/> live."</q> My poor dear
is, however, recovered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting my faith to ſo hard a trial: though
I may venture to ſay, that I have already had ſo much of matrimony, I could
ſubmit to any conditions to part with her.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y wife is mad, ſtark mad; and unleſs you can preſcribe
ſome remedy for that ſtrange phrenzy that poſſeſſes her, my peace
of mind muſt be for ever broken, and my fortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably ruined. You
muſt know, ſir, that ſhe is afflicted with a diſorder exactly
oppoſite to the bite of a <hi>Tarantula:</hi> for as that is ſaid to admit
of no cure but muſic, there is not a note in the <hi>Gamut,</hi> but what
tends to heighten and inflame my wife's lunacy. I find it is the faſhion in
this age for ſingers and fidlers to publiſh Appeals to the public:
wherefore, as you have hitherto liſtened to the complaints of huſbands, I
muſt beg you now to conſider <pb n="770" facs="tcp:1252700302:345"/> mine, and to ſuffer
me alſo to Appeal to the public by means of your paper.</p>
                     <p>A FEW years ago buſineſs called me over to <hi>Italy</hi>;
where this unfortunate woman received the firſt, touches of this diſorder.
She ſoon conceived a violent paſſion for Taſte in general, which
ſettled at laſt in an unquenchable rage after muſical compoſitions.
Solos, Sonatas, Operas, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certos, became her ſole employment and
delight, and ſingers and muſicians her only company. At length full of
<hi>Italian</hi> airs ſhe returned to <hi>England,</hi> where alſo her
whole happineſs has been centered in the orcheſtra, and it has been her
whole pride to be thought a <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> in muſic. If there is an
opera, oratorio, or concert, to be performed within the bills of mortality, I
do not believe that the riches of the <hi>Indies</hi> could prevail on her to
be abſent. Two, and only two good conſequences attend this madneſs, and
thoſe are, that ſhe conſtantly attends St. <hi>James</hi>'s chapel for
the ſake of the anthem and the reſt of the muſic: and out of the many
pounds idly ſquandered on minums and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quavers, ſome few are dedicated
to charities, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by muſical performances.</p>
                     <p>BUT what makes this rage after catgut more irkſome and
intolerable to me is, that I have not myſelf the leaſt idea of what they
call Taſte, and it almoſt drives me mad to be peſtered with it. I am a
plain man, and have not the leaſt ſpice of a <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> in my
compoſition, yet nothing will ſatisfy my wife unleſs I appear as fond of
ſuch nonſenſe as herſelf. About a month ago ſhe prevailed on me to
attend her to the Opera, where every dying fall made her expire, as well as
Lady <hi>Townly.</hi> She was raviſhed with one air, in <pb n="771" facs="tcp:1252700302:346"/> extaſies at another, applauded <hi>Ricciarelli,</hi> encored
<hi>Mingotti,</hi> and in ſhort acted like an abſolute madwoman; while the
performance and her behaviour had a quite different effect upon me, who ſat
dumb with confuſion, 
<q rend="inline">"moſt muſical, moſt melancholy,"</q> at
her elbow. When we came home again, ſhe ſeemed as happy as harmony could
make her, but I muſt own, that I was all diſcord, and moſt heartily vexed
at being made a fool in public. 
<q rend="inline">"Well, my dear, ſaid ſhe, how do you like
the opera?"—</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Zouns, madam, I would as ſoon be dragged
through a horſepond, as go to an opera with you again."—</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"O fie! but you muſt be delighted with
<hi>The Mingotti.</hi>"—</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"The Mingotti! <hi>The Devil.</hi>"—</q>

                        <q rend="inline">"Well, I am ſorry for it, Sir
<hi>Aaron,</hi> but I find you have no Ear."—</q> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Ear, madam? I had rather cut off my ears,
than ſuffer them to make me an ideot."</q> To this ſhe made me no reply,
but began a favourite opera tune, and after taking a tour round the room like
one of the ſingers, left me alone.</p>
                     <p>IF my wife could be ſatisfied, like other muſical ladies,
with attending public performances, and now and then thrumming on her
harpſicord the tunes ſhe hears there; I ſhould be content. But ſhe has
alſo a concert of her own conſtantly once a week. Here ſhe is in ſtill
greater raptures than at the opera, as all the muſic is choſen and
appointed by herſelf. The expence of this whim is monſtrous, for not one of
theſe people will open their mouths, or roſin a ſingle ſtring, without
being very well paid for it. Then ſhe muſt have all the beſt hands and
voices, and has almoſt as large a ſet of performers in pay as the manager
of the opera. It puts me quite out of patience to ſee theſe fellows
ſtrutting about my houſe dreſt up like lords and gentlemen. Not a 
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:1252700302:347"/> ſingle fiddler or ſinger but what appears in lace or
embroidery, and I once miſtook my wife's chief muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian for a foreign
ambaſſador.</p>
                     <p>IT is impoſſible to recount the numberleſs follies to
which this ridiculous paſſion for Muſic expoſes her. Her devotion to
the art, makes her almoſt adore the profeſſors of it. A muſician is a
greater man in her eye than a duke, and ſhe would ſooner oblige an
opera-ſinger than a counteſs. She is as buſy in promoting their benefits
as if ſhe was to have the receipts of the houſe; and quarrels with all her
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who will not permit her to load them with tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. Every fidler
in town makes it his buſineſs to ſcrape an acquaintance with her, and an
<hi>Italian</hi> is no ſooner imported than ſhe becomes a part of my wife's
band of performers. In the late Opera diſputes ſhe has been a moſt
furious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, and it is impoſſible for any patriot to feel more
anxiety for the danger of <hi>Blakeney</hi> and <hi>Minorca,</hi> than ſhe
has ſuffered on account of the Opera, and the loſs of
<hi>Mingotti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I DO not believe my wife has a ſingle idea except
recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, airs, counter-tenor, thorough-baſs, &amp;c. which are
perpetually ſinging in her head. When we ſit together, inſtead of joining
in any agreeable converſation, ſhe is always either humming a tune, or 
<q rend="inline">"diſcourſing moſt eloquent muſic."</q>
Nature has denied her a voice, but as <hi>Italy</hi> has given her Taſte and
a graceful manner, ſhe is continually ſqueaking out ſtrains leſs
melodious, than the harmony of ballad-ſinging in our ſtreets, or
pſalm-ſinging in a country church. To make her ſtill more ridiculous,
ſhe learns to play on that maſculine inſtrument the baſs-viol; the
pleaſure of which nothing can prevail on her to forego, as the 
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:1252700302:348"/> baſs-viol, ſhe daily tells me, contains the whole
power and very ſoul of harmony.</p>
                     <p>WHAT method, Mr. TOWN, ſhall I perſue to cure my wife of
this muſical phrenzy? I have ſome thoughts of holding weekly a burleſque
<hi>Rorotorio,</hi> compoſed of mock-airs with grand accompanyments of the
Jew's Harp, Wooden Spoons, and Marrowbones and Cleavers on the ſame day with
my wife's concert; and have actually ſent to two of Mrs. <hi>Midnight</hi>'s
hands to teach me the art and myſtery of playing on the Broomſtick and
Hurdy-Gurdy, at the ſame time that my wife learns on the baſs-viol. I have
alſo a ſtrong rough voice, which will enable me to roar out <hi>Bumper</hi>
Squire Jones, <hi>Roaſt Beef,</hi> or ſome other old <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ballad, whenever ſhe begins to trill forth her melodious airs in
<hi>Italian.</hi> If this has no effect, I will learn to beat the drum, or wind
the poſt-horn: and if I ſhould ſtill find it impoſſible for noiſe
and clamour to overcome the ſound of her voices and inſtruments, I have
half-reſolved peremptorily to ſhut my doors againſt ſingers and
fidlers, and even to demoliſh her harpſichord and baſs-viol.</p>
                     <p>BUT this, alas! is coming to extremities, which I am almoſt
afraid to venture, and would endeavour to avoid. I have no averſion to
muſic, but I would not be a fidler: nor do I diſlike company, but I would
as ſoon keep an inn, as convert my houſe into a theatre for all the idle
things of both ſexes to aſſemble at. But my wife's affections are ſo
wedded to the <hi>Gamut,</hi> that I cannot deviſe any means to wean her from
this folly. If I could make her fond of dreſs, or teach her to love cards,
plays, or any thing but muſic I ſhould be happy. This method of
deſtroying <pb n="774" facs="tcp:1252700302:349"/> my peace with harmony, is no better than
tickling me to death; and to ſquander away ſuch ſums of money on a parcel
of bawling ſcraping raſcals in laced coats and bag-wigs, is abſolutely
giving away my eſtate for an old ſong. You, Mr. TOWN, are a profeſſed
<hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> therefore either give me a little Taſte, or teach
my wife to abandon it: for at preſent we are but a jangling pair, and there
is not the leaſt harmony between us, though, like baſs and treble, we are
obliged to join in concert.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM a rich old bachelor, and like other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient gentlemen
of that order, and very fond of being indulged in all my odd humours, and
always having my own way. This is one reaſon I never married, for if my wife
had been a ſhrewiſh termagant, ſhe would have killed me, and if ſhe had
been a tame domeſtic animal I ſhould have killed her: but the way of life I
have now fallen into is of all others the beſt calculated to gratify my
fantaſtical temper. I have no near relation indeed to treat as an humble
couſin all my life, in hopes of being happy at my death; yet I abound in
ſycophants and followers, all whom I delude, <pb n="776" facs="tcp:1252700302:351"/> like
another <hi>Volpone,</hi> with the expectations of being made my heir. The
abject ſpirit of theſe wretches flatters me, and amuſes me. I am indolent
and hate contradiction, and can ſafely ſay that not one of my acquaintance
has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted me for theſe ſeven years. There is not one of them but
would be glad if I would ſpit in his face, or rejoice at a kick of the breech
from me, if they thought I meant it as a token of my familiarity. When I am
grave, they appear as dull as mutes at a funeral; when I ſmile, they grin
like monkies; when I tell a ſilly ſtory, they chuckle over every ridiculous
particular, and ſhake their ſides in admiration of my wit. Sometimes I
pretend to be ſhort-ſighted, and then not one of them ſees farther than
his noſe. They ſwallow ſour wine, eat muſty victuals, and are proud to
ride in my old boots.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE been told of a certain prelate, who brought his
chaplains to ſuch a degree of ſervility, that after every deal at whiſt,
they would aſk him, what he would chuſe to have for trumps next deal? I
keep my fellows in equal good order. They all think me a cloſe old hunks, and
imagining that winning their money will put me in good humour with them, they
practice all the arts of ſharping to cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I have known them
pack the cards at Whiſt, that I might hold all the four honours in my own
hand; they will load the dice in my favour at Hazard; pocket themſelves on
purpoſe at Billiards; and at Bowls if any one is near win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the game, he
never fails in the next caſt to miſtake his biaſs. It is impoſſible
for the moſt deſpotic monarch to be more abſolute over his ſubjects,
than I am over theſe ſlaves and ſycophants. Yet in ſpite of all their
endeavours to oblige me, I moſt heartily deſpiſe them, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready 
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:1252700302:352"/> drawn up a will, in which I have bequeathed to each of
them a ſhilling and a dog-collar.</p>
                     <p>BUT though I have ſettled in my mind what legacies I ſhall
leave them, I have not thoroughly reſolved in what manner I ſhall
diſpoſe of the bulk of my eſtate. Indeed I am fully determined, like
moſt other wealthy bachelors, either to leave my fortune to ſome
oſtentatious pious uſes, or to perſons, whom I have never ſeen, and for
whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters I have not the leaſt regard or eſteem. To ſpeak
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, oſtentation carries away my whole heart: but then it is a
little difficult to find out a new object to indulge my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whilſt I am
on this ſide the grave; by ſecuring to me a certain proſpect of
poſthumous fame, which is always ſo agreeable to living pride.</p>
                     <p>THE hoſpitals are ſo numerous that my name will be loſt
among thoſe more known and eſtabliſhed of <hi>Guy, Morden, Bancroft,</hi>
and I know not who. Beſides in the ſpace of four or five centuries perhaps
it may be thought, notwithſtanding my whole length picture and ſtatue, that
I had aſſiſtance from parliament. If I order my money to be laid out in
churches, they will never be built. If in temple, gardens, lakes, obeliſks,
and ſerpentine rivers; the next generation of the ſons of Taſte will
demoliſh all my works, turn my rounds into ſquares, and my ſquares into
rounds, and not leave even my buſt, although it were caſt a plaiſter of
<hi>Paris</hi> by Mr. <hi>Racſtrow,</hi> or worked up in wax by Mr.
<hi>Goupy.</hi> Or ſuppoſing in imitation of ſome of my predeceſſors,
I were to bequeath my fortune to my houſekeeper, and recommend her in my will
as a pattern of virtue, diligence, and every good quality, what will be the
effect? In three weeks <pb n="778" facs="tcp:1252700302:353"/> after my death ſhe will marry
an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> and I ſhall not even enjoy my monument and marble
perriwig in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NOTHING perplexes me ſo much as the diſpoſal of my money
by my laſt will and teſtament. While I am living, it procures the moſt
ſervile compliance with all my whims from my ſycophants, and ſeveral
other conveniences: but I would fain buy fame with it after my death. Do but
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me, how I may lay it out in the moſt valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of
this ſort, only diſcover ſome new object of charity, and perhaps I may
bequeath you a round ſum of money for your advice.</p>

               <p>IT is ſaid by an old poet, that no man's life can be called
happy or unhappy till his death: in like manner I have often thought that no
words or actions are a better comment on a perſon's temper and
diſpoſition, than his laſt will and teſtament. This is a true
portraiture of himſelf drawn at full length by his own hand, in which the
painting is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very lively, and the features very ſtrongly marked. In
the diſcharge of this ſolemn act, people ſign and ſeal themſelves,
either wiſe and good characters, or villains and ſools: and any perſon
that makes a ridiculous will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths his money to frivolous uſes,
only takes a great deal of pains, like <hi>Dogberry</hi> in the play, 
<q rend="inline">"that he may be ſet down and aſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="779" facs="tcp:1252700302:354"/>THE love of fame governs our actions more
univerſally than any other paſſion. All the reſt gradually drop off,
but this runs through our whole lives. This perhaps is one of the chief
inducements that influences wealthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to bequeath their
poſſeſſions to oſtentatious uſes, and they would as willingly lay
out a conſiderable ſum in buying a great name (if poſſible) at their
deaths, as they would beſtow it on the purchaſe of a coat of heraldry
during their lives. They are pleaſed with leaving ſome memorial of their
exiſtence behind them, and to perpetuate the remembrance of themſelves by
the application of their money of ſome vain-glorious purpoſes; though the
good gentlemen never did one act to make themſelves remarkable, laid out a
ſingle ſhilling in a laudable manner, while they lived. If an
<hi>Apotheoſis</hi> were to be bought, how many rich ſcoundrels would be
deified after their deaths! not a plumb in the city but would purchaſe this
imaginary godſhip, as readily as he paid for his freedom at his firſt
ſetting up; and I doubt not but this fantaſtical diſtinction would be
more frequent on an eſcutcheon, than a coronet.</p>
               <p>THE diſpoſal of our fortunes by our laſt will ſhould be
conſidered as the diſcharge of a ſacred truſt, which we ſhould
endeavour to execute in a juſt manner; and as we have had the enjoyment of
rich poſſeſſions, we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to provide that they may devolve
to thoſe, who have the moſt natural claim to them. They who may firſt
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our favour, are thoſe who are allied to us by the ties of blood: next
to theſe ſtand thoſe perſons to whom we are connected by friendſhip:
and next to our friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mankind in general. But the humanity of

<pb n="780" facs="tcp:1252700302:355"/> to poſterity, or includes the poor in general, if it
neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the objects of charity immediately under his eye, or thoſe
individuals who have the beſt title to his benevolence. <hi>Virgil</hi> has
placed thoſe rich men, who beſtowed none of their wealth on their
relations, among the chief perſonages in his Hell. Wherefore I would adviſe
my good correſpondent Mr. <hi>Vainall</hi> firſt to conſider, whether he
has not ſome poor relation, ſtarving perhaps in ſome diſtant part of
the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: after that let him look round, whether he has not ſome friends,
whom he may poſſibly relieve from miſery and diſtreſs. But if he has
no relation, nor no perſon in the world that has any regard for him, before
he begins to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow a college or found an hoſpital, I ſhould take it as a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favour if he would leave his money to me, and will promiſe to
immortalize his memory in the <hi>Connoiſſeur.</hi>

almoſt ſaid inſenſible) huſband, who in your paper of the eighth

                     <p>I CONFESS and glory in my paſſion for muſic: and can
there be a nobler or a more generous one? My nerves are naturally ſtrung to
harmony, and variouſly affected by the various combinations of the
<hi>Gamut.</hi> Some ſtay in <hi>Italy</hi> added ſkill and taſte in

ſure with truth aſſert, that whether in the <hi>allegro</hi> or the

he never had his equal. O, Mr. TOWN, what an irretrievable loſs has this
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſuſtained! My good man, among his other qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, is a
politician, you muſt know; and one of his principal objections againſt
theſe <hi>virtuoſi</hi> is, that they are foreigners. He flew into a
violent paſſion with me laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> night, becauſe I had a
concert at my houſe, when (he ſaid) ſuch bad news were received from
abroad. I know not what he, and other muddy-headed politicians may think: but
let him talk what he will of THE <hi>Blakeney,</hi> THE Governor, THE Admiral,
I am ſure the nation cannot ſuſtain a greater evil than the loſs of THE
<hi>Mingotti;</hi> who, as the public prints will inform you, 
<q rend="inline">"is gone to <hi>Holland,</hi> till her affairs
in <hi>England</hi> can be ſettled."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT however gothic my huſband may be, I am fully determined
to diſcharge the duty of a good wife. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, whenever he comes into my
room, I ſit down to my harpſichord, and ſing and play the moſt
ſoothing pieces of muſic, in hopes ſome time or other of hitting his
uniſon, but hitherto to no purpoſe; and, to ſay the truth, I fear he has
not one harmonic nerve in his whole ſyſtem, though otherwiſe a man of
good plain ſenſe. When he interrupts my performances, (as in his letter he
owns that he does) with wiſhing for the men from <pb n="784" facs="tcp:1252700302:359"/>
                        <hi>Mother Midnight's,</hi> with their wooden ſpoons, ſalt-boxes,
jews-harps, and broom-ſticks, to play in concert with me; I anſwer him with
all gentleneſs and calmneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.— 
<q rend="inline">"Indeed, my dear, you have not the leaſt
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things. It would be impoſſible to bring thoſe
ridiculous inſtruments into a concert, and to adapt a thorough baſs to
them: they have not above three notes at moſt, and thoſe cannot be
<hi>ſoftenute.</hi>"</q>—I wiſh 
<q rend="inline">"for all that, anſwers he, that they were
here; I ſhould like them better than all your <hi>Signors</hi> and
<hi>Signoras</hi>; and I am ſure they would coſt a great deal
leſs."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS article of <hi>expence</hi> he often dwells upon, and
ſometimes even with warmth; to which I reply with all the mildneſs that
becomes a good wife, 
<q rend="inline">"My dear, you have a good fortune of your own,
and I brought you ſtill a better. Of what uſe is money, if not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed?
and how can it be better employed, than in encouraging and rewarding
diſtinguiſhed <hi>guſto</hi> and merit? Theſe people, that you call
ballad-ſingers and pipers, are people of birth, though for the moſt part of
ſmall fortunes; and they are much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as you know, in
<hi>Italy,</hi> than all the greateſt antient <hi>Roman</hi> heroes, if
revived, would now be. Many of them, who would perhaps make a figure in the
church or the ſtate, have been conſiderable loſers by devoting
themſelves to the pleaſures of mankind. They leave their own country, where
they are infinitely eſteemed for their moral as well as their muſical
characters, and generouſly ſacrifice all <pb n="785" facs="tcp:1252700302:360"/> theſe
advantages to our diverſion. Beſides, my dear, what ſhould we do wiſh
our money? would you laviſh it away, upon foundling baſtards, lying-in
women who have either no huſbands or too many, importunate beggars, all
whoſe cries and complaints are the moſt ſhocking diſcords? or
ſuppoſe that we were to ſave our money, and leave our children better
fortunes, who knows but they might, as too many do, ſquander them away idly?
whereas what we give to theſe <hi>virtuoſi,</hi> we know is given to merit.
For my own part, my dear, I have infinite pleaſure, when I can get any of
them to accept of fifty or an hundred guineas, which by the way cannot always
be brought about without ſome art and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; for they are moſt
exceedingly nice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate upon the point of honour, eſpecially in the
article of money. And I look upon ſuch trifling preſents as a debt due to
ſuperior talents and merit; and I endeavour to inſinuate them in a way that
the receiver may not bluſh."</q> —Here my huſband breaks out into a
violent paſſion, and ſays,— 
<q rend="inline">"Oons, madam, ſhow me a <hi>virtuoſo</hi>
or a <hi>virtuoſa,</hi> (as you call them) who ever bluſhed in their lives,
and I will give them the fee ſimple of my eſtate."</q> You ſee, Mr. TOWN,
what a ſtrange man he is, that he has no idea of elegance and
<hi>divertimenti,</hi> and when he is ſo violently in <hi>alt,</hi> I will
leave you to judge who it is that is mad, ſtark mad.</p>
                     <p>IN ſhort, ſir, my huſband is inſenſible, untuneable,
to the moſt noble, generous, and ſtrongeſt of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

paſſion alone engroſſes the whole ſoul, and leaves no room for
leſſer and vulgar cares; for you muſt certainly have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Mr.

is fit for no one other thing. Thus truly informed of my caſe, I am ſure

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O other diſpoſition or turn of mind ſo totally unfits a
man for all the ſocial offices of life as Indolence. An idle man is a mere
blank in the creation, he ſeems made for no end, and lives to no purpoſe.
He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not engage himſelf in any employment or profeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he
will never have diligence enough to follow it; he can ſucceed in no
undertaking, for he will never perſue it; he muſt be a bad huſband,
father, and relation, for he will not take the leaſt pains to preſerve his
wife, children, and family from ſtarving; and he muſt be a worthleſs
friend, for he would not draw his hand from his boſom, though to 
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:1252700302:363"/> prevent the deſtruction of the univerſe. If he is
born poor, he will remain ſo all his life, which he will probably end in a
ditch or at the gallows; if he embarks in trade he will be a bankrupt; and if
he is a perſon of fortune, he ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards will acquire immenſe eſtates,
and he himſelf perhaps will die in the <hi>Fleet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſhould be conſidered that nature did not bring us into
the world in a ſtate of perfection, but has left us in a capacity of
improvement: which ſhould ſeem to intimate that we ſhould labour to
render ourſelves excellent. Very few are ſuch abſolute ideots, as not to
be able to become at leaſt decent, if not eminent, in their ſeveral
ſtations, by unwearied and keen application: nor are there any poſſeſt
of ſuch tranſcendant genius and abilities, as to render all pains and
diligence unneceſſary. Perſeverance will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come difficulties, which at
firſt appear inſuperable; and it is amazing to conſider, how great and
numerous obſtacles may be removed by a continual attention to any particular
point. I will not mention here the trite example of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi>
who got over the greateſt natural impediments to oratory, but content
myſelf with a more modern and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar inſtance. Being at <hi>Sadler's
Wells</hi> a few nights ago, I could not but admire the ſurprizing feats of
activity there exhibited, and at the ſame time reflected what incredible
pains and labour it muſt have coſt the performers, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the art of
writhing their bodies into ſuch various and unnatural contortions. But I was
moſt taken with the ingenious artiſt, who after fixing two bells to each
foot, the ſame number to each hand, and with great propriety placing a cap
and bells on his head, played ſeveral tunes, and went through as regular
triple peals <pb n="789" facs="tcp:1252700302:364"/> and <hi>Bob Majors</hi> as the boys at
<hi>Chriſt Church</hi> Hoſpital; all which he effected by the due jerking
of his arms and legs, and nodding his head backward and forward. If this
artiſt had taken equal pains to employ his head in another way, he might
perhaps have been as deep a proficient in numbers as <hi>Jedediah Buxton,</hi>
or at leaſt a tolerable modern rhimer, of which he is now no bad emblem: and
if our fine ladies would uſe equal diligence, they might faſhion their
minds as ſucceſsfully as Madam <hi>Catharina</hi> diſtorts her body.</p>
               <p>THERE is not in the world a more uſeleſs idle animal, than
he who contents himſelf with being merely a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. He has an eſtate,
therefore he will not endeavour to acquire knowledge: he is not to labour in
any vocation, therefore he will do nothing. But the misfortune is that there is
no ſuch thing in nature as negative virtue, and that abſolute idleneſs is
impracticable. He who does no good, will certainly do miſchief; and the mind,
if it is not ſtored with uſeful knowledge, will neceſſarily become a
magazine of nonſenſe and trifles. Wherefore a Gentleman, though he is not
obliged to riſe to open his ſhop or work at his trade, may always find
ſome ways of employing his time to advantage. If he makes no advances in
wiſdom, he will become more and more a ſlave to folly; and he that does
nothing becauſe he has nothing to do, will become vicious and abandoned, or
at beſt ridiculous and contemptible.</p>
               <p>THERE is not a more melancholy object, than a man of an honeſt
heart and fine natural abilities whoſe good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are thus deſtroyed
by Indolence. Such a perſon is a conſtant plague to all his friends and
acquaintance, with all the means in his power of adding to their happineſs;
and <pb n="790" facs="tcp:1252700302:365"/> ſuffers himſelf to rank among the loweſt
characters, when he might render himſelf conſpicuous among the higheſt.
Nobody is more univerſally beloved, and more univerſally avoided than my
friend <hi>Careleſs.</hi> He is a humane man, who never did a beneficent
action; and a man of unſhaken integrity, on whom it is impoſſible to
depend. With the beſt head, and the beſt heart, he regulates his conduct in
the moſt abſurd manner, and frequently injures his friends; for whoever
neglects to do juſtice to himſelf, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably wrong thoſe with
whom he is connected; and it is by no means a true maxim, that an idle man
hurts nobody but himſelf.</p>
               <p>VIRTUE then is not to be conſidered in the light of mere
innocence, or abſtaining from harm, but as the exertion of our faculties in
doing good: as <hi>Titus,</hi> when he had let a day ſlip,
undiſtinguiſhed by ſome act of virtue, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"I have loſt a day."</q> If we regard our time
in this light, how many days ſhall we look back upon as irretrievably loſt?
and to how narrow a compaſs would ſuch a method of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation frequently
reduce the longeſt life? If we were to number our days, according as we have
applied them to virtue, it would occaſion ſtrange revolutions in the manner
of reckoning the ages of men. We ſhould ſee ſome few men arrived to a
good old age in the prime of their youth, and meet with ſeveral young fellows
of fourſcore.</p>
               <p>AGREEABLE to this way of thinking, I remember to have met with
the epitaph of an aged man, four years old: dating his exiſtence, from the
time of his reformation from evil courſes. The inſcriptions on moſt
tomb-ſtones commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate no acts of virtue performed by the perſons who lie
under <pb n="791" facs="tcp:1252700302:366"/> them, but only record that they were born one day
and died another. But I would fain have thoſe people, whoſe lives have been
uſeleſs, rendered of ſome ſervice after their deaths, by affording
leſſons of inſtruction and morality to thoſe they leave behind them.
Wherefore I could wiſh, that in every pariſh ſeveral acres were marked
out for a new and ſpacious Burying-Ground: in which every perſon, whoſe
remains are there depoſited, ſhould have a ſmall ſtone laid over them,
reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their age according to the manner in which they have improved or
abuſed the time allotted them in their lives. In ſuch circumſtances, the
plate on a coffin might be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt panegyric which the deceaſed could
receive; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſquare ſtone, inſcribed with <hi>Ob. Ann.
Aetat.</hi> 80. would be a nobler eulogium than all the lapidary adulation of
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern epitaphs. In a Burying-Ground of this nature, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the
partiality of ſurvivors, which would certainly point out the moſt brilliant
actions of their dead friends, we might perhaps ſee ſome inſcriptions,
not much unlike the following.</p>
               <q>Here lie the remains of a celebrated Beauty, aged 50, who died
in the fifth year of her age. She was born in her eighteenth year, and was
untimely killed by the ſmall pox in her twenty third.</q>
               <q> Here reſts in eternal ſleep the mortal part of L.
<hi>B.</hi> a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinker, aged 88, an Infant. He came into the world by
chance in the year — and was <hi>annihilated</hi> in the firſt year of
his age.</q>
               <q> Here continue to rot the bones of a noted Buck, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, who
never ſhewed any ſigns of life, and after twenty <pb n="792" facs="tcp:1252700302:367"/>
three years was ſo totally putrified, that it could not be kept above ground
any longer.</q>
               <q> Here lies the ſwoln carcaſe of a Boon Companion, who was
born in a dropſy in the 40th year of his age: He lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in this condition,
till he was obliged to be tapped, when he relapſed into his former condition,
and died in the ſecond year of his age, and the 23d of his drinking.</q>
               <q> Here lies <hi>Iſaac Da-Coſta,</hi> a convert from
Judaiſm, aged 64. He was born and chriſtened in his 61ſt year, and died
in the true Faith in the third year of his age.</q>
               <q> Here is depoſited the body of the celebrated Beau
<hi>Tawdry,</hi> who was born at court in the year — on a
<hi>Birthnight,</hi> and died of grief in his ſecond year upon the court's
going into mourning.</q>
               <q> Here rots A. <hi>B. Still</hi>-born, who died of a fright on
the twentieth of May, 1756.</q>
               <q> Here reſts from his labours the Brave General <hi>B.</hi> who

He that ſinks to a familiarity with perſons much below his own level, will
be conſtantly weighed down by his baſe connections: and though he may
eaſily plunge ſtill lower, he will find it impoſſible ever to riſe
again. We cannot give a liberal <pb n="794" facs="tcp:1252700302:369"/> turn of mind to a vulgar

               <p>BY Low Company I would not be ſuppoſed to mean the beſt

<q rend="inline">"that he ſhould be forced to drop his
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, becauſe he kept ſuch low company."</q> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I
confine this appellation ſolely to the inferior order of tradeſmen and
mechanics, or the whole body of the mobility in general: for although this rank
of people may be literally ſaid to be in low life, a right honourable, who
lets himſelf down to the manners of a porter or a hackney-coachman, differs
from them in nothing but his title.</p>
               <p>A PROPENSITY to Low Company is either owing to an original
meanneſs of ſpirit, a want of education, or <pb n="795" facs="tcp:1252700302:370"/> an
ill-placed pride, commonly ariſing from both the fore-mentioned cauſes.
Thoſe, who are naturally of a grovelling diſpoſition, ſhew it even at
ſchool, by chuſing their play-mates from the ſcum of the claſs; and are
never ſo happy, as when they can ſteal down to romp with the ſervants in
the kitchen. But the moſt frequent cauſe is the deſire of being, as it is
called, the head of the company; and a perſon of this humble ambition will be
very well content to pay the reckoning, for the honour of being
diſtinguiſhed by the title of The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. It ſometimes happens, that
a man of genius and learning will ſtoop to receive the incenſe of mean and
illiterate flatterers in a porter-houſe or a cyder-cellar: and I remember to
have heard of a poet, who was once caught in a bawdy-houſe in the very fact,
of reading his verſes to the good old mother and a circle of her
daughters.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome, who have been led into Low Company, merely
from an affectation of Humour; and from a notion of ſeeing life, and a
deſire of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted men of humour, have deſcended to aſſociate
with the meaneſt of the mob, and picked their cronies from
<hi>White-Chapel</hi> and <hi>Broad St. Giles</hi>'s. Of theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
the moſt remarkable is a young fellow of family and fortune, who was born and
bred a gentleman, but has taken great pains to degrade himſelf; and is now as
complete a blackguard as thoſe whom he has choſen for his companions. He
will drink purl in a <pb n="796" facs="tcp:1252700302:371"/> morning, ſmoke his pipe in a
night-cellar, and eat black puddings at <hi>Bartholomew Fair,</hi> for the
Humour of the thing. All the while, he is reckoned by his friends to be a
mighty good-natured gentleman, and without the leaſt bit of pride in him.</p>
               <p>IN order to qualify himſelf for the ſociety of the vulgar,
<hi>Bob</hi> has ſtudied and practiſed all the vulgar arts under the beſt
maſters. He has therefore cultivated an intimacy with <hi>Buckhorſe,</hi>
and is very proud of being ſometimes admitted to the honour of converſing
with the great <hi>Broughton</hi> himſelf. He is alſo very well known among
the hackney-coachmen, as a brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whip: but his greateſt excellence is
cricket-playing, in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the
<hi>Bennets</hi>; and is at length arrived at the ſupreme dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being
diſtinguiſhed among his brethren of the wicket by the title of <hi>Long
Robin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is diverting enough to conſider the fate of many of
<hi>Bob</hi>'s intimate friends and acquaintance. It muſt be owned, that
ſome of theſe have come to an untimely end; that ſome have been ſent
abroad, and others been ſet in the pillory, or whipt in <hi>Bridewell.</hi>
One of <hi>Bob</hi>'s favourite amuſements is attending the executions at
<hi>Tyburn:</hi> and it once happened, that one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions was
unfortunately brought thither; when <hi>Bob</hi> carried his regard for his
deceaſed friend ſo far, as to <pb n="797" facs="tcp:1252700302:372"/> get himſelf knocked
down in endeavouring to reſcue the body from the ſurgeons.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Bob</hi> conſtantly affects to mimic the air and
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the vulgar, he takes care to enrich his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the
emphatical oaths and expreſſive dialect of <hi>Billingſgate</hi> and
<hi>St. Giles</hi>'s; which never fails to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him as a man of excellent
humour among the <hi>Choice Spirits</hi> and the <hi>Sons of ſound ſenſe
and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> and frequently promotes him to the chair in theſe
facetious ſocieties. But he is particularly famous for ſinging thoſe
<hi>Cant Songs,</hi> drawn up in the lingo of ſharpers and pick-pockets; the
humour of which he greatly ſets off and heightens, by ſcrewing up his
mouth, and rolling about a large quid of tobacco be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his jaws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BOB</hi> has indulged the ſame notions of humour even in
his amours: and he is well known to every ſtreet-walker between
<hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> and <hi>Cheap-Side.</hi> This has ruined his
conſtitution, and often involved him in ſeveral unluckly ſcrapes. He has
been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bruiſed, beat, and kicked by the bullies in
<hi>Fleet-Ditch</hi> and <hi>Blood-Bowl Alley</hi>; and he was once ſoundly
drubbed by a ſoldier for engaging with his trull in St. <hi>James</hi>'s
Park. The laſt time I ſaw him, he was laid up with two black eyes, and a
broken pate, which he got in a midnight ſkirmiſh about a miſtreſs in a
night-cellar. He had carried down a <pb n="798" facs="tcp:1252700302:373"/> bunter which he had
picked up in the ſtreets, in order to treat her with a quartern of gin royal;
when a ſturdy chairman attempting to take away his doxy, a battle enſued
between them, and he was ſeverely handled, amid the univerſal cry of the
whole company, of—kick him <hi>up</hi> ſtairs—kick him
<hi>up</hi> ſtairs.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we look into the ſeveral inns of court, the profeſt
ſtudents of the law compoſe a very numerous body: but if we afterwards turn
our eyes on thoſe few, who are employed in exerciſing their talents in
<hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> this prodigious army of lawyers ſhrinks to a
very thin and inconſiderable corps. Thouſands, it ſeems, are
diſguſted with the unpleaſing dryneſs of the ſtudy, as it is now
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and conceive an unconquerable averſion to the white 
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:1252700302:375"/> leaves and the old black letter. This early diſlike to
legal enquiries certainly proceeds from the fatal miſtakes in the plan of
ſtudy hitherto marked out. According to all ſyſtems now extant, it is
abſolutely impoſſible to be at once a lawyer and a fine gentleman. Seeing
with concern the many evils ariſing from theſe erroneous principles, I have
at length deviſed a method to remedy all theſe inconveniences; a method,
now very ſucceſsfully practiſed by ſeveral young gentlemen. Wherefore I
muſt beg leave to ſubmit my thoughts to the public by means of your paper,
and to chalk out the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of a treatiſe, now ready for the preſs,
intitled <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Barriſter,</hi> or, <hi>a New Inſtitute of the
Laws of England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MY Lord <hi>Coke</hi> preſcribes to our ſtudent to follow
the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given in the ancient verſes, prefixed to this letter, for the
good ſpending of the day. 
<q rend="inline">"Six hours to ſleep, ſix to the ſtudy of
the law, four to prayer, two to meals, and the reſt to the Muſes."</q> But
what an abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable diſtribution of the four and twenty
hours! I will venture a thouſand pounds to a ſhilling, that not one
ſtudent in the kingdom divides his time in this manner. Here is not a
ſingle word of <hi>Vauxhall, Ranelagh,</hi> the theatres, or other public
diverſions; not to mention that nobody but a methodiſt would ever think of
praying four hours, and that it would be impoſſible, though we were content
with ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up a chop every day at <hi>Betty</hi>'s, to diſpatch even
dinner in two. How then ſhall we reconcile theſe precepts, ſcarce
practicable by a hermit, to the life of a young gentleman who keeps the beſt
company? Or how can theſe rules for ſevere application be made
conſiſtent with the practice of thoſe, who divide their whole time
between eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſleeping, and amuſements? Well knowing that the 
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:1252700302:376"/> volatile diſpoſitions of the young gentlemen of the
preſent age can never ſubmit the ordering of their lives to any
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed rules, I have endeavoured to ſquare my precepts to their lives;
and have ſo contrived the matter, that amidſt the keeneſt perſuit of
their pleaſures, they ſhall be engaged in the moſt improving courſe of
the law.</p>
                     <p>AS laws are chiefly nothing elſe but rules of action, what
can be more cruel and abſurd, than to coop up a briſk young man to learn in
his chambers, what he can ſo much better teach himſelf by going abroad into
the world? I propoſe to doſe gentlemen with ſtudy, as Dr. <hi>Rock</hi>
does with phyſic, to be taken at home or abroad without loſs of time or
hindrance of buſineſs. This, I am convinced, is not only the beſt
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but alſo the only ſcheme which ſeveral inhabitants of the inns
of court would ever follow. I ſhall not at preſent foreſtall the contents
of my treatiſe by preſenting you with a dry abſtract of it, but rather
endeavour to give you an idea of the ſpirit and manner in which it is
written, by delineating the plan diligently perſued by one of my favourite
pupils: and I cannot but congratulate the bar, that ſo many young men,
inſtead of blinding their eyes and bewildering their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings with
<hi>Coke, Plowden, Salkeld,</hi> &amp;c. have ſenſe enough to follow the
ſame courſe of ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>TOM RIOT, the principal ornament of my claſs of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
was ſent to the <hi>Temple,</hi> not with any intention that he ſhould
become a great lawyer, but merely becauſe, for a few years, his father did
not know how to diſpoſe of him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: but ſo unwearied has been
his application to the new method, that his father and the reſt of his
friends will, I doubt not, be ſurprized at his wonderful proficiency. As 
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:1252700302:377"/> nothing is of more conſequence to thoſe gentlemen,
who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to harangue at the bar, than the acquiring a ready elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and
an eaſy habit of delivering their thoughts in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, to this I paid
particular attention. For this purpoſe, I adviſed him to a diligent
attendance on the theatres, and I aſſure you, Mr. TOWN, he never fails to
take notes at a new play, and ſeldom or never miſſes appearing at one
houſe or the other in the green boxes. He has alſo gathered many beautiful
flowers of rhetorick, unblown upon by all other orators ancient or modern, from
the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society; and at the ſame place he has collected the
ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on every ſubject, and habituated himſelf to modes
of reaſoning never hitherto introduced into courts of juſtice. But what has
been of more than ordinary ſervice to him, and is particularly recommended by
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf, who calls 
<q rend="inline">"conference the life of ſtudy,"</q> is his
ſo frequent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at <hi>George</hi>'s and the other coffee-houſes
about the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where every ſtudent has ſo many opportunities
of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting himſelf by daily converſation with counſellors,
attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, clerks to attornies, and other ſages of law.</p>
                     <p>THE law is intended to take cogniſance of all our actions,
wherefore my pupil, who is fond of exerting his faculties in polite life, has
already digeſted almoſt all the grand lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points of the law into a
journal of his tranſactions, which I ſhall lay before my readers at large
in my treatiſe, as the beſt method for a common-place-book. Thus for
inſtance, having been frequently employed, after leaving the
<hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare,</hi> in what is called <hi>beating the rounds,</hi> it has
happened to him to be taken into cuſtody by the magiſtrate of the night,
and carried the next morning before a juſtice, by which means he has attained
as full a knowledge of certain parts of the duty of a conſtable and juſtice
of peace, as could be collected from <hi>Dalton, Blackerby,</hi> or
<hi>Burn.</hi> Certain impertinences of his taylor and other tradeſmen have
given him a very clear notion of the laws of arreſt, and been of as 
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:1252700302:378"/> much ſervice to him as the beſt treatiſes on bail
and main-prize. Beſides which, the ſeveral ſums of money which he has
taken up at different times payable on his father's death, have opened to him
ſome difficult points in conveyancing, by teaching him the nature of bonds,
deeds, &amp;c. and have at the ſame time ſhewn him what Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
calls, 
<q rend="inline">"the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and admirable ſecrets of the
common law,"</q> by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling to him the intricate doctrines of reverſion
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, as well as the general nature of eſtates. Thus he is
continually improving, and whenever he ſhould happen to commit a rape or a
genteel murder, it will ſerve him for matter of inſtruction as well as any
hiſtory of the pleas of the crown, and give him an inſight into the nature
of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and extent of the juriſdiction of our courts of
juſtice.</p>
                     <p>BY this plan of ſtudy no time is loſt; ſo that while
other ſtudents are idling away their vacation in the country, my pupil is
daily improving there. As he is a member of the aſſociation, he is very
converſant in all the laws enacted for the preſervation of the game; and he
picks up all the learning of the circuit by dancing at the Balls at the
aſſizes. As his father has a place, he is employed in canvaſſing for
votes at the time of an election, which inſtructs him in all the points of
law touching thoſe matters. He was principally concerned in diſcovering the
<hi>Cuſtomary Tenants,</hi> the new ſpecies of freeholders unknown to
<hi>Littleton, Coke,</hi> and all the lawyers of antiquity: and he is ſo
intimately acquainted with all the doctrine contained in the ſeveral
clauſes of the bribery act, that I propoſe publiſhing in the body of my
treatiſe <hi>Les Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Del Mon Seignior</hi> RIOT <hi>Sur L'Eſtatute
de</hi> 2 <hi>Geo.</hi> 2. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>BY this time, Mr. TOWN, you muſt perceive that the ground of
my ſcheme is in ſhort no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſtudent
ſhould regard his life as a kind of commentary on the law, as it is
recommended to the clergy to become examples of the doctrine they teach. Or to
bring my illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration more home to theſe gentlemen, let them learn the law
by being occaſionally intereſted in different parts of it, 
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:1252700302:379"/> as they become in ſome meaſure doctors of phyſic
from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent need of it, and can cure themſelves in certain caſes as well
as <hi>Rock</hi> himſelf. Inſtead of poring over books, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman need
only obſerve, how far the law and his actions tally with each other; and as
it is ſaid by Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"that the knowledge of the law is like a deep
well, out of which each man draweth according to the ſtrength of his
underſtanding,"</q> ſo in perſuance of my plan, the ſtudent will
improve according to the eagerneſs with which he engages in his pleaſures:
and this, no doubt, was intended by Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> as it is the moſt
obvious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his words, when he concludes the compariſon by
ſaying, that 
<q rend="inline">"when the profeſſor of the law can dive
into the depth, it is <hi>delightful, eaſy,</hi> and <hi>without any heavy
bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> ſo long as he keep himſelf <hi>in his own proper
element.</hi>"</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>WHAT plan, Mr. TOWN, can be more <hi>delightful, eaſy,</hi>
and <hi>without any heavy burthen</hi> than Inſtitutes of this nature? I have
indeed often looked with concern upon thoſe unhappy gentlemen who have
impaired their health by the old me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſtudy, and conſidered them as
martyrs to huge vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of reports and ſtatutes at large: my pupils will be
in no danger of theſe misfortunes. It is recorded of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent counſellor
of the <hi>North</hi> family, who being one of the ableſt practitioners at
the bar, was ſo overloaded with buſineſs, that ſometimes chuſing to
retire awhile from hurry and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, he would ſay to his clerk 
<q rend="inline">"Tell the people I do not practiſe this
term."</q> This proper relaxation I always recommend to my pupils, and have
ſome reaſon to think they are prudent enough to embrace it; for as I am
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſeveral ſtudents on the new plan, and do not remember to
have ſeen them doing any buſineſs in the courts for ſome time. I
ſuppoſe they had given notice to their clerks 
<q rend="inline">"to tell the people that they did not
practiſe in thoſe terms."</q>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE country at preſent, no leſs than the metropolis,
abounding with politicians of every kind, I begun to deſpair of picking up
any intelligence, that might poſſibly be entertaining to your readers.
However, I have made a tour to ſome of the moſt diſtant parts of the
kingdom with a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of my acquaintance; and ſhall not trouble you with
an account of the improvements that have been made in the ſeats we ſaw
according to the modern taſte, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <pb n="806" facs="tcp:1252700302:381"/> to give
you ſome reflections, which occurred to us on obſerving ſeveral country
churches, and the behaviour of their congregations.</p>
                     <p>THE ruinous condition of ſome of theſe churches gave me
great offence; and I could not help wiſhing, that the honeſt vicar,
inſtead of indulging his genius for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, by incloſing his
gooſeberry buſhes with a <hi>Chineſe</hi> rail, and converting half an
acre of his glebe-land into a bowling-green, would have applied part of his
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the more laudable purpoſe of ſheltering his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners from
the weather during their attendance on divine ſervice. It is no uncommon
thing to ſee the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonag -houſe well thatched, and in exceeding good
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, while the church perhaps has no better roof than the ivy that grows
over it. The noiſe of owls, bats and magpies makes a principal part of the
church muſick in many of theſe ancient edifices; and the walls, like a
large map, ſeem to be portioned out into capes, ſeas, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories by
the various colours with which the damps have ſtained them. Sometimes it has
happened, that the foundation being too weak to ſupport the ſteeple any
longer, it has been found expedient to pull down that part of the building, and
to hang the bells under a wooden ſhed on the ground beſide it. This is the
caſe in a pariſh in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> through which I lately paſſed,
and where the clerk and the ſexton, like the two figures at St.
<hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi>'s, ſerve the bells in capacity of clappers, by ſtriking
them alternately with a hammer.</p>
                     <p>IN other churches I have obſerved, that nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
or ruinous is to be found, except in the clergyman, and in the appendages of
his perſon. The ſquire of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <pb n="807" facs="tcp:1252700302:382"/> or his
anceſtors perhaps, to teſtify their devotion, and leave a laſting
monument of their magnificence, have adorned the altar-piece with the richeſt
crimſon velvet, embroidered with vine-leaves and ears of wheat, and have
dreſſed up the pulpit with the ſame ſplendour and expence; while the
gentleman who fills it is exalted in the midſt of all this finery with a
ſurplice as dirty as a farmer's frock, and a periwig that ſeems to have
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred its faculty of curling to the band, that appears in full-buckle
beneath it,</p>
                     <p>BUT if I was concerned to ſee many of our country churches
in a tottering condition, I was more offended with the indecency of worſhip
in others. I could wiſh that the paſtors would inform their hearers, that
there is no occaſion to ſcream themſelves hoarſe in making the
reſponſes, that the town-cryer is not the only perſon qualified to pray
with due devotion, and that he who bawls the loudeſt may nevertheleſs be
the wickedeſt fellow in the pariſh. The old women too in the ayle might be
told that their time would be better employed in attending to the ſermon,
than in fumbling over their tattered teſtaments till they have found the
text, by which time the diſcourſe is near drawing to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; while
a word or two of inſtruction might not be thrown away upon the younger part
of the congregation to teach them, that making poſies in ſummer-time, and
cracking nuts in autumn, is no part of the religious ceremony.</p>
                     <p>THE good old practice of pſalm-ſinging is, indeed,
wonderfully improved in many country churches ſince the days of
<hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins</hi>; and there is ſcarce a 
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:1252700302:383"/> pariſh-clerk, who has ſo little taſte as not to
pick his ſtaves out of the New Verſion. This has occaſioned great
complaints in ſome places, where the clerk has been forced to bawl by
himſelf, becauſe the reſt of the congregation cannot find the pſalm at
the end of their prayer-books; while others are highly diſguſted at the
innovation, and ſtick as obſtinately to the Old Verſion as to the Old
Stile. The tunes themſelves have alſo been new-ſet to jiggiſh
meaſures; and the ſober drawl, which uſed to accompany the two firſt
ſtaves of the hundredth pſalm with the <hi>gloria patri,</hi> is now
ſplit into as many quavers as an <hi>Italian</hi> air. For this purpoſe
there is in every county an itinerant band of vocal muſicians, who make it
their buſineſs to go round to all the churches in their turns, and, after a
prelude with the pitch-pipe, aſtoniſh the audience with hymns ſet to the
new <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> meaſure and anthems of their own compoſing. As
theſe new-faſhioned pſalmodiſts are neceſſarily made up of young
men and maids, we may naturally ſuppoſe, that there is a perfect concord
and ſymphony between them: and, indeed, I have known it happen, that theſe
ſweet ſingers have been brought more than once into diſgrace, by too
cloſe an uniſon between the thorough-baſe and the treble.</p>
                     <p>IT is a difficult matter to decide, which is looked upon to be
the greateſt man in a country church, the parſon or his clerk. The latter
is moſt certainly held in higher veneration, where the former happens to be
only a poor curate, who rides poſt every ſabbath from village to village,
and mounts and diſmounts at the church-door. The clerk's office is not only
to tag the prayers with an <hi>Amen,</hi> or uſher in the ſermon with a
ſtave; but he is alſo the univerſal <pb n="809" facs="tcp:1252700302:384"/> father to give
away the brides, and the ſtanding god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to all the new-born brats. But
in many places there is a ſtill greater man belonging to the church, than
either the parſon or the clerk himſelf. The perſon I mean is the
ſquire; who, like the King, may be ſtiled Head of the Church in his own
pariſh. If the benefice be in his own gift, the vicar is his creature, and of
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence entirely at his devotion: or, if the care of the church is left
to a curate, the Sunday fees of roaſt beef and plumb pudding, and a liberty
to ſhoot in the manor, will bring him as much under the ſquire's command as
his dogs and horſes. For this reaſon the bell is often kept tolling, and
the people waiting in the church-yard, an hour longer than the uſual time;
nor muſt the ſervice begin, till the ſquire has ſtrutted up the ayle,
and ſeated himſelf in the great pew in the chancel. The length of the
ſermon is alſo meaſured by the will of the ſquire, as formerly by the
hour-glaſs: and I know one pariſh where the preacher has always the
complaiſance to break off to a concluſion, the minute that the ſquire
gives the ſignal by riſing up after his nap.</p>
                     <p>IN a village church, the ſquire's lady or the vicar's wife
are perhaps the only females that are ſtared at for their finery: but in the
larger cities and towns, where the neweſt faſhions are brought down weekly
by the ſtage-coach or waggon, all the wives and daughters of the moſt
topping tradeſmen vie with each other every Sunday in the elegance of their
apparel. I could even trace the gradations in their dreſs according to the
opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the extent, and the diſtance of the place from <hi>London.</hi> I
was at church in a populous city in the north, where the mace-bearer cleared
the way for Mrs. Mayoreſs, <pb n="810" facs="tcp:1252700302:385"/> who came ſidling after
him in an enormous fan-hoop, of a pattern which had never been ſeen before in
thoſe parts. At another church in a corporation-town, I ſaw ſeveral
Negligeès, with furbelow'd aprons, which had long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the prize
of ſuperiority: but theſe were moſt woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully eclipſed by a burgeſs's
daughter juſt come from <hi>London,</hi> who appeared in a Trolloppeè
or Slammerkin, with treble ruffles to the cuffs, pinked and gymped, and the
ſides of the petticoat drawn up in feſtoons. In ſome leſſer borough
towns the conteſt, I found, lay between three or four black and green bibs
and aprons: at one a grocer's wife attracted our eyes by a new-faſhioned cap
called a Joan; and at another they were wholly taken up by a mercer's daughter
in a Nun's Hood.</p>
                     <p>I NEED not ſay any thing of the behaviour of the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in theſe more polite places of religious reſort; as the
ſame genteel ceremonies are practiſed there as at the moſt faſhionable
churches at the court end of the town. The ladies immediately on their entrance
breathe a pious ejaculation through their fan-ſticks, and the beaus very
gravely addreſs themſelves to the Haberdaſhers' Bills glewed upon the
linings of their hats. This pious duty is no ſooner performed, than the
exerciſe of bowing and curtſying ſucceeds; the locking and unlocking of
the pews drowns the reader's voice at the beginning of the ſervice, and the
ruſtling of ſilks, added to the whiſpering and tittering of ſo much
good company, renders him totally unintelligible to the very end of it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E, whoſe buſineſs it is to write looſe eſſays, and
who never talk above a quarter of an hour together on any one ſubject, are
not expected to enter into philoſophical diſquiſitions, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in
abſtract ſpeculations: but it is ſuppoſed to be our principal aim to
amuſe and inſtruct the reader by a lively repreſentation of what
paſſes round about him. Thus, like thoſe painters who delineate the 
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:1252700302:393"/> ſcenes of familiar life, we ſometimes give a
ſketch of a Marriage <hi>à là mode,</hi> ſometimes draw the
outlines of a Modern Midnight converſation, at another time paint the comical
diſtreſſes of itinerant Tragedians in a barn, and at another give a full
draught of the Rake's or Harlot's progreſs. Sometimes we divert the public by
exhibiting ſingle portraits; and when we meet with a ſubject where the
features are ſtrongly marked by nature, and there is ſomething peculiarly
characteriſtic in the whole manner, we employ ourſelves in drawing a full
length. In a word, we conſider all mankind as ſitting for their pictures,
and endeavour to work up our pieces with lively traits, and embelliſh them
with beautiful colouring: and though perhaps they are not always highly
finiſhed, yet they ſeldom fail of pleaſing ſome few at leaſt of the
vaſt multitude of Critics and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurs, if we are ſo happy as to
hit off a ſtriking likeneſs.</p>
               <p>THERE is perhaps no knowledge more requiſite, and certainly
none at preſent more ardently ſought after, than the Knowledge of the
World. In this ſcience we are more particularly expected to be adepts, as
well as to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, or at leaſt improve our readers in it. And though this
knowledge cannot be collected altogether from books, yet (as <hi>Pope</hi>
ſays) 
<q rend="inline">"Men may be read as well as books too much;"</q>
and it is to be lamented, that many, who have only conſulted the volume of
life as it lay open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, have rather become worſe than better by
their ſtudies. They, who have lived wholly in the world <pb n="819" facs="tcp:1252700302:394"/> without regarding the comments on it, are generally taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with
all its vices; to which the gathering part of their inſtructions from books
would perhaps have proved an antidote. There indeed, though they would have
ſeen the faults and foibles of mankind fairly repreſented, yet vice would
appear in an odious, and virtue in an amiable light; but thoſe, who unwarned
go abroad into the world, are often dazzled by the ſplendor with which wealth
gilds vice and infamy, and being accuſtomed to ſee bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot honeſty
treated with ſcorn, are themſelves induced to conſider it as
contemptible. For this reaſon I am a good deal offended at the ingenious
contrivance of our modern novelliſts and writers of comedy, who often gloſs
over a villainous character with the ſame falſe varniſh, that lackers
ſo many ſcoundrels in real life; and while they are exhibiting a fellow,
who debauches your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lies with your wife, repreſent him as an
agreeable creature, a man of gallantry, and a fine gentleman.</p>
               <p>THE world, even the gayeſt part of it, may be paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like
itſelf, and yet become a leſſon of inſtruction. The pieces of
<hi>Hogarth</hi> (to recur to the illuſtration I firſt made uſe of) are
faithful delineations of certain ſcenes of life, and yet vice and folly
always appear odious and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible. I could wiſh it were poſſible to
learn the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world without being 
<q rend="inline">"hackney'd in the ways of men;"</q> but as that
is impracticable, it is ſtill our duty ſo to live in it, as to avoid being
corrupted by our intercourſe with mankind. We ſhould endeavour to guard
againſt fraud, without becoming ourſelves deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; <pb n="820" facs="tcp:1252700302:395"/> and to ſee every ſpecies of vice and folly practiſed round
about us, without growing knaves and fools. The villainy of others is but a
poor excuſe for the loſs of our own integrity; and though, indeed, if I am
attacked on <hi>Hounſlow-Heath,</hi> I may lawfully kill the highwayman in my
own defence, yet I ſhould be very deſervedly brought to the gallows, if I
took a purſe from the next perſon I met, becauſe I had been robbed
myſelf.</p>
               <p>THE Knowledge of the World, as it is generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
conſiſts not ſo much in a due reflection on its vices and follies, as in
the practice of them; and thoſe, who conſider themſelves as beſt
acquainted with it, are either the dupes of faſhion, or ſlaves of
intereſt. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuppoſed to lie within the narrow compaſs of
every man's own ſphere of life, and receives a different interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in
different ſtations. Thus, for inſtance, the man of faſhion ſeeks it
no-where but in the polite circle of the <hi>beau-monde,</hi> while the man of
buſineſs looks no farther for it than the <hi>Alley.</hi> I ſhall beg
leave to illuſtrate this by two characters; each of whom, though
diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the other, has acquired a thorough Knowledge of
the World.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Harry Flaſh</hi> had the good luck to be born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his brother <hi>Richard:</hi> conſequently the heir to the eſtate was bred
a gentleman, and the other condemned to plod in the dull drudgery of
buſineſs. The merchant was ſent to learn accompts at the Academy upon
<hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> and the baronet had the finiſhing of his education in 
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:1252700302:396"/> 
                  <hi>France.</hi> Sir <hi>Harry</hi> is now a moſt
accompliſhed fine gentleman, is an excellent judge of faſhions, and can
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the odds at any game as readily as <hi>Hoyle</hi> or
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moivre:</hi> the Alderman is the moſt knowing man upon
<hi>'Change,</hi> and underſtands the riſe and fall of Stocks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than
any <hi>Jew.</hi> Both of them know the world; but with this difference, that
one by his conſummate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has run out a large eſtate, while the
other has raiſed a plumb by it.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude, it will be proper to take notice of the great
improvements made by our modern ladies in this part of their education. The
pretty creatures were formerly kept at home, and employed in the domeſtic
cares of good houſewifery: they were taught as much as poſſible to ſhun
the company of the men, and knew no more of the world than a cloiſtered Nun.
But theſe reſtraints are now happily removed by the preſent mode of
education. The little lady, inſtead of being ſent to the boarding-ſchool
to learn needle-work, is introduced to the politeſt routs and aſſemblies,
and taught to make one at the card-table: ſhe is carried about to
<hi>Vauxhall, Rane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh,</hi> and other genteel places of amuſement; and
beſides theſe, if we add a trip to <hi>Bath</hi> or <hi>Cheltenham,</hi>
there is no doubt but ſhe is completely verſed in the Knowledge of the
World. This, we muſt own, is very neceſſary to be attained by ladies of
faſhion: but it is with great concern that I have obſerved the inferior
rank of females fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the ſame ſchools, and learning the ſame
leſſons. Some have purchaſed their knowledge very dearly at the 
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:1252700302:397"/> expence of their reputation, while others have laid out
their whole fortunes to acquire it; and I could not but ſmile the other day
at reading an advertiſement in the public papers, begging our charity for a
poor diſtreſſed gentlewoman, who had formerly lived well, and ſeen a
great deal of the World.</p>

joined to ſuch an <hi>Epicurean</hi> conſort as I, thoſe expreſſions
that favour of the kitchen would have been real, inſtead of metaphorical. We
live in a land really flowing with milk and honey, and keep a houſe of
entertainment for all comers and goers. We <pb n="824" facs="tcp:1252700302:399"/> hardly ever
ſit down to table leſs in number than twenty or thirty, and very often to
above double that number of diſhes. In ſhort, ſir, ſo much feaſting
has given me a ſurfeit.</p>
                     <p>THERE are, I ſee, ſcattered up and down your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
ſeveral accounts of the petty diſtreſſes and domeſtic concerns of
private families. As you have liſtened to many complaints from huſbands, I
flatter myſelf you will not refuſe your attention to the humble
remonſtrance of a wife; being aſſured, that my only reaſon for thus
ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my dear lord as a new diſh to gratify the public taſte, is to
check (if poſſible) his violent paſſion for give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his friends
entertainments of another kind; which, if indulged much longer, muſt eat us
out of houſe and home.</p>
                     <p>THE magnificent feaſts of <hi>Timon</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi>
or the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hoſpitality, would give you but a
faint idea of the perpetual riot and luxury of our family. Our houſe is
always ſtored with as large a quantity of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as a garriſon in
expectation of a ſiege, and thoſe too of the deareſt and moſt
extravagant kind. Ortolans and woodcocks are as plenty as ſparrows, and red
mullets are ſcarce a greater rarity with us than gudgeons or ſprats; while
turtle and veniſon are regarded as branches of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen-luxury, which
ſcarce deſerve notice among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other delicacies in which we abound.
Authors, they ſay, (you will pardon me, Mr. TOWN,) are ſeldom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to
great entertainments; and I can aſſure you, that it is not eaſy for any,
but thoſe who are preſent, to conceive the parade and extravagance
diſplayed in our houſe. I myſelf am condemned to ſit at the head of the
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:1252700302:400"/> table, while my lord is placed at the other end, in pain
and uneaſineſs at my aukward miſtakes in <hi>doing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi> You
muſt know, ſir, that I was bred up under an houſewifely aunt in the
country, who taught me to pickle and preſerve, and gave me, as I thought, a
tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable notion of cookery. But, alas! though I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand plain boiled
and roaſt, and have a very good notion of a pudding, I am often totally
ignorant of the names and compoſitions of the delicacies before me, and have
imagined fiſh to be fowl, and miſtaken a <hi>petit pateè</hi> for a
plebeian mince-pie. In the mean time my lord is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing his exquiſite
taſte by deciding upon every diſh, and pronouncing with a critical ſmack
upon the flavour of the wines; all the while not a little ſolicitous about
the exactneſs of the Removes, and the duly adjuſting the
<hi>entremets.</hi> Claret, Burgundy, and Champagne are as common as ale or
ſmall-beer; and even Hermitage and Tokay are ſwallowed with as little
remorſe as Port of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon. To add to all this, is moſt abſurdly
introduced the <hi>French</hi> cuſtom of ſerving in <hi>les Liqueurs,</hi>
which conſiſt of almoſt as many ſorts as are contained in the
advertiſements from the Rich Cordial Warehouſe. In a word, every common
dinner with us is a feaſt; and when we have what my lord calls an
entertainment, it is an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch.</p>
                     <p>BUT there is no part of this monſtrous expence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects me
ſo much as the vaſt ſums ridiculouſly laviſhed on a Deſert. This
piece of folly and extravagance could be nothing but the joint product of a
<hi>Frenchman</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioner. After the gratification of the appetite
with more ſubſtantial fare, this whipt-ſyllabub raree-ſhew is ſerved
up chiefly to feed the eye; not but that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, <pb n="826" facs="tcp:1252700302:401"/>
of which the Deſert is compoſed, are as expenſive as the ſeveral
ingredients in the dinner: and I will leave you to your own method of rating
the reſt, after telling you that my lord thinks himſelf an excellent
oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, by having reduced the expence of the Hot-Houſe to a thouſand
<hi>per ann.</hi> which perhaps the admirers of exotic fruits will not think
dear, as we have pine-apples as plenty as golden-pippins or nonpareils.</p>
                     <p>ONE would think, that the firſt requiſite in eating was
extravagance, and that in order to have any thing very good, it muſt be eat
at a time that it is out of ſeaſon. Therefore one of the principal uſes
of our Hot-Houſe is to invert the order of nature, and to turn winter into
ſummer. We ſhould be aſhamed to ſee peas upon our table, while they are
to be had at a common market; but we never ſpare any coſt to provide a good
crop by the aſſiſtance of our hot-beds at <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> We have
no reliſh for cucumbers during the ſummer months, when they are no rarity;
but we take care to have them forced in <hi>November.</hi> But my lord moſtly
prides himſelf on the improvements that he has made in his Muſhroom-Beds,
which he has at length brought to ſo great perfection, that by the help of
horſe-dung, and throwing artificial ſun-beams through a burning-glaſs, we
can raiſe any quantity of Muſhrooms of the right <hi>Italian</hi> kind at
two hours warning.</p>
                     <p>FROM the Hot-Houſe we may make a very natural tranſition
to the Kitchen; and as in the former every thing muſt be produced out of
ſeaſon, ſo every thing in the latter muſt undergo a ſtrange
metamorphoſis. The ordinary diſtinctions of fiſh, fleſh, and fowl are
quite <pb n="827" facs="tcp:1252700302:402"/> deſtroyed; and nothing comes upon table under
its proper form and appellation. It is impoſſible to conceive what vaſt
ſums are melted down into ſauces! We have a cargo of hams every year from
<hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of them for
our ſoups; and we kill a brace of bucks every week, to make a <hi>Cullis</hi>
of the haunches. Half a dozen turkies have been killed in one day merely for
the ſake of the pinions; and I have known a whole pond dragged to furniſh a
diſh of Carps' Palates, and ten legs of mutton mangled raw to make out a
diſh of Pope's Eyes.</p>
                     <p>THE concomitant charges of the cellar, you will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, are
no leſs extravagant; and, indeed, it is not enough that we abound in the
beſt <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> wines, (which by the bye are
purchaſed on the ſpot at an extraordinary price,) but we muſt have
ſeveral other kinds of the higheſt value, and conſequently a moſt
delicious flavour. And though but a taſte of each has been ſipped round by
the company, the ſame bottles muſt never be brought a ſecond time upon
table, but are ſecured as perquiſites by the butler, who fells them to the
merchant, who ſells them back again to my lord. Beſides theſe, his
lordſhip has lately been at an immenſe charge in raiſing a Pinery, in
order to try the experiment of making Cyder of Pine-apples; which he hopes to
do at little more than treble the expence of Champagne. To this article I might
alſo add the charge of his Ice-Houſes: for although theſe are ſtored
with an home-commodity originally of no value, yet I may
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> to ſay, that every drop of
water comes as dear to us as the moſt coſtly of our wines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="828" facs="tcp:1252700302:403"/>AS all our liquors, I have told you, are
of foreign growth, and all our diſhes diſtinguiſhed by foreign titles,
you will readily conceive, that our houſhold is chiefly compoſed of
foreigners. The butler out of livery, and his two under-butlers, are
<hi>Frenchmen:</hi> the clerk of the kitchen is a <hi>Frenchman:</hi> and
<hi>Monſieur Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando,</hi> the head-cook, to be ſure is a
<hi>Frenchman.</hi> This gentleman never ſoils his fingers in touching the
leaſt bit of any thing, but gives his orders (like a general) to four
ſubalterns, who are likewiſe <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> The baker, the
confectioner, the very ſcullions, and even the fellow that looks after the
poultry, are all of them <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> Theſe, you may be ſure, are
maintained at very high ſalaries: and though <hi>Monſieur Fricando</hi> had
the pay of a captain in a marching regiment, my lord was forced to double his
wages at the beginning of the war, and allow him the free exerciſe of his
<hi>religion,</hi> to prevent his leaving the kingdom.</p>
                     <p>I AM ſorry to add, that this pride of keeping a table has
viſibly impaired my lord's fortunes: and this very ſummer he has been
obliged to fell all the timber on his eſtate, as I may ſay, to keep up his
kitchen fire. The only ſatisfaction he can poſſibly reap from all this
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is the vanity of having it ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"that no-body treats ſo elegantly as his
lordſhip,"</q> and now and then perhaps reading in the news-papers, 
<q rend="inline">"that ſuch a day the right honourable
— gave a grand entertainment at his houſe in —, at which were
preſent the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers of State and Foreign Miniſters."</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the comedy of the <hi>Frenchman in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which we
are told was acted at <hi>Paris</hi> with univerſal applauſe for ſeveral
nights together, there is a character of a rough <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who is
repreſented as quite unſkilled in the graces of converſation; and his
dialogue is made up of almoſt nothing but a repetition of the common
ſalutation of <hi>how do you do, how do you do?</hi> Our nation has, indeed,
been generally ſuppoſed to be of a ſullen and uncommunicative
diſpoſition; while, on <pb n="830" facs="tcp:1252700302:405"/> the other hand, the
loquacious <hi>French</hi> have been allowed to poſſeſs the art of
converſing beyond all other people. The <hi>Engliſhman</hi> requires to be
wound up frequently, and ſtops as ſoon as he is down; but the
<hi>Frenchman</hi> runs on in a continued alarum. Yet it muſt be
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſiſt of very different
hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, their manner of diſcourſe admits of great variety: but the whole
<hi>French</hi> nation converſe alike; and there is no difference in their
addreſs between a <hi>Marquis</hi> and a <hi>Valet de Chambre.</hi> We may
frequently ſee a couple of <hi>French</hi> barbers accoſting each other in
the ſtreet, and paying their compliments with the ſame volubility of
ſpeech and grimace of action, as two courtiers in the
<hi>Thuilleries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I SHALL not attempt to lay down any particular rules for
converſation, but point out ſuch faults in the diſcourſe and behaviour,
as render the company of half mankind rather tedious than amuſing. It is in
vain, indeed, to look for converſation, where we might expect to find it in
the greateſt perfection, among perſons of faſhion; where it is almoſt
annihilated by univerſal card-playing: inſomuch that I have heard it given
as a reaſon, why it is impoſſible for our preſent writers to ſucceed
in the dialogue of genteel comedy, that our people of quality ſcarce ever
meet but to game. All their diſcourſe turns upon the odd trick and the four
honours: and it is no leſs a maxim with the votaries of Whiſt than with
thoſe of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that talking ſpoils company. Every one
endeavours to make himſelf as agreeable to ſociety as he can: but it often
happens, that thoſe, who moſt aim at ſhining in converſation,
over-ſhoot their mark: and though a man ſucceeds, he ſhould not (as is
frequently <pb n="831" facs="tcp:1252700302:406"/> the caſe) engroſs the whole talk to
himſelf; for that deſtroys the very eſſence of converſation, which is
talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together. We ſhould try to keep up converſation like a ball
bandied to and fro from one to the other, rather than ſeize it all to
ourſelves, and drive it before us like a foot-ball. We ſhould likewiſe be
cautious to adapt the matter of our diſcourſe to our company; and not talk
<hi>Greek</hi> before the ladies, or of the laſt new furbelow to a meeting of
country juſtices.</p>
               <p>THE peſts and nuiſances of ſociety, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to
be met with, may be ranged in the following manner. And firſt, the
Attitudinarians and Face-makers. Theſe accompany every word with a peculiar
grimace or geſture: they aſſent with a ſhrug, and contradict with a
twiſting of the neck; are angry with a wry mouth, and pleaſed in a caper or
a minuet ſtep. They may be conſidered as ſpeaking Harlequins; and their
rules of eloquence are taken from the poſture-maſter. Theſe ſhould be
condemned to converſe only in dumb ſhew with their own perſons in the
looking-glaſs; as alſo the Smirkers and Smilers, who ſo prettily ſet
off their faces together with their words by a <hi>je ne ſçai
quoi</hi> between a grin and a dimple. With theſe we may likewiſe rank the
affected tribe of Mimics, who are conſtantly taking off the peculiar tone of
voice or geſture of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: though they 
<q rend="inline">"imitate humanity ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,"</q> that
(like bad painters) they are frequently forced to write the name under the
picture, before we can diſcover any likeneſs.</p>
               <p>NEXT to theſe, whoſe elocution conſiſts chiefly in the
action, we may conſider the profeſt ſpeakers. And firſt, 
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:1252700302:407"/> of the Emphatical; who ſqueeze, and preſs, and beat
down every ſyllable with as much vehemence, as a paviour thumps the pebbles
with his rammer. Theſe energetic orators are remarkable for the force of
expreſſion, with which they utter the particle <hi>the</hi> and conjunctive
<hi>and</hi>; which they ſeem to hawk up with much difficulty out of their
own throats, and to cram them with no leſs pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ears of their
auditors. Theſe ſhould be ſuffered only to ſyringe (as it were) the
ears of a deaf man through an hearing trumpet: and with theſe we may join the
Whiſperers or Low Speakers, who come up ſo cloſe to you, that they may be
ſaid to meaſure noſes with you, and have frequently a ſtinking breath.
I would have theſe oracular gentry obliged to talk at a diſtance through a
ſpeaking trumpet, or apply their lips to the walls of a whiſpering gallery.
The Wits, who will not condeſcend to utter any thing but a <hi>bon mot,</hi>
and the Whiſtlers or Tune-hummers, who never articulate at all, may be joined
very agreeably together in concert: and to theſe tinkling cymbals I would
alſo add the ſounding braſs; the Bawler, who inquires after your health
with the bellowing of a town-cryer.</p>
               <p>THE Tatlers, whoſe pliable pipes are admirably adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the

<q rend="inline">"ſoft parts of converſation,"</q> and
ſweetly 
<q rend="inline">"prattling out of faſhion,"</q> make very
pretty muſick from a beautiful face and a female tongue: but from a rough
manly voice and coarſe features it is as harſh and diſſonant as a jig
from a bagpipe. The Half-Swearers, who ſplit, and mince, and fritter their
oaths into <hi>gad's bud, ad's fiſh</hi> and <hi>demmee,</hi> and the
Humbuggers, and thoſe who nickname God's creatures, who call a man a
cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, a crab, a queer cub, an odd fiſh, and an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable 
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:1252700302:408"/> muſkin, ſhould never come into company with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an
interpeter. But I ſhall not tire my reader's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by pointing out
others, no leſs deſtructive of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: ſuch as the Senſibles, who
pronounce dogmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the moſt trivial points, and ſpeak in
ſentences; the Wonderers, who are always <hi>wondering</hi> what o'clock it
is, or <hi>wondering</hi> whether it will rain or no, or <hi>wondering</hi>
when the moon changes; and laſtly, the Silent Men, who ſeem afraid of
opening their mouths for fear of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, and literally obſerve the
precept of the goſpel, by letting their converſation be only <hi>yea
yea,</hi> and <hi>nay nay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE rational intercourſe, which is mutually kept up among men
by converſing with each other, is one of our principal diſtinctions from
brutes: and it is imagined by ſome philoſophers, that birds and beaſts
(though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of articulation) perfectly underſtand one another
by the ſounds they utter; and that dogs, cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have each a
particular language to themſelves, like different nations. Thus it may be
ſuppoſed, that the nightingales of <hi>Italy</hi> have as fine an ear for
their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive wood-notes, as any <hi>Signor</hi> or <hi>Signora</hi> for an
<hi>Italian Air;</hi> that the boars of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> gruntle as
expreſſively through the noſe, as the inhabitants in
<hi>High-German</hi>; and that the frogs in the dykes of <hi>Holland</hi> croak
as intelligibly as the natives jabber their <hi>High-Dutch.</hi> However this
may be, we may conſider thoſe, who let their tongues always vibrate as
their hearts beat, and do not keep up the proper converſation of human
creatures, as imitating the language of different animals. Thus, for
inſtance, the affinity between Chatterers and Monkeys, and Praters and
Parrots, is too obvious not to occur at once: Grunters <pb n="834" facs="tcp:1252700302:409"/>
and Growlers may be juſtly compared to Hogs: Snarlers are Curs, that
continually ſhew their teeth, but never bite; and the Spitfire Paſſionate
are a ſort of wild Cats, that will not bear ſtroaking, but will purr when
they are pleaſed. Complainers are Scriech-Owls; and Story-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who are
always repeating the ſame dull note, are Cuckows. Poets, that prick up their
ears at their own hideous braying, are no better than Aſſes: Critics in
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are venomous ſerpents, that delight in hiſſing; and ſome of
them, who have got by heart a few technical terms without knowing their
meaning, are no other than Magpies. I myſelf, who have crowed to the whole
town for near three years paſt, may perhaps put my readers in mind of a
Dunghill Cock: but as I muſt acquaint them, that they will hear the laſt of
me on this day fortnight, I hope they will then conſider me as a Swan, who is
ſuppoſed to ſing ſweetly at his dying moments.</p>

                        <salute>DEAR COUSIN,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>IT was not without ſome regret, that I received advice of
your intentions to bid adieu to the public: for as you had been ſo kind as to
introduce me to their notice, I began to indulge all the weakneſs and vanity
of a young author; and had almoſt perſuaded myſelf, that I was the
principal ſupport of your papers. Conſcious of my own importance, I expect
that you will do me the juſtice to acknowledge, how much you are indebted to
the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance <pb n="836" facs="tcp:1252700302:411"/> of your very ingenious Couſin;
and I care not how many compliments you pay me on my wit and learning: but at
the ſame time I muſt beg leave to put in a caveat againſt your
diſpoſing of me in what manner you yourſelf pleaſe. Writers of
eſſays think themſelves at liberty to do what they will with the
characters they have introduced into their works: as writers of tragedy, in
order to heighten the plot, have brought their heroes to an untimely end, when
they have died quietly many years before in their beds; or as our chroniclers
of daily occurrences put a duke to death, give away an heireſs in marriage,
or ſhoot off an admiral's legs, whenever they pleaſe. Mr. ADDISON, while he
was carrying on the SPECTATOR, ſaid 
<q rend="inline">"he would kill Sir <hi>Roger de Coverly,</hi>
that nobody elſe might murder him:"</q> In like manner, my dear Couſin, you
may perhaps take it into your head to cut me off: you may make an end of me by
a cold caught in partridge-ſhooting, or break my neck in a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunt. Or
you may rather chuſe to ſettle me perhaps with a rich old country dowager,
or preſs me into the army, or clap me on board of a man of war. But I
deſire that you will not get rid of me by any of theſe means: but permit me
to aſſure your readers, that I am alive and merry; and this is to let them
know, that I am in good health at this preſent writing.</p>
                     <p>YOUR papers, I aſſure you, have made a great noiſe in
the country; and the moſt intelligent among us read you with as much
ſatisfaction as the <hi>Evening Poſts</hi> or the <hi>Weekly Journals.</hi>
I know more than one ſquire, who who takes them in conſtantly with the
<hi>Magazines</hi>; and I was told by the poſt-maſter of a certain town,
that they came down every week under cover to the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of a member of
parliament. There is a club of country parſons, who meet every
<hi>Saturday</hi> at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring market-town, to be ſhaved and exchange
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: they have a ſubſcription for books and pamphlets; and the only
periodical works ordered in by them are <pb n="837" facs="tcp:1252700302:412"/> the
<hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> and the <hi>Critical</hi> and <hi>Monthly
Reviews.</hi> I was lately introduced to this ſociety, when the
conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation happened to turn upon Mr. TOWN. A young curate, juſt come
from <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſaid he knew you very well at <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi>
and that you was a comical dog: but a <hi>Cantab.</hi> declared no leſs
poſitively, that you was either a pensioner of <hi>Trinity</hi> or a commoner
of <hi>Bennet</hi>'s. People, indeed, are very much perplexed about the real
author: ſome affirm, that you are a nobleman; and others will have it, that
you are an actor: ſome ſay you are a young lawyer, ſome a parſon, and
ſome an old woman.</p>
                     <p>THE ſubjects of your papers have often been wreſted to
various interpretations by our penetrating geniuſſes; and you have hardly
drawn a character, that has not been fixed on one or other of the greateſt
perſonages in the nation. I once heard a country juſtice expreſs his
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you was not taken up, and ſet in the pillory; and I myſelf,
by ſome of my rural intelligence, have brought upon you the reſentment of
ſeveral honeſt ſquires, who long to horſe-whip the ſcoundrel for
putting them in print. Others again are quite at a loſs how to pick out your
meaning, and in vain turn over their <hi>Bailey</hi>'s dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for an
explanation of ſeveral faſhionable phraſes; which, though they have
enriched the town-language, have not yet made their way into the dialect of the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Many exquiſite ſtrokes of humour are alſo loſt upon us, on
account of our diſtance from the ſcene of action; and the wit, which is
very briſk and lively upon the ſpot, loſes much of its ſpirit in the
carriage, and ſometimes wholly evaporates in the poſt-bag.</p>
                     <p>YOU moraliſts are very apt to flatter yourſelves, that you
are doing a vaſt deal of good by your labours: but whatever reformation you
may have worked in town, give me leave to tell you, that you have ſometimes
done us harm in the country, by the bare mention of the vices 
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:1252700302:413"/> and follies now in vogue. From your intelligence ſome
of our moſt polite ladies have learned, that it is highly genteel to have a
route; and ſome have copied the faſhion ſo exactly, as to play at cards
on <hi>Sundays.</hi> Your papers upon dreſs ſet all our belles at work in
following the mode: you no ſooner took notice of the cocked hats, but every
hat in the pariſh was turned up behind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and when you told us,
that the town-beauties went naked, our rural damſels immediately began to
throw off their cloaths. Our gentlemen have been alſo taught by you all the
new arts of betting and gaming: and the only coffee-houſe in one little town,
where the moſt topping inhabitants are uſed to meet to play at draughts and
back-gammon, has, from the great increaſe of gameſters who reſort to it,
been elegantly chriſtened by the name of <hi>White</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>AS to the ſmall ſhare, which I myſelf have had in your
work, you may be ſure every body here is hugely delighted with it; at leaſt
you may be ſure, that I will ſay nothing to the contrary. I have done my
beſt to contribute to the entertainment of your readers: and as the name of
<hi>Steele</hi> is not forgot in the SPECTATOR, though <hi>Addiſon</hi> has
run away with almoſt all the honour, I am in hopes that whenever the great
Mr. TOWN is mentioned, they may poſſibly think at the ſame time on</p>
                     <closer>
                        <signed>Your affectionate Couſin and Coadjutor,
VILLAGE.</signed>

               </floatingText>
               <p>AFTER this account, which my Couſin has ſent me, of the
reception I have met with in the country, it will be proper to ſay
ſomething of my reception here in town. I ſhall therefore conſider
myſelf in the threefold capacity of CONNOISSEUR, CRITIC, and CENSOR-GENERAL.
As a CONNOISSEUR, in the confined ſenſe of the word, I muſt own I have
met with ſeveral mortifications. I have neither been made F. R. S. nor even a
member of the Academy of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> or <hi>Peterſburgh.</hi> They
have left <pb n="839" facs="tcp:1252700302:414"/> me out of the liſt of Truſtees to the
<hi>Britiſh Muſaeum</hi>; and his Majeſty of <hi>Naples,</hi> though he
preſented an "Account of the Curioſities found in <hi>Herculaneum</hi>" to
each of the univerſities, never ſent one to me. I have not been celebrated
in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, or in any of our Magazines of Arts and
Sciences; nor have I been ſtiled <hi>tres-illuſtre</hi> or
<hi>tres-ſçavant</hi> in any of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Mercures</hi> or
<hi>Journals Literaires.</hi> Once indeed, I ſoothed myſelf in the vain
thought of having been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the great <hi>Swediſh</hi>
Botaniſt, <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> under the title of <hi>Eruditiſſimus
Urbanus,</hi> which I conceited to be the name of TOWN latinized; but to my
great diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment I afterwards diſcovered, that this was no other than
the learned Naturaliſt, Mr. <hi>Silvanus Urban,</hi> author of the
<hi>Gentleman's Magazine.</hi> This neglect of me, as a CONNOISSEUR, I can
attribute to no other cauſe, than to my not having made myſelf known by my
<hi>Muſaeum</hi> or Cabinet of Curioſities: and to ſay the truth, I am
not worth a farthing in antique coins; nor have I ſo much as one ſingle
ſhell or butterfly. All my complaints againſt the modern innovations of
Taſte have been therefore diſregarded: and with concern I ſtill ſee the
Villas of our citizens fantaſtically adorned with <hi>Chineſe</hi> palings,
and our ſtreets encumbered with ſuperb colonnades, porticos,
<hi>Gothic</hi> arches, and <hi>Venetian</hi> windows, before the ſhops of
our tradeſmen.</p>
               <p>NOR have I, as a CRITIC, met with greater ſucceſs or
encouragement in my endeavours to reform the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Taſte in literature.
I expected to have the priviledge of eating beef <hi>gratis</hi> every night at
<hi>Vauxhall,</hi> for adviſing the garden-poets to put a little meaning into
their ſongs: but though I was there ſeveral nights this ſummer, I could
not ſay (with <hi>Caſſio</hi>) of any of their productions, 
<q rend="inline">"this is a more exquiſite ſong than
t'other."</q> I have not been able to write the operas out of the kingdom: and
though I have more than once ſhewed my contempt for Harlequin, I am
aſſured there are no leſs than three <pb n="840" facs="tcp:1252700302:415"/> Pantomimes to
be brought on this ſeaſon. As I ſet my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up for ſupreme judge in
theatrical matters, I was in hopes, that my Lord Chamberlain would at leaſt
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me his Deputy-Licenſer; but he has not even conſult me on any
one new play. I made no doubt, but the managers would pay their court to me:
but they have not once ſent for me to dinner; and ſo far from having the
freedom of the houſe, I declare I have not had ſo much as a ſingle order
from any of the under-actors.</p>
               <p>IN my office of CENSOR-GENERAL, though I cannot boaſt of
having over-turned the card-tables at routs and aſſemblies, or broke up the
club at <hi>Arthur</hi>'s, I can ſafely boaſt, that I have routed the
many-headed monſter at the Diſputant Society at the <hi>Robin-hood,</hi>
and put to ſilence the great <hi>Clare-market</hi> Orator. In a word, I have
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to prevent the growth of vice and immorality; and with as much effect
as the Juſtices at the Quarter-ſeſſions. For this reaſon I expected
to have been put into commiſſion, and to have had the power of licenſing
all places of public diverſion veſted ſolely in my hands. But as I find
my merits have been hitherto overlooked, I am determined to lay down my office;
and in my next num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I ſhall take my final leave of the public, when I
ſhall give them an account or my correſpondents, together with a full and
particular account of MYSELF.</p>

acquaintance of the public with the aukward air and diſtance of a ſtranger;
but be now flatters himſelf, that they will look upon him as an old
companion, whoſe <pb n="842" facs="tcp:1252700302:417"/> converſation they are pleaſed
with; and, as they will ſee him no more after this time, will now and then
perhaps miſs their uſual viſiter.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this may be, the Authors of the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOISSEUR now think
proper to cloſe the undertaking, in which they have been engaged for near
three years paſt: and among their general thanks to the indulgent readers of
their papers, they muſt include in a particular manner their acknowledgments
to thoſe, who have been pleaſed to appear in them as writers. They have,
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the cloſe of their work brought Mr. TOWN and all his
aſſociates on the ſcene together, like the <hi>dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis perſonae</hi>
at the end of the laſt act.</p>
               <p>OUR earlieſt and moſt frequent correſpondent is only known
to us by the initials G. K. and we are ſorry, that he will not put it in our
power to mention his name; which (if we are not miſtaken in our gueſs)
would reflect as much credit on our work, as we are ſure will redound to it
from his contributions. To him we are proud to own ourſelves indebted for
moſt part of N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 14 and 17; for the letter, ſigned <hi>Goliah
Engliſh,</hi> in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 19; for a great part of N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 33 and 40; and for the
letters, ſigned <hi>Reginald Fitzworm, Michael Krawbidge, Moſes
Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>T. Vainall,</hi> in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 102, 107, 113, and 129.</p>
               <p>THE next, in priority of time, is a gentleman of
<hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who ſigned himſelf A. B. and we cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
that he withdrew his aſſiſtance, after having obliged us with the beſt
part of the letters in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 46, 49, and 52; and of the eſſays in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 62
and 64.</p>
               <p>THE letters in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 82, 98, 112, and 130, came from various
hands, equally unknown to us. The Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Horace,</hi> in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 11,
was written (as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) by a gentleman of <hi>Oxford:</hi> the Ode to
Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 125, was ſent to us by a gentleman of
<hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>; and from two other gentlemen of that Univerſity we
received the letter, ſigned <hi>W. Manly,</hi> in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 65, and another,
ſigned B. A. in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 107.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="843" facs="tcp:1252700302:418"/>THESE unexpected marks of favour,
conferred on us by ſtrangers, demand our higheſt gratitude: but we are no
leſs happy in being able to boaſt of the aſſiſtance of ſome other
gentlemen, whom we are proud to call friends, though we are not at liberty to
introduce them to the acquaintance of our readers. From a friend, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in
the Law, we had the firſt ſketches and moſt ſtriking paſſages in
N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 75, 78, 87, and 104; though it may be regretted by the public as well as
ourſelves, that his leiſure would not permit him to put the finiſhing
hand to them. From a friend, a gentleman of the <hi>Temple,</hi> we received
N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 111, 115, and 119. To a friend, a member of <hi>Trinity College,
Cambridge,</hi> we are indebted for the Song in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 72, and the Verſes in
N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 67, 90, 125, and 135. The liſt of contributions from ſuch capable
friends would doubtleſs have been much larger, had they been ſooner let
into the ſecret: but as Mr. TOWN, like a great prince, choſe to appear
<hi>incog.</hi> in order to avoid the impertinence of others, he did not even
make himſelf known to thoſe about his perſon, till at laſt they
themſelves found him out through his diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſtill remaining two correſpondents, who muſt
ſtand by themſelves; as they have wrote to us, not in an aſſumed
character, but <hi>in propriâ perſonâ.</hi> The firſt is no
leſs a perſonage than the great Orator HENLY, who obliged us with that
truly original letter, printed in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 37. The other, who favoured us with a
letter no leſs original in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 70, we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is a
Methodiſt Teacher and a mechanic; but we do not know either his name or his
trade.</p>
               <p>WE now come to the moſt important diſcovery of Ourſelves,
and to anſwer the often-repeated queſtion of; <hi>Who is Mr.</hi> TOWN? it
being the cuſtom for periodical writers, at the ſame time that they ſend
the hawkers abroad with their laſt dying ſpeech like the malefactors, like
them alſo to couple it with a confeſſion. The general method of
unravelling this myſtery is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, to whom the different ſignatures
affixed to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent papers are appropriated. For ever ſince the days of the
inimitable SPECTATOR, it has been uſual for a <pb n="844" facs="tcp:1252700302:419"/> bold
Capital to ſtand, like a ſentry, at the end of our eſſays, to guard the
author in ſecreſy: and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuppoſed, that the writer, who
does not chuſe to put his name to his work, has in this manner, like the
painters and ſtatuaries of old, at leaſt ſet his mark. But the Authors of
the CONNOISSEUR now confeſs, that the ſeveral letters, at firſt pitched
upon to bring up the rear of their eſſays, have been annexed to different
papers at random, and ſometimes omitted, on purpoſe to put the ſagacious
reader on a wrong ſcent. It is particularly the intereſt of a writer, who
prints himſelf out week by week, to remain unknown during the courſe of
this piece-meal publication. The beſt method, therefore, to prevent a
diſcovery is to make the road to it as intricate as poſſible; and,
inſtead of ſeeming to aim at keeping the reader entirely in the dark, to
hang out a kind of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering light, which only ſerves to lead him aſtray.
The deſire of giving each writer his due, according to the ſignatures, has
in the courſe of this undertaking often confuſed the curious in their
inquiries. Soon after the publication of our firſt papers, ſome ingenious
gentlemen found out, that T, O, W, N, being the letters that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name
of TOWN, there were four authors, each of whom ſheltered himſelf under a
particular letter; but no paper ever appearing with an N affixed to it, they
were obliged to give up this notion. But, if they had been more able
decypherers, they would have made out, that though T, O, W, will not compoſe
the name of TOWN, yet by a different arrangement of the letters it will form
the word TWO; which is the grand myſtery of our ſignatures, and couches
under it the true and real number of the Authors of the CONNOISSEUR.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus declared Mr. TOWN to conſiſt of two ſeparate
individuals, it will perhaps be expected that, like two tradeſmen, who have
agreed to diſſolve their part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip, we ſhould exactly ballance our
accounts, and aſſign to each his due parcel of the ſtock. But our
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are of ſo intricate a nature, that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for
us to adjuſt them in that manner. We have not only joined in the work taken
altogether, but almoſt every ſingle paper is the joint product of both:
and, as we have laboured equally in erecting the fabric, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not 
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:1252700302:420"/> pretend, that any one particular part is the ſole
work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of either. An hint has perhaps been ſtarted by one of us,
improved by the other, and ſtill further heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by an happy coalition of
ſentiment in both; as fire is ſtruck out by a mutual colliſion of flint
and ſteel. Sometimes, like <hi>Strada</hi>'s lovers converſing with the
ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic needles, we have written papers together at fifty miles
diſtance from each other: the firſt rough draught or looſe minutes of an
eſſay have often travelled in the ſtage-coach from town to country, and
from country to town; and we have frequently waited for the poſtman (whom we
expected to bring us the precious remainder of a CONNOISSEUR) with the ſame
anxiety, as we ſhould wait for the half of a bank note, without which the
other half would be of no value. Theſe our joint labours, it may eaſily be
imagined, would have ſoon broke off ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, if either had been too fondly
attached to his own little conceits; or if we had converſed together with the
jealouſy of a rival, or the complaiſance of a formal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who
ſmiles at every word that is ſaid by his companion. Nor could this work
have been ſo long car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, with ſo much chearfulneſs and good-humour
on both ſides, if the Two had not been as cloſely united, as the two
Students, whom the SPECTATOR mentions as recorded by a <hi>Terrae Filius</hi>
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"to have had but one mind, one purſe, one
chamber, and one hat."</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT has been often remarked, that the reader is very deſirous
of picking up ſome little particulars concerning the author of the book,
which he is peruſing. To gratify this paſſion, many literary anecdotes
have been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an account of their life, character, and behaviour,
has been prefixed to the works of our moſt celebrated writers.
Eſſayiſts are commonly expected to be their own Biographers: and perhaps
our readers may require ſome further intelligence concerning the Authors of
the CONNOISSEUR. But, as they have all along ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as a ſort of
<hi>Sofias</hi> in literature, they cannot now deſcribe themſelves any
otherwiſe, than as one and the ſame perſon; and can only ſatisfy the
curioſity of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, by giving a ſhort account of that reſpectable
perſonage Mr. TOWN, conſidering him as of the plural, or rather (according
to the <hi>Grecians</hi>) of the dual number.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="846" facs="tcp:1252700302:421"/>Mr. TOWN is a fair, black, middle-ſized,
very ſhort man. He wears his own hair, and a perriwig. He is about thirty
years of age, and not more than four and twenty. He is a Student of the Law,
and a Batchelor of Phyſic. He was bred at the Univerſity of
<hi>Oxford;</hi> where having taken no leſs than three degrees, he looks down
on many learned Profeſſors, his inferiors: yet having been there but little
longer than to take the firſt degree of Batchelor of Arts, it has more than
once happened, that the CEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOR-GENERAL of all <hi>England</hi> has been
reprimanded by the Cenſor of his College, for neglecting to furniſh the
uſual Eſſay, or (in the collegiate phraſe) the Theme of the week.</p>
               <p>This joint deſcription of ourſelves will, we hope,
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the reader without any further information. For our own parts, we
cannot but be pleaſed with having raiſed this monument of our mutual
friendſhip and eſteem: and if theſe eſſays ſhall continue to be
read, when they will no longer make their appearance as the fugitive pieces of
the week, we ſhall be happy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that we are mentioned at the
ſame time. We have all the while gone on, as it were, hand in hand together:
and white we are both employed in furniſhing matter for the paper now before
us, we cannot help ſmiling at our thus making our <hi>exit</hi> together,
like the two Kings of <hi>Brentford</hi> ſmelling at one noſegay.</p>
