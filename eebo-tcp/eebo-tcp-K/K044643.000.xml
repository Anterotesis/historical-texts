            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due Seaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AS the chief Purport and Deſign of the holy Apoſtle, thoughout his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> was to exhort his Fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Vineyard of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to a Continuance in well-doing, to a ſteady Zeal and Perſeverance in the great and important Buſineſs aſſign'd to their Care; he takes Occaſion, in the Concluſion of it, to put them in Mind of that grand Point on which their Succeſs muſt in a great Meaſure depend; to enforce the Neceſſity of a firm and unalterable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and at the ſame Time to intimate to them the Advantages, which wou'd naturally flow from ſuch a Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be weary in well-doing, for in due Seaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0325600400:3"/>
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was no Stranger to human Nature and all its Infirmities; who knew how Men are for the moſt Part guided by their Hopes and Fears; who knew how arduous a Taſk they had engaged in; who probably knew alſo that they had been perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and oppreſs'd, and were perhaps greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited and caſt down; endeavours to comfort, and ſupport them by a Promiſe of better Succeſs, and a ſtrong Aſſurance of future Reward; <hi>we ſhall reap,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in due Seaſon, if we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Mind of Man is ever fluctuating and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, fond of Novelty and impatient of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, as good Intents and Diſpoſitions come upon us, as it were, but by Starts and Sallies, and even in the beſt of us are ſeldom of long Duration; no Caution can be more neceſſary than that given in the Text, nor any ſtronger Motive to induce us to a Compliance with it than that which is there annex'd.</p>
            <p>It is with great Truth obſerved of all human Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that the Satisfaction lies more in the Purſuit than in the Enjoyment of them: The Sport is in the Chace and not the Game; and thus it is in moſt of our Actions. Whilſt we have Novelty to delight us, we feel neither Fatigue nor Satiety; but when we have got up the Hill, and view'd the whole Proſpect, our Eyes begin to wander after freſh Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Deſire grows languid, and ſomething elſe is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0325600400:4"/>
wanting to revive, and ſet it at Work again. How many noble and excellent Deſigns, calculated to promote the Welfare of Society, have been thrown aſide merely through Liſtleſſneſs and want of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance! It is much eaſier to begin than to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in any good and praiſe-worthy Undertaking. Nothing doth in Reality ſo much deſtroy the Credit of Morality as Indolence, and Wavering; nothing doth ſo much promote and honour it as Steadineſs and Reſolution: But I know not how it is, Vice and Folly have gain'd over Induſtry to their Party, and all the Endeavours of Reaſon and Religion to render Virtue habitual are ineffectual. How ſoon do Men faint in the Race of true Glory! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable are they in the Purſuit of falſe! how ſeldom weary of doing ill! how languid in Actions of Goodneſs or Beneficence! The <hi>Feet of the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> and revengeful are ſlow to ſerve the wretched, but <hi>ſwift to ſhed Blood:</hi> Evil Doers are reſolute, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, vigilant; while the Followers of Good want perpetual Monitors to awaken, and ſtimulate them. There is always a <hi>Lion in the Path</hi> to obſtruct them. Every Obſtacle alarms; every Diſappointment checks; every Danger throws them into Doubt, Diffidence, and Deſpair. How diſgraceful is it to the Cauſe of Truth that the Advocates for Falſehood ſhould ſo far exceed them in Zeal and Alacrity; and that the Reſolution and Firmneſs, which would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0325600400:5"/>
throw ſo great a Luſtre on Virtue and Religion, ſhould be liſted in the Service of Vice and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery! Shall we never be perſuaded to make that, which is our Intereſt and Duty, our Pleaſure alſo and our Happineſs? Shall not all thoſe, who are already engaged, reſolve to continue in well-doing? Let us reſt aſſured we ſhall meet with a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward; that <hi>we ſhall</hi> certainly <hi>reap, if we faint not.</hi> Let this then inſpire us with freſh Vigour, and re-animate us in the noble Struggle for Victory.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs the beſt and moſt effectual Method of carrying on great and laudable Undertakings is by the Union and Cement of Society; by various Lines all tending to one great Center, held together by Charity, the Bond of all Virtues. Nothing can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow truer Satisfaction on a benevolent Mind than to reflect on the many pious and uſeful Deſigns, which have of late Years been promoted by collective P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt may yet be done. Few indeed in theſe our Day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are the Wiſe and Good; and yet ſmall and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as is their Number, were they once hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to unite in the Cauſe of Piety and Virtue, <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace might once more kiſs each other,</hi> and the Triumph over Vice and Irreligion be an eaſy and a glorious Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0325600400:6"/>
To prepare the Way for this Triumph, we are here on this Day aſſembled; to exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Continuance of well-doing, to return our hearty and unfeigned Thanks to God for the good Succeſs we have already met with, and to call down a Bleſſing on our Endeavours; an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Solemnity, eſtabliſh'd by, and very conſonant with, the Piety and Goodneſs of Men engaged in ſo noble and uſeful an Undertaking; a Solemnity, which, it were to be wiſh'd, might be obſerved by all, who ſhall at any Time enter into Purſuits of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>The Foundation of Colonies is perhaps of all Charities the moſt noble and extenſive, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes both public Welfare and private Utility; and whilſt it brings Honour and Plenty to the whole Body, ſecures at the ſame Time the Peace, Safety, and Happineſs of the Individual; it is not narrow and circumſcribed, but embraces the whole Range of ſocial Duties, and takes in our Duty to God, to our Country, and to our Kind.</p>
            <p>What the Pſalmiſt ſays of Children, may I think, with great Propriety, be applied to theſe Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>They are like the Arrows in the Hand of the Giant, happy is</hi> that King <hi>who hath his Quiver full of them;</hi> they give Delight to his Friends, and Terror to his Enemies, and ſerve, like burniſh'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0325600400:7"/>
Armour to the Warrior, both to adorn and to defend.</p>
            <p>Such as promote and encourage theſe glorious Undertakings, are true <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> far better <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> than all the modern Pretenders to Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Apoſtleſhip, which have ſprung up amongſt us. Theſe Deeds and theſe Men will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, when the Zeal of Fools and the Bigotry of Enthuſiaſts ſhall be forgotten. Theſe are the true Patriots and Lovers of their Country, who are thus anxious for her Glory, thus active for her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, <hi>who ſend forth her Fame unto all Lands, and her Words unto the Ends of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> and true Patriots, the Eſtabliſhers of <hi>Georgia</hi> claim our higheſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, Eſteem, and Gratitude; a Colony, which was for a long Time cheriſh'd and encouraged with moſt amazing Warmth and Alacrity; but though the Legiſlature doth continue to encourage it by conſtant Supplies, and tho' thoſe Supplies are fairly and juſtly appropriated by the Truſtees to the Uſes for which they are granted; yet whether it be that public Charity hath ſince emptied itſelf into other Channels; whether, as I before obſerved, the Love of Novelty hath diverted it; whether a falſe Notion may have prevailed that it doth not ſtand in Need of any farther Aſſiſtance; to which ever Cauſe we muſt attribute it, certain it is, it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0325600400:8"/>
doth not at preſent ſo much engroſs the public Care and Concern as it once did, or as it deſerves.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped we are not grown <hi>weary in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</hi> It has ſuffered from us and ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; it has merited from and ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by us.</p>
            <p>On it's Trade and Commerce, on it's Ports and Havens, the Wealth and Safety of a Nation, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as ours is, muſt principally depend. How uſeful <hi>Georgia</hi> hath already been in all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, how much more ſo it may ſtill be render'd, hath already been made ſufficiently evident.</p>
            <p>Undeniable it is, and muſt be, that every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which hath been at any Time alledged in Favour of this Colony, will at this Time recur to us with double Force, whether we conſider it in a civil or in a religious Light.</p>
            <p>When we reflect on the miſerable State of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude and Dependence, in which ſo many amongſt us are involved; the Penury of ſome; the Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others; and at the ſame Time call to Mind that there is a Haven of Reſt open to them; a Place where they may be aſſured of Maintenance and Support, where thoſe Talents and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which might perhaps here lie undiſcover'd, or undiſtinguiſh'd; would be highly valued and eſteem'd; when we conſider that it is thus in the Power of Men to exchange Want and Sorrow for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0325600400:9"/>
Eaſe and Affluence, Infamy for Reputation, and Slavery for Freedom; is it not Matter of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhould yet prefer Miſery to Happineſs, and be in love with Ruin, Poverty and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But there are Thouſands amongſt us, of the low and illiterate eſpecially, who had rather beg and ſtarve here than flouriſh any where elſe; Wretches, who talk with Fear and Trembling of the Miſery of quitting Friends and Home, when at the ſame Time it may be they have neither Home nor Friends to leave.</p>
            <p>Prejudices againſt Places, Things, or Perſons, without Reaſon or Judgment to countenance them, are among the moſt pernicious Weakneſſes of our Nature; they ſhew a fooliſh cowardly Diffidence of ourſelves; a blameable, not to ſay an impious diſtruſt of our Creator, as if his Bounty could not ſupply our Wants in every Climate, his right Hand guide and defend us in every Situation and Circumſtance of Life.</p>
            <p>But the Idle, who are here and will not go over, have another Reaſon alſo, and that is, that the Idle who were there before did not like it; and if the Diſſolute and Slothful have left the Province, (as many of them have) ſo much the better; the Idle in a <hi>Colony,</hi> like Cowards in an Army, are but a dead Weight and an Incumbrance; the Buſineſs is much better carried on without
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0325600400:10"/>
them. If the Members be rotten and corrupt, it is better they ſhould be ſever'd from the Body, leſt they infect and mortify it.</p>
            <p>Such as remain there will in all Probability be more induſtrious and ſerviceable; their Fidelity and Perſeverance ſtand in a ſtronger Point of Light; and ſeem in a more particular Manner to demand your Gratitude towards them.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider <hi>Georgia</hi> in a religious Light. Conſider it as a Shelter from the Tyranny of Bigots and Enthuſiaſts, and as a Door of Knowlege to the unenlighten'd <hi>Barbarian;</hi> as well in Regard to thoſe, who fly from a falſe Religion, as thoſe who are ignorant of the true. Thanks be to God, we are not perſecuted; we are under no Fear of Axes, Faggots, and an Inquiſition; and all our eaſy Taſk is to <hi>love Mercy,</hi> and <hi>walk humbly with our God.</hi> If we do <hi>love Mercy</hi> then, here we may ſhew it; if we ourſelves would <hi>walk humbly with our God,</hi> let us give others an Opportunity of doing ſo too. Perſecution hath already driven many thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who deſerved a better Fate. It is remarked, to the Honour of the <hi>Saltzburghers,</hi> that they live together in the utmoſt Harmony and Happineſs; an amiable Copy of the firſt Ages of the World; in <hi>godly Love and mutual Charity one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> in that Simplicity of Life and Manners, ſo rarely to be met with in any Age, ſo very ſeldom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0325600400:11"/>
in our own. This is furely a State which Kings might envy them. They have Reaſon to bleſs the Hand which perſecuted them, and to look on their Enemies, who drove them to ſuch an Aſylum, as their beſt Friends and Benefactors.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay to the great Advantages, which may ariſe from ſpreading the Goſpel-doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine among the neighbouring <hi>Indians?</hi> Can there be an Employment worthier a good Man, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment capable of imparting more Pleaſure and Satisfaction to a right Mind than that of cultivating and improving the human Soul; to ſoften and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Manners; to tame, by gentle Methods, the Wildneſs of the Savage; and humanize him into a ſocial and benevolent Being; to be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Hands of God of ſaving many Souls from Death; to be the Means of propagating our holy Religion among thoſe, who <hi>have no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of her Laws,</hi> that we may all become <hi>one Flock under one Shepherd;</hi> this is ſurely a moſt noble and moſt deſirable Employment. To this Purpoſe ſome are ſet apart, and to this every one, as far as in him lies, will it is hoped gladly contribute; and if they are rightly taught and inſtructed by us, if we <hi>ſow unto them ſpiritual Things, we ſhall reap their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Things;</hi> they will think no Labour too great, no Toil too irkſome to reward thoſe, who have thus open'd their Minds, and brought them from the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0325600400:12"/>
Darkneſs of Paganiſm and Idolatry to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Surely if there were no other Inducement, this would be ſufficient to prevent our growing weary. The Induſtry of <hi>Rome</hi> in making Proſelytes has long been a Reproach to us; their Warmth and Reſolution make our cold Remiſſneſs ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable.</p>
            <p>It is too common among the Potentates of the Earth to eſtabliſh Colonies by Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; to ſend out Men with Orders to ſeize on the firſt convenient Spot, and take Poſſeſſion of it, after putting to Death all the wretched Inhabitants. This we know has been done; but <hi>Georgia</hi> was not thus eſtabliſh'd; no Property was invaded, no Blood ſpilt; we did not ravage or deſtroy for it; the ſame Methods, which were made Uſe of in the Acquiſition, were alſo follow'd, when we were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in it; and it was originally deſign'd that there ſhould be no ſuch Thing as Slavery in <hi>Georgia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this End, a general Equality was propoſed and acquieſced in, every Man's Eſtate was limited, and no one ſuffer'd by Means of exorbitant Power, or greater Extent of Poſſeſſions, to lord it over, or inſult his Fellow-labourers and Brothers of the Community.</p>
            <p>It was not therefore without great Concern that the <hi>Truſtees</hi> found themſelves under the Neceſſity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0325600400:13"/>
of introducing Negro-ſlaves into the <hi>Colony:</hi> but in this Particular, as in all others, they have, at the ſame Time, acted with the utmoſt Prudence and Humanity. Such Regulations are already made as will greatly tend to promote the Glory of God, and the Good of our Country. Care has been taken to check the Inſolence of Power, to prevent all ſevere Treatment, all Acts of Violence or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that if theſe unhappy Beings muſt eat the Bread of Slavery, they ſhall at leaſt eat it in Peace and Quiet, that their Chains may not gall them, that their <hi>Yoke may be eaſy, and their Burthen light;</hi> and that <hi>their Maſters ſhall,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>give unto their Servants that which is juſt and equal, knowing that they alſo have a Maſter in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To treat our Fellow-creatures, thoſe who partake of the ſame Nature with us, Sons of one common Lord and Father, as Aliens and Illegitimate; to take Advantage of any caſual Superiority, either of bodily or mental Powers, to triumph over and inſult them; is ſurely unworthy of us as Men, and a Diſgrace to us as <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Whilſt, on the other Hand, toenlarge and refine their Souls; to call them from a State of Anarchy and Confuſion to Order and Harmony, to the Benefits of mutual Converſe, and all the protected Joys of Society; and above all, to make them Partakers with us of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0325600400:14"/>
the joyful Hope of another and better World: This is an Ambition worthy of us; this has been your Ambition, may it be crowned with Succeſs.</p>
            <p>The Negroes in <hi>Georgia,</hi> by your late Orders, will be made uſeful not dangerous Subjects; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but not Slaves; dependent, but not miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beings; and it is hoped, an Example ſo truly noble and Praiſe-worthy, will be followed by the reſt of our <hi>Colonies;</hi> that they alſo will act with Humanity and Tenderneſs to all thoſe who are in Subjection under them; that if we call them in to give us their Labour, we ſhall not grudge them in Return Knowlege and Inſtruction; that if they are forced to live among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Care will be taken that they may themſelves in Time become ſo; that if we uſe their Bodies for our Support and Happineſs, their Souls may be refreſhed; and that for their Service here to us, we may beſtow on them, by our Inſtructions, the glorious Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſecuring to themſelves eternal Happineſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>Let us not <hi>then</hi> be weary in well-doing.</p>
            <p>There is doubtleſs now more Encouragement for all that are willing and ready to go there, than there ever yet could be: The Way is become ſmooth and paſſable, and every Obſtacle removed, which could alarm the Timid, or terrify the Bold; the Country rendered more healthful, and more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0325600400:15"/>
Friends ready to embrace and aſſiſt all who will viſit them.</p>
            <p>Whatever Diſappointment the <hi>Colony</hi> may have met with; whatever Diſcouragements may have prejudiced it; thoſe, to whoſe Care it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are intirely Blameleſs: The <hi>honourable Truſtees</hi> have acted always with Integrity and Uprightneſs, with the utmoſt Care and Aſſiduity, and have done all that Men could to ſupport and encourage this good Work, and have the Teſtimony withal of a good Conſcience to inform them that in this, as in all other Things, when they have done what <hi>they can,</hi> they have done what <hi>they ought.</hi> But after all, national Undertakings a Nation muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. To the Public therefore we muſt appeal for Succour if we ſtand in need of it.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>has made Peace within our Borders, and filled us with the Flower of Wheat,</hi> now that <hi>the Plougher plougheth in hope,</hi> now that the Harveſt is ready to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in, now let the Sun of Beneficence ſhine forth upon it.
