            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>LIFE burthenſome, becauſe we know, not how to uſe it. An EPISTLE.</head>
            <l>WHAT, ſir,—a month and not one line afford?</l>
            <l>'Tis well:—how finely ſome folk keep their word!</l>
            <l>I own my promiſe.—But to ſteal an hour,</l>
            <l>'Midſt all this hurry—'tis not in my pow'r.</l>
            <l>Where life each day does one fix'd order keep,</l>
            <l>Succeſſive journies, wearineſs and ſleep.</l>
            <l>Or if our ſcheme ſome interval allows,</l>
            <l>Some hours deſign'd for thought and for repoſe;</l>
            <l>Soon as the ſcatter'd images begin</l>
            <l>In the mind to rally—company comes in:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0509301103:59"/>
Reaſon, adieu! there's no more room to think;</l>
            <l>For all the day behind is noiſe and drink.</l>
            <l>Thus life rolls on, but not without regret;</l>
            <l>Whene'er at morning, in ſome cool retreat,</l>
            <l>I walk alone:—'tis then in thought I view</l>
            <l>Some ſage of old; 'tis then I think of you:</l>
            <l>Whoſe breaſt no tyrant paſſions ever ſeize,</l>
            <l>No pulſe that riots, blood that diſobeys;</l>
            <l>Who follow but where judgment points the way,</l>
            <l>And whom too buſy ſenſe ne'er led aſtray.</l>
            <l>Not that you joys with moderation ſhun;</l>
            <l>You taſte all pleaſures, but indulge in none.</l>
            <l>Fir'd by this image, I reſolve anew:</l>
            <l>'Tis reaſon calls, and peace and joy's in view.</l>
            <l>How bleſs'd a change! a long adieu to ſenſe:</l>
            <l>Oh ſhield me, ſapience! virtue's reign, commence!</l>
            <l>Alas, how ſhort a reign?—the walk is o'er,</l>
            <l>The dinner waits, and friends ſome half a ſcore:</l>
            <l>At firſt to virtue firm, the glaſs I fly;</l>
            <l>'Till ſome fly ſot,—"Not drink the family!"</l>
            <l>Thus gratitude is made to plead for ſin;</l>
            <l>My trait'rous breaſt a party forms within:</l>
            <l>And inclination brib'd, we never want</l>
            <l>Excuſe—"'Tis hot, and walking makes one faint."</l>
            <l>Now ſenſe gets ſtrength; my bright reſolves decay,</l>
            <l>Like ſtars that melt at the approach of day:</l>
            <l>Thought dies; and ev'n, at laſt, your image fades away.</l>

My head grows warm; all reaſon I deſpiſe:</l>

            <l>Betray'd ſo oft, I'm half perſuaded now,</l>

               <l>I muſt be happy, ſure, when I return.</l>
               <l>Whoever hopes true happineſs to ſee,</l>
               <l>Hopes for what never was, nor e'er will be:</l>

               <l>Above, below, acroſs, all ways he tries;</l>
               <l>He tries in vain, 'tis diſcord all, and noiſe:</l>
               <l>Fretting he threw it by: then thus the lout;</l>
               <l>"There's muſick in it, could I fetch it out."</l>
               <l>If life does not its harmony impart,</l>
               <l>We want not inſtruments, but have not art.</l>
               <l>'Tis endleſs to defer our hopes of eaſe,</l>
               <l>Till croſſes end, and diſappointments ceaſe.</l>
               <l>The ſage is happy, not that all goes right,</l>
               <l>His cattle feel no rot, his corn no blight;</l>
               <l>The mind for eaſe is fitted to the wiſe,</l>
               <l>Not ſo the fool's;—'tis here the difference lies:</l>
               <l>Their proſpect is the ſame, but various are their eyes.</l>

               <l>Thy wiſhful warmth her froſty cheek ſhall dye,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Be theſe thy glories. But no more preſume</l>
               <l>That my rebellious heart will yield thee room.</l>
               <l>I know thy puny force, thy ſimple wiles;</l>
               <l>I break triumphant thro' thy ſlender toils.</l>
               <l>I ſee thy dying lamp's laſt languid glow,</l>
               <l>Thy arrows blunted, and unbrac'd thy bow:</l>
               <l>I feel diviner fires my breaſt inflame,</l>
               <l>For active ſcience and ingenuous fame;</l>
               <l>Reſume the paths my earlier choice began,</l>
               <l>And loſe with pride the lover in the man.</l>

               <l>This Beaver on a certain day,</l>
               <l>A friendly viſit went to pay</l>
               <l>To a young couſin, pert and vain,</l>
               <l>Who often rov'd about the plain:</l>
               <l>With ev'ry idle beaſt conferr'd,</l>
               <l>Hearing, and telling what he heard.</l>
               <l>The vagrant youth was gone from home,</l>
               <l>When th' ancient ſage approach'd his dome;</l>
               <l>Who each apartment view'd with care,</l>
               <l>But found each wanted much repair.</l>
               <l>The walls were crack'd, decay'd the doors,</l>
               <l>The corn lay mouldy on the floors;</l>
               <l>Thro' gaping crannies ruſh'd amain</l>
               <l>The bluſt'ring winds with ſnow and rain.</l>
               <l>The timber all was rotten grown,—</l>
               <l>In ſhort, the houſe was tumbling down.</l>
               <l>The gen'rous beaſt, by pity ſway'd,</l>
               <l>Griev'd to behold it thus decay'd;</l>
               <l>And while he mourn'd the tatter'd ſcene,</l>
               <l>The maſter of the lodge came in.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The firſt congratulations o'er,</l>

               <l>And both conſult in peace and war.</l>
               <l>This method (were this method try'd)</l>

               <l>But uncle, uncle, much I fear,</l>
               <l>Some have abus'd the lion's ear;</l>
               <l>He liſtens to the leopard's tongue;</l>

                  <l>And make the faireſt ſtill appear more fair.</l>
                  <l>Beauty can little execution do,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs ſhe borrows half her arms from you;</l>
                  <l>Few, like PYGMALION, doat on lifeleſs charms,</l>
                  <l>Or care to claſp a ſtatue in their arms;</l>
                  <l>But breaſts of flint muſt melt with fierce deſire,</l>
                  <l>When art and motion wake the ſleeping fire:</l>
                  <l>A Venus, drawn by great Apelles' hand,</l>

                  <l>The lifeleſs piece can never warm the heart;</l>

                  <l>Whilſt all her beauteous limbs unactive lie,</l>
                  <l>But when her charms are in the dance diſplay'd,</l>

               <l>A Grove there was, by nature made,</l>
               <l>Of trees that form'd a pleaſing ſhade;</l>
               <l>Where warbled, ever free from care,</l>
               <l>The wing'd muſicians of the air.</l>
               <l>Here tun'd the Nightingale her throat;</l>
               <l>The Thruſh there thrill'd her piercing note;</l>
               <l>The Finch, Lark, Linnet, all agree</l>

               <l>As ſweetly bill'd their time away.</l>
               <l>So cloſely ſeated were the two,</l>
               <l>Together you wou'd think they grew:</l>
               <l>The twig was ſlender where they ſate,</l>

               <l>That he had held a place ſome years,</l>
               <l>He own'd with penitence and tears,</l>

               <l>Neglecting FACTION and her friends,</l>
               <l>He did it not for wicked ends,</l>

               <l>And jarring parties mix in peace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That what he wrote to GILBERT WEST</l>

               <l>Yet there they wrong'd him; for the fact is,</l>
               <l>He reaſon'd for Belief, not Practice;</l>
               <l>And people might believe, he thought,</l>
               <l>Tho' Practice might be deem'd a fault.</l>
               <l>He either dreamt it, or was told,</l>

That it gave breeding no offence,</l>

               <l>If they admitted it, 'twas well,</l>
               <l>If not, he never talk'd of hell,</l>
               <l>Nor even hop'd to change men's meaſures,</l>

               <l>And he's a moſt unchriſtian elf,</l>

               <p>Verſe 29. If we would form an impartial judgment of what is truly honourable, we muſt abſtract all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which regard ourſelves.</p>

               <p>Verſe 180. Falſehood ſhort-lived: Truth eternal.</p>

               <p>Verſe 222. Thus it appears that every one has the power of obtaining true honour, by promoting the happineſs of mankind in his proper ſtation.</p>
               <p>Verſe 226. And thus the love of fame, tho' often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to bad ends, is naturally conducive to virtue and happineſs.</p>

                     <p>It were to be wiſhed that lord Shaftſbury had expreſſed himſelf with greater preciſion on this ſubject: however, thus much may be affirmed with truth.</p>
                     <p>1ſt, By the general tenour of his eſſays on Enthuſiaſm, and the Freedom of Wit and Humour, it appears that his principal deſign was to recommend the way of Ridicule (as he calls it) for the inveſtigation of truth, and detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſhood, not only in moral but religious ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>2dly, It appears no leſs evident, that in the courſe of his reaſonings on this queſtion, he confounds two things which are in their nature and conſequences entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. They are, Ridicule and Good-humour: the latter acknowledged by all to be the beſt mediator in every debate; the former no leſs regarded by moſt, as an Embroiler and Incendiary. Tho' he ſets out with a formal profeſſion of proving the efficacy of wit, humour, and ridicule in the inveſtigation of truth, yet by ſhifting and mixing his terms, he generally ſlides inſenſibly into mere encomiums on good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeding, cheerfulneſs, urbanity, and free enquiry. This indeed keeps ſomething like an argument on foot, and amuſes the ſuperficial reader; but to a more obſervant eye diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a very contemptible defect either of ſincerity or pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion concerning Ridicule may be thus not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſtated: Whether doubtful propoſitions of any kind can be aſcertained by the application of ridicule? Much might be ſaid on this queſtion; but a few words will make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clear to an unprejudic'd mind.</p>
                     <p>The diſapprobation or contempt which certain objects raiſe in the mind of man, is a particular mode of paſſion: the objects of this paſſion are apparent falſhood, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, or impropriety of ſome particular kinds. Thus, the object of fear is apparent danger, or probable approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill. But who has ever dreamt of exalting the paſſion of fear into a ſtandard or teſt of real danger? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign muſt have been rejected as abſurd, becauſe it is the work of reaſon only, to correct and fix the paſſion on its proper objects. The caſe is parallel: apparent or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſhoods, &amp;c. are the objects of contempt, but it is the work of reaſon only, to determine whether the ſuppoſed falſhoods be real or fictitious. But it is ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The ſenſe of ridicule can never be miſtaken."</q>—Why, no more can the ſenſe of Danger.—<q rend="inline">"What, do men never fear without reaſon?"</q>—Yes, very commonly; but they as often deſpiſe and laugh without reaſon. And thus, before any thing can be determined in either caſe, reaſon, and reaſon only, muſt examine circumſtances, ſeperate ideas, decide upon, reſtrain, and correct the paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that the way of ridicule is in fact no more than a ſpecies of eloquence: It applies to a paſſion, and therefore can go no farther in the inveſtigation of truth, than any of thoſe arts which tend to raiſe love, pity, terror, rage or hatred in the heart of man. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his lordſhip might have tranſplanted the whole ſyſtem of rhetorick into his new ſcheme, with the ſame propriety as he hath introduced the way of ridicule itſelf. A hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful project this, for the propagation of truth!</p>
                     <p>As this ſeems to be the real nature and tendency of ridicule, it hath been generally diſcouraged by philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and divines, together with every other mode of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when apply'd to controverted opinions. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, from what is ſaid above, appears to have been rational and juſt; therefore the charge laid againſt divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of lord Shaftſbury (See a note on the Pleaſures of Imagination, Book III.) ſeems entirely groundleſs. The diſtinction which the ſame author hath attempted with reſpect to the influence of ridicule, between ſpeculative and moral truths, ſeems no better founded. It is certain that opinions are no leſs liable to ridicule than actions. And it is no leſs certain that the way of ridicule, cannot determine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety or impropriety of the one, more than the truth of the other; becauſe the ſame paſſion of contempt is equally engaged in both caſes, and therefore (as above) reaſon only can examine the circumſtances of the action or opinion, and thus fix the paſſion on its proper objects.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, this new deſign of diſcovering truth by the vague and unſteady light of ridicule, puts one in mind of the honeſt Iriſhman, who apply'd his candle to he ſun-dial in order to ſee how the night went.</p>
