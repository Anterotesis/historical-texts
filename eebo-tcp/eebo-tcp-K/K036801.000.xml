            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Diſſertation on the armorial Enſigns of the County of</hi> Middleſex, <hi>and of the Abbey and City of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>by</hi> Sir John Hawkins.</head>
            <p>IT has lately been agitated, as a queſtion involving in it ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances reſpecting the hiſtory and antiquities of this kingdom, whether there are any armorial enſigns, or heraldical device, appropriated to the county of Middleſex: A queſtion of ſomewhat the more importance, as the determination thereof will either juſtify or condemn the aſſumption of three <hi>ſabres</hi> or <hi>falchions,</hi> for ſo I muſt at preſent term them, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or cognizance of that county, and the conſequent diſplaying them on the colours of the weſtern regiment of the military corps, maintained by the ſame.</p>
            <p>And here it is firſt to be obſerved, that, in the great weſt window of Weſtminſter Abbey, there are five compartments, the firſt whereof, viz. that on the ſouth ſide contains the device above-mentioned, under a regal crown, or rather a circle with points. This, though by ſome miſtaken for the arms of King Alfred, it may be preſumed refers to Sebert, king of the Eaſt Saxons, for this reaſon, that he was the founder of the church and convent; and that in the time of the heptarchy the ſame was the armorial enſign of the kingdom of the Eaſt Saxons, as may be ſeen, together with the arms of the other kingdoms, in Speed's Chronicle, and alſo in Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's Help to Engliſh Hiſtory, edit. 1773, page 7, with the addition of the terms of blazonry.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be thought, that the three ſabres were the family arms of Sebert; and the family of Seber, who now bear them, attempt to juſtify their claim by this ſuppoſition: but the fact is otherwiſe, it being pretty evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that till of very late times the arms borne by our princes were not their own, if they had any, but thoſe of the kingdom for the time being: even the croſs and martlets, which are reputed to be Edward the Confeſſor's arms, were not peculiar to him or his family. Egbert, the firſt monarch of England, took the croſs as the arms of the kingdom; Alfred added thereto four martlets, and Edward the Confeſſor made them five, by the addition of one at the baſe point; and as to the arms in queſtion, it ſeems that they were borne by Erkenwyne, the firſt of the Eaſt Saxon kings, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>

            <p>It is now time to enquire after the true appellation of thoſe warlike weapons that compoſe the Eaſt Saxon device; and upon conſulting the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors undermentioned, I find that that curved weapon, which I have called a ſabre or falchion, was anciently termed a <hi>Sach,</hi> and there can be little doubt, but that from the conſtant uſe of it in battle the Saxons at large derived their name.</p>
            <p>The following are the ſentiments of ſundry learned etymologiſts on the ſubject:</p>
            <p>Camden, among other opinions touching the denomination, mentions that of its derivation from the word <hi>Saxa,</hi> which he ſays gave occaſion to the following rhyme of Engelhuſius.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quippe brevis gladius, apud illos Saxa vocatur,</l>
               <l>Unde ſibi Saxo nomen traxiſſe putatur.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>The Saxon people did, as moſt believe,</l>
               <l>Their name from Saxa, a ſhort ſword, receive.</l>
            </q>
            <bibl>Introduction to Camden's Britannia, by Bp. Gibſon. Edition 1753. col. 156.</bibl>
            <p>Biſhop Gibſon, the editor of Camden, ſeems to prefer this etymology to the others adduced by his author; and eſpecially to reject that opinion of Michael Neander, that the Saxons came from the Sacae or Saſſones of Aſia, in oppoſition whereto he cites a paſſage from Biſhop Stillingfleet's Origines Brit. p. 305, 306, in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0237100300:4"/>
               <q rend="margQuotes">"However, this original of the Saxons from the Sacae of Aſia may be thought too far fetched, unleſs there were ſome fair hiſtorical account how the Saxons came to be propagated by thoſe Sacae; and no ſuch account being given, it may ſeem to be little more than a poſſibility. Nor may that other original from the ſhort ſwords, called Sachs, ſeem altogether vain, when it is conſidered that the Quirites had their name from Quiris, a ſhort ſpear; and the Scythians from Scytten, to ſhoot with a bow. Tacitus alſo, ſpeaking of ſome of the northern Germans, ſaith, that the common badges they wear are round ſhields and ſhort ſwords; and the arms of Saxony to this day, as Pontanus obſerves, are two ſhort ſwords acroſs."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Junius, in his Etymologicon Anglicanum, Voce Sachs, is more expreſs to the purpoſe, making it to ſignify Cultrum, a knife; Pugio, a dagger, or poniard; and Gladius, a ſword: More particularly he aſſerts, that the SAKS was a kind of ſword, the blade and hilt whereof were nearly of equal length, that it had only one ſharp edge, and was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a knife for cutting meat; and adds, that in his time the Danes uſed the word Saſs for a pair of ſhears. He denies, that the nation of the Saxons derived its name from the Latin, Saxum, as being a hardy, ſtony race, as he ſays has been aſſerted by ſome upon the authority of Iſidore, Lib. IX. Orig. c. 2. On the contrary, he maintains, that it came from thoſe knives which the Germans call Sachs. It farther appears from this author, in <hi>loc. cit.</hi> that the word Sachs has ſometimes been rendered by the Latin appellative Sica, a ſhort ſword or poniard, and he conjectures that the French Scie, a ſaw, may be derived therefrom.</p>
            <p>Sir Henry Spelman, in his Gloſſary, Voce Saxones, cites two lines from Roſwitha de Geſt. Odonum, which ſeem to favor the derivation of Saxones from Saxum. Nevertheleſs, he concurs with Junius; and to add weight to his conjecture, in the next article, viz. Saxo, renders the term by Brevis Gladius, and gives from Gothofredus Viterbienſis the following verſes:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Pax ubi congeritur ſub fraude Macedo veretur,</l>
               <l>Ne malè fruſtretur ſi totus inermis habetur,</l>
               <l>Unde brevis gladios clam tulit arte ſecus;</l>
               <l>Ipſe brevis gladius apud illos Saxo vocatur,</l>
               <l>Unde ſibi Saxo nomen peperiſſe notatur,</l>
               <l>His quoque cultellis vita redempta fuit.</l>

Verſtegan, though a writer of ſomewhat leſs authority than any of thoſe above cited, is nevertheleſs worth conſulting on the ſubject; and the rather, as he elucidates it by the relation of ſundry curious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which he ſums up in a poſitive aſſertion, that the Saxons had their name from this crooked, or ſcythe-like kind of ſword, adding, that he was confirmed in this his opinion by a converſation he once had with Juſtus Lipſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In modern heraldical language, it ſeems, that the weapon above deſcribed is termed a Seax. Vide Blount's Gloſſographia, in Vocibus Saxons et Seax. Phillips's Dict. in Articulo.

                  <p>The particular circumſtances of this ſlaughter are related both by William of Malmeſbury and Geoffry of Monmouth; from the former of theſe, as being of the two a writer of the beſt authority, it may be ſuppoſed that Hollinſhed took that account of it which is given in his hiſtory, Vol. I. p. 117, and is here inſerted:</p>

It ſeems that this kind of weapon was in uſe alſo with the Spartans, for Plutarch relates, that one of that nation being jeſted with for wearing a ſword ſo ſhort, readily anſwered, that it was ſufficiently long to reach the heart of an enemy.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed that the foregoing teſtimonies of the Etymologiſts, do in ſtrictneſs prove no more than that the device of the three Seaxes was a proper and appoſite deſignation of the Saxon people in general, as pointing to a particular circumſtance in their martial oeconomy; and, ſeeing that each of the other ſix kingdoms that made up the heptarchy, had as good a claim to this bearing as the latter, it may be a matter of wonder that the propriety of it did not recommend it to thoſe who had the firſt election.</p>
            <p>To this it may be anſwered, that the queſtion now under diſcuſſion is not, to whom the device now ſpoken of moſt properly belonged, but who were the people that firſt adopted it. This is an enquiry touching a fact, which beſides that it is above aſcertained, may thus be accounted for. The kingdom of Kent was the firſt founded, and the principal of the Heptarchy, and for the cognizance thereof, Hengiſt, who led the Saxons into Britain, diſplayed on his banner a white horſe, in Saxon, Hengſt, in alluſion to his name, and which is even now the bearing of the houſe of Saxony. Ella, the firſt king of the South Saxons, had taken ſix martlets, Cuthred of the Weſt Saxons, a griffin. The Eaſt Saxon king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was next in the order of erection; and for that Erkenwyne made choice of the device of three Seaxes <note n="*" place="bottom">See the arms of the ſeveral kingdoms of the heptarchy in the annexed plate No. I. et ſeq. to No. IX. Upon which it is to be obſerved, that No. VI. and VII. are the arms of Bernicia and Deira, two ſeveral provinces of Northumbria, until Oſwin, king of the former, having ſubdued Deira, and become ſole monarch of Northumbria, took for the arms thereof, <hi>Azure, a croſs between four lions rampant, Or,</hi> as repreſented by No. VIII. Of the province of Deira, from whence Durham, quaſi Deirham, mention is made by Bede, in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, in which, taking occaſion to ſpeak of the converſion of the Saxons to chriſtianity, he relates, that certain captive children being expoſed to ſale in the market-place of Rome, Gregory, afterwards Pope, the firſt of, that name, queſtioned them touching their country, and being anſwered that they were Angli, he reſembled them to angels; and enquiring from what province they came, and receiving for anſwer Deira, he replied in a quibble, leſs witty than benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that they ſhould be freed de Dei ira, from the wrath of God, ſoon after which Auguſtine came hither, charged with a miſſion to teach and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

It is preſumed, that the authorities here cited are abundantly ſufficient to prove, that the three Seaxes blazoned in the colours above deſcribed, were the proper armorial device of the kingdom of the Eaſt Saxons; and when it is conſidered, that the ſame conſiſted of the counties of Eſſex and Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, and part of Hertfordſhire, and that Weſtminſter, ſituated in Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, was the ſeat of its kings, one of whom was the founder of the abbey there; and farther, that this county, from the diſſolution of the heptarchy down to this time, has been the principal reſidence of the Engliſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and the fountain both of juſtice and legiſlature; when theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I ſay, are conſidered, the propriety of aſſuming, as the martial deſignation of the county of Middleſex, the device of that territory of which it made ſo great and reſpectable a part, will hardly admit of a queſtion.</p>

               <p>THE arms of Edward the Confeſſor are in general appropriated to the abbey of Weſtminſter, and are thus blazoned, <hi>Azure, a Croſs fleuré,</hi> or as ſome term it, <hi>pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Upon which it may be obſerved, that they are preciſely the ſame with thoſe of Sebert, king of the Eaſt Saxons, in Norden's Speculum Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae, page 32. Nevertheleſs the arms of the abbey, as they appear on the tomb of Abbot Flaccet, or Faſcet, in the chapel of St. Eraſmus, and alſo among the arms of the mitred abbies in Biſhop Tanner's Notitia Monaſtica are, <hi>Azure, a croſier or paſtoral ſtaff and a mitre in chief,</hi> and ſo are they repreſented in the plate of Weſtminſter Abbey in Newcourt's Repertorium, and in a rude manner in Leland's Collectanea, vol. I. page 100. Vide No. XI.</p>
               <p>The college arms on the wall over the great table in the college hall, and thoſe in a ſhield near it, containing the college arms <hi>party per pale,</hi> with the arms of the dean, biſhop Wilcocks, and alſo in another like the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the great weſt window of the church, are the <hi>croſs and martlets,</hi> and

above them, or in chief, thoſe of France and England <hi>quarterly between two roſes, gules,</hi> agreeing with the deſcription thereof by Sir George Buck, who, in his Treatiſe of the Foundations of all the Colleges, &amp;c. in and about London, printed at the end of Stow's Chronicle, chap. 5. ſays, That the ancient arms of the abbey of Weſtminſter were, <hi>partie per feſſe endente Or and Azure, a croſier erect and a miter in chief;</hi> but that the new arms of the college are partly the arms of Edward the Confeſſor, and partly thoſe of England <hi>in a chief Or, between two red roſes.</hi> Vide No. XII.</p>
               <p>The roſes, as they are red, clearly allude to that badge or cognizance of the houſe of Lancaſter, which with another, viz the <hi>Portcullis,</hi> is to be ſeen on the gates, and almoſt in every corner both within and without, of the chapel of Henry VII. Fuller aſſerts, that the addition of the chief above given, was an augmentation of the ancient conventual ſeal, plainly relating to the enlargement of the church by the erection of Henry the Seventh's chapel, Church Hiſt. Book VI. Page 322, and accordingly they are repreſented on the rods of the vergers, the covers of the common prayer and muſical ſervice-books; and ſuch at this time are the arms of the college as they appear at the ſeet of Saint Peter on the reverſe of the common ſeal of the Dean and Chapter affixed to their leaſes and other corporate inſtruments.</p>
               <p>The arms of the city of Weſtminſter differ from thoſe of the college, and are variouſly repreſented. In the great weſt window of the Abbey, in the extreme compartment toward the north, and alſo in a window on the ſouth ſide of the Broadway chapel, Weſtminſter, they appear as in No. XIII.</p>
               <p>But in the compartment over the ſeat of the chairman in the Guildhall, Weſtminſter, the arms of Edward the Confeſſor take the place in the chief of the arms of England, the roſes occupying the extremities, as is ſeen in No. XIV.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portcullis</hi> ſeems to have been a favourite device of Henry VII. as importing his deſcent from the houſe of Lancaſter <note n="*" place="bottom">He ſeems alſo to have been equally deſirous of declaring by ſymbols his relation to the houſe of York; for beſides the white roſe conjoined with the red in the gates of his chapel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and elſewhere in and about that ſumptuous edifice, there occurs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Falcon in a Fetter-lock, which was the badge or cognizance of Edmund of Langley, duke of York.

In reference to the place and circumſtances of their birth, theſe children aſſumed for their badge or cognizance a <hi>Portcullis,</hi> a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſymbol with the heralds, of a caſtle or fortreſs, and the ſame is at this day the creſt of the duke of Beaufort <note n="†" place="bottom">Henry de Beaufort, duke of Somerſet, the grandſon of the above John de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and whoſe father, Anno 1443, was created duke of Somerſet, dying without lawful iſſue, temp.

               <p>Henry VII. as appears by his pedigree in Rapin, was deſcended from the above ſon of John of Gaunt; wherefore and becauſe that ſon had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>As touching the arms in the great weſt window it is to be noted, that there are five compartments, containing as follows, viz. I. Arms of king Sebert, the founder of the abbey. II.
