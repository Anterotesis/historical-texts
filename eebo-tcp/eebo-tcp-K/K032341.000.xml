            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MR. GARRICK having allowed me, as Miſs Radley's maſter, to chooſe what ſecond part ſhe ſhould appear in, I turn'd my thoughts towards the ballad farce of Damon and Phillida. But when I came to look at it, I not only found that the muſic conſiſted of a great many heavy minuets, and old faſhion'd country-dances, but that there was too much dialogue, without the intervention of airs, which being alſo in blank verſe, rendered the drama ſtill more tireſome, as well as hurt the ſimplicity of ſome of the characters; which, in the idea, were not contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible: add, that the opening and concluſion were extremely flat and un-operatical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0706300200:3"/>In order to remedy the firſt objection, I ventured to reſet ſome of the ballads, intending, out of eſteem for our old me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodies, to let the reſt remain, with the addition only of modern accompanyments; but here again I found the trouble would be equal to new ſetting the whole; and I alſo ſaw, that without the chance of adding any thing to my own little reputation, I might lay myſelf open to cenſure, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to mend, what in the opinion of many people, might want no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons I have compoſed all the ſongs entirely new: and as the piece has never pleas'd upon the ſtage, and for that reaſon has been very ſeldom performed ſince that great actreſs Mrs. Clive was ſo juſtly celebrated in the part of Phillida: I have taken the farther liberty to make ſuch alterations in the drama as I preſumed neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I have thrown the dialogue into proſe, added ſeveral new ſongs, reſtored others
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0706300200:4"/>
from Love in a Riddle, inſerted choruſſes, and, whether for the better or the worſe, made the whole very different from what it has ever yet appeared. With regard to the muſic, I ſhall only ſay, that while I have endeavoured to give light and familiar airs, I have alſo endeavoured to give ſuch as are neither trite nor vulgar.</p>

               <p>Ah, my good Lord, you are our general friend—This is my daughter; I have ever ſtudied to make her happy; and to own the trurh, her chearful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with all my commands, from her infancy, has rendered that taſk a great ſatisfaction to me: now, my Lord, leſt I ſhould die, and leave her in an unfriendly world, I would fain ſee her well married; and for that purpoſe have found her out a pair of well-meaning youths to take her choice of, Cymon and Mopſus here; they are brothers; and their manners ſuit her condition: I am well aſſured ſhe might be happy with either of them, for they both love her ſincerely.</p>

               <p>HOW could the little gipſey carry it off with ſuch an air? I am ſo provoked by her impertinent pride, that I ſhall never reſt in my bed till ſhe lies by me; but let me ſee, are her terms reaſonable? That my heart is ſubdued appears pretty plain; that the object of my love is a worthy one, every ſhepherd confeſſes; that during our laſt converſation, my whole behaviour was diſſimulation, the uneaſineſs I now feel will witneſs for me; what then ſhould I in honor and conſcience do? I have made the appeal, and am ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to call the ſhepherds together, and Arcas at their head, to be witneſſes of my converſion, and my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined reſolution to change the libertine to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man.</p>
