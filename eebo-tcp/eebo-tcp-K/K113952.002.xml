            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Once he was rich—the world eſteemed him wiſe:</l>
               <l>Schemes unaccompliſh'd labour'd in his mind,</l>
               <l>And all his thoughts were to the world confin'd;</l>
               <l>Death came unlook'd for—from his graſping hands</l>
               <l>Down dropt his bags, and mortgages of lands.</l>
               <l>Beneath that ſculptur'd pompous marble-ſtone,</l>
               <l>Lies youthful Florio, aged twenty-one;</l>
               <l>Cropt like a flower, he wither'd in his bloom,</l>
               <l>Tho' flatt'ring life had promis'd years to come:</l>
               <l>Ye ſilken ſons! ye Florios of the age,</l>

               <l>There low in duſt the vain Hortenſio lies,</l>

               <l>Titles and arms his pompous marble grace,</l>
               <l>With a long hiſtory of his noble race:</l>
               <l>Still after death his vanity ſurvives,</l>
               <l>And on his tomb all of Hortenſio lives.</l>

               <l>In memory of the virtues of the dead:</l>

               <l>Here man diſſolv'd in ſhatter'd ruin lies</l>
               <l>So faſt aſleep—as if no more to riſe;</l>
               <l>'Tis ſtrange to think how theſe dead bones can live,</l>
               <l>Leap into form, and with new heat revive!</l>
               <l>Or how this trodden earth to life ſhall wake,</l>
               <l>Know its own place, its former figure take!</l>

               <l>Thro' heaven's expanſe to earth's remoteſt bounds,</l>
               <l>The dead ſhall quit theſe tenements of clay,</l>
               <l>And view again the long extinguiſh'd day:</l>
               <l>It muſt be ſo—the ſame Almighty power</l>
               <l>From duſt who form'd us, can from duſt reſtore.</l>
               <l>Cheer'd with this pleaſing hope, I ſafely truſt</l>

            <l>Come pay me back, ye ſtreams, the drops I lend.</l>
            <l>And you, ſweet Suſan, ſource of all my ſmart,</l>
            <l>Beſtow ſome pity on a broken heart.</l>
            <l>Happy the times, by painful memory bleſt,</l>
            <l>When you poſſeſſing, Robin all poſſeſs'd!</l>
            <l>Paſs'd by your ſide, each day brought new delight,</l>
            <l>And one ſweet ſlumber ſhorten'd every night.</l>
            <l>My play your ſervice, for no toil ſeem'd hard,</l>
            <l>When your kind favour was the hop'd reward.</l>
            <l>I roſe to milking, tho' 'twas ne'er ſo cool;</l>
            <l>I call'd the cows up; I kept off the bull:</l>
            <l>Home on my head I bore the pail upright;</l>
            <l>The pail was heavy, but love made it light:</l>
            <l>And when you ſpilt the milk, and 'gan to cry,</l>
            <l>I took the blame, and ſimply ſaid—'twas I.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0579800302:78"/>When by the haycock's ſide you ſleeping lay,</l>
            <l>Sent by good angels, there I chanc'd to ſtray,</l>
            <l>Juſt as a loathſome adder rear'd his creſt,</l>
            <l>To dart his poiſon in your lilly breaſt,</l>
            <l>Strait with a ſtone I cruſh'd the monſter's head;</l>
            <l>You wak'd, and fainted, tho' you found him dead;</l>
            <l>Then, from the pond, I water brought a-pace,</l>
            <l>My hat brimful, and daſh'd it in your face:</l>
            <l>Still, blue as bilberry, your cold lips did quake,</l>
            <l>Till my warm kiſſes call'd the cherry back.</l>
            <l>When, looking thro' his worſhip's garden gate,</l>
            <l>Ripe peaches tempted, and you long'd to eat;</l>
            <l>Tho' the grim maſtiff growl'd, and ſternly ſtalk'd,</l>
            <l>Tho' guns were loaded, and old Madam walk'd;</l>
            <l>Nor dogs, nor darkneſs, guns, or ghoſts, could fright,</l>
            <l>When Robin ventur'd for his Sue's delight:</l>
            <l>Joyful of midnight quick I poſt away,</l>
            <l>Leap the high wall, and fearleſs pluck the prey;</l>
            <l>Down in your lap a plenteous ſhower they fall;</l>
            <l>Glad you receiv'd them, and you eat them all.</l>
            <l>When fair-day came, I donn'd my ſunday ſuit,</l>
            <l>Bruſh'd the beſt pillion clean, and ſaddled Cutt.</l>
            <l>Then up we got; you clung about my waiſt;</l>
            <l>Pleas'd to be hugg'd, I charg'd you clip me faſt:</l>
            <l>And when you loos'd your hold, and backward ſlipp'd,</l>
            <l>I held your petticoats, and never peep'd.</l>
            <l>The poſied garters, and the top-knot fine,</l>
            <l>The golden ginger-bread, and all was mine:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0579800302:79"/>I paid the puppet-ſhow, the cakes, the ſack;</l>
            <l>And, fraught with fairings, brought you laughing back.</l>
            <l>Suſan but ſpoke, and each gay flower was there,</l>
            <l>To dreſs her bough-pot, or adorn her hair:</l>
            <l>For her the choiceſt of the woods I cull,</l>
            <l>Sloes, hips, and ſtrawberries, her belly full:</l>
            <l>My hoard of apples I to her confeſt;</l>
            <l>My heart was hers, well might ſhe have the reſt.</l>
            <l>And Suſan well approv'd her Robin's care,</l>
            <l>Yes, you was pleas'd; at leaſt you ſaid you were.</l>
            <l>In love's ſoft fire you ſeem'd like me to burn,</l>
            <l>And ſooth'd my fondneſs with a kind return.</l>
            <l>At our long table, when we ſat to dine,</l>
            <l>You ſtretch'd your knees, and mingled feet with mine;</l>
            <l>With fatteſt bacon you my trencher plied,</l>
            <l>And ſlic'd my pudding from the plumby ſide:</l>
            <l>And well I wot, when our ſmall-beer was ſtale,</l>
            <l>You ſtole into the barn, and brought me ale.</l>
            <l>But oh, the ſoldier, blaſter of my hopes!</l>
            <l>(Curſe on pretending kings, and papiſh popes)</l>
            <l>He came from Flanders with the red-coat crew,</l>
            <l>To fight with rebels, and he conquer'd you.</l>
            <l>His doulas ruffles, and his copper lace,</l>
            <l>His brickduſt ſtockings, and his brazen face,</l>
            <l>Theſe are the charms for which you ſlight my youth;</l>
            <l>Charms much too potent for a maiden's truth!</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0579800302:80"/>Soon on the feather'd fool you turn'd your eyes;</l>
            <l>Eager you liſten'd to the braggard's lyes;</l>
            <l>And, ſcorning me, your heart to him reſign,</l>
            <l>Your faithleſs heart, by vows and ſervice, mine.</l>
            <l>True, he is gone, by our brave duke's command,</l>
            <l>To humble Britain's foes in foreign land:</l>
            <l>Ah, what is that? the ſpoiler bears away</l>
            <l>The only thing for which 'twas worth to ſtay.</l>
            <l>But ſorrow's dry;—I'll ſlake it in the brook;</l>
            <l>O well-a-day! how frightful pale I look!</l>
            <l>Care's a conſumer (ſo the ſaying ſpeaks)</l>
            <l>The ſaying's true, I read it in my cheeks.</l>
            <l>Fie! I'll be cheerful, 'tis a fancied pain;</l>
            <l>A flame ſo conſtant cannot meet diſdain:</l>
            <l>I'll waſh my face, and ſhake off foul deſpair,</l>
            <l>My love is kind; alas! I would ſhe were.</l>
            <l>Well ſays our parſon; and our parſon ſaid,</l>
            <l>" True love and tithes ſhould ever well be paid."</l>
            <l>Suſan, from you my heart ſhall never roam,</l>

            <l>The duteous muſe, whoſe haſte officious brings</l>

            <head>THE ADVENTURER AND THE TREASURE.</head>
            <head type="sub">A FABLE.</head>
            <byline>BY MR. CHARLES DENIS.</byline>
            <l>A Knight, we read (tho' authors claſh)</l>
            <l>Once ſallied forth adventures to explore;</l>
            <l>Not as knight-errants did, in days of yore,</l>
            <l>With one ſquire only, and no caſh!</l>
            <l>Our hero, ſo my author ſings,</l>
            <l>Was taught to lay down this poſition,</l>
            <l>That men and money were the things,</l>
            <l>On which depends an expedition.</l>
            <l>He therefore took of both, 'tis ſaid,</l>
            <l>And as along he chas'd for prey,</l>
            <l>To ſuccour dames, and giants ſlay,</l>
            <l>Theſe words upon a rock engrav'd he read:</l>
            <l>" Deep in the earth a treaſure lies,</l>
            <l>" Hid from the light of day;</l>
            <l>" Whoe'er would gain the glorious prize,</l>
            <l>" Thro' me muſt hew his way."</l>
            <l>Away to work they go</l>
            <l>With pick-axe and with crow:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0579800302:100"/>What will not conſtancy atchieve?</l>
            <l>It ſoftens damſels hearts more hard by far</l>
            <l>Than marble, flint, or diamonds are;</l>
            <l>Tho' 'tis what ſome folks can't conceive.</l>
            <l>And now the rock is pierc'd quite thro',</l>
            <l>But yet the treaſure's not the nearer;</l>
            <l>Knight-errants pay for things much dearer.</l>
            <l>For lo! a precipice appears in view,</l>
            <l>Where 'twas inſcrib'd upon a poſt;</l>
            <l>" The money lies on th' other coaſt;</l>
            <l>" Which no adventurer can obtain,</l>
            <l>" 'Till this gulph's levell'd to a plain."</l>
            <l>After much labour, and much coſt,</l>
            <l>The gulph is fill'd, the plain is croſt.</l>
            <l>'Twas time the adventures now were ended;</l>
            <l>For all the money was expended:</l>
            <l>But ſtill new obſtacles ariſe;</l>
            <l>A dragon guards the glorious prize,</l>
            <l>Which by the knight muſt be ſurmounted</l>
            <l>Before the treaſure could be counted.</l>
            <l>I'll try, quoth he, what I can do;</l>
            <l>My purſe is empty—that's too true:</l>
            <l>But I have all my courage left;</l>
            <l>Of that no knight can be bereft:</l>
            <l>When honour calls, I am the man:'</l>
            <l>He ſpoke, and on the dragon ran.</l>
            <l>To paint each blow, and ſtreaming-gaſh,</l>
            <l>From noſe and mouth the ſtreams that flaſh,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0579800302:101"/>Demands the pen that did indite</l>
            <l>The actions of la Mancha's knight:</l>
            <l>We'll ſay then, after many a ſlaſh,</l>
            <l>The dragon lay, as 'twas but meet,</l>
            <l>A breathleſs carcaſe at his feet.</l>
            <l>Not that our hero came off clear;</l>
            <l>The victory coſt him very dear:</l>
            <l>And many a wound left many a ſcar,</l>
            <l>The marks of honour, and th' effects of war.</l>
            <l>At length the treaſure's found—they count it o'er;</l>
            <l>And what d'ye think was in the purſe?</l>
            <l>Penny for penny, leſs nor more,</l>
            <l>The very ſum it had before;</l>
            <l>And well it was no worſe:</l>
            <l>For when contending princes fight,</l>
            <l>For private pique, or public right;</l>
            <l>Armies are rais'd, the fleets are mann'd—</l>
            <l>They combat both by ſea and land.</l>
            <l>When, after many battles paſt,</l>
            <l>Both tir'd with blows make peace at laſt.</l>
            <l>What is it, after all, each nation gets?</l>
            <l>Why—widows, taxes, wooden-legs, and debts.</l>

            <l>Some Cyrus, or Darius, we'll ſuppoſe,</l>

            <l>And yet with eaſe the weight he bore;</l>
            <l>For 'twas his great, and chief delight,</l>
            <l>To break the yoke his vanquiſh'd ſubjects wore,</l>
            <l>And make their burden light.</l>
            <l>Attentive to the voice of the diſtreſs'd,</l>
            <l>Juſtice and virtue flouriſh'd in his reign:</l>
            <l>When, from the confines of his vaſt domain,</l>

            <l>And thus in piteous tragic tone,</l>
            <l>His majeſty addreſs'd:</l>
            <l>" Encourag'd by your fame, I come from far;</l>

            <l>" To act the king, in place of you."</l>
            <l>" I doubt not but all this is true,</l>
            <l>The conſcious prince replied,</l>

            <l>" 'Twas weak to graſp at what you cannot hold,</l>

            <l>Which put Olympus in uproar;</l>
            <l>(Juſt ſo it happen'd once before,</l>
            <l>When on the banks where Simois flows,</l>
            <l>As Homer ſings in times of yore,</l>
            <l>From words their godſhips came to blows)</l>
            <l>When Jupiter aloud exclaim'd,</l>
            <l>" Where's Peace? are ye not all aſham'd,</l>
            <l>" Thus to expoſe yourſelves again,</l>
            <l>" And be the laughing-ſtock of men?"</l>
            <l>Then ſternly look'd the heavens around;</l>
            <l>But Peace was no-where to be found.</l>
            <l>" Haſte, Mercury, thy wings prepare,</l>
            <l>" Fly down to earth, and ſeek her there."</l>
            <l>The god his father's ſummons quick obeys,</l>
            <l>Arrives: and firſt the court ſurveys.</l>
            <l>" Politeneſs lives among the great,</l>
            <l>" And Peace, no doubt, has there a ſeat:</l>
            <l>" Such complaiſance ſmiles in each face,</l>
            <l>" Peace needs muſt baſk in every heart."</l>
            <l>But here the god miſtook the caſe;</l>
            <l>The maſk remov'd, 'twas fraud, 'twas art:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0579800302:105"/>All ready to receive commands,</l>
            <l>Embracing, feigning, ſqueezing hands;</l>
            <l>As fair, and yet as foul as ſin,</l>
            <l>All peace without, all war within.</l>
            <l>He next to Themis' bench his ſteps inclin'd;</l>
            <l>Not that he thought within the hall,</l>
            <l>Amidſt the lawyer's brawl,</l>
            <l>The heaven-born fair to find:</l>
            <l>He turn'd his eyes to that tremendous ſeat,</l>
            <l>Where juſtice ſits with awful air,</l>
            <l>In ſtern majeſtic ſtate:</l>
            <l>But Peace in vain he look'd for there.</l>
            <l>Not even great Hardwick, he whoſe guardian cares</l>

            <l>Whoſe heart, as well as hand, the ballance bears,</l>
            <l>Can quell the clamorous jarring of the laws.</l>
            <l>For law, like Janus, has a double face,</l>

            <l>You take the ſenſe, and leave the letter;</l>
            <l>Or, vice verſa, with as good pretence,</l>
            <l>The letter take, and leave the ſenſe:</l>
            <l>The God was glad to get from hence.</l>
            <l>And to the temples now he goes,</l>

            <l>Peace might with learning dwell, tho' not with wit;</l>

            <l>The public feels my loſs in every heart,</l>
            <l>And with their tears write my renown,</l>

            <l>You build your future fame:</l>
            <l>No doubt but bronze is very hard,</l>

            <l>There's nothing but the poet's lays</l>

            <l>Then tell me, Hayman, brother in Apollo,</l>

            <l>Is not our caſe, who paint or write,</l>
            <l>In all reſpects the ſame?</l>
            <l>Arraign'd by ignorance, and judg'd by ſpite,</l>
            <l>Dubious of praiſe, but ſure of blame.</l>
            <l>In every other ſcience, great or ſmall,</l>
            <l>A jury's call'd of the ſame art and knowledge;</l>
            <l>The ſurgeon is examin'd at the hall,</l>
            <l>The doctor at the college;</l>
            <l>But thoſe who uſe the pencil, and the pen,</l>
            <l>Submit their works to all degrees of men.</l>
            <l>The ſcrivener's clerk, the boy who ſweeps the ſhop,</l>

            <l>But if my friend will liſten to the tale,</l>
            <l>He'll find their ſentence not without appeal.</l>

            <l>A portrait undertook to draw:</l>
            <l>Three ſittings o'er,</l>
            <l>Perhaps ſome more;</l>
            <l>Genius as yet is not confin'd by law.</l>
            <l>'Tis done; the picture is expos'd to view.</l>
            <l>Friends come to judge, as uſual, in ſuch caſe:</l>
            <l>What! don't you know the face?</l>
            <l>Not I indeed; do you?</l>
            <l>'Tis mine, replied the man who ſat:</l>
            <l>Impoſſible! here's neither grace nor air,</l>
            <l>Why this is brown, and you are fair;</l>
            <l>I never ſaw a piece ſo flat.</l>
            <l>Beſides the mouth is all aſkew:</l>

            <l>Pray wipe it out, begin a-new;</l>
            <l>For as it ſtands 'tis quite a fright.</l>
            <l>Our artiſt pleads his cauſe in vain—</l>
            <l>He needs muſt paint it o'er again.</l>
            <l>And now they cry out ten times more,</l>
            <l>Why this is worſe than that before:</l>
            <l>If you would have your portraits take,</l>
            <l>Give us reſemblances that ſtrike;</l>
            <l>That ſeem to think, and want to ſpeak;</l>

            <l>But as for this, there's not one feature like.</l>
            <l>The Virtuoſi gone, the painter ſaid,</l>
            <l>I have a thought, that's juſt come in my head,</l>
            <l>T' expoſe theſe learned friends of yours;</l>
            <l>Who, under name of connoiſſeurs,</l>

            <l>But be ſo kind to join with me,</l>
            <l>And you to-morrow morn ſhall ſee,</l>
            <l>How much they know about the matter.</l>
            <l>Next day the picture was ſet forth to ſight,</l>
            <l>At proper diſtance, and in proper light;</l>
            <l>Juſt as between them 'twas agreed.</l>
            <l>And now the learned meet to ſpeak their mind;</l>
            <l>But ſtill, they can't the leaſt reſemblance find;</l>
            <l>'Twas not their friend—not him indeed—</l>
            <l>" That's very ſtrange, the portrait made reply,</l>
            <l>" Why, gentlemen! 'tis I myſelf, 'tis I."</l>
            <l>For in the cloth a hole was cut,</l>
            <l>Thro' which our man his real face had put,</l>
            <l>To give theſe connoiſſeurs the lie.</l>
            <l>Then are there none, whoſe judgment fix the teſt?</l>
            <l>With taſte and true diſcernment bleſt,</l>
            <l>Whoſe very praiſe rewards the artiſt's toil?</l>
            <l>O yes, no doubt there are:</l>
            <l>Sometimes, tho' very rare,</l>

            <head>ON THE OLD BUST, WITH A SOUR AIR, ON MR. DRYDEN'S MONU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, IN WESTMINSTER-ABBEY.</head>
            <l>AT Dryden's tomb, inſcrib'd with Sh—d's name,</l>
            <l>That mite, ſlow offer'd to eſtabliſh'd fame!</l>
            <l>Fill'd with raw wonder, Tyro ſtopt to gaze;</l>
            <l>And bleſs'd his bounteous Grace, in kind amaze:</l>
            <l>The guardian genius, from the ſacred duſt,</l>
            <l>Re-kindling upwards, wak'd the quickening buſt,</l>
            <l>Glowing from every awful feature—broke</l>
            <l>Diſdainful life—and thus the marble ſpoke:</l>
            <l>" Teach thy blind love of honeſty to ſee,—</l>
            <l>" 'Tis not my monument,—tho' built on me.</l>
            <l>" Great peers, 'tis known, can in oblivion lie;</l>
            <l>" But no great poet has the power to die.</l>
            <l>" At cheap expence, behold engrafted fame!</l>
            <l>" The tack'd aſſociate of a buoyant name.</l>
            <l>" The pompous craft one lucky lord ſhall ſave;</l>
            <l>" And Sh—d borrow life from Dryden's grave."</l>
            <l>'Twas ſaid—and, ere the ſhort ſenſation died,</l>
            <l>The ſtiffening marble writh'd its form aſide:</l>
            <l>Back from the titled waſte of mouldering ſtate</l>
            <l>He turn'd—neglectful of the court, too late!</l>
            <l>And, ſadly conſcious of miſpointed praiſe,</l>
            <l>Frowns thro' the ſtone, and ſhrinks beneath his bays.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>FRiend to my life, and parent of my youth,</l>
               <l>Accept with kindneſs, what I give with truth,</l>
               <l>Accept! and know it undiſguis'd by art,</l>
               <l>Th' o'erflowing fullneſs of a grateful heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While joy returns with this returning morn,</l>
               <l>And thouſands bleſs the day that Poyntz was born,</l>
               <l>Shall I alone no pious wiſhes ſend,</l>
               <l>Forget the patron, and neglect the friend?</l>
               <l>No;—tho' my mind no coſtly preſent prove,</l>
               <l>Exalt my joy, and dignify my love,</l>
               <l>Yet cheerful truth ſhall aid the muſe to pay</l>
               <l>The ſilent tribute of an humble lay;</l>
               <l>Yet gratitude, that heaven-directed fire,</l>
               <l>That muſe ſhall raiſe, that humble lay inſpire,</l>
               <l>Glow in each thought, inſpirit every line,</l>
               <l>And, while it warms my breaſt, enliven thine.</l>

               <l>Does not more real bliſs thy thoughts employ?</l>
               <l>Does not thy ſwelling heart dilate with joy?</l>
               <l>Superior joy, to know thoſe years were ſpent,</l>
               <l>With eaſe and virtue, affluence and content?</l>
               <l>Yes, conſcious honour, with true greatneſs join'd,</l>
               <l>Smiles in thy face, and glows within thy mind:</l>
               <l>In vain, unmov'd by falſe deluding pride,</l>
               <l>The modeſt breaſt would its own merits hide;</l>
               <l>Still, gloriouſly conceal'd, true worth we ſee</l>

               <l>O! could I live like thee, with equal fate,</l>
               <l>Politely good, and innocently great.</l>
               <l>Each noble act, each generous thought, is thine;</l>
               <l>Thoſe acts, thoſe thoughts, to imitate be mine.</l>
               <l>Come thou, my guide, philoſopher, and friend,</l>

               <l>Gay, not preſuming, grave, yet not ſevere.</l>
