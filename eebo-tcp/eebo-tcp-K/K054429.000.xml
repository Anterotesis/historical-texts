            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SINCE PHYSIC alone among all the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſciences, has at this time the misfortune to be <hi>unrepreſented</hi> in Parliament, and as the STATUTE <hi>for preventing Frauds and Abuſes in the making and vending unſound, adulterate, and bad Drugs and Medicines;</hi> is now near expiring, I hope it may not be improper to ſhew the neceſſity of continuing that Act, and to offer ſome Amendments thereto, which the artful evaſions and corruptions of mercenary artificers have rendered abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>Your early acquaintance with the nature and conſtitution of Parliaments, your weight in our national Aſſembly, and your extenſive benevolence, have pointed you out the fitteſt patron and advocate for a Scheme wholely calculated for the public Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to correct the many enormous Abuſes in PHARMACY, and conſequently to promote the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0652202100:4"/>health and temporal happineſs of a conſiderable part of mankind. Therefore I ſhall venture, without any farther apology, to ſubmit the following lines to your ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>There is no well regulated country where the LEGISLATURE has not made ſome proviſion for the preſervation of the health of the <hi>Body natural,</hi> as well as for that of the <hi>Body politic;</hi> yet pity it is, that in moſt, for want of due Information, all the Laws hitherto enacted in regard to <hi>Medicine,</hi> have fallen far ſhort of it's good intentions. For as an Evil whoſe ſource or cauſe is unknown muſt be remedileſs; ſo is it ſcarce poſſible, that the Frauds or Abuſes in any art or trade, tho' ever ſo pernicious to ſociety, can be prevented or puniſhed by law, until they are firſt diſcovered and made apparent to the law-givers.—If ſome of the honeſt artiſts or tradeſmen of every occupation, would ingenuouſly diſcloſe the ſecret corruptions of their reſpective callings (without which they may for ever eſcape the cognizance and cenſure of the LEGISLATURE) we might then hope for a general reformation. But alas! we are too like the <hi>Epheſian ſmith</hi> in ſcripture, ready upon every attempt to purge us from iniquity, to cry out with him, <hi>The craft is in danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The natural, fragile ſtructure of the human Frame, which has rendered it ſubject to ſundry inevitable viciſſitudes, from the force of external bodies, from the alterations of the air, the nature of the aliments, and from the very vital actions, has made the <hi>hecling art</hi> in general, of all others the moſt uſeful and neceſſary for the ſupport and well-being of mankind, and nearly <hi>coaeval</hi> with the Creation<note n="†" place="bottom">Boerh. Inſtit. Medic. Prolegom.</note>. So ſenſible were men in all ages of the uſefulneſs and dignity of Phyſic, that it has ever been held in the utmoſt reverence and eſteem.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0652202100:5"/>The inventors or improvers of this noble art were by the antients ranked among the Gods, and ſtiled ſons of Gods, and the hands of Gods. It was a long time practiſed by heroes only, or the ſons of Gods,<note n="†" place="bottom">Aelian de. animal. lib. ii. cap. 18.</note> being deemed too ſacred for prophane hands. The Heathen, Jews and primitive Chriſtians agreed in paying the utmoſt reſpect to the healing art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it of divine and heavenly origine<note n="†" place="bottom">Cicer. Tuſculan. Quaeſt. lib. 3. Hippoc. de priſ. medicina S. Aug. de Civit. Dei.</note>. Hence we find the greateſt honors poſſible were conferred on the antient phyſicians in the moſt wiſe, polite, and politic ſtates. They were generally careſſed or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by kings and princes who deſigned to ſtudy, and endeavoured to acquire and practice their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable art. Many natural productions as well as artificial preparations to this day retain the Name of a royal diſcoverer or inventor. And two<note n="§" place="bottom">Meſue &amp; Avicen.</note> of the moſt conſiderable antient phyſical writers whoſe works are extant at this time, were, one the ſon of a king, the other a ſovereign prince. The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſo juſtly prized the worth and excellency of the divine <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that they initiated him into their grand myſteries; they preſented him with the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Athens</hi> in a crown, (a royal diadem) to the value of a thouſand pieces of Gold, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled a conſiderable ſtipend for his maintenance during life, at the public expence.—They likewiſe made a law prohibiting all women, bondſmen, or ſlaves meddling with Phyſic: as they did likewiſe in Locris, which decreed, that diſobedience to the directions or preſcriptions of Phyſicians ſhould be puniſhed with death. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> made all Phyſicians that ſhould ſettle in <hi>Rome,</hi> freemen and denizens<note n="‖" place="bottom">Sue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0652202100:6"/>that the firſt alien known to obtain his freedom of that once glorious city was a Phyſician<note n="*" place="bottom">Arcagathus.</note>. The Phyſicians of the college of <hi>Milan</hi> are dignified with an order of knighthood, and wear to this day golden Collars<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. Bapt. Sylvatic.</note>. Innumerable other inſtances might be produced, if neceſſary, to ſhew, that <hi>medicine</hi> and the <hi>medical ſages</hi> were ever reſpected and eſteemed, admired and encouraged, all the World over. See <hi>Celſus,</hi> Senert. <hi>Inſt. Med.</hi> Moaebii <hi>Synopſ. epitom. Inſt.

            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>healing art</hi> was thus honored in the ruder, early ages, how much does it deſerve our regard and attention with the many conſiderable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moderns, which were to the antients utterly unknown?</p>
            <p>There can hardly be any one inſenſible of the value of HEALTH and LIFE, ſince the very firſt impulſe of nature prompts every creature to uſe all ways and means to preſerve them: And nothing but an uninterrupted enjoyment of health can render any man regardleſs of ſo invaluable a bleſſing. It was the dreadful contagion which raged in <hi>Rome</hi> about the 301ſt year after the building that city, where there were not then found Phyſicians enough to attend the ſick<note n="†" place="bottom">Dion. Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>carnaſ.</note>, that firſt made the robuſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſenſible of the Uſe and Excellency of PHYSIC, which they afterwards ſo generouſly incouraged, and ſo amply rewarded. <hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex eſto,</hi> is a precept which was once religiouſly obſerved, in its fulleſt extent, by every worthy <hi>Roman</hi> ſenator. And tho' it might not have been originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced or received in this ſenſe literally, yet I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the application of it merely to the bodily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0652202100:7"/>health of the people, can be no wide deviation from the ſenſe of the wiſe author; ſince the general well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the community depends upon the health of it's Members.</p>
            <p>PHYSIC or MEDICINE is the art by which our lives and health are preſerved and reſtored. And abuſes or mal-adminiſtration in any branch thereof muſt neceſſarily prejudice or ſubvert the whole. This cannot be charged upon <hi>Phyſic</hi> or <hi>Chirurgery,</hi> for it may in truth be affirmed, that this Kingdom was never ſo happily provided in that way, as at preſent, with men of both profeſſions inferior to none in <hi>Europe,</hi> in erudition, judgement, and probity. But PHARMACY, or the <hi>apothecary's art</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which miniſters in an eſpecial manner to the two former branches, namely <hi>Phyſic</hi> and <hi>Chirurgery;</hi> tho' the good ſucceſs of both moſt conſiderably depends thereupon, is leſt neglected and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated, over-run with <hi>errors, abuſes</hi> and <hi>frauds.</hi> And tho' there are no corruptions in any art ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and deſtructive to the public, as thoſe of <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> yet (melancholly conſideration!) none are ſo little liable to diſcovery or puniſhment. Deceits in moſt trades are perceptible to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and are not only in ſome ſenſe cognizable by law, but as they muſt ſooner or later be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the cuſtomers, common policy will direct moſt tradeſmen to ſome integrity in their callings. But as the moſt baneful frauds in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> being never ſuſpected, are ſeldom or never perceptible to the public, tho' often felt, (few or none beſides <hi>Phyſicians, Chirurgeons,</hi> or <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> being ſenſible of the evils in this way,) ſo none tranſgreſſes with more caſe and ſecurity, than the diſhoneſt apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary. He may deſtroy the reputation of the moſt careful and judicious phyſicians and chirurgeons, and murder thouſands of their patients, his bill is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs paid, and he is ſtill unſuſpectedly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, careſſed and employed by the ſurviving Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0652202100:8"/>A little artifice can tinſel or varniſh over the moſt vile <hi>frauds</hi> or <hi>perfidious neglects</hi> of the <hi>unjuſt apothecary.</hi> If he can command a brazen front, with an hardened, ſervile conſcience, it is enough, all is ſafe. For his <hi>vaſſal apprentices,</hi> who only can be privy to his villainy, are huſhed, they are obliged to keep his <hi>ſecrets</hi> without diſtinction.</p>
            <p>AS PHARMACY is a moſt uſeful and neceſſary art, nay, according to one of the fathers of phyſic<note n="†" place="bottom">Celſus. See J. D. Horſt. Inſt. pharmac. L. ii. C. i.</note>, <hi>the moſt uſeful branch of medicine,</hi> when in a ſtate of purity and perfection, ſo it is the moſt <hi>pernicious</hi> and <hi>deſtructive,</hi> when it is not exerciſed with the utmoſt integrity, care, fidelity and good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. No knave ſo vile, ſo dangerous to ſociety as a bad apothecary. The rapacious highwayman, a profeſſed <hi>enemy</hi> to mankind, bids the unwary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller ſtand and at the peril of his life part with his money: But the diſhoneſt apothecary, a more ſubtil kind of robber, pretends a <hi>friendſhip</hi> for his Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet takes the ſame opportunity with the former (which the love of life and health, and dread of death that human Nature is poſſeſſed with, amply affords him,) and ſo robs thouſands of their fortunes, giving them only ſome vile, uſeleſs drug in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; by which their lives are always endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered and often deſtroyed. And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the apothecary is never in the leaſt ſuſpected; ſo that the orphan may oft pay him for the death of his parents, parents for that of their children, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows for their husbands, and ſo forth: and perhaps gratefully acknowledge the great care and tenderneſs of their <hi>worthy apothecary,</hi> tho' he might have been more inſtrumental to their death than the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, the apothecaries have no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral advantages in, nor any incitements to honeſty or integrity in their calling. For while men can buy the moſt baſe and worſt commodities, and may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0652202100:9"/>without detection, ſubſtitute them for, or ſell them at the ſame rate with the beſt and moſt genuine, we ſhall probably be infeſted with ſuch mercenary wretches as will prefer their own ill-gotten gain, to a clear conſcience and the ſafety and welfare of their neighbours; <hi>the far greater profit ariſing from illegal trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not be hereby thought to charge all the worthy apothecaries of this kingdom, with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, diſingenuity, or diſintegrity; far be it from me! I am well aſſured that we have ſome, as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, as ſkilful, and as honeſt in their way, as any in <hi>Europe.</hi> But as it may not be allowable to point at the indentical guilty perſons, either by naming the one, or exempting the other, ſo I am obliged to make the charge in general againſt the whole fraternity, my ſelf not excepted. So <hi>let him whom the cap fits wear it</hi>—<note n="*" place="bottom">Shakeſpear's.

            <p>I have a long time had a conflict with myſelf about this important undertaking.

Thus among the antients, <hi>Medicus ſellularis</hi> implied an apothecary or one who prepared and diſpenſed medicines.

The <hi>Pharmacopolae</hi> of the antients ſeem to have been ſuch as were employed by artiſts in collecting or procuring the ſimples; they were mere venders of drugs, and pretended to no art or knowledge beyond that; but as theſe men in time degenerated into knaves or quacks, they became hateful to ſociety, and the name of <hi>Pharmacopola,</hi> with moſt writers ſince implies, a <hi>canting hawker, a falſe quack,</hi> or <hi>a deceitful mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank.</hi> How applicable this appellation, in the <hi>worſt ſenſe,</hi> may be to ſome <hi>dealers</hi> in <hi>medicine,</hi> who call themſelves <hi>Druggiſts,</hi> I ſhall not here determine; but

            </p>
            <p>So different a profeſſion from <hi>Phyſic</hi> was <hi>Pharmacy</hi> deemed, that not above a century paſſed, ſince the Grocers Company in <hi>London</hi> diſpenſed medicines. But it was at length found expedient, that ſome ſhould ſeparate from that body, who ſhould take upon them the entire management of the medicinal part of that trade, that by applying themſelves ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to an affair of ſo great importance to the public, they might cultivate and attain to a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſo uſeful and neceſſary an art. Whereupon Pharmacy was revived, and the Apothecaries throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off all incumbrances, betook them to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per profeſſion, in which they ſoon became eminent, were taken notice of, and encouraged by the learned, and grew into ſuch favour with King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, that he incorporated them by Royal Charter, and uſed to call them <hi>his own company.</hi> Thus they became a diſtinct ſociety from the grocers.</p>
            <p>The illuſtrious college of phyſicians of <hi>Augſburgh,</hi> which was the firſt, that I find, who took the pains of compiling, and publiſhed the celebrated <hi>Auguſtane Diſpenſatory,</hi> has moſt minutely and juſtly laid down <hi>the qualifications for and the office and duty of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,</hi> from whom, with ſome few amendments from other authentic writers, I make the following abſtract.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As</hi> PHARMACY <hi>is a moſt conſiderable branch of the</hi> HEALING ART, <hi>being the phyſician's chief agent, ſo the apothecary ſhould be a juſt good man, and principally grounded in the knowledge of his profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſhould in general be untainted in his morals, and of a perfect ſound underſtanding, endowed with a juſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the</hi> SUPREME BEING, <hi>and the true principles
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0652202100:16"/>of the</hi> CHRISTIAN RELIGTON; <hi>pious and faithful, juſt and equitable; humane, benign, affable, placable, merciful and ready; mild and bountiful to the poor and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; ever preferring publick to private gains; vigilant and regardful of the dangers and neceſſities of the ſick; in acts of mercy and charity, diligent and unwearied; not covetous, penurious, or mercenary; for in buying of drugs, he is to prefer the teſtimony of a clear conſcience, the good of his neighbour, and his own credit and reputation, to ill gotten riches or lucre. Wherefore, he is to procure ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine good drugs and medicines at any rate, rather than by buying at the vileſt, diſpenſe adulterate or bad medicines, and deceive his unwary cuſtomer to the peril or prejudice of his life or health. He ſhould be ſober and regular in all his conduct; no gameſter, ſot, or drunkard; nor prone to libidinous concupiſcence or venery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe premiſed, his capacity is next to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. <hi>He muſt not only have a ſtrong natural genius to lead him to this art, but he muſt be a good ſcholar, to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to read the ordinary preſcripts of phyſicians and chirurgeons, which</hi> (from the difficulty of tranſlating them with any certainty into the vulgar tongues, and for other obvious reaſons,) <hi>are all over</hi> Europe <hi>wrote in</hi> Latin, <hi>and eſpecially, that he may acquire a thorough knowledge of his profeſſion, by conſulting the works of the learned, who treat upon the ſeveral branches thereof.</hi>

            <p>Among other ſtatutes it is enacted, <q>"That no apothecary, ſhall ſo far ſwerve from his duty, as to interfere with the proper office of a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian or chirurgeon; and that none preſumes to ſell or adminiſter medicines (ſtrong purgatives and provocatives eſpecially) without the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a phyſician; leſt by the raſh, ill-judged, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely uſe of the moſt efficacious remedies, the health of the public may ſuffer, and the beſt medicines fall into contempt and diſrepute; phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians only being the proper judges of the fit ſubjects and juſt times of adminiſtering ſuch remedies." — "The apothecaries are obliged to prepare and compound all their medicines by the college diſpenſatory,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the King's proclamat. prefixed to the <hi>London</hi> diſpenſat.</note> and to ſell them at the rates fixed by the ſenate."

What conſiderable diſcoveries and improvements have already been made in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic in general by theſe diviſions, are very obvious to all that are converſant with the hiſtory of medicine. <hi>Phyſicians</hi> by appointing <hi>proper agents</hi> for the more <hi>operoſe</hi> and <hi>mechanic</hi> parts of their profeſſion, threw off all incumbrance and obtained more time and leiſure for ſtudy. <hi>Chirurgery</hi> was cultivated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame management and both have arrived at the extraordinary pitch of eminence we now ſee them in, under theſe wiſe Regulations. <hi>Pharmacy</hi> too, while it kept within the proper bounds, ſhone and flouriſhed; for it is obſervable, that no ſet of men made a better figure in their way than the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries that retained their integrity and kept within the juſt limits of their Occupation; which the works of many of them amply teſtify.

With him let me remember that great and laborious artiſt and curious naturaliſt, SEBA of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> whoſe prodigious <hi>Muſaeum</hi> with the hiſtory thereof, five large volumes in <hi>folio,</hi> muſt render his memory famous to lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. While <hi>Pharmacy</hi> was practiſed by ſuch able hands as thoſe, <hi>Phyſic</hi> which has ſo great a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon it, muſt have flouriſhed. But ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the inſatiable avarice of moſt of the <hi>apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> that they could not long content themſelves with the ample profit that aroſe upon the ſale of their proper commodities and manufactures; but envious of their elder brethren of the faculty of phyſic, they now endeavoured to imitate them, as the frogs in the fable did the oxen, (and indeed with much the ſame ſucceſs) and ſought after new methods of increaſing their ſordid gains. This they effected by treacherouſly and ſurreptitiouſly invading the provinces of <hi>phyſicians</hi> and <hi>chirurgeons,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0652202100:22"/>alluring the populace under the ſpecious pretence of giving <hi>advice</hi> in phyſic and chirurgery <hi>gratis.</hi> Which fatal deluſion readily inſnared the ignorant vulgar, who could not be ſenſible of their groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and manifeſt incapacity for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, nor apprehend that theſe very bountiful gentry, took care to tax their medicines with their invaluable advice; ſo that their preſcriptions (of which it muſt be confeſſed they are always moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral) are now charged infinitely more than their real value, or what thoſe of phyſicians and chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, (tho' of more intrinſic worth, being certainly better adapted to particular exigencies, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and the indications of cure,) might be made up and ſold for. And thus by iniquitouſly enhancing the prices of remedies and giving them in unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary abundance, they clandeſtinely acquired unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited fees, equal to thoſe juſtly due to the moſt regularly educated and moſt experienced phyſicians or chirurgeons.</p>
            <p>That this is the preſent caſe, every intelligent, candid apothecary muſt confeſs. And theſe fallacies might be further evinced beyond diſpute, were the generality to be made ſenſible of the juſt rates of medicines and the moſt monſtrous, extravagant bills they are frequently charged.

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0652202100:23"/>I have known a gentleman's bill, who ſickened on <hi>Monday</hi> and died the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, amount to above five pounds, tho' his careful apothecary had but a ſtreet's breadth to croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his ſhop and the patient's lodging. It is more than probable, that if the <hi>unhappy ſufferer</hi> took to the value of his bill in medicines, it was the cauſe of his death, and would, tho' he had the moſt athletic conſtitution; but to acquit his apothecary of <hi>this murder,</hi> every one of the profeſſion muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that no man could well require or conſume medicines to that value in the time. Then what phyſician could expect ſo much for his attendance in the ordinary manner for ſo long?</p>
            <p>It muſt be allowed that all artiſts have a juſt right to charge upon their wares, the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and trouble that attend the preparing and vending them; but thoſe of apothecaries in the ſale of their commodities without doors, they have unneceſſarily and unjuſtly brought upon themſelves, for the moſt part; ſo let the world judge their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in impoſing ſuch an iniquitous tax upon the public.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps will in good-nature, urge in favour of their worthy apothecary, <hi>that for a bill of ten pounds he is often put off with five or ſix.</hi> A modeſt, humble creature! His merit as well as demerit, is beſt known to himſelf.—It is true ſome apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries may think themſelves well paid with half their bill, and it is not improbable they often are too well. For while they can ſwell their accounts to what ſize they pleaſe, by the quantities of medicines they preſcribe, and charging what they will, it is likely care will be taken to ſuit the bill to the humor of the cuſtomer, ſo that if he ſhould pay but a fourth part, they are ſure to be no loſers. But which of them will remit one penny of their bill on their own accord, be it ever ſo highly rated, to ſuch as do not wrangle for it? And is not whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0652202100:24"/>ever they receive over and above the real value of the medicines <hi>juſtly</hi> diſpoſed of, the moſt baſe and wicked extortion? — Such <hi>apothecaries</hi> would probably join in the impious breathings of GARTHS <hi>Diaſenna,</hi> if they thought their goods were too low rated.</p>

            <p>The extraordinary, unlimited gain ariſing from theſe horrid uſurpations, has now tempted the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries utterly to forſake their proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate office and duty. For inſtead of purſuing the true means of learning <hi>pharmacy,</hi> (reading the Works of the celebrated writers upon that ſubject, ſuch being generally in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> languages to which moſt dealers in drugs are entire ſtrangers,) they have totally neglected and forſaken it, and in the room of ſuch authors furniſhed themſelves with only ſome vile <hi>Engliſh diſpenſatory,</hi> the deſpicable <hi>cob-webs</hi> of ſome poor illiterate wretch, who quacked for a livelihood and ſpun theſe paultry traps for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, unwary <hi>Flies.</hi> Such were the memorable <hi>ſtar-mongers</hi> and voluminous <hi>quacks, Culpeper</hi> and <hi>Salmon,</hi> and the erroneous, conceited <hi>ſcriblers, Quincy</hi> and <hi>Alleyne;</hi> whoſe <hi>diſpenſatories, practices of phyſic,</hi> and other ſuch like fallacious <hi>quack-books,</hi> (which will not bear reading by any that have read the originals, being calculated only for ſuch mean, illiterate reptiles, as addict themſelves to that vile, pernicious Trade of quacking,) can but prompt a man to think he underſtands phyſic, and practiſe it, when a better education muſt convince him of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0652202100:25"/>contrary, and make him tremble at the thoughts of the ſtupendous task.</p>
            <p>Thus has <hi>Pharmacy</hi> been <hi>perverted</hi> and <hi>debaſed.</hi> For tho' held by the antients <hi>in the ſecond rank,</hi> yet is it now deemed the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>meaneſt</hi> of the three branches; and indeed under the preſent miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and depravity, it may of all trades be reckoned the vileſt and moſt deſpicable; and inſtead of being uſeful, it is become apparently deſtructive to ſociety. A footman or porter may now a-days paſs for an apothecary, we ſee ſhops daily ſerved and attended by ſuch, or ignorant women. I have known an apothecary's ſhop ſerved by a journey man of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mean mechanic trade, who knew not a letter in the alphabet. Nay, a wretch who converſed more with brutes than men; the ſtable-tender or groom of a certain eminent apothecary, has been exalted from rubbing of horſes heels, to attending his maſter's table, and thence to wiping of compters and pounding mortars; and being tranſlated from his maſter's to a ſhop of his own, acquired ſo much craft as to paſs for an apothecary, lived in repute among his neighbours for many years, and died not long ſince in very conſiderable circumſtances. Hence the calling is become ſo vile and ſcandalous, that few, beſides the meaner ſort, put their children to learn it, and ſo contemptible are thoſe after a moſt ſervile and tedious apprenticeſhip, that a journeyman taylor, or ſhoemaker, or any of the meaneſt handy-craft trades, ſhall get better wages than a journey man apothecary, of ever ſo good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in his profeſſion, the moſt ignorant being capable of ſerving moſt of our common ſhops, which conſiſts chiefly in retailing medicines made up by a <hi>nominal druggiſt,</hi> as incapable of preparing, as an <hi>apothecary</hi> of <hi>preſcribing</hi> them juſtly; or bought from a poor, ignorant herb-gatherer, who both frequently ſell one thing for another of ever ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent qualities, which impoſitions are implicitly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0652202100:26"/>over-looked by maſter and man; neither thinking the knowledge of ſimple or compound medicines material, or neceſſary, nor their preparation or compoſition his proper occupation, they lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out for practiſing phyſic and chirurgery; for which as well as their own profeſſion, the reading a falſe <hi>Engliſh diſpenſatory</hi> is reckoned a ſufficient qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification. So, quacking being the principal buſineſs of a <hi>modern apothecary,</hi> he generally goes thro' that himſelf, therefore needs no judicious <hi>emanuenſis,</hi> any raw-boy being ſoon made capable of the ordinary buſineſs of his ſhop; for which reaſon, rather than pay journeyman's wages, apprentices are multiplied at any rate, and at all hazards. Whence we come to have more apothecaries' <hi>ſhops</hi> than any city in <hi>Europe</hi> in proportion: We are within eight or ten equal in number with thoſe of <hi>Paris,</hi> which I think is allowed to be ſix times as populous as <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this fatal degeneracy has now made ſuch a progreſs, that we really forget or know not what we ſhould be. For regardleſs of the worth and dignity of our art and of the public benefit, the apothecaries have neglected and abandoned it, and in the vain purſuit of another, (like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s dog) <hi>quitted the real ſubſtance for an empty ſhadow;</hi> ſo, loſing their art, have dwindled into vile, fallacious quacks, vain and audacious pretenders to phyſic and chirurgery, and deſtructive hawkers of medicine. The very method of educating youth in this calling, is either quite forgotten, or, ſo far perverted and changed from what it muſt have been heretofore, that it is by great accident if ever we happen to ſee any one of common underſtanding in that profeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> few having more than the undeſerved name of <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,</hi> and that only becauſe he lived in ſome mean, ſervile ſtation for a time, with one of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The apprentice of <hi>ſuch a maſter,</hi> begins with a ſmall ſmattering of grammar rules, and ſometimes none; which he (leaſt <hi>Tyro</hi> ſhould ſoon diſcover his ignorance and illiterature, or in time out do him) judges ſufficient.

For altho' he deigns to ſuffer his vaſſal to make up ſome few phyſicians preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (out of pure complaiſance to the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the faculty of phyſic, or inſuperable love of

            <p>I cannot here overlook that moſt abominable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>ſome apothecaries</hi> and <hi>druggiſts,</hi> who not only perſonate one another, by aſſuming the name of their neighbouring brethren, in order to ſteal their cuſtomers, but a certain <hi>audacious quack</hi> has been known to perſonate <hi>a late phyſician</hi> of <hi>his name,</hi> and to recommend himſelf after as an <hi>apothecary.</hi> Theſe baſe artifices lead them to make repetitions of preſcriptions which they never ſaw, being on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's file.

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall beg leave to give one melancholy inſtance of this kind our of many. A certain unfortunate man, who too much confided in the boaſted ſkill of a bold preſumptuous quack, committed himſelf to his care for a certain, ſlight, ſecret diſorder: The apothecary judging it the only way to make a penny of the patient, proceeded to adminiſter medicines <hi>by wholeſale.</hi> For within the compaſs of three months he gave him above forty doſes of mercurial phyſic, with ſundry other coſtly drenches, which brought a conſiderable flux of humors upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part: to which he then made divers unctuous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0652202100:33"/>applications, till at length it became cancerous. Laſtly he had recourſe to ſalivation, but with no better ſucceſs, the patient grew ſenſibly worſe: Yet the Quack to diſpel the growing doubts and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the poor abuſed man, called in a <hi>reputed phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi> to juſtify his mal-practice, and aſſiſt him in the cure. The <hi>doctor</hi> being unable to ſatisfy the unhappy ſufferer in his diſtruſt of the <hi>quack,</hi> he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in better aſſiſtance, and had his life with great difficulty ſaved, by the amputation of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered member. Notwithſtanding all this groſs abuſe of the miſerable patient, this unworthy apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, who may be preſumed to be the principal cauſe of the greateſt evil attending this caſe, makes a moſt extravagant large bill, with a charge of <hi>twenty ſhillings</hi> to his coadjutor the doctor, annexed.</p>

               </gap>y, and bred an utter ſtranger to all parts of his proper calling. By this vile craft he gets his bread, no wonder then he ſhould be firmly attached to it. This is all he learns, all he knows, all he practiſes, all he teaches: And this he finds ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him: He indeed generally takes care to ſecure an intereſt in ſome <hi>party</hi> or <hi>club,</hi> whether <hi>religious</hi> or <hi>politic,</hi> no matter with how little <hi>reaſon,</hi> provided he eſpouſes and defends their principles with a good ſtock of <hi>blind zeal and violence,</hi> he is ſure of the <hi>Society's</hi> favour, ſo he may ſecurely neglect his <hi>true profeſſion.</hi> He therefore employs his whole time in quacking or ſtroling over the town in queſt of prey. For to avoid the dangerous imputation of having nothing to do, <hi>no practice,</hi> (as the phraſe is,) he muſt never be found at home; not to be ſeen in his noiſome ſhop except by accident to preſcribe for ſome ſudden emergency, or perhaps ſometimes to edify by reading over his own <hi>ill-choſen, ſtolen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe's,</hi> there carefully filed more for <hi>ſhew</hi> than <hi>uſe:</hi> That done, he muſt hurry forth, and ruſh thro'
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0652202100:34"/>the ſtreets as if he had ſo many calls, that he cannot tell which firſt to anſwer: While the principal part of his buſineſs, furniſhing the ſhop and ſerving the <hi>wretched cuſtomers,</hi> is left to ſome mercenary <hi>ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druggiſt, a miſerable herb-gatherer, and a raw appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi> The very <hi>Druggiſt,</hi> who in all other nations in <hi>Europe</hi> is but <hi>Pharmacopela,</hi> a mere drug-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, is with us, not only a <hi>phyſician and chirurgeon,</hi> but alſo <hi>a Galenic and Chemic apothecary; a ſeller of druggs, medicines, vernices, oils, paints or colours, poyſons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a Jack of all trades,</hi> and in truth, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of none</hi>—For bad as the uſual education of an apothecary may be, if it could be yet worſe, he may make a good modern druggiſt enough. And it is demonſtrable, that, among the many who aſſume that name, there are not above two in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> that have any right to it. Theſe who are, if poſſible, worſe quacks than the apothecaries, and generally worſe qualified in every reſpect, were the firſt who introduced that blackeſt villainy of ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticating, and debaſing of medicines to gain fame and applauſe by underſelling their honeſt brethren; and you ſhall now find moſt of them ready to make up the preſcriptions of phyſicians and chirurgeons, brought to them by the ignorant vulgar, (who alone indeed intruſt them with ſuch,) at any rate they are offered, even tho' they cannot read them, and tho' they may be compoſed of ſundry medicaments to them utterly unknown. How muſt the unhappy patient and preſcriber ſuffer, whoſe preſcriptions fall into ſuch unworthy hands?</p>
            <p>Thus wretchedly is <hi>pharmacy</hi> taught and practiſed now a-days. How foreign to the manner of the <hi>antient, true apothecaries,</hi> is, I hope, evident from the foregoing; and how contradictory to reaſon, juſtice, and common ſenſe, is, I believe, to every rational unprejudiced man, obvious. Yet, that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fatal miſmanagement, it is, and muſt continue ſo, is, I think, moſt demonſtrable. For a man who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0652202100:35"/>takes the greateſt pains to learn that art, and acquires the moſt extraordinary knowledge, and all the requiſite qualifications therein, and ever ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diligently attends to the <hi>vegular calls</hi> of his profeſſion, and diſcharges the <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>proper office</hi> of an <hi>apothecary,</hi> if he does not moſt audaciouſly and adventurouſly, quack in all caſes without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, he is ſurely deemed but a <hi>blockhead,</hi> and may remain to the generality unknown, and ſtarve: or perhaps have the comfort of being reputed, in his narrow circle of acquaintance, <hi>a good, honeſt fellow, but no apothecary;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>no quack;</hi> and is therefore deſpiſed, becauſe, he has the candor and integrity, not to intermeddle with any buſineſs, but his own, nor to attempt things beyond his ſphere. In ſhort it is not ſuch a man that is <hi>with us</hi> deemed an <hi>apothecary,</hi> no, it is the moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all human beings, a wretch ignorant of all arts, yet pretending to the greateſt; a falſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling ſycophant, that poor, ſhallow mimick, or untowardly ape of a phyſician, chirurgeon and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, the vile, deluding quack! Where then is the encouragement to excel in this art, when the moſt ignorant of it, are, by the generality, preferred, and moſt eſteemed?</p>
            <p>I am well apprized that theſe will appear ſtrange innovations to ſome of the brethren, as well as to thoſe who have not only let the <hi>pretended apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries</hi> into the ſecrets of their families, but alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly committed the care of their health and lives, into ſuch unworthy hands, and ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be blindly, and implicitly governed by them. Yet even thoſe upon impartial examination, and ſerious conſideration, will find them literally juſt and true. It requires no great depth of ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to ſound theſe ambitious pretenders, and to find how unfit and incapable they are, to practice the profeſſion, whoſe name they undeſervedly bear, and how much more that of phyſic and chirurgery.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0652202100:36"/>How many are there among us ſo palpably ignorant, in a moſt material branch of their profeſſed art, as to be daily impoſed upon, not only by their drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt, but even by the ſimple herb-gatherer, who both frequently impoſe upon them, one thing for another, tho' ever ſo different in their nature and properties?

Did not about ſixty apothecaries and druggiſts, oppoſe the <hi>Bill for preventing Frauds and Abuſes in Pharmacy,</hi> and jointly aſſert many groſs abſurdities and falſhoods, and make many moſt frivolous equivocations, in their caſe offered to the Houſe of Peers, in the year 1735? did they not therein call caſtor <hi>a cod,</hi> and caſſia fruit <hi>a cane, like a ſugar cane?</hi> and what leſs than the darkeſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or the moſt conſummate perverſity, could thus prompt them to trifle with ſo auguſt an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly? Did not two apothecaries of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, in the year 1739, advertiſe Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s <hi>medicines,</hi> for ſale, long before the materials could poſſibly be had, or prepared? and did not theſe worthy brethren afterwards employ a certain, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, infamous quack, (once well known <hi>to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and mid-night magiſtrates, to bailiffs, proctors,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0652202100:37"/>church-wardens,</hi> &amp;c.) to vilify him, <hi>whom they only ſuſpected,</hi> to have detected their abominable deceit? In charity, I hope, and am willing to believe, all this, and more, the effects of pure, confirmed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; which, tho' equally pernicious with deſign, there is not at preſent the leaſt proſpect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving: For ſince it is not worth while to ſpend any time or pains, to learn a diſregarded profeſſion, by which ſo little profit is to be gained, as by <hi>true Pharmacy,</hi> (the bare name being enough <hi>to garniſh the quack,</hi> nay, <hi>to dub him a doctor in his own, and the vulgar eyes,</hi>) it can hardly be otherwiſe expected, as the livelihood of moſt apothecaries, now a-days, depends upon their hawking about and quacking with ſuch of their weak, unguarded neighbours, as ſuffer themſelves to fall a prey to their perfidious craft and avarice.</p>
            <p>It is moſt wonderful, and to thoſe who are not thoroughly acquainted with the proper office and duty of an apothecary, inconceivable, what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſtate of depravity and degeneracy the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries of this age are fallen into; and ſuch in time muſt be the caſe of phyſic alſo, from the neceſſary mutual connection of each art, with the other: But moreover, it cannot be long worth any man's while to ſpend <hi>the beſt part of his life, and much of his fortune,</hi> in tedious, laborious ſtudies, deep and accurate reſearches, into the moſt hidden, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote receſſes of nature, when no diſtinction is made between him, and ſo baſe a pretender to phyſic, as an illiterate, unbred apothecary; more eſpecially when it is in the power of ſuch, to prevent his doing the good he ſeeks in his profeſſion, to elude his beſt skill, and fruſtrate all his hopes and intentions of cure, by ignorance, diſhoneſty, or neglect, which muſt ſoon bring him, and the whole art, into the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt contempt.</p>
            <p>But it is yet more ſurpriſing, that theſe very men ſhould ſo far have deceived the public, as to have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0652202100:38"/>their pernicious quacking and tampering, with the health and lives of the people, ſtill countenanced by many perſons (in other reſpects) of good ſenſe, and ſome of the beſt families. To ſee <hi>an hawking apothecary,</hi> that worſt kind of <hi>mountebank,</hi> in dearth of trade, run ſtrolling thro' the ſtreets, gaping for prey, muſt, ſurely move the contempt and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every conſiderate man, who knows <hi>how he ſhould be employed.</hi> Yet purſue him but a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you will find the cringing vagrant, a ſtill greater object of your diſdain.

               <q>"I have ſeen (ſays he) an apothecary in an idle afternoon, go to the houſe of a perſon of quality, who made uſe of him; there happened to be none at home, but children and ſervants, who from the higheſt to the loweſt were in perfect health; if here he came for buſineſs, (you'll ſay) he was diſappointed, but you are miſtaken; the courteous gentleman, with an engaging familiarity, accoſts every ſervant in the houſe, and puts off a purge to the cook, a vomit to the butler, a box of pills to one of the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a pot of <hi>Lucatellus</hi>'s balſam to old nurſe. The children abſolutely refuſing to take any phyſic, at leaſt inwardly, he coaxes little maſter into the uſe of a charming dentifrice, and a ſweet-ſmelling collyrium, to rince his mouth with after it, that ſhall preſerve his teeth, and make them look like ivory, tho' he ſhould eat nothing but ſugar and ſweet-meats all the day long; to pretty miſs, he'll ſend a lotion for her hair, and a (coſmetic) paſte for her hands, that ſhall render one as bright as ſilver, and the other whiter than ſnow; with a beautifying waſh to the maid, that aſſiſted in perſuading them.

            <p>How the more rational and better ſort of people come to acquieſce under theſe heavy grievances, in the moſt tender point, and ſuffer the greateſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in matters of the laſt moment, without ever having even attempted a redreſs, is aſtoniſhing: But as it muſt now be owing to their not knowing the abuſes and cheats, <hi>long cuſtom having made them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,</hi> it is to be hoped, that, when the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof are laid open, every good man will concur in taking ſome meaſures to prevent them for the future.</p>
            <p>Sure there is nothing more inconſiſtent with common reaſon, than the taking apothecaries from their proper office and ſtation!

But if none other evil had aroſe from the taking apothecaries from their occupation, and encouraging them to quack, and thereby to neglect their immediate office and duty, than ſubjecting the public to the grievous tax, of conſuming as much of the apothecaries drugs, and at ſuch a rate, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0652202100:40"/>they think proper, methinks that ſhould have deterred men from it ſufficiently. Should any of the moſt reputable and creditable artiſts, or tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beſides, be employed in furniſhing a family with their goods, will any one ſay to ſuch, <hi>come and ſee me, examine mine houſe, and ſend me as much of your commodities as you think requiſite for me?</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no man, in his ſenſes, could be ſo weak: And yet, why ſhould people repoſe more confidence in apothecaries, than in other tradeſmen, in the like inſtances? they are but men, and altho' there may yet be among them <hi>ſome not unworthy of</hi> Sparta, <hi>in her primitive purity,</hi> yet this is too great a truſt, to be repoſed in mere mortals: For they have ſhops like other tradeſmen, and theſe too furniſhed with <hi>periſhable wares,</hi> which they muſt, therefore, vend the more expeditiouſly: Had they capacities for <hi>practiſing phyſic</hi> or <hi>chirurgery,</hi> they ordinarily have no gratuity allowed them for the ſuppoſed good they do, or for their trouble, but what they procure for themſelves, by charging it on their medicines, which, with giving them in great, unneceſſary abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, they aſſuredly take care of, being left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely their own carvers. And were they as well qualified for that weighty undertaking as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it is hardly to be expected that they ſhould be ſuch <hi>ſaints,</hi> as to refuſe or neglect procuring payment or recompence for their extraordinary labours, or what they call their <hi>art,</hi> eſpecially while it is left at <hi>their option;</hi> the ready way to effect which, is, by ſtuffing the unhappy ſufferer with much nauſeous, and (probably) unneceſſary or improper medicines, even in ſuch ſlight diſorders, as nature, without their impertinent interruptions, could better throw off, by her unaſſiſted powers. — <q>"If a fiſh-monger, or poulterer, (ſays <hi>Mandeville,</hi>) ſhould go to a cuſtomer's houſe after dinner, when the maſter and miſtreſs were abroad, adviſe the ſervants, one to a fine ſalmon, the other to a dozen of turkey
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0652202100:41"/>pouts, and ſend them home accordingly, would you not think them very impudent raſcals?"</q> 
               <hi>Moſt certainly:</hi> And yet the officious quack apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary is equally guilty with either, both having put off their wares, where they knew they were not at all wanting or neceſſary, with this aggravation, that the former gave ſome things uſeful, and of known value, but the latter things entirely uſeleſs, at beſt, of ſmall intrinſic worth; to the taker, of none, unleſs by accident, and perhaps very dangerous and hurtful.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of the groundleſs notions uſually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, <hi>of the skill and judgement of apothecaries, in phyſic and chirurgery, and the cheapneſs of their advice,</hi> is a vain, vulgar prejudice, induſtriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by artful quacks, and their ſervile tools and emiſſaries. From the apothecaries, ſeeing the practice of phyſicians and chirurgeons, in ſundry diſtempers and diſorders, with the great numbers of the preſcriptions of both, which neceſſarily come into their hands, it is inſinuated and imagined, <hi>that they muſt underſtand the whole art of healing in all it's parts, as well as thoſe who have made it their ſole ſtudy and practice, for many years:</hi> And this is the reaſon, why apothecaries are uſually firſt called to the ſick, by which means, they are in fact rendered the <hi>jack-calls</hi> of phyſicians and chirurgeons; in as much as it is manifeſt, that they often make work for both, by multiplying patients, and rendering many caſes worſe, and more inveterate, than when they were firſt conſulted, if the unhappy <hi>ſufferers</hi> have the good fortune to outlive their expenſive, injudicious tamperings for any time.</p>
            <p>It may now perhaps be advanced as heretofore, upon another occaſion<note n="*" place="bottom">See Obſerv. on the phyſician's Bill, 1725.</note>, and it muſt be allowed, <hi>that a thorough bred, experienced apothecary, who knows the faces, qualities, and vertues, of ſimple and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0652202100:42"/>compound medicines,</hi> (to which I muſt add, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands anatomy, and the animal oeconomy, and knows the hiſtories, cauſes, and diagnoſtics of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, without which, he can never be capable of making juſt obſervations on the effects of remedies, or curing diſeaſes,) <hi>may be as ſafely confided in, as the graduate of any univerſity:</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid of an old nurſe-keeper.—It is certain, a gang of <hi>lawleſs thieves and vagabonds,</hi> founded the greateſt common-wealth in the world, and promulged the wiſeſt human laws for the puniſhment and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of vice, and the encouragement of virtue<note n="*" place="bottom">Vertot's Rom. Revol.</note>. But ſure we are not to expect the like from every ſet of <hi>Benditti?</hi> Nor ſuffer any evil to be done, that good may accrue? Why then ſhould the preſent race of apothecaries, who neither have, nor can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the requiſite qualifications of phyſicians, or chirurgeons, be allowed to ſport with the health, lives, and fortunes of the public, at their discretion? When it is evident, they ſhould not be truſted with the care of the ſick, in any diſorder, nor even in their own profeſſion, till they have firſt given open proofs of their underſtanding it. Nothing ſhould induce you to give any men ſuch an unreaſonable, and unjuſt toleration. Our happy conſtitution is ſuch, that no man, or body of men, can make a monopoly of any art, ſcience, or trade: for a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious perſon, ameſnable to the laws, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to profeſs, or practiſe any occupation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. If any man is conſcious of his knowledge, or capacity in medicine, he may preſent himſelf to the college of phyſicians, and ſue for a licence to practiſe, which, having anſwered the proper exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are obliged to grant, they cannot refuſe: So that an apothecary, or any other perſon, found duly qualified, may obtain a licence, to practiſe phyſic: But we find none of our apothecaries have, in any
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0652202100:43"/>inſtance, legally qualified themſelves for ſuch a weighty undertaking, moſt contenting themſelves with no better a <hi>Diploma</hi> than <hi>a ſhop, garniſhed with ſundry empty, painted, and labelled veſſels,</hi> with it's windows <hi>adorned with monſtrous, or ſtrange, uſeleſs animals,</hi> as <hi>tortoiſes, toads,</hi> &amp;c. how then are they to be truſted in matters of ſuch importance? Are they not rather to be induſtriouſly avoided, and juſtly deſpiſed?</p>
            <p>To attain to a competent knowlege in <hi>pharmacy,</hi> and afterwards to diſcharge the <hi>office,</hi> juſtly and faithfully, muſt require more time than <hi>apothecaries</hi> can properly ſpare, who attempt arts, for which they have laid no ſort of foundation: And as none of them, have performed any of the requiſites for <hi>a phyſician,</hi> or <hi>chirurgeon,</hi> and few, or none, even thoſe for an <hi>apothecary,</hi> I think it as arrogant, and as impudent in <hi>an apothecary,</hi> to preſume, to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>phyſic</hi> or <hi>chirurgery,</hi> or to pretend to any skill or judgement in either, as it would be in the moſt illiterate <hi>printer or bookſeller,</hi> to pretend to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics,</hi> or any other branch of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature,</hi> merely becauſe he printed ſundry learned books, in theſe ſciences, for ſale; or, for <hi>a color<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinder,</hi> (to uſe <hi>Mandeville</hi>'s words,) to <hi>painting,</hi> only becauſe he grinds the ſeveral colors, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps prepares the pallate and pencils for his maſter, and ſees him frequently paint. The <hi>apothecary,</hi> it is true, may frequently ſee patients in all manner of diſtempers and diſorders, hear and ſee the moſt judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>phyſicians</hi> and <hi>chirurgeons,</hi> accurately examine their various complaints, may peruſe their ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, nay prepare and adminiſter them. The <hi>printer</hi> likewiſe may ſee the beſt manuſcripts of the moſt celebrated authors in all branches of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> may print and reprint them, and have thouſands of impreſſions to diſpoſe of: And the <hi>color-grinder</hi> alſo, may daily ſee his <hi>maſter</hi> execute his beſt skill and moſt ſublime deſigns in <hi>drawing,</hi> and may (by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0652202100:44"/>his directions) make up and lay out in due order up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pallate, the ſeveral proper colors, and alſo provide the ſeveral neceſſary pencils and tools for <hi>painting</hi> the ſame. And yet, notwithſtanding, each muſt probably remain in the darkeſt ignorance, and continue utter ſtrangers to <hi>phyſic, philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>painting,</hi> until regularly initiated into the <hi>rudiments,</hi> and duly and methodically inſtructed in the <hi>ſeveral rules</hi> of the reſpective arts; and all that ſuch may be ſaid to know in them, are a few technical words, learned by rote or accident, which can ſerve only to impoſe upon the ignorant. Theſe <hi>impoſtors,</hi> it is certain, may ſhine among their kind, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men of ſenſe and learning in other matters for a while, but they can never ſtand the teſt of proper judges. Happy indeed, were it for the public, had the <hi>pretenders</hi> to theſe three arts, been equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to the world. If ſo, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, there would be more <hi>botches</hi> obſerved in the practice of the pretenders to phyſic and chirurgery, (to ſay nothing of downright <hi>murders,</hi> which are uſually hid by the friendly grave-digger) than there are to be ſeen in the <hi>nocturnal works</hi> of the printers of <hi>laſt ſpeeches</hi> and ballads, or in the vile, inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant daubings of the <hi>pretenders</hi> to painting on the paltry ſigns in all the ſtreets in town.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>cheapneſs of the advice of apothecaries</hi> in <hi>phyſic or chirurgery,</hi> it is a moſt falſe and deceitful inſinuation. It's value will beſt appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their qualification. If it appears they have none, as I think it muſt, what is their advice worth? Should it not be avoided as a peſt? I know it is objected by ſome, and made a handle by quacks, <hi>that the fees of phyſicians and chirurgeons are too high,</hi> and <hi>that people in low life, cannot purchaſe their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or advice.</hi> I have in ſome meaſure anſwered theſe objections already,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 31.</note> I ſhall endeavour to obviate them further. It is true, there is no nation in the world
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0652202100:45"/>at this time, that ſo juſtly prizes the merits of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and chirurgeons, or ſo nobly rewards both, as <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> For from our natural freedom, no reſtraint has been laid on rewarding juſt deſerts in any inſtance. Yet notwithſtanding, there are no people in <hi>Europe,</hi> even where fees are loweſt, that may be better attended than thoſe of theſe Kingdoms, did not officious, ſelfiſh quacks inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere.</p>
            <p>There is no ſet of men, who deſerve better of the public, than phyſicians and chirurgeons; none have been and are more publicly and privately beneficent. The extraordinary munificence of Dr. <hi>Radcliffe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hans Sloane</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> of our Sir <hi>Patrick Dun,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stevens;</hi> with many others, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents which muſt atteſt this truth to futurity. And I can affirm on the other hand, that I never met with an object ſo deſpicable, that could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the advice and attendance of numbers of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and chirurgeons of the firſt rank, upon its own terms: And that I have often known phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to refuſe fees from tradeſmen of good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and yet attend them conſtantly for many days after, without any other obligation that that of humanity. Is not this much better than to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to pay rigorouſly the ſmaller fees, and to have the bodies liable to be detained, dead or alive, for payment; as we hear it is in ſome neighbouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Our poor have no reaſon to complain in this inſtance, of any thing mere than the oppreſſion of quacks. The houſes of our phyſicians and chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons are open to, and they are as ready to ſuccour, the poor ſick as the opulent. Are not our <hi>Infirmary</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> attended <hi>gratis?</hi>— It were well for apothecaries, as well as chirurgeons in low life, that none but real objects could partake of theſe Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0652202100:46"/>
            <p n="3">III. I now come to my third head, namely, to lay open ſome of the moſt conſiderable frauds and abuſes of apothecaries and druggiſts, and to point out ſome of the moſt pernicious <hi>ſophiſtications</hi> of <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> with the evil conſequences thereof.</p>
            <p>It is commonly ſaid, <hi>that phyſicians and apothecaries kill more than they cure.</hi>—However ludicrous or ſatyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal this phraſe may ſound, it is a melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the ill-natured ſarcaſm often proves juſt, and is likely to continue ſo, until the <hi>apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and druggiſts,</hi> are brought under ſome proper regulations, which may reſtrain them from <hi>hawking</hi> and <hi>quacking,</hi> and confine them within the juſt limits of their <hi>reſpective callings.</hi> For into ſuch an abyſs of depravity and degeneracy, are theſe men fallen, by their graſping at matters beyond their ſphere; that now (thro' ignorance or diſhoneſty) there is ſcarce a medicine of any worth to be had genuine; the knowledge of many of the moſt valuable ſimples is utterly loſt, and in their room, ſome vile and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign counterfeit, as quacks for apothecaries, foiſted upon the unwary Public. <hi>For corruption by long impunity hardens the offenders, multiplies the number of the guilty, and is now ſo far from being deemed ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> in this way, <hi>that it is really become faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to wilful errors, it may not be impertinent, firſt, to expoſe ſome ariſing from the ignorance and illiterature of apothecaries, being probably the principal cauſes of many more, and which may produce as evil conſequences as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The works of the moſt authentic medical writers, are in <hi>Arabic, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> The beſt known names of diſtempers, as well as of medicines, the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic druggs</hi> eſpecially, are in theſe or ſome other <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Languages,</hi> often <hi>compound;</hi> and moſt of the technical words in medicine, are alſo <hi>compound,</hi> tho' moſtly of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> We do not as yet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0652202100:47"/>know an <hi>Engliſh name</hi> for one vegetable in twenty. For as phyſic took it's origin in the eaſtern parts of the world, and is not as yet truly naturalized to our tongue and idiom; it has hitherto been found ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and difficult, to reduce the <hi>terms of art,</hi> and <hi>names of medicaments,</hi> into any other tongue than the <hi>Latin,</hi> properly and expreſſively, that all the colleges of phyſicians in <hi>Europe,</hi> have not only been obliged to give their diſpenſatories in <hi>Latin,</hi> but in many to admit an entire <hi>Greek</hi> word or phraſe, as being leaſt ambiguous, moſt expreſſive and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. And this is the principal Reaſon for writing, extemporaneous preſcriptions alſo in <hi>Latin.</hi> This made it neceſſary for <hi>apothecaries</hi> to underſtand the learned languages; and they were in all ages ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; until of late, ſome <hi>hirelings</hi> ſprang up, who, finding what a propenſity people had to <hi>quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry;</hi> judged they might ſcribble that way for the vulgar, to gain a livelihood, and ſo preſumed to tranſlate the works of the learned in phyſic, into the vulgar tongue; which <hi>falſe, pretended trannslations,</hi> being ſeldom or never read by any that underſtand the originals, have paſſed with their manifold errors unobſerved to this Day. Among theſe erroneous, hackney tranſlators, the moſt celebrated among the apothecaries at preſent, I may ſay the moſt in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the late famous Dr. <hi>Quincy,</hi> a <hi>Quondam apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> Who it is ſaid <hi>wrote for bread in a Jail.</hi> What right he might have had to annex <hi>M. D.</hi> to his name, I have not yet been able to learn with any certainty; unleſs he followed the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his worthy predeceſſor <hi>Salmon,</hi> who, being called to account for putting theſe letters after his name, upon the ſpecious title pages of his many volumes of fulſome falſhood and nonſenſe, it is ſaid, <hi>declared he did not mean them for Medicinae Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but for Medicamentorum Donator.</hi> In which ſenſe Mr. <hi>Quincy,</hi> and every other <hi>apothecary,</hi> has, no doubt, without leave of an Univerſity, a right to uſe them.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0652202100:48"/>
            <p>The ignorance of the preſent ſet of apothecaries, and their unacquaintance with the learned languages, puts them under a neceſſity, inſtead of obſerving the original <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory, and preparing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing their medicines thereby, as the KING'S <hi>Proclamation prefixed to it enjoins,</hi> to uſe a ſpurious tranſlation of that Diſpenſatory by the aforeſaid <hi>Quincy;</hi> in which he has committed the moſt groſs and dangerous miſtakes. For inſtance, in the Sirup of Marſh-mallows, a compoſition of ſoftening, cooling, pectoral, and diuretic Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Adiantum album &amp; nigrum</hi> (capillary herbs, called black and white Maiden-hairs) <hi>black and white Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebores,</hi> an harſh, draſtic, purgative root, and an acrid and almoſt cauſtic and vomitive one, in the room of mild, ſafe, balſamic Plants, ſo plainly repugnant to the intended virtues of that medicine! He has rendered <hi>ſeſquiunciam,</hi> one ounce and an half, <hi>half an ounce,</hi> even in a compoſition, wherein there are above ſix pounds ſterling difference in the <hi>expence</hi> of that medicine, when diſpenſed by the Diſpenſatory, and the ſame done by his tranſlation; beſides the <hi>virtue</hi> of the remedy's being abated in proportion to what is omitted of the principal ingredient. The ſame author leaves out ſeveral things preſcribed by the College Diſpenſatory, in many compoſitions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits directing the ſeveral parts of ſimples thereby directed to be uſed, and in ſhort, commits many unpardonable errors and omiſſions too tedious to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate, which are ſwallowed implicitly by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and illiterate, to the unſpeakable detriment of the public. In another of his <hi>pharmaceutic works,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">His Praelectiones pharmac. by Dr. <hi>Shaw,</hi> Lect. ix.</note> he teaches the apothecary how <hi>to ſubſtitute,</hi> and gives even a liſt of ſuch things as he juſtifies the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of for others. Among theſe he ſays, that <hi>balſam capivi</hi> may be given for <hi>balm of gilead; ſtyrax,</hi> for <hi>balm of tolu; ſaffron</hi> for <hi>bezoar; bole</hi> for <hi>dragon's
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0652202100:49"/>blood,</hi> for <hi>carthamus ſeed muſtard ſeed,</hi> and other ſuch like ſhocking incoherencies. Yet all theſe, however dangerous and deſtructive to ſociety they may prove, are in ſome ſort excuſable in theſe who could have known no better; at leaſt they are more pardonable than the many wilful frauds and corruptions, which the <hi>apothecaries</hi> and <hi>druggiſts,</hi> have been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to, that like a liar who has told his falſe tale ſo often over, that he at length brings himſelf to believe it truth) they have ſo far hardened their conſciences, as to judge the moſt vile and pernicious counterfeits, not only juſtifiable, but as good as the true and genuine medicines; and ſo have generouſly reduced the prices of many compoſitions, by half leſs than any honeſt man can ſell them. By which means, ſeveral have become ſuch abſolute ſtrangers to the very faces of medicines, that they have been known to reject the genuine, when offered to ſale, and prefer the moſt baſe <hi>ſubſtitutes</hi> or <hi>adulterations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The unparalleled, naked <hi>villainy</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh druggiſts,</hi> which ours, as far as they can, imitate, is the principal cauſe of the many abominable <hi>ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> of medicines. I am well informed, that theſe avaricious falſifiers, who are well verſed in robbing their KING and COUNTRY, were ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and ſo impudent, as to declare, in a Body before the <hi>Britiſh Parliament;</hi> in anſwer to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of a bill, paſſed in the reign of KING GEORGE the firſt, of GLORIOUS MEMORY, <q>"That they did not vend any unſound, or adulterate drugs or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, to the prejudice of his Majeſty's good ſubjects of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> but that all ſuch they ſent to IRELAND"</q>—And they thought, no doubt, their uſeleſs ſcraps and offals, too good for us; becauſe we find by woeful experience, that the latter part of their wicked aſſertion, they daily veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. For tho' the <hi>Britiſh</hi> privy council did this unhappy iſland the juſtice, to retort this anſwer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame worthy ſet of men, when, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0652202100:50"/>of their <hi>Iriſh</hi> correſpondents, they oppoſed the bill, paſſed here, in the year 1735, and ſo, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly recommended it to the Royal Aſſent; yet no means has hitherto been found, to prevent this being the common ſink of all the corrupt, or decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed drugs of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The abuſe of the <hi>draw-back,</hi> given to encourage trade and exportation in <hi>England,</hi> proves now a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt injury to the KING'S <hi>Revenues,</hi> and an inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable impediment to following our trade here honeſtly; which muſt neceſſarily be deſtructive of the health and lives of the people of this kingdom. For the dread of diſcovery, and due puniſhment, upon expoſing bad drugs to ſale in <hi>London,</hi> together, with the advantages ariſing by the <hi>draw-back</hi> upon ſending them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> tho' they were quite rotten and uſeleſs, will always be a motive to infeſt us with the refuſe of all their ſortments, the very <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> of their drugs, nay, the mere <hi>ſweepings</hi> of their drug-ware-houſes. For when a <hi>Londoner</hi> imports a drug, and pays the duty, he removes it to a ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and ſorts it, and what proves ſo unſound or decayed, that he cannot with impunity, or credit, ſell there, he tranſports to <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſwearing it to be within the limited time, and conſigning it to a proper correſpondent. It arrives here, the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent receives it, pays the duty, which (if not taxed in our Book of Rates, wherein moſt drugs are much lower rated than in <hi>England</hi>) it is valued upon oath, by the <hi>Londoner</hi>'s directions, perhaps, not as many pence as it was firſt valued ſhillings; the duty is accordingly paid, and a certificate thereof returned to the <hi>London</hi> tranſporter, who is thereby intitled to draw-back the duty paid at firſt importation, for ſo much as was entered in <hi>Ireland;</hi> except a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not exceeding two and an half <hi>per cent.</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. So that <hi>Rubarb,</hi> whoſe duty upon impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>England,</hi> is ſix ſhillings and ten pence the pound, <hi>draws back</hi> upon exportation about ſix ſhillings
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0652202100:51"/>and four pence, and moſt other drugs in like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this cauſe, the moſt vile drugs, which can eſcape the <hi>examiners</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> are ſent hither; the ſaving the <hi>draw-back,</hi> if they got no more for them here, (where, by the by, a cuſtomer is never wanting for ſuch) being a ſufficient incouragement. This is ſo notorious a practice, that our importers often openly confeſs it, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants are ſo expert at this trade, that they ſend their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents invoyces, with the <hi>draw-back</hi> calculated and deducted from their accounts. I have known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty pounds of damaged Rubarb ſent by a merchant in <hi>London,</hi> to an apothecary in <hi>Dublin,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commiſſion, with directions to ſell it expeditiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for whatever he could. And altho' there was not a ſingle ounce ſound or fit for uſe in the cargo, yet a certain great <hi>druggiſt</hi> bought it, at about a fourth of the then current price of good Rubarb, and dyed it to impoſe upon his cuſtomers.</p>
            <p>Familiar inſtances of theſe abuſes, almoſt every entry of drugs, and I believe of many other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes affords. I ſhall mention but a remarkable one made by a late celebrated druggiſt, about the year 1728. He imported eight hundred weight of Jeſuits Bark, entered it at the cuſtom-houſe, valued upon oath, at a groat per pound. The land-officer,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Craven.</hi>
               </note> ſurpriſed at this ſtrange undervaluation, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quality of the drug; before he would make a ſeizure, (which, if undervalued, he had a right to) adviſed with that faithful, eminent chemiſt, the ingenious Mr. <hi>Maple,</hi> who, upon examining it, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that it was not worth one penny a pound, having not a ſingle characteriſtic of the drugg it was entered for, by which it might be even known.— This inſtance ſhews the cauſe, in confirmation of the obſervations of ſome learned phyſicians,<note n="†" place="bottom">Harris Pharm. Anti-Empir. p. 190.</note> why one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0652202100:52"/>drachm or two of <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> ſucceeded better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, than ſome ounces now a days.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>is the</hi> KING <hi>moſt ungenerouſly robbed of his juſt revenues,</hi> and thus <hi>are the health and lives of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects endangered,</hi> or <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> by the iniquitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Druggiſts,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in their groſs abuſe of that great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to trade, <hi>a draw-back.</hi> And as ſuch vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ſtuff as this is daily imported and ſold by mercenary men among us, who have nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them but their underſelling every fair dealer, it is plain a <hi>faithful apothecary,</hi> who chuſes the beſt commodities at any rate, for the good of his cuſtomers, and his own <hi>private ſatisfastion,</hi> muſt appear a moſt extravagant extortioner to all ſuch as cannot diſtinguiſh the qualities of Medicines, and conſequently, <hi>he cannot expect a livelihood by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if he perſiſts in candor and integrity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the many impoſitions we are liable to in this way from abroad, there are many of our own manufacture equally pernicious to the public, of which give me leave to inſtance but a ſew.</p>
            <p>When Gum <hi>Ammoniac</hi> in the crude, impure maſs is ſold at about ten ſhillings the pound, yet is the <hi>plaſter</hi> (made by diſſolving it in <hi>vinegar</hi> of <hi>ſquills</hi> and <hi>juice</hi> of <hi>hemlock,</hi> ſtraining and boiling it to a proper conſiſtence, in which it loſes very conſiderably of it's weight, beſides the trouble and expence that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily attends the operation) ſo debaſed, as to be ſold for leſs than a fourth of the price of the <hi>Gum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calbanum</hi> has ſuffered the ſame fate. It is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of much the like texture with the former, and muſt be ſtrained or otherwiſe depurated, to render it fit for uſe, by which it ſuffers much the ſame loſs with the <hi>Ammoniac:</hi> Yet notwithstanding, ſo long have people been accuſtomed to <hi>fraud</hi> in this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and ſo familiar is the <hi>ſubſtitute</hi> now become, that the generous, genuine <hi>Gum</hi> is utterly rejected by the good-women and others; and ſo hardened are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0652202100:53"/>the very <hi>falſifiers</hi> grown in this wicked practice, that the <hi>pretended Druggiſts</hi> in effect confeſs it; For I have it under the hand of one of them in a Bill of Rates, <hi>that he ſells the ſtrained for little more than one third of the price of the crude Galbanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So baſe is the counterfeit ſold for <hi>Balſam Capivi,</hi> which is a natural <hi>tear</hi> or <hi>juice</hi> iſſuing upon inciſion of a certain tree in <hi>America,</hi> that it is openly ſold with us for leſs than the <hi>King's</hi> duty upon importation of that drug.</p>
            <p>When ſuch barefaced villainy is committed in the ſimple drugs, what may we not expect in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Medicines? Since the more compound or mixed a remedy is, the better opportunity there muſt be for cheating, by ſubſtituting the baſeſt for the beſt, or leaving out the deareſt and principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in the compoſition, in order to deceive the cuſtomers, and underſell the honeſt compounder.</p>
            <p>To point out all the abuſes in this way, muſt <hi>(alas!)</hi> be no leſs than a comment upon the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory, which would be too tedious and prolix, and by reaſon of the difficulty of comprehending the nature or effects of <hi>frauds</hi> in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> without ſome knowledge in <hi>Phyſic,</hi> as well as a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in that art, I have choſe to mention but ome of the moſt obvious.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Jallap</hi> Root is ſold for ſix or ſeven ſhillings the pound, yet is the <hi>Reſin,</hi> extracted at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and labour, tho' ſixteen ounces of one, will not afford two ounces of the other, ſo vilely ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, as to be ſold by our Druggiſts for two ſhillings an ounce.</p>
            <p>The more compound and expenſive a Medicine is, the more art and induſtry is uſed to <hi>ſophiſticate</hi> or <hi>debaſe</hi> it. Thus the <hi>Treacle of Andromachus,</hi> which takes it's name from the phyſician of <hi>Nero</hi> the <hi>tyrant,</hi> who invented it, and the <hi>Mithridate,</hi> which takes it's name alſo from it's royal author <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of <hi>Pontus,</hi> both which have been received into all the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0652202100:54"/>Diſpenſatories, and ever ſince deemed the <hi>Capital Medicines</hi> in all the ſhops in <hi>Europe;</hi> and of which the wiſe States of <hi>Venice</hi> have taken ſuch ſpecial care in the compoſition, that they are not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed in the republic but under the inſpection of Magiſtrates appointed for that purpoſe, whence the former got the common appellation of <hi>Venice-Treacle,</hi> becauſe for a long time none was reckoned good that was not made there; altho' it is moſt certain, that it may, and has been, as juſtly and faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed and prepared here as there, or in any other place whatſoever: Theſe noble Medicines, which for ſuch a tract of time have ſtood the teſt, and were ever held in the higheſt eſteem, are now fallen into ſuch diſrepute and contempt, through the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>debaſings</hi> and <hi>adulterations</hi> they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, that it is rare to find either ever preſcribed for internal uſe by phyſicians.</p>
            <p>The temptations to <hi>diſhoneſty</hi> are certainly greater in our trade than in any other whatſoever, from the prodigious gains and aſſured ſecrecy that attend our worſt <hi>Deceits.</hi> Moſt are capable of diſtinguiſhing frauds in the ordinary neceſſaries of life; but as ſome <hi>branch</hi> of <hi>medicine</hi> alone can apprehend thoſe in <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> ſo the apothecaries <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or even unſuſpected, openly, eaſily, and ſecurely. Few Medicines have ſuffered more by the hands of diſhoneſt operators, than thoſe (once) juſtly famed compoſitions, juſt now mentioned; the one of which conſiſts of above ſeventy, the other of about fifty ingredients, moſtly very rare, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of the moſt remote parts of the World, and conſequently difficult to be had ſound and genuine; yet are both ſo wretchedly debaſed by mercenary artificers, that they are daily openly ſold for leſs than half the firſt coſt of the true compoſition: Nay, the very inſcription and ſeal, clapt upon the <hi>Treacle</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> by the inſpecting magiſtrates, is now artfully counterfeited in <hi>London,</hi> and put upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0652202100:55"/>pots or caniſters of their own vile manufacture to deceive the ignorant and unwary; and this kind you may ſometimes ſee hawked here as well as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by a pretended <hi>Venetian</hi> ſailor, who perhaps never croſſed the ſeas.</p>
            <p>It is well known to every phyſician and good apothecary, that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Hart's-horn</hi> (properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) conſiſts of nothing more than the volatile Salt, diſſolved in the radical Humidity, and blended with a ſmall portion of the native exalted oil of that Animal, extracted from his horns by fire, according to art; and it's celebrated uſes and virtues are too well known to require any panegyric. Yet this moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Medicine is now ſo baſely <hi>counterfeited,</hi> that the few who have it genuine cannot pretend to ſell it without loſs; being underſold by all the avaricious falſifiers of medicines, who make what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly give that name to, and impoſe upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in it's room, of no better materials than <hi>ſtale piſs, brine, ſoot,</hi> and <hi>roche-lime.</hi> And nevertheleſs this <hi>adulteration</hi> has ſo far gained ground and prevailed, that nothing but the pungent, quick-ſmelling <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>piſs</hi> will go down with the generality, being ſo long accuſtomed to this vile, <hi>excrementitious diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which ſtrikes the ſenſes ſo much more quick and piquant, that they pronounce the other dead or vapid.</p>
            <p>Spirit of <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> is directed to be made with Salt of Tartar; but becauſe lime is cheaper, and affords more ſpirit, it is moſtly uſed for it, tho' the ſpirits raiſed by both are extremely different.</p>
            <p>How unequal the effects of true <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>hart's-horn</hi> and that of <hi>piſs,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> with <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> and that with <hi>lime,</hi> may be upon the human body, I muſt leave to the learned in, phyſic to determine; but this I can ſay from actual obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that true <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Hart's-horn</hi> and that of <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> with <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> are, in their own natures, truly alkaline, and produce a conſiderable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0652202100:56"/>contraſt, or ebullition, upon mixture with acids: <hi>Thoſe</hi> with <hi>lime,</hi> the contrary—whence I think it reaſonable to judge their reſpective virtues and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of acting extremely oppoſite.</p>
            <p>I could lay mine hand upon a certain venerable, antique Gentleman, who occaſionally perſonates a Phyſician or Chirurgeon, an Apothecary, Chemiſt or Druggiſt, and GARTH <hi>'s Colon</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Diſpenſary, <hi>Cant.</hi> ii.</note>,</p>
            <p>In morals looſe, but moſt preciſe in look.</p>
            <p>Who takes a ſhorter and eaſier method of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting theſe <hi>ſpirits,</hi> tho' equally foreign to the true, and, perhaps, equally pernicious with the former <hi>ſophiſtications.</hi> He takes <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> one part, <hi>Pot-aſhes</hi> two parts, and common water a ſufficient quantity to diſſolve the whole: when diſſolved, he ſtrains, and puts one part in a glaſs, falſely labelled, for <hi>ſpirit,</hi> of <hi>Sal Ammoniac,</hi> and the other, tinged yellow, in one, more unjuſtly titled, for <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Hart's-horn;</hi> and ſells both at a moſt exorbitant price, under the reſpective falſe denominations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by the iniquitous uſe of the name of a certain conſiderable Chemiſt before-mentioned, on whom he fathers many other ſpurious compoſitions.</p>
            <p>Unaſſiſted reaſon, without any great knowledge in <hi>Phyſic</hi> or <hi>Chemy,</hi> may ſhew what a contrary effect theſe <hi>cheats</hi> muſt produce, from the genuine medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; and it is not difficult to conceive how both Patient and Preſcriber muſt ſuffer by the uſe of this <hi>horrid impoſture:</hi> For it is evidently but a mere ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of theſe crude ſalts, and conſequently loaden with the cauſtic <hi>Pot-aſhes,</hi> as well as the <hi>marine ſalt</hi> in the <hi>Sal Ammoniac;</hi> both which compoſe a <hi>third kind,</hi> very repugnant to the properties of either <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> or <hi>Hart's-horn,</hi> and which is ſo fixed as not to be raiſed by any degree of fire; whereas
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0652202100:57"/>what is truly <hi>volatile</hi> alone, (which only can anſwer the intentions of thoſe who preſcribe either <hi>ſpirits</hi>) is elevated by the gentleſt heat.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> another admirable remedy, is likewiſe baſely <hi>ſophiſticated.</hi> It is ordered by the learned Authors of the Diſpenſatory we are to follow, to be extracted with ſpirit of <hi>French</hi> wine rectified, firſt diſtilled from <hi>Caſtor, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Lavender Flowers,</hi> and ſome other <hi>aromatic, nervous</hi> medicines, and this is called <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Caſtor;</hi> which muſt undoubtedly render the <hi>tincture</hi> more powerful and effectual for the purpoſes deſigned. Yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, quite regardleſs of it's virtues or effects, you will find the apothecaries great ſtrangers to this medicine. I have heard one of the moſt eminent among them, a man of great reputed honeſty and underſtanding ſay, in the preſence of ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Members of the College of Phyſicians, that this ſpirit is good for nothing, and that brandy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted as good a <hi>tincture</hi> from the <hi>Caſtor.</hi> It muſt indeed be confeſſed, that <hi>brandy,</hi> or the <hi>common, foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, foul, Malt</hi> or <hi>Moloſſus ſpirits,</hi> which are moſt frequently uſed upon this and the like occaſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſpirit of wine, will acquire as deep a color from Caſtor and ſuch like ſubſtances, as the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> or any other ſpirit, of equal ſtrength with them, can do; and that may perhaps ſuffice ſuch as only aim at the baſeſt rate to <hi>counterfeit</hi> the external form or appearance of a medicine, to anſwer their own mercenary ends alone. And we know <hi>deceptions</hi> are attempted in this kind, where the very ſimilitude is wanting: For this ſame <hi>falſe, reddiſh tincture</hi> has been ſold for the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which is pure and limpid.</p>
            <p>I would aſk any candid man, converſant in Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, a few Queſtions, which he cannot, without concern, anſwer. Is it not known, That <hi>common Copperoſe,</hi> a <hi>nauſeous</hi> and <hi>unwholeſome drug,</hi> is ſold for <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> an agreeable, ſafe, and efficacious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and even at a rate but little leſs than that of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0652202100:58"/>the genuine, the better to cover the deceit? That <hi>New-England Caſtor,</hi> tho' vaſtly inferior in virtues, and of a very different make and appearance from the <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> which we are always ordered to uſe, is taken and ſold for that, only becauſe a pound of the former ſeldom exceeds in value one ounce of the latter? That <hi>pot</hi> or <hi>gravelled Aſhes,</hi> of about a groat the pound, is ſold for the <hi>fixt Salts</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> and other <hi>vegetalles,</hi> which are not to be made without great trouble and expence; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the extraordinary difference that appears between them upon experiment<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hoffman.

That <hi>Suet,</hi> or ſome animal fat, but ſlightly impregnated with Mace, is ſold for the <hi>expreſſed Oil</hi> of <hi>Mace,</hi> at leſs than the very <hi>ſpice</hi> can be ſold for? That common <hi>Barbadoes Aloes,</hi> of about twenty pence a pound, is uſed in many compoſitions, and ſold for the <hi>Succotrine Aloes,</hi> worth about eight ſhillings the pound? That <hi>Saffron</hi> is omitted in many medicines wherein it is ordered, or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>baſtard Saffron</hi> uſed inſtead of <hi>Britiſh,</hi> notwithſtanding the greateſt diſparity in their virtues and prices? That <hi>Moloſſus,</hi> or <hi>common Treacle,</hi> is uſed in ſeveral electuaries, and other medicines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Sirups</hi> directed? That common, <hi>white Bryony</hi> Root, bought at about two pence the pound, is mixed with, and ſold for, <hi>Jallap,</hi> worth about ſix ſhillings the pound?

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0652202100:59"/>with, and ſold it for <hi>Sena?</hi> That <hi>Gamboge</hi> is mixed with, and ſold for, <hi>Turpeth Mineral?</hi> That <hi>red Lead</hi> is mixed with the <hi>red,</hi> and <hi>white Lead</hi> with the <hi>white Precipitates</hi> of <hi>Mercury?</hi> And that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> White, or <hi>Whiting,</hi> of about a groat a ſtone, is ſold for <hi>white Lead</hi> which is worth ſo much the pound? and (ſome ſay) even for <hi>Diaphoretic Antimony?</hi> Do not moſt <hi>ſeeds</hi> loſe their <hi>medicinal virtues</hi> with their <hi>vegetative quality?</hi> and yet, are not the ſeeds ſold among us, uſually ſuch, the very uſeleſs ſweepings of Seed-mongers-ſhops? Is not the Vinegar of <hi>Squills</hi> generally made with <hi>green</hi> inſtead of <hi>dry</hi> ſquills, which are ordered by the Diſpenſatory; tho' it is apparent to common reaſon, that they are rather preſerved, than yield their virtues in that manner? and this only, becauſe that root loſes about one half of it's weight in drying? I wiſh I could ſay no more! and I am ſorry to ſay, that every ſenſible man, who has taken pains to learn and pry into the ſecrets of <hi>our Pharmacy,</hi> muſt know theſe and many more, and muſt anſwer theſe <hi>Quaere's</hi> in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to lay before you a ſhort ſketch of the moſt common, <hi>wilful abuſes</hi> of Apothecaries and Druggiſts, which alone may ſhew, how the Diſhoneſt injure the KING <hi>'s Revenues,</hi> impoſe upon the <hi>Public</hi> in general, and prejudice every branch of the <hi>Healing Art,</hi> the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> in particular, the honeſt of whom are grievouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the <hi>fraudulent.</hi> See p. 52.</p>

            <p>When apothecaries become ſuch <hi>obſtinate, hardy malefactors,</hi> what can it tend to leſs than the utter ſubverſion and ruin of <hi>phyſic,</hi> which is ſo connected with, and has ſo great a dependence on, <hi>pharmacy,</hi> that they muſt neceſſarily riſe and fall with each other?—I would aſk the judicious tender phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and chirurgeons, are they not often in more pain than ſome of thoſe they preſcribe for, when they do not know what ſhop their preſcriptions may fall into, on the due preparation of which the health or life of the patient, as well as their credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, depends? How vain and uncertain are all their moſt accurate obſervations on diſeaſes and the effects of remedies rendered by the various diverſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their preſcriptions; when the ſame <hi>recipe</hi> ſhall produce different effects, according to the ſeveral ſhops it has been prepared in?

As for miſchances, thoſe can only fall upon the patient and preſcriber, and if, perchance, he is ſuſpected, as he attends cloſely, and, perhaps, for that end, he ſpeaks firſt, and ſoon acquits himſelf with impunity; and tho' <hi>conſcious</hi> of the <hi>badneſs,</hi> or, at beſt, <hi>uncertain</hi> of the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of his medicines, having <hi>bought,</hi> not <hi>prepared</hi> them, frames many artful excuſes, and never fails to heap the ſcandal of their ill ſucceſs on the defenceleſs preſcriber, which is juſtly due to his ignorance, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, or neglect.</p>
            <p>Bad as the conſequences of the forementioned <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> prove, it were happy they had extended no farther.

Thus likewiſe <hi>Turpentine,</hi> a balſamic exudation from the <hi>Terebinthus</hi> or Turpentine-tree, and even that from the <hi>Larix</hi> or Larch-tree, which is yet more common, and called <hi>Venice-Turpentine</hi> (tho' improperly) is now ſcarcely ever ſeen, and hardly known, among us; becauſe the cheaper <hi>ſubſtitutes</hi> of the <hi>reſins</hi> of <hi>firs, pines,</hi> &amp;c. and their <hi>oil</hi> (which is falſely called, and ſold for, <hi>oil</hi> of <hi>Turpentine</hi>) blended together by fire, is ſold in it's place by the <hi>druggiſts,</hi> vaſtly cheaper than the genuine can be imported for. This vile cheat has been often openly detected in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. An experienced <hi>artificer in frauds,</hi> well verſed in thus counterfeiting the works of Dame Nature, and who produced more Turpentine, in his way, annually, than many of the largeſt trees in the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> territories, had his artifice brought to <hi>light</hi> by his compoſition's taking fire, and burning his and ſome neighbouring houſes in a certain great city;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0652202100:63"/>and tho' he might have juſtly dreaded another fate, yet has he lived to apply to himſelf a phraſe taken from the regeneration of the Phaenix, often miſapplied by canting, falſe chemiſts, <hi>Damnum reparabitur Igni;</hi> which is, indeed, verified. For, that <hi>baſe incendiary</hi> has, by that accident, been raiſed out of duſt, aſhes, and poverty, by the generous (but miſapplied) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the citizens.—We have an account of one that died a martyr to this cauſe in the country<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>It may be thought probable, when men might, in the moſt conſiderable inſtances, gratify their ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful avarice with the greateſt ſecrecy and impunity, that they would not hazard a diſcovery, (tho' there was no law to puniſh them) by a more open tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, which every body may detect: But ſee how a long habit of iniquity, at once obdurates the hearts, and captivates the ſenſes of the feeble, wicked, wretch!</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0652202100:64"/>
            <p>The <hi>apothecaries</hi> and <hi>druggiſts</hi> not content with the faireſt opportunities of <hi>defrauding</hi> the public in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every other reſpect, muſt deceive every cuſtomer, patient or preſcriber, by altering the weights and meaſures directed by ours, and almoſt all other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate diſpenſatories in <hi>Europe,</hi> for I can affirm, that they are not ſmaller in any.</p>
            <p>When a phyſician writes for an <hi>ounce</hi> of any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, he expects <hi>eight drachms</hi> of <hi>ſixty grains</hi> each, according to the table of weights prefixed to the diſpenſatory; but he unexpectedly falls ſhort of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>fifty four</hi> grains. For inſtead of the <hi>medical</hi> the <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>avoir-du-poize</hi> weights are uſed, each ounce of which contains but about <hi>ſeven drachms</hi> and <hi>ſix grains</hi> of the former weight. The evils ariſing from this practice are not in many caſes leſs detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the public, than the frauds and abuſes already mentioned in medicines.</p>
            <p>All the officinal compoſitions, and extemporane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſcriptions, are ſo calculated by the preſcribers, that if duly prepared according to their intentions, they muſt neceſſarily know to the greateſt exactneſs, the quantity of the <hi>principal,</hi> and indeed of every <hi>reſpective</hi> ingredient contained in a doſe, or any given quantity of the mixt medicine. Thus for inſtance, <hi>four ſcruples</hi> of <hi>Venice Treacle</hi> are known to contain <hi>one grain</hi> of <hi>opium, half a drachm</hi> of <hi>the Earl of Warwick's powder, eighteen grains</hi> of <hi>ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and ſo forth. Without knowing this to the greateſt certainty, no man can ſafely preſcribe; for by this rule it is, that all mixt or compound medicines are doſed and preſcribed. But as the weights are now confounded, it is not poſſible for a phyſician to adjuſt the doſe of any compoſition with the leaſt certainty. Suppoſe, for example, an electuary is preſcribed; in every <hi>ounce</hi> of which it is intended there ſhould be <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twenty grains</hi> of <hi>opium,</hi> or of any ſtrong purgative or other active medicine, of ſo great energy, that it required the greateſt accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0652202100:65"/>in the doſing. This electuary inſtead of being diſpenſed by the <hi>proper</hi> weights, is done partly by the <hi>avoir-du-pois</hi> and partly by the <hi>medical;</hi> for the <hi>pounds, ounces</hi> and <hi>half ounces</hi> are of the <hi>former,</hi> but the <hi>drachms, half drachms</hi> and <hi>ſcruples</hi> of the latter <hi>denomination</hi> in our ſhops. So that inſtead of <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twenty grains</hi> in <hi>one ounce,</hi> or <hi>eight drachms,</hi> here is the like number of grains in <hi>ſeven drachms</hi> and <hi>ſix grains</hi> of this electuary: And as the ſame diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion holds in all other compoſitions, the <hi>grains not varying in any weights,</hi> ſo the phyſician in this reſpect too, is expoſed to the moſt dangerous <hi>decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for his patients muſt be frequently <hi>over doſed</hi> in the chief, active ingredients in his preſcriptions, and in the more ſimple, <hi>under doſed,</hi> as every ounce given wants almoſt one eighth. This dire confuſion increaſes with the weights; for the <hi>medical pound</hi> is above <hi>two ounces</hi> l ghter than the <hi>avoir-du-pois</hi> What a doubtful, inconſiſtent medley muſt ſuch compoſitions be, as are diſpenſed thus unjuſtly and irregularly?</p>
            <p>The ſame irregularity has likewiſe confuſed the <hi>medical meaſures;</hi> which are <hi>gallons, pints</hi> or <hi>pounds,</hi> and <hi>ounces,</hi> uſed in the diſpenſation of certain liquids. For tho' <hi>apothecaries</hi> may have <hi>juſt ounce meaſures,</hi> yet if <hi>four ounces</hi> of any ſimple water are preſcribed, the <hi>naggin</hi> is moſt commonly uſed, which wants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an ounce of the intended, <hi>juſt meaſure.</hi> This is of the ſame conſequence with the errors in weights; as <hi>laudanum, opium,</hi> &amp;c. which are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are often intended to be conveyed in proper doſes, in certain proportions of juleps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are <hi>moſtly meaſured.</hi>—How unlikely then is the beſt phyſician to cure his patients, when tho' he ſhould get good medicines, which is above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to one againſt him, yet they are aſſuredly not diſpenſed by the <hi>weights</hi> or <hi>meaſures</hi> he expects or intends: So that it is great odds, his preſcriptions are by this means too frequently abuſed or miſapplied!</p>
            <p>One thing more (tho' out of place) I muſt here
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0652202100:66"/>obſerve <hi>my brethren</hi> yet to blame in, and that is the unprecedented, evil cuſtom of keeping ſeveral <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive poiſons</hi> and <hi>poiſonous drugs,</hi> not at all uſed in medicine, promiſcuous in their ſhops, with ſundry other drugs of great and near reſemblance in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſpect; which are often handled, weighed in the ſame ſcales, powdered or otherwiſe prepared in the ſame mortars or other utenſils, and upon the ſame compters, where divers medicines are handled, weighed or prepared.</p>
            <p>Inſatiable avarice, which begot an inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of extending the profeſſion of pharmacy, to graſp at things out of it's way and reach, for the ſake of lucre; firſt made apothecaries <hi>poiſoners</hi> in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and probably the words <hi>pharmacus,</hi> and <hi>pharmacum,</hi> ſynonymous for <hi>apothecary, villain</hi> or <hi>poiſoner, remedy</hi> or <hi>poiſon.</hi>—Sure no man can be inſenſible of the dire effects of handling or keeping poiſons near medicines, when it is notorious that the baneful duſt of ſuch, nay the very <hi>effluvia</hi> of ſome, contaminate the very ambient air, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently every thing it touches. Can it be from any other cauſe than their too near vicinity to the <hi>factitious Arſenic</hi> boxes, that ſo mild and inoffenſive things as <hi>burnt Heart's horn</hi> and <hi>cream of Tartar</hi> have often induced the moſt dreadful ſickneſs and vomitings, and to ſome proved deadly? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the cream of Tartar is adulterated, as we have too much reaſon to doubt, with <hi>Willis, Riverius,</hi> and <hi>Harris</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pharmacolog. anti-empiric, p. 150. &amp; ſeq.</note>. Have we not had many melancholy inſtances of fatal miſcarriages in this way, from ſuch ſhops as deal in poiſons? And if theſe do not convince the <hi>mercenary apothecaries and druggiſts</hi> of their <hi>errors,</hi> and diſsuade them from this dangerous practice for the future, the force of reaſon will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably prove fruitleſs, and we may expect relief in this, as well as the forementioned grievances, from nothing leſs than a ſevere, rigorous law.</p>
            <p>No <hi>apothecary</hi> or <hi>druggiſt</hi> in <hi>London</hi> tranſgreſſes in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0652202100:67"/>this inſtance. <hi>Color-ſelling</hi> there, is a quite diſtinct branch of trade: And the <hi>color-men</hi> who profeſs that alone, are as ignorant of medicinal drugs (if poſſible) as any of our <hi>pretended apothecaries</hi> or <hi>druggiſts.</hi> This gives them more leiſure, and makes them more careful and ſolicitous to improve, and cultivate that buſineſs. Whence we find the <hi>colors, oils, vernices,</hi> &amp;c. are with them properly treated, and ſo to be had pure and good in their kind: which is more than our <hi>color-men</hi> can ſay for theſe or any of their proper commodities.</p>
            <p>If <hi>apothecaries</hi> and <hi>druggiſts</hi> had not fallen into a moſt abject ſtate of ſloth and ſtupidity, it would not have been neceſſary to make this <hi>ſecond applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to PARLIAMENT, for laws to reſtrain them from this <hi>manifeſt evil</hi> at leaſt.

            <p>I ſhall now cloſe this ſection with one ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
            <p>If this <hi>curſed apoſtacy,</hi> this <hi>fatal degeneracy,</hi> which we here complain of, and moſt earneſtly deſire to be reformed, had tended to no worſe an evil, than the <hi>ruin</hi> and <hi>ſubverſion</hi> of one of the <hi>moſt antient, noble</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> ARTS, to ſay nothing of it's bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's eldeſt twin-ſiſter, PHYSIC (which muſt neceſſarily riſe and fall with it) to the ground, and was not attended with that diſmal train of evil conſequences to mankind in general which we daily diſcover, ſure the vile <hi>miſcreants</hi> who have brought it to this low paſs, and rendered it deſtructive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of uſeful to the public, muſt be deemed moſt highly culpable, and the moſt unworthy members of human ſociety; as the deſtroyers of uſeful arts
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0652202100:68"/>are deſervedly reckoned more criminal and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, than the inventors or improvers of them have been accounted beneficent and honorable. And ſince it is apparent, that PHARMACY is an Art which the three firſt ranks of men among the antients, to wit, KINGS, PRIESTS, and PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHETS, did not diſdain to cultivate and occupy, as both ſacred and prophane hiſtories evidently teſtify; an <hi>art</hi> which is the <hi>mother</hi> and <hi>nurſe</hi> of many <hi>others;</hi> and which in it's <hi>purity</hi> contributed to the preſervation, not only of the living, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the dead Bodies of the illuſtrious; in fine an <hi>art</hi> which, under GOD, is one of the principal agents in preſerving the nobleſt machine of the Almighty's creation from diſorder, in reſtoring it when diſordered, and when by time it's ſprings and movements are worn out, and it's actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ceaſe, keeps it from corruption and decay for many ages: And ſince it is now manifeſt, that this <hi>excellent art</hi> has been effaced, perverted, and almoſt quite obliterated, by the pernicious <hi>abuſes, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>frauds</hi> of <hi>apothecaries and druggiſts,</hi> ſurely the ſubject of it's <hi>reſtoration</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi> well deſerves the ſerious attention of PARLIAMENT; as by the wiſe interpoſition of that alone, we may hope to ſee PHARMACY reſcued from the hands of barbarous <hi>aſſaſſins,</hi> revived, and once more ſhine in it's priſtine luſtre and beauty, reſtored to it's original uſe, worth and dignity. This is all that now ſeems wanting to bring the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic</hi> to it's <hi>primitive certainty,</hi> which by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>impoſitions,</hi> has been long rendered <hi>precarious</hi> and <hi>uncertain.</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. Order now leads me to the fourth and laſt thing propoſed, namely, to offer ſome means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch horrid mal-practices for the future, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in the foregoing, endeavoured with the greateſt care and impartiality to ſtate the <hi>caſe</hi> of <hi>pharmacy,</hi> to the beſt of my power. As the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper</hi> is moſt inveterate, perplexed, and complicate,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0652202100:69"/>ſo to preſcribe adequate remedies for it, requires a <hi>conſultation.</hi> But from the unjuſt oppoſition and ill uſage I met with from the fraternity, in my <hi>late attempt</hi> to reclaim the profeſſion, I can neither ask nor expect their aſſiſtance or concurrence in this <hi>Eſſay.</hi> Therefore, as neceſſity requires it, I muſt <hi>alone</hi> venture to offer my beſt thoughts upon the whole, tho' it is an hard taſk, and preſcribing, in either <hi>phyſic</hi> or <hi>law,</hi> not my proper province.— Before my preſcriptions are put in practice, let my worthy ſeniors juſtly correct and reprove me; I ſhall receive their amendments with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhall chearfully aſſent with every good man, that ſhall rationally treat this <hi>luxuriant evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the ſource of a diſtemper is known, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of cure is leaſt difficult;</hi> and <hi>when the cauſe of a diſorder is removed, the effect of courſe muſt ceaſe.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> I think I have diſcovered, the <hi>latter</hi> there are various ways of bringing about. <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as far as it may be conſiſtent with reaſon, and the ſafety of the <hi>ſick,</hi> gratify their taſte and adapt medicines to their <hi>gouts</hi> and weakly appetites. We know of old, that the <hi>diſtempered apothecaries</hi> and <hi>druggiſts,</hi> have the moſt <hi>vitiated palates</hi> and very <hi>weak, ſqueamiſh ſtomachs,</hi> and that they never yet could <hi>reliſh</hi> or <hi>digeſt any remedy</hi> given to alter or amend their <hi>morbid habit of body.</hi> Tho' many mild, rational attempts were made to reſtore them to their <hi>natural health,</hi> they would never conſent to uſe the means directed. At length, wearied with trying all the juſt methods, that muſt with ſenſible men have prevailed, the college of phyſicians final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, began to treat them, as real <hi>Maniacs</hi> required, with <hi>Helleborine</hi> and other <hi>draſtic</hi> remedies, which indeed had no better effect; for like true <hi>Bethlemites,</hi> they ſpurned the medicines, and when by force they were poured down their throats, they ſpewed them in their <hi>Archiators'</hi> faces. This will need no expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation when you recollect the violent oppoſition both publicly and privately made to the bill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0652202100:70"/>in the Houſe of Commons in the year 1725, <hi>to prevent abuſes in the practices of phyſic and pharmacy.</hi> In like manner in the year 1735, when the act now in force took it's riſe in the Houſe of Lords, tho' the whole fraternity privately and publicly confeſſed <hi>a reformation greatly wanting,</hi> and tho' ſome of the moſt eminent among them <hi>approved of the means then propoſed,</hi> yet did they jointly, unanimouſly oppoſe it, and publiſhed a <hi>caſe</hi> which they laid before the houſe; in which they aſſerted many weak falſhoods, and made ſundry, trivial and ridiculous evaſions, to prevent farther inquiries being made into their <hi>habitual frauds,</hi> or any laws paſſing to reſtrain them from their <hi>long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, evil practices.</hi> Theſe inſtances I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to ſhew, how averſe theſe men are and ever have been to <hi>reformation.</hi> I am ſorry to ſay it looks, <hi>as if they had loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi> For ſince no man can fear that <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> can ſuffer by an <hi>open examination</hi> or any <hi>fair teſt,</hi> ſure this averſion thereto is another plain proof of the neceſſity for ſome effectual law; which I humbly conceive may be made very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently by adding a few, proper clauſes to the <hi>preſent act:</hi> And I ſubmit it to your judgement, whether or no, it may be expedient to make the following amendments in that bill, and whether they may or not, anſwer the good purpoſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>

            <p>To this indictment I ſhall, according to form, plead, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and ſo put myſelf, for trial, on my <hi>cuſtomers</hi> and the <hi>public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the grand inſinuation in my prejudice, which has heretofore been made and will now probably be revived, is, <hi>that regardleſs of all public good, in unreaſonable averſion and appoſition to my fraternity, and by way of advertiſing and extolling my ſelf, by depretia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, I have turned a reformer, being in every inſtance acted more by ſelfiſh mercenary views, than any other.</hi>—This, I hope, to every conſiderate unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced reader, will appear as malicious, and as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as the reſt of their baſe detraction is falſe and uncharitable. I challenge any man to ſay, I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once known to leſſen the juſt merits of any apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary or druggiſt whatſoever. Had I none other motive than common policy, I ſhould not attempt to recommend my ſelf to the world by ſuch low, mean artifice: moreover, let it but be conſidered, did I heretofore, or do I now offer ought to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any honeſt, juſt apothecary, chemiſt or druggiſt? If I have, I declare it the effects of mere inadvertency; for it is not to be reaſonably imagined, that I ſhould knowingly do any thing to the prejudice of a profeſſion, which I have made my choice, by which I have hitherto lived, and ſtill purpoſe to follow, as long as the ſame excellent ſet of cuſtomers, which have hitherto dealt with me,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0652202100:78"/>and moſt nobly and generouſly encouraged me, are pleaſed to continue their unmerited favors. In the next place, I ſubmit it to the judgement of every candid breaſt, what <hi>mercenary views</hi> I could have had in this undertaking. I believe it is evident, tho' I was at great expence, and much trouble in writing and printing, and in attending the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the year 1735, that, inſtead of gaining any ſelfiſh advantages thereby, or in any ſort ſolliciting for ſuch, I have been a conſiderable ſufferer, if it were by none other means, than bringing upon me (tho' I hope undeſervedly) the implacable hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of all the apothecaries and druggiſts. And I hope there are ſome men of quality and diſtinction, ſtill living, who can atteſt, that tho' I was incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ſue for a parliamentary reward, yet I juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſdained all applications for the like, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the public good, which was likely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue from my weak endeavours. <hi>Vertue to a prepared heart, never fails of bringing an ample, concomitant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I will however confefs; that I have ſome <hi>ſelfiſh private</hi> (tho' not altogether mercenary) <hi>views,</hi> in ſolliciting a reformation of pharmacy, and a ſtrict examination of apothecaries and their ſhops, becauſe I would from my <hi>ſelf,</hi> as well as <hi>others,</hi> remove all temptations to the abuſe or corruption of my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and by all ways and means, promote the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and give all reaſonable encouragement to following it ſtrictly, juſtly, and faithfully. And I conceive the examination of apothecaries and drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, and the inſpection of their ſhops, would be one motive; as it muſt prove as advantageous to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſkilful honeſt apothecary and druggiſt, as it muſt be diſadvantageous to the unskilful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt. Moreover, as the apothecaries and drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, have been very active, and I have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to judge, there are ſome of them ſtill unwearied in wounding my character and reputation, in the moſt falſe, malicious, and uncharitable manner; I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0652202100:79"/>hope it is not culpable in me to ſeek, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of a general grievance, a public method of confuting thoſe groundleſs calumnies. For in ſuch a trial, I flatter my ſelf, it will appear, that if I ſhould not have had as fair an opportunity of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>pharmacy,</hi> or as good a capacity, as many of thoſe, who make a better figure in the profeſſion; I have taken more pains in acquiring ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in it, in order to make amends for ſuch <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages,</hi> and to ſupply ſuch a natural <hi>defect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might have taken the uſual liberty of dedicators, and here claim a ſanctuary to my ſelf, and this poor performance, by prefixing your illuſtrious name. But even this is an artifice I deſpiſe; for if it has not merit enough to maintain it's ground, tho' cloathed in this mean ſimplicity, let it be rejected, or fall unregarded.</p>
            <p>From one of your great humanity, refined taſte, and juſt notions of morality, I fear I may dread ſome cenſure for an unbecoming zeal, in uſing thro' this diſcourſe ſome <hi>terms of reproach, expreſſions, which may beſpeak an unſeemly freedom with my frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>as may ſavour ſomewhat of ſpleen or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective.</hi> In this reſpect, perhaps, I am to blame, but when you conſider how difficult it is to treat ſuch vile offenders as I complain of more properly, or for a man of any conſcience, or underſtanding, barely to mention ſuch baſe degeneracy, ſuch abominable perfidious villainy, as I have laid before you, or even but to think of the like, without ſome heat, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and abhorrence, I hope it will, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, plead my excuſe. I have induſtriouſly avoided perſonal reflections; except where the offenders were ſo ſingularly notorious, that they muſt be known to many, by mentioning their crimes only. And altho' I have from many of the ſociety, received much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ungenerous, and I may ſay, uncharitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian treatment; and altho' the dignity of the parliament-houſe in full ſeſſion, could not protect me from their violent rage, and mercileſs inſults,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0652202100:80"/>not only in the offices adjoining, but even at the bar of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of PEERS; yet, I moſt ſolemnly aver it to you, that it is not the perſons, but their vices I deteſt, and would expoſe. I know there are ſtill among them, men of diſtinguiſhed worth and candor, who are ready and willing to ſuffer a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and I am inclined to think, that many of thoſe, who formerly oppoſed it, were led thereto by inadvertency, or the clamors of the multitude. If any thing I have ſaid ſhould offend, or ſeem le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at particular perſons, I muſt ſay with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Garth,</hi>
