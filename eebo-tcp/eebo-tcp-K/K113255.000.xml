            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BIOGRAPHERS, in the purſuit of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, are naturally betrayed into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute reſearches. The curioſity of the reader is ſeldom proportioned to that of the writer in this ſpecies of compoſition. Every inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, relating to a favourite character which the mind has long contemplated with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acquires importance. On theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples we may venture to found a plauſible excuſe, for the many trifling diſcoveries, and intricate diſcuſſions of inſignificant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, with which perſonal hiſtory ſo much abounds.</p>
            <p>To this apology, which every biographer has a right to plead, the writer of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing memoirs preſumes he poſſeſſes a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0379500700:3"/>
claim, ariſing from his ſituation and connections. He deſcribes the life of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom the ſtrongeſt principles of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, implanted in early years, have habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taught him to regard with united vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and affection. Under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the ſlighteſt events appear intereſting; and the moſt frivolous anecdotes of ſuch a life are inveſtigated with a pleaſing enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, a want of materials might have juſtly been here alledged, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of an objection ſo conſtantly urged againſt works of this kind. It will readily be granted, that to record the lives of men who have adorned their country by monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of munificence, is a tribute indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably due to public merit, and which cannot without public injuſtice be witheld. But to diſcharge this duty even imperfectly, and by thoſe means, however inadequate, which the utmoſt exertions of diligent enquiry can afford, is leſs unpardonable than to neglect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0379500700:4"/>
it entirely. When we cannot recover a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect portrait of our friend and our benefactor, we muſt be contented with a few faint out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. Abundance only implies rejection; and where but little can be collected, it is neceſſary to retain every thing. We muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in anecdotes of inconſiderable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, while thoſe of more importance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be procured.</p>
            <p>Theſe inconveniencies might have eaſily been prevented. But our anceſtors had no regard for futurity. They truſted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of their heroes to chance and tradition; or rather, to the laborious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of a diſtant poſterity. For it is the taſk of modern times to commemorate, if they cannot imitate, the conſpicuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of antiquity; and to compoſe the panegyric of thoſe virtues which exiſt no more. Inquiſitive leiſure is not the lot of earlier eras. Ages of action are ſucceeded by ages of enquiry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0379500700:5"/>
But that ſpecies of enquiry which properly belongs to the biographer, ſeems, in point of time, to be poſteriour to that which forms the province of the hiſtorian. It does not grow faſhionable till late: it begins to be the favourite amuſement of cultivated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at their moſt poliſhed periods. When the more important and extenſive ſtores of hiſtorical information have been exhauſted, the growing ſpirit of curioſity, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in proportion as it is gratified, ſtill demands new gratifications; it deſcends to particularities, and delights to develope cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a ſubordinate nature. After many general hiſtories have been written, inquiſitive minds are eager to explore the parts of what they have hitherto ſurveyed at large. The ardour of reſearch, which gathers ſtrength from contraction, is exerted on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct periods; and at length perſonal hiſtory commences. Characters before only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the groſs, and but incidentally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0379500700:6"/>
or ſuperficially diſplayed, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſubject of critical diſquiſition, and a ſeparate examination. Occurences neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or omitted by the hiſtorian, form mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for the biographer: and men of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour eminence are ſelected from the common maſs of public tranſactions in which they were indiſtinctly grouped, and delineated as detatched figures in a ſingle point of view.</p>
            <p>Nor was it till late after the reſtoration of literature, that biography aſſumed its proper form, and appeared in its genuine character. The Lives which were compiled at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance after that period, are extremely jejune and defective performances. The firſt which approached to perfection were thoſe of Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſkius, by Peter Gaſſendus, and of Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, by Camerarius. It was long, before the perſeverance of inveſtigation connected with preciſion, the patient toil of tracing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, authenticating facts, and digeſting ſcattered notices, grew into a ſcience: in a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0379500700:7"/>
word, before the accuracy of the antiquarian was engrafted on the reſearches of the bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher. The maſterly Life of William of Wykeham will beſt explain and illuſtrate theſe reflections: a work which I chuſe to produce as an example on this occaſion, not only becauſe it is here produced as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample with a peculiar degree of propriety, but becauſe it is a pattern of that excellence in this mode of writing, which I mean to characteriſe and recommend.</p>
            <p>As ſir Thomas Pope bore ſome ſhare in the national tranſactions of his time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the dryneſs of perſonal and local inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I have endeavoured to render theſe pages in ſome meaſure intereſting to general readers, by dilating this part of my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and by ſometimes introducing hiſtorical digreſſions, yet reſulting immediately from the tenour of my ſubject. Amongſt theſe, I flatter myſelf that my relation of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the princeſs Elizabeth may merit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0379500700:8"/>
ſome attention: of which I have thrown together a more uniform and circumſtantial detail than has yet appeared, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſeveral anecdotes reſpecting that tranſaction not hitherto publiſhed.</p>
            <p>On the whole I may venture to affirm, that I have at leaſt attempted to make my work as entertaining as poſſible. My materials have not always been of the moſt brilliant kind; but they are ſuch, as have often enabled me to enliven and embelliſh my narrative by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting pictures of antient manners, which are ever ſtriking to the imagination.</p>
            <p>I have before hinted, that my reſources for compiling this hiſtory were ſlender and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient. From books I could obtain ſcarce any information. Indeed, my chief aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance has been derived from manuſcript au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. I have not however in this reſpect found the ſucceſs I wiſhed. Yet I have carefully conſulted every record that ſeemed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0379500700:9"/>
likely to illuſtrate my ſubject; and my refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences will ſhew, that I have ſearched a variety of authentic inſtruments, preſerved in the Britiſh Muſeum, the chapel of the Rolls, and other repoſitories of valuable originals. Of theſe the more important are printed at large in the Appendix.</p>
            <p>Among my references to manuſcript au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, two ſometimes occur which require explanation. Theſe are, <hi>MSS. Cotton. Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> F. 5. <hi>MSS. Strype.</hi> And, <hi>MSS. F. Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1709, that induſtrious and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate annaliſt Mr. John Strype, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to doctor Arthur Charlett, maſter of Univerſity college, originally fellow of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity college, an account of the Funeral of ſir Thomas Pope<note n="a" place="bottom">See Ballard's Coll. of Letters, MSS. Bibl. Bodl. fol. xv. pag. 31. Letter from Strype to Charlett, dated Lowlayton, Eſſex, Apr. 20. 1709. See LIFE, infr. p. 178.</note>. This account Strype had tranſcribed from a manuſcript of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0379500700:10"/>
Cotton library, which he perpetually cites in in his ECCLESIASTICAL MEMOIRS, marked <hi>Vitellius,</hi> F. 5<note n="b" place="bottom">In a letter from Strype to Charlett, dat. ibid. Apr. 5. 1709.

Yet it occurs to me, that ſir THOMAS POPE's Funeral, with the time and place, as alſo the reſt of pages 30, 31, [viz.] the funerals in thoſe pages mentioned, were taken from the volume, VITELLIUS F. 5. in the Cotton library, which is a certain brief journal of funeral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

There the writer ſets down all the particular ceremonies, the ſolemnities, and mourners, at that knight's interment. Which if you have any deſire to know, I will tranſcribe out of my notes and ſend you."</q> This is an original. Then follows the letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referred to, which is not the original, but a tranſcript by the late Mr. Rawlins of Pophills in Glouceſterſhire, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poſſeſſed of Charlett's extenſive correſpondence. See AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEND. p. 458. infr.</note>. Soon afterwards it appears that Strype ſent to Charlett, perhaps at his requeſt, a few other notices relating to ſir Thomas Pope, extracted from the ſame manuſcript.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0379500700:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The late learned Mr Francis Wiſe, keeper of the archives, Radclivian librarian, and fellow of Trinity college, at Oxford, copied all the tranſcripts, about four or five in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which Strype on this occaſion had made from the Cotton manuſcript, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Charlett, among whoſe curious and numerous papers they were kept; and by Mr. Wiſe they were thus communicated to me. Fortunately for the preſent underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the extracts had been made by Strype before the fire happened in the Cotton li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, then placed in Aſhburnham houſe at Weſtminſter, by which fatal accident this valuable volume was particularly damaged; and, as far as I can judge from a curſory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, moſt of the leaves, if not all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Strype's extracts, were either deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or obliterated<note n="c" place="bottom">But ſee APPEND. Numb. xxviii.</note>. The reader is therefore deſired to obſerve, that the reference, viz. <hi>MSS. Cotton. Vitell.</hi> F. 5. <hi>MSS. Strype,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies

Strype,</hi> the reader will remember, that ſuch citations were faithfully tranſcribed by myſelf from that manuſcript volume, now belonging to the Britiſh Muſeum.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wiſe alſo tranſcribed, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me, two or three other papers from doctor Charlett's collections, beſide thoſe of Strype which I have juſt mentioned<note n="e" place="bottom">See pp. 185. 189. And APPEND. Numb. xxix.</note>. Theſe I have called <hi>MSS. F. Wiſe</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">
                  <p>Since my firſt edition, among the manuſcript papers of the Rev. Thomas Wilkes, D.D. fellow of Trinity college, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and who died rector of Rotherfield Greys in Oxfordſhire, in 1745, I have met with other notices by Mr. Wiſe, which are now firſt inſerted in this edition, and are alſo ſtyled, MSS. F. Wiſe. Theſe Mr. Wiſe ſeems to have had chiefly from Dr. Charlett's collections, and the family-papers of the late ſir Harry Pope-Blount.</p>
                  <p>As to Charlett's collections, I learn that he derived many of his notices and informations on this ſubject, from Mr. Joſiah Howe, a fellow of the college; a ſhort account of whom will not be ſuperfluous, as it may tend to eſtabliſh their credit. He was born at Crendon in Bucks, and elected Scholar of Trinity college, June 12, 1632. Regiſtr. Coll. fol. 68. b. Admitted Fellow, being then bachelor of Arts, May 26, 1637. Ibid. fol. 72. b. By Hearne he is called, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a very great cavalier and loyaliſs, and a moſt ingenious man."</q> Rob. Glouc. GLOSS. p. 669. He appears to have been a general and an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcholar, and in polite literature eſteemed one of the ornaments of the univerſity. In 1644, he preached before king Charles the firſt at Chriſt-church cathedral Oxford. The ſermon was printed, and in red letters, by the king's ſpecial command. Only thirty copies were printed. One was purchaſed, in 1723, by Hearne from Dr. Charlett's library: the ſame, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only one extant, which is now among Rawlinſon's Books in the Bodleian. See Hearne's MSS. COLL. vol. 102. p. 8. Charlett bought this rarity many years before, at the high price of five ſhillings. Ibid. vol. 51. p. 176. In 1646, he was created Bachelor of Divinity by decree of the king, among others who were complimented with that degree for having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed themſelves as preachers before the Court at Oxford. He was ſoon afterwards ejected from his Fellowſhip by the preſbyterians, but not in the general expulſion in 1648, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Walker, SUFF. CLERG. p. 134. Being one of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars of the college and foreſeeing its fate, having reſolved at the ſame time never to acknowledge the authority of Cromwell's viſitors, he retired, in the beginning of the year 1648, to a college-eſtate in Buckinghamſhire, carrying with him many ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, rolls, papers, and other authentic documents, belonging to his office. He was invited to return to the college by Dr. Harris the new preſbyterian Preſident, on a promiſe, that if he would quietly give up the official books, his ſubmiſſion to the viſitors ſhould be diſpenſed with, and he ſhould be permitted to retain his fellowſhip without moleſtation. Harris by this artifice having recovered the books, immediately ſigned an order for Howe's expulſion; pretending to have received an unexpected injunction from the viſitors, and profeſſing his regret at being obliged to remove ſo valuable a member from the foundation. Hearne, MSS. COLL. vol. 89. p. 195. He was reſtored to his fellowſhip in 1660. He has a Copy of recommendatory Engliſh verſes prefixed to the folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher, printed in 1647. Another to Thomas Randoph's POEMS, reprinted at Oxford, in 1640. Another to Cartwright's COMEDIES and POEMS, at Oxford, 1651. Theſe pieces in the witty epigrammatic ſtyle which then prevailed, have uncommon acuteneſs, and highly deſerve to be revived. Some others have perhaps eſcaped me. In thoſe I have mentioned, he appears in company with Denham, Waller, Jonſon, Corbett, Brome, Shirley, Mayne, and others the moſt ingenious men of thoſe times, who were of his intimate acquaintance.

What was the firſt ſtep to his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in life, and whether it aroſe from the friendſhip of ſome private patron, from any diſtinguiſhed merit in his profeſſion, a peculiar caſt for buſineſs in general, or a lucky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of all theſe cauſes, cannot be preciſely determined, although from what follows it may be partly conjectured. He was not much more than twenty-ſeven years of age, when he had ſufficient addreſs or intereſt to procure an appointment to offices, which ſeem to have been alternately beſtowed upon Henry's moſt eminent favourites, and the moſt popular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of thoſe times<note n="y" place="bottom">Fuller in his quaint manner, obſerves concerning him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I behold him as fortunae ſuae fabrum; the ſmith, who by God's bleſſing, hammered out his own fortune without any patrimonial advantage."</q> Worthies of England, Article London, p. 223. edit. 1662.</note>.</p>
            <p>Having been early initiated, as I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in the buſineſs of chancery, on the fifth day October, 1533, he was conſtituted by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patent of Henry the eighth, clerk of the briefs in the ſtar-chamber at Weſtminſter<note n="z" place="bottom">See Append.

            <p>On the thirteenth day of November 1535, he was conſtituted, by the king's letters patent, warden of the mint, exchange, and coinage, in the tower of London, on the voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, in his favour, of John Coppynger, page of the great wardrobe<note n="b" place="bottom">Pat. 26.

On February the twenty-eighth, 1538, he obtained, at his own inſtance, a new royal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for exerciſing the office of clerk of the crown in conjunction with John Lucas<note n="e" place="bottom">Pat. 29. Hen. viii. ut ſupr.</note>, who was afterwards, in the reign of Edward the ſixth, an eminent crown-lawyer, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that prince in many important commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions<note n="f" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl.

The firſt of theſe grants he perhaps obtained by the recommendation of Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More; who preſiding as Lord Chancellor in the court above-mentioned, where Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pope was employed when a young man, might have taken particular notice of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing diligence and abilities; and from which circumſtance, a laſting friendſhip and intimacy between them both, as will be ſhewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſeems to have originally commenced. Although there is equal reaſon to ſuppoſe, as it will likewiſe appear in its proper place, that he was in no leſs favour and eſteem with Sir Thomas More's ſucceſſor, the Lord Chancellor Thomas lord Audley; under whoſe immediate inſpection and authority he exerciſed the office of clerk of the crown, and clerk of the briefs in the ſtar-chamber: and to both of which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0379500700:26"/>
departments, as I preſume, he muſt have been appointed by Lord Chancellor Audley's nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<note n="g" place="bottom">Lord Audley was appointed Lord Keeper, May 20, 1532, on the reſignation of Sir T.

Both offices, I apprehend, were in the appointment of the Chancellor, as the clerk of the crown is at preſent: although they paſſed in the king's name. The ſtar-chamber was a branch of chancery.

            <p>But theſe appointments were ſoon ſucceeded by one of much greater conſequence.

            <p>The principal deſign of this court was for eſtimating the lands of the diſſolved mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, veſted in the Crown, and for receiving their revenues. It had moreover full power and authority to ſell the monaſtic poſſeſſions for the king's ſervice<note n="i" place="bottom">From the act.</note>. It was ſo called from the encreaſe which the royal revenue received,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0379500700:27"/>
by this new acquiſition of property. All per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons holding leaſes and penſions, by former grants, from any convent, exhibited their titles before this court, and their pretenſions were allowed in proportion to their validity. And although the governors of the religious houſes, foreſeein their fate, often contrived immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the diſſolution of their reſpective ſocieties, to forge new contracts or indentures in favour of their friends or kindred, few frauds of this kind took effect. For the court ſeems to have been very vigilant in preventing and expoſing ſuch ſpecious impoſtures<note n="k" place="bottom">Fuller Ch, Hiſt. B. vi. p. 349.</note>.</p>
            <p>The officers of this court were a Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, it's ſuperior, a Treaſurer abovementioned, who was the ſecond officer, a ſollicitor, ten auditors, ſeventeen recievers, with others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the inferior departments.

            <p>The Treaſurer's office appears to have been a poſt of conſiderable profit and diſtinction, and of equal truſt and importance. He was ranked with the principal officers of ſtate in the reign of Henry the eighth. For by ſtatute of the ſame, he was privileged, together with

It would have broken the thread of my narrative, if I had before obſerved, that in 1535, June the twenty-ſixth, beginning now to riſe in the world, he received from Barker, otherwiſe garter king at arms, a patent for a new coat of arms, to be borne by him and his poſterity<note n="w" place="bottom">Penes honoratiſ.

            <p>A few years after the erection of the court of augmentations above-mentioned, the king perceiving that his exigencies required more expeditious returns of money than the annual revenues of the diſſolved monaſteries could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, was neceſſitated to ſell by one extenſive commiſſion a very conſiderable part of their lands, for the purpoſe of raiſing preſent ſupplies. By this ſtep the court of augmentations was ſoon diminiſhed. The cauſes depending in it became few and inconſiderable, and the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profits ariſing from thence decreaſed; it's offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were numerous, and their penſions ample. On theſe conſiderations he was induced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it; which he did by letters patent only: and on the ſecond of January, 1546, created by the ſame letters patent, a new court of augmentations, on a different and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined plan.</p>

It is commonly ſuppoſed, and it has been ſaid in general terms, that Sir Thomas Pope was appointed one of the commiſſioners, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, under Cromwell, for diſſolving the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſes. It is indeed true, that he was one of thoſe, into whoſe hands the ſeal of the magnificent and opulent abbey of Saint Alban's was ſurrendered on the fifth day of December, 1539, by the laſt abbot, Richard Stevenache<note n="h" place="bottom">Stevens's Monaſticon, i. 264. Weever's Fun. mon. p. 112. edit. 1631.</note>. This however is the only inſtance I can find, that he was ever concerned in this ſort of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. His name does not appear among the perſons ſpecially appointed by Cromwell for this purpoſe; whoſe names are recited by Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale<note n="i" place="bottom">Warwickſhire, p. 800, ſeq.</note> from an authentic manuſcript in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0379500700:36"/>
Cotton Library. Nor does his name occur in the private commiſſions, which, after a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch, I have ſeen relating to this matter; nor in any inſtruments of reſignation, letters of advice to the viſitor general, memorials, or other authentic papers, concerning the viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſuppreſſion of any monaſtery. My opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is therefore, that he was only occaſionally employed at Saint Alban's, as being one of the principal officers in the court of augmentations, as the place was in the neighbourhood of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and as the ſurrender of ſo famous an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey was an affair of ſome importance. Thus we find that the priory, now the dean and chapter, of Canterbury, was not diſſolved in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way; it being thought neceſſary, that the archbiſhop of Canterbury, the maſter of the rolls, Walter Henley attorney and Nicholas Bacon ſollicitor of the augmentation-court with four others, ſhould be ſent thither, to take the reſignation of the prior and monks<note n="k" place="bottom">Somner's CANTERBURY, by Batteley, Append. p. 118. It was 31. Hen. viii.</note>. However, if it can be proved, that he was ever engaged on other occaſions in theſe violent proceedings of an avaricious and arbitrary prince, it may at the ſame time be fairly preſumed, that in an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment which afforded ſo many obvious temptations to fraud, oppreſſion and rapacity,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0379500700:37"/>
he behaved with ſingular decency, moderation, and honour. Of this we have the impartial evidence of a prejudiced hiſtorian. For Fuller, who is remarkably ſevere on the viſitors in general, and who is ſeldom ſparing of his invectives, wherever he can diſcover the ſlighteſt foundation for abuſe, mentioning Sir Thomas Pope as an agent in theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, immediately ſubjoins: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"However, by all the printed books of that age, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth one of a candid carriage; and in this reſpect ſtands ſole and ſingle by himſelf. That of the abbey-lands which he received, he refunded a conſiderable proportion for the building and endowing Trinity college in Oxford<note n="l" place="bottom">Worthies. London, p. 223.</note>."</q> And in another place, he mentions him with honour on the ſame ſubject. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But the moſt pleaſant object to entertain us at this time in England, is the beholding of two fair and freſh foundations in Oxford; the one Trinity college, built by Sir Thomas Pope, <hi>principal viſitor</hi> at the diſſolution of abbies<note n="m" place="bottom">This is a miſtake, as we have before ſeen.</note>. Now as none were loſers employed in that ſervice, ſo we find few refunding back to charitable uſes; and perchance this man alone the thankful Samaritane who made a publick acknowledgement<note n="n" place="bottom">Church-Hiſt.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0379500700:38"/>
of Saint Alban's Abbey, he preſerved by his intereſt, and particular application to the king, the noble conventual church now ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and made parochial<note n="o" place="bottom">From the information of the late Sir Harry Pope-Blount, of Tittenhanger in Hertfordſhire.</note>: one of the earlieſt and moſt venerable monuments of Norman architecture remaining in England<note n="p" place="bottom">It was built by Paulin, the fourteenth abbot, a Norman, about the Year 1080.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the circumſtance of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received grants of the lands of the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſeems to have occaſioned the miſtaken ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he was frequently and profeſſedly concerned as a Commiſſioner in the diſſolution of their foundations. That his prodigious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was accumulated in conſequence of the deſtruction of the religious houſes, is not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the lucky oportunity of raiſing an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate from this grand harveſt of riches which now lay open before him, ſeems to have divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his thoughts from making a fortune by the law; a profeſſion which he moſt probably would have otherwiſe continued to cultivate with the greateſt ſucceſs, and in which he might have undoubtedly claimed the moſt opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and diſtinguiſhed ſtations. I could give a minute detail, from the moſt authentic evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, of the grants of abbey-land, which he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0379500700:39"/>
recieved during the reign of Henry the eighth; but it may ſuffice to obſerve in more general terms, that before the year 1556, he appears to have been actually poſſeſſed of more than thirty manors in Oxfordſhire, Glouceſterſhire, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire, Derbyſhire, Bedfordſhire, Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Kent; beſide other conſiderable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and ſeveral advowſons. Some of theſe poſſeſſions were given him by Henry the eighth; but the greateſt part was acquired by purchaſe while he was connected with the court of augmentations<note n="q" place="bottom">See Dugdale's Warwickſhire. And from the patents.</note>. Many of his eſtates were bought of Queen Mary<note n="r" place="bottom">Ex muniment. coll. praedict. And lib. prim. <hi>lez rates,</hi> ann. 3, 4. Phil. Mar. MSS.

Two years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, viz. May 1, 1556, in the ſtatutes of the college, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites thirty-five manors. Cap. vi.

            <p>But let us ſuppoſe, what indeed cannot be proved, that Sir Thomas Pope was one of Cromwell's viſitors in the affair of the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. For although I have inſinuated above, that theſe viſitors were not on all occaſions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely juſtifiable in their proceedings, I am yet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0379500700:40"/>
inclined to think, that their conduct and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour were in general leſs blameable than has been commonly repreſented.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder, that the monks ſhould load thoſe whom they eſteemed the inſtruments of their ruin with many calumnies; all which were ſtudiouſly propagated and heightened by their advocates of the catholic perſuaſion. And it ſhould at the ſame time be remembered, that the king's injunctions, under which they acted, were extremely ſevere; inſomuch, that many fraternities deſired their houſes might be rather entirely ſuppreſſed, than reformed under ſuch rigorous conditions.</p>
            <p>With regard to the vices and diſorders<note n="s" place="bottom">Even in the Nunneries, where, among the ſofter ſex, ſome degree of delicacy, at leaſt of decorum, might have juſtly been expected, the loweſt vices, not to inſiſt on the more criminal irregularities, were too often practiſed. In the Benedictine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Rumſey, in Hamſhire, at a viſitation by Biſhop Fox, held in the year 1506, Joyce Rows the abbeſs is accuſed of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Drinking, eſpecially <q rend="inline margQuotes">"tempore nocturno;"</q> and of inviting the nuns to her chamber every evening, for the purpoſe of theſe exceſſes, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"poſt completorium."</q> The nuns are alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to have ſuch frequent and familiar acceſs, at undue times, to the houſe of the bailiff or chief hind of the monaſtery, whence unfavourable ſuſpicions have ariſen; and the ſaid bailiff himſelf is ordered, no more to frequent the chambers of the abbeſs or nuns.

            <p>Nor ſhould it be forgotten, that the viſitors gave a favorable report of ſome houſes. They interceded earneſtly for the nunnery of God-ſtowe in Oxfordſhire: declaring that the nuns were ſtrict in their lives; and alledging that the ſuppreſſion of this houſe would prove an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable inconvenience, as moſt of the young ladies of the beſt families of that county were ſent thither for education<note n="t" place="bottom">Burnet.

He received indeed ſome grants of land from the crown about the firſt year of this king, with Cranmer archbiſhop of Canterbury, the duke of Somerſet, the earl of Warwick, the marquis of Northampton, and ſeveral other principal perſons of the court.

The unlimited authority, and arbitrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Henry, had kept both proteſtants and papiſts in ſubjection. Under ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they both acted uniformly, and neither party preſumed to claim any apparent ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But upon the deceaſe of that uncontroulable monarch, the people diſcovered their real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents without reſerve, and proteſtantiſm manifeſtly began to be the prevailing religion. The protector Somerſet, who had long been a ſecret partiſan of the reformers, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of young Edward, publicly declared his intention of forwarding and eſtabliſhing the reformation. In this ſcheme he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſeconded by moſt of the privy council, who after the fall of Southampton ſeem en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to have deſerted the catholic commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The protector wiſely took care that all perſons to whom he entruſted the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the young king, ſhould be attached to theſe rational principles; and preferred and encouraged thoſe alone that appeared active in this profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Thus moſt of the courtiers, yet more perhaps in general from lucrative views than from real conviction, became converts to the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party: amongſt which, however, I do not find ſir Thomas Pope. This, at leaſt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0379500700:54"/>
ſhews a ſteadineſs and uniformity of mind in thoſe days of change, which afford ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances of occaſional compliance.</p>
            <p>Nor let it be deemed any inconſiſtency of character, that he, though a rigid papiſt, ſhould have been in the preceding reign an agent for ſuppreſſing the monaſteries, and a receiver of their poſſeſſions. For the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of theſe houſes was not an act of the church but of the ſtate. It was prior to the reformation of religion, and effected by a king and parliament of the popiſh communion. It was even confirmed by the parliament of queen Mary<note n="n" place="bottom">Statut, 1, 2. Phil. Mar. cap. viii. inf. citat.</note>.</p>
            <p>Very few papiſts wrote or remonſtrated againſt the deſtruction of theſe ſocieties. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt impeachment of their principles, or ſuſpicion of apoſtacy, ſeveral others, the ſtricteſt members of the catholic perſuaſion, and the moſt reſpectable characters of thoſe times, among which, to mention no more, was the duke of Norfolk, accepted grants of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual eſtates.</p>
            <p>Even the clergy thought it no ſacrilege to ſhare in theſe acquiſitions. The dean and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0379500700:55"/>
chapter of Litchfield, and the abbot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Weſtminſter, made no ſcruple of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving manors alienated from other religious corporations<note n="o" place="bottom">See Tanner's Notit. Mon. fol. edit. pref. p. xxxix.</note>, lately diſſolved. Burnet tells us<note n="p" place="bottom">Ref. i. 251.</note>, that biſhop Gardiner was remarkably ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in declaiming againſt the monaſteries; and that in many of his ſermons he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the king for ſupperſſing them<note n="q" place="bottom">See Fox, vol. ii. p. 426.</note>. Queen Mary, in the very firſt year of her reign, made grants of the ſite of twenty religious houſes, and of very large quantities of abbey-land<note n="r" place="bottom">Tanner, ubi ſupr.</note>. The biſhops and clergy in a catholic convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1554, petitioned that the pope would not inſiſt on a reſtitution of the eccleſiaſtical revenues, but rather confirm them to thoſe lords and gentlemen by whom they had been obtained<note n="s" place="bottom">Wilkins's Councils. iv. 10t.</note>. And it is notorious, that ſome of the popiſh biſhops were no leſs alienators of their epiſcopal endowments<note n="t" place="bottom">Tanner ubi ſupr. And Collier Eccl. hiſt. xi. 324, 306. Heylin p. 121.</note>, than many other biſhops of the proteſtant church proved afterwards, in the reigns of Edward the ſixth and Elizabeth. The biſhop of Chicheſter, in opening the diſputation of Henry the eighth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0379500700:56"/>
with Lambert, in Weſtminſter-hall, ranked the king's diſincorporation of the monks with his rejection of the ſee of Rome, his abolition of idolatrous adoration, and the introduction of the Engliſh bible; as a matter of an external nature, and in no reſpect interfering with the eſſentials of the catholic communion<note n="u" place="bottom">See MSS. C. C. C. C. cxxvii. 5.</note>. The monaſtic inſtitution was no part of the papiſtic theology. Undoubtedly the ſuppreſſion of the convents facilitated the admiſſion of proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: but it was evidently undertaken on other principles.</p>
            <p>When queen Mary ſucceeded to the throne, ſir Thomas Pope was again taken into favour, and ſoon afterwards conſtituted one of the queen's privy counſellors<note n="w" place="bottom">Hollingſhead. iii. 1159.

            <p>But before I proceed further in this reign, it may be proper to obviate ſome ſeeming diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and inconſiſtences, by premiſing, on what ſecurity ſir Thomas Pope, together with many others, held his church-revenues, under
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0379500700:57"/>
a bigotted catholic queen, and upon the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the popiſh religion. By way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing new conceſſions in favour of Rome, and to prevent unſeaſonable alarms, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this reign, both the queen and the pope had given repeated aſſurances that the church and abbey lands ſhould remain, forever unreclaimed, in the hands of their preſent poſſeſſors<note n="y" place="bottom">Heylin Eccle. reſt. p. 41.</note>. But that the tenure of theſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions ſhould not be fixed on ſo precarious a foundation as that of mere promiſes, in 1554, an act of parliament was paſſed; which, while it reſtored the pope's authority, gave abſolute ſecurity to the proprictors of the eccleſiaſtical eſtates, entirely confirmed their title beyond the power of reſumption, and, at the ſame time, exempted them from the danger of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual cenſures<note n="z" place="bottom">Statut. 1, 2. Phil. Mar. cap. viii.</note>. In the mean time, that this meaſure might receive the fulleſt ſanction, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Pole, who was inveſted by the pope with legantine juriſdiction, ratified the parliament's decree: and, that the diſpenſation might be ſtill more ample and effectual, in conſequence of his maſter's commiſſion, the legate enſured even the property of future acquiſitions of church lands to the preſent receivers<note n="a" place="bottom">Ibid.

Thus, an equivalent was granted on both ſides. The nobility and gentry were ſettled in the quiet enjoyment of their eſtates; and the pope, although moſt eſſentially weakened by the alienation of that wealth on which his power ſo much depended, was reinſtated in his ſupremacy over the church.</p>
            <p>During this reign ſir Thomas Pope was often employed in commiſſions of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. On the twenty-ninth day of July, 1553, he was commiſſioned by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, together with ſir Arthur Darcy, and others<note n="b" place="bottom">Burghley's State papers, by Haynes, p. 162.</note>, to apprehend lord Ruſſel, Anthony Browne of Eſſex, and ſeveral accomplices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the duke of Northumberland's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; who, on the death of Edward, had raiſed an army with an intent to place the lady Jane Gray on the throne, before Mary was proclaimed queen. The duke himſelf had been apprehended ſome little time before. For after many fruitleſs efforts, and vain expectations of a reinforcement, he ſuddenly changed his principles, diſmiſſed his troops, and tamely ſubmitted to proclaim queen Mary with all external demonſtrations of triumph and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Being immediately arreſted by the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0379500700:59"/>
earl of Arundel, he fell on his knees and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectly begged his life<note n="c" place="bottom">Burnet, Ref. ii. 239.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the ſame year, on the twenty-third day of February, I find him directed by the council, together with lord Rich, the maſter of the rolls, the lieutenant of the Tower, and others, to appoint a certain number of the council, who ſhould conſtantly remain, and diſpatch buſineſs, at London<note n="d" place="bottom">Q Mary's council book, MSS.

Mem. iii. 33.</note>. By which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0379500700:60"/>
it appears, that this department had been greatly neglected in the foregoing reign; or that the queen was willing to take the proper precautions againſt any future attack on her title, from her factious and diſcontented ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The ſame year, on the twenty-ninth day of October, he was appointed, with the lord treaſurer, the earl of Arundel, lord Rich, ſir Francis Englefield, and ſeveral others, to examine certain offenders taken in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland's rebellion, and to aſſeſs their fines<note n="h" place="bottom">Burghley's State papers, ut ſupr. p. 193.</note>.

This expedient of borrowing money at an exorbitant intereſt of the merchants of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp, was a meaſure which Mary was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put in practice more than once<note n="n" place="bottom">Council-book. MSS. Brit. Muſ. ut ſupr.</note>. And it had been to her honor, if ſhe had uſed no worſe. For indeed the chief object of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which for ſome time engaged her attention, was to raiſe large ſums by the moſt irregular methods, or to extort money from her ſubjects. She ſometimes endeavoured to recruit her exhauſted exchequer by retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public expences at home. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed ſeveral forts on the river below Graveſend, which were filled with ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous garriſons; ſhe broke all the body guards, half the band of penſioners, the gentlemen of the ſtables, and the pages of honor: and propoſed to diſband the hundred archers of the guard. But to frugality ſhe added oppreſſion, and her unhappy neceſſities fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently compelled her to the moſt violent and unjuſtifiable experiments. She levied ſixty thouſand marks from ſeven thouſand yeomen, and thirty-ſix thouſand pounds from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. This was exacted, becauſe they had not contributed to a former loan of ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds levied on a thouſand perſons, in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0379500700:64"/>
whoſe compliance, either on account of their loyalty or their riches, ſhe firmly confided. But that tax not being found ſufficient, ſhe exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds each, on all who poſſeſſed an annual income of twenty pounds. This impoſition obliged many of the gentry to reduce their domeſtic expences, and to diſmiſs many of their ſervants, that they might, at leaſt more prudently, comply with her commands. And as theſe ſervants, having no means of ſubſiſtence, by too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a tranſition from that ſtate of idleneſs, betook themſelves to theft and robbery, the queen knew no better method of redreſſing the grievance, than to publiſh a proclamation, obliging their former maſters to take them back to their ſervices. In order to gratify the city of London for paſt favors, and to engage them to aſſiſt her with future ſupplies, ſhe iſſued an edict, at their inſtance, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for four months, the exportation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh clothes into Flanders. By this iniquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous combination, a good market was procured in that country for ſuch as had already ſent thither large quantities of that ſort of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe<note n="o" place="bottom">Carte, iii. 330, 331, 337, 341.</note>.</p>
            <p>Her extravagancies proved a perpetual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the commercial intereſts of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0379500700:65"/>
kingdom. Her own bigottry was not always a ſufficient reſtraint on her conſcience, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her from expoſing to ſale the revenues<note n="p" place="bottom">See ſupr. pag. 40.</note> of that church, in defence of which ſhe had ſacrificed in the flames ſo many victims. But it would be endleſs and impertinent here, to mention at large her multiplied extortions; and the various imprudent or fraudulent ſchemes, which her exigencies invented for obtaining money. It may be ſufficient to add, that theſe expedients were employed, not to carry on an expenſive war, for ſhe was in profound peace with all the world; nor to promote the national welfare by any new eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments or improvements: but to ſatisfy the unjuſt demands of a huſband, who ſlighted her love, neglected her intereſts, and ſolely conſulted his own convenience.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion one cannot help obſerving the weakneſs of the human mind under the moſt powerful and importunate of paſſions. Mary regarded her huſband Philip with all the fondneſs and ſollicitude of an uncertain lover. This attachment produced ſtrange contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in her ſentiments and behaviour. She was naturally too phlegmatic to be profuſe; yet, from a penurious and economical habit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0379500700:66"/>
of mind, ſhe ſuddenly became rapacious and expenſive. She perſecuted the reformed with the moſt barbarous ſeverities, yet alienated the riches aſſigned to ſupport her favorite ſuperſtitions. In this ſituation, ſhe was at once deſerted by that cold and ſtoical inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which diſtinguiſhes her character; and the ſedate and gloomy queen ſuffered herſelf to be betrayed into greater inconſiſtencies of conduct, than even the moſt unaccountable caprice of her father Henry could have dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</p>
            <p>Before the reign of queen Mary, it was the common practice with our Engliſh princes to have recourſe to the city of Antwerp for voluntary loans; and we generally find their credit ſo low, that they were obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the city of London to join in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But this buſineſs ſeems never to have been ſo effectually conducted as by that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic-ſpirited and enterprizing merchant, ſir Thomas Greſham, who began to be employed in this agency by Edward the ſixth<note n="q" place="bottom">See Burghley's State papers, by Haynes, p. 185. And Ward's Life of Greſham, p. 7.</note>. He was likewiſe employed by queen Elizabeth for the ſame purpoſe; one of whoſe firſt ſteps, at her acceſſion, was to procure money. She
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0379500700:67"/>
ſent Greſham to Antwerp to borrow two hundred thouſand pounds, in order to enable her to reform the coinage, at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely debaſed. But, as a moſt ſenſible and acute hiſtorian obſerves<note n="r" place="bottom">Hume, hiſt. Eliz. p. 731. edit. 410.</note>, ſhe was ſo impolitic as to make herſelf an innovation in the coin; by dividing a pound of ſilver into ſixty-two ſhillings, inſtead of ſixty, the former ſtandard.</p>
            <p>In the year 1557, on the eighth of February, ſir Thomas Pope was joined by the queen, in a famous commiſſion for the more effectual ſuppreſſion of heretics<note n="s" place="bottom">Burner's Reformation, Coll. of records, part. ii. b. ii. p. 311. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Having ſpecial truſt and confidence in your fidelities, wiſdoms, and diſcretions, &amp;c."</q>
               </note>, in concert with Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, biſhop of London, Thirlby, biſhop of Ely, the Lords Windſor and North, ſecretary Bourne, ſir John Mordaunt, ſir Francis Engle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, ſir Edward Waldegrave, ſir Nicholas Hare, ſir Roger Cholmeley, ſir Richard Read, ſir Thomas Stradling, ſir Rowland Hill, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Raſtall, Cole, dean of ſaint Paul's, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cooke, Thomas Martin, John Story, and John Vaughan, doctors of law, and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Roper and Ralph Cholmeley, eſquires. Theſe commiſſioners were empowered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after all perſons ſuſpected of heretical
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0379500700:68"/>
opinions: to ſearch for and ſeize ſeditious and heterodox books, either expoſed to ſale, or ſecreted in private houſes: to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and examine concealments, contempts, conſpiracies, and calumnies, againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They were ordered to detect thoſe perſons who refuſed to preach the ſacrament of the altar, to hear maſs, to take holy bread or holy water, to frequent their reſpective public churches, and to aſſiſt in the ſolemn proceſſions. They were likewiſe privileged to ſummon what witneſſes they judged moſt proper, and to tender oaths to the parties proſecuted, for anſwering ſuch queſtions as might be deemed moſt convenient for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the truth, In this injunction how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there is a remarkable clauſe of reſtraint upon the commiſſioners. For it is expreſſly commanded, that if any perſon brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them for heretical doctrines or opinions, ſhould ſtill obſtinately perſiſt in his error, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He ſhould immediately be committed to his ordinary, there to be uſed according to the ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical laws."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Biſhop Burnet, whoſe imagination was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually haunted with the horrors of popery, ſuppoſes, that ſomething more dreadful was intended by this commiſſion than appears at firſt ſight, and that it was undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0379500700:69"/>
as the tribunal of an Inquiſition in England<note n="t" place="bottom">Hiſt. Ref. ii. 347.</note>. But a ſuperficial reader may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, that there is nothing of the form, proceſs, or power, of an Inquiſition contained in this inſtrument. The commiſſioners receive no authority to try heterodoxy, nor to put the offenders upon <hi>making an act of faith.</hi> On the contrary, they are directed to deliver up all delinquents to the ordinary. And even here the proceſs is to be regulated by the laws of the church. Theſe circumſtances ſeem ſufficiently to exclude the idea of an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial tribunal. For the proceedings of the commiſſioners, however rigorouſly they might have been conducted, were not unlimited and arbitrary; but finally determinable by the proper eccleſiaſtical officer, who was himſelf controlled by the ſpiritual conſtitutions of the land, which did not at leaſt on this occaſion, receive any degree of extenſion. The zealous biſhop makes the matter ſtill more alarming, where he tells us, that in ſupport of ſuch meaſures, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"he finds it ſaid, that ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed that courts of inquiſition, like thoſe in France and Spain, might be ſet up in England<note n="u" place="bottom">Ubi ſupr. p. 346.</note>."</q> But he does not inform us by whom this is ſaid, nor can I find this advice

in any of our hiſtorians. Even Fox, who omits nothing that can expoſe the papiſts, who has ſtudiouſly recorded all the idle reports of the times, and who ſuppoſed that the papiſts worſhipped one god and the proteſtants another<note n="w" place="bottom">He thus rallies the devotion of the people, for praying for Mary's happy delivery of a child, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Cry up louder you prieſts, peradventure YOUR GOD IS ASLEEP.</q> Vol. iii. p. 116.</note>, is ſilent on this important ſubject. And indeed if we conſider the queen's late expoſtulation with the pope, in which ſhe declared her reſolution of maintaining the prerogative and the conſtitution<note n="x" place="bottom">When the Pope would have obtruded a new legate, in the place of cardinal Pole, and while he was actually on his journey to England, the queen abſolutely refuſed his admiſſion into the kingdom.

            <p>But whatever was the real ſtate of the caſe, we find that the commiſſioners, ſenſible that perſecution naturally counteracts its own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0379500700:71"/>
and averſe to meaſures which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably end in the moſt inhuman puniſhments, did little or nothing in this buſineſs<note n="z" place="bottom">Heylin, ubi ſupr.</note>: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the detection of prohibited books. For ſo inactive were they, that on the ſixth of June, 1558, the queen was obliged to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a proclamation<note n="a" place="bottom">Heylin, ubi ſupr. Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 459.</note>; in which ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that not only numberleſs ſeditious and treaſonable treatiſes, were printed at home and diſperſed without controul, but even import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from abroad. As the provocation was great, ſo the proclamation is conceived in the moſt deſpotic and unconſtitutional terms. It ſets forth, amonſt other extraordinary menaces, that if thoſe perſons who find ſuch unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful books do not immediately deſtroy them, they ſhall be reputed rebels, and executed accordingly by martial law. The queen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had ſome reaſon for complaint, and for ſubſtituting ſomewhat more effectual in the place of her former commiſſion by this recent injunction. For during the actual ſubſiſtence and authority of that commiſſion, Knox and Goodman printed, and imported from Geneva, a piece entitled, <hi>The firſt Blaſt of the Trumpet againſt the monſtrous Regimen of Women</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Genev. 8vo. 1558.</note>. In

this performance, which is full of paradox and enthuſiaſm, they call the queen <hi>Trait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, Baſtard, Proſerpine;</hi> with other terms of illiberal and ridiculous abuſe. Goodman alſo publiſhed about the ſame time, <hi>How ſuperior Powers ought to be obeyed of their Subjects, and wherein they may be lawfully by God's Word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed and reſiſted</hi>
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Genev. 16to. 1558. printed by John Criſpin. Unluckily, Mary herſelf while princeſs, in 1548, yet certainly without any heretical intention, had publiſhed a piece, which of courſe fell under the cenſure of this commiſſion. It was a tranſlation of Eraſmus's paraphraſe on St. John, and done by deſire of queen Catharine Parr. The preface is written by Udall, maſter of Eton-ſchool; in which he much extolls, and I believe not without reaſon, Mary's proficience in literature.</note>. But theſe treatiſes, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten chiefly for the gratification of Calvin then living at Geneva, were not more invectives againſt the invincible bigottries of Mary, and the groſs abſurdities of popery, than they were openly ſubverſive of all eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and religion.

            <p>Amongſt other paſquinades, there were prints, or pictures, repreſenting her majeſty, naked, meager, withered, and wrinkled, with every aggravated circumſtance of deformity that could diſgrace a female figure, ſeated in a regal chair; a crown on her head, ſurrounded with M.

Underneath, in Italian characters, were legends, ſignifying that the Spaniards had ſucked her to ſkin and bone; as alſo ſpecifying minutely the money, rings, jewels, and other preſents, with which ſhe had ſecretly gratified her huſband Philip. The queen was highly incenſed at this inſolent and popular piece of ridicule; eſpecially as ſhe ſuſpected ſome of her own council, who alone were privy to theſe tranſactions, and acquainted with her ſecrets<note n="g" place="bottom">Carte, iii. 331.</note>.</p>

With regard to the perſecutions of this reign, which occaſioned the commiſſion in which Sir Thomas Pope was concerned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the ſuppreſſion of heretics, we will allow that the queen and her friends had ſuffered, what they thought the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious treatment; and, no doubt, when power returned into their hands, were but too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diſpoſed to retaliate in their own way. Theſe oppreſſions, perhaps injudiciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, prepared the way for popery: juſt as the ſeverities of Mary, at the ſucceſſion of Eliſabeth made the proteſtants more violent againſt the papiſts. In the reign of Henry the eighth, the monaſteries were deſtroyed, and the wealth of the church, in which it's ſtrength conſiſted, was diſſipated. Three of the abbots, in the courſe of that tranſaction, were unjuſtly put to death<note n="h" place="bottom">Collier, Eccl. Hiſt. ii. 164.</note>. Six biſhops, amongſt which were Mary's favorites, and the great champions of her religion, Bonner and Gardiner, were deprived, inſulted, and impriſoned, during the reign of Edward the ſixth<note n="i" place="bottom">See Heylin, Eccleſ. Reſt. ſub. ann. 1551.</note>. In the ſame reign, the queen, while princeſs, was abſolutely forbidden to hear maſs; a misfortune, in her ideas, almoſt equal

            <p>But as no religion can expiate, ſo no provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can juſtify, no reſentment can excuſe, that uninterrupted ſeries of deliberate barbarity which marks every page of her unproſperous annals with martyrdoms, hardly to be parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the pagan perſecutions of primitive chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. If in the two preceding reigns, many venerable prelates of Mary's communion had been injuriouſly treated, or even put to death, for conſcientious diſobedience, yet none of them were inhumanly dragged to the flames like the meek Latimer or the learned Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. It is alſo allowed, that to burn heretics was an eſtabliſhed doctrine of the catholic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But in what age of the ſame religion, or in what country, were theſe puniſhments ever executed with ſo many circumſtances of cruelty? Her attempt to reſtore the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, however conformable to her ſyſtem, was a meaſure, which tended only to bring back national poverty with national ſuperſtition: for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0379500700:76"/>
it is certain, that Henry's diſtribution of the monaſtic revenues into private hands, although dictated by ſelfiſh and fordid motives, founded the preſent greatneſs of England. In the mean time it will be but charitable to grant, that her private life was confeſſedly blameleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed. I will not ſay whether it was her fault or her unhappineſs, that the conſtancy of her attachments ſeldom met with ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of gratitude and affection. In this at leaſt ſome goodneſs of heart appears, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affected her ſo much, as the unkindneſs of thoſe whom ſhe beſt loved. She poſſeſſed a firmneſs of mind, which deſerved better times; and a vigour of underſtanding, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded by religious prejudices. Her merits, whatever they were, ſeem to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked in her misfortunes: and as the latter were aggravated, ſo the former were obliterat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by that blaze of proſperity which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the ſucceeding reign.</p>

            <p>IN the year 1555, the princeſs Elizabeth, afterwards queen, having been before treated with much inſolence and inhumanity, was placed under the care and inſpection of ſir Thomas Pope<note n="a" place="bottom">Fox, edit. 1684. iii. 798. Speed, &amp;c.</note>. Mary cheriſhed that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to the certain heireſs of her crown and her ſucceſſor, which all princes who have no children to ſucceed naturally feel. But the moſt powerful cauſe of Mary's hatred of the princeſs, with whom ſhe formerly lived in ſome degree of friendſhip<note n="b" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 14. 17. 82. At queen Mary's coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the lady Elizabeth rode in the firſt chariot, with lady Anne of Cleves, after the queen's litter, in the proceſſion from the tower to Weſtminſter. Strype, ib. 36. See alſo Hollingſh. Chron. iii. 1152. col. 1.</note>, ſeems to have ariſen from Courtney, earl of Devonſhire.</p>

He lived a priſoner in the tower, from fourteen to twenty-ſix years of age; when he was ſet at liberty by queen Mary, at her acceſſion. Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 339.</note> of this young nobleman, had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0379500700:78"/>
made a manifeſt impreſſion on the queen<note n="d" place="bottom">Burnet, Ref. ii. 255.</note>. Other circumſtances alſo contributed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him an object of her affection; for he was an Engliſhman, and nearly allied to the crown; and conſequently could not fail of proving acceptable to the nation. The earl was no ſtranger to theſe favorable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the queen towards him<note n="e" place="bottom">Goodwyn, p. 339.</note>. Yet, he ſeemed rather to attach himſelf to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; whoſe youth and lively converſation had more prevailing charms than the pomp and power of her ſiſter<note n="f" place="bottom">Burnet, Ref. ii. 273. Collier, Eccl. Hiſt. ii. 352, 362.</note>. This preference not only produced a total change in Mary's ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which regard to the earl, but forced her openly to declare war againſt Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>The ancient quarrel between their mothers remained deeply rooted in the malignant heart of the queen<note n="g" place="bottom">Camden, Eliz. per Hearne, i. <hi>Apparatus,</hi> pag. 19.</note>: and ſhe took advantage from the declaration made by parliament in favor of Catharine's marriage<note n="h" place="bottom">Statut. Mar. i. cap. i.</note>, to repreſent her ſiſter's birth as illegitimate. Elizabeth's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the proteſtant religion ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heightened Mary's averſion: it offended her bigottry, diſappointed her exſpectations,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0379500700:79"/>
and diſconcerted her politics. Theſe cauſes of diſlike, however, might perhaps have been forgotten by degrees, or, at leaſt, would have ended in ſecret diſguſt. But when the queen found that the princeſs had obſtructed her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in a matter of the moſt intereſting nature; female reſentment, founded on female jealouſy, and exaſperated by pride, could no longer be ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>So much more forcible, and of ſo much more conſequence in public affairs, are private feelings, and the ſecret undiſcerned opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, than the moſt important political reaſons. Monſieur Noailles, however, the French embaſſador at the court of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land during this period, with the true dignity of a myſterious ſtateſman, ſeems unwilling to refer the queen's diſpleaſure to ſo ſlight a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and aſſigns a more profound intrigue as the foundation of Courtenay's diſgrace. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic incidents operate alike in every ſtation of life; and often form the greateſt events of hiſtory.

            <p>Elizabeth being now become the public and avowed object of Mary's averſion, was openly treated with much diſreſpect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. She was forbidden to take place, in the

Among other arguments enforcing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Mary's marriage, he particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the failure of the royal lineage; art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully remarking, that none of Henry's deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants remained, except the queen, and the <hi>princeſs</hi> Eliſabeth<note n="l" place="bottom">Avoiding the term <hi>ſiſter.</hi> Amb. de Noailles, apud Carte, iii. 310.</note>.

And while her amiable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications every day drew the attention of the young nobility, and rendered her univerſally popular, the malevolence of the vindictive queen ſtill encreaſed. The princeſs therefore thought it moſt prudent to leave the court: and before the begining of 1554, retired to her houſe at Aſhridge in Hertfordſhire<note n="m" place="bottom">

to the queen's match with Philip of Spain. It was immediately pretended, that the princeſs Eliſabeth, together with lord Courteney, was privately concerned in this dangerous conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and that ſhe had held a correſpondence with the traitor Wyat. Accordingly<note n="n" place="bottom">See Hollingſhed's Chron. iii. 1151. ſeq.

However they informed her, it was the queen's reſolution the ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower, till further enquiries could be made<note n="q" place="bottom">Hollingſhead, ut ſupr.</note>. The princeſs immediately wrote to the queen, earneſtly entreating that ſhe might not be impriſoned in the Tower, and concluding her letter thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As for that Traytor Wiat, he might paraventur write me a letter; but on my faith I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceved any from him.

She was conveyed to the tower, and ignominiouſly conducted through the Traitor's gate<note n="s" place="bottom">May 18. As MSS. Cott. Vitell. F. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>At her firſt commitment, only three men and three women of the queen's ſervants, were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0379500700:83"/>
appointed for her attendants. But even theſe were forbidden to bring her meat; and ſhe was waited on, for this purpoſe, by the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's ſervants, or even by the common ſoldiers. But afterwards, two yeomen of her chamber, one of her robes, two of her pantry and ewry, one of her buttery, one of her cellar, another of her larder, and two of her kitchen, were allowed, by permiſſion of the privy council, to ſerve at her table. No ſtranger, or viſitor, was admitted into her preſence. The conſtable of the tower, ſir John Gage, treated her very ſeverely, and watched her with the utmoſt vigilance. Many of the other priſoners, committed to the ſame place on account of the rebellion, were often exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined about her concern in the conſpiracy: and ſome of them were put to the rack, by way of extorting an accuſation. Her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence however was unqueſtionable: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Wyat himſelf had accuſed her, in hopes to have ſaved his own life by means of ſo baſe and ſcandalous an artifice, yet he afterwards denied that ſhe had the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his deſigns; and leſt thoſe denials which he made at his examinations might be inſidiouſly ſuppreſſed, and his former depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions alledged againſt her adopted in their ſtead, he continued to make the ſame declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

openly on the ſcaffold at the time of his execution<note n="t" place="bottom">Hollingſhead, ut ſupr.</note>,</p>
            <p>There was a pretence, much inſiſted on by Gardiner, that Wyat had conveyed to her a bracelet, in which the whole ſcheme of the plot was incloſed. But Wyat acquitted her of this and all other ſuſpicions<note n="u" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 97.</note>. After a cloſe impriſonment of ſome days, by the generous interceſſion of lord Chandois, lieutenant of the tower, it was granted that ſhe might ſometimes walk in the queen's lodgings<note n="10" place="bottom">Concerning theſe apartments in the Tower, ſee the very judicious and ingenious Mr. Walpole's <hi>Hiſtoric Doubts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Richard the Third.</hi>

            <p>Such were their jealouſies, that a little boy of four years old who had been accuſtomed every day to bring her flowers, was ſeverely threatened if he came any more; and the child's father was ſummoned and rebuked by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0379500700:85"/>
the conſtable. But lord Chandois being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to treat the princeſs with too much reſpect, he was not any longer entruſted with the charge of her; and ſhe was committed to the cuſtody of ſir Henry Bedingfield, of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh in Norfolk<note n="x" place="bottom">He was firmly attached to the queen's intereſts. Beſide his Government of the Tower, he was knight marſhal of the queen's army, captain of her guards, vice-chamberlain to the queen, and a privy counſellor.

began to be convinced, that orders had been given to put her privately to death. The next day ſhe reached Windſor, where ſhe was lodged in the Dean's houſe near ſaint George's collegiate chapel.

            <p>Arriving at Woodſtock, ſhe was lodged in the gatehouſe of the palace; in an apartment remaining complete within theſe fifty years with it's original arched roof of Iriſh oak, curiouſly carved, painted blue ſprinkled with gold, and to the laſt retaining it's name of <hi>Queen Elizabeth's chamber</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">The old royal manor, or palace, at Woodſtock, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in the grand rebellion, and much damaged in the ſiege. The furniture was afterwards ſold, and the buildings portion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by Cromwell, or his agents, to three perſons. Two of them, about 1652, pulled down their portions for the ſake of the ſtone. The third ſuffered his part to ſtand, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the gatehouſe in which the princeſs Elizabeth was impriſoned, and ſome adjoining ruinous buildings. After the rebellion, lord Lovelace turned this gatehouſe into a dwelling houſe, and lived in it for many years. As to its adjoining ruins, perſons now living remember ſtanding, a noble porch, and ſome walls of the hall; the walls and magnificent window; of the chapel; ſeveral turrets at proper diſta ces; and could trace out many of the apartments. Sir John Vanbrugh, while Blenheim palace was building, had taſte enough to lay out 2000 l. in keeping up the ruins. But afterwards lord treaſurer Godolphin obſerved to Sarah, dutcheſs-dowager of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, that a pile of ruins in the front of ſo ſine a ſeat, was an unſeemly object, all the old buildings, and amongſt the reſt, the princeſs Elizabeth's gatehouſe, were entirely demoliſhed and eraſed. Aubrey, the antiquarian, acquaints us that in the old hall there were two rows of pillars, as in a church; and that the arches were of the zigzag Norman ſhape. He has left us in his manuſcript, Drawings of the windows in the larger apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in the chapel and hall. Aubrey's CHRONOLOGIA ARCHITECTONICA, MSS. in Muſ. Aſhmol.

Of fair Roſamond's <hi>Bower,</hi> which literally ſignifies no more than a <hi>chamber,</hi> and which was a kind of pleaſure-houſe on the ſouth-weſt ſide of the old palace, ſome ruinous remains are ſtil remembered: particularly, an apartment over Roſamond's-well. This <hi>well,</hi> which is a large, clear, and beautiful ſpring, paved and fenced about the inſide with ſtone, was undoubtedly a bath, fountain, or reſervoir, for the convenience of the <hi>Bower,</hi> or perhaps of the palace.

Hollingſhead, p. 117. col. 2. But there is ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, that Fox, from whom Hollingſhead tranſcribes, has aggravated, in his account, ſir Henry's uſage of the princeſs. After ſhe was queen, he was very often at court, and her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty viſited him in a progreſs, 1578. And though ſhe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called him her <hi>Jaylor,</hi> yet this ſeems rather to have been a term of royal familiarity than of contempt.

See Blomeſield's Norfolk, iii. 481.</note>. But this ſudden kindneſs of Philip, who thought Eliſabeth a much leſs obnoxious character than his father Charles the fifth had conceived her

to have been, did not ariſe from any regular principle of real generoſity, but partly from an affectation of popularity<note n="g" place="bottom">He affected to treat the princeſs with much reſpect.

            <p>In her firſt day's journey, from the manor of Woodſtock to lord Williams's at Ricot, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtorm of wind happened; inſomuch, that her hood and the attire of her head were twice or thrice blown off. On this, ſhe begged to retire to a gentleman's houſe then at hand: but Bedingfield's abſurd and ſuperabundant circumſpection refuſed even this inſignificant requeſt; and conſtrained her, with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorum,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0379500700:92"/>
to replace her head-dreſs under a hedge near the road. The next night they came to Mr. Dormer's, at Winge, in Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamſhire; and from thence to an inn at Colnebroke, where ſhe lay. At length ſhe arrived at Hampton-court, where the court then reſided, but was ſtill kept in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a priſoner. Here biſhop Gardiner, with others of the council, frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her to make a confeſſion, and ſubmit to the queen's mercy. Diſſimulation appears to have been a conſpicuous feature in Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's character. One night, when it was late, the princeſs was unexpectedly ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conducted by torch light to the queen's bedchamber: where ſhe kneeled down before the queen, declaring herſelf to be a moſt faithful and true ſubject. She even went ſo far, as to requeſt the queen to ſend her ſome catholic treatiſes, which might confirm her faith, and inculcate doctrines different from thoſe which ſhe had been taught in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the reformers. The queen ſeemed ſtill to ſuſpect her ſincerity: but they parted on good terms.

Her governors likewiſe, on their parts, apprehending that this tenderneſs towards their miſtreſs might be interpreted in a bad ſenſe, diſpatched a letter to biſhop Gardiner, lord chancellor; acquainting him with her condition, and avowing their readineſs to receive the queen's commands.

Prefixed to Aſcham's very ſenſible Engliſh political tract on the AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAIRES OF GERMANIE, and addreſſed to Aſtley, is an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh letter, dated 1553, from Aſtley to Aſcham, in which the latter ſpeaks feelingly of their frequent agreeable converſations on learned ſubjects at Hatfield-houſe. Aſcham was preceptor to the princeſs. Sir Thomas Pope, in a fragment of a letter to the preſident of Trinity-college Oxford, and dated Hatfield, ſays, that he had procured an Office in the Tower of London for <hi>Maiſter Aſteley.</hi> Probably this is the ſame perſon. Aſcham in ſome of his Epiſtles complains, that he was unjuſtly driven from his tuition of Eliſabeth, in a conſequence of a party form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him in the family of the princeſs. My principal reaſon for mentioning theſe particulars is to ſhew, that ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pope could not have been one of Aſcham's enemies on this occaſion; for, had that been the caſe, it is not very probable that he ſhould promote Aſcham's friend. He was huſband of Catharine Aſteley, the governeſs of the princeſs. See below, p. 99. Aſcham mentions this Catharine Aſteley in very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable terms, in a Letter to the princeſs, on the death of her tutor Grindall. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hunc dolorem, magis apud te renovando augere, quam conſolando leni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re vererer, niſi perſpecta eſſet mihi prudentia tua, ſic conſiliis prudentiſſimae Feminae do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae Catharinae Aſtleae munita, &amp;c."</q> EPIST.

is evident that he was removed from this charge, when the princeſs, notwithſtanding her infirm ſtate of health, was hurried up to the court by Southwell, Cornwallis, and Haſtings: nor do we find, that from that time he had the leaſt concern with her during her impriſonment in the tower and at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, and the reſt of thoſe undeſerved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, which preceded her enlargement and final removal to Hatfield.</p>
            <p>To this lady ſir Thomas Pope behaved with the utmoſt tenderneſs and reſpect: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding with her at Hatfield, rather as an indulgent and affectionate guardian, than as an officious or rigorous governor.

            <p>Nor was ſir Thomas Pope wanting on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſions, in ſtudiouſly ſhewing her ſuch marks of regard and deference as her ſtation and quality demanded.

            <p>Two of the fellows of Trinity college in Oxford, juſt founded by him, had violated one of it's ſtricteſt ſtatutes, and were accordingly expelled by the preſident, and Society. Upon <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0379500700:99"/>
this they repaired to their founder, then at Hatfield with the princeſs Eliſabeth, humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly petitioning a readmittance into his college. Sir Thomas Pope probably was not a little perplexed on this occaſion; for although diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to forgiveneſs, yet he was unwilling to be the firſt who ſhould openly countenance or pardon an infringement of laws which himſelf had made. But perceiving a happy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of adjuſting the difficulty, by paying at the ſame time a handſome compliment to the princeſs, with much addreſs he referred the matter to her gracious arbitration; and ſhe was pleaſed to order, that they ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be reſtored to their fellowſhips.

In April the ſame year, ſhe was eſcorted from Hatfield to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-chaſe, by a retinue of twelve ladies clothed in white ſattin on <hi>ambling palfries,</hi> and twenty yeomen in green, all on horſe back, that <hi>her grace</hi> might <hi>hunt the hart.</hi> At entering the chaſe, or foreſt, ſhe was met by fifty archers in ſcarlet boots and yellow caps, armed with gilded bows; one of whom preſented her a ſilver-headed arrow, winged with peacock's feathers.

with the privilege of cutting the throat of a buck<note n="y" place="bottom">Vitell. F. 5. MSS. Cotton. MSS. Strype ut ſupr.</note>.

            <p>In the ſummer of the ſame year, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs paid a viſit to the queen at Richmond. She went by water from Somerſet-place in the queen's barge; which was richly hung with garlands of artificial flowers, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a of canopy green ſarcenet wrought with branches of eglantine in embroidery, and powdered with bloſſoms of gold. In the barge ſhe was accompanied by ſir Thomas Pope, and four ladies of her chamber. Six boats attended on this proceſſion, filled with her highneſs's retinue, habited in ruſſet da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſke and blue embroidered ſattin taſſelled and ſpangled with ſilver, with bonnets of cloth of ſilver plumed with green feathers. She was received by the queen in a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous pavilion, made in form of a caſtle, with cloth of gold and purple velvet, in the labyrinth of the gardens. The walls, or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0379500700:105"/>
ſides of the pavilion were chequered into compartments, in each of which was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately a lily in ſilver and a pomegranate in gold. Here they were entertained at a royal banquet; in which was introduced a <hi>ſottletie</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">A curious deviſe in cookery or confectionary.</note> of a pomegranate-tree bearing the arms of Spain. There were many minſtrels, but no maſking or dancing. Before the banquet, the queen was long in conſultation with ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pope. In the evening the princeſs with all her company returned, as they came, to Somerſet-place; and the next day retired to Hatfield<note n="b" place="bottom">MSS. Cotton. Vitell. F. 5. MSS. Strype, ut ſupr.</note>. During her reſidence at Hatfield, the princeſs was alſo preſent at a royal Chriſtmas, kept with great ſolemnity by the queen and king Philip at Hampton-court. On Chriſtmas-eve, the great hall of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace was illuminated with a thouſand lamps curiouſly diſpoſed. The princeſs ſupped at the ſame table in the hall with the king and queen, next the cloth of ſtate: and after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſerved with a perfumed napkin and plates of confects by the lord Paget. But ſhe retired to her ladies, before the revels; maſking, and diſguiſings began. On ſaint Stephen's day ſhe heard mattins in the queen's cloſet adjoining to the chapel, where ſhe was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0379500700:106"/>
attired in a robe of white ſattin, ſtrung all over with large pearls. On the twenty ninth day of December, ſhe ſate with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties and the nobility at a grand ſpectacle of juſting, when two hundred ſpears were broken. Half of the combatants were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred in the Almaine, and half in the Spaniſh faſhion<note n="c" place="bottom">Vitell. F. 5. Cotton. MSS. Strype, ut ſupr.</note>. Thus our chronicler, who is fond of minute deſcription. But theſe and other particularities, inſignificant as they ſeem, which he has recorded ſo carefully, are a vindication of Queen Mary's character in the treatment of her ſiſter: they prove, that the princeſs, during her reſidence at Hatfield, lived in ſplendor and affluence, that ſhe was often admitted to the diverſions of the court, and that her preſent ſituation was by no means a ſtate of oppreſſion and impriſonment, as it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by moſt of our hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>We have before ſeen that ſir Thomas Pope, during his attendance on this lady, was engaged in the foundation of his college. An undertaking of ſuch a nature, could not fail of attracting the attention of the young Eliſabeth; whoſe learned education and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation naturally intereſted her in the progreſs of a work ſo beneficial to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0379500700:107"/>
of her favorite purſuits, and carried on by one with whom ſhe was ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected. Accordingly this ſubject was often matter of converſation between them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from part of a letter written by ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pope: which alſo ſtill further proves the friendly terms on which they lived together. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The princeſs Eliſabeth her grace, whom I ſerve here, often aſkyth me about the courſe I have devyſed for my ſcollers: and that part of myne eſtatutes reſpectinge ſtudie I have ſhewn to her, which ſhe likes well.

Aſcham, in one of his Latin Epiſtles, gives the following intereſting account of Eliſabeth's progreſs in literature, when ſhe was very young, under the year 1550. Among the learned daughters of Sir Thomas More, he ſays, the princeſs Eliſabeth ſaines like a ſtar of diſtinguiſhed luſtre; deriving greater glory from her virtuous diſpoſition, and literary accompliſhments, than from the dignity of her exalted birth. I was her preceptor in Latin and Greek for two years. She was but little more than ſixteen, when ſhe could ſpeak French, and Italian, with as much fluency and propriety as her native Engliſh. She ſpeaks Latin readily, juſtly, and even critically. She has often converſed with me in Greek, and with tolerable facility. When ſhe tranſcribes Greek or Latin, nothing can be more beautiful than her hand-writing. She is excellently ſkilled in muſic, although not very fond of it. She has read with me all Cicero, and great part of Livy. It is chiefly from thoſe two authors alone, that ſhe has acquired her knowledge of the Latin langnage. She begins the day with reading a portion of the Greek teſtament, and then ſtudies ſome ſelect Orations of Iſocrates and the tragedies of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles. From theſe authors, I was of opinion, that ſhe would adorn her ſtyle with the moſt elegant diction, enrich her mind with the moſt ſuitable precepts, and frame her high ſtation of life to every fortune. For her religious inſtruction, after the Scriptures, ſhe adds to the claſſics Saint Cyprian and the Common Places of Melancthon, with other writers of that ſchool, who teach purity of doctrine with elegance of expreſſion. In every compoſition, ſhe is very quick in pointing out a far-fetched word, or affected phraſe. She cannot endure thoſe abſurd imitators of Eraſmus, who mince the whole latin Language into proverbial maxims. She is much pleaſed with a Latin Oration naturally ariſing from its ſubject, and written both chaſtly and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. She is moſt fond of tranſlations not too free, and with that agreeable claſh of ſentiment which reſults from a judicious compariſon of oppoſite or contradictory paſſages. By a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attention to theſe things, her taſte is become ſo refined, and her judgment ſo penetrating, that there is nothing in Greek, Latin, and Engliſh compoſition, either extravagant or exact, carleſs or correct, which ſhe does not in the courſe of reading accurately diſcern; immediately rejecting the one with diſguſt, and receiving the other with the higheſt degree of pleaſure.

            <p>In conſequence of ſir Thomas Pope's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, the queen herſelf wrote a letter to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0379500700:111"/>
the princeſs, in which ſhe expreſſed her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and diſbelief of theſe infamous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries. It was anſwered by the princeſs, who declared her deteſtation of the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and diſclaimed the leaſt knowledge of their malicious deſigns. Undoubtedly having ſuffered ſo ſeverely, and perhaps unjuſtly, in the affair of Wyat, ſhe judged it expedient to clear her character even from the moſt improbable ſuſpicions. Commiſſioners were immediately appointed for examining into this conſpiracy, ſir Francis Englefield the comptroller, ſir Edward Waldegrave, ſir Henry Jernegan, ſir Edward Haſtings, and Cordall the queen's ſollicitor; and ſeveral of the parties were apprehended, and condemned at Guildhall<note n="i" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 336, 337.</note>. When war was next year pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt France, this ſecret concurrence of the French court, with the machinations of Dudley Aſhton and his accomplices, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly ſpecified, amongſt other articles in the declaration<note n="k" place="bottom">Camden, Eliz. per Hearne. i. <hi>Apparat.</hi> pag. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>Soon afterwards, Eric king of Sweden ſent by his ambaſſador, a meſſage ſecretly to the princeſs at Hatfield, with a propoſal of marriage. King Philip had juſt before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0379500700:112"/>
to the queen to marry her to the duke of Savoy<note n="l" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl. Mem., iii. 317.</note>; with a view perhaps of retaining the duke who was an able general, in his intereſts againſt France, with which Philip was at this time engaged in open hoſtilities. This propoſal of the king of Sweden ſhe wiſely rejected, becauſe it was not conveyed to her by the queen's directions. But to this objection the embaſſador anſwered, that the king of Sweden his maſter, as a man of honor and a gentleman, thought it moſt proper to make the firſt application to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and that having by this preparatory ſtep obtained her conſent, he would next, as a king, mention the affair in form to her majeſty. But the final anſwer of princeſs was an abſolute denial: and ſhe deſired the meſſenger to acquaint his maſter, that as ſhe could not liſten to any propoſals of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unleſs made by the queen's advice or authority; ſo ſhe could not but declare, that if left to her own will, ſhe would always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſingle condition of life. The affair ſoon came to the queen's ears; who ſending for ſir Thomas Pope to court, received from him an entire account of this ſecret tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ordering ſir Thomas at the ſame time to write to the princeſs, and acquaint her
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0379500700:113"/>
how much ſhe was ſatisfied with this prudent and dutiful anſwer to the king of Sweden's propoſition. Sir Thomas Pope very ſoon afterwards returned to his charge at Hatfield; when the queen commanded him, not only to repeat this approbation of the conduct of the princeſs relating to the propoſed match from Sweden, but to receive from her own mouth the reſult of her ſentiments concerning it; and at the ſame time to take an opportunity of ſounding her affections concerning the duke of Savoy, without mentioning his name. The imperial ambaſſadors Mountmorency lord of Courieres, and Bouchard, were ſtill in England, waiting for the event of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter negociation<note n="m" place="bottom">Carte, iii. 307.</note>.

of this invitation, was formally to propoſe to her in perſon a marriage with Philibert Emanuel, the duke of Savoy, which ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pope, by the queen's commands, had before hinted at a diſtance, as we have ſeen in the preceding letter. This propoſal the princeſs declined; but diſguiſed her refuſal with the ſame earneſt profeſſions of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable devotion to a ſtate of virginity, which ſhe had before made to ſir Thomas Pope on account of the Swediſh match.

            <p>One ſhould have expected that the queen would have parted in diſguſt with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, at this rejection of a match, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Philip, and ſo convenient to his purpoſes. But it appears, that the queen was extremely backward in promoting her huſband's deſire of marrying Eliſabeth to the duke of Savoy. On this account, Philip employed Alphonſus, a franciſcan frier, his confeſſor, to confer with her majeſty on the ſubject of this marriage. She told him, that ſhe feared, without conſent of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither her huſband Philip, nor the nation would be benefited by this alliance. She added, that ſhe could not in point of conſcience preſs this match upon her ſiſter;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0379500700:121"/>
meaning perhaps that it would be unjuſt, to force the princeſs to be married, after her reſolute declarations againſt wedlock; or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and diſhonorable, to match her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the dignity of a crowned head. The theological reaſonings of Alphonſus were too refined for the underſtanding, or too weak for the conſcience, of the queen, who ſtill remained inflexible in her former opinion. Upon this, Philip wrote to her in his uſual authoritative ſtyle, adviſing her to examine her own conſcience, and to conſider whether her opinion was founded in truth or in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy; adding, that if the parliament op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his requeſt, he ſhould lay the blame upon her<note n="x" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. 317. ſeq.</note>. The queen, in her anſwer, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he would, at leaſt, defer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till he returned into England: and that then he might have a better opportunity of judging, what attention her reaſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. That otherwiſe, ſhe ſhould live in jealouſy of his affections, a ſtate of mind to her worſe than death; but which, to her great diſquietude, ſhe had already began to feel. She obſerved, with many expreſſions of deference to his ſuperior judgment and authority, that, whatever her conſcience might have determined, the matter could not be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0379500700:122"/>
poſſibly brought to any ſpeedy concluſion, as the duke would be immediately ordered into the field.</p>
            <p>This letter which is in French, and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Strype<note n="y" place="bottom">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. Append. Numb. LVI.</note>, is no leſs a ſpecimen of her implicit ſubmiſſion to Philip, than the whole tranſaction is, at the ſame time, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that unconquerable perſeverance which the queen exerted on certain occaſions. Philip perſiſted in his deſign: and with a view to accompliſh it more effectually, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched into England the ducheſs of Parma and the ducheſs of Lorraine, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to bring back with them the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Eliſabeth into Flanders. Philip was in love with the ducheſs of Lorain; and the ſplendor of her table and retinue, which ſhe was unable to ſupport of herſelf, made the queen extremely jealous. She was therefore, whatever her companion might have been, a very improper ſuitreſs on this occaſion. The queen would not permit the two ducheſſes to viſit the princeſs at Hatfield; and every moment of their ſtay gave her infinite uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But they both ſoon returned, without ſucceſs<note n="z" place="bottom">Carte, iii. 338.</note>.</p>

Perhaps the growing jealouſy of the queen, a paſſion which often ends in revenge againſt the beloved object, might at leaſt have ſome ſhare in dictating this oppoſition to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip<note n="a" place="bottom">Philip, while abroad, had ſhewn her ſo many marks of indifference, and had trifled with her ſo frequently about his return to England, that once, in a fit of rage, ſhe tore his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Carte, ibid. 329.</note>. At length the remonſtrances of the queen, and the repeated diſapprobation of the princeſs, prevailed; and it is certain, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mary's real motives might be, that the propoſal was ſuddenly laid aſide. But Mary ſo far concurred with Philip's meaſures, as the next year to declare war againſt France<note n="b" place="bottom">Yet the public finances were at this time ſo low, that ſhe could not procure a ſingle vote from her privy-council for the declaration of war: and ſhe therefore threatened to diſmiſs them all from the board, and to appoint counſellors more obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious.

            <p>As to the king of Sweden, he afterwards, in the year 1561, renewed his addreſſes to Eliſabeth, when ſhe was queen of England: at which time, he ſent her a royal preſent of

At the ſame time, ſome ſtationers of London had publiſhed prints of her majeſty Eliſabeth and the king of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in one piece. This liberty, as it was called, gave great offence to the queen, who ordered ſecretary Cecil to write to the lord mayor of London, enjoining him diligently to ſuppreſs all ſuch publications; as they implied an agreement of marriage between their majeſties.

            <p>The four laſt years of queen Mary's reign, which the princeſs Eliſabeth paſſed at Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field with ſir Thomas Pope, were by far the moſt agreeable part of her time during that turbulent period. For although ſhe muſt have been often diſquieted with many ſecret fears and apprehenſions, yet ſhe was here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at liberty, and treated with a regard due to her birth and expectations. In the mean time, to prevent ſuſpicions, ſhe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declined interfering in any ſort of buſineſs, and abandoned herſelf entirely to

books and amuſements<note n="i" place="bottom">Burnet, Hiſt. Ref. ubi ſupr. p. 363.</note>. The pleaſures of ſolitude and retirement were now become habitual to her mind; and ſhe principally employed herſelf in playing on the lute or virginals, embroidering with gold and ſilver, reading Greek, and tranſlating Italian. She was now continuing to profeſs that character which her brother Edward gave her, when he uſed to call her his <hi>ſweet ſiſter Temperance</hi>

            <p>Upon the acceſſion of the new queen, who was reſident at Hatfield when her ſiſter Mary died on November the ſeventeenth, 1558, it does not appear that ſir Thomas Pope was continued in the privy-council. This circumſtance may juſtly be interpreted to his honor. Eliſabeth, to prevent an alarm among the partiſans of the catholic communion, had prudently retained thirteen of Mary's privy counſellors. Theſe were, Heathe, archbiſhop of York, and lord chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; the marquis of Wincheſter, lord treaſurer; the earls of Arundel, Shrewſbury, Pembroke, and Derby; the lords Clinton, and Howard; ſir Thomas Cheyney, ſir William

His good ſenſe and good diſpoſition led him to reflect, that he could not beſtow a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of thoſe riches which he had ſo largely received, with greater propriety, uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and generoſity, than in the ſervice of the public. I ſhall therefore make no apology for delivering at large a hiſtory of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in forming and completing this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral deſign.</p>
            <p>And perhaps there are ſome of my readers, who will be more pleaſed to view him in the milder and more amiable light of the father of ingenuous education, diſpenſing rewards to ſcience and virtue, than in the more active yet turbulent ſcenes of public life, diverſified only
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0379500700:129"/>
by the vain viciſſitudes of human affairs, or fraught with the crimes and misfortunes of mankind.</p>
            <p>About the year 1290, Richard de Hoton, prior, and the monks, of the cathedral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Durham, erected a college in the northern ſuburbs of Oxford, for the education of the novices of their monaſtery; to which it was conſidered as an appendage<note n="a" place="bottom">See grant in the Appendix, Numb. VI. Which, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably contains the firſt and early ſeparation of the ground on which Trinity college now ſtands, with its precincts, or of the greateſt part of theſe, to the purpoſes of learning, was thought too curious to be omitted among the original papers.</note>. This was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards increaſed, with the addition of revenues and books, by Richard of Bury, biſhop of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, in the year 1345. It was at length entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuilt, more effectually eſtabliſhed, and more amply endowed, for eight benedictine monks and eight ſecular ſtudents, in the year 1370, by the munificence of Thomas Hatfield, biſhop of the ſame ſee<note n="b" place="bottom">The monks were allowed annually ten pounds each, and the ſeculars five mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. It is remarkable, that the ſtipend of theſe monks is treble to moſt of the fellowſhips then in Oxford.</note>. About the year 1541, this college was diſſolved by Henry the eighth<note n="c" place="bottom">See Stevens's Monaſt. vol. i. p. 343. from MSS. A. Wood.</note>: at which time, all its eſtates, its ſite, precinct, chapel, bellfry, buildings of all ſorts,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0379500700:130"/>
with the entire appurtenances of the ſame, were granted by the king to his new dean and chapter of Durham cathedral, which, as I preſume, they now poſſeſs<note n="d" place="bottom">See Append. Numb. *VII*.</note>. Its ſite only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the crown; for Edward the ſixth, in the ſeventh year of his reign, by letters patent dated February the fourth, 1552<note n="e" place="bottom">See Append. Numb. VIII.</note>, granted the ſite of this college to George Owen, of Godſtowe, the king's phyſician, and William Martyn, gentleman.</p>
            <p>On this ground ſir Thomas Pope determined to found his intended college. Accordingly, by indenture, dated February the twentieth, 1554<note n="f" place="bottom">See Append. Numb. IX.</note>, he purchaſed the premiſes of the ſaid Owen and Martyn. In the ſame year he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Philip and Mary a royal licence, or charter, dated March the eigthth, 1554<note n="g" place="bottom">See Append. Numb. X.</note>, empowering him to create and erect a certain college within the univerſity of Oxford, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one preſident a prieſt, twelve fellows, four of whom ſhould be prieſts, and eight ſcholars<note n="h" place="bottom">This Number he afterwards encreaſed to <hi>twelve.</hi>
               </note>: and liberally and ſufficiently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the ſame and their ſucceſſors with certain manors, lands, and revenues. In the ſame
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0379500700:131"/>
charter, and with the eſtates and poſſeſſions therein recited, he likewiſe obtains licence of the king and queen to found and endow a ſchool at Hokenorton in the county of Oxford, to be called <hi>Jeſus Scolehouſe;</hi> and to give ſtatutes as well to the college, as to the firſt and ſecond maſters of the ſaid ſchool<note n="i" place="bottom">

            <p>On ſaint Swithin's day, being the fifteenth of July, in the ſame year, the founder paid a viſit to his college. He was accompanied by the biſhops of Wincheſter and Ely, and other eminent perſonages. He diſmounted from his horſe at the college gate, where he was received by the preſident, who ſtood at his ſtirrup. At entering the gates he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in a long and dutiful oration by the vice-preſident: after which the burſars of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him a preſent of embroidered gloves. From thence he was conducted with the reſt of the company into the preſident's great chamber: the fellows and ſcholars ſtanding on either ſide, as he paſſed along the court. Having viewed the library and Grove, they proceeded to dinner in the hall, where a ſumptuous entertainment was provided. The preſident ſate on the left hand of the founder,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0379500700:138"/>
yet at ſome diſtance, and the reſt of the gueſts, and the ſociety, were placed according to their rank, and in their proper order. There were twelve minſtrels preſent in the hall; and among other articles of proviſion on this occaſion, four fat does, and ſix gallons of <hi>Muſcadel,</hi> are mentioned. The whole expence of the feaſt amounting to xij<hi>l.</hi> xiij<hi>s.</hi> ix<hi>d.</hi> After dinner they went to evening maſs in the chapel, where the preſident celebrated the ſervice, habited in the richeſt cope: and the founder offered at the altar a purſe full of angels. They then retired to the Burſary; where the founder paid into the hands of the Burſars all the coſts incurred by this viſit: and gave them beſides, at the ſame time, a ſilver goblet gilt, which being filled with hypocraſſe, he drank to the Burſars, and to all the company preſent. He then departed towards Windſor: but before he left the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, gave with his own hands, to each of the ſcholars, one marc<note n="c" place="bottom">See Append. Numb.

 are many marks of his attention to the affairs and economy of his college, and of his ſollicitude about ſettling every article of the new foundation in the moſt effectual manner: as alſo of his readineſs to aſſiſt on all neceſſary occaſions. In the letter juſt mentioned, among ſeveral other particulars, he tells the preſident, in conſequence of a converſation which had lately paſſed between them both at Tyttenhanger in Hertfordſhire, by what expedient certain extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the college, in the late viſitation<note n="e" place="bottom">Concerning which I find the following entries, in Comp.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0379500700:151"/>
could not have been conferred at a more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time on the univerſity. And of this ſir Thomas Pope was very ſenſible, as we have before ſeen, when he ſubſtituted an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional number of academical ſtudents in the place of a grammar-ſchool.</p>
            <p>But that it may further appear, how much theſe encouragements were now wanted, it will be neceſſry to look backwards upon the ſtate of learning in England, particularly at Oxford; and from thence to trace its progreſs, and the cauſes of its decline, down to the times with which we are concerned. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry not leſs inſtructive than entertaining, and naturally connected with the preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>About the cloſe of the fifteenth century, a taſte for polite letters, under the patronage of the popes, began to be revived in Italy. But theſe liberal pontiffs did not conſider at the ſame time that they were undermining the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal intereſt, and bringing on the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This event is commonly called the Reſtoration of Learning; but it ſhould rather be ſtyled the reſtoration of good ſenſe and uſeful knowledge. Learning there had been before, but barbariſm ſtill remained. The
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0379500700:152"/>
moſt acute efforts of human wit and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been exerted for ſome centuries, in the diſſertations of logicians and theologiſts; yet Europe ſtill remained in a ſtate of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and ignorance. What philoſophy could not perform, was reſerved to be complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by claſſical literature, by the poets and orators of Greece and Rome, who alone could enlarge the mind, and poliſh the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Taſte and propriety, and a rectitude of thinking and judging, derived from theſe ſources, gave a new turn to the general ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of ſtudy: mankind was civilized, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was reformed. The effects of this happy revolution by degrees reached England.</p>
            <p>We find at Oxford, in the latter end of the fifteenth century, that the univerſity was filled with the jargon and diſputes of the Scotiſts and Thomiſts; and if at that time there were any ſcholars of better note, theſe were chiefly the followers of Wicliffe, and were conſequently diſcountenanced and perſecuted. The latin ſtyle then only known in the univerſity, was the technical language of the ſchoolmen, of caſuiſts, and metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. At Cambridge, about 1485, nothing was taught but Alexander's <hi>Parva Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicalia,</hi> the trite axioms of Ariſtotle, which were never rationally explained, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

queſtions of John Scotus<note n="b" place="bottom">Eraſm. Epiſt. H. Bovillo. dat. Roffae. 1516.</note>. At length ſome of our countrymen, the principal of which were Grocyn, Latymer, Lillye, Lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Tunſtall, Pace, and ſir Thomas More, ventured to break through the narrow bounds of ſcholaſtic erudition, and went over into Italy with a deſign of acquiring a knowledge in the Greek and Latin languages.<note n="c" place="bottom">Leland.

                  <p>It is not to be doubted, that William of Wykeham's am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple foundation at Wincheſter, formed on a plan perfectly ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and that of Henry vi. at Eton, its tranſcript, were very conducive, although diſtant, inſtruments in preparing and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating this great work. And indeed long before the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod at which we began, William of Wainflete, ſenſible of the expediency of grammar learning, had founded two conſiderable ſchools.—John Leland, or Leilont, taught grammar in Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water-inn at Oxford, of which he was principal, about the reign of Henry vi.

               </note>. And at the ſame time it is to be remarked, that Fox does not appoint a philoſophy-lecturer in his college, as had been the practice in moſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious foundations; perhaps thinking, that ſuch an inſtitution would not have coincided
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0379500700:157"/>
with his new ſyſtem of doctrine, and that it would be encouraging that ſpecies of ſcience which had hitherto blinded mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and kept them ſo long in ignorance of more uſeful knowledge. The greek lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is ordered to explain the beſt greek claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics; and thoſe which the judicious founder, who ſeems to have conſulted the moſt capital ſcholars of his age, preſcribes on this occaſion, are the pureſt, and ſuch as are moſt eſteemed at this day.</p>
            <p>Theſe happy beginnings were ſeconded by the munificence of cardinal Wolſed. About the year 1519, he founded a public chair at Oxford for rhetoric and humanity; and ſoon afterwards another for the greek tongue: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing both with ample ſtipends<note n="p" place="bottom">Wood Hiſt.

But theſe innovations in the plan of ſtudy were greatly diſcouraged and oppoſed by the ſcholaſtic bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, who called the greek language hereſy. Even biſhop Fox when he founded the greek lecture above-mentioned, was obliged to cover his excellent inſtitution under the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable mantle of the authority of the church, leſt ſhe ſhould ſeem to countenance a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous novelty.

Gregory Typhernas, one of the learned greek fugitives, about the year 1472, offered to teach greek in the univerſity of Paris, and aſked a ſtipend for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, under this canon.

The univerſity of Oxford was rent into factions on account of theſe attempts; and the defenders of the new erudition, from diſputations, often proceeded to blows with the rigid champions of the ſchools. But theſe animoſities were ſoon pacified by the perſuaſion and example of Eraſmus, who was about this time a ſtudent in ſaint Mary's college at Oxford, oppoſite to New-Inn<note n="r" place="bottom">Wood Hiſt.

greek grammar of Chryſoloras to the bare walls<note n="s" place="bottom">Epiſt. cxxiii. Ammonio dat. 1511. tom. iii. p. 140.

His edition of the greek teſtament was entirely proſcribed there; and a decree was iſſued in one of the moſt conſiderable colleges, ordering that if any of the ſociety was detected in bringing that impious and fantaſtic book into the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, he ſhould be ſeverely fined<note n="u" place="bottom">Epiſt. cxlviii. H. Bovillo. dat. 1513. Ibid. p. 126.</note>. One Henry Standiſh, a doctor in divinity and a mendicant frier, afterwards biſhop of ſaint Aſaph, was a vehement opponent of Eraſmus in this heretical literature; calling him in a declamation, by way of reproach, <hi>Graeculus iſte,</hi> which afterwards became a ſynonymous term for an heretic<note n="w" place="bottom">Knight's Life of Colet. p. 14.

            <p>But neither was Oxford, and for the ſame reaſons, entirely free from theſe contracted notions. In 1519, a preacher at ſaint Mary's church harangued with much violence againſt theſe pernicious teachers, and his arguments occaſioned no ſmall ferment among the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0379500700:160"/>
But Henry the eighth, who was luckily a patron of theſe improvements, being then reſident at the neighbouring royal manor of Woodſtock, and having received a juſt ſtate of the caſe from Pace and More, immediately tranſmitted his royal mandate to the univerſity, ordering that theſe ſtudies ſhoud not only be permitted but encouraged<note n="x" place="bottom">Eraſm. epiſt. ccclxxx. ut inf.</note>. Soon afterwards one of the king's chaplains preaching at court, took an opportunity to cenſure the new, but genuine, interpretations of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the grecian learning had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The king, when the ſermon was ended, which he heard with a ſmile of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ordered a ſolemn diſputation to be held, in the preſence of himſelf; at which the preacher oppoſed, and ſir Thomas More defended, the uſe and excellence of the greek tongue. The divine, inſtead of anſwering to the purpoſe, fell upon his knees, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged pardon for having given any offence in the pulpit. After ſome little altercation, the preacher, by way of a decent ſubmiſſion, declared that he was now better reconciled to the greek tongue, becauſe it was derived, from the hebrew.

Append. xxxv. pag. 94. ſeq.</note>. This was an uncommon qualification in a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</p>
            <p>At length ancient abſurdities univerſally gave way to theſe encouragements: and at Oxford in particular, theſe united efforts for eſtabliſhing a new ſyſtem of rational and manly learning were finally conſummated in the magnificent foundation of Wolſey's college, to which all the Learned of Europe were invited.</p>
            <p>But theſe auſpicious improvements in the ſtate of learning did not continue long. A change of the national religion ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0379500700:162"/>
and diſputes with the Lutherans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, which embroiling the minds of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in difference of opinion, diſunited their endeavours in the cauſe of literature, and diverted their attention to other enquiries.</p>
            <p>Many of the abuſes in civil ſociety are attended with ſome advantages. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of reformation, the loſs of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages is always felt very ſenſibly; while the benefit reſulting from the change, is the ſlow effect of time, and not immediately percieved or enjoyed. Scarce any inſtitution can be imagined leſs favorable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of mankind than the monaſtic. Yet a great temporary check given to the progreſs of literature at this period, was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the monaſteries. For although theſe ſeminaries were in general the nurſeries of illiterate indolence, and undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be deſtroyed, yet the ſtill contained invitations and opportunities to ſtudious lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and literary purſuits. On this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant event therefore, a viſible revolution and decline in the ſtate of learning ſucceeded. Moſt of the youth of the kingdom betook themſelves to mechanical or other illiberal employments, the profeſſion of letters being now ſuppoſed to be without ſupport and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0379500700:163"/>
By the abolition of the religious houſes, many towns and their adjacent vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages were utterly deprived of their only means of inſtruction. What was taught in the monaſteries was perhaps of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, but ſtill it ſerved to keep up a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of neceſſary knowledge. Hence provincial ignorance became almoſt univerſally eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould we forget, that ſeveral of the abbots were perſons of public ſpirit: by their connection with parliament, they became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the world; and knowing where and how to chuſe proper objects, and having no other uſe for the ſuperfluity of their vaſt revenues, encouraged, in their reſpective circles, many learned young men.</p>
            <p>It is generally thought, that the reformation of religion, the moſt happy and important event of modern times, was immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a flouriſhing ſtate of learning. But this, in England at leaſt, was by no means the caſe; and for a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was produced. Yet, in 1535, the king's viſitors ordered lectures in humanity to be founded in thoſe ſocieties at Oxford where they were yet wanting: and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0379500700:164"/>
theſe injunctions were ſo warmly ſeconded and approved by the ſcholars in the largeſt colleges, that they ſeized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus, and other irrefrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able logicians, and tearing them in pieces, diſperſed them in great triumph about their quadrangles, or gave them away as uſeleſs lumber<note n="a" place="bottom">See Dr. Layton's Letter to Cromwell.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they were judged proper inſtruments to be employed at the head of eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by way of making the reformation at once effectual. But unluckily this meaſure, ſpecious as it appeared at firſt, tended to draw the church into the contrary extreme. In the mean time their reluctance or abſolute refuſal to conform, in many inſtances, to the eſtabliſhed ceremonies, and their ſpeculative theology, tore the church into violent divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and occaſioned endleſs abſurd diſputes, unfavorable to the progreſs of real learning, and productive of an illiterate clergy, at leaſt unſkilled in liberal and manly ſcience.</p>
            <p>In fact, even the common eccleſiaſtical preferments had been ſo much diminiſhed by the ſeizure and alienation of impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the late depredations of the church, which were not yet ended, that few perſons were regularly bred to the church, or, in other words, received a learned education. Hence almoſt any that offered themſelves,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0379500700:170"/>
were without diſtinction admitted to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred function. Inſomuch, that in 1560, an injunction was directed to the biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from his metropolitan, ordering him to forbear ordaining any more artificers, and other unlearned perſons who had exerciſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occupations<note n="o" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Grindal. b. i. ch. 4. pag. 40.</note>. But as the evil was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, this caution took but little effect. About the year 1563, there were only two divines, the dean of Chriſt Church, and the preſident of Magdalene college, who were capable of preaching the public ſermons at Oxford<note n="p" place="bottom">Wood, ut ſupr. i. 285.</note>. Many proofs have been mentioned of the extreme ignorance of our clergy at this time: to which I ſhall add one, which is curious and new. In 1570, Horne biſhop of Wincheſter enjoined the Minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory, every week, one chapter of ſaint Paul's epiſtles in latin: and this taſk, beneath the abilities of an ordinary ſchool-boy, was actually repeated by ſome of them, before the biſhop, dean, and prebendaries, at a public epiſcopal viſitation of that church<note n="q" place="bottom">Regiſtr. Horne, Epiſcop. Winton. ſol. 80. b.</note>.</p>
            <p>The taſte for latin compoſition, and it was faſhionable both to write and ſpeak in that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0379500700:171"/>
language, was much worſe than in the reign of Henry the eighth, when juſter models were ſtudied. One is ſurprized to find the learned archbiſhop Grindal, in the ſtatutes of a ſchool which he founded and amply endowed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing ſuch ſtrange claſſics as Palingenius, Sedulius, and Prudentius, to be taught in the new ſeminary<note n="r" place="bottom">Strype's Life of Grindal. B. ii. ch. 17. pag. 312. This was A.D. 1583.</note>. Much has been ſaid about the paſſion for reading Greek which prevailed in this reign. But this affectation was confined to the queen, and a few others: and here it went no farther than oſtentation and pedantry. It was by no means the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſtudy; nor do we find that it improved the taſte, or influenced the writings, of that age. But I am wandering beyond the bounds which I firſt preſcribed to this neceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt add an obſervation or two. In government, many ſhocks muſt happen before the conſtitution is perfected. In like manner, it was late in the reign of Eliſabeth, before learning, after its ſinews had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed by frequent changes and commotions, recovered its proper tone, and roſe with new vigor, under the genial influence of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0379500700:172"/>
proteſtant religion. And it may be further remarked, that, as all novelties are purſued to exceſs, and the moſt beneficial improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments often introduce new inconveniencies, ſo this influx of polite literature deſtroyed philoſophy. On this account, ſir Henry Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, in the reign of James the firſt, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſors at Oxford for aſtronomy and geometry; becauſe, as he declares in the preamble of his ſtatutes, mathematical ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had been totally deſerted, and were then almoſt unknown in, England<note n="s" place="bottom">See Rym. Foed. xvii. 217. It is obſervable, that he entirely interdicted the teaching of judicial aſtrology to his profeſſor of Aſtronomy. Statut. Savil. cap. ii. Theſe ſtatutes are dated Aug. 11. 1619.</note>. Logic indeed remained; but that ſcience was ſtill cultivated, as being the baſis of polemical theology, and a neceſſary inſtrument for conducting our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies againſt the church of Rome.</p>

            <p>What was ſir Thomas Pope's laſt illneſs, or the particular circumſtances of his death, I have not found.

the north ile of the choir of Wallbrook church. Here was a vault, in which before had been buried his wife Margaret, his daughter Alice, and Anne Pope his ſiſter in law.

This monument was probably given by Elizabeth his ſecond wife in her life-time. It was certainly erected after his death, viz. after 1559, as the inſcription, which is wrought in large gothic characters out of the ſubſtance of the ſtone, minutely ſpecifies the date of his deceaſe. Elizabeth ſurvived her huſband more than thirty years; and, if at all, ſhe muſt have erected it before 1567, when it appears to have exiſted.

            <p>But I proceed to ſome other particulars concerning Dame Elizabeth Powlett. In the year 1560, ſhe placed in rich painted glaſs in a window of the choir, or chancell, of the church of Broadwell in Oxſordſhire, an image of the Holy Trinity, with the figures
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0379500700:216"/>
of herſelf and Sir Thomas Pope<note n="n" place="bottom">Probably the reaſon why ſhe did not place here the figure of her preſent huſband Sir Hugh Powlett, rather than that of Sir Thomas Pope, was becauſe this picture was intended as a memorial of the college to which the church belonged. In the large old manſion houſe at Filkins, a hamlet of Broadwell, pulled down about fifty years ago, there were on the ſpouts the initials E. P. for Eliſabeth Powlett, and the date 1592.</note>, both kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their heraldic ſurcoats of arms. But this window was removed or deſtroyed the following year by own her command, being cenſured as ſuperſtitious<note n="o" place="bottom">MSS. F. Wife.</note>. In the following year, ſhe gave a great clock to the late conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual church of Clerkenwell in London<note n="p" place="bottom">MSS. F. Wife.</note>. This was a conſiderable benefaction, and not unworthy to be mentioned here; as clocks, if of any ſize, were at that time uncommon and very expenſive. In 1564, ſhe placed a new pair of organs, with a picture of the Paſſion of Saint Sebaſtian, in the chapel of Tytten-hanger-houſe<note n="q" place="bottom">MSS. F. Wife. This article, and the two foregoing, I believe, were communicated to Mr. Wife by the late ſir Harry Pope-Blount, who ſeems to have had them from ſome family papers or memoirs.</note>. In the year 1592, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of perpetuating her affection to her native town of Burton upon Trent in Staffordſhire, by the memorial of ſome public benefaction, ſhe gave an annuity of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0379500700:217"/>
fifteen pounds iſſuing from her eſtate in Clerkenwell, and all her lands and poſſeſſions at Bentley in Derbyſhire, for improving the ſalaries of the firſt and ſecond maſters of the free-ſchool, and alſo for the perpetual main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of five poor women, aged and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, in that town<note n="q" place="bottom">Ex indentura, dat. 1 Feb. 35 Eliz. apud Burton praedict.

At length this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reſpectable lady having lived to a very great age, died the following year 1593, on the twenty-ſeventh day of October, at Tyttenhanger in Hertfordſhire<note n="r" place="bottom">From Wood's original Engliſh of <hi>Hiſtory and Antiquities of the Univerſity of Oxford,</hi> MSS.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0379500700:224"/>
frequently reprinted. But to ſay the truth, this little work is the voyage of a ſceptic: it has more of the philoſopher than the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, and would probably never have been written, but for the purpoſe of inſinuating his religious ſentiments. Yet his reflections are ſo ſtriking and original, and ſo artfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the thread of his adventures, that they enliven, inſtead of embarraſſing, the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. He has the plauſible art of colouring his paradoxes with the reſemblance of truth. So little penetration had the orthodox court of Charles the firſt, that merely on the merit of this book, he was appointed one of the band of Penſioners<note n="m" place="bottom">For ſome of his other pieces, ſee Wood's ATH. OXON. ii. 712. And Langbaine's DRAM. POETS, p. 327.</note>. Sir Thomas Pope-Blount his eldeſt ſon was born in 1649, and was educated under his father's inſpection. His CENSURA CELEBRIORUM AUTHORUM, which is a compilation of great erudition and labour, is well known to the critic and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary hiſtorian. Niceron unfortunately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the CENSURA with Baillet's JUGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT DES SAVANS<note n="n" place="bottom">MEMOIRES <hi>pour ſervir,</hi> &amp;c. tom. xxiii. p. 399.</note>. But Baillet has the vanity and injuſtice to report the opinions of other writers in his own words: our author has the modeſty and fidelity to tranſcribe and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0379500700:225"/>
to cite his authorities. His ESSAYS on vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects are learned and judicious, and they have the eaſe and freedom, without the ſingularity, of Montaigne. Another of his works, which has been ſuperſeded by thoſe who have uſed its materials, is REMARKS ON POETRY. Of this piece it will be ſufficient to ſay, that it was honoured with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of lord Mulgrave, the moſt elegant critic of the author's age. Charles Blount, or Pope-Blount, eſquire, ſecond ſon of ſir Henry abovementioned, inherited his father's philoſophy. From an abhorence of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, he appears to have adopted the moſt diſtant extremes of the theiſtic ſyſtem. His ANI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MA MUNDI, ORACLES OF REASON, LIFE OF APPOLLONIUS TYANAEUS, and DIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA OF THE EPHESIANS, written with great learning, ſagacity, wit, and force of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are the conſolation of infidels, and are melancholy monuments of admirable abilities abuſed in the defence of a futile but danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe<note n="o" place="bottom">See the MISCELLANEOUS WORKS of Charles Blount, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Charles Gildon in 1693.

Bayle has inaccurately repreſented the affecting ſtory of his death<note n="p" place="bottom">Artic. APOLLONIUS TYANAEUS. The true ſtory is this. Mr. Blount, on the death of his wife, fell in love with her ſiſter, a lady of great beauty and accompliſhments: ſhe was not inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his attachment, but was ſcrupulous about the legality of marrying her ſiſter's late huſband. On his application to the moſt learned civilians, and the archbiſhop of Canterbury, he was informed, that ſuch a match could not take place. On this, the lady poſitively refuſed her conſent, and Mr. Blount in a fit of deſpair ſhot himſelf through the head. The wound not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately proving mortal, he lived five days: during which time, he received no fuſtenance or medicines but from the hands of the lady, who attended him with the moſt ſympathetic ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs till his laſt moments. This account I received from the late ſir Harry Pope-Blount, baronet, the laſt of the family, and a diligent and faithful antiquary.</note>.</p>

I cloſe my account of Dame Elizabeth Powlett, and her nearer relations, with a few words concerning the antiquity and dignity of her family. Its anceſtor was Le Blound lord of Guiſnes in Normany, whoſe ſons Robert and William le Blound, both entered Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with William the conqueror. William was one of the captains in that expedition, and quartered, with other Norman knights, on the monks of Ely. Robert was created by the conqueror, baron of Ixworth in Suffolk; in which county he received a grant of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen lordſhips. Gilbert, his ſon, founded an Auguſtine priory at Ixworth, in the reign of William Rufus, which he endowed with fourteen knights fees. One of Gilbert's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants was killed at the battle of Lewes,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0379500700:227"/>
in the reign of Henry the third, where he was ſtandard-bearer to Mountford earl of Leiceſter. In the progreſs of it's deſcent, this family numbers many perſons of ſingular eminence and high ſtation<note n="q" place="bottom">See Peacham's COMPLEAT GENTLEMAN, edit. 1661. pag. 230. And Eng. Baronet. iv. 665. 675. 576. And ii. 367.</note>; and is, beſides, nobly connected by marriages. On the ſides of the tomb in Trinity college chapel above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, are two coats: Pope impaling Quarterings of Blount, viz. Barry, Nebule of ſix, Or, and ſable; And of Roger de Sutton, anceſtor of Elizabeth's mother, viz. A lyon rampant. This is one coat. The other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of quarterings of Blount, Of the ſaid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger de Sutton; and, Of Nicholas de Wichard lord of the manor of Oſberſton aforeſaid in the reign of Henry the third, marrying into the ſaid Roger, viz.

Theſe arms are an additional and evident proof, that Dame Elizabeth Powlett erected this monument; in decorating which, ſhe was ſo ſtudious to introduce the enſigns and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of her own family<note n="s" place="bottom">There is an old portrait of lady Powlett, in the Burſary at Trinity college, painted, as I judge from the drapery and the age of the countenance, about the middle of Q. Eliſabeth's reign; by which ſhe appears to have been handſome. This picture was in the college at leaſt before 1613. It is mentioned in Comp. Burſſ. coll. 1612.—13. I have been told that this picture was painted by ſir Antonio More, portrait and hiſtory painter to Philip and Mary. Several of his pictures were in the collection of king Charles the firſt, and at ſir Philip Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's at Brympton in Somerſetſhire, a family (as we have ſeen) nearly related to Lady Powlett. More had one hundred ducats for his common portraits. He died in 1575. I rather think this picture is a copy of an original by More.</note>.<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0379500700:228"/>

            <p>IT may be neceſſary to ſpeak of ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pope's friends, and of thoſe with whom he ſeems to have maintained any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intimacy, connection, or intercourſe: notwithſtanding moſt of their names have before occurred incidentally.

            <p>I need not repeat his laſt interview with ſir THOMAS MORE: of whom it will be ſufficient to add here, that he was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ornament of the Engliſh nation at the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of polite literature; that he was a

lord Audley. But although by his perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the buſineſs of the Divorce, and the diſſolution of the monaſteries, he ſo gratified the kings private views, as <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to ſuſtain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own declaration, much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and infamy;"</q> yet the beſt hiſtorians admit, that he oppoſed the dangerous deſigns of his arbitrary maſter in a matter of the higheſt importance. In 1539, many ſevere acts were made, in which thoſe ſtyled the ſix bloody articles were included; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative was carried to ſuch an enormous height, that the king's proclamation was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to attain the force of a law. It does not very plainly appear who were his majeſty's principal counſellors in this affair: but we are aſſured, by concurrent and undoubted authorities, that the rigorous execution of thoſe laws which the king had at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was prevented by the ſpirited inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of lord Audley<note n="d" place="bottom">See BIOGRAPH.

That ſir Thomas Pope was nearly connected with CARDINAL POLE, appears from paſſages in his letters.

ſir Thomas Pope was connected with THIRL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BY, biſhop of Ely<note n="p" place="bottom">See alſo Append. Numb. xix.</note>. He was conſtituted the firſt, and only biſhop of Weſtminſter by Henry the eighth<note n="q" place="bottom">Burnet, Ref. <hi>Records.</hi> i. 246.</note>. He was, by Edward the ſixth, tranſlated to Norwich, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by queen Mary to Ely; by whom he was alſo appointed a privy counſellor<note n="r" place="bottom">Goodwyn, ut ſupr. p. 333.</note>, and joined in commiſſion with ſir Thomas Pope and others for the ſuppreſſion of heretics<note n="s" place="bottom">See ſupr. p. 52.</note>. By all theſe princes he was much eſteemed for his experience in political affairs, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently employed as an envoy to foreign courts. In the reign of Elizabeth he was ejected and impriſoned for perſevering in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; but was afterwards received into the family of archbiſhop Parker, who, not more on account of his former dignity, than of his learning, candor, and affability, treated him with due reſpect and humanity<note n="t" place="bottom">Goodwyn, ubi ſupr.</note>. WHYTE, biſhop of Wincheſter, became the firſt viſitor of Trinity college in Oxford. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that ſir Thomas Pope's real motive for appointing the biſhops of Wincheſter to be viſitors of his college,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0379500700:255"/>
originated from Gardiner, who was the biſhop of Wincheſter when the foundation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and who, moreover, had been gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a college at Cambridge; was now chancellor of that univerſity, a learned civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, a ſcholar of the firſt rank, an eminent patron of literature<note n="u" place="bottom">Gardiner's literary character has been commonly overlooked in his political, and is rarely regarded or acknowledged. He was admirably ſkilled in the Greek language, at a time when it was cultivated in England only by a few neglected ſcholars. His ideas of pure Latinity were refined to a fault; and he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his notions of the chaſte Roman phraſeology to ſuch a nicety, as to be eſteemed a Ciceronian by his cotemporaries. Leland, the moſt polite claſſical writer in England at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, congratulates ſome of his elegant friends, on their being educated in the college over which Gardiner preſided at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge; and which, under ſuch a governor, had become the ſeat of eloquence and of the choir of the Muſes. Leland alſo characteriſes Gardiner by the epithet DISERTUS, or the maſter of genuine Latinity; and calls him the reſtorer of claſſical compoſition, and the ſtudy of philology, at Cambridge. EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COM. p. 100. edit. 1589. Leland paid theſe compliments before Gardiner was a biſhop, and when there were no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to flattery. Many of Aſcham's terſe Latin epiſtles are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to this prelate: in which, his diſtinguiſhed learning, his ſollicitude for the revival of ancient letters, and his general pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, are repeatedly diſplayed in the higheſt yet unaffected terms of panegyric. In one of theſe, Aſcham expreſſes his great ſatisfaction, that Gardiner, who excells all others in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſcernment, had ſo warmly approved his TOXOPHILUS, then juſt publiſhed, and written with a view to teach a juſt Engliſh ſtyle; and deſires that the biſhop, <hi>pro eo amore quo lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras et earum cultores unice amplecteris,</hi> would recommend that book to the king. Lib. ii. p. 85. b. edit. 1581. In another, he thanks the biſhop for honouring him with ſo many marks of notice and attention, when he came, an unknown and obſcure academic, to court. He recommends a tutor to the duke of Norfolk's nephew; and wiſhes that Gardiner, who is ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a judge and protector of literary merit, would ratify the choice. Ibid. p. 92. a. In a third, lamenting the untimely death of king Edward the ſixth, he petitions Gardiner among other requeſts, to intercede with queen Mary, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his penſion originally granted by king Henry the eighth, as a reward for his TOXOPHILUS: profeſſing his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the biſhop's known erudition, authority, liberality, prudence, and activity, to quiet the diſtractions which not only the civil but literary ſtate of the kingdom would probably ſuffer, from that unexpected and calamitous event. Ibid. p. 154. b. Dat. 1553. In the next, he preſents the biſhop, then juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from impriſonment in the TOWER at the acceſſion of Mary, with a Greek TRANSLATION of the PSALMS, probably the METAPHRASE of APOLLINARIUS: enforcing the propriety of his preſent by obſerving, that it was written in a language in which the biſhop ſo much delighted, and that poetry had been his chief amuſement during the tedious hours of his late confinement. Ibid. p. 157. b. See alſo, p. 65. a. With the next, dated 1554, as a ſlender remembrance of the numerous favors he had recently received, he ſends the biſhop an antient golden Roman coin. Ibid. p. 163. a. In three or four others, evidently written during the reign of Mary, he complains of many unjuſt taxations and oppreſſive exactions, impoſed by ſome late innovators on the univerſity of Cambridge; ſupplicating the aſſiſtance of Gardiner as their CHANCELLOR, and expatiating largely on his accuſtomed indefatigable endeavours to ſupport the rights and promote the honour of the univerſity. Ibid. p. 194. b. ſeq. In another letter, to one of Margaret Roper's learned daughters, dated 1554, Aſcham ſpeaks of being called from Cambridge by the ſpecial favour and appointment of biſhop Gardiner, to ſerve the queen in the very liberal office of Latin ſecretary. Ibid. p. 162. b. In a letter to the learned Sturmius, dated at Greenwich 1555, he declares, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I would not exchange the Office of Latin Secretary for any ſituation in life. Biſhop Gardiner has treated me with the greateſt kindneſs and indulgence in this affair: and I can hardly ſay, whether Lord Pagett has ſhewn more readineſs in naming me to the queen, or the biſhop in pleading my cauſe and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending my character. There are ſome who have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtop the courſe of the biſhop's benevolence, on account of my religious principles, but without effect. I therefore am deeply indebted to his humanity, and it is a debt which I willingly owe. I am indeed but one among many who have experienced his generoſity. I have often thought of talking to him about your noble work of the ANALYTICS. For I well know his predilection to polite letters, and think his patronage would be of ſervice on this occaſion, &amp;c."</q> Ibid. p. 45. b. ſeq. It appears alſo, that Gardiner procured from queen Mary for Aſcham, a renewal of the royal penſion for his TOXOPHILUS, with the annual addition of ten pounds. IBID. ibid. p. 45. b. And Grant's VITA, p. 21. Aſcham's LATIN. EPIST. edit. Oxon 1703. By the ſame intereſt, Aſcham was ſuffered to keep his fellowſhip and public orator's place at Cambridge, during a long abſence from the univerſity, while he was Latin ſecretary and abroad in Germany. Ibid. p. 22. Nor was Aſcham the only learned proteſtant whom Gardiner countenanced in the reign of queen Mary. Throughout the perſecutions of that unhappy period, he permitted Sir Thomas Smith, one of the reſtorers of Greek, and ſecretary of ſtate in the reign of Edward the ſixth, to enjoy the comforts of a ſtudious retirement with a penſion of one hundred pounds. Strype's SMITH, p 60. ſeq. I forbear to enlarge on Gardiner's high celebrity as a civilian and canoniſt: and ſhall only add on that head, that Henry the eighth would take no ſtep in the buſineſs of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, however eager for a deciſion, till Gardiner could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, who was abſent at Rome.

            <p>But among his friends I muſt not forget to mention THOMAS SLYTHURSTE<note n="t" place="bottom">See more of him in Append. Numb. XXV.</note>, whom he appointed the firſt Preſident of his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; and had before probably preferred, by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0379500700:264"/>
his intereſt with the queen, to a canonry of Windſor. He ſeems to have conceived a high opinion of Slythurſte's learning and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; whom, from the truſt committed to his charge, we reaſonably may imagine to have been a perſon of diſtinguiſhed worth and abilities. In a general Addreſs to the new ſociety, annexed to the ſtatutes of the college, he particularly compliments the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident for his remarkable moderation of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his eminent learning, experience, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and probity; obſerving moreover, in juſtification of his choice, that he ſhould have acted in vain, if he had not added to the benefit of his foundation ſuch a governor, ſo properly qualified in every requiſite accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; one completely fitted for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and critical taſk of conducting the firſt beginnings of a recent inſtitution, and to whom therefore, borrowing the character of a father in that of a founder, he with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure entruſted the education of his children. On various occaſions, ſir Thomas Pope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have placed the greateſt confidence in his friendſhip, advice, and judgement. Many of the founder's letters to Slythurſte contain free conſultations about adjuſting the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0379500700:265"/>
endowment, amending the ſtatutes<note n="u" place="bottom">In the firſt copy of the ſtatutes, dated 1556, ſigned by the founder, are ſeveral eraſures and interlineations in the hand of Slythurſte, made by the conſent and authority of the founder: and the text of this copy thus corrected, is that which is now in uſe. Many of theſe alterations appear to have been made in this book, between them both at Tyttenhanger, or Clerken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, as I collect from a letter from the founder to the vice-preſident, dat. 28. Jan. 1557, in which he ſays, that he ſhall ſend by the preſident, an altered and improved copy of his ſtatutes, which he had ordered to be forthwith ingroſſed in parchment. In another letter to the preſident, dat. 25. Feb. 1557, the founder tells him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I truſt ye will not forget to make an INDEX CAPITULORUM STATUTORUM, which we forgott when we were together."</q> In this copy, corrected by Slythurſte's hand, <hi>London,</hi> the place from which they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally dated, is ſtruck out for TYTTENHANGER. The <hi>altered and improved copy,</hi> mentioned above, ingroſſed on parchment, and ſigned with his own hand throughout, with the ADDITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT annexed, appears to have been delivered to the ſociety, but with the original date of 1556 preſerved, in, or ſoon after, April, 1558.

I find him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſiting the founder at Clerkenwell and Tyttenhanger. The ſudden revolution, however, of religion, at the acceſſion of queen Elizabeth, prevents us from knowing much more of his chaaracter and behaviour in this ſituation: for in September, 1559, he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0379500700:266"/>
was ejected from his headſhip by the Queen's viſitors, and committed a priſoner to the Tower of London; where he died of grief, 1560, partly for the death of his honored friend and munificent patron the founder, and partly for the loſs of his preferments.</p>

            <p>AN anecdote equally ridiculous and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, has been propagated by Antony Wood, highly injurious to the honor of ſir THOMAS POPE; which, notwithſtanding it appears at firſt ſight ſtrongly to confute itſelf, I ſhall here examine and diſprove<note n="a" place="bottom">Although poſſeſſed of the proper information and evidence, I had long ago, and for many reaſons reſolved, never to enter into a particular diſcuſſion of this idle calumny. But as, ſince the appearance of my firſt edition of this work, it has been circulated both in converſation, and by more biographers than one, as a pleaſant ancedote, I could no longer forbear uſing the means in my power of expoſing its falſity and futility.</note> It origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from Henry Cuffe, the famous ſecretary of the unfortunate earl of Eſſex, who was executed, ſoon after his maſter, in 1601.</p>
            <p>Cuffe, being a boy of the moſt promiſing abilities and uncommon proficiency in litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was ſent at fifteen years of age, by Lady Elizabeth Powlett, often mentioned above, from Hinton ſaint George in Somerſetſhire, to Trinity college in Oxford, where he was elected ſcholar on the twentyfifth of May,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0379500700:268"/>
1578<note n="b" place="bottom">REGISTR. PRIM. fol. 37. b.</note>. Within five years he was admitted fellow, May 30, 1583<note n="c" place="bottom">Ibid. fol. 42.</note>. But even in this ſituation, the ſame diſcontented and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſpirit, which afterwards hurried him to an ignominious end, could not be ſuppreſſed. Soon after his admiſſion, when he was now not more than twenty years of age, and in the year of his probation, he endeavoured to defame his founder by a falſe inſinuation, which ſavored alike of petulance and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and which, had it been true, deſerved animadverſion. The matter being reported to Lady Powlett the foundreſs, ſhe tranſmitted a mandate to the college, ordering him to be inſtantly removed from his fellowſhip. This we learn from the words of the college regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Reſignante</hi> CUFFO, <hi>et locum Litteris Fundatricis dante</hi>

In the ATHENAE he ſays, that Cuffe <q rend="inline margQuotes">"was forced to reſign his fellowſhip of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity college, for ſpeaking certain matters though true, which redounded to the <hi>great diſcredit</hi> of the FOUNDER<note n="e" place="bottom">ATHEN.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0379500700:269"/>
reſerve, and produces his authority. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Doctor Bathurſt told me that our Cuffe was of Trinity college, and expelled from thence upon this account: the founder, ſir Thomas Pope, would, wherſoever he he went viſiting his friend, <hi>ſteal</hi> one thing or other he could lay his hands on, put it in his pocket, or under his gown. This was ſuppoſed rather an <hi>humour</hi> than of <hi>diſhoneſty.</hi> Now Cuffe, upon a time, with his fellows being merry, ſaid, a pox this is a poor beggarly college indeed, the plate that our founder ſtole would build ſuch another, which coming to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's ears, he was thereupon ejected<note n="f" place="bottom">See Hearne's LIB. NIG. SCAC. p. 593.</note>."</q> The reader muſt have already noticed the glaring inconſiſtency of theſe two curious narratives. In the firſt, ſir Thomas Pope, is by implication at leaſt, repreſented as a thief: in the next, his diſhoneſty is ſoftened into humour and jocularity. That the whole is a miſrepreſentation, and a jumble of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, appears from an original paper in the hand-writing of Doctor Bathurſt. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Secretary Cuffe was expelled from a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Trinity college, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Our founder, when upon a viſit, would often carry away a ſilver cup under

his gown for the joke-ſake, ſending it back the next day to laugh at his friend. Cuffe being merry at ANOTHER COLLEGE with ſome of his boon companions, ſaid, <hi>A pox this is a beggarlie college indeed, the plate that our founder ſtole would build another as good.</hi> Theſe words being told to the Preſident, he was ejected. This I have often heard from my predeceſſour doctor preſident Kettell who was contemporarie with Cuffe<note n="g" place="bottom">BATHURST PAPERS, MSS. In the poſſeſſion of the late Mr. Payne, canon of Wells.</note>."</q> In the margin, Bathurſt has recorded the name of the other college, which Cuffe was pleaſed to treat in ſuch terms of contempt, and which needs not here to be mentioned. Indeed, it was no part of the accuſation againſt Cuffe, that, as Wood's context inſinuates, his pleaſantry led him to depreciate the buildings of his founder: but that he wantonly converted one of his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal jokes, a ſpecies of humour not uncommon among our feſtive anceſtors, into a petty larceny. On the whole, we now perceive that Wood has inaccurately related this ſtory from a caſual converſation with Bathurſt, which he remembered as imperfectly. As to Cuffe, I know not whether he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at Oxford after this ejection. But
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0379500700:271"/>
having great addreſs, and much real merit, about three years afterwards, that is in the year 1586, he was choſen fellow of Merton college. Being an admirable Grecian, he was about the ſame time made profeſſor of Greek in the univerſity. It was in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, that he aſſiſted Columbanius in the firſt edition of Longus's elegant PASTORAL ROMANCE, which was printed at Florence in 1598<note n="h" place="bottom">COLL. MSS. T. Hearne, vol. xiii. p. 236. Columbanius ſays in the Dedication, p. ii. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Qua in re operam mihi ſuam, non ingratam iliam quidem, navarunt viri omnium literatiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi atque officioſiſſimi Herricus CUFFUS Anglus, &amp;c."</q>
               </note>. He was no leſs eminent as a logician and a diſputant. His intimate friend Camden, to whoſe BRITANNIA, at its firſt appearance, he prefixed an excellent Greek epigram, characterizes Cuffe, as a man of exquiſite learning and genius, but of a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and perverſe temper<note n="l" place="bottom">Camd. ELIZ. p. 869. edit. Hearn.</note>. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſevere check he received at Trinity college, he generouſly preſented to the library there ſeveral volumes. Perhaps ſome readers will be candid enough to think, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion from this ſociety was rather owing to an unguarded vivacity of diſpoſition, than to any malignity of mind. Our hiſtorians ſay, that the earl of Eſſex, who began, after a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0379500700:272"/>
tedious confinement, to feel the dangers of his ſituation, diſmiſſed Cuffe from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and family, for turbulence and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<note n="k" place="bottom">Camden, ubi ſupr. p. 827. 833.</note>. Eſſex was unfortunate in not having before perceived theſe qualities, in a man who ſhared ſo much of his confidence.</p>

            <p>FROM a recapitulation of what has been ſaid, the following character of ſir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS POPE ariſes. He appears to have been a man eminently qualified for buſineſs; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not employed in the very principal departments of ſtate, he poſſeſſed peculiar talents and addreſs for the management and execution of public affairs. His natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were ſtrong, his knowledge of the world deep and extenſive, his judgment ſolid and diſcerning. His circumſpection and prudence in the conduct of negociations entruſted to his charge, were equalled by his fidelity and perſeverance. He is a conſpicuous inſtance of one, not bred to the church, who without the advantages of birth and patrimony, by the force of underſtanding and induſtry, raiſed himſelf to opulence and honorable employments. He lived in an age when the peculiar circumſtances of the times afforded obvious temptations to the moſt abject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of principle: and few periods of our hiſtory can be found, which exhibit more numerous examples of occaſional compliance
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0379500700:274"/>
with frequent changes. Yet he remained unbiaſſed and uncorrupted amid the general depravity. Under Henry the eighth, when on the diſſolution of the monaſteries, he was enabled by the opportunities of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enrich himſelf with their revenues by fraudulent or oppreſſive practices, he behaved with diſintereſted integrity; nor does a ſingle inſtance occur upon record which impeaches his honor. In the ſucceeding reign of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſixth, a ſudden check was given to his career of popularity and proſperity: he retained his original attachment to the catholic religion; and on that account, loſt thoſe marks of favor or diſtinction which were ſo liberally diſpenſed to the ſycophants of Somerſet, and which he might have eaſily ſecured by a temporary ſubmiſſion to the reigning ſyſtem. At the acceſſion of Mary, he was reſtored to favor; yet he was never inſtrumental or active in the tyrannies of that queen which diſgrace our annals. He was armed with diſcretionary powers for the ſuppreſſion of heretical innovations; yet he forbore to gratify the arbitrary demands of his bigotted miſtreſs to their utmoſt extent, nor would he participate in forwarding the barbarities of her bloody perſecutions. In the guardianſhip of the princeſs Elizabeth,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0379500700:275"/>
the unhappy victim of united ſuperſtition, jealouſy, revenge and cruelty, his humanity prevailed over his intereſt; and he leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the diſpleaſure of the vigilant and unforgiving queen, than the claims of injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed innocence. If it be his crime to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated riches, let it be remembered, that he conſecrated a part of thoſe riches, not amid the terrors of a death-bed, nor in the dreams of old age, but in the prime of life, and the vigour of underſtanding, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice of his country; that he gave them to future generations, for the perpetual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of literature and religion.</p>

Part of it was rented by Bernard College, now ſaint John's. Bernard college was diſſolved by Henry the eighth, who gave the ſaid college and its appurtenances, together with a part, called <hi>half,</hi> of Durham college grove, to his new cathedral of Chriſt church, 1545. This part, or <hi>half,</hi> I preſume, was <hi>that</hi> which had been rented, as above, by Bernard college, and was therefore conſidered, at the time of this donation, as its uſual appendage. In the year 1555. ſir Thomas Whyte, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing from Chriſt-church the ſaid Bernard college, purchaſed likewiſe of the ſame, the part or <hi>half</hi> of Durham college grove above-mentioned. This part, or <hi>half,</hi> is what now makes the outer grove, and perhaps much more, of ſaint John's college. See Wood, Hiſt. Ant. ii. 252.—Stevens, Monaſt. ii. 53. Wood, MSS. Muſ. Aſhm. 8513.—And eſpecially, Numb. VII. Append. Thus the outlet, or <hi>grove,</hi> in the text, included only what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to Durham college after the aforeſaid aliena ion made by Henry the eighth. When Trinity college and ſaint John's were founded, the two founders jointly erected the ſtone wall which now ſeparates the groves, or gardens, of the two col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. That this was done by agreement between them both, I collect from the words of a letter from ſir Thomas Pope, to the preſident, dat. Jul. xxiv. 1557, in which, he deſires the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to beſpeak for him, a certain large quantity of ſtone, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"for ſo much I think I ſhall occupie <hi>for my part</hi> of Mr. [ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas] White's wall."</q> Afterwards, ſir T. Pope ſurrounded the whole grove of Trinity college with a ſtone-wall: and I find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended thereon cxx,<hi>l.</hi> The ſtone was purchaſed of William Freere of Oxford, who, with Agnes his wife, got poſſeſſion of the houſes called Dominican and Franciſcan Friers at Oxford, ſoon after their diſſolution, and demoliſhing the buildings fold the materials. See LIFE, p. 125. And Wood, Hiſt. Antiq. Univ. Oxon. lib. i. pag. 66. col. 2. William's elder brother Edward was afterwards ſettled at Water-Eaton near Oxford. Arms in the windows of the houſe of Mr. Freer, at Oxford, are deſcribed by Lee, 1575. ARMS, &amp;c. Muſ. Aſhmol. MSS. Codd. A. Wood. D. 14.</note>:

                     <p>On the whole it appears, that <hi>Simon,</hi> fellow of Magdalene college, mentioned in this inſtrument, who married <hi>Eliſabeth Love,</hi> was the perſon whoſe name occurs in papers and accounts (See LIFE, 183.) at the foundation of Trinity college, and who was the founder's agent.</p>
                     <p>The manor of Northleigh aforeſaid, being parcel of Nettley abbey in Hampſhire, was granted to ſir Thomas Pope and his heirs in the year 1545, by patent of Henry the eighth, anno regn. 36. Jul. 28. par. 8. From him it deſcended to his widow dame Eliſabeth. Late in the reign of queen Eliſabeth, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been veſted in the deſcendants of Robert Parrot, or rather Perrot, abovementioned; whoſe ſon Simon, as we have ſeen, married Eliſabeth Love, ſir Thomas Pope's niece. Wood [Ath. Oxon. i. Faſt. 23. ut ſupr.] is miſtaken in ſaying, that the ſaid Robert, the founder of this family in Oxfordſhire, was the ſecond ſon of George Perrot of Haroldſton near Haver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford weſt in Pembrokſhire. It is proved from better authority, that he was born at Hacknes in the North riding of Yorkſhire. MS. REGISTR. PARROT, ut ſupr. fol. 111. b.

                        <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> When this perſon was removed from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, the founder intended, partly on the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of cardinal Pole, to place in his room the learned William Alan, a name equally celebrated among the catholics, and proſcribed by the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. But that deſign did not take effect: he being promoted about the ſame time, and probably by the intereſt of ſir Thomas Pope, to a canonry in the cathedral of York<note n="o" place="bottom">MSS. F. Wiſe, ut ſupr.</note>. Alan was an able controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſialiſt in defence of the declining doctrines of the church of Rome: educated at Oriel college, and about the year 1556, appointed Principal of ſaint Mary's HALL, and elected one of the proctors of the univerſity of Oxford. Upon the acceſſion of queen Eliſabeth, he retired to Louvain, where he wrote his famous book on PURGATORY and PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD, which abounds in rhetoric more than argument, and contains much ingenious decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſophiſtry. Soon afterwards he returned to England, where he publiſhed many ſpecious apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies for his religion, which he diſperſed with great art and induſtry. But the treatiſe juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0379500700:429"/>
was the baſis of his polemical reputation. As he wrote chiefly for the conviction of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, moſt of his compoſitions are in Engliſh; and are not inelegant ſpecimens of ſtyle, at a time when the ſtate of our language was rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled. A ſolid old Engliſh critic pronounces one of Alan's tracts to be <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a princely, grave, and flouriſhing piece of natural and exquiſite Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh<note n="p" place="bottom">Bolton's HYPERCRIT. iv. §. 2.</note>."</q> Being again driven abroad, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a canonry in each of the churches of Cambray and Rheims. At length ſtanding high in the eſteem of pope Sixtus the fifth, he was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a Cardinal, and archbiſhop of Mechlin in Brabant<note n="q" place="bottom">Wood, ATH.

It is not the leaſt of his dignities, and it is a proof of the univerſality of his literature, that he was librarian of the Vatican<note n="r" place="bottom">Miraeus, SCRIPT.

He was a principal inſtrument in eſtabliſhing the Engliſh catholic ſeminaries at Doway and Rheims, and ſeveral others in Spain and Italy. His intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate papiſtic zeal, which he imprudently carried into the dangerous politics of the times, and which prompted him to circulate ſeditious papers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to prepare the way for the Spaniſh invaſion, was cenſured even by thoſe of his own intolerant perſuaſion.

It is beautifully written on vellum in folio; and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally belonged to Robert Groſthead biſhop of Lincoln in the thirteenth century, in whoſe hand are many notes in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. Groſthead gave it to the convent of Friars Minors at Oxford. Theſe Friars gave it to the famous theologiſt Thomas Gaſcoigne, under their ſeal, about the year 1433. Gaſcoigne preſented it to Durham college at Oxford, and at length Allen placed it in the Bodleian library. At the end of this manuſcript there is a long note written by Gaſcoigne, which Tanner has printed, Bibl. p. 311. All the books belonging to the library of Richard de Bury in Durham college, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed ſoon after the diſſolution of that houſe. Some were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the Humfredian library, and others to Baliol college; but the greater part became the property of Doctor Owen, to whom Durham college was granted. Archbiſhop Parker pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured many Saxon manuſcripts of Doctor Owen. In the Cotton library, there is a volume conſiſting of a collection of charters, and other antient writings, tranſcribed by Jocelyn, Parker's chaplain: who has inſerted this note at many of the pieces. <hi>The archbiſhop of Canterbury had this charter from Dr. Owen.</hi> At ſome others, <hi>The copy of this Dr. Tallot had of Dr. Owen.</hi> VI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TELL. D. 7. Robert Talbot, the annotator on Antoninus, was employed by the archbiſhop to collect antient manuſcripts, chiefly Saxon. Many of Parker's books, now in Bennet college library at Cambridge, appear to have belonged to Talbot. The archbiſhop's principal collector was Bateman, another of his chaplains; who ſays, that he <q rend="inline margQuotes">"gathered within four years, under his graces commiſſion, ſix thouſand ſeven hundred books."</q> Bateman's DOOM <hi>warning all men to judgment, &amp;c.</hi> Lond. 1581. 4to. pag. 400.

I ſhould ſpeak here of Bury. This prelate was one of the earlieſt Engliſh reſtorers of literature. Of his PHILOBIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LON, I have ſpoken at large in the SECOND DISSERTATION prefixed to the firſt volume of the HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY. He held ſome of the higheſt offices both in church and ſtate under Edward the third, whoſe education he had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintended. In the year 1331, he was ſent by that king to Avignon, to negotiate ſome buſineſs with the pope. Rymer, FOED. ii. 59. He there lodged in the houſe of cardinal Colonne, where Petrarch at that time alſo reſided. Petrarch embraced the fortunate opportunity of conſulting this learned Engliſhman, then only a private eccleſiaſtic, about the ſituation of the antient Thule, ſuppoſed to be one of the Britiſh iſlands: for the geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy of antiquity was one of Petrarch's favorite ſtudies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without his books, of which he had amaſſed a prodigious collection, he promiſed to tranſmitt to Petrarch the beſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation he could obtain on this ſubject, after his return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. What had immediately given riſe to Petrarch's curioſity about this iſland, probably was Giraldus's fabulous account of Thule, in his MIRABILIA HIBERNIAE, a work juſt publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and recently tranſlated into French by John of Meun, author of the <hi>Romaunt de la Roſe.</hi> Petrarch wrote frequently to Richard of Bury to know the reſult of his promiſed enquiries about Thule: but, perhaps in conſequence of Bury's important occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, never received any anſwer. See Petrarchae EPISTOL. iii. 1. In this epiſtle, Petrarch calls Bury, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Virum ardentis ingenii nec literarum inſcium, abditarumque rerum ſupra fidem curioſum."</q> The ingenious author of LA VIE DE PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRARQUE, thinks that Petrarch's letters to Bury are now in ſome library of England.

Leland and his tranſcriber Trithemius are miſtaken in what they have aſſerted about Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch's correſpondence with this prelate. From what is here ſaid, may be alſo corrected two ſlight miſtakes in the French ENCYCLOPEDE, under the article BIBLIOTHEQUE.</p>

                              <p>To recur to the firſt part of this note. There is a curious paſſage in Eraſmus's Annotations on the New Teſtament, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the year 1512, which admirably diſplays the ſtate of our church-muſic, juſt before the Reformation, EPIST.

And for this purpoſe, ample ſalaries are expended on organiſts, and ſocieties of boys, whoſe whole time is waſted in learning to ſing. Not to mention the vaſt revenues which the church ſquanders away in the ſtipends of ſinging-men, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly great drunkards, buffoons, and choſen from the loweſt of the people. Theſe fooleries are become ſo agreeable, that the monks, eſpecially in ENGLAND, think of nothing elſe.

               <p>For from what is here collected on this ſubject, it muſt appear, that our great poet, ALEXANDER POPE, was related to this family only by ſome colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral branch. I have mentioned all the male iſſue, and their marriages; except the marriages of John
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0379500700:475"/>
and William, two younger ſons of ſir William Pope knight, of Cogges: both which, I ſuſpect, died young; but if ever married, either of them may reaſonably be ſuppoſed rather too young<note n="s" place="bottom">The eldeſt of them, John, was born Nov. 2, 1623. If it can be proved that he was the father of the elder Alexander Pope, it will follow that Thomas Pope, ſecond earl of Downe, was his uncle: and conſequently, that ſir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity college, was the poet's uncle, to a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. It may perhaps be trifling to mention, that ALEXANDER POPE occurs twice as a name in this family, in, and about, Temp. Edw. iii.—MSS. Pedigr. penes honoratiſſ. com. de Guildford.</note> to have been the father of the elder Alexander Pope, who was born 1642<note n="t" place="bottom">Ex Epitaphio.</note>. Beſides, had the poet been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from either of theſe two younger ſons, the title of earl of Downe could not have failed during his own and his father's life-time. Mr. Pope tells us, that, his <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Father [Alexander] was of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's family in Oxfordſhire, the head of which was the earl of Downe, whoſe ſole heireſs married the earl of Lindſey. His mother was the daughter of W. Turnor of York: She had three brothers, one of whom was killed, anothes died in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of king Charles."</q> Notwithſtanding what I have here ſaid, I imagine that Mr. Pope alludes to Thomas Pope the ſecond earl of Downe, whoſe epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph I have given, no leſs than to his mother's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the following lines.<q>
                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:0379500700:476"/>

               </p>
               <p>And on the whole from my reſearches on this head I am inclined to determine, that our poet was deſcended from a branch of this family, viz.

Dr. Ralph Kettel was preſident of Trinity college, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent governor, for near fifty years. He had been fellow and ſcholar of the college for fourteen years, during the life-time of this lady. His family lived in her neighbourhood, at King's Langley in Hertfordſhire. She probably ſent him to the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, where he was admitted ſcholar, Jun. 16, 1579. Regiſtr. prim. fol. 30. He was chaplain to Bilſon biſhop of Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to lady Walſingham, widow of the Secretary. A good old portrait of him, in a brown furred gown, is in the college. Aubrey ſays, that his picture was drawn by Mr. Bathurſt, one of the foundation of Trinity college, from memory three years after his death, which was a ſtrong likeneſs. SURREY, tom. v. p. 406. His Life, but with many miſtakes and abſurdities, is among Aubrey's manuſcript LIVES in the Aſhmolean Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum.</p>
                     <p>The following anecdote is recorded of Dr. Kettel, which I relate, becauſe it is imperfectly told by Aubrey, and as it marks the times. While preſident, it was his cuſtom to attend daily the DISPUTATIONS in the college-hall, on which occaſion he conſtantly wore a large black-furred muff. Before him ſtood an hour-glaſs, brought by himſelf into the hall, and placed on a table, for aſcertaining the time of the continuance of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, which was to laſt an hour at leaſt. One morning, after Cromwell's ſoldiers had taken poſſeſſion of Oxford, a halberdier ruſhed into the hall during this ceremony, and plucking off our venerable doctor's muff, threw it in his face; and then with a ſtroke of his halberd broke the hour-glaſs in pieces. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, though old and infirm, inſtantly ſeized the ſoldier by the collar, who was ſoon overpowered by the aſſiſtance of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants. The halberd was carried out of the hall in triumph before the doctor; but the priſoner, with his halberd, was quickly reſcued by a party of ſoldiers, who ſtood at the bottom of the hall, and had enjoyed the whole tranſaction. <hi>MS.
