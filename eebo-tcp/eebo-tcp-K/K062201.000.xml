            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Letters are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd at the Solicitation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, who are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they will anſwer ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good Ends, as they may not only direct the <hi>Forms</hi> requiſite to be obſerved on the moſt important Occaſions; but, what is more to the Purpoſe, by the Rules and Inſtructions contained in them, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>mend the Heart,</hi> and <hi>improve the Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NATURE, PROPRIETY of CHARACTER, PLAIN SENSE, and GENERAL USE, have been the chief Objects of the Author's Attention in the penning of theſe Letters; and as he every-where aimed to write to the <hi>Judgment,</hi> rather than to the <hi>Imagination,</hi> he would chuſe, that they ſhould generally be found more <hi>uſeful</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0866800400:3"/>
than <hi>diverting:</hi> Tho', where the Subjects require <hi>Strokes of Humour,</hi> and <hi>innocent Raillery,</hi> it will be ſeen, perhaps, that the Method he has taken, was the Effect of <hi>Choice,</hi> and not merely of <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Writer is no Friend to long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces; but it may be neceſſary, however, to ſay, what he has <hi>aimed at</hi> in this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and to leave his <hi>Merit</hi> in the <hi>Execution</hi> of it, to proper Judges.</p>
            <p>He has endeavour'd then, in general, throughout the great Variety of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to inculcate the Principles of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Benevolence;</hi> to deſcribe <hi>properly,</hi> and recommend <hi>ſtrongly,</hi> the SOCIAL and RELATIVE DUTIES; and to place them in ſuch <hi>practical</hi> Lights, that the Letters may ſerve for Rules to THINK and ACT by, as well as Forms to WRITE after.</p>
            <p>Particularly, he has endeavoured to point out the Duty of a <hi>Servant,</hi> not a <hi>Slave;</hi> the Duty of a <hi>Maſter,</hi> not a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;</hi> that of the <hi>Parent,</hi> not as a Perſon moroſe and ſour, and hard to be pleaſed; but mild, indulgent, kind, and ſuch an one as would rather govern by <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> than <hi>Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0866800400:4"/>
He has endeavour'd to direct the young Man in the Choice of his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Companions;</hi> to excite him to <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi> to diſcourage <hi>Extravagance, Sottiſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> of all Kinds.</p>
            <p>He has aimed to ſet forth, in a Variety of Caſes, to <hi>both Sexes,</hi> the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies attending <hi>unſuitable Marriages;</hi> to expoſe the Folly of a <hi>litigious Spirit;</hi> to conſole the <hi>Unhappy;</hi> to comfort the <hi>Mourner:</hi> And many of theſe by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho' <hi>eaſy</hi> and <hi>familiar,</hi> yet <hi>new</hi> and <hi>uncommon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the Letters of <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> the Author has aimed to point out ſuch Methods of Addreſs, to a young Man, as may ſtand the Teſt of the <hi>Parents Judgment,</hi> as well as the <hi>Daughter's Opinion;</hi> and, at the ſame time, that they ſhould not want the proper Warmth of Expreſſion, which Complaiſance, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the beloved Object, inſpire, (and is ſo much expected in Addreſſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) they ſhould have their Foundation laid in <hi>common Senſe,</hi> and a <hi>manly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;</hi> and, in a Word, be ſuch as a <hi>prudent Woman</hi> need not bluſh to receive, nor a <hi>diſcreet Man</hi> be aſhamed to look
<pb facs="tcp:0866800400:5"/>
back upon, when the <hi>doubtful Courtſhip</hi> is changed into the <hi>matrimonial Certainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this View he has alſo attempted to expoſe the <hi>empty Flou iſhes,</hi> and <hi>inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Rhapſodies,</hi> by which <hi>ſhallow Heads,</hi> and <hi>deſigning Hearts,</hi> endeavour to exalt their Miſtreſſes into <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> in hopes of having it in their Power to ſink them into the Characters of the <hi>moſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh</hi> of their Sex.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orphans,</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>independent Fortunes,</hi> he has particularly endeavour'd to guard againſt the inſidious Arts of their <hi>flattering</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Dependents, and the <hi>clandeſtine</hi> Addreſſes of <hi>Fortune-hunters,</hi> thoſe Beaſts of Prey, as they may well be called, who ſpread their <hi>Snares</hi> for the <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>thoughtleſs</hi> Heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe, among other no leſs material Objects, have been the Author's principal <hi>Aim:</hi> How well he has <hi>ſucceeded,</hi> muſt, as has been hinted, be left to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the candid Reader.</p>

And as he is not your eldeſt Son, I ſhould, were it to me, put him to a Merchant; or, as we live in an Iſland, and Trade and Navigation are both our Riches and our Glory, I ſhould not even ſcruple to put a <hi>ſecond</hi> Son to a creditable wholeſale Dealer, rather than fail; if he himſelf is not averſe to ſuch a Calling. For I know not (you'll excuſe me, I'm ſure) whether <hi>Will</hi>'s Genius is equal to that of an univerſal Merchant: For, the various Springs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, the Seaſons for chuſing proper Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and numberleſs Incidents that make a neceſſary Return of Gain precarious, are full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the ſtrongeſt Judgment; as a Man, by one ill-choſen Venture, often loſes more than he gains by ſeveral ſucceſsful ones.</p>
                  <p>But this Opinion of <hi>Will,</hi> ſhould you think it juſt, will be no Obſtacle to his ſucceeding in the World in ſome creditable eaſy Buſineſs. Tho' I think him unequal to the Part you ſeem inclinable to allot him; yet he is no Fool: And Experience teaches us, that, in ſome ſorts of Buſineſs, ample Advantage, may be made by very moderate Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, with much Reputation. Theſe are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſuch Employments as merely conſiſt in Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng with Prudence, and in Selling at a Market-profit:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0866800400:18"/>
Hence we ſee ſeveral Wholeſale Dealers gain large Fortunes with Eaſe and Credit, and without any other Secret than the plain Practice of Buying at the beſt Hand, paying for their Goods punctually, and vending them always <hi>for what they are.</hi> In Dealings of this Kind, the Fatigues are few, and clear well-kept Books are ſufficient to ſhew, at any time, a Man's Loſs or Gain; for which, generally ſpeaking, leſs than One Forenoon in a Week is ſufficient: And yet, by a conſtant Attention, in this eaſy manner, as <hi>good</hi> a Character, and, very often, <hi>more</hi> Money is to be gained than in Profeſſions that require an extraordinary Genius, a perpetual Attention, and a cloſe and intenſe Study; which very ſeldom ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds neither: For ſee you not of Hundreds of Lawyers, how very few of them make a Figure, or get genteel Bread? And how many, for want of Courage to appear at the Bar (who yet have good Parts and Knowledge in the Laws) are forced to confine themſelves to Chamber-practice, in which it is a long time before they grow noted enough to make a tolerable Livelihood.</p>
                  <p>As to what you hint, of placing him in the Phyſick Tribe; I like this no better than the other. Conſider only this one Thing, how long it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will be capable of entering into Buſineſs, or Reputation, as a Phyſician, if he ever does it at all: For who chuſes to truſt his Health to a raw and unexperienced young Man? The Law requires a ſprightly Impudence, if I may ſo ſay, the Phyſick Line a ſolemn one, in the Perſon who would make a Figure in either. And do you think, tho' <hi>Will</hi> is grave enough of Conſcience, that he ever can come up to that important Deportment, that unbluſhing Parade, which is the very Eſſence of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſician? So he may, in either of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0866800400:19"/>
live over all his Days, and be quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; for, as <hi>Practice</hi> in both Faculties is the beſt Teacher, and <hi>Theory</hi> a moſt uncertain Guide, he may live to be Forty of Fifty Years of Age, and not come into any Buſineſs that ſhall improve himſelf, or benefit his Conſulters.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in the Way I propoſe, no ſooner is he come of Age, and fit to be truſted with the Management of any Affairs at all, but his Seven Years will be expired; and if he has not been wanting to himſelf in it (and if he be, he would have been much more ſo in an abſtruſer Buſineſs) he will be enabled, with the Fortune you can beſtow upon him, to enter upon the Stage of the World with great Advantage, and become <hi>directly,</hi> a neceſſary and an uſeful Member of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And, my good Friend, when you and I recollect, that moſt of the noble Families in the Kingdom, as well as the genteel ones, had the Foundations of their Grandeur laid in Trade, I expect not, in ſuch a Country as ours eſpecially, that any Objection to my Advice will be form'd, either by you or your good Lady, on this Score, if you have not more ſignificant Reaſons proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Boy's Turn of Mind and Inclination; which, I think, ſhould always be conſulted on theſe Occaſions. For, tho' I hope it never will be ſo in your Caſe, yet nothing has been more common, than that of Two Sons, the Eldeſt brought up to the Eſtate, the other to Trade, in the Revolution of Twenty or Thirty Years, the latter, thro' the Extravagance of the former, has made himſelf <hi>Eldeſt,</hi> as I may ſay; for, by ſaving while the other has been ſpending, he has found Means to keep the Eſtate in the Family, tho' it has been transferr'd upon the <hi>youngeſt,</hi> and, as it has then proved, the <hi>worthieſt</hi> Branch.</p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0866800400:20"/>
This, I think, deſerves your Conſideration; and by viewing <hi>Will</hi> in the ſame Light I do; that of a well-inclined Lad, of moderate Paſſions, great natural Modeſty, and no ſoaring Genius; I believe you will think it beſt to diſpoſe of him in ſuch manner as may require no greater Talents than he is poſſeſſed of, and may, in due Time, make him appear in the Face of the World fully quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for what he undertakes.

                     <salute>Dear Nephew,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM very much concerned to hear that you are of late fallen into bad Company; that you keep bad Hours, and give great Uneaſineſs to your Maſter, and break the Rules of his Family: That when he expoſtulates with you on this Occaſion, you return pert and bold Anſwers; and, inſtead of promiſing or endeavouring to amend, repeat the Offence; and have enter'd into Clubs and Societies of young Fellows, who ſet at naught all good Example, and make ſuch Perſons who would do their Duty, the Subject of their Ridicule, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of narrow Minds, and who want the Courage to do as they do.</p>
                  <p>Let me, on this Occaſion, expoſtulate with you, and ſet before you the Evil of the Way you are in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0866800400:21"/>
In the firſt Place: What can you mean by breaking the Rules of a Family you had bound your ſelf by Contract to obſerve? Do you think it is <hi>honeſt,</hi> to break thro' Engagements into which you have ſo ſolemnly entered; and which are no leſs the Rules of the Corporation you are to be one Day free of, than thoſe of a private Family?—Seven Years, ſeveral of which are elapſed, are not ſo long a Term, but that you may ſee it determined before you are over-fit to betruſted with your own Conduct: Twenty-one or Twenty-two Years of Age, is full early for a young Man to be his own Maſter, whatever you may think; and you may ſurely ſtay till <hi>then,</hi> at leaſt, to chuſe your own Hours, and your own Company; and, I fear, as you go on, if you do not mend your Ways, your Diſcretion will not <hi>then</hi> do Credit to your Choice. Remember, you have no Time you can call your own, during the Continuance of your Contract; and muſt you abuſe your Maſter in a double Senſe; rob him of his Time, eſpecially if any of it be Hours of Buſineſs; rob him of his Reſt; break the Peace of his Family, and give a bad Example to others? And all for what? Why to riot in the Company of a Set of Perſons, who contemn, as they teach you to do, all Order and Diſcipline; who, in all Likelihood, will lead you into into Gaming, Drinking, Swearing, and even more dangerous Vices, to the unhinging of your Mind from your Buſineſs, which muſt be your future Support.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, I exhort you, in time, to what theſe Courſes may lead you. Conſider the Affiction you will give to all your Friends, by your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in them. Lay together the Subſtance of the Converſation that paſſes in a whole Evening, with your frothy Companions, after you are come
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0866800400:22"/>
from them, and reflect what ſolid Truth, what uſeful Leſſon, worthy of being inculcated in your future Life, that whole Evening has afforded you; and conſider, whether it is worth breaking thro' all Rule and Order for?—Whether your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conduct is ſuch as you would allow in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of your own? Whether you are ſo capable to purſue your Buſineſs with that Ardor and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light next Morning, as if you had not drank, or kept bad Hours over Night? If not, whether your Maſter has not a double Loſs and Damage from your miſ-ſpent Evenings? Whether the taking of ſmall Liberties, as you may think them, leads you not on to greater; for, let me tell you, you will not find it in your Power to ſtop when you will: And then, whether any Reſtraint at all will not in time be irkſome to you?</p>
                  <p>I have gone thro' the like Servitude with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Credit. I found myſelf my own Maſter full ſoon for my Diſcretion: What you think of your ſelf I know not; but I wiſh you may do as well for your own Intereſt, and Reputation too, as I have done for mine: And I'll aſſure you, I ſhould not have thought it either creditable or <hi>honeſt</hi> to do as you do. I could have ſtood the Laugh of an Hundred ſuch vain Companions as you chuſe, for being too narrow-minded to break thro' all moral Obligations to my Maſter, in order to ſhew the Bravery of a bad Heart, and what an abandon'd Mind dared to perpetrate. A bad Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſeldom makes a good Ending, and if you was aſſured that you could ſtop when you came for your ſelf, which is very improbable, how will you anſwer it to Equity and good Conſcience, that you will not do ſo for your Maſter? There is, let me tell you, more true Bravery of Mind in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to do an Injury, than in giving Offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0866800400:23"/>
You are now at an Age, when you ſhould ſtudy to <hi>improve</hi> not <hi>divert</hi> your Faculties. You ſhould now lay in a Fund of Knowledge, that in time, when ripened by Experience, may make you a worthy Member of the Commonwealth. Do you think you have nothing to learn, either as to your Buſineſs, or as to the forming of your Mind? Would it not be much better to chuſe the ſilent, the ſober Converſation of BOOKS, than of ſuch Companions as never read or think? An Author never commits any but his beſt Thoughts to Paper; but what can you expect from the laughing noiſy Company you keep, but frothy Prate, indigeſted Notions, and Thoughts ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being remember'd, that it is the greateſt Kindneſs to forget them.</p>
                  <p>Let me intreat you then, my dear Kinſman, for your Family's ſake, for your own ſake, before it be too late, to reflect as you ought upon the Courſe you are enter'd into. By applying yourſelf to Books, inſtead of ſuch vain Company, you will be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in time for the beſt of Company, and to be reſpected by all Ranks of Men. This will keep you out of unneceſſary Expences, will employ all your leiſure Time, will exclude a world of Temptations, and open and inlarge your Notions of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n and Things, and, finally, ſet you above that wretched Company which now you ſeem ſo much delighted with. And one Thing let me recommend to you, That you keep a Liſt of the young Men of your Standing within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of your Knowledge, and for the next Seven Years obſerve what Fate will attend them: See, if thoſe who follow <hi>not</hi> the Courſe you are ſo lately enter'd into, will not appear in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Light from thoſe who <hi>do;</hi> and from the Induſtry and Proſperity of the one, and the

Decay or Failure of the other, (if their vain Ways do not blaſt them before, or as ſoon as they begin the World) you'll find abundant Reaſon every Day to juſtify the Truth of the Obſervations I have thrown together. As nothing but my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for you could poſſibly influence me to theſe Expoſtulations, I hope for a proper Effect from them, if you would be thought well of by, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Favour from,</p>

                  <p>I AM very ſorry to hear of the Difference between your Maſter and you. I was always afraid you would expect the ſame Indulgences you had met with at home; and as you know, that in many Inſtances, I have endeavoured to make any ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hardſhip as eaſy to you as I could, if this cauſes you to be harder to be ſatisfied, it would be a great Trouble to me. Your Uncle tells me, I am afraid with too much Truth, that the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences you have received from me, have made your preſent Station more diſagreeable than it would otherwiſe have been. What I have always done for you was intended for your Good, and nothing could ſo deeply afflict me as to ſee my Tenderneſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0866800400:25"/>
have a contrary Effect: Therefore, dear Child, to my conſtant Care for your Welfare, do not add the Sorrow of ſeeing it the Cauſe of your behaving worſe than if it had not been beſtow'd upon you; for as, before we put you to your Maſter, we had an extraordinary Character of him, from all his Neighbours, and thoſe who dealt with him; and as Mr. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who is now out of his Time, gives him the beſt of Characters, and declares your Miſtreſs to be a Woman of great Prudence and good Conduct; I know not how to think they would uſe you ill in any reſpect. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, my Dear, you muſt not, in any Woman beſide myſelf, expect to find a fond, and perhaps partial Mother; for, the little Failings which I could not ſee in you, will appear very plain to other Perſons. My Love for you would make me wiſh you always with me; but as that is what your future Welfare will no way permit; and as you muſt certainly be a Gainer by the Situation you are now in, let a Deſire to promote <hi>my</hi> Happineſs, as well as <hi>your own,</hi> make every ſeeming Difficulty light; which, I hope, will appear much lighter for being what I intreat you to diſpenſe with; who am,</p>

It is ſo much a Maſter's Intereſt to uſe his Apprentices well, that I am inclinable to think that when they are badly treated, it is oftener the Effect of Provocation than Choice. Wherefore, before I give myſelf the Trouble of interpoſing in your Behalf, I deſire you will ſtrictly inquire of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether you have not, by ſome Miſconduct or other, provoked that Alteration in your Maſter's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of which you ſo much complain.

                  <p>Old Age is generally ſlow and heavy, Youth headſtrong and precipitate; but there are old Men who are full of Vivacity, and young Men reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Diſcretion; which makes me rather point out the <hi>Conduct</hi> than the <hi>Age</hi> of the Perſons with whom you ſhould chuſe to aſſociate; tho' after all, it is a never-failing good Sign to me of Prudence and Virtue in a young Man, when his Seniors chuſe his Company, and he delights in theirs.</p>
                  <p>Let your Endeavour therefore be, at all Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to conſort yourſelf with Men of Sobriety, good Senſe and Virtue; for the Proverb is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring one, that ſays, <hi>A Man is known by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he keeps.</hi> If ſuch Men you can ſingle out, while you improve by their Converſation, you will benefit by their Advice; and be ſure remember one thing, that tho' you muſt be frank and unreſerved in delivering your Sentiments, when Occaſions offer, yet that you be much readier to <hi>hear</hi> than <hi>ſpeak;</hi> for to this Purpoſe it has been ſignificantly obſerved, that Nature has given a Man <hi>two</hi> Ears,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0866800400:30"/>
and but <hi>one</hi> Tongue. Lay in therefore by Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and a modeſt Silence, ſuch a Store of Ideas, that you may at their Time of Life, make no worſe Figure than they do; and endeavour to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit yourſelf rather by other Peoples Ills than your own. How muſt thoſe young Men expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Contempt and Ridicule of their Seniors, who having ſeen little or nothing of the World, are continually ſhutting out by <hi>open Mouths</hi> and <hi>cloſed Ears,</hi> all Poſſibility of Inſtruction, and making vain the principal End of Converſation, which is Improvement. A ſilent young Man makes generally a wiſe old one, and never fails of being reſpected by the beſt and moſt prudent Men. When therefore you come among Strangers, hear every one ſpeak before you deliver your own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; by this means you will judge of the Merit and Capacities of your Company, and avoid expoſing yourſelf, as I have known many do, by ſhooting out haſty and inconſiderate Bolts, which they would have been glad to recal, when perhaps a ſilent Genius in Company has burſt out upon them with ſuch Obſervations, as have ſtruck Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs and Shame in the forward Speaker, if he has not been quite inſenſible of inward Reproach.</p>
                  <p>I have thrown together, as they occurr'd, a few Thoughts, which may ſuffice for the preſent to ſhew my Care and Concern for your Welfare. I hope you will conſtantly from time to time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me whatever you ſhall think worthy of my Notice, or in which my Advice may be of Uſe to you. For I have no Pleaſure in this Life equal to that which the Happineſs of my Children gives me. And of this you may be aſſured; for I am, and ever muſt be,</p>

                  <head>LETTER VIII. General Rules for agreeable Converſation in a young Man. From a Father to a Son.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear <hi>William,</hi>
                     </salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AS I had not an Opportunity of ſaying ſo much to you as I wiſhed when you were laſt here; I ſend this to inform you of ſome things in your general Converſation, which I think would be proper for you to obſerve, and amend; particularly <hi>your exceſſive Itch for Talking,</hi> which diſcovers itſelf alike on all Occaſions. I have always flatter'd my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that you do not want Senſe, and am willing to hope I have not been deceived: But the dangerous Self-ſufficiency of moſt young Men, ſeems violently to have ſeized you, which, I hope, a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection will remove.</p>
                  <p>The Art of rendering yourſelf agreeable in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is worth your ſerious Study: 'Tis an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage few can boaſt, tho' ſought after by all; and nothing is ſo conſtant an Enemy to Succeſs in thoſe who would excel in this Art, as the harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Opinion of their own Proficiency, before they have attained to any tolerable Degree of Knowledge in what they imagine themſelves poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of. Converſation, where it is rightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, muſt be ſo conducted, as to let each Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Company have a Share in the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Applauſe</hi> it affords: If you are Six in Number, after you have told a Story, or made any Remark which gives a general Satisfaction; you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it the Right of another to call <hi>your</hi> Attention in his Turn; and, unleſs particularly requeſted, it betrays a great Weakneſs to <hi>follow yourſelf.</hi> No doubt but you love to be admired: And have not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0866800400:32"/>
others the ſame Paſſion? You believe your Wit more brilliant than theirs? Are you ſure that they are not of the ſame Opinion as to their own? If a Man ſpeaks little, you muſt not from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him willing to give up every Claim to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible Merit: Perhaps he cannot ſing: But to be ſure he is as deſirous of having his <hi>peculiar Humour,</hi> or his <hi>dry Joke</hi> applauded, as you are to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Song. If he is no Mathematician, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he is verſed in religious Diſputation; if he deſpiſes Plays, he may admire Hiſtory; tho' he underſtands not Geography, he may yet know how to deſcribe the Humours of Mankind: And tho' he pretends not to Politicks, he may have a Turn for ſome more uſeful Science. When theſe are conſidered, if his Modeſty is great, you cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him more than by throwing an Opportunity in his way to diſplay his Capacity on the Subject he believes himſelf moſt able to handle with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: For, in order to ſupport a thorough good Humour, a Man muſt be pleaſed with <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> as well as with <hi>others.</hi> When this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken Care of, Converſation ſeldom fails to prove entertaining: And to the Neglect of this, are owing many of the <hi>yawning</hi> Hours ſpent in Companies compoſed of Men not incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having agreeably.</p>
                  <p>The Manner of telling a Story, is alſo worth your Notice: You have known the Pleaſure of hearing a long one well told: Mr. <hi>Trotter</hi> has an admirable Talent in this way: But then you muſt obſerve, that half the Pleaſure he gives, ariſes from his happily avoiding any of the ſilly Digreſſions, which are the great Cauſe of a Story's ſeeming tedious: You never hear him mingle his Relation with, <hi>I remember very well it was the ſame Day that 'Squire</hi> Trumbul's <hi>Son came of Age.—I bought</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0866800400:33"/>
                     <hi>my bay Nag the very Day before, at ſuch a Fair, being a</hi> Friday <hi>that Year;—or, I can ſcarce think of it without Laughing;—But, however, as I was ſaying:</hi>—And a hundred more ſuch Dead-weights to Attention. Nor does he ever praiſe a Story be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he relates it; a fatal Rock to many a good Relation: For when any Story wants a preparatory Recommendation, it ought not to be told; and even when the Relation is poſſible, the Generality of Auditors are apt to perſuade themſelves,<q>
                        <hi>The Mountain labours, and a Mouſe is born.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are looſe and general Hints; but by a due Improvement of them, you will find yourſelf very ſenſibly grow more and more agreeable where-ever you converſe. An Eaſe and becoming Freedom you already have, and by the Addition of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your Uſe of them, and Complaiſance to others, you will probably ſucceed in the Deſire ſo predominant in you, of being admired by Men of Senſe and Judgment.

                     <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM more concerned for your Welfare than you imagine. You are younger than myſelf: My Duty, in ſome Degree, requires my Care for your Good, and particularly in a Point that may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0866800400:34"/>
be ſo material to your whole Life, as is that of Love.</p>
                  <p>Beauty has as great a Force upon my Senſes, as it can have upon yours. I am near Thirty Years of Age; you are not more than Twenty. Your Paſſions are ſtrong; mine, Brother, are far from ſubſiding: I admire, I love, with as much Force of Nature as you can do. My Reaſon ought to be ſtronger, and 'tis well if my Paſſion is not ſo likewiſe. Miſs <hi>Rooke</hi> is amiable on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; her Features are regular, her Wit ſprightly, her Deportment genteel; and Voice,—I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, raviſhing. Her Dreſs is eaſy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected; and her Manner of Converſation, has a Freedom that captivates more Hearts, than yours: Yet, I greatly fear, with all theſe Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe will not make the Wife you ought to wiſh for. Her airy Flights, and gay Behaviour, are pleaſing, as a Partner in Converſation, but will they be equally agreeable in a Partner <hi>for Life?</hi> What now charms <hi>you,</hi> charms alſo <hi>others:</hi> You are now content with thinking yourſelf <hi>one</hi> among <hi>many</hi> that admire her, and are admitted to <hi>ſhare</hi> the Brilliancy of her Converſation; but will a <hi>Share</hi> of her Wit and Humour, her Freedom and Gaiety, pleaſe hereafter as a Wife? And tho' ſhe is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Company, are you ſatisfied ſhe will be as agreeable when alone with you; or when ſhe has not an Opportunity of ſhewing-away in a Company that perhaps you may not approve? She now ſees nobody but whom ſhe chuſes to ſee: If ſhe ſhould be a Wife, it is more than probable ſhe may diſlike Reſtraints: and can you approve of a diffuſe Converſation in one you deſire to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
                  <p>Think not, Brother, that I have any intereſted Motive for this Advice. I aſſure you I have not.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0866800400:35"/>
I am not your Rival: I deſire not the Lady you ſeem too fond of. All I mean (for I ſay nothing at preſent, with regard to your own Youth, which ought not, however, to be wholly forgotten, as very few prudent Matches are made by young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at your Age) is, to caution you againſt thinking of a Gentlewoman who <hi>may,</hi> and I am willing to believe <hi>will,</hi> be a ſuitable Companion to a Gentleman whoſe Station and Choice leads him into much Company, and gay Life; but to Men whoſe Circumſtances, if not their Inclinations, require a more retired way of Life, it is obvious, a Woman, whoſe Talents lie principally in Converſation, can never, for that Reaſon <hi>only,</hi> juſtify a young Gentleman for chuſing her for a Wife.</p>
                  <p>I hope this will come time enough to put you upon guarding againſt the Inconveniencies that threaten the Indulgence of your preſent Paſſion. Shut not your Ears to Reaſon; forget not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and be ſure to remember, that the Pleaſure of an <hi>Hour or Two,</hi> and of Twenty, Thirty, or Forty Years, or a <hi>whole Life,</hi> muſt ariſe from very different Sources.

                  <p>YOU may be certain that your Misfortunes are to me a moſt melancholy Subject: You are my only Brother: I own it: And your Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0866800400:36"/>
affect me next to my own: But there is this Difference in what I feel for you, and for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: I am ſure, every Misfortune I have met with, has been occaſioned by unavoidable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. This Conſideration has ſupported me under the many Afflictions I have myſelf endured: But for thoſe I have ſhared with you, I cannot boaſt the ſame Alleviation. While our Father lived, he was your conſtant and unwearied Support, even after your Patrimony was ſquander'd away. While our Mother remained, ſhe was every Week aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Neceſſities, but what might more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called your Levity and Extravagance. She is now, by the Divine Will, taken from us both; her Jointure, as well as the Eſtate my Father independently left, has devolved upon me. Of this both Nature and Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire I ſhould make the beſt Uſe: And to ſerve you, I readily confeſs, is my greateſt Care. But, my dear Brother, how is this to be done? The generous and bountiful Aſſiſtance of our Parents, procured you no ſubſtantial Good. What then am I to do to ſcreen you from Want and Miſery?—That you are not already happy, is not owing to the Backwardneſs of your Friends to ſerve you; but, allow me to ſpeak plainly, to your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion. Your own Fortune maintained you not for three Years: Were I able to give you as much more, what Reaſon have you given me to ſuppoſe you will be a better Oeconomiſt than you have been? My whole Eſtate, let me tell you, Brother, at your Rate of Expence, would ſcarcely maintain you for Seven Years: And, think you as you will, I muſt believe it my Duty to leave enough to ſupport my Off-ſpring, with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct, to the End of Time. If I ſend you, as you deſire, Fifty Guineas, What good will

that Sum procure you? It will but ſerve to lengthen your Credit, and make you run deeper into Debt. I have aſſiſted you before; and has not this always been the Caſe?

                  <head>LETTER XI. To a young Man too ſoon keeping a Horſe.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear <hi>Tom,</hi>
                     </salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Always take great Pleaſure in hearing of your Welfare, and of every thing that makes for your Satisfaction and Comfort: But give me Leave to ſay, That I am ſorry to hear you have ſo early begun to keep a Horſe, eſpecially as your Buſineſs is altogether in your Shop, and you have no End to ſerve in riding out; and are, beſides, young and healthy,, and ſo cannot require it, as Exerciſe. And is it worth while, think you, to keep a Horſe the whole Week, that you may have him at hand on a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, if the Day proves fair, and you have nothing to keep you in Town?</p>
                  <p>You muſt conſider, that tho' here, in the Country, many common Tradeſmen keep Horſes, the Expence is but ſmall to them, and the Diſtance of one Cuſtomer from another, in a manner obliges them to it. But this can be no Plea for you: And if you do not want a Horſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0866800400:38"/>
for Exerciſe, you can only alledge the worſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World for your maintaining one; that your Neighbours all round you do the ſame: For, look who they are, and what their Motives, and you'll ſoon ſee the Difference, and that their Example will not juſtify you. Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> for Inſtance, who lives next Door to you, is near Sixty Years of Age, of a pretty groſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and capable of no other Exerciſe; and moreover he had acquired, by Length of Time, and Induſtry, an ample Fortune, before he gave himſelf this Diverſion. Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> has an Eſtate fallen to him, that ſets him above the Want of Trade; and his continuing in it, is rather an Amuſement than an Employment. Mr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Trozier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kent,</hi> are all Men of eſtabliſhed Fortunes; and when you are as old as the <hi>youngeſt</hi> of them, and can as well afford it, I would be far from diſſuading you from keeping a Horſe. But at preſent, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, you rather incur their Contempt, than gain their Eſteem, by offering to appear their Equal, when they and you well know, in what relates to Expences, you ought not to be ſo, nor have you had a Time for it. The lower Part of the World may, perhaps, ſhew you more Reſpect for thoſe Marks of Subſtance; but ſhould a Time come (and who is exempt from Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes?) when they muſt know they were the Effects of unthinking Levity; how deſpicable muſt you then appear in their Eyes? And, let me tell you, that the Eſteem of Perſons of Credit and Underſtanding, muſt be gained by very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Means, from Shew or Equipage; for with theſe, Modeſty, Prudence, and good Senſe only, will ever prevail.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0866800400:39"/>
Beſides, the Expence of the Horſe is not the leaſt thing to be conſidered: It will in time, very probably, lead you into a more dangerous one, that of beſtowing too much of your Time in the Uſe of it. It will unhinge your Mind, as I may ſay, from Buſineſs, and give your Servants Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be remiſs in your Abſence. And as you are a young Man, it is fit that you ſhould lay up, by your Induſtry, againſt a more advanced Age, when the Exerciſe a Horſe affords, will ſeem not only more ſuitable, but perhaps abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to your Health; whereas now, it may rather paſs for Wantonneſs and Affectation.</p>
                  <p>You are not without a tolerable Share of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; let me prevail with you to uſe it: Sell your Horſe, and fear not being laugh'd at on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for it will be a Credit to you more Ways than one, to ſay, That your Buſineſs would not allow you Time to uſe it. And it would argue beſides, great Perverſeneſs, to continue in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for no other Reaſon than to ſupport a wrong Judgment at firſt ſetting out: And your reducing an unneceſſary Expence in good time, will more than recover any good Opinion you may have loſt by running into it.</p>
                  <p>Your prudent Uſe of this Advice, will, as it muſt tend to your Good, be a great Satisfaction to</p>

But, generally ſpeaking, an Openneſs to a Stranger carries with it ſtrong Marks of Indiſcretion, and not ſeldom ends in Repentance.</p>

Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> has Vivacity and Humour enough to pleaſe any Man of a light Turn; but where I to give my Judgment of him, I ſhould pronounce him fitter for the Tea-table, than the Cabinet. He is ſmart, but very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; and treats all ſerious Subjects with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt too natural to bad Minds; and I know more young Men than one, of whoſe good Opinion he has taken Advantage, and has made them wiſer, though at their own Expence, than he found them.</p>
                  <p>The Caution I here give you, is the pure Effect of my Experience in Life, ſome Knowledge of your new Aſſociate, and my Affection for you. The Uſe you make of it will determine, whether you merit this Concern from</p>

My Couſin has brought him once or twice into my Company, which he could not well decline doing, becauſe he has Dealings with him; and has an high Opinion of him, and his Circumſtances. He has been ſet up Three Years, and has very good Buſineſs, and lives in Credit and Faſhion. He is about Twenty-ſeven Years old, and a likely Man enough: He ſeems not to want Senſe or Manners; and is come of a good Family. He has broke his Mind to me, and boaſts how well he can maintain me: But, I aſſure you, Sir, I have given him no Encouragement; and told him, that I had no Thoughts of changing my Condition, yet a while; and ſhould never think of it but in Obedience to my Parents; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to talk no more on that Subject to me. Yet he reſolves to perſevere, and pretends extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Affection and Eſteem. I would not, Sir, by any means, omit to acquaint you with the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings</hi> of an Affair, that would be want of Duty in me to conceal from you, and ſhew a Guilt and Diſobedience unworthy of the kind Indulgence and Affection you have always ſhewn to, Sir,</p>

If what I have already opened to him as to my Circumſtances, be not unacceptable, I ſhould humbly hope for Leave to pay you and him a Viſit at <hi>Nottingham;</hi> or if this be too great a Favour, till he has made further Enquiry, that he would be pleaſed to give himſelf that Trouble, and put it in my Power, as ſoon as poſſible, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the Truth of my Allegations, upon which I deſire to ſtand or fall in my Hopes of your Favour and his. For I think, far different from many in the World, that a Deception in an Affair of this weighty Nature, ſhould be leſs forgiven than in any other. Since then, deareſt Madam, I build

                  <head>LETTER XXXVI. A Father to a Son, to diſſuade him from the Vice of Drinking to Exceſs.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My dear Son,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is with a Grief proportioned to my Love, which is extreme, that I underſtand you have of late neglected your Studies, and given yourſelf up to the odious Vice of Drinking: What ſhall I ſay, what ſhall I do, to engage you to quit this pernicious Practice, before it becomes ſuch a Habit, that it will be impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult, for you to caſt it off? Let me require, let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, to give a ſuitable Attention to what I have to ſay on this Head, which I ſhall offer rather as a warm Friend, than an angry Father; and as I addreſs myſelf to your Reaſon, I will leave it to yourſelf to judge of the Truth of the Obſervations I have to make to you.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, with reſpect to <hi>Health,</hi> the greateſt Jewel of this Life, it is the moſt deſtructive of all Vices: <hi>Aſthma's, Vertigoes, Palſies, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies,</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0866800400:61"/>
                     <hi>Gouts, Colicks, Fevers, Dropſies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, Stone,</hi> and <hi>Hypochondriack Diſeaſes,</hi> are naturally introduced by exceſſive Drinking.</p>
                  <p>All the reſt of the Vices together, are not ſo often puniſhed with ſudden Death as this one: What fatal Accidents, what Quarrels, what Breaches between Friend and Friend, are owing to it?</p>
                  <p>Then, in the ſecond Place; How does it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face Reaſon, deſtroy all the tender Impulſes of Nature, make a wiſe Man a Fool, and ſubject Perſons of the brighteſt Parts to the Contempt of the weakeſt, and even, in time, extinguiſh thoſe ſhining Qualities, which conſtitute the Difference between a Man of Senſe and a Blockhead? For, as a certain very eminent Author well obſerves, Fools having generally ſtronger Nerves, and leſs volatile Spirits, than Men of fine Underſtandings, that which will rouſe the one, will make the other either ſtupid or frantick; and tho' it ſometimes, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the Fit continues, ſtrengthens the Imagination, yet it always depreſſes the Judgment; and after the Fit is over, both thoſe Faculties languiſh together, till, in time, it quenches the Imagination, impairs the Memory, and drowns the Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Moſt other Vices are compatible, as the ſame Author obſerves, with ſeveral Virtues; but Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs runs counter to all the Duties of Life. A great Drinker can hardly be either a good Huſband, a good Father, a good Son, a good Brother, or a good Friend: It lays him open to the worſt Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany, and this Company frequently ſubjects him to lewd Women, Gaming, Quarrels, Riots, and often Murders. All other Vices, even the greateſt of Vices, as Ambition, Unchaſtity, Bigotry, Avarice, Hypocriſy, deteſt this unnatural and worſe than beaſtly Vice; for the Beaſts themſelves,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0866800400:62"/>
even the uncleaneſt of them, know nothing of it, much leſs practiſe it.</p>
                  <p>Other Vices indeed make Men <hi>worſe,</hi> ſays this judicious Author; but this <hi>alters</hi> Men from <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> to that degree, that they differ not more from their <hi>preſent Companions,</hi> than from their <hi>former Selves.</hi> A Habitude of it will make the Prudent inconſiderate, the Ambitious indolent, the Active idle, and the Induſtrious ſlothful; ſo that their Affairs are ruin'd for want of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by being intruſted in the Hands of thoſe, who turn them wholly to their own Advantage, and, in the End, to the Ruin of thoſe who employ them.</p>
                  <p>I have written a long Letter already: Yet have I ſtill more to ſay, which, that I may not tire you, I will leave to another Letter; which the next Poſt ſhall bring you. And I am, mean time, in hopes <hi>this</hi> will not loſe its proper Effect,</p>

                  <p>BY my former you will ſee, that hard Drinking is a Vice, that breaks a Man's Reſt, impairs the Underſtanding, extinguiſhes the Memory, inflames the Paſſions, debauches the Will, lays the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worſt and moſt dangerous Diſtempers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitates a Perſon from purſuing his Studies, and from applying to the Duties of his Calling, be it what it will; begets Contempt from the World; and even if a Man's Circumſtances were above feeling the Expence, which can hardly be, alters
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0866800400:63"/>
and changes the Practiſer of it from himſelf; and if he is <hi>not</hi> above feeling it, often reduces him to Want and Beggary: And if he has a Family, his Children, who by their Father's Induſtry and Sobriety might have made a creditable Figure in Life, are left to the Mercy of the World, become the Outcaſts of the Earth; poſſibly Foot-ſoldiers, Livery-ſervants, Shoe-cleaners, Link-boys, and, perhaps, Pickpockets, Highwaymen, or Foot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pads; and inſtead of a comfortable Livelihood, and a Station above Contempt, are intitled only to Shame, Miſery, and the Gallows.</p>
                  <p>And do <hi>you</hi> judge, my Son, how a Man can anſwer this Conduct to God, to his Parents and other Relations, to his Wife, to his Children, to himſelf, and perſiſt in a barbarous and an unnatural Vice, which makes himſelf not only miſerable and contemptible, but tranſmits the Miſchief to his unhappy and innocent Children, if he has any.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this, That it is a Vice a Man cannot eaſily maſter and ſubdue; or which, like ſome others, may be cured by <hi>Age;</hi> but it is a Vice that feeds and nouriſhes itſelf by Practice, and grows upon a Man as he lives longer in the World, till at laſt, if it cuts him not off in the Flower of his Days, his Body expects and requires Liquor: And ſo, tho' a Man, when he enters upon it, may be ſingle, yet if he ever ſhould marry, it may he attended with all the frightful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Conſequences I have mentioned, and ruin beſides an innocent and perhaps prudent Woman, rendering her, without <hi>her own</hi> Fault, the joint unhappy Cauſe of adding to the Number of the miſerable and profligate Children, with which the World too much abounds, and which is owing to nothing ſo much as this deteſtable Sin in the Parents.</p>

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0866800400:64"/>
Conſider all theſe things, my dear Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late, get the better of a Vice, that you will find difficult to ſubdue, when it is grown to a Head, and which will otherwiſe creep upon you every Day more and more, till it ſhuts up your Life in Miſery as to yourſelf, and Contempt as to the World; and inſtead of giving Cauſe even to your neareſt and beſt Friends to remember you with Pleaſure, will make it a Kindneſs in them to forget they ever had in the World, if a <hi>Parent,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Son;</hi> if a <hi>Tutor,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Pupil;</hi> if a <hi>Brother</hi> or <hi>Siſter,</hi> ſuch an unhappy <hi>near Relation;</hi> if a <hi>Wife,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Huſband;</hi> if a <hi>Child,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Father;</hi> and if a <hi>Friend,</hi> ſuch a <hi>wretched one,</hi> that cannot be thought of without Pity and Regret, for having ſhortened his Days, and ruin'd his Affairs, by ſo pernicious a Habit.</p>
                  <p>What a Joy, on the contrary, will that nobleſt of Conqueſts, over <hi>yourſelf,</hi> yield to all thoſe dear Relations! And, in particular, what Pleaſure will you give to the aged Heart, and declining Days, of, my dear Child,</p>

There is ſuch good Order in the Family, as well on my Miſtreſs's Part as my Maſter's, that every Servant, as well as I, knows their Duty, and does it with Pleaſure. So much Evenneſs, Sedateneſs, and Regularity, is obſerved in all they injoin and expect, that it is impoſſible but it ſhould be ſo. My Maſter is an honeſt worthy Man; every body ſpeaks well of him. My Miſtreſs is a chearful ſweet-temper'd Woman, and rather heals Breaches than widens them. And the Children, after ſuch Examples, behave to us all, like one's own Brothers and Siſters. Who can but love ſuch a Family?

For tho' I hope he will never ſuffer on the Account of any wilful Remiſſneſs or Negligence, much leſs want of Fidelity, in me, yet his Affairs do not go on ſo well as if he was more in them, and leſs at the Tavern. But it becomes not me to reflect upon my Maſter, eſpecially as what I may write or ſay on this Head, will rather expoſe his Failings, than do him Service; for as it muſt be his Equals that ſhould reprove him, ſo all a Servant can obſerve to others will do more Harm than Good to him. One Thing is at <hi>preſent</hi> in my own Power; and that is, to double my Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that his Family ſuffer as little as poſſible by his Remiſſneſs: And another, I hope, by God's Grace, <hi>will</hi> be; and that is, to avoid in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when my Time comes, thoſe Failings which I ſee ſo blameable in him.

If I could do better, I would; but ſhall be ſtreighten'd to do this: But I think, in Return for your Patience, I cannot do leſs, to convince you, that I am now, at laſt, in Earneſt. I beg you'll continue to me the ſame good Uſage and Service I have met with from you hitherto. And that you'll believe me to be, unfeignedly,</p>

                  <head>LETTER XLVI. To a young Trader generally in a Hurry in Buſineſs, adviſing <hi>Method</hi> as well as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</hi>

                     <salute>Dear Nephew,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Affection I have always borne you, as well for your own ſake, as for your late Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's and Mother's, makes me give you the Trouble of theſe Lines, which I hope you will receive as kindly as I intend them.</p>
                  <p>I have lately call'd upon you ſeveral times, and have as often found you in an extraordinary Hurry; which I well know cannot be ſometimes avoided; but, methinks, need not be always the Caſe, if your Time were diſpoſed in regular and proper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions to your Buſineſs. I have frequently had Reaſon to believe, that more than half the Flutter which appears among Traders in general, is rather the Effect of their <hi>Indolence,</hi> than their <hi>Induſtry;</hi> however willing they are to have it thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and I will give you one Inſtance in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Opinion, in a Neighbour of mine.</p>
                  <p>This Gentleman carried on for ſome Years a profitable Buſineſs; but indulging himſelf every Evening in a Tavern Society or Club, which the Promotion of Buſineſs (as is uſually the Caſe) gave the firſt Pretence for, he looked upon thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements as the natural Conſequence of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Night; and drove on his Buſineſs in the Day with Precipitation, that he might get thither with the earlieſt. He ſeldom kept very late Hours, tho' he never came home ſoon. The Night being gone, and his Bottle empty'd, the Morning was always wanted to diſpel the Fumes of the Wine.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0866800400:72"/>
Whoever therefore came to him before Nine, was deſired to call again; and when he roſe, ſo many Matters waited for him, as directly threw him into a Flutter; ſo that from his Riſing till Dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, he ſeem'd in one continued Forment. A long Dinner-time he always allowed himſelf, in order to recover the Fatigues he had undergone; and all his Table-talk was, How heavy his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lay upon him! And what Pains he took in it! The hearty Meal, and the Time he indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Table, begot an Inappetency for any more Buſineſs for that ſhort Afternoon; ſo all that <hi>could</hi> be deferr'd, was put off to the next Morning; and long'd-for Evening approaching, he flies to his uſual Solace: Empties his Bottle by Eleven: Comes home: Gets to Bed; and is inviſible till next Morning at Nine; and then riſing, enters upon his uſual Hurry and Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus did his Life ſeem to thoſe who ſaw him in his Buſineſs, one conſtant Scene of Fatigue, tho' he ſcarce ever apply'd to it Four regular Hours in any one Day. Whereas had he riſen <hi>only</hi> at Seven in the Morning, he would have got all his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under by Noon; and thoſe Two Hours, from Seven to Nine, being before many People go abroad, he would have met with no Interruption in his Affairs; but might have improved his Servants by his own Example, directed them in the Buſineſs of the Day, have inſpected his Books, written to his Dealers, and put every thing in ſo regular a Train, for the reſt of the Day, that whatever had occurr'd afterwards, would rather have ſerved to divert than fatigue him.</p>
                  <p>And what, to cut my Story ſhort, was the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the Matter? Why, meeting with ſome Diſappointments and Loſſes, (as all Traders muſt expect, and ought to provide for) and his Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0866800400:73"/>
not ſeeing him in his Shop ſo much as they expected, and when there, always in a diſobliging petulant Hurry; and moreover, Miſtakes frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happening through the Flurry into which he put himſelf and every one about him; by theſe means his Buſineſs dwindled away inſenſibly, and not being able to go out of his uſual Courſe, which helped to impair both his Capacity and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to Buſineſs, his Creditors began to look about them, and he was compelled to enter into the State of his Affairs; and then had the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find the Balance of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> againſt him.</p>
                  <p>This was a ſhocking Caſe to himſelf; but more to his Family; for his Wife had lived, and his Children had been educated, in ſuch a manner, as induced them to hope their Fortunes would be ſufficient to place them in a State of Independence.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, being obliged to quit a Buſineſs, he had managed with ſo little Prudence, his Friends got him upon a charitable Foundation, which afforded him bare Subſiſtence for himſelf. His Children were diſperſed ſome one way and ſome another, into low Scenes of Life, and his Wife went home to her Friends, to be ſnubb'd and reflected on by her own Family, for Faults not her own.</p>
                  <p>This Example will afford ſeveral good Hints, to a young Tradeſman, which are too obvious to need expatiating upon. And as I dare ſay, your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will keep you from the like Fault, you will never have Reaſon to reproach yourſelf on this Score. But yet, as I always found you in a Hurry, when I called upon you, I could not but give you this Hint, for fear you ſhould not rightly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Time to your Buſineſs, and leſt you ſhould ſuſpend to the <hi>next</hi> Hour, what you could and ought to do in the <hi>preſent,</hi> and ſo did not keep your Buſineſs properly under. Method is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0866800400:74"/>
every thing in Buſineſs, next to Diligence. And you will by falling into a regular one, always be calm and unruffled, and have time to beſtow in your Shop with your Cuſtomers; the Female ones eſpecially; who always love to make a great many Words in their Bargainings, and expect to be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd and perſuaded: And how can any Man find Time for this, if he prefers the Tavern to his Shop, and his Bed to his Buſineſs? I know you will take in good Part what I have written, becauſe you are ſenſible how much I am</p>

                  <p>AFTER the many Occaſions I have given for your Diſpleaſure, permit me to aſk your Advice in an Affair which may render my whole Life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable or miſerable. You know, Sir, to what a low Ebb my Folly and Extravagance have reduced me: Your generous Indulgence has made you ſtretch your Power, to my Shame I ſpeak it, even beyond the Bounds which Wiſdom, and a neceſſary Regard to the reſt of your Family would permit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I cannot hope for further Aſſiſtance from you. Something, however, I muſt reſolve upon to gain a Maintenance: And an Accident fell out Yeſterday, which offers me, at leaſt, preſent Bread.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> Maſter of one of the Theatres, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to dine at my Uncle's when I was there: After Dinner, the Subject of Diſcourſe was, the

Art of a Comedian: On which my Uncle took Occaſion to mention the little Flights in that way with which I have diverted myſelf in my gayer Moments; and partly compelled me to give an Inſtance of my Abilities. Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> was pleaſed to declare his Approbation of my Manner and Voice; and on being told my Circumſtances, offer'd, at once to take me into his Company with an Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſufficient for preſent Subſiſtence, and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Encouragement, as I ſhould be found to deſerve it. Half a Benefit he promiſed me the firſt Seaſon; which, by my (otherwiſe too) numerous Acquaintaince might, I believe, be turned to pretty good Account. I am not fond of this Life; but ſee no other Means of ſupporting myſelf like a Gentleman. Your ſpeedy Anſwer, will be ever gratefully acknowledged by, honoured Sir,</p>

                     <salute>Dear <hi>Jack,</hi>
                     </salute>

                  <p>I AM glad to find you improve both in <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Speech.</hi> You know I am no Witch at either: But ſo as we have ſome Wit in our Family, no matter who is at the Trouble of carrying it for what he'll get by it. I ſuppoſe you thought to give no ſmall Pleaſure to the Company laſt Night by your facetious Flings at all around you, not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0866800400:77"/>
excepting the Parſon himſelf: But ſhould you not have conſidered, that every one in the Room had a Right to return the Freedom you took, in the beſt manner he was able? Was it therefore well in you to reſent ſo warmly as you did, a ſmart Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, made by Mr. <hi>Criſpe,</hi> on a palpable Blunder of your own, when you had taken ſo much Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him, as well as every body elſe, juſt before? Indeed, Brother, you muſt either lay aſide Ridicule, or learn to bear it better; and in the preſent Caſe you ſhould have remember'd, that, in the manner you began with that Gentleman, it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to ſay any thing it would have been your Credit to reſent. A Retort on theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt be excuſed, tho' fraught with Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for a Man is not always in a Humour to be jeſted with, and it is the Duty of him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, to take what follows. Your failing in this known Rule; whatever you may think, has made you appear in ſo mean a Light to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that all your Acuteneſs will not in haſte atone for it.</p>
                  <p>If I judge rightly, nothing is more delicate than Ridicule: Where it is conducted with Prudence and Humour, it is ſure to pleaſe even the Man who is the Subject of it, if he is not of a moroſe Temper: But when, inſtead of that, perſonal Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or private Indiſcretions, are expoſed for the Entertainment of a Company, tho' you may think to raiſe a Laugh by it in the Unreflecting, it will bring upon you the Cenſure of the Conſiderate. It is our Duty to conſult what we can <hi>bear</hi> ourſelves, as well as what we can <hi>inflict</hi> on others. For my own Part, I know I cannot bear what is called a <hi>cloſe Rub,</hi> as many Men can, and for that Reaſon I never jeſt with any body, unleſs by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, and that I ſhorten all I can, leſt my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould not hold out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0866800400:78"/>
No doubt but you have more Humour than I; but if you do not blend in it a Quantity of Temper ſufficient to carry it off, you will be no Gainer by the Qualification. The Philoſopher ſays, That to <hi>Bear</hi> and <hi>Forbear,</hi> are the higheſt Points of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: If ſo, where is his Wiſdom, who will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the one or the other?

                     </gap> reflect upon his Judgment?</p>
                  <p>They are not leſs wiſe now, than when he made his Will; and if they happen to differ from your Judgment in any thing of Moment, what Room have you to ſuppoſe yourſelf better able to judge of the Conſequences of what you deſire, than they. I do not undervalue your good Senſe, and yet I muſt tell you, that (the Difference of Years conſider'd, and their Knowledge of the World, which yet you can know little of) it would he ſtrange if they did not know better than you, what was proper for you; and their Honeſty was never yet diſputed. Upon theſe Conſiderations, who is moſt probably to blame, ſhould you happen to diſagree? From ſuch Men, you will never meet more Reſtraints than is neceſſary for your Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Intereſt; for nothing that can injure <hi>you</hi> in any reſpect, can add to <hi>their</hi> Advantage or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. I have known ſeveral young Ladies of your Age impatient of the leaſt Controul, and think hardly of every little Contradiction; but when, by any unadviſed Step, they have releaſed themſelves, as they call it, from the Care of their try'd Friends, how often have they had Cauſe to repent their Raſhneſs? How ſeldom do you hear
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0866800400:81"/>
thoſe Ladies, who have ſubjected themſelves to what ſome reckon the greateſt Reſtraints while young, repent the Effects of them when grown up?</p>
                  <p>To mention the ſingle Article about which, generally, theſe Differences ariſe, that of Marriage: What good Fruits can a Lady hope, from the inſidious Progreſs of a clandeſtine Addreſs? A Man who can be worth a Lady's Acceptance, will never be aſhamed or afraid to appear openly. If he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to ſucceed, or is conſcious that he does, what need of concealing his Deſigns from her Friends? Muſt it not be with a View to get her in his Power, and by ſecuring a Place in her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, make her Weakneſs give Strength to <hi>his</hi> Preſumption, and forward thoſe Pretenſions that he knew would otherwiſe be rejected with Scorn?</p>
                  <p>Let me tell you, my dear Miſs, that you neither want Senſe nor Beauty; and no young Gentleman can be aſhamed of being <hi>known</hi> to love you.

                  <p>I AM ſorry to find you are grown jealous of your Huſband. 'Tis a moſt uneaſy Paſſion, and will be fatal, not only to your preſent Quiet, but to your future Happineſs, and probably to that of y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Your either <hi>have,</hi> or have <hi>not</hi> Cauſe for it. If you have Cauſe, look into yourſelf and your own Conduct, to ſee if you have not by any Change of Temper, or Diſagreeableneſs of Behaviour, alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated your Huſband's Affections; and if ſo, ſet about amending both, in order to recover them: for once he loved you, and you was ſatisfy'd he did, above all your Sex, or you would not have had him. If it be owing to his inconſtant Temper, that is indeed unhappy; but then, ſo long as you are clear of Blame, you have nothing to reproach <hi>yourſelf</hi> with: And as the Creatures wicked Men follow, omit nothing to oblige them, you muſt try to avoid ſuch uneaſy and diſturbing Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as will make you more and more diſtaſteful to him. Shew him, that no guilty Wretch's <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> Love can be equal to your <hi>real</hi> one: Shew him, that ſuch Creatures ſhall not out-do you in an <hi>obliging Behaviour,</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs of Temper;</hi> and that, let him fly off from <hi>his</hi> Duty, if he will, you will perſevere in <hi>yours.</hi> This Conduct will, if <hi>not immediately,</hi> in <hi>time,</hi> flaſh Conviction in his Face: He will ſee what a Goodneſs he injures, and will be ſoftened by your Softneſs. But if you make his Home uneaſy to him, he will fly both

                     <hi>that</hi> and <hi>you:</hi> And to whom will he fly, but, moſt probably, to one who will allow his Pleas, and aggravate every thing againſt you; who will ſide with him, inflame his Paſſions, and thereby ſecure him to herſelf? And would <hi>you</hi> contribute to ſuch a Wretch's Power over him, and furniſh Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for <hi>her</hi> to triumph over you? For while you exaſperate his Paſſions, and harden his Mind againſt you, ſhe will, by wicked Blandiſhments, ſhew him how obliging <hi>ſhe</hi> can be, and ſo a Courſe of Life, that he would follow privately, and by ſtealth, as it were, he will more openly purſue; he will grow ſhameleſs in it; and, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is the Vice, more's the Pity! will find thoſe who will extenuate it for <hi>their own</hi> ſakes, and throw the Blame on the Violence of your Temper, and ſay, you drive him into theſe Exceſſes.

                     <salute>Dear <hi>Bet,</hi>

                  <p>WHAT I wrote in my former, was on a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that you had too much Reaſon to be uneaſy at your Huſband's Conduct.</p>
                  <p>I will now purſue the Subject, and put the Caſe that you have no <hi>Proof</hi> that he is guilty, but your Surmizes, or, perhaps, the buſy <hi>Whiſperings</hi> of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Make-debates.</hi> In this Caſe, take care, my <hi>Betſey,</hi> that you don't, by the Violence of your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0866800400:84"/>
precipitate him on the Courſe you dread, and that you alienate not, by unjuſt Suſpicions, his Affections from you; for then perhaps he will be ready <hi>indeed</hi> to place them ſomewhere elſe, where you may not ſo eaſily draw him off; for he will, may be, think, as to <hi>you</hi> (if he be devoid of <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> Conſiderations) that he may as well <hi>deſerve</hi> your Suſpicions, as be tiezed with them <hi>without</hi> deſerving them.</p>
                  <p>I know it is a moſt ſhocking thing to a ſober young Woman, to think herſelf obliged to <hi>ſhare</hi> thoſe Affections which ought to be <hi>all her own,</hi> with a <hi>vile Proſtitute,</hi> beſides the Danger, which is not ſmall, of being intirely circumvented in her Huſband's <hi>Love,</hi> and perhaps have only his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,</hi> if not <hi>Contempt,</hi> inſtead of it. But, my Dear, at the worſt, comfort yourſelf that <hi>you</hi> are not the guilty Perſon, for one Day he will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, fatally find his Error. And conſider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, my <hi>Betſey,</hi> that your Caſe, from an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Huſband,</hi> is not near ſo bad as his would be from an unfaithful <hi>Wife:</hi> For, Child, he cannot make the Progeny of a <hi>Baſtard Race</hi> ſucceed to his and your Eſtate or Chattels, in Injury of your <hi>lawful Children.</hi> If any ſuch he ſhould have, the Law of the Land <hi>brands</hi> them: Whereas a <hi>naughty Wife</hi> often makes the Children of <hi>another Man,</hi> Heirs of her Huſband's Eſtate and Fortune, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of his <hi>own Children</hi> or <hi>Family.</hi> So, tho' the Crime may be equal in <hi>other Reſpects,</hi> yet this makes the Injury of the Woman to the Man, greater than <hi>his</hi> can be to <hi>her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Thoughts I have thrown together, as they occurred in two Letters, that I might not tire you with a Length, that, yet, the important Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Let me briefly ſum up the Contents.</p>

If he be <hi>guilty,</hi> try by Softneſs and kind Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations to reclaim him, before the Vice be rooted in him.

                  <p>I AM under no ſmall Concern, that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ill Courſes give me Occaſion to write this Letter to you. I was in hopes, that your ſolemn Promiſes of Amendment might have been better depended on; but I ſee, to my great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, that all I have done for you, and all I have ſaid to you, is thrown away. What can I ſay more than I <hi>have ſaid?</hi> Yet, <hi>once more</hi> am I deſirous to try what the Force of a <hi>Letter</hi> will do with one who has not ſuffer'd mere <hi>Words</hi> to have any Effect upon him. Perhaps this remaining with you, if you will now and then ſeriouſly peruſe it, may, in ſome happy Moment, give you <hi>Reflection,</hi> and by God's Grace, bring on your <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Amendment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider then, I beſeech you, in time, the Evil of your Ways. Make <hi>my</hi> Caſe <hi>your own;</hi> and think, if <hi>you</hi> were to be Father of ſuch a Son, how his Actions would grieve and afflict you. But if <hi>my</hi> Comfort has no Weight with you, conſider, my Son, how your preſent Courſes muſt impair, in time, a good Conſtitution, deſtroy your Health, and, moſt probably, ſhorten your Life. Conſider that your <hi>Reputation</hi> is wounded, I hope, not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0866800400:87"/>
as yet. That you will be ranked among the Profligate and Outcaſts of the World; that no virtuous Man will keep you Company; that every one who has a Regard for his own Credit will ſhun you; and that you will be given up to the Society of the <hi>worſt</hi> and <hi>moſt abandon'd</hi> of Men, when you might be improved by the Examples of the <hi>Beſt.</hi> That no Family which values their own Honour, and the Welfare of their Child, will ſuffer your Addreſſes to a Daughter worthy of being ſought after for a Wife, ſhould you incline to marry; and that the worſt of that Sex muſt probably, in that Caſe, fall to your Lot, which will make you miſerable in <hi>this World,</hi> when you might be happy.</p>
                  <p>Then, as to <hi>another World</hi> beyond this tranſitory one, my Heart trembles for what moſt probably will be the Conſequence to your poor Soul: For the human Mind is ſeldom <hi>at a ſtay;</hi> if you do not grow <hi>better,</hi> you will moſt undoubtedly grow <hi>worſe,</hi> and you may run into thoſe Sins and Evils, that you <hi>now</hi> perhaps think yourſelf incapable of; as <hi>already</hi> you are arrived at a Height of Folly and Wickedneſs, that once you would have thought you could not have been guilty of. Don't, my dear Son, let your poor Mother and me have the Mortification to think, that we have been the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Means of giving Life to a Child of Perdition, inſtead of a Child of Glory; that <hi>our</hi> beloved Son with all the Pains we have taken to inſtil good Principles into his Mind, in hopes he would one day prove a Credit and Comfort to his Family, ſhould, inſtead of anſwering our longing Wiſhes, when at Age, take ſuch contrary Courſes, as will make us join to wiſh he had never been born.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, my dear Son, we don't want any thing of <hi>you</hi> but <hi>your own Good.</hi> We lived before you were born. You have been a great Expence to us
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0866800400:88"/>
to bring you up to theſe Years. You cannot now live without <hi>us,</hi> but we can without <hi>you.</hi> We hope God will continue your Life to be ſtill a <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expence</hi> to us. For all we live for, is our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Good. Let then the <hi>Diſintereſtedneſs</hi> of our Plea move you. Be but good to <hi>yourſelf,</hi> that is all we require of you. Let us but have Reaſon to hope, that when we are <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>gone,</hi> you will ſupport our Name with Credit, and be no Burden to your poor Siſters, nor Diſgrace to our Memories. Shew us that you are of a <hi>generous,</hi> not of a <hi>ſordid</hi> Nature; and will probably ſet yourſelf above fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Misfortunes by reclaiming in time, and then we ſhall be happy. As God has done his Part by you, and given you Talents that every one cannot boaſt, let me beg you to conſider only, how much more noble it is to be in ſuch a Situation as ſhall enable you to <hi>confer</hi> Benefits, than ſuch an one as ſhall lay you under the poor Neceſſity to <hi>receive</hi> them from others, and, perhaps, where they ought to be leaſt expected.</p>
                  <p>I have written a long Letter. The Subject is <hi>next my Heart,</hi> and will excuſe it. God give a Bleſſing to it! God give you to ſee the Error of your Ways before it be too late, and before you get ſuch a Habit as you cannot alter if you would. Let your poor Mother and Siſters look upon you with <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> rather than <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> in caſe God Almighty ſhould take me away from them: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>YOU cannot imagine what a Concern your Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs and indifferent Management of your Affairs give me. Remiſſneſs is inexcuſable in all Men, but in none ſo much as in a Man of Buſineſs, the Soul of which is Induſtry, Diligence, and Punctuality.</p>
                  <p>Let me beg of you to ſhake off the idle Habits you have contracted; quit unprofitable Company, and unſeaſonable Recreations, and apply to your Compting-houſe with Diligence. It may not be yet too late to retrieve your Affairs. Inſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Gains, and caſt up what Proportion they bear to your Expences; and then ſee which of the latter you <hi>can,</hi> and which you <hi>cannot</hi> contract. Conſider, that when once a Man ſuffers himſelf to go backward in the World, it muſt be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Spirit of Induſtry that retrieves him, and puts him forward again.</p>
                  <p>Reflect, I beſeech you, before it be too late, upon the Inconveniencies which an impoveriſh'd Trader is put to, for the Remainder of his Life; which, too, may happen to be the prime Part of it; the Indignities he is likely to ſuffer from thoſe whoſe Money he has unthinkingly ſquander'd; the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0866800400:95"/>
Contempt he will meet with from all, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the idle Companions of his Folly; the Injuſtice he does his Family, in depriving his Children, not only of the Power of raiſing themſelves, but of living tolerably; and how, on the contrary, from being born to a creditable Expectation, he ſinks them into the loweſt Claſs of Mankind, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to the moſt dangerous Temptations. What has not ſuch a Father to anſwer for! and all this for the ſake of indulging himſelf in an idle, a careleſs, a thoughtleſs Habit, that cannot afford the leaſt Satisfaction, beyond the preſent Hour, if in that; and which muſt be attended with deep Remorſe, when he comes to reflect. Think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of theſe Things, and in time reſolve on ſuch a Courſe as may bring Credit to yourſelf, Juſtice to all you deal with, Peace and Pleaſure to your own Mind, Comfort to your Family; and which will give at the ſame time the higheſt Satisfaction to</p>

                     <salute>Dear Siſter,</salute>

                  <p>WE have often, by our good Mother, been warned againſt the Dangers that would too probably attend us on coming to <hi>London;</hi> tho' I muſt own, her Admonitions had not always the Weight I am now convinced they deſerved.</p>
                  <p>I have had a Deliverance from ſuch a Snare, as I never could have believed would have been laid for a Perſon free from all Thought of Ill, or been ſo near ſucceeding upon one ſo ſtrongly on her Guard as I imagined myſelf: And thus, my dear Siſter, the Matter happened:</p>
                  <p>Returning, on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> from ſeeing my Couſin <hi>Atkins,</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> I was over-taken by an elderly Gentlewoman of a ſober and creditable Appearance, who walked by my Side ſome little time before ſhe ſpoke to me; and then gueſſing, (by my aſking the Name of the Street) that I was a Stranger to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0866800400:97"/>
the Town, ſhe very courteouſly began a Diſcourſe with me, and after ſome other Talk, and Queſtions about my Country, and the like, deſired to know if I did not come to Town with a Deſign of going into ſome genteel Place? I told her, If I could meet with a Place to my Mind, to wait upon a ſingle Lady, I ſhould be very willing to embrace it. She ſaid, I look'd like a creditable, ſober and modeſt Body, and at that very time ſhe knew one of the beſt Gentlewomen that ever lived, who was in great Want of a Maid to attend upon her own Perſon, and that if ſhe liked me, and I her, it would be a lucky Incident for us both.</p>
                  <p>I expreſſed myſelf thankfully, and ſhe was ſo very much in my Intereſt, as to intreat me to go inſtantly to the Lady, leſt ſhe ſhould be provided, and acquaint her I was recommended by Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> not doubting, as ſhe ſaid, but, on Inquiry, my Character would anſwer my Appearance.</p>
                  <p>As that you know was partly my View in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Town, I thought this a happy Incident, and determined not to loſe the Opportunity; and ſo, according to the Direction ſhe gave me, I went to inquire for Mrs. <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>
                     </hi>; ſhe came to me, dreſs'd in a ſplendid Manner; I told her what I came about; ſhe immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to walk into the Parlour, which was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly furniſhed; and after aſking me ſeveral Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, with my Anſwers to which ſhe ſeem'd very well pleaſed, a Servant ſoon brought in a Bowl of warm Liquor, which ſhe called <hi>Negus,</hi> conſiſting of Wine, Water, Orange, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, ſhe ſaid, was for a Friend or two ſhe expected preſently; but as I was warm with walking, ſhe would have me drink ſome of it, telling me it was a pleaſant innocent Liquor,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0866800400:98"/>
and ſhe always uſed her waiting Maids, as ſhe did herſelf. I thought this was very kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending, and being warm and thirſty, and ſhe encouraging me, I took a pretty free Draught of it, and thought it very pleaſant, as it really was. She made me ſit down by her, ſaying, Pride was not her Talent, and that ſhe ſhould always indulge me in like manner, if I behaved well, when ſhe had not Company: and then ſlightly aſked what I could do, and the Wages I required? With my Anſwers ſhe ſeemed well ſatisfied, and granted the Wages I aſked, without any Offer of Abatement.</p>
                  <p>And then I roſe up, in order to take my Leave, telling her I would, any Day ſhe pleaſed, of the enſuing Week, bring my Cloaths, and wait upon her.</p>
                  <p>She ſaid, that her own Maid being gone away, ſhe was in the utmoſt Want of another, and would take it kindly, if I would ſtay with her till next Day, becauſe ſhe was to have ſome Ladies to paſs the Evening with her. I ſaid this would be pretty inconvenient to me, but as ſhe was ſo ſituated, I would oblige her, after I had been with my Aunt, and acquainted her with it. To this ſhe reply'd, that there was no manner of Occaſion for that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe could ſend the Cook for what I wanted, who could, at the ſame time, tell my Aunt how Matters ſtood.</p>
                  <p>I thought this looked a little odd; but ſhe did it with ſo much Civility, and ſeemed ſo pleaſed with her new Maid, that I ſcarcely knew how to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her: But the Apprehenſion I had of my Aunt's Anger for not aſking her Advice, in what ſo nearly concerned me, made me inſiſt upon going, though I could perceive Diſpleaſure in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance when ſhe ſaw me reſolv'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0866800400:99"/>
She then ply'd me very cloſe with the Liquor, which ſhe again ſaid was innocent and weak; but I believe it was far otherwiſe; for my Head began to turn round, and my Stomach felt a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered. I intreated the Favour of her to permit me to go, on a firm Promiſe of returning imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; but then, my new Miſtreſs began to raiſe her Voice a little, aſſuring me I ſhould on no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſtir out of her Houſe. She left the Room, in a ſort of a Pet, but ſaid ſhe would ſend the Cook to take my Directions to my Aunt; and I heard her take the Key out of the outward Door.</p>
                  <p>This alarmed me very much; and, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of my Surprize, a young Gentlewoman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Parlour, dreſs'd in white Sattin, and every way genteel; ſhe ſat down in a Chair next me, looked earneſtly at me a while, and ſeemed going to ſpeak ſeveral times, but did not. At length ſhe roſe from her Chair, bolted the Parlour-door, and, breaking into a Flood of Tears, expreſs'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Dear young Woman, I cannot tell you the Pain I feel on your Account; and from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſerve you, I run a Hazard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving myſelf in greater Miſery than I have yet experienced, if that can be. But my Heart is yet too honeſt to draw others, as I am deſir'd to do, into a Snare which I have fallen into myſelf. You are now in as notorious a Brothel, as is in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> And if you eſcape not in a few Hours, you are inevitably undone. I was once as innocent as you now ſeem to be. No Apprehenſion you can be under for your Virtue, but I felt as much: My Name was as unſpotted, and my Heart as unvers'd in Ill, when I firſt entered theſe guilty Doors, whither I was ſent on an Errand, much like what I underſtand has brought you hither. I

My Liberty I intreated to no Purpoſe, and my Grief ſerved for the cruel Sport of all around me. In ſhort, I have been now ſo long confined, that I am aſhamed to appear among my Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. In this dreadful Situation, I have been perplexed with the hateful Importunities of different Men every Day; and tho' I long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to my utmoſt, yet downright Force never failed to overcome. Thus in a ſhameful Round of Guilt and Horror, have I lingered out Ten Months; ſubject to more Miſeries than Tongue can expreſs. The ſame ſad Lot is intended you, nor will it be eaſy to ſhun it: However, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be more miſerable than I am, I will aſſiſt you what I can; and not, as the wretched Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſs hopes, contribute to make you as unhappy as myſelf."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may gueſs at the Terror that ſeized my Heart, on this ſad Story, and my own Danger; I trembled in every Joint, nor was I able to ſpeak for ſome time; at laſt, in the beſt Manner I could, I thanked my unhappy new Friend, and begg'd ſhe would kindly give me the Aſſiſtance ſhe offered: which ſhe did; for the firſt Gentleman that came to the Door, ſhe ſtept up herſelf for the Key to let him in, which the wretched Procureſs gave her, and I took that Opportunity, as ſhe directed, to run out of the Houſe, and that in ſo much Hurry

and Confuſion, as to leave my Hood, Fan, and Gloves behind me.</p>

                  <p>I TAKE the Freedom of a brief Expoſtulation with you on your Behaviour to your Father; and I hope you will receive it from me, with the ſame Good-will, that I mean it.</p>
                  <p>His Indulgence to you formerly, certainly claims better Returns on your Part, altho' it ſhould be allow'd, as you fondly imagine, that his Affection to you is alienated. There may be ſomething of Petulancy in him, which you ought to bear with; for one time or other you may be convinced by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that <hi>Age</hi> itſelf has its inſuperable Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that require the Allowance of every one; and more particularly of ſuch who hope to live a long Life themſelves, and ſtill more particularly of a <hi>Son,</hi> whoſe <hi>high Paſſions,</hi> require, perhaps, at leaſt as <hi>much</hi> Allowance. He may be <hi>petulant;</hi> but are you not <hi>fiery</hi> and <hi>impetuous?</hi> And I would fain know, whether <hi>you</hi> ought to bear with <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>he</hi> with <hi>you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a very groundleſs Surmiſe to think his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are alienated from you. A Father <hi>muſt</hi> love his Son. He cannot help it. And is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible even to yourſelf, on cool Reflexion, that the ſame good Man who was wont to be delighted with your childiſh Vanities and Foibles, (for we have all had them more or leſs) and even indulged and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cheriſhed thoſe youthful Forwardneſſes, that might be called the Seeds of thoſe Paſſions, which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0866800400:104"/>
now, being ſprung up, give him ſo much Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and make you ſo impatient of Contradiction: Can you, I ſay, believe that this ſame good Man, without Reaſon, without Provocation, can change that Love into Hate?</p>
                  <p>You are grown to Man's Eſtate, and tho' far from the ungracious Sons, that we have ſeen in the World, yet ought not to be ſo partial to yourſelf, as to believe you are wholly faultleſs. Examine your own Conduct then, and altho' you ſhould not be able to charge your <hi>Intention</hi> with any Blame, yet you muſt leave your <hi>Behaviour</hi> to be judg'd by others; and 'twill perhaps be given againſt you, that ſome Slight, ſome Negligence, ſome Inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not worſe, too cutting for a Father's Cares and Fondneſs to ſupport, has eſcaped you. Then conſider, Sir, what a grievous thing it muſt be to him to reflect, that this Behaviour of yours, may be but the gradual Conſequence of his former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to you, and that he is deſervedly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for not rooting up in your childiſh Days thoſe Weeds which now ſpread to his Uneaſineſs. But let me tell you, Sir, that it ought to be a more ſad Reflection to a conſiderate young Gentleman, that <hi>he</hi> is to be the Inſtrument to puniſh his fond Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's faulty Indulgence to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have been a diligent Obſerver of the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence in this reſpect, and have always ſeen the Sin of Undutifulneſs to Parents puniſhed in <hi>Kind,</hi> more than any one Sin. I have ſeen the <hi>Son</hi> of the undutiful Son, revenging the Cauſe of his <hi>Grandfather;</hi> and at the ſame time, intail'd a Curſe upon <hi>his</hi> Son, if he has not been taken off childleſs, who, in his Turn, has retorted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious Behaviour; and thus a Curſe has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd by Deſcent upon the Family, from one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another.</p>

You'll ſay, that your Behaviour to your Father is not, you hope, of ſuch an atrocious Nature, as to be attended with ſuch terrible Conſequences; and perhaps will add, that you do not wiſh for a better Behaviour from your Son, than you ſhew to your Father. But if this be not Partiality to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, pray conſider, that while your Father takes your preſent Conduct in ſo ill Part, and you uſe ſo little Circumſpection to avoid giving him Diſguſt, and have ſo little Complaiſance, as not to ſet him right; the thing is full as tormenting to him from the <hi>Appearance,</hi> as if it were <hi>real;</hi> nay, 'tis <hi>real</hi> to him, if he <hi>believes</hi> ſo.</p>
                  <p>He thinks, and let me tell you, Sir, he thinks <hi>juſtly,</hi> that he ought to expect as much Deference to <hi>his</hi> Will and Pleaſure <hi>now,</hi> as he has heretofore ſhewn you Indulgence, even in thoſe things that now perhaps you are ſo unkind to ſuffer to turn ſevereſt upon him. I would not recriminate: But it was with very little Reverence, and indeed with an <hi>Air</hi> as cenſurable as the <hi>Words,</hi> that you told him, in my Hearing, that he knew not what he would have: That he expected you to be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable at <hi>this</hi> Age, than when you were a <hi>Child,</hi> &amp;c. Why, dear Sir, does your being <hi>of Age,</hi> leſſen the Duty you owe to your Father? Are not his Cares for you allowably <hi>doubled,</hi> and ought he not now to expect from your good Senſe, and more mature Underſtanding (improved, as it is to be hoped, by the Education he has, at a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, given you) <hi>greater</hi> Proofs of Duty, rather than <hi>leſs?</hi> He may forget, perhaps what he <hi>was at your Age,</hi> as you irreverently told him; but how much more laudable would it be, for you, at <hi>yours,</hi> to enter into what you would naturally expect from <hi>your Son,</hi> were you in the <hi>Place,</hi> and at the <hi>Age,</hi> of <hi>your Father.</hi> A generous Mind will do its Duty,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0866800400:106"/>
tho' it were not to meet with ſuitable Rewards or Returns; for even ſhould your Father not do <hi>his</hi> by <hi>you,</hi> you are not abſolved of <hi>yours</hi> to <hi>him;</hi> much leſs then, ought the <hi>natural,</hi> the <hi>conſequential,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of <hi>Age,</hi> to diſſolve the Duty of a Son to an indulgent Parent.</p>
                  <p>Be convinced, my dear Sir, of your wrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and don't think it beneath the high Spirit of a brave young Gentleman, to ſubmit to the Will of his Father. By your Dutifulneſs and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection you may, in all Probability, add to the Number as well as the Comfort of <hi>his</hi> Days to whom you owe <hi>your</hi> Being. But whar a Woe does that young Man bring upon himſelf who robs his aged Parent in <hi>both</hi> reſpects! It behoves all Children to reflect upon this timely, and with Awe.</p>
                  <p>On how many Occaſions has he heretofore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to me, on, even, the ſmalleſt Openings and Dawnings of your Mind and Genius! How has he dwelt on your Praiſes on even <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Beauties, which have appeared ſuch to his fond and partial Tenderneſs only! How has he extenuated your Failings, connived at your Faults, and extolled and brought forward into ſtrong Light, even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Appearance of Virtue in you. Such <hi>was</hi> always, and ſuch, notwithſtanding the Intermixtures of <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and even of your continued <hi>Slights</hi> and <hi>Impatience,</hi> always <hi>will be,</hi> the Inſtances of his paternal Affection for you. And I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that even this very Petulance, as you think it, is a Demonſtration of his Regard for you, however diſagreeable it may be to you, ſince he loves you too well to be inſenſible to thoſe Parts of your Behaviour, which he thinks are owing to Slight or Negligence.</p>
                  <p>I have exceeded the Bounds I intended when I began, and would rather leave to your natural good
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0866800400:107"/>
Senſe, and cooler Reflection, what I have <hi>already</hi> urged, than tire you too much, with what might <hi>ſtill farther</hi> be added on this Occaſion. But the Affection and Friendſhip I have for all your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the long Intimacy I have had with your good Father (who, however, knows nothing of my writing) and the evil Conſequences that may follow a wider Breach between you, will anſwer for my Intention, and, I hope, for my Freedom, which I'll take upon me to ſay, I <hi>expect</hi> from your Candor and Education, being</p>

                  <head>LETTER LXV. Againſt too great a Love of Singing and Muſick.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Couſin,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM ſure you have the good Senſe to take kindly what I am going to mention to you, in which I can have no poſſible View but your Benefit. When you were laſt with me at <hi>Hertford,</hi> you much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged us all, with the Inſtances you gave us of your Skill in Muſick, and your good Voice. But as you are ſo young a Man, and ſeem to be ſo very much pleaſed <hi>yourſelf</hi> with theſe Acquirements, I muſt enter a Caution or two on this Score, becauſe of the Conſequences that may follow from too much Delight in theſe Amuſements, which, while they are purſued as Amuſements <hi>only,</hi> may be ſafe and innocent; but when they take up too much of a Man's Time, may be not a little pernicious.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, my dear Couſin, theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Sound,</hi> may take you off from the more deſirable ones of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and make your Delights
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0866800400:108"/>
ſtop at the <hi>Ear,</hi> which ſhould go deeper, and be placed in the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> For whenever a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Singer is in Company, adieu to all Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an improving or intellectual Nature.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, it may expoſe you to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> and that not the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> eligible neither; and by which your <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and your other <hi>more uſeful</hi> Studies, may be greatly if not wholly neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and very poſſibly your <hi>Health</hi> itſelf much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, it may tend, for ſo it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally does, to <hi>enervate the Mind,</hi> and make you haunt muſical Societies, Operas and Concerts; and what Glory is it to a Gentleman if he were even a fine Performer, that he can ſtrike a String, touch a Key, or ſing a Song with the Grace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a <hi>hired Muſician?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Muſick, to arrive at any tolerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in it, takes up <hi>much Time,</hi> and requires ſo much Application, as leaves but little <hi>Room,</hi> and, what is worſe, when delighted in, little <hi>Inclination</hi> for other Improvements: And as Life is a <hi>ſhort</hi> Stage, where <hi>longeſt,</hi> ſurely the moſt precious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, ought to be better imploy'd, than in ſo light and airy an Amuſement. The Time of <hi>Youth</hi> will be ſoon over, and that is the Time of laying the Foundation of more ſolid Studies. The <hi>Mind,</hi> as well as the <hi>Body,</hi> will become ſtiff by Years, and unſuſceptible of thoſe Improvements, that cannot be attained, but in particular Periods of it: And, once an airy Delight engages the Faculties, a Habit is formed; and nothing but great Struggle, and abſolute Neceſſity, if <hi>that</hi> will do it, can ſhake it off. One Part of Life is for <hi>Improvement,</hi> that is <hi>Youth;</hi> another Part is for turning that Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſolid Benefits to one's Self, one's Family, or Acquaintance; that is the <hi>middle Part;</hi> another
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0866800400:109"/>
Part carries a Retroſpect to a <hi>future Eſtate:</hi> And ſhall we loſe the Time of <hi>Improvement,</hi> which can never come again; forfeit all the Benefits of it, in our <hi>Middle-life,</hi> and embitter our <hi>future Proſpect,</hi> as well <hi>mundane</hi> as <hi>eternal,</hi> with Reflections on our paſt Neglect of Opportunities that never can be recalled? And all for what? Why, only to be deemed for eight or ten empty Years of Life, <hi>a good Companion,</hi> as the Phraſe is:—Tho', perhaps, a bad <hi>Huſband,</hi> a bad <hi>Father,</hi> a bad <hi>Friend,</hi> and, of courſe, a bad <hi>Man!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there are, who divide Life into four Stages or Opportunities. He, they ſay, who is not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by Twenty, ſtrong by Thirty, wiſe by Forty, rich by Fifty, will never be either <hi>handſome, ſtrong, wiſe,</hi> or <hi>rich.</hi> And this, generally ſpeaking, is a good and improving Obſervation; which ſhould teach us, as we go along, to make a right Uſe of thoſe Periods of Life, which may be proper Entrances for us into a ſtill more important one than that behind it.</p>
                  <p>I have but lightly touched on theſe weighty Points, becauſe I know you have good Senſe enough to improve as much from Hints, as others can from tedious Lectures. And when I have repeated, that I am far from diſſuading you from theſe Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments while they are reſtrained to due Bounds, and are regarded as Amuſements <hi>only;</hi> I know you will think me, what I always deſire to be thought, and what I truly am,</p>

                  <p>THE kind Indulgence you have always ſhewn to your Children, makes me preſume to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Advocate for my <hi>Siſter,</hi> tho' not for her <hi>Fault.</hi> She is very ſenſible of <hi>that,</hi> and ſorry ſhe has offended you; but has great hopes, that Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> will prove ſuch a careful and loving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to her, as may atone for his paſt Wildneſs, and engage your Forgiveneſs. For all your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſenſible of your paternal Kindneſs, and that you wiſh their Good more for their ſakes, than <hi>your own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This makes it the more wicked to offend ſo good a Father: But, dear Sir, be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it now cannot be helped, and that ſhe may be made by your Diſpleaſure very miſerable in her own Choice; and as his Faults are owing to the Inconſideration of Youth, or otherwiſe it would not have been a very diſcreditable Match, had it had your Approbation; I could humbly hope, for my poor Siſter's ſake, that you will be pleaſed rather to encourage his preſent good Reſolutions, by your kind Favour, than make him deſpair of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and ſo perhaps treat her with a Negligence, which hitherto ſhe is not apprehenſive of. For he is really very fond of her, and I hope will continue ſo.

What I mean, is an immoderate Inclination to make your Spouſe, and your Children, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Diſcourſe where-ever you are. Imagine not that any Pique or Diſlike draws this from me: My Siſter, I think, is poſſeſſed of as many valuable Qualities as moſt of her Sex; and all your Children are very promiſing.

                  <p>I WAS greatly ſurpriſed at the Letter you ſent me laſt Week. I was willing to believe I ſaw in you, for your Years, ſo much of your late dear Mother's Temper, Prudence, and virtuous Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that I refuſed ſeveral advantageous Offers of changing my own Condition, purely for your ſake: And will you now convince me ſo early, that I have no Return to expect from you, but that the Moment a young Fellow throws himſelf in your way, you have nothing elſe to do, but to give me Notice to provide a Fortune for you? for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0866800400:115"/>
that you intend to be of no further Uſe and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me. This, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is the Meaning of your Notification. For I ſuppoſe your young Man does not intend to marry you, without a Fortune. And can you then think, that a Father has nothing to do, but to confer Benefits on his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without being intitled to expect any Return from them?</p>
                  <p>To be ſure, I had propoſed, at a proper Time, to find a Huſband for you; but I thought I had yet three or four Years to come. For, conſider, <hi>Sally,</hi> you are not fully Sixteen Years of Age: And a Wife, believe me, ought to have ſome better Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, than an agreeable Perſon to <hi>preſerve</hi> a <hi>Huſband's Eſteem,</hi> tho' it often is enough to <hi>attract a Lover's Notice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Have you Experience enough, think you, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly to conduct the Affairs of a Family? I thought you as yet not quite capable to manage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I CANNOT ſay I look upon Mr. <hi>La Farriere</hi> in the ſame favourable Light that you ſeem to do. His frothy Behaviour may divert well enough as an Acquaintance; but is very unanſwerable, I think, to the Character of a Huſband, eſpecially an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Huſband, which I take to be a graver Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter than a <hi>French</hi> one. There is a Difference in theſe gay Gentlemen, while they <hi>ſtrive to pleaſe,</hi> and when they <hi>expect to be obliged.</hi> In all Men this is too apparent: But in thoſe of a light Turn it is more viſible than in others. If after Marriage his preſent Temper ſhould continue, when <hi>you</hi> are a careful Mother, <hi>he</hi> will look more like a Son than a Huſband: If entering into the World ſhould change his Diſpoſition, expect no Medium; he will be the moſt inſipid Mortal you can imagine; if his Spirits ſhould be depreſſed by the Accidents of Life, he is ſuch a Stranger to Reflection, (the beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of the Wiſe) that from thence he will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to draw Relief. And Adverſity to ſuch Men is the more intolerable, as their Deportment is ſuited only to the Smiles of Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>dances</hi> well; <hi>writes</hi> very indifferently: Is an Artiſt at <hi>Cards;</hi> but cannot caſt <hi>Accounts:</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands all the Laws of <hi>Chance;</hi> but not one of the <hi>Land:</hi> Has ſhewn great Skill in the Improvement of his <hi>Perſon;</hi> yet none at all, that I hear, of his <hi>Eſtate:</hi> And tho' he makes a good Figure in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>

                  <p>I HAVE ſeveral times, that I have been happy in the Company of your beloved Niece, thought to have ſpoken my Mind, and to declare to her the true Value and Affection I have for her. But juſt as I have been about to ſpeak, my Fears have vanquiſh'd my Hopes, and I have been obliged to ſuſpend my Purpoſe. I have thrown out ſeveral Hints, that I thought would have led the way to a fuller diſcloſing of the Secret that is too big for my Breaſt, and yet, when I am near her, is too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for Utterance.

                  <p>I CANNOT ſay I have any Diſlike, as to my own part, to your Propoſal, or your Manner of making it, whatever my Niece may have: becauſe Diffidence is generally the Companion of Merit, and a Token of Reſpect: She is a Perſon of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all her Friends are ſo throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it, that her Choice will have the Weight it deſerves with us all: So I cannot ſay, what will be the Event of your Declaration to her.

                  <p>I HAVE long ſtruggled with the moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and reſpectful Paſſion that ever filled the Heart of Man. I have often try'd to reveal it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally; as often in this way; but never till now could prevail upon my Fears and Doubts. But I can no longer ſtruggle with a Secret that has given me ſo much Torture to keep, and yet hitherto more, when I have endeavoured to reveal it. I never entertain the Hope to ſee you, without Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

but when I have that Pleaſure, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>animated</hi> as I ought, I am utterly confounded. What can this be owing to, but a Diffidence in myſelf, and an exalted Opinion of your Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And is not this one ſtrong Token of ardent Love! Yet if it be, how various is the tormenting Paſſion in its Operations! Since ſome it inſpires with Courage, while others it deprives of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Confidence. I can only aſſure you, Madam, that the Heart of Man never conceived a ſtronger or ſincerer Paſſion than mine for you. If my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for you is my Crime, I am ſure it has been my ſufficient Puniſhment. I need not ſay my Deſigns and Motives are honourable: Who dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo much virtuous Excellence, with a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſuch an Aſſurance is neceſſary?

                  <p>I AM glad to hear you're in the Land of the Living ſtill. You expect from me an Account of what has happen'd among your old Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſince you have been abroad. I will give it you, and, 'bating that two or three Years al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make vaſt Alterations in <hi>mature</hi> Life, you would be ſurpris'd at the Havock and Changes that ſmall Space of Time has made in the Circle of our Acquaintance. To begin them with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: I have had the Misfortune to loſe my Son <hi>Jo;</hi> and my Daughter <hi>Judy</hi> is marry'd, and has brought me another <hi>Jo. Jack Kid</hi> of the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> where we kept our Club, has loſt his Wife, who was a ſpecial Bar-keeper, got his Maid <hi>Priſe,</hi> with Child—you remember the Slut, by her mincing Airs—marry'd her, and is broke: But not till he had, with his horrid Stum, poiſon'd half the Society. We began to complain of his Wine, you know, before you left us; and I told him he ſhould let <hi>us</hi> have Neat, who drank our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0866800400:122"/>
Gallons, if he was honeſt to <hi>himſelf;</hi> and, if he was to regard <hi>Conſcience</hi> as well as <hi>Intereſt,</hi> muſt do leſs Harm by diſpenſing his Rats-bane to thoſe who drank Pints, than to thoſe honeſt Fellows who ſwallow'd Gallons, and, in ſo handſome a Doſe of the one, muſt take a too large Quantity of the other: But the Dog was incorrigible; for he went on brewing and poiſoning, till he kill'd his beſt Cuſtomers, and then what could he expect?</p>
                  <p>Why what follow'd; for, truly, <hi>Bob,</hi> we began to tumble like rotten Sheep. As thus: The Dance was begun by that ſeaſon'd Sinner <hi>Tim. Brackley,</hi> the Half-pint Man, who was always ſotting by himſelf, with his <hi>Whets</hi> in the Morning, his <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives</hi> after Dinner, and <hi>Digeſters</hi> at Night, and at laſt tipt off of one of the Kitchen-benches in an Apoplexy. 'Tis true he was not of our Club; tho' we might have taken Warning by <hi>his Fall,</hi> as the Saying is; but were above it. So the Rot got among us; and firſt, honeſt laughing <hi>Jack Adams</hi> kick'd up of a Fever. <hi>Tom Dandy</hi> fell into a Jaundice and Dropſy, and when his Doctors ſaid he was mending, ſlipt thro' their Fingers, in ſpite of their Art and Aſſurance. <hi>Roger Harman,</hi> the Punſter, then tipt off the Perch, after very little Warning: And was follow'd in a Week by <hi>Arthur Sykes. Ralph Atkyns</hi> bid us Good-bye in a few Months after him. And <hi>Ben. Tomlyns,</hi> who, you remember, would never go home ſober, tumbled down Stairs, and broke his Collar-bone. His <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> took him firſt, a <hi>Fever</hi> next, then his <hi>Doctor;</hi> and then, as it were of courſe, <hi>Death:</hi> A natural Round enough, you'll ſay, <hi>Bob.</hi> His Widow made a handſome Burial for poor <hi>Ben.;</hi> took on grievouſly, and in Five Weeks married her Journeyman. <hi>Jemmy Hawkins</hi> was a long time ailing, yet would not leave off; ſo he dy'd, as one may ſay, of a <hi>more</hi>

natural Death. <hi>Ralph Rawlins</hi> ſell ſick, after a large Doſe; and had ſo narrow an Eſcape, that he was ſrighten'd into a Regimen; and now drinks Aſſes Milk of another Complexion than that which gave him his Malady; and between <hi>Phyſick</hi> and the <hi>Hyp,</hi> ſerves for a <hi>Memento Mori</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> and neither lives nor dies himſelf. While honeſt Capt. <hi>Tinker,</hi> who was deep gone in a Conſumption, is in very little better Caſe: And if any thing ſaves <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> and the reſt of our once numerous Society, it will be the Bankruptcy of our worthy Landlord; for that has quite broke us up.</p>
                  <p>So much for the <hi>Club,</hi> Bob. Now to the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood</hi> about us, that you and I knew next beſt.</p>

                     <hi>Jerry Jenkyns,</hi> the prim Mercer, has had a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute taken out againſt him, and 5 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound is all the Reſult of his pragmatical Fluttering. <hi>Dan. Pocock</hi> the Draper has had an Eſtate left him, and quitted Buſineſs: While <hi>Sam. Simpſon</hi> the Grocer has loſt one in Law, and gone mad upon it. See, <hi>Bob,</hi> the Ups and Downs of this tranſitory State! <hi>Harry Barlow</hi> the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchant has left off to his Nephew, and now pines for want of Employment. <hi>Joſhua Williams</hi> the Cheeſemonger, a ſtrange projecting Fellow, you know! is carried out of his Shop into a Sponging-houſe by <hi>his own Maggots. John Jones</hi> the Organiſt is married to <hi>Sykes</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Peggy,</hi> who proves an arrant Shrew, and has broke about his Head his beſt <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> Fiddle, in the Sight of half a dozen Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The Wiſe of <hi>Job Johnſon,</hi> our Sword-cutler, has elop'd from him. You know they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways liv'd like Dog and Cat. <hi>Paul Lane</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Poll</hi> has had a Baſtard by 'Squire <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s Coachman; and the 'Squire's own Daughter Miſs <hi>Nelly</hi> has run away with her Father's Poſtilion. <hi>Dick Jenkyns,</hi> that vile Rake and Beau, is turn'd

                     <hi>Quaker;</hi> and that ſtill greater Libertine, <hi>Peter Mottram, Methodiſt:</hi> While old <hi>Satan,</hi> to make up his Loſs in theſe two, has ſubdued <hi>Will Wigley,</hi> and <hi>Tom Allen,</hi> who you know uſed to be very hopeful young Fellows, and are now Rakes of the Town. <hi>Tony Williams</hi> I had like to have forgot. He has cheated all our Expectations, having eſcaped the Gallows, and dy'd a natural Death, after a hundred Rogueries, every one of which deſerved Hanging.</p>
                  <p>Parſon <hi>Matthews</hi> goes on preaching and living excellently, and has ſtill as many Admirers as Hearers, but no Preferment: While old clumſy Parſon <hi>Dromedary</hi> is made a Dean, and has Hopes, by his Siſter's means, who is a Favourite of a certain great Man, to be a Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>As to News of a <hi>publick</hi> Nature, the Papers, which no doubt you ſee, in the monthly Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions at leaſt, will inform you beſt of that.

They never did <hi>one good thing,</hi> ſays the <hi>Enemy.</hi> They never did <hi>one bad</hi> one, ſays the Friend. For my own part, I think, conſidering the undoubted Truth of the Maxim <hi>Humanum eſt errare,</hi> and how much eaſier it is to find a Fault than to mend one, the Gentlemen in the Adminiſtration will be well off, if the Publick will <hi>middle</hi> the Matter between the two <hi>Extremes.</hi> Mean time one Side goes on, <hi>accuſing</hi> without <hi>Mercy;</hi> the other, <hi>acquitting</hi> without <hi>Shame.</hi> 'Tis the Buſineſs of <hi>one Set</hi> of Papers to <hi>beſpatter</hi> and <hi>throw Dirt;</hi> and of the <hi>other</hi> to follow after them, with a <hi>Scrubbing-bruſh</hi> and a <hi>Diſh-clout:</hi> And after all—the one <hi>bedaubs</hi>

ſo <hi>plentifully,</hi> and the other <hi>wipes</hi> off ſo <hi>ſlovenly,</hi> that, let me be hang'd, <hi>Bob,</hi> if I'd appear on <hi>'Change</hi> with the Coat on my Back that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Man ſtalks about in, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, when theſe <hi>Dawbers</hi> and <hi>Scowerers</hi> have done their <hi>worſt</hi> and their <hi>beſt</hi> upon it.

                  <p>I HAVE made my Addreſſes, in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I can, to Miſs <hi>Dawley,</hi> but have not the leaſt Room to boaſt of my Succeſs: The Account you gave me of her good Senſe, and many uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Qualifications, will not permit me to arraign
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0866800400:126"/>
her Conduct; and the good Opinion I have long entertained of myſelf, makes me very ſlow in blaming my own. I would have obey'd your Orders to write to you ſooner, but knew not what to ſay; and by waiting till I began to fear you would think me negligent, I am in no better Condition. I firſt declared my Regard for her in a manner I thought moſt ſuitable for that Purpoſe. She very encouragingly made me no Anſwer; and when I ſpoke again upon the Subject, ſhe aſk'd how you did, and was glad to hear you were well. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out of my Play, I talk'd of indifferent Things a good while, and at laſt fell again upon the Reaſon of my attending her. She order'd the Cloth to be laid, and complaiſantly hoped I would ſtay Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I had no more Opportunity for that time.</p>
                  <p>Two Days after, I repeated my Viſit. She receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at firſt politely; but when I began to reſume the Subject I came upon, ſhe rung for the Maid, and bad her put on the Tea-kettle. About ſix Viſits paſſed before I could obtain one Word to my Buſineſs: And the firſt Thing ſhe anſwer'd upon that Head was, That Length of Time was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the making of an Acquaintance that muſt not be either bluſhed at, or repented of: This ſhe ſpoke with ſuch an Air of Gravity, as put what I would have reply'd, quite out of my Head. Yet next Viſit I began again. I told her how happy I ſhould think myſelf, if I could be encouraged to hope for the ſmalleſt Share of her Favour. But ſhe made me ſuch an odd Anſwer, as plainly demonſtrated to me, that I had more of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt than Approbation. This made me as earneſt as ſhe, to wave the Subject; and ſo we went on upon the Weather, for a whole Week before; and when we had done that, we talk'd Politicks: And Admiral <hi>Vernon,</hi> and Lord <hi>Cathcart's</hi> Expedition,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0866800400:127"/>
and the like Stuff, took Place. So that, in ſhort, after Two Months Study how to accompliſh the Happineſs you pointed out for me, I find myſelf not one ſingle Step advanced; for when I ſee her now, we both talk with ſeeming Satisfaction, on any Subject where Love has no Part: but when that is introduced, all her eaſy Eloquence ſinks into Reſerve.</p>
                  <p>I would not determine to give up my Addreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had your farther Advice: In hopes of which I am,</p>

                  <p>I Thought you had been better acquainted with the Art of Love, than to be ſo eaſily out of Heart. That ſuch a Lady as Miſs <hi>Dawley</hi> has not forbid your Viſits, let me tell you, is Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as much as you ought to expect. She is a Lady of fine Senſe, and has had the Advantage of as fine an Education; and you muſt not expect a Lady of her Prudence and Merit, will be won by general Compliments; or that her Affection will be moved by the Notion of a ſudden and precipitate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Her Judgment muſt be firſt touch'd; for ſhe views Marriage as a ſerious Thing: By it her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was made happy, and her Siſter undone. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the Continuation of your Addreſſes; for a more deſerving Lady than Miſs, does not live.

                  <p>I Remember that one of the Ancients, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a Youth in Love, ſays he has neither Wiſdom enough to ſpeak, nor to hold his Tongue. If this be a juſt Deſcription, the Sincerity of my Paſſion will admit of no Diſpute: And whenever, in your Company, I behave like a Fool, forget not that you are anſwerable for my Incapacity. Having made bold to declare thus much, I muſt preſume to ſay, that a favourable Reception of this will, I am certain, make me more worthy your Notice; but your Diſdain would be what I believe myſelf incapable ever to ſurmount. To try by idle Fallacies, and airy Compliments, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on your Judgment, is a Folly for any Man to attempt who knows you. No, Madam, your good Senſe and Endowments have raiſed you far above the Neceſſity of practiſing the mean Artifices which prevail upon the leſs deſerving of your Sex: You are not to be ſo lightly deceived; and if you were, give me leave to ſay, I ſhould not think you

The firſt time the <hi>honeſt Man</hi> came to ſee me, in the way you was pleaſed to put into his Head, was one <hi>Sunday</hi> after Sermon time: He began with telling me, what I found at <hi>my</hi> Fingers-ends; that it was very cold, and politely blow'd upon <hi>his.</hi> I immediately perceived, that his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me could not keep him warm; and in Complaiſance to your Recommendation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the Fire-ſide. After he had pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well rubbed Heat into his Hands, he ſtood up with his Back to the Fire, and with his Hand behind him, held up his Coat, that he might be warm all over; and looking about him, aſked with the Tranquillity of a Man a Twelve-month mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and juſt come off a Journey, How all Friends did in the Country? I ſaid, I hoped, very well; but would be glad to warm my Fingers. Cry Mercy, Madam!—And then he ſhuffled a little further from the Fire, and after two or three Hems, and a long Pauſe—</p>
                  <p>I have heard, ſaid he, a moſt excellent Sermon juſt now: Dr. <hi>Thomas</hi> is a fine Man truly: Did you ever hear him, Madam? No, Sir, I gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally go to my own Pariſh-Church. That's right, Madam, to be ſure: What was your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to-day? The <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi> Sir. A very good one truly; Dr. <hi>Thomas</hi> would have made fine Work upon that Subject. His Text to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was, <hi>Evil Communications corrupt good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> A good Subject, Sir; I doubt not the Doctor made a fine Diſcourſe upon it. <hi>O, ay,</hi> Madam, he can't make a bad one upon any Subject. I rung for the Tea-kettle; for, thought I, we ſhall have all the Heads of the Sermon immediately.</p>
                  <p>At Tea he gave me an Account of all the religious Societies, unaſk'd; and how many Boys they had put out 'Prentice, and Girls they had taught to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0866800400:133"/>
knit and ſing Pſalms. To all which I gave a Nod of Approbation, and was juſt able to ſay, (for I began to be horribly in the Vapours) It was a very excellent Charity. <hi>O, ay,</hi> Madam, ſaid he again, (for that's his Word, I find) a very excellent one truly; it is ſnatching ſo many Brands out of the Fire. You are a Contributor, Sir, I doubt not. <hi>O, ay,</hi> Madam, to be ſure; every <hi>good Man</hi> would contribute to ſuch a worthy Charity, to be ſure. No doubt, Sir, a Bleſſing attends upon all who promote ſo worthy a Deſign. <hi>O, ay,</hi> Madam, no doubt, as you ſay, I am ſure I have ſound it; bleſſed be God! And then he twang'd his Noſe, and lifted up his Eyes, as if in an Ejaculation.</p>
                  <p>O, my good Aunt, what a Man is here for a Huſband! At laſt came the happy Moment of his taking Leave; for I would not aſk him to ſtay Supper: and moreover, he talk'd of going to a Lecture at St. <hi>Helen's;</hi> and then (tho' I had had an Opportunity of ſaying little more than Yes, and No, all the Time; for he took the Vapours he had put me into, for Devotion and Gravity at leaſt, I believe) he preſs'd my Hand look'd frightfully kind, and gave me to underſtand as a Mark of his Favour, that if, upon further Converſation, and Inquiry into my Character, he ſhould happen to like me as well as he did from my Behaviour and Perſon; why, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IAM ſorry you think Mr. <hi>Leadbeater</hi> ſo unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Lover. He is a ſerious, ſober, good Man; and ſurely when Seriouſneſs and Sobriety make a neceſſary Part of the Duty of a <hi>good Huſband,</hi> a <hi>good Father,</hi> and <hi>good Maſter</hi> of a Family; thoſe Characters ſhould not be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Ridicule, in Perſons of <hi>our Sex</hi> eſpecially, who would reap the greateſt Advantage from them. But he talks of the <hi>Weather</hi> when he firſt ſees you, it ſeems; and would you have him directly fall upon the Subject of <hi>Love,</hi> the Moment he beheld you?</p>
                  <p>He viſited you juſt after Sermon, on a <hi>Sunday:</hi> And was it ſo unſuitable for him to let you ſee, that the Duty of the Day had made proper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon him?</p>
                  <p>His Turn for promoting the Religious Societies which you ſpeak ſo ſlightly of, deſerves more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard from every good Perſon; for that ſame Turn is a kind of <hi>Security</hi> to a Woman, that he who had a benevolent and religious Heart, could not make a <hi>bad Man,</hi> or a <hi>bad Huſband.</hi> To put out poor Boys to 'Prentice, to teach Girls to ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> would be with very few a Subject for Ridicule; for he that was ſo willing to provide for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0866800400:135"/>
the Children of <hi>others,</hi> would take ſtill greater Care of <hi>his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gave you to underſtand, that if he liked your Character on Inquiry, as well as your Perſon and Behaviour, he ſhould think himſelf very happy in ſuch a Wife; for that, I dare ſay, was more like his Language, than that you put in his Mouth: And, let me tell you, it would have been a much ſtranger Speech, had ſo cautious and ſerious a Man ſaid, without a thorough Knowledge of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that at the firſt Sight he was over Head and Ears in Love with you.</p>
                  <p>I think, allowing for the ridiculous Turn your airy Wit gives to this his firſt Viſit, that, by your own Account, he acted like a prudent, a ſerious, and a worthy Man, as he is, and as one that thought flaſhy Compliments beneath him, in ſo ſerious an Affair as this.</p>
                  <p>I think, Couſin <hi>Jenny,</hi> this is not only a mighty ſafe Way, as you call it, of travelling toward the <hi>Land of Matrimony,</hi> but to the <hi>Land of Happineſs,</hi> with reſpect as well to the <hi>next World</hi> as <hi>this.</hi> And it is to be hoped, that the <hi>better Entertainment</hi> you ſo much wiſh for, on your <hi>Journey,</hi> may not lead you too much out of <hi>your Way,</hi> and divert your Mind from the principal View which you ought to have to your <hi>Journey's End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I could rather have wiſh'd, that you could bring your Mind nearer to <hi>his</hi> Standard, than that he ſhould bring down his to your <hi>Level.</hi> And you'd have found more Satisfaction in it than you imagine, could you have brought yourſelf to a little more of that <hi>ſolemn Appearance,</hi> which you treat ſo lightly, and which, I think, in <hi>him,</hi> is much more than <hi>mere Appearance.</hi>

                  <p>BY the Letter I juſt now received from you, I fanſy you have been a little too haſty, as well at too free, in your Conjectures about my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I hope it is ſuch, and will be always ſuch, as ſhall juſtify me to Perſons of Honour of my own Sex, as well as yours. You have ſurely, Sir, a Right to act as you pleaſe; and (at preſent, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) ſo have I.

                  <p>For Goodneſs ſake, Sir, let me do as <hi>I</hi> think proper: I ſee, <hi>you</hi> will. I ſent not for you, nor aſked you to be one of the Number you mention. And, if you think fit to withdraw your Name from the Liſt, can I help it, if I would ever ſo fain? But could you not do this without reſolving to affront me, and to reflect on my Conduct? I am unworthy of your Addreſs. I grant it—Then you can forbear it. Perhaps I like to ſee the young Fellows <hi>dying</hi> for me; but ſince they can do it without impairing their Health, don't be ſo very angry at me. In ſhort, Sir, you are your own Maſter; and, Heaven be thank'd, I am, at preſent, my own Miſtreſs; and your well-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd Letter will make me reſolve to be ſo longer than perhaps I had otherwiſe reſolved.

But indeed, Madam, you treated me, I thought, too lightly; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is intolerable where a Mind is ſo ſincerely devoted. I never ſaw a Lady I could love before I ſaw you. I never ſhall ſee another I wiſh to be mine; and as I muſt love you whether I will or no, I hope you'll forgive my fooliſh Petulance. I am ſure it was inſpired by Motives, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever culpable in their Effects, are intitled to your Forgiveneſs, as to the Cauſe. I cannot meanly ſue, tho' to you. Don't let me undergo too heavy a Penance for my Raſhneſs. You can mould me to any Form you pleaſe.

Such Tempers, Madam, are not the worſt, let me tell you. And tho' I may be too ready to offend, yet am I always as ready to repent.

                  <p>I Cannot help anſwering your Letter, becauſe you ſeem ſenſible of your Fault. If your Temper is ſo captious, your Guard againſt it ſhould be the ſtronger. It is no very comfortable View, let me tell you, that one ſees a Perſon who wants to recommend himſelf to one's Friendſhip, ſo ready to take Fire. What has a Woman to do in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcretion, but to avoid, while ſhe can, a Proſpect ſo unpleaſing? For if ſhe knows ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear diſreputable Imputations, as indeed ſhe ought not, and that the Gentleman is not able to contain himſelf whenever he is pleaſed to be moved, from giving them; why this, truly, affords a moſt comfortable Appearance of a happy Life! However, Sir, I cannot bear Malice for a firſt Fault, tho' yet it looks like a Temper, even in a Friend, that one would rather fear than love. But if it be never repeated, at leaſt till I give ſuch Reaſons for it, that neither Charity, nor a profeſſed Eſteem, can excuſe, I ſhall hope, that what has happen'd may rather be of good than bad Uſe to us both.

                  </opener>
                  <p>MY Niece deſires me to acquaint you, that ſhe received your celeſtial Epiſtle laſt Night, as we were all ſitting down to Supper; and ſhe leaves it to me to anſwer it, according to the Effects it has produced. You muſt know then, that as ſoon as ſhe had read it, there appear'd a more marvellous Metamorphoſis in her Deportment, than any we read of in <hi>Ovid.</hi> She put on high Airs, and talk'd in a lofty Strain to Us, as well as to the Maids; nor knew ſhe how to behave all the reſt of the Evening.—You had ſo thoroughly proved her ſuperior to all the Deities of the Antients, that ſhe could not help fanſying the homely Viands that ſtood before her, a Banquet of <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> and when ſhe put to her Lips ſome of our common Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink, it became immediately, in her Fancy, <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia;</hi> and ſhe affected to ſip, rather than drink. When, by your generous Aid, ſhe had thus raiſed herſelf far above Mortality, ſhe began to deſpiſe our Company, and thought her Grandmother and me too highly favoured by her Preſence; and ſpoke to us in ſuch a Tone, as made us honeſt Mortals amaz'd at her ſudden Elevation.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Sir, as ſhe has placed ſuch a thorough Confidence in you, as to believe whatever you are pleaſed to tell her, ſhe begs you will never ſo far mortify her towering Ambition, as to treat her like any thing earthly.</p>
                  <p>If then you would make yourſelf worthy of her Favour, you muſt, in order to ſupport the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription

you have given of her, at leaſt dart through the Clouds, or riſe with the Morning-Goddeſs, and attend, in her airy Chariot, at her Chamber-window, where, you ſay, all the Graces wait; ſo that you will not be diſpleaſed with your Company.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſhe is under a Concern, which you muſt ſupply, for what Kind of Birds you will find to draw her Chariot; for Doves and Peacocks ſhe would ſcorn to borrow of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> whom you make ſo much her Inferiors.</p>

                  <p>THE Improvement that is viſible in your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince your going to <hi>Bury,</hi> gives me much Pleaſure; and the dawning of fine Senſe, and a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0866800400:142"/>
good Judgment, that diſcovers itſelf in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, makes me hope to ſee every Perfection of my Siſter, your late excellent Mother, revived in you.</p>
                  <p>Yet one thing the Duty of a tender Uncle obliges me to blame in you; and that is, a certain Affectation that of late obtains in your Behaviour, of imitating the Manners of the other Sex, and appearing more maſculine than either the amiable Softneſs of your Perſon or Sex can juſtify.</p>
                  <p>I have been particularly offended, let me tell you, my Dear, at your <hi>new Riding-habit;</hi> which is made ſo extravagantly in the Mode, that one cannot eaſily diſtinguiſh your Sex by it. For you neither look like a <hi>modeſt Girl</hi> in it, nor an <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Boy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Conformity to the Faſhion is allowable. But a cock'd Hat, a lac'd Jacket, a Fop's Peruke, what ſtrange Metamorphoſes do they make! And then the <hi>Air</hi> aſſumed with them, ſo <hi>pert,</hi> and ſo <hi>inſipid,</hi> at the ſame time, makes, upon the whole, ſuch a <hi>Boy-girl</hi> Figure, that I know of nothing that would become either the <hi>Air,</hi> or the <hi>Dreſs,</hi> but a young <hi>Italian</hi> Singer. For ſuch an one, being neither <hi>Man</hi> nor <hi>Woman,</hi> would poſſibly be beſt diſtinguiſhed by this Hermaphrodite Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I would have you remember, my Dear, that as ſure as any thing intrepid, free, and in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Degree bold, becomes a Man; ſo whatever is ſoft, tender, and modeſt, renders your Sex amiable. In this one Inſtance we do not prefer our own Likeneſs; and the leſs you reſemble us, the more you are ſure to charm: For a <hi>maſculine Woman</hi> is a Character as little creditable as becoming.</p>
                  <p>I am no Enemy to a proper Preſence of Mind in Company; but would never have you appear
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0866800400:143"/>
bold, talkative, or aſſured. Modeſty in the outward Behaviour, is a ſtrong Prepoſſeſſion in a Lady's Favour; and, without it, all your Perfections will be of little Service, either as to Reputation or Preferment. You want not Senſe: and, I hope, will take kindly theſe well-intended Hints from</p>

                     <salute>Dear <hi>Polly,</hi>
                     </salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE three ſeveral Propoſals made me on your Account; and they are ſo particularly circumſtanced, that I cannot approve of one of them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is by Mr. <hi>Aldridge,</hi> for his Son <hi>John,</hi> who, you know, is very weak in his Intellects, and ſo apt to be miſled, that he wants a <hi>Guardian</hi> for him in a <hi>Wife,</hi> and ſo does you the Reputation to think you a proper Perſon for that Office. But I think, the worſt Weakneſs in the World in a Huſband is, that of <hi>Intellect;</hi> and I ſhould ſuffer much to have you linked to a Man who has no <hi>Head,</hi> and is, for that Reaſon, highly unworthy to be yours. A <hi>fooliſh Wife</hi> is much more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe ſhe can be <hi>kept up;</hi> but a <hi>fooliſh Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> will do what he pleaſes, and go where he pleaſes; and tho' he knew nothing elſe, will think he knows too much to be controuled by his Wife; and will have <hi>this</hi> Leſſon taught him by Rakes and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0866800400:144"/>
Libertines, when he is capable of <hi>no other.</hi> So I did not think it neceſſary ſo much as to conſult you about him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is from Mr. <hi>Gough,</hi> for his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who has run thro' ſuch a Courſe of Libertiniſm, that he has hardly his Fellow, and has neither a <hi>ſound Head,</hi> nor a <hi>ſound Body;</hi> and is ſo far from being reclaim'd, that his Father propoſes a Wife, as the <hi>laſt Hope,</hi> for him; and yet knows not whether he will accept of one, if one can be found that would venture upon him. So I could not think of ſuffering my Daughter to ſtand either to the Courteſy, or lie at the Mercy, of ſo profligate a Rake: tho', it ſeems, he <hi>vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes</hi> to <hi>like</hi> you better, as his Father ſays, than any one he ever ſaw; which was the Reaſon of the old Man's Application to me.</p>
                  <p>The third was from Mr. <hi>Tomkins,</hi> whoſe Nephew is as bad a <hi>Sot,</hi> as the other is a <hi>Rake;</hi> but who promiſes to reform, if his Uncle can procure my Conſent and yours. But as you had refuſed his Overtures when made to <hi>yourſelf,</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting me, and for the very Reaſons <hi>I</hi> ſhould have rejected him, I would not trouble you about him; but gave a total Denial to the Requeſt of his Uncle, who deſired that the Matter might be brought on again, by my Authority and Interpoſition.</p>
                  <p>So, my good Girl has had hard Fortune, as one may ſay, in the Offers of three Perſons, that it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould chuſe out of: One ſo very a <hi>Fool,</hi> a ſecond ſo profligate a <hi>Rake,</hi> and the third ſo vile a <hi>Sot,</hi> that there could be no Thought of any of the Three.</p>
                  <p>But I have a <hi>fourth</hi> Affair to mention to you, againſt which there can lie but one Objection; and that is, ſome Diſparity in Years. This is my good Friend Mr. <hi>Rowe;</hi> as honeſt a Man as ever
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0866800400:145"/>
liv'd; a Man of Prudence; a Man of good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and eaſy Circumſtance; Maſter of a genteel Houſe and Buſineſs; well reſpected by all the World, and <hi>moſt</hi> by thoſe who know him <hi>beſt;</hi> a good-natur'd Man, humane, compaſſionate, and, tho' <hi>frugal,</hi> not a <hi>Niggard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, my dear Daughter, What think you of Mr. <hi>Rowe?</hi>—He has an high Opinion of your Prudence and Diſcretion; but wiſhes <hi>himſelf,</hi> that <hi>you</hi> were either Ten Years older, or <hi>he</hi> Ten Years younger.—Yet he thinks, if you can get over that Point, he could make you one of the fondeſt of Huſbands, and that there is not any thing but he could and would oblige you in.</p>
                  <p>I too, my Dear, wiſh there was a nearer Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Years;</hi> yet, conſidering the Hazards a young Woman runs, as the World goes, from <hi>Rakes, Sots,</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> of every Degree; conſidering that in this Matter, there is but <hi>one</hi> only thing to be wiſh'd for; and that all the <hi>grand Deſirables</hi> of Life will be ſo <hi>well</hi> ſupply'd; conſidering too that he is a <hi>ſightly,</hi> a <hi>neat,</hi> a <hi>perſonable</hi> Man, and has good <hi>Health,</hi> good <hi>Spirits,</hi> and good <hi>Humour,</hi> and is not yet got quite at the Top of the <hi>Hill of Life.</hi> Conſidering all theſe Things, I ſay, I think that <hi>one</hi> Conſideration might be given up for the <hi>many</hi> other <hi>more</hi> material ones, which would be ſo well ſupply'd in this Match.</p>
                  <p>Say, my dear Daughter, ſay freely, what you think. You'll much oblige me, if you can get this Matter over. But if you cannot, (and be ſo happy as I wiſh you)—why then—I don't know what to ſay—But I muſt—I think—acquieſce. But yet, I could once more wiſh—But I will ſay no more till I have your Anſwer, but that I am</p>

                  <p>His <hi>advanced Years,</hi> give me leave to ſay, will be far from being agreeable to <hi>me;</hi> and will not my <hi>Youth,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Effects</hi> of it, in ſome Particulars, be diſtaſteful to <hi>him?</hi> Will not that <hi>innocent Levity,</hi> which is almoſt inſeparable from my Time of Life, appear to him in a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſable Light, than perhaps it deſerves? For, Sir, is not a Likeneſs of Years attended with a Likeneſs of Manners, a Likeneſs of Humours, an Agreement in Diverſions and Pleaſures, and Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too? And can ſuch Likeneſſes, ſuch Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be naturally expected, where the Years on one Side <hi>double</hi> the Number of the other? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Sir, is not this Defect, if I may ſo call it, a Defect that will be far from mending by Time?</p>
                  <p>Your great Goodneſs, and the Tenderneſs I have always experienc'd from you, have embolden'd me to ſpeak thus freely upon a Concern that is of the higheſt Importance to my future Welfare,

which I know you have in View from more ſolid Motives than I am capable of entertaining.

                  <p>I AM far from taking amiſs what you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in Anſwer to my Recommendation of my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Rowe;</hi> and I am ſure, if I was to ſhew him your Letter, he would never permit you to be urged more on this Head. But, my Dear, I own my Wiſhes and my Heart are engaged in <hi>his,</hi> ſhall I ſay, or in <hi>your own</hi> Favour? And I would hope, that notwithſtanding all you have written, your good Senſe, and that Diſcretion for which you have been hitherto ſo deſervedly noted, may, on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reflection, enable you to overcome the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that would be inſuperable to lighter and airier Minds of your Sex.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0866800400:148"/>
Such is the Profligateneſs of the Generality of young Fellows of the preſent Age, that I own I look into the World with Affrightment, at the Riſques which a virtuous young Woman has to encounter with on a Change of Condition, which makes me dwell upon the Point with the greater Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And you know, my Dear, I can have no Motive but your Good.</p>
                  <p>Then, Child, conſider the Reputation this Match, to all who know Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi>'s Worth, will bring to your <hi>Prudence,</hi> and even to your <hi>Sex.</hi> For it is as much Credit to a <hi>young Lady</hi> to marry a worthy Man, <hi>older than herſelf,</hi> as it is <hi>Diſcredit</hi> for an <hi>old Woman</hi> to marry a young Man. Does my <hi>Polly</hi> take my Meaning? The Caſe is plain. Beſides, no-body thinks Ten or Twelve Years Difference in a Man's Age any thing out of the way. So, my Dear, it is not <hi>Twenty</hi> Years Odds; it is only <hi>Ten</hi> at <hi>moſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, again, he is a good-natur'd Man; there's a great deal in <hi>that,</hi> you know.</p>
                  <p>To be ſure, my Dear, it is my good Opinion of your <hi>Prudence,</hi> that makes me endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you to this. And I could be glad, methinks, to find, that I have not too high a Notion of <hi>your</hi> Diſcretion, in the Preference I am willing to give it to that of all the young Ladies I know.</p>
                  <p>But if I am miſtaken, I mean, if you cannot get over this <hi>one</hi> Difficulty, I ſhall be apt to think, ſo ſurmountable does it ſeem to me, that you have ſeen ſomebody you like, and are prepoſſeſs'd. Yet I cannot believe that neither, becauſe you know I have ſo tender a Regard for your own Option, that you would have made me acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>Yet, after all, far be it from me to compel your Inclinations! But if you ſhould be ſo happy as to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0866800400:149"/>
think with me, that the many valuable Qualitics Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> is poſſeſſed of, are ſcarcely to be hoped for in a younger Man, as the World now goes, you would make me very happy; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you will never repent your Choice.</p>
                  <p>One thing more let me urge, my Dear; for you ſee how my Heart's upon it. How many very virtuous young Maidens have married, for the ſake of <hi>Riches</hi> only, a Man much older, much more diſagreeable, waſpiſh, humourſome, diſeaſed, decrepit, and yet have lived Years without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and made themſelves not unhappy! And will not my dear Daughter do as much to <hi>oblige her Father,</hi> (and where Health, Good-nature, Wiſdom, Diſcretion, and great Circumſtances meet to <hi>enforce</hi> the Argument) as others would do, where not one of theſe Advantages are in the Caſe, except the ſingle Article of <hi>Riches?</hi> Only then, my Dear, let Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> attend you, two or three times, before you abſolutely ſet yourſelf againſt him. And, as I hope your Affections are intirely diſengaged, you will ſoon ſee whether his Converſation or Propoſals will not incline you in his Favour, conſidering all things; that is to ſay, conſidering the <hi>one</hi> thing AGAINST him, and the <hi>many</hi> FOR him. And if it cannot be, I will intirely acquieſce, being ever ſtudious of your Happineſs, as becomes</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is with ſome Reluctance, and great Reſpect, that I prevail on myſelf to give you this Trouble. The frequent Viſits Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> makes you, and the Airs that Gentleman gives himſelf, have given Birth to a Report, that a Treaty of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you is on foot; and that, in all Probability, it will be ſoon brought to Effect.</p>
                  <p>To be ſure, Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> is not to be blam'd, to endeavour to procure for his Wife a Lady of your Prudence, good Character, and Fortune; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will be able to avoid the Cenſure of the World, if you chuſe <hi>him</hi> for a Huſband, is another Point, which greatly concerns you to conſider of, and affects me, and all who wiſh you well.</p>
                  <p>His Fortune, Madam, is not equal to yours, ſuppoſing it to be better than the World reports it: He has Children: So have you. What Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may not ariſe from hence? Eſpecially, as he is not thought to be one of the beſt and ſmootheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd Men in the World.—His Character is not equal in any reſpect, to ſay the leaſt, (for I would not detract from any Man's Merit) to that of your late good Spouſe, my dear Friend; who would have been much grieved, if he had had but the leaſt Apprehenſion, that the Man he would not have accompany'd with, ſhould ſucceed him in his Bed.</p>
                  <p>Far be it from me, dear Madam, if you are ſo diſpoſed, as to wiſh to hinder you from a Change
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0866800400:151"/>
of Condition with a ſuitable Perſon! But as your late Spouſe left <hi>his</hi> and <hi>your</hi> Children ſo much in your Power, methinks you ſhould take eſpecial Care, how and to whom you communicate any Part of that Power, and thereby give a <hi>Right</hi> to controul not only <hi>them,</hi> but yourſelf. Muſt <hi>he</hi> not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to <hi>his own</hi> Children? And will he not expect, that your Complaiſance to him ſhould make <hi>you</hi> ſo too; or, at leaſt, be his Childrens Behaviour what it will, that it ſhall induce you to put them upon a <hi>Par</hi> with your own? His Daughters will be Spies upon your Conduct, and, be you ever ſo kind to them, will always ſuſpect your Partiality to your own, and treat you as their <hi>Mother-in-law;</hi> and their Father will believe all they ſhall ſuggeſt, for <hi>that</hi> very Reaſon, and becauſe he will <hi>judge,</hi> tho' perhaps not <hi>allow for,</hi> that you <hi>ought</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>your own</hi> to <hi>his:</hi> And this will be the Source of perpetual Uneaſineſſes between you. Conſider, dear Madam, whether your late affectionate Spouſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from you, that <hi>his</hi> Children and <hi>your own</hi> ſhould be put upon ſuch Difficulties, in Favour of thoſe of <hi>any other</hi> Perſon whatever.</p>
                  <p>No doubt but you may make your own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Mr. <hi>Clarkſon.</hi> He will be glad to call you and your Fortune <hi>his,</hi> upon any Terms: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Madam, how difficult it may be, whatever Articles you make, for a good Wife, who has been accuſtom'd to think <hi>her</hi> Intereſt the <hi>ſame</hi> with that of her <hi>Huſband,</hi> to refuſe to his <hi>Importunities,</hi> and perhaps to his <hi>Conveniency,</hi> if not <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> thoſe Communications of Fortune which you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in your own Power, when they will make him <hi>eaſier</hi> in Circumſtance, and <hi>more complaiſant</hi> in Temper: And how hard it will be to deny a Man <hi>any thing,</hi> to whom you have given your <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and to whom you have vowed <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0866800400:152"/>
But if you ſhould have the Reſolution to <hi>refuſe</hi> him, what he may not be backward to <hi>aſk,</hi> do you think yourſelf ſo well able to bear that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,</hi> if not <hi>worſe,</hi> which ſuch a Refuſal may occaſion? And would you chuſe to have Advantage taken of your <hi>tendereſt Hours,</hi> either to induce you to acquieſce with Importunities, which, comply'd with, may hurt your <hi>Children;</hi> or, to have thoſe tender Moments daſh'd with Suſpicions of <hi>Selfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Deſign;</hi> for Prudence will oblige you to be on your Guard, that even the <hi>higheſt Acts</hi> of <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrongeſt Profeſſions</hi> of <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> may not be preparative Arts to obtain from you Conceſſions you <hi>ought</hi> not to make. And how will the pure Joys which flow from an <hi>unſuſpected</hi> Union of Minds and Intereſts, the Want whereof will make <hi>any</hi> Matrimony unhappy, be found in a State thus circumſtantiated?</p>
                  <p>If, Madam, you are bent upon a Change of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, your Friends would wiſh firſt, that you will be pleaſed abſolutely to aſcertain the Fortunes of your Children, according to the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of their <hi>dear Father,</hi> as far as may <hi>legally</hi> be done, either by chuſing Truſtees for them, or by ſuch other way as ſhall put it out of a <hi>new</hi> Huſband's Power to hurt them: And when he ſhall know this <hi>is done,</hi> you will have a better Teſtimony of his Affection, as he will know what <hi>is,</hi> and what <hi>is not</hi> yours, and can hope for no more, becauſe it is not in your Power to give more. But how much more is it to be wiſhed, for your own ſake, as well as your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens, that if you do change, it may be with a Perſon who has <hi>no</hi> Children? And then what <hi>other</hi> Children may be the Reſults of your <hi>new Marriage,</hi> they will be <hi>your own</hi> as well as <hi>his,</hi> and ſo be <hi>more properly</hi> intitled to your <hi>Care</hi> and your <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> than any Man's Children by <hi>another Wife</hi> can be.</p>

By this means, Madam, moſt of the Uneaſineſſes we every Day ſee in Families, where are <hi>two Sorts</hi> of Children, will be prevented; or perhaps your preſent Children will be grown up, and out of the way, before the other can <hi>interfere</hi> eſſentially with them; or if <hi>not,</hi> they will be <hi>naturalized,</hi> as one may ſay, to <hi>each other;</hi> and having the <hi>ſame</hi> Mother, who has an <hi>equal</hi> Intereſt in them <hi>all,</hi> will <hi>expect</hi> and <hi>allow for</hi> an <hi>equal</hi> Exertion of Tenderneſs and Favour to <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>

               <hi>Inſtructions to young Orphan Ladies, as well as others, how to judge of Propoſals of Marriage made to them without their Guardians or Friends Conſent, by their Milaners, Mantua-makers, or other Go-betweens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A YOUNG Orphan Lady, of an independent Fortune, receivable at Age, or Day of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, will hardly ſail of ſeveral Attempts to engage her Affections. And the following general Rules and Inſtructions will be of Uſe to her on theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0866800400:154"/>
In the firſt place, ſhe ought to miſtruſt all thoſe who ſhall ſeek to ſet her againſt her Guardian, or thoſe Relations to whom her Fortune or Perſon is intruſted: And, next, to be apprehenſive of all ſuch as privately want to be introduced to her, and who avoid treating with her Guardian firſt for his Conſent. For ſhe may be aſſur'd, that if a young Man has Propoſals to make, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thinks would be accepted by a Perſon of <hi>Years</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> he will apply in a regular way to her Friends; but if he has not, he will hope to engage the young Lady's Affections by the means of her <hi>Milaner,</hi> her <hi>Mantua-maker,</hi> or her <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and ſo by Bribes and Promiſes endeavour to make his way to her Favour, in order to take Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her Youth and Inexperience: For this is the conſtant Method of <hi>Fortune-hunters,</hi> to which many a worthy young Lady of good Senſe and good Fortune has owed her utter Ruin.</p>
            <p>The following are generally the Methods taken by this Set of Deſigners:</p>
            <p>Theſe induſtrious Go-betweens, who hope to make a Market of a young Lady's Affections, generally by Letter, or Word of Mouth, if they have Opportunity, ſet forth to the young Lady:</p>

And very probably, the young Lady, having no bad Opinion of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and loving to be admired, believes it very eaſily."</q>

                  <p>I AM at my Wits end almoſt on what you write. But if I <hi>am</hi> to be ruined, with my nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family, and a poor induſtrious, but <hi>ailing</hi> Wife, how can I help it? For I cannot poſſibly raiſe 20 <hi>l.</hi> any manner of way by the Time you mention. I hope Sir <hi>John</hi> won't be ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted. For if God Almighty, our <hi>common</hi> Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, ſhould be <hi>equally</hi> hard upon us, what would become of us <hi>all?</hi> Forgive my Boldneſs to talk of God Almighty to his <hi>Honour,</hi> in this free manner.</p>
                  <p>I would do it, if it was to be done; but you know, Sir, what a <hi>Seaſon</hi> we have had. And an honeſter Tenant his Honour will never have, that I am ſure of. But if Money <hi>won't</hi> riſe, what can I <hi>do?</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0866800400:165"/>
Should I ſell my Team, and my Utenſils for Labour, there is an End of <hi>all.</hi> I ſhall have no Means left me then wherewith to pay his <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>any body</hi> elſe. If his Honour will not be moved, but <hi>will</hi> ſeize, pray, good Mr. <hi>Taverner,</hi> prevail on him not to throw me into Gaol, for a Priſon pays no Debts; but let my poor Wife and Six ſmall Children lie in the Barn, till I can get a little Day-labour; for that muſt be all I can have to truſt to, if his Honour ſeizes. I hear my Man <hi>William</hi> that was, has juſt taken a Farm; may be, he will employ his poor ruin'd Maſter, if I am not <hi>priſon'd.</hi> But if I be, why then the Pariſh muſt do ſomething for my poor Children, tho' I hoped they would never trouble it.

                  <p>I AM exceedingly concerned to hear, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of your Creditors has laid you under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. But there is one Comfort reſults from it, that the utmoſt Stretch of their Revenge cannot carry them farther; and that when a Man is got to the undermoſt Part of Fortune's Wheel, he <hi>may</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0866800400:169"/>
riſe, but <hi>cannot</hi> ſink lower. You now know the worſt, and have nothing to do, but to ſupport your Misfortune with that true Magnanimity which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a noble Mind. Long, very long, have you been labouring under great Difficulties, and ſo have been enured to Misfortunes; and you have <hi>looked forward</hi> with ſuch Anxiety and Pain to the hard Lot that has now befallen you, that 'tis impoſſible the <hi>bearing</hi> of it can be equal to the <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> you had of it. You ſee all around you too many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Objects reduced to the ſame Diſtreſs, and you ſee them either extricating themſelves from thoſe Difficulties, (as I hope you ſoon will) or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bear them with a true Chriſtian Reſignation. For well does the wiſe Man obſerve, that <hi>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong, nor Riches to a Man of Underſtanding.</hi> And it will yield you ſome Conſolation when you reflect, that <hi>this</hi> Life is but a State of <hi>Probation,</hi> and he that meets with Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes <hi>here,</hi> may, by a <hi>proper Uſe</hi> of them, and by <hi>God's Grace,</hi> be intitled to a bleſſed Hope; when a <hi>proſperous State</hi> may make a Man forgetful of his Duty, and ſo reap no other Good but what he finds in this <hi>tranſitory</hi> Life.

                  <p>I NOW experience fully the Truth of the honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phraſe, That <hi>a Friend in Need, is a Friend in Deed.</hi> You have filled me with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort to find that I am not abandoned by <hi>all</hi> my old Acquaintance, that, in a great meaſure, your ſeaſonable Kindneſs will enable me to purſue the Advice you give me.</p>
                  <p>It is too late to look back now on the Steps that have brought me to this abject Condition. No doubt, were I to live my Life over again, I could do much better for myſelf than I have done, and ſhould hardly run into ſome of the Failings that have help'd to bring ſuch heavy Misfortunes upon me. But my Comfort is, I ever had an <hi>honeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> and never was a <hi>Sot</hi> or a <hi>Spendthriſt.</hi> But yet, who knows, if I had avoided <hi>ſome</hi> Miſtakes, that I might not have fallen into <hi>as bad</hi> another way? So I muſt acquieſce in the Diſpenſation, and pray to God, in his own good Time, to deliver me from it.</p>
                  <p>What is moſt grievous to me in this Matter, is my <hi>poor Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> who have deſerved a happier Fate; had it been in my Power to have done better for them, than now I am ever likely to do.</p>
                  <p>As to your kind Offer, my dear Friend, I will beg to ſee you as often as may not be detrimental to <hi>your own</hi> Affairs. I care not how ſeldom I ſee my dear Wife: Neither <hi>her</hi> Heart nor <hi>mine</hi> can bear the Grief that oppreſſes us when we think of our <hi>happier</hi> Days and Proſpects, and ſee them all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0866800400:171"/>
                     <hi>concluded</hi> within theſe <hi>Bars,</hi> and <hi>Bolts,</hi> and <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices;</hi> ſo that we ſink one another ſtill lower every doleful Viſit the dear good Woman makes me. But <hi>your</hi> Viſits, my Friend, will be of ſingular Uſe and Comfort to <hi>me,</hi> (as your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and kind Advice will be to <hi>her,</hi> as often as you can) to ſave us both the Mortification of ſeeing one another ſo often as my Affairs will otherwiſe require her to come to this diſmal Place; for I cannot open my Mind to any body but you and her. I will alſo get you to go to Mr. <hi>Maddox,</hi> my principal Creditor, and one or two more; I will tell you about what; and only fear I ſhall be too troubleſome to you. But you are ſo kind as to offer your Service in this way, and I am reduced to the ſad Neceſſity of puſhing myſelf upon you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Hope of ever having it in my Power to ſhew you, as I wiſh to do, how much I am</p>

                  <p>I Think it a long Time ſince I have had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Satisfaction of hearing of your Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Often and often do I reflect on the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of us poor Women, who are marry'd to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring Men. Every <hi>Wind</hi> that blows, every <hi>Pirate</hi> we hear of, and now, in <hi>Time of War,</hi> every Hour of our Lives, the Dread of <hi>Enemies,</hi> alarms us. God's Providence is our Reliance, and ſo it ought; for nothing elſe can ſuſtain us thro' our different Apprehenſions every Day we live. But to be ſure the Unhappineſs is ſtill greater to

ſuch as love one another, as we always did. I hope, when it ſhall pleaſe God to return you ſafe to my Wiſhes, that you will take no more of theſe very long Voyages, if you can help it. The Trips to <hi>Hotland</hi> or <hi>France</hi> are ſo pretty, that they rather add to than diminiſh one's Comforts: But, Oh, theſe long, long Voyages! Yet, in Time of War, People cannot do as they will. And I muſt be contented; and the more, when I ſee that the fine Ladies of Captains, Commodores, and Admirals, are no better off than your poor <hi>Jenny</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have had the Misfortune to loſe Uncle <hi>James</hi> ſince you went: He was a <hi>Landman,</hi> out of the Dangers <hi>you</hi> run; yet, as I hope, God has preſerved <hi>you,</hi> while <hi>he</hi> is dead and <hi>gone.</hi> So we ſee there is nothing to be ſaid for it, when our Time is come.

Fie upon her, I ſay, tho' ſhe is my Aunt! for ſhe had a good Huſband of him. As to you and I, my Dear, I hope God will ſpare us to one another; for you are my <hi>Firſt</hi> Love, and ſhall be my <hi>Laſt.</hi> Couſin <hi>Barns</hi> had the Misfortune to break his Leg, but is in a good way. <hi>Jenny Adams</hi> is to be marry'd next Week to <hi>John Laſcells.</hi> This is all the News among our Acquaintance; for I am ſure it is none, to tell you, that I am</p>

                  <head>LETTER CXXX. To a Father, on his Neglect of his Childrens Education.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM under a Concern to ſee ſuch a Remiſſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as every body takes notice of, in the Education of your Children. They are brought up, 'tis true, to little Offices in your Buſineſs, which keep them active, and may make them in ſome degree of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> tho' <hi>poor</hi> Uſe to <hi>you;</hi> but, I am ſorry to ſay, of <hi>none</hi> to <hi>themſelves,</hi> with regard to their <hi>future Proſpects,</hi> which is what a worthy Parent always has in View.</p>
                  <p>There is a proper Time for every thing; and Children are not early initiated into their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                        <desc>••…</desc>
                     </gap>, and thoſe Parts of Learning which are proper to their particular Years, they muſt neceſſarily be diſcouraged, and ſet behind every one of their School fellows, tho' much younger than themſelves; and you know not, Sir, what a laudable Emulation you by this means deſtroy, than which nothing is of greater Force to Children, to induce them to attend to their Book; nor what a Diſgrace you involve them in with reſpect to Children among Children, for the Biggeſt and Eldeſt to be ſo much out-done by the Leaſt and Youngeſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the Conſequence of this Defect confin'd to the School-age, as I may call it; for as they grow up, they will be look'd upon in an equally diſcouraging and diſadvantageous Light, by all who converſe with them: Which muſt of courſe throw them into the Company of the Dregs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for how will they be able to converſe or correſpond with thoſe whoſe Acquaintance it is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0866800400:186"/>
moſt worth their while to cultivate? And indeed they will probably be ſo conſcious of their Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bear a Part in worthy Converſation, that, to keep themſelves in Countenance, they will, of their own Accord, ſhun the <hi>better</hi> Company, and aſſociate with the <hi>worſt:</hi> And what <hi>may</hi> be the Conſequence of this, a wiſe Man, and a good Father, would tremble to think of, eſpecially when he has to reflect upon himſelf as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, let it be what it will.</p>
                  <p>Then, Sir, it is to be conſider'd, that without a tolerable Education, they can be only fit for mean and ſordid Employments. Hear what the Wiſe Man ſays to this very Purpoſe: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How can he get Wiſdom, that holdeth the <hi>Plough,</hi> and that glorieth in the <hi>Goad,</hi> that driveth <hi>Oxen,</hi> and is <hi>occupied</hi> in their Labours, and whoſe Talk is of <hi>Bullocks?</hi> He giveth his Mind to make <hi>Furrows,</hi> and is diligent to give the <hi>Kine Fodder.</hi> So every <hi>Carpenter</hi> and <hi>Workmaſter</hi> that labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Night and Day—The <hi>Smith</hi> alſo ſitting by the Anvil, and conſidering the Iron-work, the Vapour of the Fire waſteth his Fleſh—The <hi>Noiſe</hi> of the <hi>Hammer</hi> and the <hi>Anvil</hi> is ever in his Ears—So doth the <hi>Potter</hi> ſitting at his Work, and turning the Wheel about with his Feet—He faſhioneth the Clay with his Arm, and boweth down his Strength before his Feet."</q> Theſe, as he obſerves, are uſeful in their Way; but their Minds being <hi>wholly</hi> engroſſed by their Labours, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"they ſhall not be ſought for in <hi>publick Council,</hi> nor ſit <hi>high</hi> in the <hi>Congregation</hi>—they cannot declare <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and they ſhall not be found where <hi>Parables</hi> are ſpoken."</q> That is, they ſhall be confined to the Drudgery of their own <hi>ſervile Station,</hi> and will be intitled neither to <hi>Honour</hi> nor <hi>Reſpect,</hi> as they might
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0866800400:187"/>
have been, had they had an Education to qualify them for more reſpectable Buſineſſes. And you will conſider, Sir, in a cloſer Light, as to us who live in the <hi>preſent Age,</hi> and in this <hi>great City,</hi> that there is hardly a <hi>creditable</hi> or <hi>profitable</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in <hi>London,</hi> where a tolerable Knowledge of <hi>Accounts,</hi> and <hi>Penmanſhip,</hi> in particular, is not required. Conſider alſo what Opportunities they may loſe by this Neglect of their Education, in caſe they ſhould fail in the Buſineſs they are put to, of getting comfortable and genteel Bread in ſome Merchant's Compting-houſe, or in ſome one of the ſeveral Offices about this great Metropolis; as <hi>Book-keepers, Clerks, Accomptants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And with regard more immediately to <hi>yourſelf,</hi> how can you expect, when they know you could do better for them, but that their Behaviour to <hi>you</hi> will be of a Piece with the reſt? for if they are not poliſh'd by Learning, but are left to a kind of <hi>Inſtinct</hi> rather, is it to be expected, that they ſhould behave to <hi>you,</hi> and their <hi>Mother,</hi> with that Senſe of their Obligations which Learning incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates? Nor indeed will they <hi>have</hi> thoſe Obligations to you, which other Children have to <hi>their</hi> Parents, who take care to give them Opportunities of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, which are deny'd to yours. Conſider, dear Sir, what a contemptible Character, even among the ſordid Vulgar, that of an <hi>illiterate Fellow</hi> is; and what Reſpect, on the contrary, a <hi>Man of Letters</hi> is treated with, by his <hi>Equals,</hi> as well as <hi>Inferiors:</hi> And when you lay all theſe plain Reaſons and Obſervations together, I make no doubt but you will endeavour to retrieve loſt Time, and be adviſed in this material Point (which I can have no Intereſt in) by</p>

                  <head>LETTER CXXXI. From a young Maiden, abandon'd by her Lover for the ſake of a greater Fortune.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Mr. <hi>John,</hi>
                     </salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I MUST take up my Pen and write, tho' perhaps you will only ſcoff at me for ſo doing; but when I have ſaid what I have to ſay, then I ſhall have eaſed my Mind, and will endeavour to forget you for ever. I have had ſo many Cautions given me againſt the falſe Hearts of Men, and was ſo often told how they will vow and forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that I ought to have been on my Guard, that's true: And indeed, ſo <hi>I was</hi> a great while: You know it well. But you courted me ſo long, vowed ſo earneſtly, and ſeem'd ſo much in Love with me, that it was firſt <hi>Pity</hi> in me, that made me liſten to you; and, Oh! this <hi>naſty Pity,</hi> how ſoon did it bring—But I won't ſay <hi>Love</hi> neither. I thought, if all the young Men in the World beſides proved falſe, yet it was impoſſible <hi>you</hi> ſhould. Ah! poor ſilly Creature that I was, to think, tho' every body flatter'd me with being ſightly enough, I could hold a Heart ſo ſordidly bent on <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as I always ſaw <hi>yours</hi> to be; but that, thought I, tho' 'tis a Meanneſs <hi>I don't like,</hi> yet will it be a Security of his making a frugal Huſband in an Age ſo fruitful of <hi>Spendthrifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But at length it has proved, that you can prefer <hi>Polly Bambridge,</hi> and leave <hi>poor me,</hi> only becauſe ſhe has a greater Portion than I have.</p>
                  <p>I ſay nothing againſt <hi>Polly.</hi> I wiſh <hi>her</hi> well. Indeed I do. And I wiſh <hi>you</hi> no Harm neither. But as you knew <hi>Polly before,</hi> why could you not have made to yourſelf a Merit with <hi>her,</hi> without
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0866800400:189"/>
going ſo far with <hi>me?</hi> What need you have ſo often begg'd and pray'd, ſigh'd and vow'd, (never leaving me, Day nor Night) till you had got me fooliſhly to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> you? And ſo, after your Courtſhip to me was made a <hi>Town-talk,</hi> then you could leave me to be laugh'd at by <hi>every one I ſlighted for you!</hi> Was this juſt, was this well done, think you?</p>
                  <p>Here I cannot go out of Doors but I have ſome one or other <hi>ſimpering</hi> and <hi>ſneering</hi> at me; and I have had two <hi>Willow-garlands</hi> ſent me; ſo I have—But what poor Stuff, in ſome of my <hi>own Sex</hi> too, is this, to laugh at and deride <hi>me</hi> for <hi>your</hi> Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? I can call my Heart to witneſs to my Virtue in Thought, in Word, and in Deed; and muſt I be ridicul'd for a <hi>falſe one,</hi> who gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Airs at <hi>my</hi> Expence, and at the Expence of his own Truth and Honour? Indeed you cannot ſay the leaſt Ill of me, that's my Comfort. I defy the World to ſay any thing to blaſt my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: Why then ſhould I ſuffer in the <hi>World's Eye,</hi> for <hi>your</hi> Baſeneſs?—</p>
                  <p>I ſeek not to move you to return to the Fidelity you have vow'd; for by this Time, may hap, you'd be as baſe to <hi>Polly</hi> as you have been to <hi>me,</hi> if you did; and I wiſh <hi>her</hi> no <hi>Willow-garlands,</hi> I'll aſſure you. But yet, let me deſire you to ſpeak of me with Decency: That is no more than I deſerve, well you know. Don't, to brave-thro' the Perfidy you have been guilty of, mention me with ſuch Fleers, as, I hear, you have done to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and pray call me none of <hi>your poor dear Girls!</hi> And, <hi>I hope ſhe won't take it to Heart, poor Thing!</hi>—with that Inſolence that ſo little becomes you, and I have ſo little deſerved. I thought to have appeal'd to your <hi>Conſcience,</hi> on what has paſſed between us, when I began. I thought to have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0866800400:190"/>
put the Matter <hi>home</hi> to you! But I have run out into this Length, and now don't think it <hi>worth while</hi> to write much more: For what is <hi>Conſcience</hi> to a Man who could <hi>vow</hi> as you have done, and <hi>act</hi> as you have done?</p>
                  <p>Go then, Mr. <hi>John,</hi> naughty Man as you are! I will try to forget you for ever. Rejoice in the Smiles of your <hi>Polly Bambridge,</hi> and glad your Heart with the Poſſeſſion of an Hundred or Two of Pounds more than I have; and ſee what you'll be the <hi>richer</hi> or <hi>happier</hi> a <hi>few Years</hi> hence. I wiſh no Harm to you. Your <hi>Conſcience</hi> will be a greater Trouble to you than I wiſh it to be, if you are capable of <hi>reflecting.</hi> And for <hi>your ſake,</hi> I will henceforth ſet myſelf up to be an Adviſer to all my Sex, never to give Ear to a <hi>Man,</hi> unleſs they can be ſure, that his <hi>Intereſt</hi> will be a <hi>Security</hi> for his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Affection</hi> to them.

                  <p>YOU have often importuned me to return Marks of that Conſideration for <hi>you,</hi> which you profeſs for <hi>me.</hi> As my Parents, to whom I owe all Duty, encourage your Addreſs, I wiſh I could. I am hardly treated by them, becauſe I cannot. What ſhall I do? Let me apply to you, Sir, for my
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0866800400:192"/>
Relief, who have much good Senſe, and, I hope, Generoſity. Yes, Sir, let me beſpeak your <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> to yourſelf, in this Point; and that ſhall be all I will aſk in my Favour. I own you deſerve a much better Wife than I ſhall ever make; but yet, as Love is not in one's own Power, if I have the Misfortune to know I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love you, will not <hi>Juſtice</hi> to yourſelf, if not <hi>Pity</hi> to me, oblige you to abandon your preſent Purpoſe?</p>
                  <p>But as to myſelf, Sir, Why ſhould you make a poor Creature unhappy in the Diſpleaſure of all her Friends at preſent, and ſtill more unhappy, if, to avoid that, ſhe gives up her <hi>Perſon,</hi> where ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beſtow her <hi>Heart?</hi> If you love me, as you profeſs, let me aſk you, Sir, Is it for <hi>my ſake,</hi> or is it for <hi>your own?</hi>—If for <hi>mine,</hi> how can it be, when I muſt be miſerable, if I am forced to marry where I cannot love?—If for <hi>your own,</hi> reflect, Sir, on the Selfiſhneſs of your Love, and judge if it deſerves from me the Return you wiſh.</p>
                  <p>How ſadly does this Love <hi>already</hi> operate! You love me ſo <hi>well,</hi> that you make me miſerable in the Anger of my deareſt Friends!—Your Love has already made them think me undutiful, and inſtead of the Fondneſs and Endearment I uſed to be treated with by them, I meet with nothing but Chidings, Frowns, Slights, and Diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And what is this Love of yours to do for me hereafter?—Why hereafter, Sir, it will be turned to <hi>Hatred,</hi> or <hi>Indifference</hi> at leaſt: For then, tho' I cannot give you my <hi>Heart,</hi> I ſhall have given you a <hi>Title</hi> to it, and you will have a lawful Claim to its Allegiance. May it not then, nay <hi>ought</hi> it not to be treated on the Foot of a Rebel, and expect Puniſhment as ſuch, inſtead of Tenderneſs? Even were I to be treated with <hi>Mercy,</hi> with <hi>Goodneſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0866800400:193"/>
with <hi>Kindneſs</hi> by you, and could not <hi>deſerve</hi> or <hi>return</hi> it, what a Wretch would your <hi>Love</hi> make me! How would it involve me in the crying Sin of <hi>Ingratitude!</hi> How would it deſtroy my <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in the <hi>World's Eye,</hi> that the <hi>beſt</hi> of Huſbands had the <hi>worſt</hi> of Wives!—The <hi>kindeſt</hi> of Men, the <hi>unkindeſt</hi> of Women!—</p>
                  <p>Ceaſe then, I beſeech you, this hopeleſs, this cruel Purſuit!—Make ſome <hi>worthier</hi> Perſon happy with your Addreſſes, that <hi>can</hi> be happy in them!—By this means, you will reſtore me (if you decline as of your <hi>own</hi> Motion) to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you found me in, the Love of my Parents, and the Eſteem of my Friends. If you <hi>really</hi> love me, this may be a hard Taſk; but it will be a moſt generous one—And there is ſome Reaſon to expect it; for who, that <hi>truly</hi> loves, wiſhes to make the Object of his Love miſerable? This muſt I be, if you perſiſt in your Addreſs; and I ſhall know by your Conduct on Occaſion of this <hi>uncommon</hi> Requeſt, how to conſider it, and in what Light to place you, either as the moſt <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous</hi> or the moſt <hi>ungenerous</hi> of Men.

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AFTER many unaccountable Heſitations, and concealed Meanings, that your Mind ſeem'd of late big with, but hardly knew how to expreſs, you have, at laſt, ſpoken out all your Mind; and I know what I am to truſt to! I have that Diſdain of your Propoſal that an honeſt Mind ought to have. But I wiſh, for my own ſake, (and I will ſay, for <hi>yours</hi> too, becauſe your Honour is concerned in it ſo deeply) that I had had, at my firſt Acquaintance with you, ſuch an Inſtance of your <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> or rather <hi>Baſeneſs:</hi> Then I ſhould have had no Regret in letting you know how much I ſcorn'd the <hi>Propoſer,</hi> and the <hi>Propoſal:</hi> Tho' I hope, as it is, a little Time and Reflection will make me, for the ſake of the <hi>latter,</hi> abhor the <hi>former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, Sir, I muſt ſay, you are very cruel to uſe me thus, after you had, by all the alluring Profeſſions of an honourable Love, inſpired me with a grateful Return, and brought me to the Freedom of owning it—Nor yet will I be an Hypocrite, or deny my honeſt Paſſion; for that would be to leſſen your Guilt. God is my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I loved you beyond all your Sex; yet I loved you <hi>virtuouſly;</hi> I loved you becauſe I thought you <hi>virtuous.</hi> And now, tho' it may take ſome Time, and too much Regret, to get over, yet do I hope, your Behaviour will enable me to conquer my fond Folly.</p>

Ungenerous Man! to take Advantage of your ſuperior Fortune to inſult me thus, when you had gain'd my Affections! What, tho' I am not bleſſed with a worldly Circumſtance equal to what you might expect in a <hi>Wife,</hi> can you think my Mind ſo baſe as to ſubmit to be yours on unworthy Terms? Go, unworthy Man, and make your Court to Miſs <hi>Reynolds,</hi> as you ſeem to threaten. She has a Fortune equal to your own, and may you be happy together! I ſhould have been ſo, had I never known you. I never deceived you: You knew my ſcanty Fortune, and yet pretended to prefer me to all my Sex.</p>
                  <p>On me you might have laid the higheſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by raiſing me to a Condition I was humble enough to think above me; and I ſhould have been, on that account, all Gratitude, all Duty, all Acknowledgment. On Miſs <hi>Reynolds</hi> you will confer none; her Fortune will quit Scores with yours, and you muſt both, in your Union, be Strangers to the inexpreſſible Pleaſure of <hi>receiving</hi> or <hi>conferring</hi> of Benefits: But this is a Pleaſure which none but generous Minds can taſte: That yours is not ſo, witneſs your deteſted Propoſal, after ſuch ſolemn Profeſſions of faithful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Love. And I have one Conſolation, tho' a Conſolation I did not wiſh for, that I am under no Obligation, but the contrary, to ſuch a Man. And am as much your Superior, as the Perſon who would do no Wrong, is to one that will do nothing elſe. Send me, however, my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I may be aſſured my fond Credulity will not be the Subject of freſh Inſult, and that perhaps to the <hi>Perſon</hi> that ſhall be what you made <hi>me</hi> expect <hi>I</hi> ſhould be.

For when once a Perſon has ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what belongs to himſelf, or his Character, as to make ſuch an Attempt, the very Continuance with him, and in his Power, and under the ſame Roof, is an Encouragement to him to proſecute his Deſigns. And if he carries it better, and more civil, at preſent, it is only the more certainly to undo you when he attacks you next. Conſider, my dear Child, your Reputation is all you have to truſt to. And if you have not already, which God forbid! yielded to him, leave it not to the Hazard of another Temptation; but come away directly (as you ought to have done on your own Motion) at the Command of</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU are pleaſed to inform me of your Thoughts in relation to a Change of your Condition, and to command me to give you freely my Opinion of the Conveniencies and Inconveniencies, that may follow from the Inequality of Years between you, and the young Lady you think of making your ſecond Wife. Indeed, I am ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for your Happineſs, that had I heard of ſuch your Intention, and had not your Commands to be free on this Head, I think I ſhould have run
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0866800400:200"/>
the Riſque of being thought impertinent and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, rather than not have expoſtulated with you on this Occaſion. My Objections, Sir, are not ſo much to the Gaiety of the Lady, as to her Youth, and the Children you have already by your late excellent Lady: And when you remember, that Miſs <hi>Fanny,</hi> your eldeſt Daughter, is near as old as the Lady you think to make her Mother, I beg, Sir, you will conſider how your Reputation, as to Prudence, will ſuffer in the Eye of the World <hi>without you,</hi> as well as the Look it will have to your <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Domeſticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nature, Juſtice, Decency, and every Branch of human Prudence, plead ſtrongly againſt the Union of lively Youth with maturer Years. <hi>Her</hi> Temper may be very agreeable: So indeed is <hi>yours</hi>—But may they be ſo to <hi>each other,</hi> when they meet together in ſo cloſe an Union? You are <hi>yet</hi> bleſt with a good State of <hi>Health;</hi> but can you expect, that it will be <hi>always</hi> ſo?—Or rather, will not <hi>every Year</hi> take from <hi>your</hi> Conſtitution, what it will add to <hi>hers,</hi> for ſeveral Years to come? Your Years make <hi>you</hi> ſerious and ſolemn, and you are paſt a <hi>Reliſh</hi> for thoſe Pleaſures and Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are but ſuitable to <hi>hers,</hi> and which at the <hi>ſame Age</hi> you yourſelf delighted in. Can you recall <hi>Time paſt?</hi> Will it <hi>become</hi> you to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume</hi> the Part which <hi>Judgment</hi> has made you quit? How aukwardly, if you attempt it, will you do this! What Cenſure will <hi>this</hi> ſubject you to? How will it embolden the gay young Fellows to make Attempts, that may, notwithſtanding the moſt unexceptionable Conduct in the <hi>Lady,</hi> give <hi>you</hi> great Uneaſineſs?</p>
                  <p>If you cannot join in the <hi>innocent Gaieties</hi> which you have long <hi>diſuſed,</hi> it would be, in ſome meaſure, cruel, to <hi>deprive</hi> a young Lady of her Share of them,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0866800400:201"/>
at an Age that will naturally make her <hi>expect</hi> and <hi>require</hi> them: And yet will not even <hi>innocent</hi> Liberties be Matter of Reproach to <hi>her,</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs to <hi>you,</hi> if ſhe takes them without you? And would you chuſe to bear her Company, and indulge a <hi>young-old</hi> Taſte, for gay Scenes long contemn'd, and ſo appear in a Light, to all that beheld you together, either as her <hi>Father,</hi> or her <hi>jealous Keeper,</hi> and make it look to the World as if you <hi>yourſelf</hi> doubted her Virtue out of your own <hi>Preſence?</hi> Suppoſe the Scene at a gallant Comedy, that ſprightly free Joke which will make <hi>her</hi> ſmile, will make <hi>you</hi> frown; and ſo on in every other Scene of Life and Amuſement between you. For a <hi>Defect</hi> or <hi>Inequality</hi> of whatever Kind, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man is <hi>conſcious</hi> of it, let him <hi>carry it off as he may,</hi> will always be <hi>preſent</hi> with him, and, like another Conſcience, ſtare him in the Face.</p>
                  <p>Your Fortune, 'tis true, is ſo conſiderable, that you may amply provide for <hi>all</hi> your Children, and yet make it worth a young Lady's while, who would ſtudy her <hi>Intereſt,</hi> preferably to any <hi>other</hi> Conſideration, to oblige you: But, Sir, let me aſk you, Can you, who lived ſo happily with your <hi>late dear Lady,</hi> and had ſuch conſtant Proofs of her <hi>inviolable</hi> Affection to your Perſon, content yourſelf with a <hi>counterfeit</hi> Paſſion, a mere <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Affection in a <hi>Wife?</hi> And can you think, that ſo <hi>young</hi> a Lady can love you, like <hi>her</hi> who grew on in Life, in Hope, in Deſires <hi>with you;</hi> and who, from a reciprocal Youth paſſed agreeably together, grew <hi>equally</hi> mature, and had <hi>both</hi> but <hi>one</hi> View between you; to wit, a young Family growing up, the <hi>common</hi> Offspring of your <hi>mutual</hi> Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and who were the <hi>binding,</hi> and, ſo long as her Life laſted, the <hi>indiſſoluble</hi> Cement of your <hi>Loves</hi> and your <hi>Intereſts?</hi>—If ſhe <hi>can,</hi> ſhe will be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0866800400:202"/>
a Contradiction to all <hi>Experience,</hi> and you will be happy againſt all reaſonable <hi>Expectation</hi>—If ſhe <hi>cannot,</hi> will you be content with a <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Civility,</hi> inſtead of <hi>true Love;</hi> and which cannot poſſibly ſo much as look <hi>like</hi> Love, but by the Diſſimulation and Hypocriſy of your <hi>Boſom Companion?</hi>—</p>
                  <p>When I look back on what I have written, I begin to be afraid of your Diſpleaſure on a double Account; for the <hi>Nature,</hi> and for the <hi>Length</hi> of this Epiſtle, tho' you have commanded me to ſpeak my Mind. Yet having ſeveral other material Points to touch upon, and relying upon your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for my good Intentions, (for what View can I have in the Liberty I take, but your Happineſs?)

                  <p>I WILL now take the Liberty to continue my Subject, and my humble Expoſtulations upon it: And I will ſuppoſe two Caſes very, if not equally probable; to wit, that you <hi>may,</hi> or may <hi>not,</hi> have Children by your new Lady; and to judge in both Caſes, how the Happineſs of your remaining Life may be affected by either. In the firſt place, if you ſhould have Children by her, (to ſay nothing of the Miſunderſtandings and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0866800400:203"/>
this may create between your Lady, and your preſent Children, which may greatly affect your own Happineſs) are you ſo well able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, at <hi>theſe</hi> Years, with Credit and Satisfaction, that Character which ſo peculiarly befits a <hi>young</hi> Huſband to a <hi>young</hi> Wife? And will it not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtrike you, that your own Children by <hi>that</hi> time will make a <hi>better</hi> Figure in ſuch a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than yourſelf? Will you be ſo well able to go thro' the <hi>ſame</hi> Troubles, the <hi>ſame</hi> Anxieties, the <hi>ſame</hi> Hopes, Fears, and Affections, both to the pregnant Mother, and afterwards to the Infant Progeny, that you have ſo <hi>happily</hi> got over? And will not what was then called <hi>laudable Love,</hi> be now deemed <hi>Dotage</hi> and <hi>Uxoriouſneſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Providence ſeems to have deſign'd the <hi>youthful</hi> Portion of a Man's Life, for mutual Endearments, and Propagation of his Family; the <hi>maturer</hi> Part, for Education, Counſel or Advice. And will you, Sir, <hi>invert</hi> the Deſign of it? Will you <hi>call back</hi> the Days of <hi>Senſe,</hi> into the Years of <hi>Intellect;</hi> watch over the Baby in the <hi>Cradle,</hi> when you ſhould form the Mind of the <hi>grown Perſon?</hi>—How unequal will you be to this Part, to what you <hi>once</hi> were?—As you will not have the <hi>ſame</hi> Diſpoſitions about you, you cannot have the <hi>ſame</hi> Joy at a pleaſing Incident; but will have poſſibly a <hi>ſuperadded</hi> Weight of Sorrow on any ſad Event, as <hi>Years</hi> will have <hi>added</hi> to your <hi>Reflection,</hi> as <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> will have <hi>contracted</hi> your <hi>Hope,</hi> and as you will have <hi>ſeen</hi> the Vanity of all worldly Expectations.</p>
                  <p>Then, my dear Sir, conſider, if you ſhould even get over this <hi>reſumed</hi> Province happily, and have no material Uneaſineſs from the Lady, on the Account I have intimated to you: Is it not too probable, that you may not live to ſee this young Race brought up? And if you ſhould, what Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0866800400:204"/>
what Uneaſineſſes may not enſue, from the different Intereſts into which your Family will be divided? And it may, moreover, be poſſible for you to have Grandchildren older than ſome of your own by your new Lady.</p>
                  <p>But if we ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Occaſion</hi> for this may not happen, will the Matter be mended by it?—All young Ladies expect and wiſh for Children, when they marry. If ſhe ſhould not have any, ſhe will hardly be induced to think it <hi>her</hi> Fault; but the <hi>Difference</hi> of Years will <hi>tell</hi> her, and all the World will <hi>join</hi> in it, <hi>where</hi> to lay the Blame, <hi>deſerved</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> She will, for want of ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> an Employment, look <hi>abroad</hi> for Amuſements and Diverſions, which, however innocent in her firſt Intentions, may not <hi>always</hi> end ſo; and if they <hi>do,</hi> will be very unſuitable to your Diſpoſition and Liking. Childbed <hi>matronizes</hi> the giddieſt Spirits, and brings them to Reflection ſooner than any other Event. Its Conſequences fill up the Time, and introduce different Scenes of Pleaſure and Amuſement in the Mind of a Lady. It draws her Attention to more <hi>ſerious</hi> Affairs, it <hi>domeſticates</hi> her, as I may ſay, and makes her aſſociate with graver Perſons, and ſuch as are in the ſame Scenes of Life. But where this is <hi>not,</hi> ſhe <hi>continues</hi> her youthful and giddy Acquaintance, <hi>claſſes</hi> herſelf as to her <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Diverſions,</hi> as if in the <hi>ſingle</hi> State ſtill, and looks for Amuſements <hi>out of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>out of your Houſe:</hi> And you will be obliged to connive at a good deal more than you otherwiſe would, becauſe the Difference of Years will give as much <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> as it will <hi>Preſumption</hi> to <hi>her;</hi> and if there be any Grievance between you, ſhe'll think, after all you can do, it is of <hi>her</hi> Side.

Then another Inconvenience may ariſe: The Lady, if ſhe has no Children by you, to prevent lying at the <hi>Mercy of yours,</hi> as ſhe will call it, will be making a <hi>ſeparate</hi> Intereſt to herſelf: She will grow upon your Indulgence and Fondneſs; ſhe will <hi>cajole,</hi> ſhe will <hi>reproach,</hi> ſhe will <hi>tieze</hi> you into Acts of Bounty and Profuſion to her. She will endeavour to build up a Fortune out of yours, to the Prejudice of <hi>your Family.</hi> And all this for what End?—Only to make her a <hi>rich Widow,</hi> and to give her Opportunity to triumph, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction perhaps with ſome <hi>young Rake</hi> or <hi>Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> over <hi>your Aſhes,</hi> and to make Compariſons <hi>grievous to Reflection,</hi> at the Expence of your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Memory, in the <hi>new</hi> Man's Favour.</p>

                  <head>LETTER CXLII. Againſt a Second Marriage, where there are Children on <hi>both</hi> Sides.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU aſk my Opinion as to the Thoughts you have entertained of making your Addreſſes to the Widow <hi>Lockyer.</hi> Do you really aſk it with an Intent to take it? Or, like the Generality of the World, only in hopes that my Judgment falling in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0866800400:206"/>
with your own, may be a kind of Juſtification or Excuſe for what you intend to do, and are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, already reſolved upon? If ſo, what do you do, but lay a Snare for me, which may put an End to our Friendſhip? For Men leaſt of all bear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul or Contradiction in Points of this Nature, when their Hearts are actually determined; and then Indifference begins, and Diſguſt ends the beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemented Friendſhips.</p>
                  <p>To ſay the Truth, I never was a Friend to Second Marriages, where there are Children on one Side, and a Likelihood of more; but, eſpecially, where there are Children on <hi>both.</hi> I have nothing to ſay, as to the Perſon or Character of the Lady. You, whom it moſt concerns, are well ſatisfy'd of both, or you would not have gone ſo far, as to aſk a Friend's Advice on this Occaſion: But ſince you do put it to me, I will throw a few Reaſons together, which have always had Weight with me on theſe Occaſions; and I hope, you'll not think the worſe of your Friend, if he happen to differ a little from your own Judgment.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, in the Caſe you put, That the Circumſtances on both Sides, are pretty equal. That there is no great Diſparity in Years. That ſhe has Three Children, and you have Four; a round Family, however, when they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! That ſhe is very fond of her Children, and you, at <hi>preſent,</hi> of yours. That you are not an ill-temper'd Man, and ſhe is a good-temper'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and was a loving Wife to her late Spouſe, as you were an affectionate Huſband to yours. Well, ſo far is very well, and, you'll think perhaps, very promiſing of a happy Union; and poſſibly you may think right; at leaſt you have much better Grounds for it, than many that do marry upon much worſe and more unequal Proſpects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0866800400:207"/>
But conſider, Sir, what Security have you, that Perſons who have been always good-temper'd, when they have nothing to thwart or try their Temper, will be ſtill ſo, when they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will?—Here, at the very Threſhold of this Adventure, is a Cauſe of great Trial; a Trial which neither of you had before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, which neither of you know how you ſhall behave in: She loves <hi>her</hi> Children. So ſhe ought. You love <hi>yours.</hi> It is right ſo to do. But ſee you not, before I ſpeak, that this laudable <hi>ſeparate</hi> Love of <hi>either,</hi> may become matter of great Uneaſineſs to <hi>both?</hi> You cannot, either of you, poſſibly expect more than common Civility, and outſide Kindneſs, from the other, <hi>ſhe</hi> to <hi>yours, you</hi> to <hi>hers.</hi> And it will be happy enough if this Taſk do not ſufficiently try the Diſcretion of <hi>both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible, my Friend, but you muſt have very different Views on each other—A pretty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſet out with in a matrimonial Adventure! Her Praiſes of her own Children will be very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and laviſh. Her Praiſes of yours, if ſhe <hi>ever</hi> praiſes, will be very ſuſpicious and ſparing. And perhaps you muſt be as diſcreet as poſſible, in the Praiſes of your own. The very Cloaths each wear, the Victuals they eat, nay, the very Looks of either Parent, as they ſhall appear kind to their own, or reſerved to the other's, will afford room for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heart-burnings, if not outward Janglings. I have ſeen many Inſtances of theſe kinds.</p>
                  <p>Their different Capacities; one ſhall take their Learning, another not—Their different Tempers; one ſhall be mild, another inſulting: one ſmooth, another rough—Their different Ages; which will make one dictate, while the other will not be preſcribed to—Will all afford Cauſe of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and when they come to an Age fit for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0866800400:208"/>
ſetting them out in the World; if Boys, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice; You put <hi>Jackey</hi> to a better Trade than <hi>Tommy,</hi> and give more Money with him! And yet one Trade or Maſter may apparently deſerve or require it; the other, not. If Girls, in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; Why ſhould <hi>Betſey</hi> be married before <hi>Thomaſine?</hi>—Let the Eldeſt go firſt! Tho' perhaps the one has an humble Servant, the other none—Ay, I ſee poor <hi>Thomaſine</hi> muſt be contented with any body, or any thing, while <hi>Betſey</hi> muſt be a Lady!—Theſe are all ſtill freſh Cauſes of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Uneaſineſs to you both.</p>
                  <p>Then will ſhe actually, or you will ſuſpect it, (and that is as bad to your Peace) be conſtantly <hi>progging,</hi> as the Women call it, for her Children, in order to make a private Purſe for them, on any Occaſion that may happen, or in caſe ſhe ſhall outlive you.</p>
                  <p>And if there be a <hi>third</hi> Race of Children from this Marriage, worſe and worſe ſtill. Then the two former Sets, if they never joined together before, now will make a common Cauſe, in this ſingle Point, againſt the new Race; and muſt not this double your own and your Wife's Comforts, think you?—Then muſt you be glad to leſſen your Family at home, that you may leſſen the Number of ſo many Spies and Enemies to your Repoſe. The Boys muſt be hurry'd out to the firſt Thing that offers for them, whether ſuitable or unſuitable to their Genius or Capacity; and they generally thrive accordingly: The Girls to the firſt Man that will take them, whether he can provide for them or not, as he ought; and after a while they may come back to you, tho' fitted out with a great Expence, quite deſtitute and undone, with a farther Increaſe to your Family; the too frequent Conſequences of precipitate Marriages. And then
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0866800400:209"/>
will a new Scene commence; for all the unprovided-for, will join againſt the poor unhappy one.</p>
                  <p>This, you'll ſay, is looking a great way forward. It is ſo. And what may never happen. Poſſibly it never may, as to the laſt Caſe; but as it too often has happen'd, and daily does happen, a wiſe Man will think a little about it, while it is in his Power to prevent it all.</p>
                  <p>I have touch'd but upon a few of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that may too probably follow from a new Engagement. Yet, I believe, theſe, if you are <hi>not</hi> abſolutely determin'd, will make you think a little; if you <hi>are,</hi> why then, all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that can be urged will ſignify nothing. And in this Caſe, you ſhould not have laid a Snare for me to diſoblige a Perſon who is to ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Friendſhip and mine, and who will look upon me, if ſhe knows my Mind, (as very probably ſhe will; for I hardly ever knew a Secret of this kind kept) as her Enemy, and ſo create a Coolneſs and Indifference between us, which you cannot help if you would. For if ever it be ſo, and your <hi>Lady</hi> receives me, in a way that I have not been uſed to in your <hi>Houſe,</hi> I ſhall be very ſhy of viſiting either you or her.</p>
                  <p>If you require it, and it will have any Effect upon you, I can enter ſtill farther into this Subject; but I fanſy I have ſaid enough, and perhaps more than you'll thank me for. But be that as it will, I have anſwer'd your Requeſt; and ſhewn you, (peradventure, at the Expence of my Diſcretion) that I am, in all Things,</p>

                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU are inclined, you tell me, to give your <hi>Children</hi> a <hi>Mother,</hi> inſtead of the good one they have loſt; or rather, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you ſhould have ſaid, <hi>yourſelf</hi> a <hi>Wife,</hi> to ſupply your <hi>own Loſs:</hi> And you aſk my Opinion on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without naming the Perſon, only intimating, that ſhe is a maiden Lady, no more than Seven Years younger than yourſelf, and has a pretty middling Fortune.</p>
                  <p>I am glad you have not named the Lady; for now I ſhall ſtand clear of any Imputation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Prejudice, let me ſay what I will. I will therefore freely tell you my Mind, that I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways againſt ſecond Marriages, where there are Children on one or both Sides, and likely to be more: Unleſs there are ſuch worldly Reaſons as make it abſolutely prudent for a Perſon to marry to eſtabliſh his Circumſtances. This is not your Caſe: For you are very eaſy in the World; and beſides, the Ladies of this Age are ſo brought up, that a Man muſt not look for very extraordinary Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in a Wife, with relation to her <hi>own</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, much leſs the Children of <hi>another</hi> Woman. Well, but <hi>this</hi> Lady is highly prudent, good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, an excellent Oeconomiſt, and what not! And ſo they are <hi>all,</hi> my Friend; or at leaſt, we are apt to perſuade ourſelves ſo, before they are marry'd.</p>
                  <p>But we'll ſuppoſe her all you ſay, and all you think; yet ſhe will hardly, I preſume, be diveſted
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0866800400:211"/>
of the Paſſions common to human Nature. Can you expect, that tho' you give your Children a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you give them an <hi>own</hi> Mother? She may have Prudence enough to do what <hi>ſhe</hi> will think her Duty by them, but muſt ſhe not be her own Judge, of what that is?—And are you ſure, that what ſhe calls ſo, nay, and, for Peace-ſake, what you will be willing to call ſo too, will be called ſo by your Children, as they grow up, and even by the reſt of the World? But Children, you'll ſay, may be unreaſonable and undutiful—Very well, Sir—we'll ſuppoſe it ſo; but will this make you happy, let them have Reaſon, or not, for their Surmiſes? And as ſhe cannot plead <hi>Nature</hi> for the Regulator of her Conduct towards them, but common Civility, and Prudence only, at the very beſt; will there not be two to one on the Childrens Side, that they may be right? But whoever may be right or wrong, if you are made unhappy by it, that's the eſſential Point to you, who by this ſecond Marriage have been the Cauſe of it all.</p>
                  <p>This is moſt certain, <hi>her</hi> Views muſt be quite contrary to thoſe of your <hi>Children:</hi> 'Tis true, theirs will of Conſequence be likewiſe contrary to hers, and yet both may be very reaſonable too, according to the Character of each. And is not this a pretty Situation for you, do you think? For which Side <hi>can</hi> you, <hi>muſt</hi> you take? The Children, as they grow up, will be jealous of ill Offices from her with you. She will interpret thoſe things which a natural Mother would think nothing of, as ſtudied Slights; and will not their conſtant Bickerings make you uneaſy in your own Family, where Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs is the leaſt tolerable, as it is the Place to which a Man ſhould retire for Comfort, when the World gives him Cauſe of Diſpleaſure?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0866800400:212"/>
And what, pray, may this probably end in? Why, for Quietneſs-ſake, you will poſſibly be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſeparate them. The Mother-in-law, ſhould <hi>ſhe</hi> be in <hi>Fault,</hi> you <hi>cannot</hi> part with. The Children then muſt turn out, of courſe. You muſt ſtudy, after reconciling and patching up a hundred Breaches, to make ſome other Proviſion for <hi>them.</hi> And thus, perhaps, they are precipitated into a wide World, and expoſed to a thouſand dangerous Temptations; and how can you forgive yourſelf, if they ſhould by this means become a Prey to the deſigning Attempts, the <hi>Boys,</hi> of <hi>vicious Women;</hi> the <hi>Girls,</hi> of <hi>profligate Men?</hi> And how would it have grieved the Heart of their indulgent Mother, could ſhe have foreſeen, that her beloved Spouſe, inſtead of ſupplying the Loſs of a <hi>Mother</hi> to them, ſhould take from them his own <hi>immediate</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and that perhaps at a Time of Life, when it was moſt neceſſary for their future Good?</p>
                  <p>This may very probably be more or leſs the Caſe, if there be no other Difficulties, than what may ariſe between your Children and their Mother-in-law. But if, as is moſt likely, you ſhould have Children by this your ſecond Wife, the Caſe may be ſtill worſe. She will then look upon yours by your firſt, not only with a <hi>more indifferent,</hi> but probably with a <hi>jealous</hi> Eye. She will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carking and laying up for her <hi>own,</hi> and grudge every thing you lay out upon the <hi>others.</hi> And when they are both grown up to any Bigneſs, what Claſhings and Jarrings may not enſue between the Offspring of the <hi>ſame</hi> Father, and two <hi>different</hi> Mothers? How will you be obliged to give a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Children of the <hi>latter</hi> Wife, againſt thoſe of the <hi>former;</hi> becauſe the Mother of the one Set is <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> and perhaps <hi>clamorous,</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0866800400:213"/>
in <hi>their</hi> Favour—that of the other, <hi>abſent, ſilent, dead, forgotten!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Love hides a Multitude of Faults, as no doubt it does, and <hi>Indifference,</hi> or, perhaps, as it may be, <hi>Hatred,</hi> is quick-ſighted to every little Slip, how will <hi>hers</hi> be all Angels! <hi>Yours</hi>—the worſt ſhe can call them!—Yet how can you <hi>help</hi> this? You are married to the <hi>Temper,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Woman;</hi> and Oppoſition, 'tis likely, will but make matters worſe; for what the Sex cannot carry by Reaſon or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will by Obſtinacy and Teizing.</p>
                  <p>Then in the Matter of making Proviſion reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively for their future Good, how will your Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes for the <hi>one</hi> be conſtantly leſſened; for the <hi>other</hi> perpetually importun'd? Nor muſt your own Judgment, in <hi>either</hi> Caſe, be ſo much the Rule of your Conduct, as the fond Partiality of your ſecond Wife for hers. And it is far from being impoſſible, that ſhe may uſe your firſt Children <hi>worſe</hi> than ſhe would do <hi>mere Strangers,</hi> for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they have a better Title to your <hi>Regard,</hi> and ſtand <hi>more</hi> in the way of her Intereſt and Views.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, my good Friend, are ſome of the Reaſons I have to alledge againſt ſecond Marriages, where there are Children on one Side, and a Probability of having a ſecond Race. As I hinted, there may be Reaſons, where a Perſon's Circumſtances ſtand in need of the Aſſiſtance that may be procur'd by this means, to overbalance many of the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies I have hinted at. The leſſer Evil in this Caſe is to be choſen, and the Party muſt make the beſt of the reſt.

                  <p>I AM ſorry to hear, that the Difference between you and Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> is at laſt likely to be brought to a Law-ſuit. I wiſh you'd take it into your ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration before you <hi>begin,</hi> becauſe it will hardly be in your Power to <hi>end</hi> it, when you pleaſe. For you immediately put the Matter out of your own Hands, into the Hands of thoſe whoſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> it is to protract the Suit from Term to Term, and who will as abſolutely preſcribe to you in it, as your Phyſician in a dangerous Illneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Law, my good Friend, I look upon, more than any one thing, as the <hi>proper</hi> Puniſhment of an over-haſty and perverſe Spirit, as it is a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that follows an Act of a Man's own ſeeking and chuſing.

I am ſorry for theſe Things, becauſe he has none of the beſt of Characters; having, as I am well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, already ruin'd Two, if not Three, worthy Tradeſmens Daughters: And it is but too probable, that he has no honourable Deſign upon you: For, whatever he may promiſe you, I am credibly aſſur'd, that he is actually engaged with Miſs <hi>Knapper,</hi> whom you know very well: Indeed, it is ſaid, he has 200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> but if it be ſo, he is very much involved in the World; and, at the Rate he lives, had he three times that Eſtate, would never be out of Debt; for he is downright extravagant, a Man of no Conduct, a perfect Rattle, whoſe Words are not to be rely'd on in any reſpect; and makes a common Boaſt of the Favours he has received from our Sex, whoſe faulty Fondneſs is the conſtant Subject of his Ridicule.</p>

                  <p>I AM ſorry with all my Heart, to hear of the frequent Miſunderſtandings between your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and you. I hoped much better things from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0866800400:219"/>
your Prudence. From <hi>my</hi> Prudence, you'll ſay perhaps! as if I thought all the Fault was yours: But, my Dear, I don't think ſo, I can't think ſo; and yet I may find Fault with your want of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence too: For Prudence will oblige a good Wife to bear a little Contradiction from her Huſband, tho' not always juſt, perhaps, as well as to avoid giving Offence. Suppoſe he is peeviſh, petulant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy in his Temper, and on ſlight or no Occaſions, as you may think; muſt <hi>you</hi> be peeviſh and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, becauſe <hi>he</hi> is ſo? How do you know what things may have happened to him abroad, in the way of his Buſineſs, to make him ſo?—Or, if it be <hi>only</hi> Humour, why muſt you be as bad as he that you find Fault with? Is an ill Temper in a Huſband, ſo taking a thing, that the Wife, who finds it intolerable to her, muſt nevertheleſs imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or aſſume it?</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why you will not allow him to be oftener in the Right, and why you condemn as cauſeleſs his Petulance and Waſpiſhneſs, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in a great meaſure from a ſlender Opinion, if not Contempt, of his Judgment. If you think him a Man of Senſe, 'tis impoſſible but you ſhould allow, that there may be ſome Cauſe, tho' you don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately penetrate it, why he ſhould be diſturbed; and it would be kind in you to ſuppoſe the beſt; as, that his Tenderneſs for you will not let him communicate it to you, rather than to imagine he is always in the wrong, and always angry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon. But were it actually to be ſo, are you commiſſioned to puniſh him with Provocations and Reſentments <hi>as</hi> wrong, and even <hi>more</hi> unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in a Wife? If you love him as you ought, you will extenuate his Failings, and draw into an advantageous Light thoſe Actions which may be interpreted in his Favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0866800400:220"/>
But if, as I heard you once ſay, <hi>you will give him as good as he brings;</hi> that <hi>you will not bear his unaccountable Humours,</hi> and ſuch-like vulgar and provoking Expreſſions; it muſt come to this Point: Either <hi>you</hi> or <hi>he</hi> muſt give way; one of your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers muſt be ſubdued, and over-aw'd by the other. If it be <hi>his</hi> Caſe, tir'd out by your reſolute and ſturdy Behaviour, to ſuccumb, do you think this will either be a Credit to <hi>him</hi> or to <hi>you?</hi> What an abject (<hi>henpeck'd,</hi> the Vulgar call it) Wretch will he be deem'd? What a <hi>Termagant</hi> you? He'll be the Jeſt of his Companions, and you be thought to excel—in what? In a Quality the moſt infamous to a Woman, next to that of an Adultereſs.</p>
                  <p>But this I aver, that Meekneſs, Condeſcenſion, Forbearance, are ſo far from being deſpiſable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in our Sex, that they are the <hi>Glory</hi> of it. And what is <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> my Dear, if you are not to be try'd by Provocations? What is <hi>Condeſcenſion,</hi> if you muſt always have your own way? What is <hi>Forbearance,</hi> if you are to return Injury for Injury, with the hoſtile Spirit of a fierce Enemy, rather than to act with the ſweet Complacency of a tender Wife, who has vow'd Obedience and Duty?</p>
                  <p>But, Obedience and Duty, you'll ſay, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for <hi>ill Nature</hi> and <hi>ill Uſage!</hi> Yes, my Dear, even were it to be ſo, you <hi>ought.</hi> For, do you think you are never to condeſcend, or give up your own Humour to your Huſband? A pretty Sort of <hi>Obedience</hi> that, which ſhall be only ſhewn where you are <hi>not</hi> thwarted, but never where you <hi>are!</hi> Would not this be Obedience to your own head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong Paſſions, and not to him?—So long as you can have your way in every thing, you will be a Mirror of Condeſcenſion; but when once you come to be contradicted, why then you are at Liberty to contradict again. If he is out of the way in his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0866800400:221"/>
Humour, you will never be in the way in yours. If he gives you <hi>one</hi> unkind Word, he ſhall have <hi>two</hi> in Return; for <hi>you will give him as good as he brings.</hi> If he is paſſionate, you will be ſo too. You will return provoking Anſwers for reflecting Words; and ſo make your Houſe a conſtant Scene of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and your Life uncomfortable. And for what? Why to ſhew how <hi>bravely</hi> you can return Injury for Injury; how <hi>nobly</hi> you can contend for Victory over your Huſband; and how you can make him deſpiſed in his Family, as well by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as Servants, and yourſelf diſcredited by the poor Victory, ſuppoſe you were to win it by breaking his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Is this, my Dear, the Part of a tender <hi>Wife</hi> to a <hi>Huſband?</hi> Nay, is it the Part of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> where there is <hi>not</hi> the matrimonial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation? For are we not commanded to return <hi>Good for Evil,</hi> and to <hi>pray for them that deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe us?</hi>—And is not the Wife's <hi>Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be coupled with Fear;</hi> and do we not vow <hi>Reverence</hi> to a Huſband as our <hi>Head?</hi>—How can all this be, if you are to return Evil for Evil; to make yourſelf your own Judge, and Jury, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner too, by acquitting yourſelf, condemning him, ſentencing him, and puniſhing him with all the Severity of licentious Speech, provoking Snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhneſs, or the ſtill more affecting Deportment of ſullen contemptuous Silence. Let me, on the Whole, beſeech you, for <hi>my</hi> ſake, who would be loth to be thought to have ſet you any bad Example; for your <hi>Family</hi>'s ſake, for your <hi>Reputation</hi>'s ſake, as well as <hi>his,</hi> to reſolve on a different Conduct. Make the good Rule yours, of never being out of Humour when he is ſo. Firſt ſoften him by good Temper; then, when ſoften'd, expoſtulate mildly on the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of his Anger. If you convince him
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0866800400:222"/>
thus, he will take care of the like Error, or his <hi>preſent</hi> Confeſſion will ſtrengthen your mild Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt him in any thing elſe for the <hi>future.</hi> He will ſee you adviſe him for his Good. He will have a greater Opinion of <hi>your</hi> Prudence, and be more doubtful of <hi>his own.</hi> He will ſee you contend not for Victory, or Contradiction-ſake; but for his own ſake. And depend upon it, you will both reap the happy Fruits of it in the Comfort of your Lives; in the Love of your own Children; in the Reverence of your Servants (who will otherwiſe be liſted in each Contender's Quarrel, and be inſolent Judges of the Conduct of both); in the Reſpect of your Neighbours and Friends; and in the Pleaſure you will give to your Relations, who will viſit and be viſited by you both, with that Delight which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body knows how to eſtimate ſo much, as, my dear <hi>Nanny,</hi>

                     <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WERE I to lay it down for a Maxim, that <hi>Maids</hi> often mend their Circumſtances by Marriage, <hi>Widows</hi> very rarely, I believe I might be juſtify'd by every one's Experience. To what can the Truth of this Obſervation be owing? Is it to be ſuppoſed, that Widows have ſtronger Paſſions than Maids? Shall the proud lordly Sex have it to boaſt, that they are ſuch eſtimable Creatures, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0866800400:223"/>
when once one of them has had the Fortune to be choſen by a Lady, and has been taken from her by Death, ſhe cannot live without taking another, and finds herſelf obliged to accept of the next that offers, thro' all Diſadvantages, and every Degree of Inequality? Surely this cannot be the Caſe! Surely a prudent, a modeſt Lady will not ſay this in <hi>ſo many Words!</hi>—Much leſs then ought ſhe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it by her <hi>Actions,</hi> which are much ſtronger than <hi>Words.</hi> For I believe no Woman who ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Pale of Matrimony with ſprightly Hopes about her, found the Poſſeſſion (<hi>Sex only</hi> conſider'd) equal to her Expectations. The Maid may hope, may fanſy much, in the Commerce between the Sexes, from her meditating on the heighten'd Scenes, which pernicious Novels, and idle Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, the Poiſon of Female Minds, abound with. But the Widow <hi>knows</hi> 'tis all <hi>Free-maſonry,</hi> all empty Hope, flaſhy, fooliſh, unworthy, unperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and, but for the Law of Nature, deſpicable.—Whence is it then, that the <hi>wiſhing,</hi> expecting Maid ſhould be more prudent than the <hi>knowing,</hi> experienced Widow? Should be better Proof, with raiſed Imaginations, againſt Courtſhip or Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than one who well knows the tranſitory Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Unſatisfactorineſs of the End to which that Courtſhip or Perſuaſion tends?</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, That <hi>this</hi> Point is not ſo much the Caſe, as the <hi>ſettled</hi> Life of Matrimony, which has been once ſo ſatisfactorily experienced; let the Circumſtances of a Lady who abounds in every thing, anſwer this poor, but common Excuſe; and let the Choice ſhe makes of the Perſon and Fortune of her ſecond Husband (which is generally, as I have obſerved above, in both Caſes, far ſhort of her former Choice) acquit or convict her, as her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall deſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0866800400:224"/>
If a young Widow indeed advantages <hi>herſelf,</hi> and worſts not her <hi>Children,</hi> (if ſhe has any) in her ſecond Adventure, let her proceed: She is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to worldly Prudence. But this, as I have ſaid, is ſo ſeldom the Caſe, even with Widow Ladies of Modeſty, and <hi>Diſcretion</hi> in other reſpects, that I muſt own I have been often puzzled and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to account for the Motives of ſuch an one, reputably; eſpecially when ſhe appears to me and all the World, neither to have done Honour to the Memory of her late Spouſe, to her Family, to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor, as ſometimes, has been the Caſe, paid any regard to common Decency. How, I ſay, ſhall this be accounted for, in a Lady of Prudence and Virtue? Is it, that, as one Extreme is ſaid to border on another, <hi>extreme Joy</hi> treads on the Heels of <hi>extreme Sorrow?</hi> It cannot be; for as, on one hand, I am ſure there can be no <hi>extreme Joy</hi> in the matrimonial Commerce; ſo, I fear, where a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can ſoon forget her departed Spouſe, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſenſible of <hi>extreme Grief</hi> for his Loſs. And if ſhe will take upon her this latter Part of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and own the firſt was thus indifferent to her, ſhe ſhall have my Conſent to do any thing ſhe has a mind to do, and I will exempt her willingly from the Obſervation of every other Rule of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Decency.</p>
                  <p>But in a Caſe the direct Reverſe of this, how ſhall we account for ſuch a Behaviour? How in particular, if the charming, the blooming Miſs <hi>Bendiſh,</hi> who was ſo coy a Maiden, and with ſo much Difficulty won by the late amiable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible Mr. <hi>Brookes,</hi> with a Fortune ſuperior to her own, ſhould, within a few Months after his Deceaſe, when bleſt with an Affluence left her by his Generoſity and Affection for her, be won by Mr.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0866800400:225"/>
                     <hi>Fownes,</hi> a Man leſs accompliſh'd as to Knowledge, leſs amiable in his Perſon, leſs polite in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and of a Fortune ſo much beneath what was even her maiden one, that her Friends then would never have thought him worthy of her?—How, I ſay, ſhall we account for this, if it ſhould be ſo? Is there a ſecret Sympathy in Tempers and Diſpoſitions, that attracts each its Like by Motives imperceptible and unaccountable? It cannot be in <hi>this</hi> Caſe ſurely. For can the polite Mrs. <hi>Brookes</hi> be <hi>leſs</hi> polite for having been marry'd to one of the beſt-bred and beſt-behav'd Gentlemen in <hi>England?</hi> And can ſhe ſo ſoon get over Forms as a <hi>Widow,</hi> for <hi>ſuch</hi> a Suitor as Mr. <hi>Fownes,</hi> which as a <hi>Maid</hi> were ſo long before they could be diſpenſed with in Favour of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Lover as Mr. <hi>Brookes?</hi>—Is her ſoft and delicate Mind, as well all think it, after <hi>all,</hi> more on a Level with that of the one Gentleman than that of the other <hi>far more</hi> excellent one? Has ſhe, will the Licentious aſk, ſtronger Incentives to a married State, as a Widow, than ſhe had as a Maid?—It cannot be!—What then ſhall we ſay to all this?—For after all, two Years won not Miſs <hi>Bendiſh,</hi> to a Gentleman of exalted Worth; and two Months ſeem to have made a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs with Mrs. <hi>Brookes!</hi>—And that in Favour of a Gentleman, whom we all think unworthy of her at all.</p>
                  <p>My dear Boſom-friend, my School-fellow, my Companion, as well in the <hi>maiden</hi> as in the <hi>matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,</hi> tho', I bleſs God, not in the <hi>vidual</hi> State, reſolve me theſe Queſtions; anſwer to me for this Conduct; account to me for theſe ſeeming unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Motives, and thereby juſtify yourſelf to your <hi>Reputation,</hi> to the <hi>Memory</hi> of the <hi>dear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,</hi> to your <hi>own Sex,</hi> to the <hi>other Sex,</hi> (ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive

                  <p>I AM very ſorry to hear of the Encouragement you give to the Viſits of young Mr. <hi>Barnes,</hi> becauſe of the great Difference in Years between you. I cannot help giving you the Trouble of this Expoſtulation, tho' I am told, (and much affected I am with the News, if it be true) that the Matter between you is ſo far gone, that all I can ſay may too probably prove ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>Our Sex, Madam, in all your late Huſband's Time, has received an Advantage and a Credit from your Conduct in the marry'd State; and now, I wiſh it may not receive as great a Diſparagement, ſince the prudent Mrs. <hi>Bates</hi> thinks fit to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Addreſſes of one who was born after ſhe was marry'd, and a Mother, and who can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have no other Inducement than your Fortune. I believe, Madam, you never knew one happy Marriage of this ſort in all your Life: And you will reflect, that you will not be intitled to Pity, nor the young Man to Cenſure, if he ſhould prove the worſt and moſt profligate of Huſbands to you. For every one will cenſure <hi>you,</hi> and acquit <hi>him,</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0866800400:227"/>
ſhould he even treat you with perſonal Abuſe and Barbarity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is well known, that Mr. <hi>Barnes</hi> is a young Man of no very promiſing Inclinations. Some young Gentlemen are as grave and diſcreet at Twenty-five, as others at Thirty-five: But he has all the Vanity, the Gaiety, the Affectation, of any one at his Time of Life: And can you expect, that he will treat <hi>you</hi> well, that was never noted for treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>own Mother</hi> very dutifully, who, by the way, is <hi>younger</hi> than yourſelf? Advanced Years are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subject of Ridicule with ſuch wild young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, to their Shame be it ſpoken! and what can you expect, when the very Motives by which you ſhall be ſuppoſed to be acted in ſuch a Match, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve you in the deepeſt Cenſure, will make you the Contempt of Perſons of all Ages, and both Sexes, and expoſe you to the low Buffoonery even of the Man you have choſen, who, inſtead of being your Protector, as a Huſband ought to be, will probably be the Perſon who will <hi>lead the Jeſt</hi> that all will join in upon you, in order to excuſe his own ſorbid Choice?</p>
                  <p>You owe it, Madam, give me Leave to ſay, to the <hi>Memory</hi> of your late worthy <hi>Huſband;</hi> you owe it to your <hi>Sex;</hi> you owe it to <hi>yourſelf,</hi> and your <hi>own Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>future Good;</hi> nay, to <hi>Decency,</hi> I will venture to add, to proceed no further in this Affair. It ſeems to me, to be next to a Degree of Inceſt for a Woman all hoary and grey-gooſed over by Time, or who will be ſoon ſo, to expoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Embraces of a young Fellow, who is not ſo old as her firſt Son would have been, had he lived. Forgive me, Madam; but I cannot help this Plain-dealing on the Occaſion. If you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in giving Encouragement to the Boy's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, I expect not, nor can I deſire, to be forgiven,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0866800400:228"/>
or to ſtand upon common Terms with you: If otherwiſe, I am ready to aſk your Pardon; but I cannot with Patience think, that Mrs. <hi>Bates,</hi> who has paſſed thro' every Station <hi>hitherto</hi> with ſo much Applauſe, as well that of the prudent <hi>Widow,</hi> and exemplary <hi>Matron,</hi> as the affectionate <hi>Wife,</hi> ſhould give ſo great a Wound to our Sex as ſhe will do, if ſhe makes ſuch a Boy as Mr. <hi>Barnes</hi> the Succeſſor to her late worthy Huſband, and the Maſter of her Perſon and Fortune: By which Act ſhe will vow Obedience to one who was in a Cradle, when ſhe had Children of her own who were riſing from it; and who would undoubtedly deſpiſe her in this Light, were it not for her Wealth; all of which, that he can get at, by Force, or fair Means, (if he acts by you as others generally have done in the ſame Circumſtances) will be ſquander'd away upon rival Objects more ſuitable to his Youth, while you will be the Laughing-ſtock and Scorn of ſuch as will revel in <hi>your</hi> Spoils, and triumph over you by the Help of your own <hi>Fortune.</hi> Mean time you will be ſo far from engaging the Pity of your Sex, that the more conſiderate of them, will ſhun and contemn you, as one who has brought a Diſgrace upon it: The Men will deſpiſe and flout you, and you will have nothing to do but to hide in a contemn'd Obſcurity that grey-green Head, which has ſo inconſiderately involved you in ſo much Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and to turn Penitent for it, and pray for an End to a miſerable Life; which, come when it will, will give Cauſe of Joy and Triumph to your young Huſband, and very little Sorrow to any other Perſon.</p>
                  <p>But I hope ſtill for better things; and I hope for Pardon for this Freedom; for fain would I be thought by Mrs. <hi>Bates,</hi>

                  <p>YOU will have me write you down Accounts of what I ſee remarkable in and about <hi>London,</hi> to keep me, as you ſay, out of Idleneſs, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my good Friends in my Abſence. I will obey, tho' your good Opinion of me, I am ſenſible, will be no ſmall Diſadvantage to me; for I ſhall convince you more effectually than ever of my Defects, and want of that Ability to entertain my abſent Friends, which their Partiality had made them expect from me.</p>
                  <p>To begin then, my Aunt and Couſins carried me, in the firſt Place, to ſee the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> which we have heard ſo much Talk of in the Country; and which no one that viſits this great Town, omits ſeeing. 'Tis ſituated by the <hi>Thames</hi> Side, ſurrounded with an old Wall, about a Mile in Compaſs, with a broad deep Ditch, which has generally more Mud in it than Water. All round
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0866800400:230"/>
the outward Wall are Guns planted, which on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſions are fired; as on more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, they fire only Rows of others, which are fixed in the Ground, on the Wharf by the <hi>Thames.</hi> At the Entrance on the Right-hand, we ſaw the Collection of wild Beaſts kept there, as Lions, Panthers, Tygers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo Eagles, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We were then carried to the Mint, where we ſaw the manner of coining Money, and ſtriking Medals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From thence we went to the Jewel-houſe, and were ſhewn the Crown, and the other Regalia; which gave me no ſmall Pleaſure, as I had never ſeen theſe things before, and heard ſo much Talk of them.</p>
                  <p>The Horſe-Armory is a fine Sight; for here they ſhew Fifteen of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchs on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, all in rich Armour, attended with Guards: But I think this Sight not comparable to the ſmall Armory; for here Pikes, Muſkets, Swords, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, and Piſtols, (enow, as they told us, for three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Men) are all placed in ſuch beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Order, and ſuch various Figures, repreſenting the Sun, Star and Garter, Half-moons, and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that I was greatly delighted with the Sight, all the Arms being bright and ſhining.</p>
                  <p>We ſaw the Train of Artillery, in what they call the Grand Storehouſe; filled with Cannon and Mortars, all very fine, a Diving-bell, and other Curioſities; and I thought, upon the whole, that this great Magazine of Curioſities and Stores, was the moſt worthy of the Notice of a Stranger to <hi>London,</hi> of any thing I had been ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>From hence they carried me to the <hi>Monument,</hi> built in Remembrance of the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> a very curious Pillar, from the Gallery of which we had a Survey of the whole City. But as it ſtands
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0866800400:231"/>
low, I cannot ſay, but I liked the Proſpect from <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Cupola much better, when I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up thither, which was Yeſterday; for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt Situation in the City, and more in the Centre of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> commands a finer View over both Cities, <hi>Hampſtead</hi> and <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> Hills, <hi>Surrey,</hi> the River, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral is a moſt noble Building, and I admired it not a little, for its Choir, Chapels, Dome, Whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, Vaults below, and other Curioſities too tedious to mention.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE ſeen the Cuſtom-houſe, a Place of Hurry and Buſineſs, with a crouded and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Key, compared to that of <hi>Briſtol.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0866800400:232"/>
Prodigy of its Kind, and the Admiration of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. <hi>Sadler's-wells,</hi> at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> I have been at, and ſeen there the Diverſions of Rope-dancing, Volting, Singing, Muſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I thought well enough for once. <hi>Iſlington-wells,</hi> or the <hi>New Tunbridge,</hi> I have been at; the Walks and Rooms neat enough, and good Decorum obſerv'd in both.</p>
                  <p>The Blue-coat Hoſpital I have alſo ſeen, another noble Charity; and the pretty Sight of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at Church, and at Supper of <hi>Sunday</hi> Night, which much pleaſed me. The Charter-houſe too, another noble Charity.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the <hi>Guildhall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a handſome Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adorn'd with Pictures, and with the Trophies of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>'s Victory over the <hi>French;</hi> and the prepoſterous wooden Figures of the two famous Giants. The Royal Exchange likewiſe, a very fine Edifice; but they ſay the Statues of the Kings and Queens there, are ill done, except that of <hi>Charles</hi> II. in the Middle of the Area, and one or two more.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo been carried to <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and the two Houſes where the Lords and Commons meet. They are by no means anſwerable to what I expected, tho' the Houſe of Commons is the neateſt, and very convenient for hearing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too. <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> like <hi>Guildhall,</hi> is adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>'s Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies, and it has Shops on each Side for Milaners, Bookſellers, and ſuch-like Trades. Here the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Feaſt is kept; and here are held, as you know, the Courts of Chancery, King's-bench, Common Pleas, and up Stairs the Court and Offices of the Exchequer.</p>

                     <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> I have ſeen, noted for its pleaſant Garden fronting the River; and it is indeed a fine Palace itſelf, deſigned for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of the Queens Dowager of <hi>England,</hi> when we have ſuch a Perſonage. <hi>Marlborough</hi> Houſe in the Park, is finely furniſhed and adorned with Pictures of the Duke's Battles. <hi>St. James</hi>'s Houſe is a poor Palace for a King of <hi>England;</hi> but it ſeems convenient on the Inſide. <hi>Buckingham</hi> Houſe ſtands better than that, for commanding the beautiful Park and Canal.

                  <p>We took Coach another time, and were carried thro' the principal Squares and new Buildings about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which are highly worth ſeeing; ſuch as <hi>Lincoln's-Inn</hi> Square, <hi>Lincoln's-Inn</hi> Fields, <hi>St. James</hi>'s Square, <hi>Soho</hi> Square, <hi>Hanover</hi> Square, <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> Square, and <hi>Groſvenor</hi> Square, with the Multitude of ſtately Buildings, and noble Streets contiguous to the latter; a Sight worthy of Admiration.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been carried by my obliging Couſins to <hi>Chelſea</hi> College, about a Mile from <hi>St. James</hi>'s Park, and to <hi>Kenſington</hi> Palace about two Miles Weſt from <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The College, you know, was founded by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and finiſhed by the late King <hi>William,</hi> for the Reception of ſuperannuated Officers and Soldiers. It is ſituated on the Banks of the <hi>Thames,</hi> its Gardens extending quite down to the River. It is a neat and ſtately Building; the Front looking to the <hi>Thames,</hi> has a fine Hall on one Side, and a neat Chapel on the other, with a noble Pavilion, as they call it, between them. The two Sides are four Stories high, and have two Wards in each Story, containing thirty-ſix neat Bed-rooms each, for ſo many Soldiers. Each Corner of this main Building is adorned with a fine Pavilion, being the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Lodging and Council-chamber; Lodgings for Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Middle of the Square is a Braſs Statue of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. on a Marble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal.</p>
                  <p>There are beſides, four other large and uniform Wings; one is the Infirmary for the Sick, a ſecond for maimed Officers, a third for Officers of the College, the fourth for Servants. The Whole is a neat, convenient and airy Building, well worth a Stranger's View.</p>

                     <hi>Kenſington</hi> Palace is a very pretty Summer Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Court: It is adorn'd with fine Pictures,

rich Hangings, and other Ornaments.

                  <p>LAST <hi>Tueſday,</hi> being <hi>Eaſter Tueſday,</hi> I went with my Uncle, Aunt and Couſins, down the River, on what they call a <hi>Party of Pleaſure;</hi> but with Deſign principally to ſee <hi>Greenwich</hi> Park and Hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0866800400:236"/>
We took Water at the Tower, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in my firſt Letter: I was pretty much afraid of Danger from Anchors, Cables, and ſuch-like, as we paſſed by the great Numbers of Ships, that lay in our Way at firſt ſetting out. But afterwards the River looked very pleaſant, and the Number of Boats all rowing with the Tide, made the River look very agreeably.</p>
                  <p>After ſailing not many Miles, we come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sight of the Dock-yard at <hi>Deptford,</hi> where ſeveral large Ships upon the Stocks afforded a fine Proſpect; as the naval Strength of <hi>England</hi> is both its Glory and its Defence.</p>
                  <p>Next to <hi>Deptford,</hi> I was greatly pleaſed with the Proſpect of the Royal Hoſpital at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> for Seamen grown old in the Service of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. When we landed, we went into this fine Building; and in the <hi>Inſide,</hi> every thing, in my Judgment, was perfectly agreeable to the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the <hi>Outſide;</hi> allowing the one to be deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do Honour to the Nation, the other to ſupport a Number of neceſſitous People, who ought to be the publick Care. The great Hall, and the Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in it, are admirable; but I know not whether they would not better ſuit a <hi>Palace,</hi> than an <hi>Hoſpital;</hi> and indeed this may be ſaid of the whole Building.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went into the Park; where I beheld divers odd Scenes of Holiday-folks. Here appeared a rakiſh young Fellow, with two or three Women who look'd like Servant-maids; the Hero delighted, the Nymphs ſmiling round him—There a careful-looking Father with his Children on each Side; Trains of admiring Lovers, ready-pair'd, followed one another in thronging Crouds at the Gate; a Sea-Officer, with a Lady not over-burdened with Modeſty in her Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: A Croud of City Apprentices, ſome with,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0866800400:237"/>
ſome without their Laſſes: Half a dozen Beaux ogling all they met: And ſeveral ſeemingly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Virgins walking alone. The Concourſe of middling Objects preſſed chiefly toward a high Hill in the Middle of the Park; where, as they arrived, their Buſineſs was to take hold of Hands, and run down as faſt as poſſible, amidſt the Huzza's of a Multitude of People, who earneſtly expected to ſee the Women fall, in hopes that their Cloaths would not lie ſo conveniently, when they were down, as might be wiſhed.</p>

                  <p>YOU tell me, in your laſt, that my Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Obſervations are very ſuperficial, and that both my Uncle and yourſelf expect from me much better Accounts, than I have yet given you; for I muſt deliver my <hi>Opinion,</hi> it ſeems, on what I ſee, as well as tell you what I have been ſhewn. 'Tis well I left my bettermoſt Subjects to the laſt; ſuch, I mean, as will beſt bear Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and I muſt try what I can do, to regain that Reputation which your Indulgence, rather than my Merit, had formed for me in your kind
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0866800400:238"/>
Thoughts—Yet, I doubt, I ſhan't pleaſe you, after all. But 'tis my Duty to try for it, and it will be yours, I had almoſt ſaid, to forgive Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which I ſhould have concealed, but for your undeſerved good Opinions of me, which draw them into Light.</p>
                  <p>I have this Afternoon been with my Couſins, to gratify the odd Curioſity moſt People have to ſee <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> or <hi>Bedlam</hi> Hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>A more affecting Scene my Eyes never beheld; and ſurely, Madam, any one inclined to be proud of human Nature, and to value themſelves above others, cannot go to a Place that will more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually convince them of their Folly: For there we ſee Man deſtitute of every Mark of Reaſon and Wiſdom, and levelled to the Brute Creation, if not beneath it; and all the Remains of good Senſe or Education, ſerve only to make the unhappy Perſon appear more deplorable!</p>
                  <p>I had the Shock of ſeeing the late polite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> in one of theſe woful Chambers: We had heard, you know, of his being ſomewhat diſordered; but I did not expect to find him here: No ſooner did I put my Face to the Grate, but he leap'd from his Bed, and called me, with fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fervency, to come into his Room. The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize affected me pretty much; and my Confuſion being obſerved by a Croud of Strangers, I heard it preſently whiſper'd, That I was his Sweetheart, and the Cauſe of his Misfortune. My Couſin aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me ſuch Fancies were frequent upon theſe Occaſions: But this Accident drew ſo many Eyes upon me, as obliged me ſoon to quit the Place.</p>
                  <p>I was much at a Loſs to account for the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Generality of People, who were looking at theſe melancholy Objects. Inſtead of the Concern I think unavoidable at ſuch a Sight, a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0866800400:239"/>
ſort of Mirth appeared on their Countenances; and the diſtemper'd Fancies of the miſerable Patients moſt unaccountably provoked Mirth, and loud Laughter, in the unthinking Auditors; and the many hideous Roarings, and wild Motions of others, ſeemed equally entertaining to them. Nay, ſo ſhamefully inhuman were ſome, among whom (I am ſorry to ſay it!) were ſeveral of my own Sex, as to endeavour to provoke the Patients into Rage, to make them Sport.</p>
                  <p>I have been told, this dreadful Place is often uſed for the Reſort of lewd Perſons to meet and make Aſſignments: But that I cannot credit; ſince the Heart muſt be abandon'd indeed, that could be vicious amidſt ſo many Examples of Miſery, and of ſuch Miſery, as, being wholly involuntary, may overtake the moſt ſecure.</p>
                  <p>I am no great Admirer of publick Charities, as they are too often managed; but if we conſider the Impoſſibility of poor Peoples bearing this Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or providing ſuitably for the Diſtempered at their own Beings, no Praiſe can ſurely be too great for the Founders and Supporters of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, which none can viſit, without receiving the moſt melancholy <hi>Proof</hi> of its being needful.

                  <p>I WENT on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt to <hi>Vaux-hall</hi> Gardens; whither every body muſt go, or appear a ſort of Monſter in polite Company. For the Convenience
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0866800400:240"/>
of Waterage, as well as of Converſation, we were a pretty large Company, and the Evening proved ſerene and clear.</p>
                  <p>The Paſſage from <hi>Somerſet</hi> Stairs, where we took Water, was pleaſant enough; the <hi>Thames</hi> at High-water being a moſt beautiful River, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally above <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the green Banks, and the open Country, afford a very agreeable Proſpect. The Place we landed at was crouded with Boats, and from the Water-ſide to the Gardens, we walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a double Line of gaping Watermen, Footmen, old Beggar-women and Children. As ſoon as we entered the Walks, I was pleaſed with a ſort of Stage, or Scaffold, raiſed at the Entrance, for the Servants of the Company to ſit out of their Maſters way, and yet within Call of the Waiters.</p>
                  <p>The Muſick-gallery and Organ look perfectly polite, and their being raiſed one Story from the Ground, has a good Effect upon the Muſick. The Walks are well enough, but environ'd with paltry wooden Boards, where I expected at leaſt a good Brick-wall. One Part of the Whole is thrown into Walks only; the other is on the Sides filled with Seats or Arbours, with painted Backs; on each of which is repreſented ſome Scene of our moſt common Plays, or the youthful Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Infant Games, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I happened to have at my Back honeſt <hi>Hob,</hi> come dripping wet out of the Well; and the young Fellows, under Colour of ſhewing their Taſte in obſerving the Beauties of the Piece, were ſo perpetually ſtaring in our Faces, that Couſin <hi>Bet</hi> and I had little Pleaſure in our Supper. Perhaps you will wonder at our Supping in ſo open a Place; but, I aſſure you, Madam, no Lady is too tender for ſo faſhionable a Repaſt. My Uncle treated us very chearfully; but I could not help grudging the Expence he was at;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0866800400:241"/>
for when the Reckoning was paid, it amounted to no leſs than Ten Shillings a Head; which I think too dear, as the Entrance-money muſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defray the Houſe and Muſick. But as the Whole is devoted to Pleaſure, the Expence ſeems rather to create Satisfaction, than Diſtaſte, as it gives an Opportunity to gallant People to oblige thoſe they love, or pretend to love, in order, moſt of them, to pay themſelves again with large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                  <p>The Figure of Mr. <hi>Handel,</hi> a great Maſter of Muſick, ſtands on one Side the Gardens, and looks pretty enough: The Muſick plays from Five to Ten, about three Tunes (I believe I ſhould have ſaid Pieces) in an Hour. They are all reported to be the beſt Performers who aſſiſt here: but my rough Ears cannot diſtinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>About Ten o' Clock, many People think of Home: But the Votaries of <hi>Cupid,</hi> I am told, about that Time, viſit the remoteſt Walks, and ſigh out the ſoft Paſſion in Accents that may poſſibly be improved by the melting Sweetneſs of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick—I would not have you from hence conclude any Rudeneſs can be offered; for at the Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Walk, through the whole Garden is placed a Man to protect the Company from all manner of Inſult. But when the Place grows thin of Company, the Lovers have a better Chance to eſcape being laugh'd at, on the Appearance of any amorous Symptom.</p>
                  <p>Soon after Ten, we returned to our Boat; and I found the Paſſage extremely cold, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Covering over us: I muſt own, I wiſh'd to be at home, long before I reached it; for I was taken with ſuch a Shivering, as did not leave me for two Days.</p>

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0866800400:242"/>
Thus, Madam, have I been at <hi>Vaux-hall,</hi> with the Crowd of Faſhion-hunters. But if nobody had a greater Inclination than I have to go thither again, that Amuſement would ſoon be given up—For I ſee more and more, that, do what I will, Nature never deſigned me to be polite; and I can ſincerely declare, that I take more Satisfaction in an Evening-walk with you up the <hi>Weſt-grove,</hi> where I am ſo often benefited by your good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, than in the inchanting Shades of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much celebrated <hi>Vaux-hall.</hi> I am, honoured Madam,</p>

                     <salute>Honoured Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE this Afternoon been at <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> and not a little pleaſed with what I have ſeen there. If there can be Majeſty in the Grave, here we ſee it: And ſuch was the ſolemn Effect the ſacred Repoſitory had upon me, that I never found an awful Reverence equal to what I felt on that Occaſion. Whatever be the Intention of erecting theſe coſtly Monuments, they ſeem to me very capable of being made an excellent Sermon to ſucceeding Generations; for here the moſt ſumptuous Piles ſerve only to ſhew, that every one of us muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the ſame Fate, that has overtaken thoſe whom Empire itſelf could not ſave. And how humble ought the Perſon to be, who ſurveys the Royal Ruins of Mortality, preſerved (as if in a vain Defiance
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0866800400:243"/>
of Time) to ſhew nothing more than the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianty of our Diſſolution!</p>
                  <p>Theſe, Madam, were my general Sentiments on this Occaſion; but as I know you expect more particular Deſcriptions from me, I will tell you what moſt ſtruck my Notice among the many remarkable Curioſities to be here met with.</p>
                  <p>Among the Royal Monuments, thoſe of antient Date pleaſed me beſt; becauſe they look agreeable to what I read of the plain Royalty of our former Sovereigns. I lamented the Loſs of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth's Head, which being Silver, as they ſay, was ſtolen during the Civil War. I much wonder it has never yet been ſupply'd from ſome of his Buſto's. He wanted not a <hi>Head,</hi> to ſpeak in the metaphorical Style, while living; and <hi>France</hi> can teſtify, that his <hi>Heart</hi> deſerved all things of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men: For he was the Terror of the one, and the Glory of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chapel, in every Part of it, is ſurpriſingly magnificent and beautiful; and, as far as I can judge of ſuch Things, far ſurpaſſes all I have ſeen, either of antient or modern Date.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapel is the Chair in which our Kings for many Ages have been crown'd. 'Tis very plain, and looks as if it were not worth more than the Forfeit paid for ſitting in it.</p>
                  <p>The Body of Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> Conſort to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, was ſhewn us in an open Coffin; and what remains of Skin, looks like black diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured Parchment. She is ſaid to have been very beautiful; and, ſurely, to view her now, is a moſt effectual Antidote againſt the Vanity riſing from that dangerous Accompliſhment.</p>
                  <p>Two Embaſſadors Coffins are kept here, ſaid to be detained for want of having their Debts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. This, indeed, does little Credit to the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0866800400:244"/>
Crown they ſerved; but I can ſcarce think it the Diſhonour deſign'd them, to be repoſited among the Remains of our Kings; tho' indeed ſeveral of <hi>them</hi> have their Debts unpaid too, as I am told.</p>
                  <p>Several Effigies are preſerved in Wax; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of King <hi>William,</hi> and his excellent Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> as alſo, very lately, the truly Royal Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> To be ſure, this is no bad Way, for a few Years, to preſerve their Likeneſs; but I know not whether ſuch gay Repreſentations ſuit the Solemnity of a Sepulchre. And yet ſome that ſtand here, ſeem not to have deſerved that Diſtinction, if it be deemed one, in Favour of their Memories. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk,</hi> if I were to judge, would be one of thoſe; for his conſtant Train of Hypocriſy for a long time, ſeem'd a Contradiction to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Precept, <hi>Not to do Evil, that Good may come of it.</hi> A Ducheſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who walked at King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Coronation, never was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for any thing, as I can hear, but that.</p>
                  <p>A very coſtly Effigy of the late Duke of <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> is in this Place, who was ſomewhat remarkable in his Time, but chiefly for doing what pleaſed himſelf, whether any body elſe was pleaſed or better'd by it, or not. And, what is odd enough, the preſent Ducheſs ſtands by him. Her Son too, the laſt Duke, who died juſt before he came of Age, is diſtinguiſhed with an Oſtentation ſuperior to all the reſt; tho' all I can learn of him is, that he was a hopeful young Nobleman, and the Darling of his Mother.</p>
                  <p>General <hi>Monk,</hi> whom I mentioned before, in a Habit mourning the Power of Time, ſtands in a Poſture ſo very fierce, as to ſeem rather intended to ſcare Children, than for any other Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt forgot his Royal Maſter, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, who ſtands in his Garter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Robes, and has long been admired by all Comers, it ſeems, for reſtoring Monarchy; for I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no worthy Actions in his Hiſtory, nor were we told any more, by the Perſon who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Image to our View.</p>
                  <p>Many Reaſons make it neceſſary for the Wills of deceaſed Perſons to be literally obſerved, tho' ſome Inſtances of this kind do little Honour to the Deceaſed; as a Monument erected to the Conſort of a noble Lord, for whom a Vacancy being left on his Tomb, as for his ſecond Wife, ſhe, becauſe ſhe could not take the Right-hand of his firſt Lady, left ſtrict Order to be bury'd where her Bones now lie, and thereby has tranſmitted her Pride and Folly to ſucceeding Ages.</p>
                  <p>Near this Tomb, is the Figure of a Lady bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Death by pricking her Finger: She was Maid of Honour to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and, I think, of the <hi>Ruſſel</hi> Family. It ſeems ſhe got her fatal Wound at her Needle; and ſuch has been the Care of the Ladies who have ſucceeded her, that not one has fallen under the like Misfortune ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhall not quite tire you, I will proceed with this Subject in my next—And am, mean time, honoured Madam,</p>

                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0866800400:246"/>
At entering the North-gate, a Monument of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Size, and great Expence, ſtood on my Left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand: It is that of <hi>John Holles</hi> late Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> and all that is left him, out of upwards of 50000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, as they tell me he had accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the two Heirs not much the richer for their Shares of it neither. I hope, as we ſay in our Country Phraſe, <hi>it was honeſtly got.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to this is one conſecrated to the Memory of the Duke that preceded him, the laſt of his Name of the <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> Family, as the other was of the <hi>Holles;</hi> with the celebrated Lady, his Ducheſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> a great Writer, and a great Chymiſt, (you know we have her Olio) both lying Side by Side, on a Tomb made great by their Names, and diſtinguiſhed by their Adventures; but as to outward Grandeur, wholly eclipſed by the former. Behind theſe is a large Room, or little Chapel, ſeparated from the publick Places, in which are repoſited the <hi>Holles</hi> Family. One of theſe Gentlemen has at his Feet the Repreſentation of a wild Boar, in Token of his having killed one of thoſe Animals, when he was on a Croiſade. Another has a large black Patch over his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eye, having loſt an Eye on the like Expedition.</p>
                  <p>Not far from hence, a fine Monument ſtands, to the Memory of Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> a Man-mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, of no great Fame when living, but who happened to have the Eſteem of the preſent Ducheſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who erected this to his Memory.</p>
                  <p>A magnificent Monument ſtands near this, of a Lady, whoſe Name is <hi>Carteret;</hi> and ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports aſſign an odd Cauſe for her Death; <hi>viz.</hi> the late <hi>French</hi> King's ſaying, <hi>A Lady one of his Nobles compared to her, was the handſomeſt of the two.</hi>

A fine Monument of Lord <hi>Courcey</hi> ſtands near this; on which, we are told, One of his Anceſtors had a Privilege granted, of wearing his Hat before the King—Here are ſeveral Monuments of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who fell in the late Wars; Col. <hi>Bringfield,</hi> in particular, who had his Head ſhot off by a Cannon Ball, as he was mounting the Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> who had a Horſe ſhot under him. Thoſe of others who were famous for different Talents; as my Favourite <hi>Purcel,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Crofts,</hi> for Muſick, decorate the North Iſle; at the Head of which ſtands Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller,</hi> Painter to his late Majeſty; but with a Copy of Verſes on it, that, Judges ſay, are not very extraordinary, and yet Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Name is affixed to them. In a Corner, that anſwers to it, on the South-ſide of the Weſt-gate, ſtands a curious Reſemblance of <hi>James Craggs,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State in 1720. erected by a certain Ducheſs, for what Reaſon is not ſaid. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has been laviſh of his Praiſes, much more being engraved on this Gentleman's Monument of his Virtue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than I ever heard any-where elſe. But they ſay he was a companionable Man, as ſome call it, and eaſy of Acceſs—A ſmall Diſtance from this, is a Monument erected by another Ducheſs, Siſter of the former, to the Memory of Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> from the great Eſteem ſhe bore him. So here are three Monuments erected to three Favourites, by three Ducheſſes. What a generous Sex is ours, who carry their Eſteem for the Merit of thoſe they favour, beyond the Grave! On the ſame Side of the Church is a very ſlight Monument of the great Earl <hi>Godolphin,</hi> who was Ld. High Treaſurer, during the proſperous Part of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Reign; and the mean Appearance this makes, when compared with thoſe of Mr. <hi>Craggs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> &amp;c. makes a Spectator ſenſible, that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0866800400:248"/>
a Judgment of the Deceaſed's Merits muſt not be formed from their Monuments; nor, as is to be hoped, the Gratitude and Affection of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents either. Sir <hi>Cloudeſly Shovel</hi> has great Honour done him, his Monument being erected at the Expence of his Royal Miſtreſs. But I thought he was a rough <hi>honeſt Tar;</hi> yet his Effigies makes him a <hi>great Beau,</hi> with a fine flowing full-bottom'd Periwig; ſuch a one, but much finer, and more in Buckle, than that we have ſeen our Lawyer Mr. <hi>Kettleby</hi> wear at our Aſſizes.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s Murder is prettily repreſented on his Tomb—But before I ſtep into what is call'd the <hi>Poets Row,</hi> I muſt return to the Door of the Choir; on the North-ſide of which is placed a noble Monument of the great Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> which I humbly apprehend to be needleſs; for has he not built for himſelf a much finer Monument, and a much more durable one, than Marble? And will it not out-laſt this we ſee here, and the Abbey which contains it? He lies in a contemplative Poſture, leaning on the Volumes that have made his Name immortal. Oppoſite to him, at the South Entrance of the ſame Door, is a very grand Pile, to the Memory of the late Earl <hi>Stanhope,</hi> a brave Soldier, tho' unfortunate in one Battle; and a Man of great Probity.</p>
                  <p>On one Side of the Poets are Dr. <hi>South</hi> and Dr. <hi>Buſby;</hi> the one an humorous and witty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, the other as remarkable a School-maſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing famous for his Diſcipline and Severity. <hi>Geoffry Chaucer</hi> has reach'd us: <hi>Spencer</hi> is near him; <hi>Philips</hi> not far from <hi>Spencer. Ben. Johnſon</hi> is written on a poor Buſt: and <hi>Butler</hi> (put up by a Printer, to make his own Name famous) bears him Company. I would fain not name <hi>Matt.

However, <hi>Milton</hi>'s Memory is a Tree that will do Honour to the weakeſt Scyon that ſhall ſprout from it, or even to a Dung-hill, were ſuch a thing to lie at its Root.

But pray, Madam, can you tell me, (for I have already aſked twenty, not one of whom will anſwer me) What is the Reaſon of having every Word ſpoken, ſqueaked to—I cannot ſay a Tune, but to ſuch a <hi>Hum</hi> as makes me quite ſick? If it be the Muſick that is valuable, why muſt the Words torture it? And if the Words be ſought after, wherefore ſhould they be broken to Pieces by Notes that drown the Sound, and quite loſe their Senſe? What I mean is, I believe, called, Speaking in Recitative; but whence was this Mode of Speech taken? In what Country is it natural? And if it be natural no-where, of what is it an Imitation? What are the Marks of its Excellencies? and how ſhall we judge of its Merit? Whence can ariſe any Pleaſure from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? And ſhall we find Cauſe for excuſing the Time loſt in ſuch an unnatural Amuſement? For myſelf, I muſt own 'twas far from delighting me; for as it was neither ſinging nor ſpeaking, I could not tell what to make of it; for it was more like to make me cry than laugh, I was ſo provoked, when the Twang of the Harpſichord robbed me of the Word the whole preceding Line depended upon!—I muſt confeſs myſelf for downright Speaking or Singing: I hate Mongrels. Unleſs my Judgment be convinced by ſuch Reaſons as I can't, for my Life, hit upon at preſent. Yet, after all, I begin to think, I am betraying my Ignorance all this time; and ſo I'll conclude myſelf, Madam,</p>

                  <head>X. On the Diverſions of the Play-houſe.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>Honoured Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>NOW I have, by your Indulgence, tarry'd in Town till the Approach of Winter, you will expect that I ſhould give you a little Account of the Diverſions of the Stage. To begin then: My Couſin <hi>William</hi> and his two Siſters conducted me laſt Night to the Playhouſe, and we took Places in the Pit.</p>
                  <p>You may believe I was agreeably ſurpriſed at the Magnificence of the Stage, and its elegant Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I was mightily pleaſed to ſee ſuch a prodigious Number of People ſeated with Eaſe, and conveniently placed to hear the natural Pitch of a common Voice. I did not expect to find the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſo near the Audience; but believe <hi>that</hi> the moſt proper Situation to convey the Sound over the whole Theatre.</p>
                  <p>The Play I ſaw was a Comedy, in which the Parts acted by Women had ſeveral Speeches that I thought not quite conſiſtent with the Modeſty of the Sex. And the Freedom of their Voice and Geſtures, tho', perhaps, ſuitable enough to the Characters they repreſented, were not ſo pleaſing to a Mind bent upon innocent Amuſement, (if not wholly upon Inſtruction) as Speeches that put us not to the Expence of a Bluſh. What Hardſhip muſt it be to the Minds of theſe Women, to enter firſt upon this Employment? How muſt their Virtue (and ſure no Woman is without Virtue at her Entrance into the World) be ſhock'd to offer themſelves for the Entertainment of Six
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0866800400:252"/>
hundred Men, and to utter Words which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Ideas too groſs for a modeſt Ear, and ſuch as would be difficult to hear in private Company without Confuſion! How hard then muſt the Utterance of them be to a numerous and gay Aſſembly! And yet, I am aſſured, ſeveral Women who get their Bread upon the Stage, are ſtrictly virtuous. If ſuch there are, how great muſt be their Merit, when compared with that of the wicked ones of our Sex, who are liable to none of their certain and numerous Temptations? But yet, where it can be avoided, why ſhould Women ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to certain Dangers, if there is a Poſſibility of obtaining a tolerable Subſiſtence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it? And thoſe who can live by Performance upon the Stage, certainly require Qualifications more than ſufficient to ſubſiſt in ſafer and leſs dependent Stations.</p>
                  <p>The Behaviour of the Men, I did not ſo much wonder at; for a becoming Aſſurance in them is rather pleaſing than diſobliging: Nor did I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that ſo many Expreſſions, which are oftener miſcalled <hi>arch,</hi> than more truly named <hi>obſcene,</hi> were put into the Mouths of the Men as of the Women; tho' the Reaſon the Poets have for this I cannot gueſs.</p>
                  <p>The Conduct of the Company I thought, to the higheſt Degree, commendable: The utmoſt Decency was obſerved, and I ſaw nothing diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſtricteſt Politeneſs or good Manners; the Awe given by ſo great an Audience of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Taſte, being too much to admit any thing but what is decent and obliging: Not that I think it adviſeable for Women to go alone to the Play-houſe; for the <hi>Complaiſance,</hi> ſo faſhionable at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, affords a ſort of <hi>Occaſion</hi> for laying them under ſuch ſeeming Obligations as cannot be

                  <p>HAving, as I told you in my laſt, ſeen a Comedy, I was next carried by my Couſin <hi>William,</hi> and his kind Siſters, to a Tragedy; which was that of <hi>Hamlet:</hi> And I was greatly moved with the Play, and pleaſed with the Action. But the low Scenes of <hi>Harlequinery</hi> that were exhibited afterwards, filled me with high Diſguſt, inſomuch that I could, for their ſake, have wiſhed I had not ſeen the other. I will give you an Account of this diſmal Piece of farcical dumb Shew.</p>
                  <p>We were, then, preſented with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gentleman I ever beheld, who, with the uglieſt Face, and moſt apiſh Behaviour I ever ſaw, had the moſt amazing Succeſs in his Amours, with Ladies whoſe Appearance deſerved a more amiable Gallant.</p>
                  <p>My Couſin <hi>William</hi> told me the Name of this Hero was MR. HARLEQUIN; but as you know <hi>Billy</hi> has no great Capacity, you will be the leſs ſurpriſed to hear he anſwered not one Queſtion I aſked him to my Satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To be admired by every Woman who ſets Eyes on him.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE this Day been ſatisfying a Curioſity I believe natural to moſt People, by ſeeing an Execution at <hi>Tyburn:</hi> The Sight has had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Effect upon me, which is more owing to the unexpected Oddneſs of the Scene, than the affecting Concern which is unavoidable in a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon, at a Spectacle ſo awful, and ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to all who conſider themſelves of the ſame Species with the unhappy Sufferer.</p>
                  <p>That I might the better view the Priſoners, and eſcape the Preſſure of the Mob, which is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, nay, almoſt incredible, if we conſider the Frequency of theſe Executions in <hi>London,</hi> which is once a Month; I mounted my Horſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the melancholy Cavalcade from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> to the fatal Tree. The Criminals were Five in Number. I was much diſappointed at the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern and Careleſneſs that appeared in the Faces of Three of the unhappy Wretches: The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of the other Two were ſpread with that Horror and Deſpair which is not to be wonder'd at in Men whoſe Period of Life is ſo near, with the terrible Aggravation of its being haſten'd by their own voluntary Indiſcretion and Miſdeeds. The Exhortation ſpoken by the Bell-man, from the Wall of <hi>St. Sepulchre</hi>'s Church-yard, is well intended; but the Noiſe of the Officers, and the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0866800400:257"/>
Mob, was ſo great, and the ſilly Curioſity of People climbing into the Cart to take leave of the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, made ſuch a confuſed Noiſe, that I could not hear the Words of the Exhortation when ſpoken; tho' they are as follow:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"All good People, pray heartily to GOD for theſe poor Sinners, who now are going to their Deaths; for whom this great Bell doth toll."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You that are condemn'd to die, repent with lamentable Tears. Aſk Mercy of the Lord for the Salvation of your own Souls, thro' the Merits, Death, and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, who now ſits at the Right-hand of God, to make Interceſſion for as many of you as peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently return unto him."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Lord have Mercy upon you! Chriſt have Mercy upon you!</hi>"</q>—Which laſt Words the Bell-man repeats three times.</p>
                  <p>All the way up <hi>Holborn</hi> the Croud was ſo great, as at every twenty or thirty Yards, to obſtruct the Paſſage; and Wine, notwithſtanding a late good Order againſt that Practice, was brought the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, who drank greedily of it, which I thought did not ſuit well with their deplorable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: After this, the Three thoughtleſs young Men, who at <hi>firſt</hi> ſeemed not enough concerned, grew moſt ſhamefully daring and wanton; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having themſelves in a manner that would have been ridiculous in Men in any Circumſtance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: They ſwore, laugh'd, and talk'd obſcenely, and wiſh'd their wicked Companions good Luck, with as much Aſſurance as if their Employment had been the moſt lawful.</p>
                  <p>At the Place of Execution, the Scene grew ſtill more ſhocking; and the Clergyman who attended
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0866800400:258"/>
was more the Subject of Ridicule, than of their ſerious Attention. The Pſalm was ſung amidſt the Curſes and Quarrelling of Hundreds of the moſt abandon'd and profligate of Mankind: Upon whom (ſo ſtupid are they to any Senſe of Decency) all the Preparation of the unhappy Wretches ſeems to ſerve only for Subject of a barbarous kind of Mirth, altogether inconſiſtent with Humanity. And as ſoon as the poor Creatures were half dead, I was much ſurpriſed, before ſuch a Number of Peace-Officers, to ſee the Populace fall to halling and pulling the Carcaſſes with ſo much Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to occaſion ſeveral warm Rencounters, and broken Heads. Theſe, I was told, were the Friends of the Perſons executed, or ſuch as, for the ſake of Tumult, choſe to appear ſo, and ſome Perſons ſent by private Surgeons to obtain Bodies for Diſſection. The Conteſts between theſe were ſierce and bloody, and frightful to look at: So that I made the beſt of my way out of the Crowd, and, with ſome Difficulty, rode back among a large Number of People, who had been upon the ſame Errand with myſelf. The Face of every one ſpoke a kind of Mirth, as if the Spectacle they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held had afforded Pleaſure inſtead of Pain, which I am wholly unable to account for.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE, on ſo many Occaſions, as well of this, as other kinds, been obliged to your kind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for me, that I ſhould be very ingrateful, if I conceal'd from you the leaſt Byaſs of my Mind on ſo important an Occaſion. I think truly with you, that Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> is a very valuable Gentleman; yet he is over-nice ſometimes as to the Company I ſee; and would take upon him a little too much, if I did not keep him at a Diſtance; and particularly is ſo uneaſy about the Captain, that he wants me to forbear ſeeing him on any Occaſion. Now, I think, this is a little too preſcribing, for the Time
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0866800400:261"/>
of our Acquaintance, and the ſmall Progreſs I have hitherto permitted to the Intimacy between us. For what is this but ſurrendering to him upon his own Terms? and that, too, before I am ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned in Form? Nothing but a <hi>betrothed</hi> Lover, or a <hi>Huſband,</hi> has ſurely a Right to expect this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance; and if I were to oblige him, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely putting myſelf in his Power, before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces me how he will uſe it. O my dear Aunt, theſe Men, I ſee, even the worthieſt of them, are incroaching Creatures!—And a Woman that would not be deſpis'd, muſt not make her Will too cheap an Offering to that of her Admirer. Then, my dear Aunt, I know not how it was with <hi>you</hi> formerly; but there is a Pleaſure in being admired, that affects one very ſenſibly; and I know not whether even Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> would ſay half the fine Things he does, if he had not a Competitor that ſays nothing elſe. And I think it a kind of Robbery that a Woman commits upon her Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, if ſhe <hi>too ſoon</hi> confines herſelf to one. For ſhe can be but once courted; unleſs ſuch an Event happens, that ſhe muſt have a very bad Heart, that can wiſh for it. And why ſhould a Woman ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bind herſelf to the Terms of <hi>For Better or For Worſe,</hi> before ſhe goes to Church?—I hope, when the Ceremony has paſſed, I ſhall make a very good Wife: But why ſhould I buckle to <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi> when it is all the Time I ſhall have to be <hi>honoured</hi> and <hi>obeyed</hi> myſelf?—Indeed, Aunt, I think, there is a great deal in this. And Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> gives himſelf wonderful <hi>grave Airs</hi> already: As I'll give you an Inſtance—But here the Captain is come, and I will give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in my next.

                  <p>I HOPE, the Suſpenſe I gave you by my abrupt breaking off in my laſt, will be forgiven. I was going to give you an Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi>'s <hi>grave Airs.</hi> He comes laſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> with great Formality, and calls himſelf <hi>my humble Servant;</hi> and I ſaw he was pleaſed to be diſpleaſed at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo look'd as grave as he, only bowing my Head, and following my Work; for I was hemming a Handkerchief. <hi>You are very buſy, Madam</hi>—Yes, Sir—<hi>Perhaps I break in upon you</hi>—Not much, Sir—<hi>I am ſorry if I do at all, Madam</hi>—You ſee I am purſuing my Work, as I was before you came.—<hi>I do, Madam!</hi>—very gravely, ſaid he—<hi>But I have known it otherwiſe, when Somebody elſe has been here</hi>—Very likely, Sir!—But then I did as I pleaſed—ſo I do now—and who ſhall controul me?—<hi>I beg pardon, Madam; but 'tis my Value for you</hi>—That makes you troubleſome, ſaid I, interrupting him.—<hi>I am ſorry for it, Madam!—Your humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>—Yours, Sir.—So away he went.—Well, thought I, if thou art to be loſt for this, and muſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0866800400:263"/>
put me into bodily Fear, every time thou haſt a Mind to be grave, Adieu to thee!</p>
                  <p>In the Evening he comes again—<hi>Mrs.</hi> Betty, <hi>Is your Lady diſingaged? Could I be admitted to ſay one Word to her?</hi> I believe ſo, Sir. Madam, Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> begs to be admitted to ſay one Word to you. He was at the Door, and heard me, as I know. Do you <hi>introduce</hi> him, ſaid I, (with as much Form as he) to my Preſence. He enter'd. I roſe up, with my Hands before me—<hi>I ſee you are angry with me, Madam.</hi>—I am ſorry for it, Sir, ſaid I. <hi>Sorry for your Anger, I hope, Madam?</hi>—I ſhould be ſorry, Sir, ſaid I, if any body ſhould ſee me angry for nothing.—<hi>I am ſorry, Madam, that you ſet as nothing one that has ſo much Value for you.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> ſaid I, we have ſo many <hi>Sorry's</hi> between us, that I ſhould be pleas'd with a few <hi>Glad's!</hi>—<hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>with this ſtiff, ſet Air, do you delight to vex thus an Heart that you can make</hi> ſorry <hi>or</hi> glad <hi>at your Pleaſure?</hi>—Why am I, Sir, to be treated capriciouſly, and to have my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct upbraided, when you think proper to be out of Humour?—<hi>I out of Humour, Madam!</hi>—I thought ſo—Was it in high good Humour that you inſulted, me with <hi>that Somebody elſe?</hi>—<hi>I own, Madam, I cannot bear to ſee you ſo gay, ſo pleaſed, and lively, when that painted Butterfly is here; and ſo grave, ſo laconick, ſo reſerv'd, when I pay my Reſpects to you.</hi> Pr'ythee, pr'ythee, Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> none of theſe preſcribing Airs!—What Right have I given you to uſe me thus?—<hi>Madam, I hoped my Addreſs was not quite unwelcome.</hi>—What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Addreſs is, your Preſcriptions are.—<hi>I cannot, where I ſo much love, bear ſuch a Difference as I always ſee in your Temper, when that Flutterer is here, to what I experience</hi>—The Difference perhaps may be in the <hi>Men,</hi> not in the <hi>Woman. As how,</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0866800400:264"/>
                     <hi>Madam?</hi> As how! Why, ſaid I, he makes me laugh, and if I was to give way to't, your grave Airs would make me cry!—<hi>Thank you, Madam, ſaid he! What's Sport to you, is Death to me!</hi>—And ſo he ſigh'd, and took a Turn or two about the Room—I was ſtanding all this time.</p>
                  <p>He came, and took my Hand, and look'd ſo ſilly upon me, I half pity'd him: <hi>I hope, Madam, I don't keep you ſtanding!</hi>—Yes, you do, Sir!—<hi>I beg, Madam, you'll not torture me with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous Formality!</hi>—I think I am the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant Creature breathing!—<hi>To ME, Madam, do you mean!</hi>—Yes, Sir—<hi>You always mean ſomething in your Paradoxes, Madam: May I aſk your Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now?</hi>—When I laſt ſat and purſued my Work, you were diſpleaſed. I now ſtand, and have nothing to do but to be entertain'd in ſuch an agreeable manner as you ſhall think propereſt for me—yet you are not pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you put me quite beſide my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes!—If I thought you would have it ſo, I would ſooner die than be ſo troubleſome to you, as I now have Reaſon to think myſelf</hi>—If you have Reaſon to think ſo, I hope you are Maſter of your own Actions, ſaid I—<hi>Do you forbid me your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for ever, Madam?</hi>—I do, if you aſk it, Sir. (Was not this, Madam, daring me to anſwer even worſe?)—I <hi>aſk it, Madam! Heaven is my Witneſs, it would be the heavieſt thing that could befal me</hi>—You would not thus brave it from me, if you thought ſo, ſaid I, quite nettled.</p>
                  <p>In this manner we went on, till we had vex'd one another to ſome Purpoſe; and then he was ſo <hi>good</hi> as to give me Leave to ſit down, and I was ſo <hi>gracious</hi> as to permit him to ſit by me; and we parted with no Diſpleaſure on either Side.

                  <p>INOW give you ſome Account of the Captain. He is a handſome Perſon of a Man, of a good Family: Heir to a good Eſtate: Dreſſes well, ſings well, dances well—So much for his <hi>good</hi> Qualities. As for his others; he is inſufferably vain; talkative; is always laughing, eſpecially at what he <hi>ſays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and, ſometimes, at the Conceit of what he is <hi>going to ſay,</hi> before he <hi>ſpeaks:</hi> He has ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Aſſurance, that there is no ſuch thing as putting him out of Countenance. One Inſtance I'll give you—He is always admiring himſelf in the Glaſs; inſomuch that while he is in the Room, I cannot peep into one without ſtaring him in the Face; and one Day rallying him on this, I aſk'd him how the Glaſſes were fixed in a Camp? He reply'd, without Heſitation, O Madam! the Care our Generals take to pitch our Tents by the Banks of ſome tranſparent Stream, ſerves very well for that Purpoſe. And then he laugh'd moſt egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly for five or ſix Minutes together.</p>
                  <p>You may believe, Madam, from what I have ſaid, that I give no great Encouragement to his Viſits. Yet is there no ſuch thing as getting rid of him; for by all his Conduct, I plainly ſee, he has ſwallow'd the ridiculous Opinion, that the more
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0866800400:266"/>
averſe a Woman appears to a Man's Addreſſes, the more Ground he has to expect Succeſs; and he ſeems ſo aſſured of winning me, that I begin to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, every time he puts his Hand in his Pocket, that he will pull out a Licence and a Ring—If I admit him into my Company, I know not how to get rid of him. If I cauſe myſelf to be deny'd, he plants himſelf directly againſt my Window, that the whole Neighbourhood may know his Buſineſs: Thus, with or without my Conſent, he will be either thought my reigning Admirer, or he will, Don <hi>Quixote</hi> like, have me for his <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> in ſpite of my Teeth.</p>
                  <p>He has three or four times <hi>ſhew'd away</hi> before Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> and, as I cannot forbear heartily laughing at the Airs he gives himſelf, tho' for very different Reaſons from thoſe by which <hi>his</hi> riſible Muſcles are moved, he thinks me pleaſed with him; and, what is more vexatious, Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> thinks ſo too, and grows ſerious and ſullen, as I inſtanc'd in my former.</p>
                  <p>Now, Madam, what can I do? I heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe my Soldier; I greatly regard Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi>'s good Senſe, good Breeding, and other good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: But to forbid this Fop, is what I am ſure will have no Weight with him; for I have as good as done it ſeveral times, and he tells me, he will viſit me whether I will or not, as long as I am unmarried: And to do it profeſſedly in Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> unleſs Matters had gone further between us, is putting myſelf abſolutely in his Power, and declaring myſelf <hi>his,</hi> before he aſks me the Queſtion. So, may I not laugh on a little at the one, and teize the other's cauſeleſs Jealouſy, do you think, till I bring Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> to ſpeak out ſo explicitly, that a Woman of ſome Niceneſs, as I pretend to be, may be in no Danger
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0866800400:267"/>
of miſtaking him? Beſides, I think Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> a little too capricious, and ſhould be glad to break him of it, leſt, if it ever ſhould be our Lot to come together, that Temper ſhould improve upon him; and be more troubleſome from an Huſband, than it is from an humble Servant. I ſhould be glad my Conduct might merit the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſo good a Judge: but if it do not, I will endeavour to conform myſelf to your Advice: For I am, and ever will be, honoured Madam,</p>

                     <salute>Dear <hi>Lydia,</hi>

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR laſt Letter pleaſed me much better than your two former: For your firſt held me in great Suſpenſe; your ſecond gave me Concern for your rigorous Treatment of poor Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> who, 'tis plain, loves you much; but your third confirms me in the Opinion I always entertain'd of your Prudence, in preferring a Man of Senſe to a Coxcomb.</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you, that nothing could give me greater Pleaſure, than to ſee you Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi>'s Bride. His Fortune is good, his Perſon manly and agreeable, and his Behaviour polite. But in my Opinion, you have need of all your Prudence and Caution, to avoid giving him a laſting Diſguſt; for I would have you always remember, my Dear, that nothing can give ſuch Diſlike to a Man of Wiſdom and Diſcernment, as to make him imagine a Fool is preferr'd to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0866800400:268"/>
If Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> did not love you, he would not be jealous of ſuch a Fop as you deſcribe; and it is enough to keep his Paſſions awake, when he ſees you ſo grave and ſo ſevere, as I may ſay, to him, and ſo facetious and chearful with the other. For many a Woman of Senſe, in other reſpects, has been caught by ſome of thoſe ridiculous Airs that ſuch empty Laughers give themſelves; and if you ſhould carry your Jeſt too ſar, it might make him deſpiſe a Levity, as he would be apt to conſtrue it, which he would think unworthy of his Addreſſes.</p>
                  <p>I know it is but too natural to our Sex to love to be admired; but this Humour, when not properly bounded and guarded, has many times coſt us dear, even the Happineſs of all our Lives. Don't be afraid of obliging Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> in a Point ſo material to his Tranquillity, and your own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the forbidding the Viſits of your <hi>Man of Scarlet:</hi> For, as you <hi>intend</hi> not to encourage him, and he has ſo undaunted an Aſſurance, founded on ſo much Folly, I think, if you had no <hi>other</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant, it would not be reputable to receive <hi>this;</hi> much leſs when you have one of ſo different a Caſt, that Light and Darkneſs are not more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite: And a Perſon muſt have a very indifferent Regard to a Man of Merit, who would not give up ſuch a one to his Requeſt; for the very Thought of a Competition with ſuch a Rival, in ſo tender and nice a Point, muſt be diſguſting to a Man of Senſe.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, you know not, my Dear, but Mr. <hi>Ruſhford</hi> may be deterr'd from a formal putting the Queſtion to you, by the Apprehenſion that you ſee his Rival with too much Approbation: For can a Man of his Senſe think of giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up abſolutely to a Perſon who ſeems to waver in her Judgment, which to prefer of two ſuch
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0866800400:269"/>
Competitors? Muſt not the Mind that can heſitate one Moment on ſuch a Deciſion, appear unworthy of the Character of his Wife?</p>
                  <p>And then, as to teizing him for his Jealouſy, and breaking him of it <hi>aforehand,</hi> I doubt this ſavours a little too much of the ungenerous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of ſome of our Sex, who love to tyrannize, when they can. Prudence in a Lady is the beſt Cure of Jealouſy in a Gentleman; and is the Method you propoſe of laughing on with the Captain, and teizing a worthy Man, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly loves you, a Mark of that Prudence?—Indeed, I fear, if you go on thus, you will either loſe Mr. <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> or will be obliged to keep him at the Expence of a Submiſſion (after you have provok'd him) proportionable to the Inſult he will receive; and this, my dear Kinſwoman, will be but little agreeable to the Pride of our <hi>Sex,</hi> and a particular Mortification to your <hi>own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Rule let me give you: That the more obliging you are in the Time of <hi>your Power,</hi> the more it will move a generous Mind to indulge you, in <hi>his;</hi> and the Time you may reckon yours, may not be Three Months in Proportion to Thirty Years of his; or the whole Life. And pray, my Dear, remember, that young Ladies aſſume a Taſk they are very little qualify'd for, when they ſet up <hi>to break Tempers,</hi> and <hi>manage Huſbands,</hi> before they are <hi>married.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Prudence will ſuggeſt to you a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Conduct, I am ſure, to ſecure a worthy Huſband, without my writing a Word more. Eſpecially as I know it will teach you to overcome the little low Pleaſure, which ſome of our Sex take, at your Years, in being admired and flattered, and to conquer the little teizing Pride of perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and torturing the Heart of a worthy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0866800400:270"/>
when we think we have it in our Power. And ſo, hoping ſoon to hear, that you have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the Captain, and are in the way to change the Name of <hi>Fenton</hi> for that of <hi>Ruſhford,</hi> I remain, my dear Niece,</p>

                  <p>'TIS a poor, a very poor Pretence that you make, after what has paſſed between us, that you muſt, in Compliance with the Commands of your <hi>Friends,</hi> break off Acquaintance with me! How often have I adviſed you to this formerly! How often have you vow'd the Impoſſibility of your doing it? How have you, in purſuance of this Avowal, brav'd your Friends, and defy'd their Reſentments, in ſuch a manner, that gave them no Hope of ſucceeding with you! tho' I always blam'd your diſobliging way of doing it, in regard to them, as <hi>your</hi> Relations. But juſt as you had brought them to expect you would not be prevail'd upon, and they had ſo far acquieſced in your Choice, that I had received and returned Viſits from the Principals of your Family, for you poorly to plead their <hi>Menaces,</hi> is ſuch a Jeſt, as is not to be received without Contempt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>

                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0866800400:271"/>
Well, I can <hi>gueſs</hi> at your Motives!—tho' you are too mean-ſpirited to <hi>acknowledge</hi> them, and that they are too mean <hi>to be</hi> acknowledged. Miſs <hi>Holles</hi> can explain them all, by the Help of a larger Fortune than I have! I have heard of your Uncle's Propoſal, and your Viſit there.—Go on, Sir, and welcome! I have Spirit enough to deſpiſe the Man that <hi>could</hi> deceive me.—But could you not, for your <hi>own</hi> ſake act this perfidious Part in a more <hi>manly</hi> and more <hi>worthy</hi> manner? Could you not find a <hi>better</hi> Reaſon than one you had always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, when it was more your <hi>Duty</hi> to obſerve it? But muſt you, when your <hi>Vows</hi> to me had made it your <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with it, then ſhew your Levity in <hi>adhering</hi> to it?

                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Dear,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR kind Concern for my Abſence is very obliging. 'Tis true, I have already out-ſtay'd my Intention by a Week; and I find the Place I am in ſo very engaging, and Mr. <hi>Terry</hi> and his Siſter ſo agreeable, that, but to come to <hi>you,</hi> I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſtay a Month longer with <hi>them.</hi> In ſhort, my Dear, Mr. <hi>Terry</hi> lives juſt as <hi>I</hi> would wiſh to live; and his Siſter, who is his Houſe-keeper, is juſt what I would wiſh <hi>you</hi> to be, in many Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; tho' no one, in my Opinion, can equal you in others.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know then, that Mr. <hi>Terry</hi> and I are quite happy in one another; and when he has no Viſitors, are indulg'd in a very pretty Parlour, which neither Pail nor Mop is permitted to enter for two or three Days together. And when we have Company, the Dining-room is at our Service, and the kind Lady lets us ſmoak there without remarking upon the beaſtly Fumes that we give the Furniture. Not only ſo, but if, by a ſudden Turn of the Pipe, any one of us chances to beſtrew the Floor with burnt Tobacco, we are not broken in upon either by Maid or Broom. And yet no Room can be cleaner than we find that, when we return to it from a Walk in the Gardens.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, I muſt acquaint you, that I never ſaw a Lady more prudently nice than Mrs. <hi>Terry.</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0866800400:273"/>
Her Perſon, Furniture, and Houſe, are even Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Neatneſs and good Oeconomy. I never any-where ſaw the one or the other out-done. Yet how can this be, I marvel!—For I have ſeen her paſs over the Mark of a dirty Shoe-heel, upon a Floor as white as a Curd, and never once rank the Aggreſſor among the worſt of Slovens. Nay, more than that, I have ſeen her Brother drop a few Crums of Bread and Butter under his Feet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as one corrective Frown? Is not this ſtrange, my Dear? Have Batchelors, from a Siſter, more Privileges, than a marry'd Man from his Wife?</p>
                  <p>More than this, (it is true, upon my Honour! incredible as it may ſeem to you) t'other Day he happen'd to ſpill a Glaſs of Claret upon a fine Damaſk Table-cloth, and broke the Glaſs; yet met with no other Reproof than an agreeable Laugh at his Aukwardneſs, and, <hi>It was well it was he that did it, who might do as he pleaſed with his own!.</hi> Oh, what a happy Man, thought I, is this good old Batchelor!</p>
                  <p>But, my Dear, prepare for more ſtrange Things ſtill: Yeſterday, at Dinner, he was cutting up a good fat Gooſe, and, by an unfortunate Splaſh, moſt grievouſly beſpatter'd a rich Gown his Siſter had on. My Heart ached upon this; for, truly, I thought, for a Moment, I was at home. But good Mrs. <hi>Terry</hi> convinced me of the contrary. Oh, Brother, ſaid ſhe, with a Smile, what a Slip was that!—But, Misfortunes will happen!—And out ſhe pulled her Pocket Hankerchief, to wipe her Gown. I am ſorry for it, Siſter, ſaid he. It can't be help'd, return'd ſhe, with a Smile; but I had a good Mind to put you to ſome Expence for this. This was all ſhe ſaid, and ſhe kept her Seat, and eat her Dinner in perfect good Temper; nay, and <hi>look'd</hi> as eaſy and as pleaſant as ſhe ſpoke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0866800400:274"/>
I muſt ſtill further obſerve, that, tho' all Things here are conducted with the greateſt Decorum, and every Servant in the Houſe knows their Duty, and does it diſtinguiſhingly well, yet I have never heard one high or angry Word paſs between Mrs. <hi>Terry</hi> and the Maids. Is not this ſurpriſing, my Dear? What can it be owing to? I thought, for my Share, ſo much have I been uſed to a <hi>contrary</hi> Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no Servant could do their Duty, unleſs the Miſtreſs of the Family put herſelf out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with all the Houſe. Either ſhe is more fortunate than you, in lighting of good Servants; or, perhaps, as Perſecution makes Schiſmaticks in the Church, ſo finding Faults creates them in a Family. There may be ſomething in this, my Dear; for I have ſeen your Maid <hi>Jane</hi> blunder, out of <hi>Fear;</hi> and blunder a ſecond time, to find ſhe <hi>had</hi> blunder'd; and a third, becauſe ſhe was put quite out, and could not help it.—Then how has my poor Deary been diſcompoſed! How have her charming Features been even diſtorted with Paſſion! not a Bit of the Lily in her Face; for the crimſon Roſe had ſwallowed it all up; and an Eye darting Flames of Indignation and Woe mixed together! And then, breaking Silence, Nobody ever had ſuch Torments of Servants as I have! Alas! poor Deary! How hard is thy Hap!—How much happier this good Family! For, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of an Excuſe, rather than Blame, if a ſmall Fault ſhould be committed, in comes each Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as their Duty requires, all ſerene, pleaſed, chearful, as their Miſtreſs. Their Eye is fixed upon her Eye, with a becoming Confidence of pleaſing; and a Nod, or a Beck, does more with them, than an hundred Words.</p>
                  <p>How can I, my Dear, think of leaving ſuch a delightful Houſe and Family as this?—Yet I long
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0866800400:275"/>
to ſee my beloved Spouſe; and I will ſet out on <hi>Monday</hi> next for that Purpoſe, with as great Delight as ever I knew, ſince I had the Happineſs to call you mine. But pray, my dear Love, let what I have ſaid, without the leaſt Deſign to offend or concern you, a little impreſs you, however. Let me have the Satisfaction, for <hi>both</hi> our ſakes, of ſeeing you get over ſome of thoſe Foibles, that make us as effectually unhappy, at times, as if we had ſubſtantial Evils to encounter with. In ſhort, my Dear, let us think the Houſe made for <hi>our</hi> Uſe, and not we for <hi>that.</hi> And let us ſhew our Servants, that while we would have them <hi>leſs faulty</hi> than they are, we will, ourſelves, try to be <hi>more perfect</hi> than we have hitherto been; and not, while we condemn their Failings, be guilty of much greater.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice, Prudence, Eaſe, Pleaſure, Intereſt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, all require this of us: And could I hope what I have written will be attended to, as I wiſh and mean it, you cannot conceive the Delight that will double upon me on my Return to my Deareſt; for it is my Pride, that I can ſtyle my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I MUST, for once, poſtpone every thing I would ſay to you, in order to make room for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you little expect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0866800400:276"/>
What will you ſay, when I tell you, that a current Report of my being <hi>immenſely rich</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Misfortune</hi> I at preſent labour under? Nor do I find it ſo ſupportable as you may be apt to imagine. The Occaſion was owing to the frequent Slights I had received from the Gentlewoman with whom I lodge, and from others of my Friends, who, believing that I lived up to my ſcanty Fortune, as in Truth I do, (tho' I take care to be beholden to nobody, and pay ready Money for every thing) could not treat me negligently enough. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of this to that arch Wag <hi>Tony Richards,</hi> who told me, he would change every one's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to me in a few Days. And he has done it effectually: For what does he do, but, as a kind of Secret, acquaints my Landlady, that beſide my poor little Eſtate (which you know to be my All) he had lately diſcovered, that I had Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds Stock in one of our great Companies!</p>
                  <p>Such was the Force of his whimſical Deluſion, that, the very next Morning, I had a clean Towel hung over my Water-bottle, tho' I never before had more than one a Week during the Twenty Years I have lodged here.</p>
                  <p>About a Week after this, my Couſin <hi>Tom,</hi> who, for the two Years he has been in the <hi>Temple,</hi> has let me ſee him but three times, came, in a moſt complaiſant manner, plainer dreſſed than ever I had before ſeen him; and begg'd, if the Length of the Evening was in any Degree burdenſome, I would permit him to wait upon me with ſuch Pieces of Wit, Humour, or Entertainment, as the Town afforded; the reading of which under <hi>my</hi> Ear, he was ſure, would be a great Advantage to <hi>him;</hi> and aſſured me, that, for a Beginning, he had preſumed to bring the laſt new Tragedy in his Pocket: I thank'd my young Spark. Upon which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0866800400:277"/>
he is ſo much in earneſt in his Obſervances, that three Nights in a Week he thus entertains me: Which will at leaſt be of ſo much Service, as to keep him out of more expenſive Company. And you cannot think what Pains the Rogue takes to read with the Cadence he knows I admire, and ſits till his Teeth chatter before he offers to look towards the Fire.</p>
                  <p>What you will ſtill more wonder at, Sir <hi>John Hookhim</hi> called upon me before <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> and tho' I have not had a Viſit from him theſe Five Years, was ſo obliging, as to run away with me in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot into <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> to keep the Holidays in his Family; where his Lady treated me with the utmoſt Reſpect, and her Daughters paid me their Morning Devoirs, with the ſame Deference as if I had been their Grand Papa. No Dinner was concluded upon, without conſulting my Palate; and the young Gentlemen, his Sons, are as ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of my hearing their Exerciſes, as if their Fortunes depended upon my Approbation.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> acquainted me with every Improvement he had made in his Eſtate, and aſſured me, that his ſecond Son <hi>Will.</hi> my Nameſake, has a Genius ſingularly turned for managing Country Buſineſs, had he not had the Misfortune of having a Brother born before him; and gave me ſeveral Reaſons to believe, that a fine Eſtate, which lay in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and was then to be ſold, would be a great Pennyworth. I took the Hint; but ſaid, I had no Inclination to purchaſe: He ſhook his Head at my Thouſands, and told me, that, in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, a Land Eſtate was preferable to the beſt Stock in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>When I came to Town the 4th of <hi>January,</hi> I was no ſooner out of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Chariot, but my Landlady, in Perſon, informed me, that ſince I
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0866800400:278"/>
had been abſent, I had ſo many Preſents ſent me, that ſhe had been in an hundred Fears for their ſpoiling: I aſked her the Particulars, and found Five Turkeys, Three Chines, Three Hampers of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira</hi> for the Gout, Two Collars of Brawn, Geeſe, Chickens, Hares, and Wild-fowl, to a large Amount.</p>
                  <p>At Night I was welcom'd to Town by all my <hi>old</hi> Acquaintance, and about Twenty almoſt new ones: I was a little tired with my Journey; and had a ſlight Cold beſides; which being obſerved, one was running for a Phyſician, another for a Surgeon, to bleed me: One thought an Emetick not improper: Another recommended a gentle Sweat, or compoſing Draught; and, amidſt the general Officiouſneſs, I could hear it whiſper'd, that if my Will was not made, Delays might prove dangerous: And, in the Morning, five Meſſengers after my Welfare arrived before Day.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee my Peace is gone, my Tongue is of no Uſe; for no one believes me, when I declare my real Circumſtances: And, under the Happineſs of a very ſmall Fortune, I ſuffer all the Afflictions attending a Man immoderately rich; and if <hi>you</hi> keep not your uſual Behaviour, I ſhall not know myſelf, nor any Man elſe; ſince all my Companions are become Flatterers, and all around me are ſo obſequious, that it is impoſſible for me to know when I do right or wrong. I am, dear Sir, tho' thus whimſically ſituated,</p>

                     <salute>My dear Brother.</salute>

                  <p>I AM exceedingly concerned for the raſh Step your Daughter <hi>Thomaſin</hi> has made: I know how it muſt affect you, and I am myſelf not a little troubled at it. But we ſee how unfit we are to chuſe for ourſelves! And, oh! how often are we puniſhed by the Enjoyment of our own Wiſhes!—You ſay, you would rather have follow'd her Corpſe to the Grave, than that ſhe ſhould have thus thrown herſelf away on a Rake, a Prodigal, a Sot, and a Fool, as I, as well as you, know to be the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Perſon ſhe has choſen. I would not afflict you, my dear Brother, inſtead of pouring Balm on the Wounds of your Mind. But you will remember, that it is ſcarce two Years ago, when you were no leſs anxiouſly diſturbed on Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the violent Fever, which then endangered her Life. What Vows did you not put up for her Recovery! What Tumults of Grief then agitated your afflicted Mind! And how do you know, that then ſhe was only reſtor'd at your inceſſant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Prayers; but that otherwiſe, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, knowing what was beſt for you both, would have taken her away from this heavy Evil! This ſhould teach us Reſignation to the Divine Will, and that we are moſt unfit to chuſe for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And even this Affliction, heavy as it is, may be ſent, in order to wean you from a Delight that you had too much ſet your Heart upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0866800400:280"/>
Mean time, you muſt not, by too violent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and Reprobation of her, which I find you are reſolv'd upon, add to the Miſeries ſhe has choſen. The poor Creature, will, I fear, too ſoon find her Puniſhment in her Choice; and already, I underſtand, ſhe is driven to great Diſtreſs. You know ſhe has ſtrong Paſſions, and your too great Severity may precipitate her on her everlaſting Ruin, when ſhe becomes thoroughly ſenſible of the Condition ſhe has brought herſelf to, from as happy Proſpects as any young Lady could promiſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Let this prevail upon you to allow her Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for, oh! 'tis a ſad thing for meagre Want to ſtare in the Face a young Creature uſed to the fulleſt Plenty! eſpecially when 'tis aggravated by the Reflection, that it is all owing to her own Raſhneſs. And as it may not ſuit with your Liking, to appear yourſelf to allow her any thing, at leaſt till you ſee what Uſe will be made of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I will undertake, as from myſelf, and on my own Head, to furniſh, if you pleaſe, what is immediately neceſſary; and from time to time give you a faithful Account of the Diſpoſition in which ſhe receives it, and how her wretched De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luder is affected by it.</p>
                  <p>This is a Taſk I ſhould not be fond of, but to prevent worſe Conſequences; and I muſt intreat you, Brother, to weigh ſeriouſly the Matter; and as you <hi>abound,</hi> let not the unhappy Wretch, who, after all, is your Daughter, want thoſe <hi>Neceſſaries of Life,</hi> which all your <hi>Servants</hi> have in ſuch Plenty.</p>
                  <p>I could not bear to be a Witneſs of the great Griefs, which muſt tear aſunder your Heart, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling between paternal Affection, and juſt Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which makes me chuſe to write to you;

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the Divine Will, a noble, a needful Leſſon! is the Doctrine you raiſe from it. God give it me, as I ought to have it. Time and His Grace, I hope, will effect it. But at preſent—Oh! Brother! you know not how I ſet my Heart on this Wretch. That was my <hi>Crime,</hi> you'll ſay: And 'tis but juſt it ſhould be my <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> Do you, as you pleaſe, in what you propoſe. I deſire not the ingrateful Creature ſhould want, yet let her too be pinch'd: Nothing elſe will make her ſenſible of her great Offence—But don't let her be precipitated on any worſe Fate, if a worſe can be poſſible, as it <hi>may</hi> with regard to another Life. Yet let not her Seducer be the better for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. He ſhall never riot in my Subſtance. Let me know what you have done three Months hence; that I may retrench, or add to what you ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as I ſhall ſee her Behaviour. I ſay in three Months, for another Reaſon: becauſe I may by that time, I hope, get more Strength of Mind and Patience, than at preſent poſſeſſes the Heart of</p>

                     <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOUR Lot, I confeſs, is hard, exceeding hard, to loſe ſo promiſing and ſo hopeful a Child as that dear Boy was, who ſo much engroſſed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of yourſelf and Spouſe: and a ſuitable Grief on ſo trying an Occaſion ought to be indulged. But yet not ſo, as if you were bereft of <hi>all</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and inſenſible to thoſe <hi>other</hi> great Mercies, which God has beſtowed upon you. This, my dear Friend, would be a ſinful Rejection of thoſe Bleſſings which remain to you, as if, like <hi>froward</hi> Children, you would have <hi>nothing,</hi> becauſe you could not have <hi>every thing</hi> you wiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>Look upon all the great Families of the Earth, upon all your Neighbours round you; and ſee if they have not almoſt every one ſhed. Tears on this very Occaſion, and then judge of the Unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of <hi>too great</hi> a Grief, and what Pretenſion you have to be exempted from thoſe Accidents, to which <hi>Royalty</hi> itſelf is liable. I will not, to alleviate your Grief, remind you of a Topick, which is however no leſs important than too frequently the Caſe, that he <hi>might not always</hi> have been ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but might, as he <hi>grew up,</hi> many ways have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered Bitterneſs to you. But I think it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all other Comforts, even thoſe you hoped for from him, that he is taken away at an Age, at which God's Mercy renders his eternal Happineſs unqueſtionably certain; and you and your mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spouſe have the Pleaſure to reflect, that ye have been the happy Means of adding <hi>one</hi> to the Number of the Bleſt above; and that he is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, but a little while, to that Place, where
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0866800400:283"/>
all Tears ſhall be wiped away, and whither, thro' the ſame infinite Mercy, you will in time follow him, and enjoy him for ever.</p>
                  <p>You have this Comfort, that he dy'd a <hi>natural</hi> Death; that the Work was God Almighty's, who <hi>gave</hi> him to you, and has but <hi>taken</hi> back what he <hi>lent</hi> you: That you ſaw every thing done for his Recovery, that <hi>could</hi> be done; and that it pleaſed God <hi>not</hi> to grant him to your Prayers; and why ſhould you repine at the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> when you know the <hi>Diſpenſer?</hi> Let it therefore be your Duty, on this trying Occaſion, to ſhew an intire Acquieſcence to the Divine Will; ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence as may be exemplary to your good Spouſe, whoſe <hi>weaker</hi> Sex and Mind want all the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation your <hi>ſtronger</hi> Reaſon can give her. And at the ſame time, it behoves you to ſhew a thankful Spirit for the Mercies <hi>yet continued</hi> to you, (Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that Thouſands have not to rejoice in!) leſt God Almighty ſhould, as a Puniſhment, deprive you of thoſe you have ſtill left.</p>

                  <head>LETTER CLXXII. To a Father on the Loſs of a hopeful Son, who died at Man's Eſtate.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM truly ſorry for your Loſs. So hopeful a Son juſt arrived at Man's Eſtate, and who was ſo great a Comfort and Aſſiſtance to you, to be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0866800400:284"/>
ſnatched away, is what muſt adminiſter to you the greateſt Grief of any thing that could poſſibly befal you.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! yours is no <hi>new</hi> Caſe. The greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies have been thus afflicted, and with the Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to ſome of them, that perhaps they have been deprived of their <hi>Heirs,</hi> and have not a <hi>Son left</hi> to continue their Name and Honours. The late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> when Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> loſt her beloved Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> not only <hi>her</hi> Hopes, but the Hopes of the <hi>Nation;</hi> and the Crown, to which he ſeem'd not only <hi>born,</hi> but <hi>faſhioned,</hi> was obliged to be ſettled, on that Occaſion, upon a diſtant Branch of the Royal Line.</p>
                  <p>The great Duke of MARLBOROUGH, who by his Merit, and his Victories, had raiſed a princely Eſtate, as well as Titles, had but one Son, the Marquis of <hi>Blandford,</hi> on whom he and his Ducheſs built all their Hopes, for the perpetuating of thoſe new Honours in their Family; and he was ſnatched away by Death, when he was at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, training up to become the Dignities, to which he was intitled.</p>
                  <p>Still more recent was the unhappy Fate of a Lady of the firſt Quality in <hi>England.</hi> Her Lord had a Son lent to his advanced Years. This Son was the laſt of that noble Family, and on his Life depended all his Father's and his Mother's Hopes; and on his living till of Age, a valuable Part of the Eſtate itſelf, which otherwiſe was to fall to an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Offspring. What Care was not uſed to preſerve the noble Youth! An eminent Phyſician was taken into the Family, to be made a conſtant Watchman, as it were, over his Health and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. The young Nobleman himſelf was hopeful, dutiful, and as diſtinguiſhed in the Graces of his Mind, as by his Birth. He travelled; his indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Mother travelled with him: He made a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0866800400:285"/>
under his Uncle, the greateſt General then ſurviving in an Age of Generals. He again travelled to reſtore and confirm his Health, and all the noble Mother's Hopes and Views were employ'd on the finding for her beloved Son, on his Return, a Wife ſuitable to his Quality, and who might be a Means to preſerve one of the firſt Families in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from utter Extinction.</p>
                  <p>What was the Event of all her Cares, her Hopes, her Vows, her Proſpects?—Why, juſt as the young Nobleman had (within a few Months) arrived at Age, and could have made thoſe Family Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were moſt deſirable ſhould be made, and the Want of which involved his noble Mother in perplexing Law-ſuits, which, too, turn'd againſt her; it pleaſed God to deprive her of him, and he died in a foreign Land, far diſtant from his fond Mother; who, (ſtill more grievous, if true!) for Reaſons of State, as was ſaid, had been deny'd to accompany and attend him; and ſo ended all her Hopes of above twenty Years ſtanding, and in him his Family likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſtill more recent Calamity to a great Family, I might mention; in the Death of two hopeful Children, the only Sons of their Father, and the only Heirs Male of one of the firſt Families in the Kingdom, both ſnatch'd away, in the Space of a few Hours of one another, from healthy Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and no Ailments previous to the ſudden one that carry'd them off, which was only believed to be a ſore Throat. In vain were the Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the moſt eminent Phyſicians and Surgeons, who gave Attendance all Night, minutely to watch every Change of the Diſtemper; in vain prov'd the Aſſurance of the Skilful to the fond Parents, that there was no Danger. Death mocked all their Hopes; and when the firſt dy'd, in vain was he opened, in order to find out, if poſſible, the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0866800400:286"/>
Cauſe of the fatal Malady, in order to adminiſter, with greater Hopes of Succeſs, Remedies againſt it, to preſerve the other. That other hopeful Youth followed his Brother, and their Fate deeply wounded the Hearts of half a dozen noble Families, whoſe intimate Relationſhip gave them a very near Intereſt in the awful Event.</p>
                  <p>Like Inſtances of the Loſs of hopeful Sons, and of the only Male Heirs, might be produced in other Families of prime Diſtinction in the Liſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility; but I need not enumerate more to a Mind conſiderate as yours, which will reflect that Death is a common Lot, from which no Rank or Degree is exempted. And I hope theſe Reflections, and ſuch as you will be able to add to them, by your own Reaſon and Piety, will ſerve to rebuke the Overflowings of your Grief, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to the natural Channels, into which both God and Nature will <hi>indulge</hi> it to flow.</p>
                  <p>I mention not to your enlighten'd Mind, you ſee, the Motives, that, nevertheleſs, might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on with great Propriety, on ſo grievous an Occaſion; ſuch as, The Uncertainty of Life: The Gratitude you ought to ſhew for having had your Son <hi>ſo long</hi> continu'd to you, as he was: The great Probability of his being happy in God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, by reaſon of his Hopefulneſs and Duty: The <hi>early</hi> Releaſe he has met with from the Troubles and Chances of a changeable and tranſitory Life: His Eſcape from the Danger of the Temptations which his Virtue might have been tried with, had he lived to <hi>maturer</hi> Years: That this your Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is God's Work: That he dy'd not in a diſtant Land, and by an untimely Death: But that you had the Satisfaction of knowing that every thing was done for him that could be done: That his Morals were ſtill untainted, and he was not cut off in the Purſuit of ſome capital Sin, as has too
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0866800400:287"/>
often been the Caſe with bold and daring Spirits in the Heat of their youthful Paſſions: And that he eſcap'd the Snares uſually laid for young Men by idle Companions, and vicious Women, which too often entangle and catch the unthinking Mind. Theſe will be all ſuggeſted to you from your own better Reaſon; and to that <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> as to a due Reſignation to the Divine Will <hi>primarily,</hi> let me reſer you, on this trying Occaſion: Who am, with a ſympathizing Affection, dear Sir,</p>

                  <p>ALLOW me the Liberty of condoling with you on the truly great and heavy Loſs you have ſuſtain'd of an excellent Huſband. All we, who had the Pleaſure of his Friendſhip, mourn with you, the irretrievable Misfortune to <hi>us</hi> as well as to <hi>you.</hi> But as there is no recalling it, and as it is God's doing, we muſt not repine at the Diſpenſation, but acquieſce in it. And yet to ſay, that neither you nor we ought to grieve for it, would be abſurd and unnatural. Sinful Grief, however, we are commanded to ſhun: And we ought to bleſs God, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to continue him with us <hi>ſo long,</hi> inſtead of mourning too heavily, that we had not <hi>longer</hi> the Pleaſure of his agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. We were not <hi>born</hi> together, and ſome of us <hi>muſt</hi> have <hi>gone firſt;</hi> and I have ſometimes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0866800400:288"/>
been ready to think, (beſides the Life of Glory, that, thro' God's Mercies, awaits the Good) that he is far happier, than thoſe he leaves behind him, in this Point, That he is ſaved from the Regret (which fills the wounded Hearts of his ſurviving Friends) of ſeeing them go <hi>before him,</hi> as they have ſeen him go <hi>before them.</hi> Had he not dy'd now, a few Years would have determin'd his uſeful Life; for the longeſt Life is but a Span; and <hi>then</hi> the Matter, had he gone before us, would have been as it is <hi>now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may make our own Lives miſerable in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing <hi>his Loſs;</hi> but we cannot do <hi>him</hi> good, nor (were <hi>he</hi> to <hi>know</hi> it) <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> You, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Madam, who are now called upon to be both <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> to the dear Pledges of your mutual Affection, ought to take double Care, how you ſuffer immoderate Grief to incapacitate you from this new, and more arduous and neceſſary Taſk. For by this means, you would not only do yourſelf Hurt, but double the Loſs which his dear Children have already ſuſtain'd in that of their Father. And would you, Madam, make them <hi>motherleſs</hi> as well as <hi>fatherleſs?</hi>—God forbid! Conſider, tho' this is a <hi>heavy</hi> Caſe, yet it is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Caſe. And we muſt not repine, that God Almighty thought him <hi>ripe</hi> for Heaven, and put an End to his <hi>probatory</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>With melancholy Pleaſure have I often, on the Loſs of Friends, contemplated the excellent Advice of the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> who tells us how we ought to <hi>mourn</hi> on theſe Occaſions, and how we ought to govern our Mourning; and reminds us moſt excellently, that while we are grieving for our departed Friends, <hi>our own Lives</hi> paſs away, and we <hi>are not.</hi> You'll permit me to tranſcribe his own excellent Words, as moſt ſuitable to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us.</p>

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0866800400:289"/>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My Son, ſays he, let Tears fall down over the Dead, and begin to lament; and then cover his Body according to the Cuſtom, and neglect not his Burial. Weep bitterly, and make great Moan, and uſe Lamentation as he is <hi>worthy</hi>—and then comfort thyſelf for thy Heavineſs; for of Heavineſs cometh <hi>Death;</hi> and the Heavineſs of the <hi>Heart</hi> breaketh <hi>Strength.</hi> In Affliction alſo Sorrow remaineth; and the Life of the Poor [or Miſerable, or of thoſe who make themſelves ſo by Mourning] is the <hi>Curſe of the Heart.</hi> Take [therefore] no Heavineſs to Heart: Drive it away; and remember [<hi>thy own</hi>] laſt End.

                  <p>To add any thing to this excellent Advice, would be, in ſome meaſure, to depreciate it.
