            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS TO THE WHIG CLUB.</head>
            <p>IN your integrity and abilities the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide for protection, juſtice, and redreſs. Upon the principles on which you have aſſociated, they reſt their hopes. They expect from your virtue, ſpirit, and perſeverance, not only the preſervation of their rights, lately reſcued from an uſurped and foreign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, but the perfection of their further claims, by removing that corruption which has contaminated every department of the State; which has tainted even the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate offices, which has encreaſed and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0151400300:4"/>
is encreaſing under the dictates of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Miniſter, for the evident purpoſe of repelling the generous energies of liberty.</p>
            <p>Next to the law of religion, the law of the land ſhould be the principal ſtudy with a free people. A knowledge of the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as eſſential to their temporal intereſts as a knowledge of the other is to their eternal happineſs. Wilful ignorance will neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the ſoul before the tribunal of the creator, nor the perſon before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of the conſtitution. To diffuſe legal information is the purpoſe of this eſſay: it is not written to acquire fame— It is written to meet the approbation of the underſtanding, not to amuſe the fancy, and you will attend to it, from reſpect; to the ſubject on which it treats.</p>
            <p>It is not in ornaments that the merit of an argument conſiſts. In viewing a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, the figure and features are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal objects of contemplation; nor can the moſt elegant drapery, or beautiful colouring pleaſe the minds eye, where the artiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0151400300:5"/>
from nature and truth. The intent will excuſe in your minds, the blemiſhes of the performance. The opinions, if not expreſſed, are conceived in the ardor of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm; in diſintereſted love for a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where the writer received that life, which he thinks can only be well ſpent in its ſervice.</p>
            <p>The writer ſhould conſider himſelf puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous, and contemptible indeed, if in the preſent conteſt between the friends of his country, and the purchaſed dependants of the Britiſh miniſter, he withheld the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contribution of knowledge, that his ſtudies have afforded him. This is an aera, where every honeſt hand, every honeſt heart, and every honeſt head, ſhould unite their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, and with "a long pull, a ſtrong pull, and a pull all together," level to the earth that rotten fabric, where deſpotiſm holds private counſel with corruption, for the treacherous purpoſe of ſapping, and overturning the nobleſt conſtitution that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ever framed, or freedom ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0151400300:6"/>The authority delegated by the people to their repreſentatives in parliament, has now reverted to its original poſſeſſors. This then is the time, they ſhould be informed how that truſt has been executed, that they may know who has deſerved their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, who has merited their cenſure and reſentment.</p>
            <p>Meaſures militating with the liberty of the ſubject, have been carried into effect by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal majorities. Every propoſition brought forward to diminiſh undue influence, to eſtabliſh oecomy, to ſecure the revenue, to vindicate the law, and to eaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have been negatived by the ſame cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect power. Oppreſſion has experienced im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, the injured have been denied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and the authority of law and ſound reaſon, has been trampled upon by the aggregate force of numbers. This then is the time when conſtitutional knowledge ſhould be deſeminated through the land, when the principles of legiſlation and law ſhould be made known to the people at large.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0151400300:7"/>This is the time when men, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the intereſts of their country, who are not equally inſenſible to the value of their own honour, and the good of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, following the glorious example of your aſſociation, ſhould with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, promote the ſpirit of liberty, till every heart pervaded by that divine eſſence, which expands the underſtanding, and elates the mind, even of the meaneſt peaſant, vibrates with ardour and pants to ſpring forth the guardian of thoſe principles, which emanate from the boſom of God!—The protector of thoſe laws, which are derived from the immutable decrees of the eternal code, laid down by providence, and delivered to man at the creation!</p>
            <p>The moment has ſcarcely paſſed ſince the people of Ireland demanded and acquired the reſtitution of their rights, with arms in their hands.—They have laid down their arms, and their rights are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. Where then are they to find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection? They can only inſure it by a ſtrict and firm adherence to thoſe reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0151400300:8"/>
which you have formed for their political creed. Let the people zealouſly ſupport the doctrines you have promulged; let them not tamely ſit down ſatisfied with the melancholy privilege of complaint; let them prove by their ſpirit in the face of heaven and of the world, that by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever right Engliſhmen poſſeſs freedom, by the ſame right, Iriſhmen, and all mankind may claim it.</p>
            <p>The greateſt and moſt diſtinguiſhing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of mankind is the immortality of his ſoul; and we find the ſtrongeſt evidence of that immortality in the freedom of his mind, which includes the right of declaring all our thoughts! In this free-will, derived from God, originated the liberty of the preſs, that ſacred medium through which every freeman, who poſſeſſes the bleſſing, has a right to declare his opinions on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic men, and on public meaſures. Every unneceſſary reſtraint of the preſs, being then a reſtraint of the free will of man, is an act of tyranny. By ſuppreſſing the exerciſe of intellectual liberty, ſlavery has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed—by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0151400300:9"/>
giving it fair ſcope freedom has been reſtored. The hiſtories of nations are illuſtrations of this poſition, and recent proofs are to be found in the fears of Spain and Portugal—in the ſpirit of America and France—in the revolutions of Great Baitain and Ireland.</p>
            <p>Then let the preſs exert her powers. Notwithſtanding the reſtraints lately laid on her natural vigour, ſhe ſtill retains ſufficient ſtrength to drag before the people thoſe puſillanimous, corrupt, and abdicating cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prits, who, deſerting from the ſtandard of freedom, have enliſted with proſtituted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, and war againſt common ſenſe, and the law of the land.</p>
            <p>The preſs ſtill retains ſufficient ability to hunt from their lurking places, and ſcourge into ſhame and repentance, thoſe adulating and degenerate monſters, who point out to every alien plunderer, the ſecret ſprings, the honey, and the treaſures of the land; who have entered into conſpiracies with ſtrangers, againſt its legal owners, and who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0151400300:10"/>
have ſtripped the laborious peaſant, and the induſtrious manufacturer, of their fruits and earnings.</p>
            <p>This is the moment to bring about poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reformation, for extirpating venality—and the preſs is the moſt effectual means: Was the <hi>conſtitution</hi> ſubverted, and <hi>tyranny</hi> ſeated on her throne, ſurrounded by her ſycophants, her paraſites, her informers, her guards, her aſſaſſins, and her executioners, a free preſs would <hi>reſtore</hi> the one and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> the other.</p>

            <head>THE ESSAY.</head>
            <p>IT may be objected, that this eſſay is ill-timed; as tending to influence the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſuits now pending; but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is erroneous: The queſtions are not of <hi>law</hi> but of <hi>fact.</hi> The determinations lie with <hi>juries</hi> not with <hi>judges.</hi> The inquiries on the trials will be merely, whether the defendant be <hi>guilty</hi> or not <hi>guilty</hi> of the injury laid in the declaration, and if <hi>guilty,</hi> what <hi>damages</hi> the plaintiffs have ſuſtained. The arguing <hi>points of law</hi> is at all times legal, and the points herein diſcuſſed, are in every reſpect irrelevant to the merits of the iſſues which the juries are to try. Any man as <hi>amicus curiae</hi> may inform a judge on a <hi>point of law,</hi> but no man ſhall give information to a jury on a fact, unleſs he be a witneſs previouſly ſworn. Earl Mansfield ſome years ago pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the publication of evidence given
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0151400300:12"/>
againſt priſoners on examinations before juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the peace, becauſe the evidence being exparte, the publiſhing of it tended to create an influence againſt the priſoner, which might be injurious to him on trial; but no judge ever yet aſſerted that animadverting on matters of law was illegal, and yet in the caſe of general warrants, the preſs teemed with legal diſquiſitions.</p>
            <p>The cauſes for promulging the law of the land, on the diſcretion of judges in granting fiats, and on bail, having originated in the ſuits carried on againſt Magee, the printer, it will be frequently neceſſary to advert to them. In doing this, however, it is not intended to ſtigmatize with invective, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere imputations, the proſecutors or plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs. The law gives a remedy for every injury, and if they ſuffered, or imagined they ſuffered wrong, they had an unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable right to ſeek redreſs from the laws of their country.</p>
            <p>Magee, conſidered as a private individual, is equally an object of indifference. This
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0151400300:13"/>
eſſay neither takes into conſideration his guilt, nor his innocence, that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of a jury; but the proceedings againſt him, are of the moſt ſerious concern to the people; every individual, of whom are entitled to inquire, whether his own rights and liberties have been attacked in the perſon of his fellow citizen, under the ſanction of a proceſs, iſſuing from a court of law, which, by its inſtitution, is the guardian and protector of thoſe rights and liberties.</p>
            <p>The honour of the laws of Ireland, its judges, and its profeſſors, is alſo materially involved in the ultimate deciſion upon theſe proceedings. The Engliſh bar have treated them with contempt and reprobation. It is at this day a common obſervation in Weſtminſter-Hall, that "Ireland will ſoon repent the loſs of writs of error and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the courts of England." Muſt not the pride and ſenſibility of Iriſhmen, ſuffer to the quick from the fallacious ſlander, thus indiſcriminately thrown upon all the judges, and all the barriſters of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0151400300:14"/>
And muſt not theſe ſufferings be aggravated in the minds of thoſe who know, that unſullied purity, extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and great ability, have ever been found at the Iriſh bar? That the bench is radiated by ſacred worth, ſpirit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence? That the law is promulged by judges of inflexible integrity, united with intelligent minds, fortified by invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible virtue, and diſpiſing with equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thoſe accommodating fears, which ſometimes give temporary popularity, and thoſe mean pliabilities, which bow and cringe with implicit obedience, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of every adminiſtration?</p>
            <p>Under the torture of thoſe ſufferings, the writer of this eſſay with ſedulous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſearched the records and repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the law, for precedent or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon which he could juſtify, excuſe, or even palliate thoſe proceedings, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated in England.</p>
            <p>What was the conſequence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0151400300:15"/>He found that the opinions of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh lawyers, ſo far as they reſpected ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts by fiat, in caſes of libels, were well grounded; and, to his great ſatisfaction, he is now convinced that the Iriſh bar, and every independent member of the Iriſh houſe of commons, maintain the ſame doctrine, and have thereby vindicated the juriſprudence of their country, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practice of their courts from wanton and raſh aſperſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe extraordinary proceedings, thus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally condemned, of courſe appeared to him as raſh and alarming innovations on the indubitable rights of the people. They appeared to him as grievances, ſpringing from latent motives, and tending either to oppreſs private individuals, or to eſtabliſh precedents for the purpoſe of coercing the liberty of the preſs, an object that has been repeatedly attempted, and too often with ſucceſs, ſince Mr. Pitt has been placed at the head of the Britiſh adminiſtration, though no miniſter was ever ſupported by a more licentious abuſe of his opponents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0151400300:16"/>
               <hi>The Caſe of</hi> MAGEE, <hi>is this,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has been arreſted on fiats, or judges warrants, and held to ſpecial bail in ſeveral actions, brought againſt him for publiſhing libels on private individuals; and he has been held to bail in the following ſums—four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds—eight hundred pounds—one thouſand pounds—and two thouſand pounds, making in the whole, the ſum of ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eight hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Now as each bondſman muſt ſwear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when juſtifying his bail, worth double the ſum for which he becomes bound, the bail demanded amounts to thirty-one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred pounds! and this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate defendant is a private ſubject—the printer of a newſpaper!</p>
            <p>Two queſtions reſult from this caſe:</p>
            <p>FIRST—<hi>Were the arreſts legal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0151400300:17"/>SECOND—<hi>If the arreſts were legal—was the ſpecial bail demanded of the defendant legal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to theſe queſtions it has been aſſerted—</p>
            <p>That the right of granting a fiat is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>diſcretionary power</hi> of the judge: And,</p>
            <p>That the <hi>quantum</hi> of bail demanded is within the ſame <hi>diſcretionary power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore the purport of this eſſay to ſhew, that the charges exhibited againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant being for libels, and the objects of the imputed calumnies private individuals, the interference of a judge, by fiat, in ſuch caſes, is <hi>unprecedented,</hi> the ſpecial bail de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the defendant <hi>exceſſive;</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe acts of the judge are within the rules of <hi>legal diſcretion,</hi> and that they are both <hi>contrary to the</hi> LAW OF THE LAND.</p>
            <p>The granting of fiats, in any caſe, being diſcretionary, the firſt point to be diſcuſſed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0151400300:18"/>
is the nature, and legal extent of that power.</p>
            <p>LORD COKE defines <hi>diſcretion</hi> thus—It is, ſays that learned juriſt, to diſcern between right and wrong, ſhadows and ſubſtance, equity and colourable gloſſes, and not to do according to our <hi>will</hi> and private <hi>affections;</hi> and ſuch diſcretion is to be <hi>limitted</hi> and <hi>bounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Inſt. 56.</note> Therefore, whoever hath power to act at <hi>diſcretion</hi> is bound by the rule of <hi>reaſon</hi> and law. <note place="margin">2 Inſt. 298.</note> For <hi>juſtices</hi> muſt remember that it is <hi>legal diſcretion,</hi> in which, in <hi>favour of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> great <hi>tenderneſs</hi> is to be uſed,—And though there be a latitude of diſcretion given to one, <note place="margin">Hob. 158.</note> yet he is <hi>circumſcribed</hi> that what he does be <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> without which no liberty, no claim to juriſdiction can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons when the law leaves any thing, to any perſon, to be done according to his <hi>diſcretion,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Lit. ab. 477.</note> the law intends it muſt be done with <hi>ſound diſcretion</hi> and <hi>according to</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0151400300:19"/>
               <hi>law.</hi> And the COURT OF KING'S BENCH hath a power to redreſs things that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done, notwithſtanding that they are left to the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of thoſe who do them.</p>
            <p>The ſuperintending power which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution thus repoſes in the court of king's bench, does not, however, authoriſe the judges of that court to exerciſe an <hi>uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diſcretion</hi> over the perſonal liberty of the ſubject. The reſtrictive rules of <hi>legal diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> are as binding on the chief-juſtice and his brethren, whether acting collectively, or individually as on any ſubordinate magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate; they are as ſtrictly binding on judges in courts of law, as principles and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are binding on the chancellor, or the barons of the exchequer in the courts of equity.</p>
            <p>If <hi>diſcretion</hi> was not thus circumſcribed the ſubject, ſays Lord Coke, <note place="margin">1 Inſt.</note> would feel it a <hi>crooked line, ruinous to the</hi> perſonal liberties of the people; <note place="margin">1 Black. 134.</note> whoſe liberties or rights have never been abridged, by the laws of England, <note place="margin">Mont. S.</note> without ſufficient cauſe, <note place="margin">L. b. 11. c. 5.</note> and can
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0151400300:20"/>
not ever be abridged, at the mere <hi>diſcretion</hi> of the magiſtrate, without explicit permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the laws.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Black. 6.</note> The reaſon of this doctrine is obvious. Civil liberty which is the very end and ſcope of the Engliſh conſtitution, rightly underſtood, conſiſts in the power of doing whatever the laws permit; which is only to be effected by a general conformity of all orders and degrees, to thoſe equitable rules of action, <note place="margin">Inſt. 1. 3. 1.</note> by which the <hi>meaneſt individual,</hi> is protected from the inſults and oppreſſion of the greateſt. If this was not the caſe there would be no liberty. For as Smith in his Commonwealth of England obſerves, ſpeaking of a court of equity, there is as much difference between the <hi>conſciences</hi> of men, or their <hi>diſcretion,</hi> as between the meaſure of their feet; and as one man may have a longer or ſhorter foot than another man, ſo may his <hi>conſcience</hi> or diſcretion be more contracted or extenſive.</p>
            <p>If the perſonal liberty of the ſubject was not thus protected by the law; if the higheſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0151400300:21"/>
magiſtrate, the KING himſelf, was not thus reſtricted in the exerciſe of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> weak, or corrupt judges, influenced by caprice, by reſentment, by party prejudice, or by obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ignorance might, under pretence of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal authority, exerciſe an <hi>arbitrary power.</hi> The fiat or warrant would attack the perſon of the deſtined victim—The demand of enormous bail would ſend him to priſon, where his ſufferings being unknown to the public, or if known, being ſoon forgotten, inevitable ruin, to himſelf and family, would be the conſequence. Impriſonment is the leaſt public, the leaſt ſtriking ſpecies of puniſhment. <hi>Arbitrary</hi> power of inflicting it, is the moſt dangerous engine that could be put into the hands of a man inclined to injure the rights of the people. Therefore, the common law has wiſely provided againſt it, by the writ of <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> which by a declaratory enacting and penal ſtatute, has been made one of the great bulwarks of the peoples' liberties.</p>
            <p>Happy is it for the ſubjects of the Britiſh and Iriſh crowns, that <hi>judicial diſcretion</hi> is thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0151400300:22"/>
within the bounds of reaſon, and controled by the rules of law. Men of the moſt conſummate knowledge and unbiaſſed probity, are ſtill men. Be their judgments ever ſo acute, their hearts ever ſo uncorrupt, yet even too exquiſite a ſenſibility of nature may in ſome caſes miſguide the one and pervert the other. Affection and prejudice operate ſtrongly in perſons of lively ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and urge them often to be unjuſt in thoſe very inſtances wherein they flatter themſelves they are only generous. Rare are thoſe talents which conſtitute a great judicial character. It requires a ready and clear ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; a found, diſtinguiſhing and exact act judgment; a comprehenſive underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; freedom and liberality of thought; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to inveſtigate the great principles of juſtice; and diſcernment to ſee where thoſe principles lead.—BACON was the wiſeſt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor ever ſat in a court of equity: JEF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERIES was a moſt excellent lawyer; but the one was corrupt, and the other was cruel. Had theſe men been ignorant, would their oppreſſions have been leſs?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0151400300:23"/>Having ſhown the nature and legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of diſcretionary power in judges the next point is,</p>
            <p>Were the <hi>arreſts,</hi> in the ſeveral ſuits againſt Magee for publiſhing libels, legal?</p>
            <p>The granting of a fiat, or judges warrant to hold a defendant to bail, is a truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the judges, to be exerciſed only on extraordinary caſes of neceſſity; and in what ever caſe they are granted, the greateſt delicacy, circumſpection and precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be attended to.</p>
            <p>A fiat ſhould never be granted in any caſe, but on poſitive affidavit, ſtating ſpecial circumſtances of actual loſs, of mayhem, of battery, or that the defendant is going to quit the kingdom.<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 186.</note> If a perſon has dangerouſly wounded another, the juſtice ought to be very cautious how he takes bail, till the year and day be paſt; becauſe the defendant is liable to an indictment for murder, if the wounded party die within a year and day; and the ſame reaſon ſhews
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0151400300:24"/>
the neceſſity of granting a warrant to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the delinquent; beſides in caſes of actions for mayhem, or violent battery, the wounds and the blows are poſſitive proofs of <hi>actual injury,</hi> and a breach of the peace. The aggreſſor is therefore held to bail not only to anſwer the damages, but to prevent his flight from juſtice.</p>
            <p>When a fiat is applied for on a poſitive affidavit that the defendant is going to leave the kingdom, and the proof of ſuch fact is accompanied with the further proof of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific damages, a fiat is neceſſary to render ſuch defendant ameanable to juſtice, and the conſequences of the ſuit. It is more expeditiouſly procured than the writ <hi>ne exeat regno,</hi> which may be granted, in any caſe, <note place="margin">2 Chanc. Caſ 245.</note> where there is danger of ſubterfuge from the juſtice of the nation though of private concernment.</p>
            <p>The law, or rather the diſcretionary power which ſhould rule, the conduct of the judge, in granting a <hi>ne exeat regno,</hi> applies ſtrictly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0151400300:25"/>
to the exerciſe of <hi>legal diſcretion</hi> in granting a <hi>fiat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LORD CHIEF JUSTICE HOLT ſays, a <hi>ne exeat regno</hi> ought not to be granted, <note place="margin">2 Chanc. Caſ. 245.</note> but upon great reaſon and examination, otherwiſe a <hi>homine replegiando</hi> may lie. <note place="margin">Farr. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the application for the writ <hi>ne exeat regno,</hi> which is a prerogative or ſtate writ, no <hi>general averment,</hi> though upon <hi>oath</hi> will be held ſufficient.</p>
            <p>The plaintiff applying for a <hi>ne exeat regno,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Skinn. 136.</note> is to make poſitive oath of his <hi>debt,</hi> and the writ is always marked for the ſum ſworn in the affidavit,<note place="margin">Chanc. C. 115.</note> in words at length and not in figures, and the plaintiff ſwears the defendant is <hi>going out of the kingdom,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">7 Mod. 9.</note> which if he ſhould do the <hi>debt</hi> may be loſt. The order is till anſwer, or further order, <note place="margin">Ld. Ray. 696.</note> and the party is obliged to give ſecurity before the court will diſcharge the writ, which ſecurity is taken by recognizance before a maſter, and is in the penalty of what is ſworn to be <hi>actually</hi> due and the ſheriff takes bail accordingly, <note place="margin">Caſ. in B. R. 562.</note>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0151400300:26"/>
when he arreſts the party thereon, <note place="margin">S tiles 441. —442.</note> the ſum ſwom to be due being conſtantly endorſed on the <hi>ne exeat regno</hi> as a guide for the ſheriff to take bail by.</p>
            <p>From a comparative view of the writ of <hi>ne exeat regno</hi> with a <hi>judges fiat,</hi> it appears then, that in granting the latter, the judge ſhould conſider and ſtrictly adhere to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal rules of <hi>diſcretion</hi> which are ſtrictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in granting the former.</p>
            <p>The <hi>reaſons</hi> for granting a fiat ſhould be equally ſtrong. The <hi>facts</hi> ſtated in the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit ſhould be equally ſpecific, and the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plaintiff, his <hi>credibility,</hi> and his cauſe of action, ſhould equally entitle him to this extraordinary interference and favour of the judge.</p>
            <p>Thus in Hilary 1787, in the common pleas of England, an application was made to Mr. Juſtice Gould to hold a defendant to bail, on a breach of promiſe of marriage. The affidavit ſtated the cauſe of action, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant (a lady) was going to quit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0151400300:27"/>
and that plaintiff bad ſuffered five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds damages. The judge held this affidavit inſufficient, becauſe plaintiff did not ſpecifically ſtate the cauſe or cauſes by which the damages accrued, but gave him leave to amend. He then ſwore, that at the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar requeſt of the defendant, he ſold his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for five hundred pounds, and ſpent the money on her, ſhe having poſitively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him marriage, and to purchaſe him a commiſſion of higher rank, and on this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit ſhe was held to bail.</p>
            <p>No man will be ſo weak or ſo raſh as to aſſert that the ſame caution and preciſſion is not neceſſary in granting a <hi>warrant</hi> at the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of a judge, that the law requires in iſſuing a <hi>prerogative writ.</hi> The latter is a royal <hi>truſt</hi> repoſed in the king, <note place="margin">F. N. B. 95.</note> which the law does not preſume that he will abuſe,<note place="margin">Lane 29.</note> or make uſe of to the prejudice of his ſubjects. <note place="margin">2 Co. 17. C. 76.</note> The former is a delegated truſt from the king to his repreſentative, <note place="margin">10 Co. 92.</note> the judge, who is ſworn to execute it according to law, and who is reſponſible to parliament for his conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0151400300:28"/>Having examined the nature and legal extent of <hi>diſcretionary power,</hi> the next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is,</p>
            <p>Whether a defendant can be held to bail for publiſhing a libel? againſt a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual.</p>
            <p>Magna Charta enacts, that no man ſhall be impriſoned but by judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. The impriſonment of Magee has not been by the judgment of his peers. Has it been by the law of the land? The anſwer is, there is neither law nor practice to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch a proceeding; for the diſcretion exerciſed, is not within the rules of " ſound reaſon, law, neceſſity, and convenience."</p>
            <p>The definition of a libel ſhows, that it is not an offence, for which a defendant ſhould be held to bail, even on a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0151400300:29"/>A libel is a <hi>miſdemeanor.</hi> and is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch, not for being a <hi>breach</hi> of the peace, but for its direct <hi>tendency</hi> to a breach of the peace by provoking to fight. Now, the law of England never intended, that the ſubject ſhould be held to bail for any miſdemeanor, that did not amount to an actual <hi>breach of the peace;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6 Mod. 178.</note> and formerly none could be taken up for a miſdemeanor till indictment found. <note place="margin">Regina v. Tracy. 1 Haw. 130.</note> Therefore, mere words of paſſion, as liar, knave, or raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, do not create a <hi>forfeiture of recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi> to keep the peace, for they do not challenge a man to <hi>break</hi> the peace, though they <hi>tend</hi> to it; from which the reaſonable concluſion is, that as <hi>ſlander</hi> does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur a forfeiture of recognizance for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace, neither is it an offence that can juſtify a judge, in holding a defendant to bail.</p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, that, though bail is not demandable in a criminal proſecution for a libel, againſt a private individual, yet the plaintiff may demand it in a civil ſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0151400300:30"/>Thoſe who thus argue, are called upon to ſhew a precedent, for holding a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to bail on any action for a libel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſes of <hi>ſcandalum magnatum,</hi> or ſlander of title. To make a plaintiff aſſeſſor of his owm damages, conceived perhaps in a moment of heat or reſentment would be, to eſtabliſh the groſſeſt miſchief. Damages can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcertained but by verdict of a jury on hearing evidence, and in many caſes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts have been ſet aſide for exceſs of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. Perjury and oppreſſion would be among the conſequences. It would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding by anticipation on the quantum of damages, which the jury ſhould give, and on the oath of the plaintiff himſelf. It would be contrary to natural juſtice, and the liberty of the ſubject, by enabling an inhuman plaintiff to impriſon a poor friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs defendant, upon an averment, for the ſpace of three terms, when upon trial it might appear that he was not guilty of the fact, or that what he publiſhed was not actionable. It would be uſeleſs as well as cruel, for thus puniſhing before conviction by fiat, when accompanied by exceſſive bail,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0151400300:31"/>
would be only a ſeverity known in thoſe countries, where private informers are encouraged to proſecute men obnoxious to the ſtate, and where torture precedes trial.</p>
            <p>The following cauſes lately tried at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, are ſo many proofs, that it is not the practice of the courts there, to grant warrants either in criminal or civil ſults brought upon libel.</p>
            <p>Theſe cauſes were—</p>
            <p>An information <hi>ex officio,</hi> by the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> againſt <hi>Lord George Gordon,</hi> for a libel againſt the <hi>Queen of France.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0151400300:32"/>
               <hi>Doctor Walcot,</hi> againſt <hi>Walter.</hi> An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>The Attorney General,</hi> againſt <hi>Stockdale.</hi> Information by order of the King on addreſs of the houſe of commons.</p>
            <p>The libels in all the above cauſes, (except the laſt), were of the moſt atrocious nature. Among the proſecutors and plaintiffs are ſeen
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0151400300:33"/>
the moſt illuſtrious characters. A queen, three princes, a lord chief juſtice and a doctor of laws. Walter and Withers were convicted and ſeverely puniſhed. Lord Loughborough and Mr. Pitt recovered da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. Perryman and Almon fled and were proceeded againſt by outlawry; yet, in none of theſe proſecutions and ſuits, which <hi>all</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated within the laſt two years, was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant held to bail, or a fiat even demanded.</p>
            <p>The above caſes are proofs ſufficient to ſhew that on proſecution and actions for libels, it is not the practice of the court of King's Bench of England to iſſue ſuch proceſs: and it follows that ſuch practice can not be legal here; for practice muſt be conſiſtent with law, and the common law of England, is by the aſſent and adoption of the people of Ireland, the common law of Ireland.</p>
            <p>Can it be ſhewn that EARL MANSFIELD, a prerogative judge, who extended the law of libels to its utmoſt ſtretch, ever granted a fiat in the caſe of a libel? Certainly not; his lordſhip well knew it was not within
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0151400300:34"/>
his <hi>judicial diſcretion;</hi> he well knew there was neither law nor practice to juſtify the iſſuing of ſuch a proceſs, in ſuch a caſe. To all thoſe therefore who argue in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the legal authority to hold defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to bail for publiſhing libels, may be applied Earl Cambden's requiſition to the noble lord above mentioned, who in arguing the writ of error brought on the judgment in the King's Bench on literary property ſaid—<hi>"Shew me a caſe."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing a few caſes ſhould be ſhewn in ſupport of practice, does it follow that the fiats recently iſſued againſt Magee are legal? Practice, like cuſtom, if contrary to law cannot be ſanctified by repetition or continuance. General warrants were in practice from the revolution down to the 6th of the preſent king, when after being ſolemnly argued in the court of Common Pleas and King's Bench, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared illegal.</p>
            <p>"The practice of a <hi>particular magiſtrate</hi> cannot controul the law. <hi>Communis error</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0151400300:35"/>
is not in this caſe ſufficient to make law. This is the <hi>duty</hi> and therefore doubtleſs the <hi>inclination</hi> of the court to ſtop the miſchief as ſoon as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of."—<note place="margin">Caſe of General Warrants</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the words of Dunning a great conſtitutional lawyer, <note place="margin">3 Burr. 1762.</note> and they made a proper impreſſion upon the court: for in the ſame caſe Lord Mansfield ſaid, "a <hi>uſage</hi> to grow into law ought to be a general uſage, <note place="margin">Money et al verſus Leach.</note> 
               <hi>communiter uſitata et ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probata;</hi> and which after a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance it would be miſchievous to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: <note place="margin">3 Burr. 1762.</note> and, Mr. Juſtice Aſton added, "<hi>No degree of antiquity</hi> can give ſanction to a uſage bad in itſelf."</p>
            <p>It may alſo be advanced, that if the judges had not authority to hold libellers to bail, juſtice would be evaded and delinquents eſcape with impunity. But is that the caſe? If the defendant flies, proceſs of outlawry iſſues againſt him, and the voluntary tranſportation of his perſon by flight is a ſeverer puniſhment in the eye of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0151400300:36"/>
law, than any the <hi>judicial diſcretion</hi> of the court can inflict; reſtricted as it now is, by the benign prohibition of the bill of rights, which declares that by the common law of the land, which protects the ancient rights and liberties of the people,<note place="margin">Stat. 1.

            <p>The next queſtion is:</p>

            <p>This definition is grounded on that given by Bracton. <note place="margin">Lib 3. Tract. 2. ca 8. mu. 8. 9.</note> Bail, ballium (from the French bailler, which comes from the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0151400300:46"/>
for his forth coming, in order to a <hi>ſafe keeping, or protection from priſon,</hi> and the end of bail in a civil action, is to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the condemnation and coſts, or to render the defendant to priſon.</p>
            <p>In all civil actions, whereon bail may be taken, <note place="margin">See the caſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited.</note> there ſhall be a poſitive affidavit of the cauſe of action, and no <hi>averment</hi> of damages is ſufficient, though on oath, to hold a defendant to bail. If a judge, will however take upon him to exceed his <hi>judicial diſcretion,</hi> and hold a defendant to bail, upon an averment of damages, whereby he allows the plaintiff to aſſeſs his own ſatisfaction, which is clearly the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right of a jury, he ſhould take care, that the eſtimate of the plaintiff be not ſo <hi>high</hi> as to <hi>impriſon</hi> the defendant, but ſo <hi>low</hi> as not to prohibit what the law allows him, <hi>"protection from priſon;"</hi> for this would be tant amount to <hi>withholding</hi> of bail.</p>
            <p>In criminal caſes, bail is not only the means of <hi>giving liberty</hi> to the priſoner, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0151400300:47"/>
at the ſame time, ſecures the extent of the law to puniſh an offender, and as it is the <hi>undertaking of a man's friends,</hi> for the purpoſe of his appearing to take his trial, or be dealt with according to law.; therefore, bail de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of the judge, ſhould always bear a relation to the defendant's ſituation in life, as well as to the offence charged upon him; for ſhould the bail be exceſſive, the defendant is precluded from that <hi>"undertaking of his friends,"</hi> which the law allows, "to protect him from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the judge does not act according to the rules of <hi>law and ſound reaſon,</hi> which are the guides to <hi>judicial diſcretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The law, by which bail is regulated in criminal and civil actions, appears clearly to be founded on the ſame principles, and to have the ſame great object in view, <hi>"the liberty of the ſubject."</hi> It never was intended that a man ſhould be impriſoned for <hi>damages,</hi> till thoſe damages were <hi>aſſeſſed by a jury,</hi> or for an <hi>offence</hi> till <hi>convicted by his country,</hi> unleſs that offence was of ſuch enormity and notoriety, that the four walls
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0151400300:48"/>
of a priſon only could be conſidered certain ſecurity, for his perſon.</p>
            <p>What is <hi>exceſſive</hi> bail, <note place="margin">1 New Ab. 226. Dalt. 14. 2. Hawk. p.c. 88. 89. Hal. p. c. 97.</note> may eaſily be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the eſtabliſhed law of the land. It is ſaid, not to be uſual for the King's-Bench to bail a man on a <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> on a commitment for treaſon or felony, without four ſureties, and the ſum in which the ſureties are to be bound, ought never be leſs than forty pounds for a <hi>capital crime;</hi> and in all felonies there ſhould be two ſureties; but it may be higher in <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> on conſideration of the ability and quality of the priſoner, and the nature of the offence.</p>
            <p>Now it appears from the above authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that if bail is to be taken at all for a libel, which conſidered as an offence, is not a <hi>breach of the peace,</hi> but only a miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, <hi>tending</hi> to a breach of it, that the <hi>leaſt</hi> bail, which the law allows in caſes of treaſon and felony, is the <hi>greateſt</hi> that the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of the court can legally demand
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0151400300:49"/>
for ſuch a ſpecies of miſdemeanor, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly where the libel is againſt a private individual, not againſt a peer, or againſt the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The bail demanded from Magee in the different actions for ſlander has been ſtated at the enormous ſums of four thouſand pounds, one thouſand pounds, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, and two thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee if ſuch demands be conſiſtent with the COMMON LAW.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee if it be prohited by the STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTE LAW.</p>
            <p>Theſe two points may be examined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The COMMON LAW lays it down, that juſtices muſt take care, <note place="margin">2 Hawk p. c. 89.</note> that under pretence of demanding <hi>ſufficient ſurety,</hi> they do not make ſo <hi>exceſſive a demand,</hi> as in effect to amount to a <hi>denial of bail.</hi> And in ſupport
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0151400300:50"/>
of this doctrine, a long ſtring of caſes might be produed, a few however will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as the great principles of bail are to be found in the <hi>petition of rights,</hi> and <hi>the habeas corpus act.</hi> But it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in thoſe caſes, even where the offences charged upon the defendant have been enormous, as actions for Mayhem, for violent and cruel batteries, <note place="margin">Barnes Notes 76. 191.</note> for malicious proſecutions, &amp;c. no bail has been demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that bears the leaſt proportion to the ſmalleſt ſum demanded from Magee.</p>
            <p>

caſe of Mr. Laurens; That learned gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">News pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per report of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> then declared, "that he did not think a <hi>man's ability to give large bail was a juſtification for demanding it."</hi>—</p>
            <p>In SIR THOMAS RUMBOLD'S caſe, <note place="margin">Parl. Reg. of Eng. 1782. by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brett.</note> a bill was brought into the houſe of commons, by Mr. Henry Dundaſs, then lord advocate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to reſtrain Sir Thomas from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of his property, by holding him to bail, in the ſum of one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> lawyers, were rouzed at this unconſtitutional requiſition of the <hi>Scotch</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate.—</p>
            <p>The ATTORNEY GENERAL ſaid, it was a hard caſe to impound a man's whole eſtate merely that he ſhould not fly from juſtice. <note place="margin">See defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of bail ante.</note> The demanding of enormous bail he reprobated in the moſt pointed terms, as amounting in reality to abſolute impriſonment; becauſe no man under ſuch a rule of bail, could <hi>indemnify others to become</hi> ſecurity for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0151400300:54"/>The SOLICITOR GENERAL argued on the ſame points. He inſiſted that the demand was contrary to the <hi>practice of the courts below;</hi> and that to exact exceſſive bail was a breach of the conſtitution. The law condemned ſuch bail as being cruel, by inflicting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on the innocent—by impriſoning before conviction, men who could procure reaſonable bail to enlarge them till the day of trial.</p>
            <p>MR. HASTINGS, impeached for high crimes and miſdemeanors, by the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the name of the people of Great Britain, was only held to ten thouſand pounds bail, though there could be no doubt of his capability to procure bail to any amount.</p>
            <p>From what has been advanced then it is clear,</p>
            <p>That the <hi>judicial diſcretion</hi> of judges, is circumſcribed and bound by the rules of law and ſound reaſon,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0151400300:55"/>That bail can not be demanded on acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for ſlander, except in caſes of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum magnatum or ſlander of title,</p>
            <p>That in all caſes where fiats are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able there muſt be a poſitive affidavit of the cauſe of action and of the ſpecific damages ſuffered by the defendant,</p>
            <p>That the bail demanded in the caſe of Magee was exceſſive, and,</p>
            <p>That in civil as well as in criminal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a demand of EXCESSIVE BAIL is ILLEGAL.</p>
            <p>N. B. The writer of this eſſay was not preſent, at the arguments in the court of King's-Bench, in any of the cauſes againſt Magee; nor was he in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when the queſtion of fiats and bail came before the repreſentatives of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of the proceedings in the King's-Bench he has ſeen no report. Of the arguments in the houſe of commons, he has ſeen only a newſpaper account, which however, tho'
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0151400300:56"/>
probably taken down with inaccuracy, and printed in haſte, diſplays great conſtitutional and legal abilities. To avail himſelf of other gentlemens genius and learning, the writer would have conſidered mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; he has therefore, with every poſſible caution, avoided the introduction of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular obſervation or expreſſion uſed in the report he has ſeen by the advocates of the people, though in principles it will be found he thinks with them, and the ſtudy of theſe principles of courſe led him to the caſes by which they are illuſtrated.</p>
