            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Hold it an indiſpenſible Duty to mention ſome Circumſtances, which gave Birth to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scenes, wherein I ſhall not only indulge my Pride, but, perhaps, in ſome Degree, palliate the Boldneſs, and (as it may be thought by many) Preſumption of my Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The Fable and Conduct of this Tragedy were projected as long ago as the Year 1761, by <hi>the late</hi> Mr. <hi>Shenſtone,</hi> at his ſweet Retirement, the <hi>Leaſowes,</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> Herein conſiſts my Pride, that I enjoyed a happy (but too ſhort) Intimacy with that amiable and accompliſhed Man.</p>
            <p>In the Summer of that ſame Year, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Shenſtone</hi>'s Letter, No. 105, to Mr. <hi>Graves, Sept.</hi> 14, 1761.</note> Mr. <hi>Shen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> had been preſent at the Performance of a haſty Alteration of Mr. <hi>Hawkins'</hi>s Tragedy of <hi>Henry and Roſamond,</hi> which I produced at the Theatre at <hi>Birmingham,</hi> for the temporary Uſe of a particular Friend. Undigeſted and imperfect as it was, that excellent Judge ſaid, there was a Pathos in the Story, which, notwithſtanding the Defects of the Drama,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0656402200:4"/>
made the Repreſentation very pleaſing; and he ſignified his Wonder that ſuch an affecting and <hi>popular Tale</hi> ſhould not have found its Way to the Stage. Hence aroſe many Converſations on the Subject, all which terminated in his adviſing me <hi>to make the Story my own.</hi> The known Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Heart, perhaps, gave me Credit for greater Abilities, than I really poſſeſſed. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to encourage me with a Warmth which flatters me in the Pecollection; and, after I had left <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> obliged me with ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the ſame Purpoſe, which I ſtill preſerve as <hi>valuable Relicts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one of thoſe Letters he ſuggeſted the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Abbot;</hi> in Order, as he ſaid, to add a little more Buſineſs to a Story, which otherwiſe might be too barren to furniſh Matter for five Acts. It may eaſily be ſuppoſed I forthwith adopted his Idea, and carefully treaſured in my Mind every Sentiment he let fall on this, as well as other Subjects; and I can ſay, with great Truth, that among the many Converſations I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with that excellent Man, I never knew one from which I did not derive conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as Delight.</p>
            <p>The unexpected Loſs of this moſt eſtimable Friend <note n="*" place="bottom">He died <hi>Feb.</hi> 11, 1763.</note> (which will ever be lamented by all who knew him) diſpirited me from the Undertaking,
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0656402200:5"/>
and I laid aſide my Plan, together with all his Letters, till the Beginning of laſt Year. The Scheme itſelf, it is true, had often, in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, occurred to my Remembrance, but a Doubt of my Ability to execute it, even in a <hi>paſſable</hi> Manner, deterred me from the Attempt.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Hartley</hi>'s Arrival at <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and the warm Solicitations of a Friend, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me once more to reſume the Deſign. The happy <hi>Suitability</hi> (if I may be allowed the Phraſe) of her Figure, to the Deſcription of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamond</hi> (as may be found in Dr. <hi>Percy</hi>'s amuſing and inſtructive Collection of old Ballads, Vol. ii. Page 137) viz.
<q>
                  <l>Her criſped Lockes, like Threads of Golde,</l>
                  <l>Appear'd to each Man's Sight;</l>
                  <l>Her ſparkling Eyes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
aſſiſted by the Softneſs and Gentleneſs of her Demeanour, encouraged me, at length, to make the Attempt; and the unniverfal Aprobation given by the Public to her Appearance, Manner and Performance, on the firſt Repreſentation of this Play, happily convinced me I was not ſingular in my Opinion.</p>
            <p>In the general Execution of the Piece I have paid a particular Attention to the <hi>old Ballad,</hi> and endeavoured at a Simplicity of Style, both which Mr. <hi>Shenſtone</hi> earneſtly recommended. I am not conſcious of any further Helps, except having
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0656402200:6"/>
adopted the Idea (not the Matter) of an Interview between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Clifford</hi> in the Monaſtery, from Mr. <hi>Hawkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had originally made <hi>Clifford</hi> die of a broken Heart, under the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ction of the Death of <hi>King Lear,</hi> as originally drawn by that great Maſter of human Nature. <hi>Shakeſpeare;</hi> but the general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Public, and the Perſuaſions of my Friends, induced me to vary my Deſign in the Repreſentation.</p>
            <p>I have little further to add, but my Intreaties that the Reader will be pleaſed to judge with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, what was undertaken with Diffidence.</p>
            <p>Adviſed, aſſiſted, and encouraged as I was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, to this Undertaking, by the Poſſeſſor of ſuch eminent Abilities, and ſuch Benignity of Diſpoſition, I ſeek no <hi>living</hi> Patron, but pride myſelf in having this Opportunity to dedicate my humble Production,</p>

               <hi>This Day is publiſhed, BELL</hi>'s EDITION OF Shakeſpeare's Acting Plays.</p>
            <p>With twenty-four engravings, done from original drawings made on purpoſe for this work, by Mr. Edwards of the Royal Academy, and executed at a very great expence, by a ſelect number of the moſt eminent Engliſh engravers; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with two ſpeaking portraits of SHAKESPEARE and GARRICK, Both which are executed by Mr. Hall, and deſervedly looked upon as the beſt productions of this country.</p>
            <p>This curious edition is beautifully printed on fine demy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in five volumes, price only Fifteen Shillings ſewed; and alſo on ſuperfine royal paper, large enough to admit of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal notes, at One Guinea per ſet, ſewed.</p>
            <p>It contains twenty-four of the author's moſt eſteemed plays, each of which is ornamented with a beautiful frontiſpiece, and regulated, by permiſſion of the Managers, agreeable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mode of performance at the Theatres Royal in London, by Mr. Hopkins, prompter, at Drury-lane, and Mr. Younger, prompter, at Covent-garden; with notes critical and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, reſpecting the text, and the requiſites neceſſary to do each material character juſtice on the ſtage, By the AUTHORS of the DRAMATIC CENSOR.</p>
            <p>The Introduction contains an eſſay on Oratory, which may ſerve as improving leſſons to profeſſors of the pulpit and the bar, as well as of the ſtage.—The leſs eſteemed plays of Shakeſpeare will be publiſhed early this ſeaſon, in order to complete this immortal author's works, in the ſame elegant and convenient manner; thoſe, therefore, who wiſh to poſſeſs the firſt impreſſions of the future, as well as the preſent plates, are deſired to forward their addreſs as ſoon as poſſible to the publiſhers.</p>

                        <head>CRITIQUE on Part of the PLATES in BELL's Edition of SHAKESPEARE.</head>
                        <p>Excellent engraving is a beauty of itſelf, and will always to the generality of people appear an ornament, independent of the deſign, or other qualities, of a good print. The French ſeem to have underſtood this better than any other nation.</p>
                        <p>In imitation of the magnificent editions of the Louvre, they have bedecked their ordinary books with cuts, ſignets, meda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, head and tail pieces; in the execution of which lies all their merit. Neatneſs and propriety ſtrike at once a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial eye, and therefore aiding their language with <hi>the bagatelles</hi> I have mentioned, the Parifians are thought to have ſold more books than any three cities in Europe.</p>
                        <p>An edition of Shakeſpeare's acting plays being lately adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, I had the curioſity to glance at the propoſals, but coming to that part of the advertiſement, where five volumes, with <hi>elegant plates,</hi> are offered for fifteen ſhillings, I pitied Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, and thought no more of the work. They are now pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and afford a happy inſtance of what the public are to expect from a bookſeller, who has ſpirit to ſhare his profits with artiſts of merit. I had often thought of writing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:0656402200:90"/>
upon the preſent ſubject, and cannot, without injuſtice, paſs this new edition in ſilence.</p>
                        <p>With exception of one or two at moſt, theſe plates are highly finiſhed, finiſhed with freedom and force, united to the admired neatneſs of the French <hi>Burin.</hi> I am ſorry the deſigns are not, upon the whole, equal to the execution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though many of them merit the higheſt applauſe; and ſince I have criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the plates of former editions, I ſhall make equally free with the preſent, and praiſe or blame, where, in my opinion, either is deſerved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Othello</hi> gives no idea of the noble Moor. The expreſſion of jealouſy is too ambiguous and ſtrong to be marked with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in miniature; he looks not like an injured ſoldier, but an old enraged eunuch of the ſeraglio. <hi>Iago</hi> is an excellent figure, his action ſteady, the attitude ſpeaks deſign, and the eye watches the effect of his villany upon the unhappy huſband.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Brutus</hi> and the <hi>Evil Genius</hi> would not make the ghoſt of a Roman between them; it is a bad print, and no part of it better than another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Roſalind</hi> and her companion, in the comedy of <hi>As you like it,</hi> is one of the ſweeteſt cuts I remember to have ſeen; the action is well choſen, the expreſſion juſt, and the execution delicate as the ſubject. The ſoftneſs of the ſex ſhines through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculine dreſs, and finely conveys the idea of the poet. Had the trees in the back ground been executed with a little more care, and the keeping better preſerved, this print would have been a maſter-piece.</p>
                        <p>Every perſon muſt be pleaſed with <hi>Piſtol</hi> in <hi>Harry the fifth:</hi> the deſign is good, the action natural—the expreſſion ſtrong, and the execution ſuperior to any poetical cut I ever ſaw in an Engliſh publication.</p>

                           <hi>Iachimo</hi> and <hi>Imogen</hi> deſerve great approbation; the ſeene is dumb ſhow, therefore capable of being perfectly repreſented: accordingly, the <hi>ſang-froid</hi> of the Italian, taking an inventory of the lady's beauty, is nicely hit—ſhe ſleeps well; her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is natural, and the execution fleſhy and delicate.</p>
                        <p>The delivery of the letter in <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> muſt alſo give univerſal ſatisfaction; there is a great deal of character in the king and <hi>Wolſey,</hi> and what is further commendable, they are portraits of theſe perſonages. <hi>Wolſey</hi> receives the letter with a courtly ſmile, in place of that ſtupefaction viſible in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Gravelot, before its contents were known.</p>

                           <hi>Falſtaff</hi> aſſuming the conqueſt of <hi>Percy,</hi> is a pleaſant high-finiſhed cut; <hi>Sir John</hi> recalls rather too much the idea of Mr. Shuter in that part, but the youth and gallant figure of the prince is happily ſtruck, and the fallen <hi>Percy</hi> judiciouſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhortened. I think he ſhould have retained ſomething of the terrible in death.</p>

                           <hi>Doctor Caius, Mrs. Quickly,</hi> and <hi>Simple,</hi> in the <hi>Merry Wives of Windſor,</hi> are truly comic, well conceived, and convey the very ſpirit of the ſcene; the execution is equal to the deſign, and make together a very perfect print.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Grignion</hi> has been very happy in the frontiſpiece for <hi>Much ado about Nothing—</hi>His etching gives a peculiar ſpirit to a print, where he is pleaſed to beſtow pains and the arch ſmile in the face of the prince and <hi>Leonato,</hi> in pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, demands the attention of an actor.</p>

                        <p>I could with pleaſure review the others, but have already exceeded the ſhort ſketch intended. The ſubject of prints is fertile and entertaining. I could wiſh to ſee it treated by thoſe who have more leiſure and abilities than I am maſter of. Their merits might thence become more generally underſtood, and the art rendered of ſolid uſe and ornament to the works of the learned.</p>

Illuſtrated by elegant engravings, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the different attitudes on which the principles and grace of the art depend; painted from life, and executed in a moſt elegant and maſterly manner. By Mr. OLIVIER, educated at the Royal Academy at Paris, and profeſſor of fencing, in London. Price 7s. bound.</p>
                  <q>The author of this work humbly preſumes, that he has offered many conſiderable improvements in the art of fencing; having founded his principles on nature, and confuted many falſe notions, hitherto adopted by the moſt eminent maſters; he has rendered the play ſimple, and made it eaſy and plain, even to thoſe who were before unacquainted with this Art. After bringing his ſcholar as far as the aſſault, and having demonſtrated to him all the thruſts and various parades, he lays down rules for defence in all ſorts of ſword-play." The Monthly reviewers, expreſs themſelves in the following terms: "For ought we dare ſay to the contrary, Mr. Olivier's book is a very good book, and may help to teach, as much as books can teach, the noble ſcience of defence; or, as our author terms it, ſword-play; and it is made more particularly uſeful, by the various attitudes and poſitions, which ſeem to be here accurately and elegantly delineated.</q>

                  <p>The GENTLEMAN's POCKET FARRIER, ſhewing how to uſe your horſe on a journey; and what remedies are proper for common accidents that may befal him on the road.</p>
                  <p>This little tract has been in great eſtimation, for theſe fifty years paſt, and has gone through many edition in Ireland. The remedies it preſcribes, are ſimple, and eaſily obtained, and never fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
                  <p>It may not be unneceſſary to acquaint the reader, that theſe preſcriptions have not been haſtily jumbled together, but are experimentally efficacious. A great many books have been written on farrlery, of which Gibſon's is undoubtedly the beſt, but his rules are too tedious for the pocket. Such a book therefore as this, is neceſſary on a journey, in order to refer to as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires; and it contains as much as is known by any of our common farriers.</p>
                  <p>As ſmall as this tract may appear, it will be found to inform gentlemen, firſt, what methods are beſt to be uſed, if their horſes fall lame. Secondly, what medicines are proper to give him when ſick. Thirdly, how to direct the operations, and eſcape the impoſitions, of ignorant men. In ſhort, by the help of this treatiſe, gentlemen will be able to prevent a groom or farrier from injuring their horſes, by improper applications, and miſtaking one diſtemper for another.</p>
                  <p>The receipts are few, naked, and cheap; the poultice but one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived on purpoſe to prevent trouble, and ſave time and cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The book is drawn up in a manner calculated for a gentleman's pocket, ſuppoſing him upon a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and no man, who values his horſe, ſhould travel without it.</p>
