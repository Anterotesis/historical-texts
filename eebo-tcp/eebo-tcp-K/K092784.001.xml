            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>You wou'd not only conquer, but undo:</l>
                  <l>You, cruel victor, weary of your flame,</l>
                  <l>Would ſeek a cure in my eternal ſhame;</l>

            <head>EPISTLE from ARTHUR GREY, the Footman, after his Condemnation for attempting a Rape.</head>

            <lg>
               <l>READ, lovely nymph, and tremble not to read,</l>
               <l>I have no more to wiſh, nor you to dread:</l>
               <l>I aſk not life, for life to me were vain,</l>
               <l>And death a refuge from ſeverer pain.</l>
               <l>My only hope in theſe laſt lines I try;</l>
               <l>I would be pitied, and I then would die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long had I liv'd as ſordid as my fate,</l>
               <l>Nor curs'd the deſtiny that made me wait</l>
               <l>A ſervile ſlave: content with homely food,</l>
               <l>The groſs inſtinct of appetite purſued:</l>
               <l>Youth gave me ſleep at night and warmth of blood.</l>
               <l>Ambition yet had never touch'd my breaſt;</l>
               <l>My lordly maſter knew no ſounder reſt;</l>
               <l>With labour healthy, in obedience bleſt.</l>
               <l>But when I ſaw—oh! had I never ſeen</l>
               <l>That wounding ſoftneſs, that engaging mein!</l>
               <l>The miſt of wretched education flies,</l>
               <l>Shame, fear, deſire, deſpair and love ariſe,</l>
               <l>The new creation of thoſe beauteous eyes.</l>

But yet that love purſued no guilty aim,</l>
               <l>Deep in my heart I hid the ſecret flame.</l>
               <l>I never hop'd my fond deſire to tell,</l>
               <l>And all my wiſhes were to ſerve you well.</l>
               <l>Heav'ns! how I flew, when wing'd by your command,</l>
               <l>And kiſs'd the letters giv'n me by your hand.</l>
               <l>How pleas'd, how proud, how fond was I to wait,</l>
               <l>Preſent the ſparkling wine, or change the plate!</l>
               <l>How when you ſung, my ſoul devour'd the ſound,</l>
               <l>And every ſenſe was in the rapture drown'd!</l>
               <l>Tho' bid to go, I quite forgot to move;</l>
               <l>—You knew not that ſtupidity was love!</l>
               <l>But oh! the torment not to be expreſs'd,</l>
               <l>The grief, the rage, the hell that fir'd this breaſt,</l>
               <l>When my great rivals, in embroid'ry gay,</l>
               <l>Sate by your ſide, or led you from the play.</l>
               <l>I ſtill contriv'd near as I could to ſtand,</l>
               <l>(The flambeau trembling in my ſhaking hand)</l>
               <l>I ſaw, or thought I ſaw thoſe fingers preſs'd,</l>
               <l>For thus their paſſion by my own I gueſs'd,</l>
               <l>And jealous fury all my ſoul poſſeſs'd.</l>
               <l>Like torrents, love and indignation meet,</l>
               <l>And madneſs wou'd have thrown me at your feet.</l>

               <l>This is true paſſion in my eyes you ſee;</l>
               <l>They cannot, no—they cannot love like me.</l>
               <l>Frequent debauch has pall'd their ſickly taſte,</l>
               <l>Faint their deſire, and in a moment paſt:</l>

They ſigh not from the heart, but from the brain;</l>
               <l>Vapours of vanity, and ſtrong champagne.</l>
               <l>Too dull to feel what forms, like yours, inſpire,</l>
               <l>After long talking of their painted fire,</l>
               <l>To ſome lewd brothel they at night retire;</l>
               <l>There pleas'd with fancy'd quality and charms,</l>
               <l>Enjoy your beauties in a ſtrumpet's arms.</l>
               <l>Such are the joys thoſe toaſters have in view,</l>

               <l>They ſwear to thouſands what they ſwear to one.</l>
               <l>Not thus I ſigh—but all my ſighs are vain—</l>
               <l>Die, wretched ARTHUR, and conceal thy pain:</l>
               <l>'Tis impudence to wiſh, and madneſs to complain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Fix'd on this view, my only hope of eaſe,</l>
               <l>I waited not the aid of ſlow diſeaſe:</l>
               <l>The keeneſt inſtruments of death I ſought,</l>
               <l>And death alone employ'd my lab'ring thought.</l>
               <l>This all the night—when I remember well,</l>
               <l>The charming tinkle of your morning bell!</l>
               <l>Fir'd by the ſound, I haſten'd with your tea,</l>
               <l>With one laſt look to ſmooth the darkſome way—</l>
               <l>But oh! how dear that fatal look has coſt!</l>
               <l>In that fond moment my reſolves were loſt.</l>
               <l>Hence all my guilt, and all your ſorrows riſe—</l>
               <l>I ſaw the languid ſoftneſs of your eyes;</l>

I ſaw the dear diſorder of your bed;</l>
               <l>Your cheek all glowing with a tempting red;</l>
               <l>Your night-cloaths tumbled with reſiſtleſs grace;</l>
               <l>Your flowing hair play'd careleſs round your face;</l>
               <l>Your night-gown faſten'd with a ſingle pin;</l>
               <l>—Fancy improv'd the wond'rous charms within!</l>
               <l>I fix'd my eyes upon that heaving breaſt,</l>
               <l>And hardly, hardly I forbore the reſt;</l>
               <l>Eager to gaze, unſatisfy'd with ſight,</l>
               <l>My head grew giddy with the near delight!</l>
               <l>—Too well you know the fatal following night!</l>
               <l>Th' extremeſt proof of my deſire I give,</l>
               <l>And ſince you will not love, I will not live.</l>
               <l>Condemn'd by you, I wait the righteous doom,</l>
               <l>Careleſs and fearleſs of the woes to come.</l>
               <l>But when you ſee me waver in the wind,</l>

               <l>Think that my life was quite below my care,</l>
               <l>Nor fear'd I any hell beyond deſpair—</l>

               <l>WHEN I firſt came to London, I rambled about</l>

               <l>Then on me, in divinity batchelor, try'd</l>

               <l>Who, ſpider like, ſeizes weak proteſtant flies,</l>

               <l>Ah pity your ſoul, for without our church pale,</l>
               <l>If you happen to die, to be damn'd you can't fail;</l>
               <l>The bible, you boaſt, is a wild revelation,</l>

               <l>WHEN learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes</l>
               <l>Firſt rear'd the ſtage, immortal SHAKESPEAR roſe;</l>
               <l>Each change of many-colour'd life he drew,</l>
               <l>Exhauſted worlds, and then imagin'd new:</l>
               <l>Exiſtence ſaw him ſpurn her bounded reign,</l>
               <l>And panting time toil'd after him in vain:</l>
               <l>His pow'rful ſtrokes preſiding truth impreſs'd,</l>
               <l>And unreſiſted paſſion ſtorm'd the breaſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then JOHNSON came, inſtructed from the ſchool,</l>
               <l>To pleaſe in method, and invent by rule;</l>
               <l>His ſtudious patience, and laborious art,</l>
               <l>By regular approach eſſay'd the heart;</l>
               <l>Cold approbation gave the ling'ring bays,</l>
               <l>For thoſe who durſt not cenſure, ſcarce cou'd praiſe.</l>
               <l>A mortal born, he met the general doom,</l>
               <l>But left, like Egypt's kings, a laſting tomb.</l>

               <l>The wits of Charles found eaſier ways to fame,</l>
               <l>Nor wiſh'd for JOHNSON's art, or SHAKESPEAR's flame;</l>
               <l>Themſelves they ſtudied, as they felt, they writ,</l>
               <l>Intrigue was plot, obſcenity was wit.</l>
               <l>Vice always found a ſympathetick friend;</l>
               <l>They pleas'd their age, and did not aim to mend.</l>
               <l>Yet bards like theſe aſpir'd to laſting praiſe,</l>
               <l>And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days.</l>
               <l>Their cauſe was gen'ral, their ſupports were ſtrong,</l>
               <l>Their ſlaves were willing, and their reign was long;</l>
               <l>Till ſhame regain'd the poſt that ſenſe betray'd,</l>
               <l>And virtue call'd oblivion to her aid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then cruſh'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd,</l>
               <l>For years the pow'r of tragedy declin'd;</l>
               <l>From bard to bard, the frigid caution crept,</l>
               <l>Till declamation roar'd, while paſſion ſlept.</l>
               <l>Yet ſtill did virtue deign the ſtage to tread,</l>
               <l>Philoſophy remain'd, though nature fled.</l>
               <l>But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit,</l>
               <l>She ſaw great Fauſtus lay the ghoſt of wit:</l>
               <l>Exulting folly hail'd the joyful day,</l>
               <l>And pantomime and ſong, confirm'd her ſway.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But who the coming changes can preſage,</l>
               <l>And mark the future periods of the ſtage?—</l>
               <l>Perhaps if ſkill could diſtant times explore,</l>
               <l>New Behns, new Durfeys, yet remain in ſtore.</l>
               <l>Perhaps, where Lear has rav'd, and Hamlet dy'd,</l>
               <l>On flying cars new ſorcerers may ride.</l>

Perhaps, (for who can gueſs th' effects of chance?)</l>
               <l>Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Hard is his lot, that here by fortune plac'd,</l>

               <l>With ev'ry meteor of caprice muſt play,</l>
               <l>And chaſe the new-blown bubbles of the day.</l>
               <l>Ah! let not cenſure term our fate our choice,</l>
               <l>The ſtage but echoes back the publick voice.</l>
               <l>The drama's laws the drama's patrons give,</l>
               <l>For we that live to pleaſe, muſt pleaſe to live.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then prompt no more the follies you decry,</l>
               <l>As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die;</l>
               <l>'Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence</l>
               <l>Of reſcu'd nature, and reviving ſenſe;</l>
