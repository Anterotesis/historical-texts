            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Muſt here acquaint the Reader, that through the whole I have not once made uſe of the common, tho' barbarous, word <hi>Man-midwife,</hi> except in quotations, becauſe it carries Nonſenſe in the very front of it: How can a Man be a Wife, except he be a <hi>Hermaphrodite?</hi> May they not as properly ſay a Man-Monkey, a Man-Gooſe, or a Man-Aſs. The French expreſs it very beautifully by the word Accoucheur, i. e. a Man who delivers women in labour. And I ſhall always expreſs it by the Word Midman; which, tho' not ſo neat as the French, yet is much better than the abſurd Word complained of.</p>
            <p>THE common Word Midwife is alſo often very improperly uſed, E. G. A. Maid may be taught the art of delivering women, yet ſhe is not a Wife. Widows alſo lay women, yet they are not Wives. Therefore to reconcile this impropriety, I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, except in quotations, call them Midwomen, which includes Maids, Wives, and Widows. But Dr. Maubray, (the worſt writer on this ſubject) and Mr. Chapman after him, make uſe of another appellation, much more abſurd, viz. Woman-Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, Women-Midvives: Pray would not ſaying Midwife and Midwives, diſtinguiſh their ſex ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently? Pray who ever heard of Girl-Midwives?</p>

            <head>THE STATE of MIDWIFERY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S it not very ſurpriſing, nay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, that tho' almoſt all the other parts of Surgery have been cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with great aſſiduity, by the moſt knowing Men, ever ſince Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, nay and before him, yet ('till about the middle of the laſt century) the operations neceſſary for the ſafety of women in labour, and their children; operations of more conſequence to mankind than almoſt all the reſt; operations ſo often wanted, ſo difficult many times to perform, and upon which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways two, and ſometimes more lives depend, ſeem to have been entirely left to a parcel of ignorant women, or to Men little better qualified than they, who upon any extraordinary difficulty (as too many ſtill do) took hooks or knives, and carved the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to pieces; and often alſo deſtroyed the Mother?</p>
            <p>The Surgeons at Paris, &amp;c. to remedy this evil, have for many years paſt, obliged all the Midwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be examined and approved of at their hall, before ever they dare ſet up for practice: An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample moſt worthy of imitation! But how, or by what infatuation, our <hi>Dom. fac. totum</hi> ſuffered theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0202500700:7"/>operations to drop through their fingers, (as if they were no part of their profeſſion, as if they were not manual operations, or were of little or no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to mankind,) into the hands of Doctors, <hi>inferioris ſortis medici,</hi> (as a certain Gentleman calls them,) Apothecaries, and the loweſt claſs of their own Fraternity! (ſome of whom have been, and are, as illiterate, of as low capacities, and as little acquainted with the other great operations of Surgery, as almoſt any of the women) and have and do allow every ſilly woman, who takes it in her head, with very little or no inſtruction, to practice <hi>impunè</hi> among his Majeſty's ſubjects, without any the leaſt examination or licence! are queſtions I ſhall not now take upon me to anſwer. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>THE firſt rational account we ever had of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering women in labour, was publiſhed at Paris by Mr. Mauriceau, in 1668. In his dedication, he gives the following honeſt account of his deſign: <q>I have the rather undertaken this work, that Midwives might find therein what they ought to know, the better to exerciſe their art, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the examination they are obliged to at Surgeons-Hall, before they are admitted to practice.</q> In his preface, he ſays, <q>I have not run out into ſuperfluous diſcourſe</q> (i. e. he had avoided all puzzling and unintelligible Theories and Hypotheſes, about generation, nutrition, ſuperfoetation, and ſuch ſort of jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,) <q>that I might be more ſerviceable both to Surgeons and Midwives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS plain practical work, would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have had a much better effect upon our Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0202500700:8"/>had they not been puzzled and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (inſtead of being inſtructed) by the artful inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of the tranſlator, in his preface and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal notes, publiſhed in 1672. as will appear by the following quotations.</p>
            <p>DR. Chamberlen, in his preface, ſays, <q>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long obſerved the great want of neceſſary directions how to govern women with child, and in child-bed, &amp;c. I deſign'd a ſmall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual to that purpoſe; but meeting ſome time after in France with this treatiſe of Mauriceau, which in my opinion exceeds all former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I changed my reſolution into that of tranſlating him; whom I need not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, becauſe he is fortified with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wardens of the Surgeons company of Paris.</q> Pray would the Doctor have thought he had been ſo well fortified, if he had had the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the then wardens of the Surgeons company of London? or the approbation of the college of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians at Paris? <q>I have carefully rendered his book into Engliſh, for the benefit of our Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives.</q> This is certainly a very fair and honeſt Exordium, a worthy and laudablc Deſign; but pray mark the end on't: <q>Of whom many may yet very well admit of an additional knowledge.</q> This cannot be denied, but pray where are they to go look for this additional knowledge, if he means, in their profeſſion? Is it to be found in his preface and marginal notes upon Mauriceau's work? No! they rather darken, than explain, the Author's meaning. But the additional knowledge the Doctor means, and has taken ſuch pains to inculcate, through the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0202500700:9"/>whole of his preface and notes, is to inform them the He and his family can aſſiſt them better than any other Men; that they have no buſineſs to meddle with any child, except thoſe who juſt drop into their hands, and that whenever the leaſt difficulty appears, to ſend for him, or ſome or the Noſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers; as will appear evidently from the tenure of the whole.</p>
            <p>THEN he goes on, <q>The principal thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the obſervation of Midwives in this book, is accurately to diſcover what is properly their work, and when it is neceſſary to ſend for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and aſſiſtance, that ſo, <hi>many women and children may be preſerved, that now periſh for want of ſeaſonable help.</hi>
               </q> i. e. ſhall victims to the ignorance of Midwomen. <q>And that Midwife's ſkill is certainly the greateſt, and ſhe deſerves moſt commendation, who can ſooneſt diſcover the ſucceſs of the labour, and accordingly either wait with patience, or timely ſend for advice and help.</q> Pray is not that Midwwoman's ſkill ſtill greater? and does ſhe not deſerve much more commendation? who can ſooneſt diſcover what obſtructs the delivery, and then removes the obſtruction herſelf, and thereby ſaves the woman the fright, trouble, and expence, of ſending for any farther help or advice? <q>Nor can it be ſo great a diſcredit to a Midwife (let ſome of them imagine what they pleaſe) to have a woman or child ſaved by a man's aſſiſtance, as to ſuffer either to die under her own hand, tho' delivered: For that Midwife miſtakes her office, that thinks ſhe hath performed it, by only laying
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0202500700:10"/>the woman; becauſe her principal duty is to take care that ſhe and her child be well, with ſafety and convenient ſpeed parted;</q> who don't know that? <q>and, if this be impoſſible for her, it will juſtify her better to wave her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reputation, and ſend for help.</q> No doubt of it. But would it not have been much better if they had been taught to do their office themſelves?</p>
            <p>THUS you ſee Mr. Mauriceau's deſign in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing his book, was to inſtruct the Midwomen how to perform their office better; but Dr. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen perverts that deſign, and ſeems to have the Intereſt of the Midmen, and not that of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, or — principally at heart, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the foregoing quotations, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe coaxes and threats, which he plays off ſo briſkly upon the town Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, (who are undoubtedly much better qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than thoſe in the country) in caſe they don't ſend for him, &amp;c. on every trifling difficulty, he goes on, and ſays, <q>Yet in countries and places where help and good advice is not ſeaſonably to be had, Midwives are compelled to do their beſt, as God ſhall enable them.</q> Pray has God any where promiſed to give more aſſiſtance to a country than a town Midwoman? Thus the poor country Midwomen are to act as God ſhall enable them; but the town Midwomen, as the Doctor &amp;c. ſhall direct, <hi>Utrum horum!</hi> Pray has God Almighty given us the leaſt ground to expect, that he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us in an inſtant, even upon the moſt urgent occaſion, with the perfect knowledge of any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful art, only becauſe it would juſt then be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202500700:11"/>to us? No. But he has told us, that, if we want to acquire the knowledge of any uſeful art, we muſt diligently and aſſiduouſly apply ourſelves to the ſtudy of it in the moſt proper manner we can. <hi>Dii laborantibus omnia vendunt!</hi>
               <q>Which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and uncertain trials in doth not become them to put in practice upon women, where no timely aſſiſtance need be wanting.</q> Thus you ſee, the Doctor thinks dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain trials may lawfully be put in practice on women in the country, tho' not upon thoſe in town, where he and the reſt of the Noſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers may be had. But, pray, might not many of theſe uncertain and dangerous trials, both in town and country, have been prevented, if he had endeavoured as much to inſtruct them how to give better aſſiſtance themſelves, as he has done to let them know when to ſend for him, &amp;c. Are not the women's lives in the country as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable as thoſe in town?</p>
            <p>THEN he goes on to tell them in what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes they ought to ſend for him, &amp;c. viz. "1. In moſt wrong births, with or without pain."

And ſome other;</q> (i. e. every other caſe, when the People are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,) viz. <q>tho' the child be right, if little or no pain, after the breaking of the waters, and the child's not following them in ſome ſix or ten hours after, require the good advice of, and, peradventure, ſpeedy delivery by expert phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0202500700:12"/>clans in this practice.</q> Pray would not expert Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in this practice do as well? Is it not evident from the Doctor's liſt of caſes, that very few wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (except thoſe in the country, or who are very poor) could eſcape thoſe expert Phyſicians? viz. He, his father, and two brothers.</p>
            <p>BUT leaſt the charge he has given to the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women (of ſending for him, &amp;c. upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling occaſion) ſhould not have weight enough, he alſo threatens the poor ſuffering women with what may happen to them, in caſe they don't oblige their Midwomen to ſend for them. <q>Let me therefore adviſe the good women, not ſo readily to blame thoſe Midwives who are not backward in dangerous caſes," <hi>(or not dangerous caſes,)</hi> to deſire advice, leaſt it coſt them dear;" (pray don't it always coſt them dear when they do?) by diſcouraging and forcing them to preſume beyond their knowledge and ſtrength,</q> As for their want of knowledge, I take it to be more their misfortune than their fault, becauſe they have not yet had ſuch proper opportunities of informing themſelves, as they ought to have; but as to ſtrength, I'm ſatisfied moſt of them have enough, did they know how to make a proper uſe of it. eſpecially when too many are over confident." For this compliment the Midwomen are as much obliged to him, as for many others he paſſes upon them.</p>
            <p>In another place he ſays, <q>If therefore the uſe of hooks by Phyſicians</q> (pray what buſineſs have phyſicians with hooks? Are not pen, ink, and paper, their proper inſtruments? What right
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202500700:13"/>have they then to encroach upon us? Don't they make a ſad outcry, are not they alarmed as if their craft was in danger, when we uſe pen and ink? except in Pauper caſes. <q>and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, be condemned, (without thereto neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated by ſome monſtrous birth, &amp;c.)</q> Now you ſee he is obliged to own, notwithſtanding all he ſays to the contrary, that hooks are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abſolutely neceſſary. <q>We can much leſs approve of a Midwife's uſing them, as ſome here in England boaſt they do; which raſh preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in France, would call them in queſtion for their lives.</q> The Doctor allows, pag. 5. country Midwives are compelled to do their beſt as God ſhall direct; them: Now ſuppoſing that God ſhould direct one of them to make uſe of a croch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, in a fit caſe, and after a proper manner, muſt ſhe be tried for her life for it? Is not this a very hard charge upon the poor Midwomen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proof? I muſt diffent ſo far from the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's opinion, that I believe the hardieſt Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman in London, would tremble at the very thought of it, unleſs they were fully inſtructed how to uſe it, as—; but for what they may do in the country, according to the Doctor's advice, above recited, I cannot anſwer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mauriceau (pag. 179.) ſays, <q>A Midwife vaunted ſhe was more ſkilful in her art than any Surgeon.</q> Upon which Dr. Chamberlen remarks, that, <q>It ſeems Midwives in other countries, as well as England, have that pernicious vanity.</q> But, pray were there no Midmen then in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who had vaunted they could perform what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202500700:14"/>they really could not? Vid. Mr. Mauriceau's 26th obſervation, quoted below.</p>
            <p>MR. Mauriceau, pag. 203. <q>If the arm be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as the ſhoulder, &amp;c. Dr. Chamberlen remarks, which ſeldom is, unleſs an Ignorant Midwife tamper with it.</q> Are not theſe pretty compliments? but where is the inſtruction? Are not all practitioners, of the very leaſt experience, ſenſible it often happens without any tampering. But notwithſtanding he has been ſo laviſh in theſe, and many other places, in cenſuring thoſe good women, yet he winds up his preface with a ſalvo for all, viz. <q>I hope no good Midwives will blame me for reprehending the faults of Bad ones, who are only aimed at, and admoniſhed in this work; and I'm confident none but the Guilty will be concerned, and take it to themſelves, which I deſire they may, and amend.</q> Is not this cobweb eaſily ſeen through?

               </p>
               <p>HE is not content with having thus acquainted us with the great value of his ſecret, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf are poſſeſſed of it, in his epiſtle, but alſo mentions and recommends it over and over, <hi>ad nauſeam uſque,</hi> through the whole of his remarks on this work, for fear the Midwomen ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Mr. Mauriceau ſo much, that they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his <hi>Noſtrum,</hi> E.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman in his eſſay on Midwifery, 1733. ſays, Dr. Chamberlen's ſecret was the Forceps. Then makes the following quaint obſervation on the fore-mentioned remark: <q>Here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very odd methinks, in applying this ſecret to both theſe caſes, as equally ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to either, the caſes differing ſo very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0202500700:17"/>widely, and requiring a quite different method: For the head preſenting, and far advanced, is to be taken hold of by the Forceps, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracled; when a child which preſents an arm, is to be turned, and ſo brought away by its feet;</q> i. e. without either hooks or ſharp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
               <p>WHENCE its evident, Mr. Chapman did not apprehend the Doctor's view in applying his ſecret to the arm as well as the head. It was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the better to puzzle the cauſe, the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his Noſtrum, that he applies it to two caſes, between which there is not the leaſt analogy. He might as well have ſaid, it would be of great uſe in extracting the ſtone, or in drawing teeth.</p>
               <p>MR. Mauriceau, pag. 204. <q>The arm is to be twiſted off, if the child be dead.</q> Dr. Chamberlen, <q>Good if the child be dead; but it may be always done without.</q> Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly it may be often done without twiſting it off, but not with his Forceps. Mr. Mauriceau, ibid. <q>Before you uſe the Crotchet, be ſure the child is dead.</q> Dr. Chamberlen, <q>this caveat is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to thoſe who underſtand the art aright.</q> i. e. only the Noſtrum-mongers. Dr. Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, <q>The uſe of the crotchet may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at when the child is dead; but becauſe the moſt careful may often times be miſtaken, it cannot be approved of; as appears in the tranſlator's epiſtle to the reader.</q> Dr. Chamberlen, pag. 226. <q>Tho' the Crotchet cannot hurt a dead child, yet it may endanger the woman by ſlipping:</q> So may a Lancet, Traphine, or any other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0202500700:18"/>in the hands of thoſe who don't know how to uſe them.) <q>Wherefore the tranſlator of this treatiſe cannot approve of it, having an eaſier and ſafer way to do this operation, as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his preface to this book.</q> Dr. Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, pag. 227. <q>All this <hi>(viz. the uſe of the Crotchet)</hi> were to no purpoſe, if others had the art to do it, as the tranſlator can, and mentions in his preface to this book.</q>
               </p>
               <p>DR. Chamberlen, pag. 229. <q>Thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are very unſafe for the woman;</q> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, when in unexperienced hands, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are not at all dangerous;) <q>and having a better way, I cannot paſs them without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting my diſlike.</q> Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 194. <q>It's a great queſtion, whether a living child ought to be deſtroyed to ſave the mother?</q> Dr. Chamberlen, <q>This queſtion is out of doors, for the reaſon given in the foreſaid preface.</q> I'm afraid this will prove but a very bad reaſon in ſome caſes, notwithſtanding it's laid down with ſuch a magiſterial and dictatorial air, as I ſhall prove at a more proper time. Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 195. ſays, <q>It is always better of two evils to chooſe the leaſt, ſo we ought always to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the mother's life before the child's.</q> Dr. Chamberlen, <q>This chapter might be very well ſpared, if every practitioner had the art the tranſlator profeſſeth in his epiſtle, of fetching a child, when it comes right, without hooks, or turning it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF turning will do, there is never any occaſion for hooks, or for his ſecret either. Thus you ſee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0202500700:19"/>with what fulſome repetitions, what nauſeous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations of his Noſtrum, he has ſtuffed his remarks; but has not made one remark, that can be of any advantage to our Midwomen; and ſeems to have had nothing elfſe in view through the whole, but to tell them when they ought to ſend for him, and to let them know, that he, &amp;c. could ſerve them better than any body elſe.</p>
               <p>OUR tranſlator, like all the reſt of the Secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, has given a better character of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum, than I fancy it deſerves. E. G. He has taken a great deal of pains, and uſed all his art to perſuade us, that he, &amp;c. can fetch a child, which preſents right, at all times, and in all circumſtances, without hooks, or turning, &amp;c. but how this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates with the two following caſes, (one of which is tranſlated by the Doctor himſelf, and the other is recorded in Mr. Mauriceau's 26th obſervation,) I leave the reader to judge.</p>
               <p>MR. Mauriceau, pag, 198. tells us, that <q>in the year 1660, while he practiſed Midwifery in the Hotel Dieu, one of the Deputies had a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe Child ſhe could not poſibly bring forth further than its head; therefore called the head Midwife to her aid; who likewiſe uſed her utmoſt ſkill but in vain: And when they had both thus tir'd themſelves in pulling the head, I came in accidentally, and they deſired me to examine, and find the cauſe why the child could not be drawn forth with all their ſtrength, which was ſufficient to have drawn forth the ſhoulders, if they had been as big again as they were; which having conſidered, I immediately
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0202500700:20"/>conceived the difficulty to proceed from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: I then put my hand into the womb, up to the child's ſhoulders, which ſeemed ſmall enough to paſs with eaſe, therefore I concluded that the hindrance was not there.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After that, I put my hand farther up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it's belly, which I found very much ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a dropſy. I therefore told them that it was impoſſible ever to deliver the woman, until the water was emptied by piercing the belly: But not having a Crotchet in my pocket, I ſent to another Surgeon of the ſame hoſpital, and told him the ſtory, adding withal that the child could not be born, unleſs an orifice was made to empty the belly: but he would not take my advice, imagining he could extract it with his hands; but he ſoon ſeparated the head from the ſhoulders, the Midwives having almoſt done it before. Afterwards he fell to work with his Crotchet, and in about three quarters of an hour brought away both arms, ſeveral ribs, heart, and lungs, and tired himſelf heartily, yet in all this time, he had never opened the Diaphragma, nor Abdomen, which I adviſed him to do every moment, without which it was impoſſible to draw forth the reſt of the body. Then he gave me the Crotchet, telling me I might weary my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as he had done; which I willingly accepted, knowing very well, that inſtead of amuſing myſelf, as they had done, by pulling it, I ought only to pierce the infant's belly to let out the waters, after which all the reſt would eaſily follow. I then introduced my left hand as far
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0202500700:21"/>as the ſide of the infant's belly, and then with my right guided the Crotchet upon it, to the ſame place, then turned its point, and ſtruck it into the infant's belly, ſo that I made a hole big enough to receive the ends of my two fingers, with which I ſtretched the orifice, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters guſhed out, ſo that with one hand I eaſily drew out the reſt of the body, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Surgeon, whom I could never perſuade that the infant was ſo full of the dropſy. I filled the belly afterwards, through the hole I had made, and it held about five quarts. I have ſet down this ſtory, that other Surgeons may know how to behave on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PRAY what could Dr. Chamberlen have done with his Forceps in this caſe? But the following ſtory will more clearly ſhew, that he himſelf has been foiled, SECRET AND ALL.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Of a woman who died with her child in her womb, which could not be extracted by an Engliſh Phyſician who undertook to deliver her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>ON the 19th of Auguſt, 1670. I viſited a little woman, about thirty-eight years of age, who had been in labour of her firſt child for four days, the membranes being broke the firſt day of her illneſs, and yet there was hardly any dilatation of the mouth of the womb. I ordered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0202500700:22"/>her to be blooded, and in caſe that did not encreaſe her pains, to give her a decoction of Senna, in order to excite them; which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo well, that next day the womb was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently dilated. Nevertheleſs, it was nor poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deliver her. The infant preſented it's head, but could not advance into the paſſage, becauſe of the ſtraitneſs and bad formation of the bones of the Pelvis, which made it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to introduce my hand tho' I have a very ſmall one, or any other inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I could deliver her. I therefore declared to the good women, that it was not poſſible to deliver her at all, except by the Caeſarian ſection, which I did not care to meddle with, &amp;c. But ſoon after I left her, there was an Engliſh Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, named CHAMBERLEN, recommended by ſomebody to viſit her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>WHEN he came and heard how it was, and what had paſſed, he ſeemed exceedingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized that a Man of ſo much experience, as I was reputed to have, could not deliver her; yet, for all that, he aſſured them, that he would deliver her in leſs than half a quarter of an hour, let the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be what it would: Accordingly he ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the work, but inſtead of finiſhing it in half a quarter of an hour, as he had promiſed, he worked above three hours, (SECRET AND ALL) without any intermiſſion, except to breath a little now and then. And at laſt, having ſpent, to no purpoſe both his ſtrength and art, and ſeeing the poor woman ready to expire in his hands, he was obliged to give it up, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0202500700:23"/>declared alſo, that it was not poſſible to deliver her. The poor woman died with her child in her belly about twenty-four hours after he left her: Upon opening the body, I found the womb pierced and tore in ſeveral places, by the inſtruments that Phyſician had blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed without the guidance of his hand, which being much larger than mine could not be introduced. Nevertheleſs this Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian had come from England to Paris, about ſix months before, in hopes of making his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He gave it out that he had a particular ſecret for delivering children when the head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and bragg'd that he could lay the moſt troubleſome and dangerous in half a quarter of an hour. Nay, he had even propoſed to the king's firſt phyſician, that if he would give him 10000. crowns he would diſcover his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. But the bad ſucceſs of the fore-mentioned caſe put him ſo much out of humour, that he returned a few days afterwards to England.</q>
               </p>
               <p>DOES not this ſtory ſhew how little dependance there is upon ſecrets, tho' never ſo poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended? Does not this ſhew how cautious people ought to be in believing of them? Does not this ſhew, that, tho' they may be really uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſome caſes, yet they are not ſo in all, as they commonly pretend?</p>
               <p>PREFACE. <q>I ſhall now take leave to offer an apology for not publiſhing the ſecret I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have to extract children without hooks, where other artiſts uſe them, viz. there being my father and two brothers living, that practiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0202500700:24"/>this art, I cannot eſteem it my own to diſpoſe of,</q> 
                  <hi>(a pretty and reaſonable excuſe indeed!)</hi> "nor publiſh it without injury to them; <hi>(but there was not a word of this when he was bargaining with the French king's firſt Phyſician,)</hi>
                  <q>and think I have not been unſerviceable to my country, altho' I do but inform them that the fore-mentioned three perſons of our family, and myſelf, can ſerve them in theſe extremities, with greater ſafety than others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF Ward's Pill, or any other quack medicine, was found by experience, to be generally of uſe in this, that, or t'other diſeaſe, it may be ſent with proper directions, to all parts of the kingdom; ſo that the moſt diſtant inhabitants would have almoſt the ſame benefit of it, with thoſe among whom Mr. Ward lived; and conſequently Mr. Ward might very juſtly ſay, that (notwithſtanding he would not diſcover what his medicine was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, becauſe it would be worth ſo much year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him and his ſucceſſors,) yet his country was obliged to him, for telling them where they might purchaſe ſo beneficial a remedy.</p>
               <p>BUT how few in the whole community could be the better for all the manual operations in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, four Men could perform? Can four Men deliver all the good women in England, who want their aſſiſtance, ſuppoſing they were to ride poſt night and day after them? Is there any proportion between the benefit the publick would receive from the quack medicines, and the ſecret manual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of four Men? What ſervice is it then to the country in general, for the Doctor to tell them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0202500700:25"/>that he and three others can ſerve them with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſafety than other Men?</p>
               <p>NEVERTHELESS I'm far from thinking, that the publick has any right to expect, that every private Man (who, at a conſiderable expence, and aſſiduous ſtudy, makes any conſiderable diſcovery in manual operations, which cannot be made uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally uſeful, as medicines may, and really are, except they are fully and diſtinctly explained,) ſhould always communicate <hi>Gratis</hi> the fruits of his labour and expence. No! they ought to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely rewarded, not only for the real ſervice they have done, but to encourage induſtry in others.</p>
               <p>BUT the Doctor offered to diſcover this ſecret to the French for ten thouſand crowns; pray why did he not make the ſame offer to his country? Had not his country better have given each of them ten thouſand crowns, than expoſed ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of beautiful women, and innocent children, to the danger <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>Dr. Chamberlen. pag. 221. ſays, <q>The Author, viz. Mauriceau,) you ſee was only a Surgeon.</q> Pray what would he have him be? a Doctor, an Apothecary, or what?

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0202500700:26"/>Dr. Chamberlen mean by this ſneer, this ſarcaſm? Eſpecially when Mr. Mauriceau is then talking as much to the purpoſe, as ever he, or any body elſe did, on that ſubject, viz. that when a woman has a violent flooding, &amp;c. the beſt way to ſerve her, is to deliver her as ſoon as poſſible, whether at full time or no? Prove the contrary who can.</p>
               <p>IN pag. 172. he explains himſelf a little more plainly. Mr. Mauriceau ſays, <q>A Surgeon ought always to endeavour to bring the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alive.</q> Upon which the Doctor makes the following moſt inſolent remark, <q>And therefore undertake what he can ſafely perform, and what he cannot, leave to others that may,</q> (pray who be they, Doctors, Apothecaries, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or Noſtrum-Mongers?) <q>for life is not to be played with.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IS not the good which Surgeons do their patients as evident as the Sun? E. G. When they cut for the ſtone, when they perforate the ſcull, reduce a luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. neither of which can be affected only by the ſtrength of nature. But as the learned and honeſt BAGLIVI frankly owns, <q>It's often doubtful whether the cure, ſuppoſed to be performed even by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the firſt rank, was moſtly owing to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the medicines, &amp;c. which they directed.</q> E.G. "In fevers, ſmall pox, conſumptions, &amp;c." What ground had he then to charge the Surgeons with playing with life? The Doctor owns, pag. 14. <q>That Surgeons only practiſe Midwiſery in France;</q> and ſo they do, or ought to do, every where elſe.</p>
               <p>BUT how far the Doctor went out of his own ken, when he talked to Surgeons in ſuch a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202500700:27"/>and dictatorial way, in matters merely chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical, the three following caſes will evidently demonſtrate. Caſe 1. Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 344. ſays, <q>That children's gums ought to be cut with a Lancet, tho' Nurſes ſometimes do it with their Nails.</q> Yet our commentator ſays, <q>A thin groat <hi>(a ſmall piece of ſilver)</hi> is as good or better than either.</q> Whence it's evident, our tranſlator was only a Doctor. Notwithſtanding he takes upon him to direct the Surgeons in ſuch an imperious and dictatorial way; yet in this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he betrays himſelf, and plainly ſhews, he did not underſtand this very little part of Surgery, even ſo well as the very Nurſes. The method he propoſes is ſo far from being better than Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau's, he takes upon him ſo freely and publickly to correct, that it is worſe than that uſed by the old women, as will appear at ſight, to every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per judge. Caſe 2. Mr. Mauriceau, pag. 227. ſays, When by the firſt faſtning of the Crotchet, <q>the head is drawn a little lower, you may looſen it out of the firſt place, to faſten it further up, that ſtronger hold may be taken and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively removing and faſtening of it till the head is quite born, &amp;c. Dr. Chamberlen, "This is needleſs and dangerous, in caſe Crotchets be uſed, unleſs they loſe their hold.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CAN any thing expoſe a Man's judgment more than finding fault in the wrong place? Would not this remark convince any Man that he had never uſed a Crotchet, nay, that he did not know how to uſe it? The Doctor himſelf allows, that Crotchets are abſolutely neceſſary in ſome caſes, and conſidering
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0202500700:28"/>his large ſhare of practice, it's impoſſible but ſome of theſe very caſes muſt fall in his way. Pray what did he do then? Did he uſe the Crotchet himſelf? or did he ſend for a Surgeon to uſe it for him? Caſe 3. Of a violent Flooding. Mr. Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau, pag. 89. <q>The woman being put into a proper poſture, the Surgeon having well greaſed his hand, introduces the end of his fingers into the mouth of the womb, then opens them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to dilate it,</q> (i. e. by little and little, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either great violence or hurry,) <q>wide enough to admit his whole hand; then, if the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are not broke, let him break them; then, tho' the Head preſents, let him ſearch for the feet, and draw it forth by them, becauſe there is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hold, and more eaſy to deliver by them, than by the head, or any other part of the body.</q> Dr. Chamberlen, <q>Without it could be done without hooks, as mentioned in the preface of the tranſlator.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF this is not puzzling the cauſe, if this is not amuſing and confounding people inſtead of inſtructing them, pray what can be called ſo? Is not bringing the child out by the feet, as Mr. Mauriceau directs, bringing it out without hooks? Beſides, don't every body know, that it may be quicker brought away by the feet than by the head; and that the ſooner the woman is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the ſooner the flooding will ſtop? Is not this making good, bad? Is not this finding fault where there is none? Don't this prove that Mr. Mauriceau was a good and faithful Surgeon, and that Chamberlen was only a — Doctor.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0202500700:29"/>
               <p>THUS, upon the whole, I think it's evident, that Dr. Chamberlen's main deſign, in his preface, and notes upon Mr. Mauriceau's book, was to puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle, rather than inſtruct the Midwomen or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to perſuade them, that he, and the reſt of the Noſtrum-mongers, could ſerve them better than any other artiſts; and to repreſent Phyſicians, tho' unacquainted with almoſt every other part of Surgery, as fitter perſons to deliver women in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour than Surgeons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In 1734. Dr. HODY publiſhed 225 Caſes in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, written ſome years before by the late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and experienced Mr. WILLIAM GIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FARD, Surgeon and Man-midwife. In which he has given the following account of the IGNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE of the Midwomen, and its fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>CASE I. <q>I Was fetched to the wife of a chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and found one arm of the child ſunk down without the outer orifice, and the ſhoulder and ſide ſo engaged, and ſunk ſo low, that I could neither return the arm, nor with all my ſtrength move the other parts to fetch it by the feet. Another Man-midwife — had been there before me, who at firſt would not attempt any thing without a ſum of money was laid down; <hi>(a great piece of inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity too many are guilty of,)</hi> but upon aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances that he ſhould be paid, he worked upon the poor woman, and left her in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than he found her. (Thus you ſee Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0202500700:30"/>are not all witches any more than the Midwomen.) However this was the ſtate I found her in, which gave me occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand the Midwife, telling her ſhe had not ſent for help in time, and not till ſhe had work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her, which had occaſioned thoſe parts to be funk ſo low, and ſo ſtrongly engaged, that I could neither return the arm, nor paſs my hand (the whole paſſage being ſtopped up on every ſide) to fetch it by the feet; which might have been very eaſily done had I been ſent for in time. The caſe being ſo deſperate at firſt, I was at a loſs where to begin: Her pulſe was very languid and low, and ſhe was in cold ſweats, ſo that I fear'd ſhe would die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fatigue and pain ſhe muſt of neceſſity undergo. Then he twiſted off the arm, and with great difficulty extracted the reſt, of the infant with his Crotchet; yet after all this woman recovered.</q> Q. 1. Whether one in fifty recovers after ſuch a job? Q. 2. Whether this bad poſture of the child, the great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and danger of the mother, might not have been prevented, nay, and the child's life ſaved, had a ſkilful Midwoman attended?</p>
               <p>Case II. <q>The child was born dead, which is generally the fate of thoſe children whoſe Placenta offers firſt,</q> (Madam du Tertre, head Midwoman in the Hôtel Dieu at PARIS, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of one of the beſt books on this ſubject, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1677. ſays, the Placenta offering before the child, is the moſt certain ſign of its being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0202500700:31"/>dead,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Entre les ſignes qui nous font connoiſtre que l'enfant eſt mort, le plus certain eſt lorſque l'arriere-fais eſt ſorty avant luy. <bibl>
                           <hi>Inſtruction familiere, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </bibl>
                     </q>
                  </note>) <q>if a proper perſon be not at hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them immediately.</q> Who can be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who is ſo likely to be in the way as a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Midwoman? But as long as they want ſkill to perform it, the child muſt die before a Midman can be brought.</p>
               <p>CASE III. <q>The Midwife informed me, that the navel-ſtring was thruſt into the Vagina, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Os internum, but could not inform me what other part preſented. Many Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives are ignorant of the method of TOUCHING, which oftentimes occaſions very great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes both to mother and infant, and ſometimes is the death of both, but moſt commonly of the child <hi>(Is not deſtroying one bad enough?)</hi> which being for ſome time engaged in a wrong poſture, and the waters gone off, the Uterus is ſo collapſed, it gives great trouble to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, much more pain to the mother, and very often, as I ſaid before, occaſions the death of the infant; all which may be prevented if a ſkilful operator is ſent for in time.</q> But much better, if a ſkilful operatrix attended.</p>
               <p>CASE IV. <q>I viſited a woman who had been ſome days in labour, and the Midwife affirmed that the waters run off the preceding day, and that ſhe thought a foot preſented, but upon my touching I found it to be the hand bent back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0202500700:32"/>wards in the paſſage, and protruded out of the inner orifice up to the ſhoulder.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE V. <q>The Midwife told me that one hand and the arm was ſliped down into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, and that it had laid ſo for ſome hours, and the waters, ſhe ſaid, were gone of ſeveral hours before the hand was protruded. I rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her (as he very well might) for not ſending ſooner; ſhe alledged, for excuſe, that her labour might have ſucceeded in time: Then I told her that it was impoſſible, in the poſture the child preſented, it could ever be born.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE VI. <q>The Midwife told me, that one child had been born, and another remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that the membranes, with the waters, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forwards, and were very tight at every pain; but the woman having flooded very much after the birth of the firſt child, the Midwife could not tell me what part of the ſecond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. I Blamed the Midwife for not ſending for me ſooner, &amp;c. Whereupon I paſſed up my hand, and found the membranes much extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the waters, and the legs of the infant (which the Midwife knew nothing of, not knowing how to touch) preſſed forward into the Vagina.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE VII. <q>Upon examining the Midwife, at my firſt coming, how the child preſented, ſhe anſwer'd, &amp;c. This convinced me of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife's ignorance in the method and knowledge of touching, and I could wiſh it was not too common. I have generally found them igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in this point, which often occaſions the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0202500700:33"/>death both of Mother and infant,</q> (Why did not he do his endeavour to amend this great evil? What ſignifies finding fault with them in every page without attempting a remedy?) <q>and gives a great deal of pain to the Man-midwife.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE VIII. <q>I was ſent for to a woman, whoſe child was brought out to the ſhoulders, where it had ſtuck for about three hours; the Midwife not knowing how to draw out the arms and the head. They had alſo ſent for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Midwife before I got there, but ſhe knew not how to extricate the child out of this ſnare. Then I extracted it, but the child was dead, which could not otherwiſe be expected, ſince it had been ſo long held in that poſture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE IX. <q>I firſt enquired of the Midwife, how matters ſtood in general, but ſhe giving me no ſatisfactory account, I deſcended to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I then aſked her if the membranes were broke, and if ſo, how long before; to which ſhe could not give a ready anſwer, ſo that I found her thoroughly Ignorant. I next enquired how long the navel-ſtring had been fallen down; Her anſwer was, ſeveral hours. I told her, i. e. rebuked her, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE X. <q>I was ſent for to a perſon, whoſe child was born, and the Placenta left behind. Upon my coming there, the Midwife told me that ſhe had attempted, by all methods ſhe was miſtreſs of, to fetch it, but could not ſucceed: Wherefore, conſidering the length of time, from the bringing of the Foetus to my coming, I thought no more time ought to be loſt; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0202500700:34"/>put up my hand, and found the inner orifice ſo much contracted, that at firſt I could ſcarce paſs up the ends of my two fore-fingers, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time I dilated it ſo much, that I was able to paſs my hand, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Caſe will ſhew us, what difficulties people often fall into from the Ignorance of the Midwife, in not knowing how to paſs their hands as ſoon as the Foetus is protruded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XI <q>I found the Scalp was extended and ſeparated from the Cranium. This I judged to have proceeded from the Midwife's top rudely handling the head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XII. <q>The Midwife being very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, was not able to give me a ſatisfatory account of the caſe. I found the Labia Pudendi very much ſwell'd, &amp;c. wherefore Irebuked the Midwife, telling her, that when ſhe had done all the miſchief ſhe could, then ſhe perſuaded them to ſend for me: This is a common fault amongſt them, not being willing to have further help, 'till matters are come to the laſt extremity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XIII. <q>I thereupon paſſed up my hand into the Vagina, and found the parts ſomewhat ſwell'd, by the Midwife's too rudely handling them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XIV. <q>Upon paſſing my hand, I found the Midwife had been too buſy, for the arm was ſunk low, and much ſwell'd; not knowing better, ſhe had endeavoured to bring it away in the poſture it preſented; whereupon I Rebuked her, telling her, that by her ſo doing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0202500700:35"/>ſhe had made bad work, and ſhew'd her, that it was almoſt <hi>(he might have ſaid altogether)</hi> impoſſible to bring it away in the poſture it came in.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XV. <q>This caſe ſhould be a caution to Midwives to ſend for help in time, when a child comes Footling, and not to venture (unleſs they are very ſkilful) to bring it forwards.</q> But whoſe fault is it they are not all very ſkilful? Why are they ſuffered to practiſe, who are not very ſkilful? Would not Madam du Tertre have laughed at any Man, who ſhould have told her, ſhe muſt not venture to bring a child forwards when the feet preſents? Are not our women as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being taught as the French women?</p>
               <p>CASE XVI. <q>I came, and the Midwife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Novice in her profeſſion, was not capable of giving proper directions. She ſhould have adviſed the labouring woman to have, kept back, as much as poſſible, her throws, and not forced downwards, and ſhe ought to have paſſed her hand up, and preſſed againſt the child's buttocks, to retain it from ſlipping down, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the pains preſſed forwards;</q> (<hi>or, which would have been much more to the purpoſe, put up her hand, laid hold of the feet, and brought it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by them;</hi>) <q>but the Midwife neglecting to give this advice, or to act in this manner, I found the hip of the infant, with the Scrotum, ſunk low into the Vagina, and ſtrongly engaged between the bones of the Pelvis, ſo that I could not move it by any means.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0202500700:36"/>
               <p>CASE XVII. <q>I found things very bad, which in a great meaſure proceded from the Ignorance of the Midwife; I therefore rebuked her for her careleſſneſs, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XVIII. <q>I enquired of the Midwife, if the waters were broke, how long they had been gone off, and what part preſented; She told me that the waters had been run off ſome hours, but what part preſented ſhe knew not. I ſoon perceived her Ignorance; for upon paſſing my ſingers, I found the membranes protruded by the waters beyond the Os internum, into the Vagina, about the bigneſs oſ a pig's blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that the waters were not gone off, as ſhe ſaid, for ſome hours, and being Ignorant of the method of touching, it was impoſſible ſhe could tell what part preſented.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XIX. <q>I was call'd about ſix in the morning, and the Midwife told me, that the Membranes were broke, and the waters flowed off about twelve o'clock at night, and that the firſt part which preſented was the elbow. I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked her for ſtaying ſo long before ſhe ſent for help, and I ſoon diſcovered her Ignorance; for ſhe told me that ſhe had delivered ſeveral children where the arm came firſt, in the ſame poſture, and ſome were born alive, &amp;c. The child was born dead, which I imagined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from its lying ſo long in the poſture I found it, and the Midwife's too rudely pulling the arm when it firſt fell into the paſſage, in hopes, as ſhe thought, to have brought away the child in the poſture it preſented. By her
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0202500700:37"/>violent pulling ſhe had almoſt ſeparated the arm from the ſhoulder.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THIS is one amongſt the Many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that occur from the ignorance of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives: Had I been ſent for as ſoon as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes were broke, and before the ſhoulder, by reiterated pains, was ſo ſtrongly locked between the bones of the Pelvis, moſt of my trouble, and the child's life might have been ſaved.</q> Undoubtedly! or if ſhe had had ſkill enough to have done it herſelf.</p>
               <p>CASE XX. <q>When I came I found the child protruded to the hips, which hung out beyond the Labia Pudendi, the Midwife told me that the waters run off about an hour before; that the child preſented with the feet firſt, and that when ſhe had brought it to the buttocks, it ſtuck there, nor could ſhe bring it any further. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked her for not ſending at firſt, when ſhe found it to preſent in a wrong poſture; but ſhe in excuſe, as is uſual amongſt them, told me, that ſhe had brought out many children offering in that poſture.</q> (<hi>She muſt indeed have been a very ordinary Midwife if ſhe had not.</hi>) <q>The child from its having lain ſome time ſo preſſed, was dead, which, I told her, was very probably ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her neglect, in not ſending ſooner, when ſhe was ſatisfied the child preſented wrong.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXI. <q>Upon examination of the child's head, I found a Tumour, about the bigneſs of a pigeon's egg, on its upper part, ariſing, as I judged, from the Midwife's too rudely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, or (<hi>which is much more probable</hi>) it's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0202500700:38"/>lying ſo long locked between the bones.</q> But it's their way to haul the Midwomen in, head and ſhoulders, guilty or not guilty.</p>
               <p>CASE XXII. <q>I Rebuked the Midwife for not ſending ſooner, telling her the danger ſhe had expoſed the poor woman to by her delay: She in excuſe, anſwered me, that ſhe had never had ſuch an accident before, altho' ſhe had been a Midwife above eleven years; however I found ſhe was very ignorant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXIII. <q>This caſe (viz. the Placenta being leſt behind, occaſioned a flooding) ſhould be a caution to all Midwives not to delay ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early, and not depend too far on their own ſkill and experience; for it's plain this poor woman died a Martyr to either the Midwife's Ignorance, or vain Opinion of her own Self-ſufficiency, which too much prevails amongſt them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXIV. <q>Paſſing my hand into the Vagina, I found the arm bent and broke, by the Midwife's too rudely handling it. The child was born dead, which proceeded, as I judged, from its long lying in ſo uneaſy a poſture, and from the Midwife's Ignorance, in not knowing how to keep up the arm, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXV. <q>Men-midwives frequently find great difficulty in paſſing their hand into the womb, when, from the Ignorance of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, they are obliged to fetch the Placenta after the child has been born ſome time, the Os inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num being upon theſe occaſions generally very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0202500700:39"/>much contracted.</q> Pray is not a Midwoman's hand eaſier paſſed at firſt, than a Midman's at laſt.</p>
               <p>CASE XXVI. <q>One foot preſented; but the Midwife (thinking herſelf capable of delivering the woman, being in her own opinion very Self-ſufficient, altho' ſhe was very ignorant,) would not at firſt ſend for aſſiſtance, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXVII. <q>As ſoon as the Midwife found that the hands preſented, ſhe ſent for me. This is what Midwives ſeldom do;</q> (<hi>a black ſwan indeed!</hi>) <q>truſting too much to, and depending upon their own Sufficiency, which very often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the loſs of the child, and ſometimes of the mother.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXVIII. <q>The Midwife's Ignorance, in not knowing how to paſs her hand, occaſion'd this uneaſineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXIX. <q>This is one among the many misfortunes that attend a Man-midwife, when he he is ſent for too late, proceeding from the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, ſupineneſs, ignorance, or ſelf-ſufficiency of the Midwife; which laſt prevails in moſt of them, and is very often the occaſion of the loſs either of the mother or child, or ſometimes both.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXX. <q>The Ignorance of the Midwife, in not knowing how to keep up the womb from being forced before the head ſo low into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, was what added ſo much to my difficulty in delivering this woman.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXXI. <q>When I came, I found all but the head was protruded beyond the Labia Pudendi, but that ſtuck above, altho' the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0202500700:40"/>had pulled ſo ſtrongly, that ſhe had near ſeparated the body from the head. The Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, being Ignorant, did not take care to turn the child's face towards the Spine of the mother as the body advanced. However, I brought it out in a minute's time, this ſurprized all that were preſent, becauſe the Midwife had been working above an hour, without making any advance. Had I been there early, I might very probably have ſaved the life of the child, but Self-ſufficiency, join'd with an idle Notion that they ſuffer in their character if they ſend for a Man's aſſiſtance, generally prevents moſt Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives from ſending early, by which they too often endanger the lives of both mothers and children, and give no ſmall trouble to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midwife.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXXII. <q>The Midwife could not fetch the Placenta, for as ſhe was ignorant in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of paſſing her hand into the Uterus, up to the body of the Placenta, to examine whether it adhered to it, ſhe had only pulled by the end of the ſtring which hung out, and ſo had very near broke it cloſe to the Placenta; ſhe had made no Ligature upon the end of the ſtring, therefore a Hemorrhage had enſued, and the woman had loſt a great quantity oſ blood. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives very often depend too much upon their own judgment, and think themſelves Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſo that they poſtpone ſending for help in time, whereby the poor women become Victims to their Ignorance or Self-conceit.</q>

               <p>CASE XXXIIL <q>The Child's arm preſented ſeveral hours before I was ſent for; upon which I rebuked the Midwife for not ſending ſooner; but ſhe, to juſtify herſelf, had the Aſſurance to to tell me, that ſhe had brought out ſeveral children preſenting in that manner; whereupon I ſhewed her the impoſſibility of it, and adviſed her for the future always to ſend for help, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould find the hand to preſent firſt, and not, by pulling the hand, draw it further down, and engage the ſhoulder in the paſſage, as ſhe had now done.</q> Pray would it not have been much more ſeaſonable advice to have ſhewn her how to paſs her hand, and get hold of the feet, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>CASE XXXIV. <q>The Nurſe came and told me the child was born, but the Midwife was ſoiled in her attempts to fetch away the Placenta. I went, and found the Midwife was both igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the cauſe of its being retained, and the method of paſſing the hand to extract it; yet I brought it away whole in leſs than half a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute's time, which much ſurprized both the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the by-ſtanders, the Midwife having ſpent ſo much time without being able to effect it.</q> Sometimes a Man gets more credit by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing than by a difficult operation!</p>
               <p>CASE XXXV. <q>The Man-midwife's being ſent for ſo late, too often proceeds from the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Self-ſufficiency of the Midwife, (<hi>but oftener from the modeſty of the women, covetouſneſs, or real poverty of the men, &amp;c.</hi>) who either not knowing how to behave in difficult caſes,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0202500700:42"/>or fearing ſhe ſhould ſuffer in her character ſhould ſhe deſire aſſiſtance, puts off the calling in of a Man-midwife to the laſt extremity, ſo that the mother and child too often become vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims either to her negligence or ignorance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXXVI. <q>The Midwife depending upon her own Sufficiency, (altho' ſhe was very ignorant) had let the child advance too far, without taking care to turn and bring the face backwards towards the Os Sacrum, and had for ſome time endeavoured to bring out the head, but to no purpoſe; wherefore I was at laſt ſent for, and found the parts very dry, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſwelled, by the rude Handling of the Midwife.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXXVII. <q>The woman had been in labour forty-eight hours; the Midwife being very Ignorant, could neither tell me how the Child preſented, nor at what time the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes broke, but anſwered me, according to her dialect, that it was a dry labour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXXVIII. <q>The child was brought into the world all but the head, where it had ſtuck two or three hours before I came; the Midwife being very Ignorant, was not able to do the buſineſs herſelf, nor would ſhe ſend for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in time, ſo that the child was loſt, and the mother narrowly eſcaped.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XXXIX. <q>The Midwife, in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring away the Placenta, had inverted the Uterus, for I found the whole body of the Uterus, with the Placenta, adhering to it's Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, hanging out beyond the Labia Pudendi;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0202500700:43"/>I Rebuked the Midwife for not ſending ſooner, and told her, that ſhe, thro' her Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, was the immediate cauſe of this woman's death. Before I examined her, the Midwife told me, that the Placenta was partly brought out, being ignorant that ſhe had alſo pulled out the womb, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XL. <q>But the Midwife by pulling the Navel-ſtring too rudely, had broke it off near the Placenta, which was left in the womb. As ſoon as I came, I paſſed up my hand, where I found the Placenta entirely ſeparated from the Uterus, and partly protruded into the Vagina, ſo that I readily brought it away, and in ſo ſhort a time, that the people that were preſent were greatly ſurprized. Had the Midwife under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how to have paſſed her hand, ſhe might eaſily have brought away the burden before; and for want of this knowledge, ſome women fall into violent floodings, whence faintings, convulſions, and death.</q> A wonderful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed! But does ſhe deſerve the Name of a Midwoman who could not have extracted it as quick as he?</p>
               <p>CASE XLI. <q>Had I been ſent for before the membranes were broke, the waters paſſed off, the arm ſlipped down, and the back part of the ſhoulder ſo rivetted, I might not only have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Child, but prevented the Mother's ſuffering ſo much pain, and have likewiſe ſaved myſelf much fatigue and trouble.</q> Without doubt!</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0202500700:44"/>
               <p>IT'S too true, that many Midwives are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant "of the method of touching," (<hi>and it's as true they might with very little trouble be taught;</hi>) <q>and therefore are incapable of judging in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Child preſents, until an arm, or ſome other part is protruded into the Vagina, which is often ſo locked between the bones of the Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, that it is ſcarce poſſible to remove it; and too often they depend ſo much upon their own ſufficiency, and delay ſending for aſſiſtance in time, that both the mother and child, but more frequently the latter, die martyrs to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XLII. <q>I was ſent for about two in the morning, the Midwife had delivered the Child about ſix the evening before, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, notwithſtanding all her endeavours, to bring away the Placenta, ſhe at laſt left the woman, telling her, that it would in time come away, and that ſhe had known it retained four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days without any inconveniency; but as this was a doctrine I was a ſtranger to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the contrary well ſatisfied that inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies might attend, ſhould it not be ſpeedily drawn away; therefore —.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CASE XLIII. <q>The child's arm was ſlipped out into the Vagina, which, as ſoon as the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife obſerved, who was firſt ſent for, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that a Man-midwife ſhould be ſent for, telling thoſe that were preſent, that it was not a Midwife's buſineſs; whereupon another Midwife was ſent for, who pretended to do the work of a Man-midwife, and at firſt gave them aſſurances
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0202500700:45"/>that ſhe would deliver her, but after ſhe had worked upon her for half an hour, or longer, puting her into ſeveral poſtures, as kneeling, ſtanding, &amp;c. ſhe left her in a much worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than ſhe found her; for being ignorant of the method of delivery, when a child offered in the manner this did, ſhe truly had endeavoured to draw the child forward in the ſame poſture it preſented, whereby ſhe had drawn the hand out, and part of the arm, beyond the Labia Pudendi, and almoſt ſeparated it at the ſhoulder. The temerity, joined to the ignorance of this Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, very much encreaſed the difficulty of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. If I had been ſent for in time, I might with much more eaſe have delivered the woman, and withal have ſaved the Child. I have meet with ſome Midwives, who have had the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and aſſurance to tell me, that they have deliver'd children thus preſenting, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing them by the feet.</q>

                  </note>. Madam Lovys Burgeois, whoſe book was tranſlated into Engliſh, and publiſhed in London 1698. ſays, ſhe put it forth for the ſole uſe of the Midwives. Is it poſſible theſe Midwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and many more who might be mentioned, could have the inſtruction of the Midmen chiefly in view? Why would not he believe their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration?</p>
               <p>PREFACE. <q>I have daily, during the ſpace of above twenty years practice, ſeen many fatal miſtakes committed by Midwives,</q> Pray what ſort of Midwives muſt theſe have been, who committed fatal miſtakes every day, for above twenty years together? Ought they not to have been reſtrained from practiſing? Nay, even puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the civil magiſtrate? — <q>which I think
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0202500700:47"/>could not have happened had they ever read a treatiſe ſo properly adapted to their capacities, and at the ſame time ſo full and plain, as the following.</q> Q. Whether, if they had read Madam du Tertre's little book, they would not have found it more properly adapted to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, as full and plain, and her ſentiments more accurately expreſſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>MY greateſt aim in it is faithfully to inſtruct, and point out to them, thoſe dangerous Rocks on which many have been caſt away; that they may either be able to give better Aſſiſtance themſelves, or at leaſt to ſee the danger time enough to call in ſuperior advice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this formal declaration, &amp;c. I'm afraid his greateſt Aim will appear to be much the ſame with Dr. Chamberlen's, viz. to tell the Midwomen when, and in what particular caſes, to ſend for his ſuperior advice; and not to inſtruct them how to give better advice themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have met with ſeveral Midwives, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this Metropolis, that are extremely well qualified. However, (<hi>well or ill qualified</hi>) I muſt beg leave to give them this one piece of advice, viz. That where any material difficulty occurs, they would readily, and in time, call in our aſſiſtance; as when a child preſents with it's head, but does not, with a proper degree of pain, fall any lower; when the poſture happens to be wrong, and conſequently the child requires turning;</q> (<hi>May not the poſture be wrong, and yet not want turning?</hi> E. G. <hi>when the fect or hips pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. May not the poſture be wrong, and the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0202500700:48"/>Midwoman as able to turn it as any Midman?</hi>) <q>but more eſpecially that they would not delay to ſend for a Man in caſe of Floodings, or other threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Symptoms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PRAY can this be called inſtructing them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as he propoſes in his Exordium? or telling them when to ſend for ſuperior advice? Is it not plainly, declaring, as the Doctor had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in his opinion, they know no more of the matter, than to receive a Child which comes away, as it were of itſelf, without any the leaſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty? Would he not, had he deſigned to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them Faithfully how to give better aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance themſelves, explained to them, how, and after what manner, to remove all theſe difficulties, and threatning Symptoms he ſuppoſes, inſtead of only telling them to ſend ſpeedily for ſuperior advice? But pray what are the poor Midwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to do in places where no ſuperior advice, i. e. no Midmen, are to be had? He has made no proviſion for them, as Dr. Chamberlen did, pag. 5.</p>
               <p>AFTER giving his directions when he thinks they ſhould ſend for ſuperior advice, he firſt coaxes, and then threatens them, as the Doctor did above.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I believe this advice will not be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent by the moſt experienced Midwives, who, by the by, I have ever found moſt ready to call in farther aſſiſtance; and indeed they find their account in it; whilſt it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with thoſe, who, from too great an opinion of their own judgment and abilities, run great
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0202500700:49"/>hazards, or at the beſt call us in too late, and ſo loſe their good name, and juſtly ſuffer in their reputation. The beſt Midwives ſend early for advice upon the appearance of danger and difficulty; the ſuffering Fair readily conſents to it, and by this means both lives are ſaved.</q> Pray are not theſe two ſpeeches both picked out of Dr. Chamberlen's preface? Pray would not the ſuffering Fair have been much more obliged to her Midwoman, if ſhe had performed the work herſelf, and thereby ſaved her both the uneaſineſs and expence of ſuperior advice?</p>
               <p>NAY in the following paragraph, he takes off the maſk, and plainly tells them, he has got a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret which he muſt keep to himſelf. Pray is keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Secrets conſiſtent with his former declartion, pag. 42. viz. My greateſt aim is faithfully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>WHEN the head preſents, and ſticks in the paſſage, it can only be extracted, with ſafety to the child, by a Fillet, or the Forceps. The former of theſe I muſt beg leave to be ſilent in, as being entirely an invention of my own,</q> (<hi>ſub judice lis eſt.</hi>) <q>nor ſhall I, I hope, be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for my ſo doing, any more than the Great Dr. Chamberlen was, for his chooſing to conceal the method, or ſecret, whereby he could extract children in this caſe without hooks, where other artiſts are forced to uſe them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WAS there ever ſuch an excuſe heard of? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Great Dr. Chamberlen acted a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous part in this affair, therefore Mr. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be excuſed for doing juſt the ſame thing.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0202500700:50"/>Might he not as well have ſaid, the Doctor had been guilty of Symony, or Sacrilege, and was not puniſhed for it; therefore he might, for that reaſon, expect the ſame grace, in caſe he ſhould take it in his head to commit the ſame crimes?</p>
               <p>IN pag. 71. he ſays, <q>Here I only paſſed a Fillet over the Head, and thereby delivered her of a living child. This method of extracting with a Fillet is an art known but to very few; (I doubt not, he'll find himſelf as much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this aſſertion, as he was when he affirmed, that he was the ſecond Engliſhman who wrote originally and profeſſedly on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and that all Books hitherto written on this ſubject were calculated more for the inſtruction of the men, than of the women, &amp;c.) "nor ſhould it ever be attempted, but by a very ſkilful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</q> Such as —</p>
               <p>PAGE 8. he ſays, <q>If the child offers any other part than the head, <hi>be what it will,</hi> the hand is to be paſſed gently into the womb, the Feet are to be ſearched for, the child to be turned, and that way to be brought forth.</q> Pag. 20. <q>A child preſenting with it's head is often to be turned, and delivered with the feet firſt, in all other poſtures whatever always with the feet firſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſe a Foot, or the Feet, preſent, what need have we then to paſs the hand into the womb to fetch them? And ſuppoſe the buttocks preſent, and are ſunk ſo low in the paſſage, that they cannot be puſhed back without danger; is it not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0202500700:51"/>much eaſier, ſafer, and quicker to ſlip the fingers over the bend of the thigh, or over the Oſſa Ilia, and draw it forward in that poſture, than to run the riſk of forcing them back to look for the feet?</p>
               <p>THO' it's plain from theſe quotations, that Mr. Chapman, notwithſtanding his twenty-five years practice, was perfectly unacquainted with this caſe; yet that good old woman, Madam du Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, &amp;c. deſcribes it very accurately, viz. that, when the buttocks preſent low in the paſſage, the child ſhould be extracted as it offers<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>PAGE II. <q>Sometimes the pain ſhall be ſtrong and true, the head of the child very low, and bearing forcibly down every pain; yet the mouth of the womb (loth as it were to open) ſhall be but very little dilated, even after many hours pain. E. G. I viſited a woman, who had been many hours in labour, the head of the child lay in the Vagina, ſo low in the pains, that the unſkilful Midwife, (who had never touched the mouth of the womb, which lay more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary backwards) had given hopes of delivery the very next pain. Here I did no more than
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0202500700:52"/>with my finger dilate and caſt the part (viz. the mouth of the womb) back, and ſo in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes opened the door, and releaſed the little priſoner.</q> Pray would not Madam du Tertre's finger have releaſed the priſoner as ſoon and as ſafely as his did? That there has been great difficulties oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the lothneſs of the mouth of the womb to open, viz. in elderly women, when callous, ſchirrous, &amp;c. no Man will will deny. But there is not the leaſt ſign of any difficulty or lothneſs of the mouth of the womb to open, in this caſe Mr. Chapman brings, to prove that the pains may be ſtrong and true, &amp;c. and yet the mouth of the womb, loth as it were to open, ſhall be very little dilated. The difficulty in his caſe conſiſted only in the unnatural ſituation of the Os Tincae, which prevented the head's preſſing directly on it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would have opened with all imaginable eaſe and ſpeed; as you ſee it did when he touched it with his finger.</p>

It is very certain however, that more than two inches of the ſtring itſelf from the Navel is unneceſſary; whereas I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known Midwives leave five or ſix.</q>
               </p>
               <p>HERE Mr. Chapman again fancies he has told us a ſecret, but if you look into that good old woman, Madam du Tertre, you'll find theſe words, "<hi>Elle nouera le cordon, ou ombilic à "deux doigts du nombril de l'enfant, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. ſhe muſt tie the ſtring two inches from the child's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.

               <p>PAGE 56. <q>I was called to a woman, who had lain ten or twelve hours with the head of the child born; but the Midwife being Ignorant of

                  <q>Now had an ignorant Midwife been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this caſe, who had only taken the firſt child and After-birth, the laſt would probably have been left behind;</q> (but ſuppoſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Midwife had been concerned, how would it have been then? Was there any ſuch great Feat done by him in this caſe, which ſhe could not have done as well?) <q>and ſo either violent floodings, or a bad fever would have enſued; and, as the woman was before very ill and extremely weak, it would very likely have coſt her Life.</q> Thus you ſee, let a Midwoman be preſent, or not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, guilty, or not guilty, it's all one, they muſt be hauled in, and condemned, for an imaginary, as well as for a real fault.</p>
               <p>PAGE 83. <q>I was ſent for in great haſte to a woman in labour, but on my arrival found her dead. I conjectured ſhe had died by flooding, but was told ſhe had not; however, the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife told me, that the After-birth ſtuck ſo faſt in one part, that ſhe was not able with all her ſtrength to take it from her. Upon which I deſired to ſee the corps, and found, to my great ſurpriſe, that the Matrix was inverted, and hung down between her thighs, with the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa adhering to its Fundus, which I ſeparated before the Midwife, and ſeveral Matrons there preſent, and convinced them all of the diſmal accident. This woman had it ſeems a very good and eaſy labour of the child; but then ſhe Midwiſe pulled hard at the Navel-ſtring, and ſo brought down the Matrix, which as ſoon as ſhe could take hold of, ſhe did; and then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0202500700:56"/>pulled with freſh violence, and not being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the loudeſt cries, the poor miſerable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fell into Convulſions and Deliquiums, and ſoon expired. This was a young healthy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut off in the bloom of life, and caſt into the cold arms of Death, juſt as ſhe was about to claſp her Firſt-born in her own.</q> A ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſe indeed!</p>
               <p>PAGE 84. <q>I have been called to three women, where I found the Vagina quite broke through in the back part, by the Midwife's rudely thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her hand, in order to come at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the womb, which in all theſe three hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to lie very forwards, under the Os Pubis. Two of theſe died in a few days after, and the other recovered, beyond my expectation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PAGE 86. <q>I was ſent for to a gentlewoman, who kept a tavern in Ipſwich. The child was Dead, and the mother Flooding. She was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by no leſs than two Midwives and a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, juſt then ſet out in the profeſſion. When they had all uſed their endeavours, to little or no purpoſe, I was called in, and delivered her in a minute. I left her under the care of Dr. Beeſton, but ſhe died in ſix or ſeven days.</q>
               </p>
               <p>MR. Chapman indeed has not told this young Gentleman's name, but has deſcribed him ſo well that I doubt there's not a Man in all Ipſwich, nor perhaps twenty miles round, but can tell who he means. What injury might not ſuch a tale do a worthy young fellow? but how conſiſtent this ſtory is with the advice he gives to others, pag. 114. I leave the reader to determine.</p>

               <p>PREFACE. <q>But the dignity of this art will appear to every perſon in a much more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous light, if we reflect on the LEARNING of the profeſſors of it.</q> E. G. Dr. C—, Dr. M—, Dr. W—, Dr. G—, Dr. A—, Dr. B—, Dr. Gregoire <hi>Tota notus in urbe!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE improvements theſe GREAT Men have made in this art, have effectually wiped away that load of Slander and Ignominy with which this profeſſion was formerly branded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PRAY have nor ninety-nine in a hundred of theſe GREAT Men he talks of, kept their improvements <hi>(if they ever made any)</hi> to themſelves? Don't moſt of them now, as well as He, pretend to have Secrets? Don't they endeavour to puzzle, at the ſame time they make a ſhew of inſtructing others? Don't they very ſeldom, if ever, conſult together, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ought to do in difficult or dangerous caſes? What can hinder them, except the fear of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſignificancy of their pretended ſecrets, or their real ignorance? Nay, Dr. Chamberlen himſelf pag. 91. blames them for this, and very juſtly obſerves, even with ſome regret, this great fault in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. <q>It were to be wiſhed rather than hoped for, that practitioners, in difficult and dangerous caſes, (whereof they have no certain knowledge) would conſult, and not deſtroy one or more, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking what they cannot well perform, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage patients from ſending for other help or advice; putting life in balance with their reputation.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0202500700:58"/>
               <p>I very readily agree with the Doctor, that practitioners in Midwifery ſhould conſult together, when any thing very difficult or dangerous occurs, with the ſame freedom and unreſervedneſs as in other caſes of Surgery, viz. Luxations, Fractures, Mortifications, &amp;c. Wherein conſiſts the diſreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſulting in this, more than in any other caſe? Are there not more lives concerned in theſe, than in any other caſes? Is not conſulting the only way of preſerving, inſtead of loſing their reputation, and the patients lives?</p>
               <p>IN 1735. Mr. Chapman publiſhed a Treatiſe on Midwifery; in the preface to which he ſays, <q>I own I had ſome aſſiſtance in regard to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and did not ſend my papers to the preſs until that was reviſed and corrected.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CAN he be a tolerable judge of diction himſelf, who ſuffers his friend to write Woman-Midwife, Women-Midwives, &amp;c. Words uſed by no body, except the learned Dr. Maubray, who Mr. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or his Corrector calls, <q>that ingenious and laborious author.</q> But to give a ſpecimen, <hi>firſt;,</hi> of his Ingenuity: he begins a large book, which he calls the whole art of Midwifery, &amp;c. Thus, Sect. I. cap. 1. Of God, cap. 2. Of Nature, cap. 3. Of Man, cap. 4. Of the Soul. Sect. II. cap. 1. Of Maidenhood, cap. 2. Of Virginity, cap. 3. Of the Virgin-diſeaſe, cap. 4. Of Love, cap. 5. Of Copulation, &amp;c. Now! pray what relation, what connection, is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe out-of-the-way ſubjects and Midwifery? Might he not as properly have introduced what he had to ſay about Midwifery, with an account of Rat-catching, Rabbit-breeding, or Sow-gelding?</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0202500700:59"/>
               <p>PRAY does it ſhew moſt Ingenuity or Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, to jumble ſeveral ſubjects together, which have no manner of relation, connection, or analogy with one another, or with his main deſign, by way of introduction? <hi>Secondly,</hi> of his Laboriouſneſs: I cannot but own that every page is laboured, but in ſuch a manner, that he often forgets, in leſs than a leaf, what he intended to account for or prove, and leaves you as much in the dark as he found you: and that he has ſpent a great deal of labour upon collecting from Romances, Popiſh legends, &amp;c. a parcel of idle, groundleſs, nay ridiculous tales, and tells them with all imaginable gravity, and ſeeming earneſtneſs; and very ſeriouſly undertakes to account for unaccountables. E. G. Page 58. he tells us, "St. Auſtin" (and who would not believe a popiſh ſaint, tho he aſſerted that he ſaw a Rabbit kitten Monkeys, Pole-cats, or Foxes? <q>writes of a Man who could ſweat whenever he had a mind. And I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe known ſome perſons my ſelf, who could weep and ſhed abundance of tears at will and pleaſure. <hi>Utrum horum?</hi> "Yea, and farther yet, many learned Authors<note n="*" place="bottom">Pontan, Amat. Luſitan, &amp;c.</note> teſtify, by divers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that Women have been turned into Men; which ſome attribute to the force of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, tho' I am no ways to queſtion the veracity of what ſo many excellent men have confirmed;</q> (Is there any other Man living, who
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0202500700:60"/>would not queſtion them?) <q>yet I think we may find more probable reaſons for't, than all the Powers of IMAGINATION. Whereof I ſhall mention that which ſeems to be the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional cauſe, viz. an extinguiſhed or latent FORMING FACULTY,<note n="*" place="bottom">Here. Sax. praelect. pract. part iii. cap.30.</note> which (however) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times has Exerted itſelf again, like the BLAZ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING of a raked or reſuſcitated Fire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I hope Mr. Chapman will explain this ingenious account of this incredible phaenomenon in his next edition, for, I muſt own, as it ſtands, it's far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my comprehenſion, and that the account he gives of it is ſo very ſublime, that it rather puzzles than inſtructs me. Pray what does he mean by "an extinguiſhed or latent forming Faculty?" And wherein lies the analogy between that, and "the Blazing of a raked or reſuſcitated Fire?"</p>
               <p>HE has been ſo juſtly and tartly reprimanded for the abſurd and falſe account of the Sooterkin, de Suyger, or Sucker, by the late reverend and learned Dr. Archibald Mitchel,<note n="†" place="bottom">The Sooterkin diſſected, 1726.</note> 
                  <hi>Utriuſque Medicinae Doctor,</hi> that I ſhall only add one obſervation to what he has advanced, viz. that Dr. Maubray had the aſſurance to aſſert, in the fore-mentioned book, pag. 376. that he had talked to ſome of the moſt learned Men, in the Seven Provinces, about this Sooterkin, de Suyger, or Sucker, and that they ingenuouſly told him, that it was ſo common a thing, that ſcarce one woman in three eſcaped this kind of ſtrange
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0202500700:61"/>birth; nay! and that his own practice among them afterwards confirmed it, ſo much, that he always as much expected the thing de Suyger, as the child itſelf! Is it not ſurpriſing that he did not catch a few of theſe little Daemons or Moodiwarps as he calls them, and keep them in a cage, rat-trap, or in ſome other more curious mechanical contrivance, for the conviction of Dr. Mitchel, and other infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels? Pray does ſuch a writer as this deſerve the epithets of ingenious and laborious? Wherein does his ingenuity appear? wherein is his labour of any uſe? Pray can any thing expoſe a Man's judgment more than laughing or hiſſing, praiſing or finding fault, in the wrong place?</p>
               <p>WHAT a ſplutter Mr. Chapman makes, pag. 59. about his breaking the Membranes of the ſecond child, in order to bring it away by the feet, as if he had diſcovered ſomething new. And then he tells us, he's not a little pleaſed to find Dr. Maubray agree with him exactly in this point, and adviſe this manner of proceeding, in almoſt the ſame words uſed by him on this occaſion, tho' the words uſed by Dr. M. are very different from his, nay, they are perfect nonſenſe. E. G. He ſays, I would fetch the ſecond child by the feet, in caſe the ſecond Flooding is not yet over, &amp;c. Pray what does he mean by the ſecond flooding? Mr. Chapman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth and ſaith, that by the ſecond flooding he muſt mean the flowing of the waters; but who, beſides he, ever called the flowing of the waters a flooding? Every body elſe means a dangerous flux of blood by a flooding. But if he had looked back as far as Madam du Tertre, &amp;c. he would have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0202500700:62"/>found that very method ſtrongly recommended, and much better, ſhorter, and clearer expreſs'd, than either he or Dr. Maubray have done it<note n="*" place="bottom">

Si elle remarque qu'il y a un autre enfant, elle noüera le cordon, ou ombilic à deux doigts du nombril de l'enfant, &amp; fera une ſeconde ligature à quatre doigts au deſſus de la premiere ligature; puis elle coupera le cordon entre les deux; apres qu'elle aura oſté &amp; donné l'enfant à quelqu'un, elle portera la main dans la matrice pour percer les mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, dans les quelles le ſecond enfant eſt contenu: S'il vient mal, elle ira chercher les pieds, &amp; ſi vient la teſte la premie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, elle preſſera la mere de faire quelque effort; car il eſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile à l'enfant de ſortir les paſſages eſtant ouverts: Mais ſi la femme eſt foible, &amp; qu'elle manque de courage, &amp; que l'enfant ſoit encore haut dans la matrice, elle ira chercher les pieds comme ſi venoit mal, cela ſe pouvant faire ſans aucun accident, pourveu que ce ſoient des perſonnes qui ſçachent leur meſtier.</q>

               <p>HE makes again, pag. 65. as great a rout about extracting the Placenta, for three pages together, as if no body had known any thing of the matter before he taught them. E. G. <q>The Placenta is never to be left to be ſhut up in the womb, whether the labour has been natural or not; and I have the ſatisfaction of finding Dr. Maubray recommending this practice.</q> A great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction indeed! But pray can he find any body who does not recommend it, as well as he and Dr. Maubray?</p>
               <p>HE cenſures Dionis pag. 68. for ſaying, <q>That the Placenta in an Abortion of two or three months, may be left to come away of itſelf.</q> Which undoubtedly may very often be done without any danger, tho' it's certainly ſafer to bring it away at firſt, if ſent for in time; but if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0202500700:63"/>the child has been come away ſome time, I ſhould give myſelf no trouble about it till a flooding appeared. Becauſe the irritation cauſed by the fingers, when the Os Tincae is almoſt cloſed, may be more apt to cauſe an inflamation, flooding, &amp;c. than letting it alone; nay, I knew it once left whole (by the obſtinancy of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who could by no means be perſuaded to have it taken away,) between the fourth and fifth month, and yet ſhe did very well. Nay that experienced Midman Mr. Giffard, is alſo of the ſame opinion, <q>Of two evils the greater ought to be ſhunned, there being leſs danger in leaving part of the After-birth, which will very often, without doing any great harm, come away with the Lochia, than in uſing any force in extracting it, by which we very often hurt the womb.</q> Pray can he imagine Mr. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis did not do the needful, in caſe a flooding did ſucceed?</p>
               <p>BUT he finds no fault with him, where I think he richly deſerves it, when he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Paris edit. lib. ii. cap. 15.</note> the Os Tincae in a violent flooding, is more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dilated with an inſtrument, and the falſe concept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. extracted with a pair of Forceps, than by the fingers. If this is not finding fault in the wrong place, pray what is? Is it not a moſt dangerous, nay, and unneceſſary practice?</p>
               <p>PAGE 171. He gives one inſtance of a child he delivered with the buttocks foremoſt. But pray
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0202500700:64"/>how does this quadrate with what he ſays, pag. 11. of the ſame book; <q>If the child offers any other part than the head, the hand is to be paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the womb, the feet ſearched for, the child to be turned, and brought forth by them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PAGE 174. <q>I was unwilling to have recourſe to art.</q> (Is it not the art of Midwifery, which the Midwomen have been taught, the only thing which diſtinguiſhes them from other women? Are not they obliged to make uſe of their art at every labour they are called to? Why then does he ſo often make uſe of the words Art and Artiſts, and only apply them to himſelf or ſome other Man? Won't any one who reads Madam du Tertre's little book be convinced, that ſhe has ſhewn more art and better diction, than either Dr. Maubray, or —. Does her being a woman make it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, ſhe had recourſe to art, or that ſhe was an artiſt.) <q>But after two hours trial, finding no advantage from her pains, I was forced to it. I firſt made an attempt with the Fillet; but the young creature's pulſe began to ſink, and her pains falling off a little, I choſe to take the moſt Speedy, as well as the moſt ſecure Method, viz. the Forceps, and delivered her in about two Minutes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PRAY is not this fairly owning, that the Fillet (he makes a ſecret of pag. 17.) is neither ſo Speedy, nor ſo Secure a Method as the Forceps? Why then does he keep it a ſecret? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe can he do it? When he, at the ſame time confeſſes the Forceps, (which he has given us a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0202500700:65"/>print of, tho' a very indifferent one, and nothing new therein,) to be preferable.</p>
               <p>THEN he goes on in the ſame page 17. and ſays, <q>But I have been told, ſince the firſt public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my Eſſay, that the Fillet is ſo far from being an invention of mine, that it its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, or at leaſt very frequently uſed. I own indeed, that it may be commonly uſed in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child, by ſecuring one foot with it, as I have directed; but do not believe the manner of paſſing it over the head to be ſo univerſally known and practiſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>DAVENTER, in the appendix to his Ars Obſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricandi, publiſhed in 1701. deſcribes and very much approves of a Fillet's being paſſed over the child's head in order to extract it. And I myſelf have ſeen eight or ten different ſorts of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and uſed by different practitioners. Pray was not Dr. Birch's Fillet put up to be ſold for 500 <hi>l.</hi> by the late excellent Surgeon Mr. Joſ. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's? Has not Dr. Sandys had one for many years? Nay I hardly know one who has not, in one ſhape or other, How then can Mr. Chapman expect to fob us off with ſaying, that all other people's are for the foot, and his only for the head? Muſt not he think us very weak, and very illiterate if we believed him? Might he not with as much reaſon aſſert, that he or Dr. Maubray were the firſt inventors of breaking the Membranes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond child, in order to bring it away preſently by the feet; or of directing the Placenta to be extracted before the Uterus cloſed upon it, or of tying the Navel-ſtring within two inches of the child's
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0202500700:66"/>belly, &amp;c. all which have been told us by Madam du Tertre.</p>
               <p>THEN he winds up the foreſaid Girl's caſe, pag. 174. with theſe ſolemn reflections on his own good conduct, and the miſhaps which would have befali'n this poor woman had not he been with her. <q>Had a Midwife been called to this perſon ſome days, not to ſay weeks, before, when her pains and complaints began to vary, and (as is common with young and unexperienced Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, put her upon her labour too early, which I carefully avoided) conſidering the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the child, what muſt have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence?</q>
                  <hi>(Something very frightful undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!)</hi> And even had a Man been called, who was <q>unacquainted with the uſe of that noble and ſafe inſtrument the Forceps, he muſt have deſtroyed the child.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſe a knowing Midwoman, ſuch a one as Madam du Tertre, &amp;c. had been with her, in the room of his young and unexperienced one, would not ſhe as carefully have avoided putting her upon her labour before her time, as Mr. Chapman did? And ſuppoſing a Man had been there who had no Forceps about him, but was well acquainted with the uſe of Daventer's, Birch's, or any other Fillet, except Mr. Chapman's Secret, (which he owns himſelf, pag. 59. would not do,) could not he have extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the child with as much ſafety as he did with the Forceps?</p>
               <p>MR. Chapman, pag. 95. tells us the following ſtory: <q>A fine young lady, in labour with her firſt child, was ſeiz'd with a flooding, and the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0202500700:67"/>arm of the infant preſented. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent for a Phyſician, who had lately taken upon him to practiſe Midwifery, BUT WAS SO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH THE ART, THAT HE NEGLECTED THE ONLY THING NECESSARY IN THAT CASE, viz. a ſpeedy delivery by turning the child; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed reſtringent or ſtyptick medicines. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome hours another gentleman was called in, but the lady was now very much weakened, and the artiſt, apprehenſive of her expiring under his hands, or immediately after delivery, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed too often happens, would make no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but abandoned her to her approaching fate. She lived ſome hours after, and then died. Im perſuaded it will be allowed by the beſt judges, that, had ſhe been immediately deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her life might have been ſaved. I received this account from a worthy matron, who was preſent during the whole time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>MR. Giffard mentions a caſe of the ſame kind, therefore I chooſe to place them together. <q>I was ſent for about five in the afternoon, to a woman at Batterſea, who had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of three children about three the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, but the Midwife had left the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthens, <hi>(monſterous and fatal ignorance)</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke off two of the ſtrings; ſhe not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to paſs her hand to fetch them, and being called away to another woman, had left her in this condition:</q>
                  <hi>(Could a Turk believe there were any wholſome laws in a country where ſuch barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were not ſeverely puniſhed?)</hi> Another Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0202500700:68"/>
                  <q>was ſent for, but ſhe would not attempt to bring them away, fearing the woman ſhould die, and her death be laid to her charge; <hi>(poor unhapy woman!)</hi> ſo when I came I found the woman in the agonies of death, her whole maſs of blood being drained away by the continual flooding, (viz. <hi>for fifteen hours</hi>) I immediately brought them away, but the woman's blood and ſpirits were ſo much exhauſted before, that ſhe expired in leſs than an hour afterwards; ſo that this woman fell a ſacrifice to the ignorance of one Midwife, and the timidity of the other, for had the burthens been brought away at firſt, before ſhe had loſt ſo much blood, ſhe had been in no danger of dying. They had ſent for one Dr. —, at —, who inſtead of adviſing them to fetch the burthens away, or coming himſelf to do it, had ſent forcing Medicines, which would of conſequence encreaſe the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo haſtened her death. The three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were all born alive and well.</q> Who can read this caſe without being ſhocked at it?</p>
               <p>HAS any of the fore-mentioned women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted greater Blunders than theſe Doctors? Is it not evident from theſe ſtories, that the Doctor or Apothecary Midmen, are ſometimes as ignorant as the loweſt claſs of Midwomen? Pray where could theſe Doctors have been admitted to their degrees? Muſt it not have been in ſome popiſh country, where orthodoxy is reckoned a better recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the knowledge of diſeaſes? Where viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapels three or four times a day is thought more conducive to the making a good Phyſician,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0202500700:69"/>than frequenting the hoſpitals as often? Don't this ſhew that we want a proper ſchool for Midmen as well as for Midwomen?</p>
               <p>MR. Chapman, pag. 31. tells us of <q>A woman who had been twice or thrice delivered by a Man, of children that always preſented with the head, which the operator took a fatal freedom with, viz. uſing a hook,</q> (Pray how could he tell, who was not preſent, but that all theſe children were dead? That he was obliged to uſe a hook, becauſe of the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the child's head, ſhoulders, or belly? That he was forced to deſtroy the child to ſave the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Wherein then conſiſts this fatal freedom he talks of? Ought not a Man to be very ſure before he accuſes another after this manner?) <q>at laſt ſent for me.</q> I think he's much to blame for not telling us, whether this fatal freedom taker was a Doctor or an Apothecary Midman?</p>
               <p>THAT excellent Anatomiſt Dr. Nicholls, in his Compendium Anatomicum, publiſhed in 1733. and republiſhed 1736. has the following remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſage, <q>
                     <hi>In omni malo ſitu, ut &amp; in rebus deſperatis, pedibus extrahetur Foetus.</hi>
                  </q> i. e. In every wrong poſture, as alſo in deſperate caſes the child is to be extracted by the feet.</p>
               <p>Now, pray is it not a wrong poſture when the buttocks preſent? And yet the child may be brought away with great ſafety both to it and the mother when they preſent, without looking for the feet, vid. pag. 46, 58, &amp;c. The caſe may alſo be very deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and yet not poſſible to bring the child away by the feet. E. G. When the head is too large and ſticks in the paſſage, when the head is born,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0202500700:70"/>but ſticks becauſe of the largeneſs of the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or when the belly is full of water, as in the caſe mentioned pag. 14. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>DR. C—writes thus, 1720. <q>
                     <hi>Cum Vagina ſit nimis anguſta, vel pelvis naturaliter parva, vel Foetus ſolito major, una nonnuquam continua rima ſeu ſciſſura ab vulva ad anum, fit, quod valde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculoſum eſt &amp; mulierem, ſi evadat, in poſterum ſterilem reddit.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS caſe I have found, by repeated expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, not to be at all dangerous, in perſons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe healthy; and am ſatisfied that it will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute as little to making them barren as a broken leg.</p>

               <p>THUS you ſee what a number of children have been loſt, what a number of women have ſuffered great and needleſs pains, and have been brought into the utmoſt danger of their lives, nay have actually fallen Martyrs, Sacrifices, or Victims, as they term it, in the very flower of their age, to the imprudence and ignorance of Midwomen, nay, and Doctor Midmen, vid. pag. 62, 63. and theſe only from the accounts of what fell under the cogniſance of two Midmen, viz. Giffard and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But pray how high may we ſuppoſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count might have riſen, if every Midman, &amp;c. who practiſed in England, ſince the end of the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, i. e. thirty-five years back, had alſo made up their accounts? What a black liſt would it be? Is it not ſhocking to think on't? Are not theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0202500700:71"/>of their blunders enough to frighten the women from ever truſting to a Midwoman any more? But if the Midwomen in, and about London and Weſtminſter, are ſo generally and ſo groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as thoſe gentlemen have repreſented them, what muſt they be in the country? What havock muſt they make among his Majeſty's ſubjects? What numbers of fine women and children muſt daily fall a ſacrifice by the very hands, <hi>proh dolor!</hi> from whom they expected relief? Is not this a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and deplorable caſe? Is it not an evil which demands both a ſpeedy and an effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? Can any thing better deſerve the attention even of the Legiſlature itſelf? But granting their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to be as great as they ſuppoſe, pray will calling of names, ſuch as Rude, Rough, Negligent, Ignorant, Fooliſh, Novice, Obſtinate, Over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Supine, Unſkilful, Conceited, Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Errand Midwives, &amp;c. or Rebuking, Blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Checking, and Reprimanding, &amp;c. theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſo liberally beſtowed upon them, make them more prudent or judicious, or enable them in any degree to give better aſſiſtance themſelves, and thereby put a ſtop to the great evil they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſo loudly? Surely no!</p>
               <p>PRAY have theſe Gentlemen Complainants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed any other method, to prevent for the future, this calamitous, this diſmal, this inhuman practice, except to ſend for one of them, upon every little trifling difficulty? Is not this making mere Nurſes of the Midwomen, and — of their patients? Is it not telling them plainly, that they neither do, nor ever ſhall know any more of the matter, by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0202500700:72"/>any information they will give them, than (<hi>what they knew before</hi>) juſt to receive a child which drops into their hands? Nay it's much worſe, it's making mere Jack-calls of them; i. e. They muſt hunt about in ſearch of Their prey, and then ſend for Them to devour it. But theſe gentlemen's ſcheme, of being conſulted upon every little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, is, and always will be, impracticable in many caſes, even in London it ſelf, and much more in the country, even tho' the Midwomen were as much at their Beck as they themſelves could deſire? 1. Becauſe ſome women are ſo unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly modeſt, or obſtinate, that they cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on, on any account, to admit of a Midman, until it's too late. 2. Becauſe ſome huſbands are as much againſt having their wives laid by Men, as they themſelves are. 3. Becauſe ſome people are ſo very covetous, that they will not ſuffer a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be ſent for ſoon enough to do any good. 4. Becauſe ſome people are ſo very poor, that they cannot bear the expence of a Midman. 5. Becauſe ſome Midmen are ſo very inhuman, that they won't touch a poor woman, except they are paid firſt, vide pag. 24. 6. Becauſe ſometimes Midmen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be got in time, &amp;c. What would They have the poor Midwomen do in theſe caſes? Are They to be blamed for other people's Tempers, Opinions, or Inhumanity? Tho' They have been often to blame, yet they are not always blameable. What then muſt we do? Muſt we always employ Men? Or continue to ſtand idly by, and ſuffer our wives and children to be thus cruelly maſſacred by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unhallowed hands? Muſt we never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0202500700:73"/>the cure of this Malignant and moſt Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſtemper, by which ſuch numbers have been, and daily are deſtroyed, becauſe no body has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto endeavoured to do it? No! We muſt apply an effectual remedy, if it can be found, Charity Humanity, and the ſtrongeſt ties of nature (viz. the preſervation of our wives and children) oblige us to do it.</p>
               <p>BUT how? What Method will, or can, effectually prevent the diſaſters complained of above, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? The ignorance of the Midwomen is, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the principal, if not the ſole cauſe of theſe dire events; and their unſkilfulneſs is certainly owing to their want of a proper education, and not to their want of capacity, and conſequently is more their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than their fault. Therefore, the only method by which this fatal diſtemper can be cured, and all its bad conſequences for the future avoided, is to put it in the power of the Midwomen to qualify themſelves thoroughly, and at a moderate expence, in all the parts of their moſt neceſſary office, before ever they are permitted to practiſe: (And then they, who did not readily embrace the opportunity, would not only be deſervedly blamed, but ought to be puniſhed by the civil Magiſtrate:) E. G. They ought to be well inſtructed, 1. In the knowledge of the nature and ſituation, not only of the parts of generation in women, but alſo of the circumjacent parts which may be affected by, or may obſtruct delivery; and with the nature and uſe of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, Waters, Navel-ſtring, Placenta, &amp;c. of the Foetus. 2. In the cauſe and cure of theſe diſorders and accidents, peculiar to women during their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0202500700:74"/>pregnancy, and after their delivery. 3. In the art of Touching, (to the want of which, moſt of the blunders complained of above, were owing, viz. leaving the Placenta behind, Dragging the womb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide out, Miſtaking the arm for the foot, the Hips for the Head, Thruſting their fingers through the Vagina, &amp;c.) whereby they can not only tell the preſent ſtate of the woman at any time of her geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo even prevent many of the difficult and dangerous labours (being always ſent for ſo early) which now happen; E. G. The membranes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke, and often before, they may certainly tell by the touch, what parts preſent, then ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it is the navel-ſtring, hips, hand, or any other part but the head, advancing in a right poſture, they may at firſt appearance (the parts being then ſo moiſtened by the waters) be eaſily put back, the feet ſought for, and the child extracted by them: Whereas, when they have not art and jugement enough to take this favourable opportunity, nature her ſelf offers; the woman is ſpent with fruitleſs pains, the child advances in a wrong poſture, or too ſlowly, if in a right one, her body grows dry, the womb collapſes, and contracts ſo cloſely about it, and the child is ſo jammed, and locked between the bones of the Pelvis, that it cannot be extracted without the greateſt difficulty and danger, by the moſt dexterous hands. And how many fall under, or ſoon after ſuch operations, the fore-mentioned caſes abundantly ſhew. Pray is it not much eaſier and ſafer to prevent ſuch blunders, than to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thecure of them afterwards? 4. In the moſt rational Methods of delivering women, at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0202500700:75"/>any time of their geſtation, of a child, falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or mole, with jugement, dexterity, and expedition. 5. In the knowledge of thoſe caſes where inſtruments are abſolutely neceſſary, that they may ſend directly for a Surgeon, inſtead of fatigueing the mother, and endangering both, by needleſs delays and fruitleſs attempts. 6. In the method of uſing them themſelves, where no Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon can be had. <hi>Preſtat anceps quam nullum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibere remedium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which method of qualifying themſelves, I doubt not the Midwomen will object and ſay, that they would readily be at any reaſonable expence and fatigue, to be ſo thoroughly inſtructed in all the parts of their office, as I propoſe: but it's not in their power, they have no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of following this ſcheme. How can they do it? The Midwomen cannot, and the Midmen won't inſtruct them. What then would you have them do? Can you blame theſe good women then, for doing as well as they can, nay as well as their Miſtreſſes who taught them the little they do know, tho' not ſo well as they would, had they had the opportunities of being inſtructed, as above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? To which I anſwer, I own their Plea to be juſt and reaſonable, until theſe opportunities are put in their power.</p>
               <p>THE Midmen, I doubt not, will object and ſay, that the Midwomen want both Capacity and Strength (inſtruct them as ye pleaſe) to perform what I propoſe. To which I reply, That this is only an artful and groundleſs inſinuation, and do affirm, (<hi>ore rotundo, plenis buccis</hi>) that it's not want
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0202500700:76"/>of Capacity, Docility, Strength, or Activity, but merely want of fit and full inſtructions in all the parts of their office, which diſables them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, in all caſes (excepting where inſtruments are neceſſary) with as much Eaſe, Safety, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the moſt dexterous Midman; which is evident to a demonſtration, from the ſucceſsful practice of the Midwomen in the Hotel Dieu at Paris, (the beſt ſchool for Midwomen now in Europe) where they hardly ever want the aſſiſtance of a Surgeon, excepting where inſtruments muſt be uſed: Which is frankly owned by Monſieur de la Motte, who ſays, that during the ſpace of ſix months, wherein he attended amongſt the women in the Hotel Dieu at Paris, there was but one hard labour happened where there was the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a Surgeon, and even that was at laſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by nature; and in that time there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four hundred delivered, almoſt all by the Apprentices, and very rarely by Madam du Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, who was then firſt Midwife. I have alſo been informed lately, by a correſpondent at Paris, that there are now about two thouſand women delivered in that hoſpital, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Surgeon, excepting as above. Would not any perſon then be deſervedly laughed at who ſhould aſſert, that our women are not as capable of performing their office, had they the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as the French women?</p>
               <p>BUT this charge of the Midmen will appear ſtill more groundleſs, if we conſider the nature of the blunders they are charged with by Dr. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlen, Giffard, and Chapman, in the caſes before
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0202500700:77"/>mentioned, viz. of Pulling at the child's arm, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Matrix, Miſtaking the hand for the foot, Leaving the Placenta behind, Being ignorant of the art of Touching, &amp;c. &amp;c. Pray do theſe charges prove their want of Capacity, Docility, or Strength? Surely no! All that can be reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from them, is, that they want a proper edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is their misfortune more than their fault, and what I'm endeavouring to put in their power to have. Pray is there a Midwoman in England ſo ſtupid, as not to be eaſily convinced, that pulling at the arm is wrong and to no purpoſe; that tugging too hard at the Navel-ſtring, or laying hold of the fund of the womb, inſtead of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa, will invert the Uterus; or, that miſſing their time to take away the Placenta, when the paſſage is open, makes it both difficult, painful, nay, and dangerous to extract it afterwards; or that could not with proper pains be inſtructed, to act rationally in theſe or moſt other caſes? Pray is there any branch of Surgery in which ſo many of the family of — have been and are engaged, as in the buſineſs of Midwifery? (Yet ſome of them are very learned and knowing Men.) An affair of ſuch vaſt importance to mankind.</p>
               <p>How can it be made appear, that Doctors, Apothecaries, and the loweſt claſs of Surgeons, who are as little acquainted with the other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal operations of Surgery, as the very women them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are more capable of performing theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations than They, who have much more practice, and many of them as good capacities? Pray where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts the ſecret? It requires no Mathematicks,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0202500700:78"/>no ſkill in Philoſophy, no Univerſity learning at all, otherwiſe moſt of the Midmen would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as well as all the Midwomen. Has not all ages produced women who have made a figure in the moſt ſublime parts of learning, and in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of curious and uſeful arts; and alſo illiterate thick-headed Prieſts, Lawyers, and Phyſicians? All which is occaſioned by nothing ſo much as having, or wanting, a proper education. <hi>Why then, is it not rational to ſuppoſe, that they might alſo be made capable of aſſiſting their own ſex, at that time when it is leaſt proper for Men to come near them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT now to come to the main point, viz. How the method I propoſe for the regular inſtruction of the Midwomen, can be put in execution? To which I anſwer: 1. That an hoſpital be erected, E. G. in London or Weſtminſter (at the publick expence, by donation, or ſubſcriptions, as ſeveral Alms-houſes, Infirmaries, Hoſpitals, &amp;c. of far leſs conſequence to the Commonweal, have been and are daily carried on) for the reception of about two or three hundred poor women who are big with child. 2. That a proper number of Midwomen be appointed to attend them. 3. That two Surgeon Midmen be appointed to aſſiſt theſe Midwomen in all extraordinary caſes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ſtructure of the parts concerned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the art of touching, &amp;c. as above, in ſet lectures, at leaſt three times a week, to all the Midwomen and their apprentices who pleaſe to attend. 4. That every young woman, who deſigns to practice Midwifery,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0202500700:79"/>ſhall be obliged to attend theſe courſes during her apprenticeſhip; then go and practiſe, for a ſet time, under thoſe expert Midwomen in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital: Afterwards let them be examined as to the ſkill and knowledge they have acquired in their profeſſion, by the two Surgeons, (ſince our <hi>Dom, fac. totum</hi> take Midwifery either to be no part of Surgery, or ſuch a trifling part of it, that it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their notice; notwithſtanding ſome of them can diſtinguiſh, to a mathematical exactneſs, how many grains of more knowledge in Surgery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a Surgeon of a firſt, than of a ſecond rate Man of War,) and ſix or ſeven other perſons, appointed by his majeſty, (becauſe I don't think it reaſonable, that ſo many people's bread ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the humour and caprice of any two Men only,) and if approved, to receive from them a certificate of their fitneſs to practiſe in London or any where elſe. 5. That, until fit Hoſpitals can be built and endowed, a Midman be appointed in every city, or county-town in England, to read the foreſaid lectures to all the Midwomen in the county, and demonſtrate to them the truth of their doctrines on the poor of the neighbourhood, of which there are plenty every where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this, or ſame ſuch</hi> SCHEME, <hi>was put in execution, in the principal town; of the kingdom, I'm ſatisfied, in a very few years there would hardly be an ignorant Midwoman in England, and conſequently the great agonies, moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuffer at the very mention of a Man, would be almoſt entirely prevented; the great expence they coſt ſaved;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0202500700:80"/>and the melancholy ſcenes above-mentioned, would be no more ſeen nor heard of. What can be more Deſirable? What can ſhew more Humanity? What can be more Charitable, than to purſue a Deſign, whereby the lives of ſo many innocent children, and valuable women, may be yearly, nay daily, ſaved from deſtruction?</hi>
