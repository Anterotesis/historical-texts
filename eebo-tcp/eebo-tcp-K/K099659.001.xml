            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE indefatigable means you took to convince me of your friendſhip, by promoting the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trifles, made me take the liberty of inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to you; for indeed, I had ſcarce hinted my intention, when you took the earlieſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of procuring thoſe eſſentials, which have proved the means of my bringing them to light; I am perfectly convinced, that you have humanity enough to overlook the too many imperfections
<pb facs="tcp:0087400501:3"/>
you will meet with, if you ſhou'd have patience enough to read my little Analects; for from my connections in buſineſs, and the <hi>attention</hi> that I am, from an innate affection, oblig'd to pay my fire-ſide, have made me, in ſome meaſure, more <hi>inattentive,</hi> than I ſhould have been; I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted many, I could have wiſh'd to eraſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had not time to finiſh many pieces which I had begun; and indeed, I was out in my calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in what would furniſh a couple of volumes, but yet determined, not to extend it in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; I mean, not as is generally done on theſe occaſions, to give much paper and little printing; I often wiſh'd to have found you at my elbow, when I have ſent a proof to preſs, that you might have given a poliſh to the many rude, and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated paſſages I am afraid you will ſtammer at.—However, I ſhall truſt to your candour and good ſenſe, to make ſuch allowances, as you ſhall think neceſſary; and when I ſee you, I am ſure you will ſhew ſo much the gentleman, as to <hi>whiſper</hi> my errors to me, that no aſſiduous critic may know there is a fault, through you, when he has not capacity enough to find it out himſelf.—But this is rather unneceſſary, as I am ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0087400501:4"/>
convinced of your friendſhip and eſteem; for I always perceived, on thoſe occaſions, that you ſeemed happy, rather to throw a veil over an error in your friend, than expoſe it to the greedy ear of envy, for the ſake of ſelf-oſtentation, or the elevating plaudits of a ſelect ſociety.</p>
            <p>I was once in hopes, that the <hi>Nut-brown Maid</hi> would have made its appearance on the the ſtage, but Mr. GARRICK gave me ſo many ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why it would not do, (not altogether diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of merit) that I reſign'd my hopes with pleaſure, knowing, from the many material marks of friendſhip I have experienced from that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, if it had been perfectly calculated, he would have given it the faireſt chance in his power; therefore I printed it, hoping it might afford ſome little entertainment in the cloſet. You was pleaſed ſome time ago to ſend me a few corrections you had made, in what I had given you to look over, but by ſome accident or other, I had the misfortune to loſe them, which was of no little concern to me, as what they were, have eſcaped my remembrance, ſo that at leaſt I am convinced, you will meet with the ſame errors
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0087400501:5"/>
again; whence I thought it neceſſary to give you ſome reaſon, why I have not adhered to your amendments; but if ever a future opportunity ſhould offer, on the like occaſion, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be more careful.</p>

If I diſcover myſelf to her now, the ſudden tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grief to joy may kill her quite. Sweet maid take comfort.</p>

believes all women to be more fickle than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; this I've often heard him ſay; adding too, that if he could once find out a maid conſtant and ſincere in her affections to a proof, he would take her to his heart forever: I'll to him, and convince him of your ſincere regard and matchleſs love.</p>

of that advantage by giving the jailor the ſtricteſt charge never to place a pen and ink within my reach, or let one letter paſs the door, which action has often made me think he's play'd me foul.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>ONE Summer's eve, when ev'ry ſwain was hous'd,</l>
                  <l>When Sol had ſcarce one glimmer left behind,</l>
                  <l>Each little ſtar, faint glitt'ring, caſt a ray,</l>
                  <l>And ſpangled o'er the duſky robe of night.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Fond of the ſcene, I wander'd far from home,</l>
                  <l>O'er level lawns, and flower-breeding vales,</l>
                  <l>Till weary nature ſlacken'd in my ſteps,</l>
                  <l>And made me halt upon a friendly bank.</l>
                  <l>Calm thro' a bridge, there ran a peerleſs ſtream,</l>
                  <l>That ſcarcely mov'd the ozier's ſlender wand:</l>
                  <l>Here I took my ſtand, and view'd the ſolemn ſcene.</l>

The bat had been an hour on the wing,</l>
                  <l>Chaſing the night-fly and the buzzing gnat:</l>
                  <l>The purblind owl had left the antient tower,</l>
                  <l>Prowling with floſſy wing along the mead.</l>
                  <l>Anon, as out of Chaos, ſhot a ray</l>
                  <l>Of chearing light, quiv'ring o'er the hills,</l>
                  <l>As yet too weak to ſtruggle with the dark;</l>
                  <l>Or, as th' Egyptian queen, far off beheld,</l>
                  <l>Shot her firſt beams on the Italian ſhore,</l>
                  <l>Her brilliant train reflecting on the waves,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Clouds that o'er-hung the horizon, unſeen,</l>
                  <l>Appear'd in view, like ſilver-ſkirted troops,</l>
                  <l>Waiting the up-riſe of the queen of night.</l>

                  <l>Philomel now chear'd the embow'ring grove,</l>
                  <l>The woodlark too, miſtaking it for day,</l>
                  <l>Join'd her ſweet notes with emulating ſtrains.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Near to my left there ſtood an ancient pile,</l>
                  <l>By waſting time, and ſavage war defac'd,</l>
                  <l>Like a reduc'd and hoary-headed chief,</l>

Its roof was capt with velvet-grounded moſs,</l>
                  <l>And round its baſe, wild weeds and flowers grew,</l>
                  <l>The ſtinging nettle with the briars blend,</l>
                  <l>The ſecret haunt of adders and of toads.</l>
                  <l>Thro' the wide breaches of the rock-built walls,</l>
                  <l>Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down</l>
                  <l>Upon the verdant ſlope, in lines direct and clear,</l>
                  <l>Reflecting on a dimpled brook below.</l>

                  <l>A ſolemn ſilence now o'erſpread the globe,</l>

                  <l>And left a circle ſpreading to the brink.</l>
                  <l>Anon, as wind from out ſome hollow cave,</l>
                  <l>A deep-felt ſigh from out the ruins came,</l>
                  <l>As from a heart juſt burſting with its load,</l>
                  <l>Which ſtreight was anſwer'd with a voice of woe,</l>
                  <l>Like ſorrow ſoothing the more ſad deſpair.</l>

                  <l>At length reſolv'd, with caution I approach'd,</l>
                  <l>O melting ſight! my wounded heart ran o'er,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The wretched huſband on her neck reclin'd,</l>

                  <l>Feign'd a hope, tho' foreign to his heart:</l>

                  <l>His tears burſt forth, and bath'd his manly cheeks,</l>
                  <l>And on his bended knees he trembling fell,</l>
                  <l>Lifting his eyes with anguiſh 'gainſt the ſky,</l>
                  <l>With invocations loud, and agonizing ſighs,</l>

                  <l>Till his loud accents ſhook the vaulted roof,</l>
                  <l>And rift his tortur'd breaſt.—I cou'd no more,</l>
                  <l>But flying to his aid with heart diſtreſs'd,</l>
                  <l>He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me,</l>
                  <l>And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd;</l>
                  <l>Like the fierce tyger, aſſail'd by hunters,</l>

Shielding 'em from danger. With humble voice,</l>

                  <l>With mild compaſſion they beheld my ſtate,</l>
                  <l>And ſtrove to chear me with a friendly voice.</l>
                  <l>Diſmounting here, I would have enter'd in,</l>
                  <l>But that my feet their wonted uſe deny'd:</l>
                  <l>My limbs gave way, and let me to the ground;</l>
                  <l>When this dear fair came running to my aid;</l>
                  <l>She rais'd me up, and led me careful in,</l>
                  <l>And ev'ry day a true attendance paid:</l>
                  <l>When I was ſtruggling with the pangs of death,</l>
                  <l>And with conſoling hope, ſhe'd drop a tear,</l>
                  <l>Imploring heaven to preſerve my life.</l>
                  <l>Her ſupplications did at length prevail.</l>
                  <l>No ſooner had I conquer'd one compeer,</l>
                  <l>But found my heart was with another ta'en,</l>
                  <l>Love, to whom I ſoon ſubmitted, and embrac'd.</l>
                  <l>And made my hoſteſs partner of my life,</l>
                  <l>But here partaker in affliction too;—</l>
                  <l>Her father was a Briton, once of wealth,</l>
                  <l>And held a manſion in that happy iſle,</l>
                  <l>Till revolution and domeſtic broils,</l>
                  <l>Deſtroy'd his lands, and plunder'd all he had,</l>
                  <l>(Save a few ſtores, in fecret he had ſaved,)</l>
                  <l>Putting himſelf and family to flight,</l>
                  <l>To ſeek for refuge in a foreign land.—</l>
                  <l>The action robb'd the good man of his life,</l>

And in diſtreſs the mournful widow left,</l>
                  <l>With this fair comforter to buffet life,</l>
                  <l>And ſhield her from a baſe enſnaring world.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Here eighteen months I liv'd in ſocial joy,</l>
                  <l>And in the deſert found the deareſt wife.</l>
                  <l>The kindeſt mother ever man cou'd boaſt,</l>
                  <l>Her better ſpirits ſo outworn by grief,</l>
                  <l>That made her frame, like frozen lillies, fade,</l>
                  <l>Recline, and droop unto the earth again.</l>
                  <l>Not having heard one tiding from my friends</l>
                  <l>For many a day, then we for England made;</l>
                  <l>And ere we reach'd the ſhore, the wind blew high,</l>
                  <l>And frowning Neptune on the ſurface foam'd,</l>
                  <l>Throwing up wat'ry mountains in our way,</l>
                  <l>And, in his anger, daſh'd us on a rock:</l>
                  <l>Some twenty periſh'd in the yawning deep,</l>
                  <l>But we eſcap'd, to meet a harder fate.</l>
                  <l>We ſav'd our lives, but ſaw our cargo ſink:</l>
                  <l>No ſooner had I ſtepp'd with pleaſure on the ſhore,</l>
                  <l>But met the tidings of my father's death,</l>
                  <l>From one misfortune often comes a crowd,</l>
                  <l>For ſome malignant enemy of mine,</l>
                  <l>Inform'd the good old man I'd long been dead.</l>
                  <l>And ere he died, he choſe another heir.</l>

                  <l>Here, each glaring circumſtance aroſe,</l>
                  <l>And fill'd me with ſurpriſe: I aſk'd his name,</l>
