            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I CANNOT ſay that I am of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe, who wiſh, that if we have
a War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> they may beat
Us; becauſe it has ſomething in it ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
for an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> or a <hi>Britain</hi> to rejoyce
in the Deſtruction of his own Country, and
in the Triumph of our Neighbours of any
kind over Us, that he cannot ſee it without
Horror and Averſion; yet I cannot but ſay,
I wiſh <hi>thoſe,</hi> who talk with ſo much Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> would look
a little into the certain Conſequences of ſuch
a War, whether Victory or Diſadvantage on
Our Side ſhall attend it.</p>
            <p>I take a War with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to have
this very unhappy Circumſtance in it, That
if we are beaten, it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ruin imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and if we conquer, it may be our
ruin hereafter, ſo that in general, get or
loſe in the Field, we ſhall certainly loſe in
the War.</p>
            <p>The immediate Loſs of our Ships, of our
Men, of our Trade, and the farther load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Nation, with a mighty and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
Expence, are the common Topicks
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0635300100:3"/>
of thoſe who argue in the uſual Methods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this War; but though theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
and ſhall have ſomething ſaid to
them in their Courſe; yet theſe are the leaſt
of the Evils, which if our Fore-ſight is not
clouded by the Power and Influence of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
found, may be by neceſſary and inevttable
Conſequences, to follow the entring at this
time upon a War with the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Situation of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> their Strength
at Sea, their Poſſeſſions in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
and their reigning Influence in the
<hi>North</hi> and <hi>East</hi> Seas, are Reaſons why we
muſt expect uncommon Miſchiefs ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
our Trade in the beginning of ſuch a
War; this was always the Effect of a <hi>Dutch</hi>
War, and it was remarkable, that in the
laſt War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> we loſt 2000 Sail of
Ships great and ſmall the firſt Year: No
part of our Commerce is free from them or
out of their reach: On the contrary, ſome
of the beſt Parts of our Trade are in great
Danger of being entirely loſt to them, ſuch
as the <hi>East-India, African</hi> and <hi>East</hi> Country
Trades in particular; it is apparent, if a
due Enquiry were made, we ſhould ſee ſmall
hope of continuing and preſerving our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in them under a War with the <hi>Dutch;</hi>
their Collonies of ſuperiour Strength lying
ſo near ours in the two Firſt, and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Alliances in the latter, enabling them
effectually to ſupplant Us.</p>
            <p>The Diſturbance they always upon theſe
Occaſions gave us in our <hi>Home Trade,</hi> and the
impoſſibility of our carrying it on, but with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0635300100:4"/>
manifeſt Diſadvantage, is a ſtrong Argument
to open our Eyes in the Caſe of a <hi>Dutch</hi> War;
there are other Parts which reſpect our
Coal and Salt Trade, our Corn Trade, our
<hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Lynn</hi> Carriage, our Trade to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and our Fiſhing Trade: In all which,
the Interruptions of Commerce by a <hi>Dutch</hi>
War have been ſuch, as have been felt by
all our People.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen who are ſo fond of this
War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> have perhaps not yet
examin'd the Trading Conſequences of it,
and as they are Landed Men, and fancy
they are no way dependent upon Trade,
they have forgotten, what ſo often, and by
ſo many unanſwerable Arguments has been
proved to them, <hi>viz.</hi> That as Trade only
was the Original Cauſe of the encreas'd Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Lands, and the high Rents which
now the Gentlemen receive; ſo the decay
and ruin of Trade, muſt of courſe ſink the
Value of Land, lower the Rents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Tenant, to an incapacity to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Landlord; by which means, a War
will of courſe affect the Landed-man as well
as the Merchant: Wherefore the Landed
Gentlemen are deſired to give themſelves the
Trouble to enquire into the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as they are likely to be affected by
a War with the <hi>States General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Landed Men about
<hi>New Caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> will not be effected
by the interruption of the Coal Trade? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when Coals are at 4 <hi>l.</hi> a Chaldron at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0635300100:5"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> and on the Coaſts, it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
leſſen the Conſumption? And
whether in the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War the Quantity
of Coals carry'd out were not leſſen'd above
50000 Chaldron in a Year?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Landed Men borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon all the Coaſts, from <hi>Hull</hi> in the
<hi>North,</hi> to the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and on to the
Coaſt of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> will not be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Stop put to the vaſt Exportation
of Corn to <hi>Holland, &amp;c.</hi> the want of which
Sale, muſt of neceſſity make the Price fall
in <hi>England,</hi> by which the Tenant, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to get a Market for his Corn, is
diſabled to pay his Rent, or hold his Farm
without an Abatement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the Stop, put to the vaſt
Exportation of our Woolen Manufactures to
<hi>Holland,</hi> and which will be interrupted, if
not prohibited by a War, will not ruin Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of our Manufacturers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
leave the Poor without Employment,
and prevent or greatly leſſen, not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of Wool only, but the General
Conſumption of Proviſions, by which the
Landed Men's Eſtates, muſt of courſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and their Rents remain unpaid?</p>
            <p>Theſe Things, if it was imagin'd, any
Man could object againſt them might be
farther enlarg'd upon, and the particular
Trades which would ſuffer in ſuch an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0635300100:6"/>
of Commerce, might be examined,
where it would appear.</p>
            <p>That the great Trade of Broad Cloath,
Kerſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one of the greateſt Branches of
Trade in <hi>England,</hi> particularly at <hi>Leeds, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield,
Wakefield, Hallifax, Bradford, Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
and the adjacent Parts, and where it is
by modeſt Computation ſuppoſed, Four
Hundred Thouſand People are employ'd and
maintained in the Woolen Manafacture,
that this great Trade is principally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and ſupported by the Exportation to
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Stop to that Exportation, muſt
of neceſſity encourage the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the
Making the ſame kind of Goods in their own
Country, particularly at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where they
have for ſome Years endeavour'd it, and are
Daily improving.</p>
            <p>That above Two Hundred Thouſand
Pound Value of the ſaid Goods are Yearly
exported to <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the North-Riding of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of <hi>Durham,</hi> and great part of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi>
and <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> are ſupported, by
breeding and feeding Cattle, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuption
of the <hi>West Riding;</hi> and if the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Trade receive ſuch a Check, or Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Conſequence is evident; the poor
People will want Employ, which want of
Employ is immediately felt, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of Proviſions, and that again
in the Rent of our Lands: And indeed it
cannot be a little wonder'd at, to ſee the
Landed Men in this Nation, value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0635300100:7"/>
ſo much, upon their running down
our Trade, as if the Lands had no Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon Trade, or that Lands cou'd hold
up their Value, if our Trade were decay'd:
This Article of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, will ſatisfy
any reaſonable Perſon, that it cannot be;
I pray God, we do not too fatally try the
Experiment at this time, nor is this the leaſt
Reaſon why I mention this Argument at this
time, that our Landed-Men may learn to
know what made them rich, and what may
again reduce them to what they were ſome
Ages ago.</p>
            <p>It is true, Trade has given us no Land,
<hi>Britain</hi> is no larger than it was before; but
it is not unworthy our Thoughts, and may
be proper to recommend it to theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to conſider, That Trade has added a
new Value to what we had before; the Rents
of Lands are riſen in time to ſuch a Degree,
that what was formerly worth 10 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
is now worth 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and what has
done this? What, but our Trade? Our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Commerce, which had it been more
effectually covered, encouraged and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
would have been able to have done
much more.</p>
            <p>Come we next to ſpeak to the <hi>Corn-Trade;</hi>
this is more ſenſibly underſtood by thoſe
Gentlemen, whoſe Eſtates lye near the Sea,
more particularly upon the Coaſts of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,
Yorkſhire,</hi> and the ſeveral Countries
which border upon the <hi>Humber,</hi> or on the
Navigable Rivers, emptying themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Humber,</hi> as alſo upon the Coaſts of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0635300100:8"/>
               <hi>Norfolk,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Yarmouth, Cromer, Clye, Wells,
Burnham</hi> and <hi>Lynn,</hi> the Navigations of the
River <hi>Ouſe,</hi> and the Towns of <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and
<hi>Spalding</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely;</hi> again, on the
Coaſts of <hi>Suſſex, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> all which
Counties, find their Daily Advantages from
the incredible Quantity of Corn every Year
exported to <hi>Holland,</hi> without which Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
it would be impoſſible for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in thoſe Countries to vend the Corn
they owe, and by Conſequence, the Lands
in thoſe Counties, muſt either lye unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur'o,
or at leaſt be laid down, and only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in breeding of Cattle, a poor Trade
and which is now left to the <hi>Northern</hi> and
<hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and to the <hi>Highlands</hi>
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Conſequence of which
would be the leſſening the Value of Land,
ſinking the Rents, and reducing the Eſtates
of the Landed Men.</p>
            <p>Theſe would be ſome of the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Conſequences of a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
and are mention'd here, becauſe as Mankind
are more apt to be ſenſible of that Miſchief
moſt, which touches them ſooneſt; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be very reaſonable to expect, That
theſe People, however at preſent unaffected
with the Danger of a War with <hi>Holland,</hi>
may think fit to change their Minds, when
they examine more ſtricly into the thing,
and ſhall find, that they will be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch'd by it in the moſt ſenſible part.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other immediate Caſes,
in which a War with <hi>Holland</hi> will affect us,
in Matters of Trade, and which it having
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0635300100:9"/>
been ſo long ago, ſince we had ſuch a War,
our People are a little too apt to forget:
But which if they pleaſe to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they will find, will more nearly
touch them, than perhaps they are aware
of, as eſpecially the Price of Coals, touch'd
at before, which will particularly affect the
Inhabitants of this City and County's adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
where Three Pounds and Four Pounds
a Chaldron have been accounted but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Price for Coals, and which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by the direct Situation of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
whoſe Ports immediately opening to
the North Channel, the <hi>Colliers</hi> Ships are
in ten Fold more danger from them, than
they can be from the <hi>French</hi> Privateers, in
Caſe of a War with <hi>France.</hi> It is needleſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
how many other Trades this will affect,
how much dearer it will make all ſuch Goods
as are wrought by Fire, but eſpecially how
ſeverely it will pinch the midling Families
of our Tradeſmen and the Poor, who have
no Relief in Caſe of Cold Weather about
this City, there being no Woods and Forreſts
as in the Country, to ſupply them with
Fewel, and who are put to inexpreſſible
Hardſhips in the Winter for want of Coal.</p>
            <p>The Rates of <hi>Salt,</hi> another Neceſſary of
Life, is a Thing deſerves our Conſideration
in Caſe of Trade; the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
all this Part of <hi>England,</hi> being ſupply'd with
<hi>Salt</hi> from <hi>New Caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> from whence
the Danger being ſo great, the Price of
<hi>Salt</hi> was frequently in the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War,
although no Tax was then upon it, at 4 <hi>d.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0635300100:10"/>
               <hi>per</hi> Pound, and may now poſſibly be double
that Price.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Matters of Trade, and indeed
are but a ſmall part of what might be ſaid
upon that Subject, but however, may ſerve
to ſhew, That a War with <hi>Holland</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happen, without plunging us into many
great Difficulties, ſuch as will juſtify me in

            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>I. It muſt be a War in Defence of Popery.</head>
               <p>I know it has been argued on many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
That this War was not begun on
account of <hi>Religion,</hi> it was the Argument the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Advocates ſtrove to make
uſe of all along, ſubtilly to engage the Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
People the more ſincerely in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and ſtir them up to Blood and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
We find many Inſtances of this, in
the Accounts of the laſt few Years, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> relating to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
was then newly come over to the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
wherein he complains of his Royal
Highneſs joining with <hi>Hereticks</hi> and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God's Church, meaning the <hi>Pruſſian</hi>
and <hi>Saxe-Gotha</hi> Troops, whom he calls Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to GOD and his Church, and which
he ſays they impiouſly brought into <hi>Italy:</hi>
But after all that has been ſaid on that Head,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0635300100:12"/>
tho' we are not now on the Foot of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
War, yet if we fight with the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
we certainly fight againſt the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in Defence of Popery; perhaps it may
not be immediately concern'd, but it is ſo in
its viſible Effects, and no Man can be ſo
blind as not to ſee it. The Powers hereby
protected are all Popiſh; Popiſh, even to
Bigottry, eſpecially the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They
have not only ſtrengthened themſelves
againſt the Proteſtant Religion, but by the
Deſtruction of the Proteſtants themſelves,
and that in the ſevereſt manner.</p>
               <p>Let any Man but take a View of them
ſeparately <hi>in France;</hi> how has the <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
expelled 400000 Proteſtants out of
their Dominions, ſuffering all the Damages,
which the loſs of ſo many Subjects, and their
moveable Eſtates, muſt of neceſſity be to a
Nation, rather than not to root out the
Proteſtant Religion; and indeed they have
rooted it out of moſt part of the Nation,
and one Age of Perſecution more will moſt
effectually do it. How have they ſince pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
the poor Remains of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in the Mountains of the <hi>Cevennes,</hi> and
put all that have fallen into their Hands to
Death, by the cruelleſt Torments imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
How have they lately done the ſame
in the little Principallity of <hi>Orange,</hi> tho' in
all probability they were to reſtore that
Country upon a Peace? In <hi>Spain,</hi> how
have we found the Averſions of the People,
to our great Damage in the War there, while
our Troops have been Maletreated by the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0635300100:13"/>
                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portegueſe,</hi> even while we came
there to aſſiſt them, rejecting their own
Deliverance, <hi>I ſpeak of thoſe well affected to
King</hi> Charles III. only becauſe the Aſſiſtance
brought them was carry'd on by Heretick
Forces, and that the Proteſtants were ſo
odious to them, that they could not bear
to be deliver'd by them. Theſe are the
People we muſt fight for, when ever we
take up Arms againſt the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> for theſe
the Blood of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men and <hi>Britains</hi> is to
be ſpilt, and the Wealth of a Proteſtant
Nation exhauſted, and that not only for
the People of theſe Nations, but for their
very Religion too; could we diſtinguiſh
between the Men and their Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Intereſt of the Nations, and the
Intereſt of their Religion, it were the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be born with: But our Caſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremly
hard, for it is not ſo much the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Intereſt, as the Religious Intereſt that
eventually will be the Concern of the War,
and we fight even for Popery it ſelf:
The Propagation of the Bigottry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
of thoſe Nations being ſo twiſted
with their Power, that the latter never
goes without the former, and they never
did extend their Conqueſt and Dominions
to any Place, where they have not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
their Idolatry and Superſtition, nay,
nor where they have not apply'd themſelves
to expunge and race out the very Name of
the Proteſtant Religion, and the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of the Proteſtant Worſhip. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the Head I am upon, that when ever
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0635300100:14"/>
the unhappy Hour ſhall come, that the
Sword ſhould be drawn in this Quarrel, it
is drawn by the Nature and Conſequence of
the Thing, in Defence of POPERY;
What Proteſtant then can think of this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Horror? How ruinous muſt this be to
the Proteſtant Intereſt! How deſtructive to
the Safety of Religion, to the Freedom of
Conſcience, and to the Proſperity of the
Churches abroad! <hi>Of which by it ſelf;</hi> but
particularly, how dreadful a Work muſt
this be for Proteſtants to do? With what
Face can any Man, who is a Profeſſor of
the Proteſtant Religion, draw his Sword in
ſuch a Quarrel? And which is ſtill worſe,
how can any Proteſtant put his Hand to the
contriving and bringing to paſs ſuch a War.
I have no Hand in, or Eye towards, who is,
or is not concern'd in the Meaſures that have
a Tendency to this; ſome ſay one ſide are
guilty of it, ſome the other, and both
ſeem to agree that it will be a Conſequence
of what is now doing; but I am deſirous
faithfully to repreſent to both Sides, what
the meaning of a War with <hi>Holland</hi> is, what
it implies, and what Effects will neceſſarily
follow, that both Parties may lay their
Hands upon their Hearts, and reflect with
Seriouſneſs what they are about, when they
draw their Swords againſt their Brethren.</p>

            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>II. It muſt be ruinous to the Proteſtant Intereſt.</head>
               <p>This is little more than the Reverſe of the
other as to the part of Religion, becauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0635300100:15"/>
the Defence of Popery muſt be the Ruin, or
at leaſt the Damage of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but I chooſe to call this the <hi>Proteſtant
Intereſt,</hi> becauſe tho' the Religious Intereſt
depends upon it, and muſt follow the Fate
of it upon all Occaſions, yet the Civil and
Politick Intereſt of the Proteſtants, is what
I am now ſpeaking of, and how far the
preſent Caſe will affect it will ſoon appear:
Nothing is more evident, than that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the States General, are the
main Strength of the Proteſtant Intereſt in
the World. The Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> with
the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
it is true, and not at all to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed;
but alas! how long would all theſe,
put together, be able to ſupport the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Cauſe, or to defend themſelves againſt
the Power of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Popery!
How ſoon would the Light of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion in the World be extinguiſhed,
if the Popiſh Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd
againſt thoſe few Northern Provinces!
But the Center of Proteſtant Strength lies
in the joint Forces, Power and Wealth of
the Two Maritime Potentates, <hi>Great Britain</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> their Forces by Land have alone
been able to match the Popiſh Powers of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and to look the King of <hi>France</hi> in the
Face, and their United Force at Sea is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
to be ſuperiour to all the known
World, tho' all their Naval Strength was put
together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0635300100:16"/>
Upon this Strength the Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
ſpeaking of ſecond Cauſes entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
this makes the Proteſtants formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to the World; this alone has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
the Popiſh Powers of the World
from over-running them many Ages ago:
Farther than this, it may not be unneceſſary
to reflect, what Blows the Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
has already received in theſe 20 or 30
Years paſt, how much weaker it is by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
than it was before, and thereby
how unable to reſiſt the Effects of new
Enemies, if join'd together; much
more, how little need there is to have
yet deeper Wounds made in their Intereſt,
than was before: Theſe things are evident
in the following Particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Extirpation of the Proteſtants of
<hi>France.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Succeſſion of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

                  <item>3. The going over of the Elector of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
to the Romiſh Church.</item>
                  <item>4. The weakening and oppreſſing the
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and diveſting the <hi>Swedes</hi>
(who are Guarrantees of the Treaty of
<hi>Weſtphalia</hi>) of their Dominions in the
Empire.</item>
                  <item>5. The Danger of a Popiſh Succeſſor to
the Crowns of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In conſidering theſe Things, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
muſt needs follow to any one, who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0635300100:17"/>
with an impartial Eye, and a juſt Concern
for the Proteſtant Intereſt, can look on the
approaching Danger of a bloody War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Great Britain</hi> and the <hi>States General;</hi>
what a mortal Wound this would be to the
Proteſtant Intereſt, What a Breach it would
make in the Proteſtant Strength, and how
effectually it would expoſe the Proteſtant
Cauſe to be over-run by the Arms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Popiſh Princes, who we have
always found ready to devour them.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe who want Examples to illuſtrate
this, look back upon the Year 1672, when
this Nation gull'd by the Arts and Politicks
of Popiſh Councils, was drawn in to fight
againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> How did it open a way
to all thoſe terrible Conqueſts, which the
<hi>French</hi> King made upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by which
he was within a Trifle of diſſolving their
State, and uniting them all to the Kingdom
of <hi>France,</hi> and by which we had like at that
time to have overwhelm'd the Proteſtant
Religion in the World? And in a Word, by
which this Nation alſo was at laſt brought
to ſuch a Deſperate Point, that had not
the Revolution fallen in to reſcue us from
the Danger, we had fallen into the Ballance
of Power on the Popiſh Side, and had
help'd to outweigh the Proteſtants, to their
univerſal Deſtruction: This may ſerve to
warn us all from falling into the like Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Meaſures, and nothing is more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
than to find our People ſo willing to
run into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0635300100:18"/>
What can our falling upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> at
this time imply? What can the Effect of it
be? Will it not be an immediate weakening
of them in their Defence of the Proteſtant
Religion, and a direct ſtrengthing their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to deſtroy them? And will it not be
an effectual weakening of us alſo, ſo as at
laſt perhaps to render us both too weak to
do that, tho' join'd together, which either
of us are able to do now apart, in Defence
of what is the mutual Intereſt of both?</p>
               <p>Add to this how both Nations are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
exhauſted, and emptied by the long
and continu'd Burthen of this heavy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive
War, that as it has been theſe 22
Years dreining us, it will require twice that
time at leaſt to reſtore and recover us: So
that we are in a much worſe Condition
to waſte one another farther; ſince it
will of courſe ſo entirely expend our Strength
and Capacity for our mutual Defence, that
it muſt render both Sides an eaſie Prey to
the Enemy, as is happily expreſs'd by the
Fable of the two ſmall Birds, who having
been long fighting together, the Eagle
came and ſnatch'd away both.</p>
               <p>Let every conſidering Proteſtant ſummon
his Reaſon, and in the moſt affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
perſuade the Nations, if it be poſſible,
to avoid ſo dangerous a Step as this, which
has a direct Tendency to deſtroy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Intereſt in the World, and which
cuts off the Hands that ſhould defend it; let
them conſider how the Enemies of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
would rejoice; how they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0635300100:19"/>
themſelves from theſe Diviſions and
Diſtractions among Proteſtants, that one
time or other they ſhould break in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the whole Intereſt; let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that the like Strife among Chriſtians,
was the very thing that let <hi>Mahomet</hi> the
Great into <hi>Europe,</hi> and gave leiſure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to the Barbarians, to overthrow
the Remains of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, take
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and plant themſelves and their
<hi>Pagan</hi> Superſtition on the Ruins of the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Chriſtian Churehes: This was the
time the famous City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was
taken, and the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſlain in it,
after a long Siege by the <hi>Turks:</hi> Not one of
the Chriſtian Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> ſending the
leaſt Help, or ſtirring one Foot to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the Chriſtian Emperor, who loſt
his Life in the Storm of the City; not that
the Chriſtian Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> were not
able to have reliev'd the City, and to have
driven the <hi>Turk</hi> out of <hi>Europe,</hi> but they were
univerſally embroil'd in furious Wars againſt
one another, <hi>France</hi> was juſt reſcuing its ſelf
out of the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under the
weak and divided Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 6th; and
<hi>Germany</hi> was embroil'd in Wars between the
Emperor <hi>Fredrick</hi> and the Pope, by which
Means every Hand was employ'd, and that
Power which ſhould have protected the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Intereſt was weaken'd to that Degree,
that the Chriſtians were in no Condition to
oppoſe the victorious <hi>Turks,</hi> but let them
quietly over-run a great part of <hi>Europe.</hi> I
would have all thoſe, who are deſirous of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0635300100:20"/>
engaging theſe two <hi>Proteſtant Nations,</hi> in a
War one with another, read that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Story, and conſider how exactly this
would be the Caſe, between <hi>Papiſts</hi> and
<hi>Proteſtants:</hi> Let them conſider, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Powers of <hi>Europe</hi>
would make on the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſuch a time: Let them examin in
what Poſture we ſhould be to protect the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, in Caſe of any Excurſion
of its <hi>Popiſh</hi> Enemies; how it would leſſen
the Figure the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now make, weaken
their Hands, render them Contemptible to
their Enemies, and lay them open to the
Attempts of thoſe, who have been hitherto
reſtrained only by fear, from devouring
them.</p>
               <p>3. Nor would Victory on either hand
mend it, for the Proteſtant Intereſt being
coucerned, but as one Body in the whole
Quarrel would equally ſuffer, which Side
ſoever obtained the Victory; and this leads
me to the Third Head, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">

               <p>It will be to no purpoſe for any Side to

Strength, one Intereſt, and one Foundation
upon which they ſtand; it is very unhappy
that theſe things cannot pierce a little into
our Thoughts, but that we are all intent at
ſuch a time as this, either on puſhing on a
War, or ſettling a particular Peace, and leaving
the Views and Proſpects of eſtabliſhing <hi>Europe,</hi>
we are turning our Eyes upon a Breach with
our Proteſtant Allies; I do not deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

directing my Speech to both Parties, I would
faithfully repreſent to them, the Ruin and
Diſtreſs that ſuch a War would bring upon
the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in general; how
which Side ſoever get the better, <hi>Popery</hi>
alone gains by the Victory; every Battle
fought weakens the very Conqueror as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi>
as much as it does thoſe that are
beaten: This is what I would move them
to do, that they may if poſſible find out
ſome happy Medium, either on one Side or
other; I do not undertake here to ſay what,
but <hi>I ſay,</hi> ſome happy Medium, to prevent
the giving up the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by the <hi>Popiſh Tyrants</hi> of the World;
that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may not whet their Swords
againſt one another, as they already do
their Tongues in a Dreadful and Implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner; That they would remember
every Drop of Blood they ſhed in this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
leaves them juſt ſo much the leſs to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Power, when that Day
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0635300100:22"/>
ſhall come, <hi>as undoubtedly it will,</hi> when the
Fate of the whole <hi>Proteſtant Interest</hi> may be
try'd by the Sword, and the Forces of all
<hi>Europe</hi> ſhall be divided in a <hi>Religious War;</hi> I
can compare this unhappy Caſe of a War,
between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to nothing ſo
well, as to the War between the Children
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> againſt their Brethren of the Tribe
of <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is remarkable for the fury of it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Tribes Swearing, binding one
another by an Oath, or a great Oath as the
Text hath it, That every Man that came
not up to the Lord at <hi>Mizpeth,</hi> that is, to
fight againſt <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſhould be put to
Death; and another Oath they had alſo
made, <hi>viz.</hi> That they would not any of
them give their Daughters to a <hi>Benjamite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Story is too well known to repeat
the Particulars, the War was carry'd on with
great Fury, and was very bloody, as ſuch
Wars always are; it was ſo bloody that
they ſpared neither Age, Sex or Condition,
no, nor the very Cattle; but burnt down
all their Cities, and all that came to hand,
<hi>Judg.</hi> 20. 48. So that the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi>
was entirely cut off, only Six Hundred Men
being left alive of the whole Race: And
what Joy had <hi>Iſrael</hi> of this Victory! they had
no ſooner done it, but ſee the Title or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the next Chapter. <hi>The People bewail

ſaid, There is one tribe cut off from Iſrael this
Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See here the mournful Satisfaction of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over our Friends! what is the Engliſh
of it but this, <hi>There is one Tribe cut off from Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi>
That is, ſhould <hi>we now</hi> be invaded by the
<hi>Heathen,</hi> by the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> or
the <hi>Midianites,</hi> or any of the Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
there is one Tribe leſs, to help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Borders of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Our Brethren of
<hi>Benjamin</hi> are cut off, and we are left naked
on that Side, we are juſt ſo much the weaker
by our Victory.</p>
               <p>How exactly does this anſwer to the
Caſe before us? Should either Side prevail,
ſhould we beat, ſhould we conquer the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
ſhould the Heathen (<hi>French</hi>) fall in upon
them, and over-run them entirely, <hi>as in</hi> 1672
<hi>they had almoſt done, by our infatuated Aſſiſtance,</hi>
what would be our Joy in this Conqueſts?
Should we not reflect on our ſelves after it,
and <hi>repent our ſelves for Benjamin?</hi> Should we
not ſay, <hi>why is this come to paſs among</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
<hi>that a Tribe or Nation of</hi> Proteſtants <hi>is</hi>

                  <hi>now lacking in Iſrael?</hi> Should we not lament
for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that a Tribe was cut off from
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Strength?</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, ſhould this War fall
heavy on Us, and though Ruin is what we
pretend not to fear, yet might it not ſo
weaken us, as to expoſe us an eaſy Prey to
the <hi>Pretender</hi> and his Party, which would
be the worſt ſort of Ruin; would not the
<hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves, and the whole Body of
the Proteſtants of <hi>Europe, Bewail the Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Benjamin,</hi> and repent them for having
loſt a Tribe from the <hi>Proteſtant Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let all thoſe, as well of one Side or other,
who are either haſty for, or indifferent in
the Caſe of a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> look into
theſe Things, and conſider ſeriouſly what
they are doing; conſider the Conſequence
of a War, in which, whether conquering
or conquered, the Intereſt of the Proteſtant
Religion ſuffers, and the Strength of the
Proteſtant Powers is weakned, and we ſhall
all have Cauſe to bewail the Deſolation of
our Brethren.</p>

                  <hi>are very ſubtle and many,</hi> to make this

examine the Conſequences of a War, with
the Guarrantees of that Succeſſion, and what
will he infer, but that however intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

it ſelf; not that I enter here into the
Caſe, whether the Guarrantee of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
were neceſſary, as was thought by way of
Treaty: Let that be as it will, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That the <hi>Dutch</hi> as a Proteſtant State,
Ally'd in Intereſt to both, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Houſe
of <hi>Hannover</hi> and to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and
their own Safety, abſolutely requiring, that
this Nation ſhould never come into <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Hands, are an undoubted Natural Security
to the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and unleſs their
Power be broken by ſuch a War as this,
muſt be ſuppoſed always to be ready by a
natural Conſequence, to aſſiſt and ſupport
the ſaid Succeſſion, and all the Friends of
it, with all their Might; they can do no other,
if they are not like us infatuated and blind
to their own Safety and Intereſt; nor is this
the leaſt part of our Security againſt the
<hi>Pretender,</hi> and all the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Enemies of the

of them who are Abroad.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then who propagate, whether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
or clandeſtinely, a Breach between
the Two Nations, are ſo far real Enemies to
the <hi>Hannover</hi> Succeſſion, let their Views and
Deſigns, Meaſures or Pretences be what
they will, ſuch, while they cry out Zealouſly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0635300100:26"/>
for the Proteſtant Succeſſion, would do well
to tell Us, how ſhall the Elector of <hi>Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
ſupport his Right? How ſhall he come
over hither with Forces and Armies in caſe
of a contending <hi>Pretender,</hi> who may be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately

ſhall he recover the Poſſeſſion, or come to

Faction; if the <hi>Dutch</hi> are ruin'd, and their

               <p>A War with <hi>Holland,</hi> would in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects

me, That there is indeed <hi>no other real Danger</hi>
of the <hi>Hannover</hi> Succeſſion, but the ruining
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for that whatever the Artifice of
Parties may bring to paſs, and however the
<hi>High flying</hi> and <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party in League
with <hi>France,</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Powers, may
form a Conjunction of Intereſt, ſo as to erect
the Pretender; nay, tho' they were to ſet
him upon the Throne, yet that there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be ſuch a Body, of the beſt, the wiſeſt,
and the moſt conſiderable People of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſteady to the Intereſt of the Houſe of
<hi>Hannover,</hi> and firm to the Solemn Abjuration
they have made of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> that on
the firſt appearance of the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
with any reaſonable Force to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0635300100:27"/>
the Nation to the Right Eſtabliſh'd Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
in ſpight of all the Oppoſition, that the
Enemies of the Proteſtant Intereſt could
make: But if the <hi>Dutch</hi> before this ſhould
be oppreſſed by a War, and their Naval
Strength and Power broken by us, in vain
we may ſtretch out our Hands to the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
for help, who cannot without a Fleet
yield us that Aſſiſtance, or do himſelf that
Juſtice, which otherwiſe he is very well able
to do, ſo that fighting againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> is
cutting off the Right-hand of the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
On the other hand, ſhould the Forces
of <hi>Britain</hi> be broken or weaken'd in this

<hi>Pretender,</hi> whether he comes back't by a <hi>French</hi>
or a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power, or depending upon the
Intereſt of his <hi>Jacobite</hi> Friends and Faction
at Home; a Nation exhauſted, impoveriſh'd,
and tyr'd out with War, cannot be in ſo good
a Condition to reſiſt an Invader, nor ſo
warmly inclin'd to engage in a new War,
againſt Tyranny and Oppreſſion, as while
we are whole and in Condition; ſo that
which way ſoever we take this War, and
which way ſoever the Succeſs of a <hi>Dutch</hi>
War ſhall fall, it will be Dangerous if not
Fatal to the Proteſtant Succeſſion of the

            <div n="5" type="section">

This, beſides what relates as before to
the Proteſtant Intereſt, and the <hi>Hannover</hi>
Succeſſion, will be conſider'd, as it reſpects
our Commerce, our publick Credit, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
Circumſtances, and our general Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Intereſt; what relates to Commerce, has
been touch'd at already, and I may only
add this, that as our Trade in general
is already prodigiouſly ſunk, by the long
Interruption of 22 Years War; the Damage
of which will not in ſome Ages, <hi>if Ever,</hi> be
wholly repair'd; So a War with <hi>Holland</hi> at
this time, would give ſuch a Blow to that
Part which remains, that in general our
whole Trade would be overwhelmed in Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and Confuſions inextricable; the
Employment of the Poor, by the Stop and
Interruption of Commerce in the preſent
Wars, has in ſeveral Parts of <hi>England</hi> been
quite ſtopt, in others they are taken off of the
Manufactures they were originally bred to. So
that whole Towns remain now Deſtitute of
ſo much as the appearance of thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
they were formerly wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with; our Colonies Abroad, by the
ſtop of the Conſumption and Exportation of
their Produce, occaſion'd by the War, are
oblig'd to leave Planting, as in <hi>Virginia</hi> in
particular, and apply themſelves to Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
by which in a few Years the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Woollen Manufactures, which uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was ſent from hence, will be effectually
ſtopp'd. All theſe and many more will be
encreaſed by a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to whom,
including <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> at this time, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0635300100:29"/>
more of our Woolen, Manufactures than
to all Parts of the World beſides, tho' put
together.</p>
               <p>What then ſhall be the Condition of our
People, when as before the Export of our
Broad Cloth, Kerſies, Serges and Stuffs, of
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> now receive ſuch great
Quantities ſhall be ſtop'd, and when the
poor People, who now live upon thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
ſhall be deſtitute of Work, and
be left to ſeek their Bread? Let thoſe
People that think a War with <hi>Holland</hi> of no
Conſequence, conſider of ſome Equivalent
for this, and of opening ſome Trade for
the vent of our Manufactures, which ſhall
ſufficiently ſupply the Poor with Labour,
and raiſe Money effectually to pay them.</p>
               <p>If theſe Things were conſider'd, we ſhould
be more cautious, as well of coveting to
make a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as of pleaſing
our ſelves with the Hopes that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
will force us to it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not touch at the Conſequences,
which ſome have already ſpoken to, in caſe
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> puſhing on the
War without Us, ſhould reduce <hi>France,</hi> and
and recover <hi>Spain,</hi> not only without any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
from Us, but even againſt our Will,
the many ways this may be fatal to Us, are
better thought of in private, than made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and it is hoped the Prudence of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
may avoid puſhing us to thoſe Extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
But I cannot omit mentioning again,
tho' ſpoken to before, how evidently ſuch a
War would open a Door to <hi>the Pretender,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0635300100:30"/>
expoſe theſe Nations, as a Prey to the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi>
Intereſt, as well at Home as Abroad; for
as ſome Men hope, ſo I cannot but ſee, that
in caſe of a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of the <hi>Jacobite Party</hi> will be inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
nor can they be ſo blind to their own
Intereſt, as not to know it; and this is the
true Reaſon, that you cannot converſe at
this Time with a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> but you diſcover
his moſt Paſſionate Deſire of a War with the
<hi>Dutch;</hi> all their Emiſſaries are buſie, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Exaſperating
our People againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and if the <hi>States-General</hi>
do ſtand out againſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
or take any Step that ſeems a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging,
theſe Men, far from doing Juſtice
on either Hand, ſet all their Emiſſaries at
Work, to aggravate it, and make it appear
worſe than really it is: On the other Hand,
the ſame Party in <hi>Holland</hi> act the very other
Extreme, and there they exclaim againſt the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Meaſures, tell the <hi>Dutch</hi> they are Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament has uſed
them barbarouſly; That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Miniſtry
impoſe upon them, and cram the Peace down
their Throats, and the like: The Reaſon is
evident, they ſeek nothing but a Breach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſee clearly that a War is the only
Step that can make way for their Intereſt,
and open a Door to the Pretender.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>VI. It muſt be a War againſt the General Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0635300100:31"/>
This ſeems to want no Proof, even the
Queen herſelf and the Miniſtry, however it
may ſeem, are averſe to it, and the Meaſures ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> however Calculated to
carry on the Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> have
plainly diſcover'd, that it is not the Inclination
of the Miniſtry to break with the <hi>Dutch</hi> if
they can avoid it; they cannot but ſee, that
it will be <hi>Ruinous to our Trade,</hi> and that the
<hi>Burthens</hi> muſt be intollerable that muſt follow,
eſpecially our preſent Impoveriſh'd Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
conſider'd: Nor can it be Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the Miniſtry, who give the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
Condition of the Nation, as the beſt
and firſt Reaſon for making a Peace with
<hi>France,</hi> ſhould at the ſame Time be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of that exhauſted Condition of the
Nation, as to lead them into a War with
<hi>Holland;</hi> this would be to deny what they
had alledg'd before, and Contradict what
was the main Argument given, for Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
us of the Neceſſity of former Meaſures,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Nation was Reduced, Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
Impoveriſh'd, and the like, and that
ſome Ages were requir'd to reſtore our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and this was acknowledg'd in
many Caſes to be true; but the People
will, of courſe think themſelves banter'd and
jeſted with in all that, if we think fit now
to run into another War, which may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way as fatal and as chargeable as the
other.</p>
               <p>As to the Inclination of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that has many Ways been try'd, the
Averſions that formerly were in our People
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0635300100:32"/>
againſt a <hi>Dutch</hi> War, were too well known
to thoſe who obſerv'd it, <hi>viz.</hi> with what
Backwardneſs they Engag'd! with what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance
they Liſted! how the poor Seamen
were dragg'd into the Service, like a Bear
to the Stake! It would be too long to enter
upon the Reaſons and Conſiderations which
moved this Averſion, the Thing ſpeaks itſelf;
they have been long our Friends and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
have often Aſſiſted, Relieved, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
Us in our Embroiled Circumſtances,
and we cannot without Reluctance, deſire
to fight againſt a People whom we have ſo
often acted in Conjunction with: We have
look'd upon them as our Friends, as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in the late War, and it muſt be with
Regret, that our People ſhould rejoyce in
contrary Extremes, and ſheath their Swords
in the Bowels of thoſe, who they ſhook
Hands with before.</p>
               <p>Trade, our mutual Converſe in Buſineſs,
and the long Interwoven Intereſts of the
two Nations, cannot but Contribute to this
Inclination; and the Damage we ſhall feel,
and that immediately too, will aſſiſt to form
the Averſions which are in our Minds againſt
the War, and make our People abhorr the
Thoughts of it; but I need not inſiſt upon
this, which every Man knows to be Fact,
and can trace the Original of; I come now
to conſider the two laſt Articles, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0635300100:33"/>
               <head>VII. That it will be a War, in which we are
very likely to have the Diſadvantage.</head>
               <p>Not that I am of the Opinion that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> will beat Us, as ſome People talk, and
yet farther from pleaſing myſelf with the
Hopes of it, as ſome pretend we do; but if,
as before, we ſhall be Loſers, even by the
Succeſs we may pretend to have in it, what
then muſt be the want of that Succeſs, if ſuch
a Caſe alſo ſhould happen? Let thoſe who
calmly Examin Things at all, look back on
the Stop of Trade, Loſs of Shipping, Ruin
of Merchants, want of Employ for our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
mention'd before in this Tract, and judge
for themſelves, as to the Advantages to Us;
but if we ſhould have the worſt of it at Sea
alſo, as no Man can Anſwer for the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Events of War; if our Navy ſhould be
Defeated, our Ships, which are our Strength,
receive any fatal Blow, which we are not
ſure of the Diſadvantages which will follow
to us, are ſuch, as I ſhall, in hopes they will
never happen, conceal for the preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> No more ſhall I think to terrifie any
from a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by telling them
it will not be a War to be Trifled with; that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> when they uſed to meet
at Sea, do not uſe to make a Jeſt of it; fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> has always had a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in it from fighting with other Nations:
Theſe fight at a diſtance, and lie and pelt one
another, while they are a quarter of a Mile
or half a Mile off, or pour in their ſmall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0635300100:34"/>
Shot upon one another, to pick off their
Men; but when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
uſed to meet, three Sea fights have been
fought with near 80 Sail of a ſide in one
Summer, the great 3 Deck Ships of 100 Guns
each, ſink and burn by one another's Side,
and the Squadrons lie Yard-Arm and Yard-Arm,
pouring in their Croſs-Bar, Double
Head and Round, and tearing one another
with that dreadful Fury, that nothing on
Earth can be ſpoken of, to deſcribe thoſe
Sea fights by; let thoſe who remember the
laſt <hi>Holland</hi> Wars, tell us, whether the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Action we have had at Sea during this
War, can be compar'd to the Way of fighting
between Us and the <hi>Dutch?</hi> And there is no
Queſtion to be made but the like muſt follow
again, if a New War begin; This ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Animoſity between the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is like to be as great as ever, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
greater; and the War, if ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Event ſhould follow, will be Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the greateſt Fury that any War e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was between Us.</p>
               <p>Having thus laid down the Conſequences
of ſuch a War, it cannot be thought that
any one in theſe Nations, who is a Friend
to the Proteſtant Succeſſion, to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, to the general Intereſt of
the Proteſtant Powers, to Trade, to the Poor,
or indeed to themſelves, can deſire to have
theſe two Proteſtant Nations engag'd with
one another, eſpecially at ſuch a Time as
this. It is an invidious Task to go about here
to make Enquiry who are, or are not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of this War? Or who among us may,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0635300100:35"/>
by puſhing on their ſeparate Schemes, bring
it to paſs by the Conſequence of theſe
Schemes, whether involuntarily or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
it is too evident where this lies, to
need an Enquiry, but as I have made this
Piece hitherto independent, and look nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, as to Parties, ſo it ſeems not at
all needful: The Advice is to both, or all
our Parties, that they would conſider very
well what they are doing, what Intereſt
they are carrying on; whoſe alone will be
the Advantage; to whom will be the Joy
of ſuch a War: For if theſe are our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and if all theſe Diſadvantages threaten
us by a War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it cannot be,
but that a Proportion of Gain and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
will accrue to the Enemy, for what is
our Loſs, muſt on the other Hand be their
Advantage.</p>
               <p>I know, and eaſily foreſee many Things
will be objected here, and it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſpeak to them all in their Order,
tho' our Space at the end of this Work is
too ſhort, to ſay all that might be ſpoken—The
Objections are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Tho'
it be true, that the Conſequences of a War
with <hi>Holland,</hi> are, as you have ſaid, yet
what muſt be done? We are not to let the
<hi>Dutch</hi> inſult us, becauſe it is our Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
ſo many ways to have War. That if
the <hi>Dutch</hi> reject the Meaſures propoſed for
their Advantage, and Ours too, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Things on to an extravagant Height,
THEY force the War and not WE: That
by doing what is incompatible with our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0635300100:36"/>
Intereſt, they in Effect declare the War; ſo
that it is They make War with the QUEEN,
not the QUEEN with Them: That the
<hi>Dutch</hi> are acted by a Faction from hence,
who prompt and perſuade them to ſtand
out, and put them in hopes, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, may bring Things to a new Turn
here, and put a new Face upon our Affairs,
and that all theſe Things puſh the preſent
Miniſtry upon the neceſſity of taking the
Meaſures they now purſue, to preſerve the
preſent Government; and if the <hi>Dutch</hi> join
with a Party here, who oppoſe Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
juſt Meaſures, they bring the War
upon themſelves, and that Party here are the
Cauſe, and ought to bear the Blame of the
War, and of all the Inconveniences and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
that may follow.</p>
               <p>It is not my Work here to argue for or
againſt the Parties, as I ſaid before, I am
rather for giving all the Latitude to the
Objectors on either Hand, and therefore I
willingly, for Arguments-ſake, allow all
the Objection; but without entring into the
Merit of the Caſe on the one Side, or the
Other, the Conſequences of the War, not
the Neceſſity of it, is the preſent Argument
before us.</p>
               <p>If there is a neceſſity for a War with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> I am ſorry for that unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
but without entring into a Diſpute of
the Fact, my Draught of the Conſequences
lies as a Caution to all Parties to conſider,
with the utmoſt Seriouſneſs, what that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
is, and if poſſible to remove thoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0635300100:37"/>
Cauſes, which bring that Neceſſity on; for
if the Effects of a <hi>Dutch</hi> War are as before, we
ought to be very well ſatisfy'd, that our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for it are of ſufficient Weight to ballance
all the Evils that follow; and if on a due
Enquiry it ſhould be found that theſe Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
are of our own making, and that we
maliciouſly on both Sides puſh one another
on to the Extremities, which in their own
nature procure this Miſchief. The Excuſe
of its being neceſſary will dwindle away
into, and plainly diſcover, a wicked Plot to
bring this War upon the Nation, even
for the ſake of thoſe very Miſchiefs that
ſo neceſſarily attend it.</p>
               <p>As to letting the <hi>Dutch</hi> inſult us, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Cauſe of the War wholly upon
them; if this were true, or ſhould appear,
all that has been ſaid will lye againſt the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and not againſt Us, and were I to
write this in <hi>Holland,</hi> I would perhaps be
able to ſhew the <hi>Dutch,</hi> how many ways a
War with <hi>Britain</hi> may be fatal and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to them, as well as to us Us: Many of
the Arguments before-mention'd, hold good
on their Side, as well as Ours. The <hi>Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
Succeſſion is, tho' ſomething more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely,
as much their Concern as Ours;
the Proteſtant Intereſt ought to lie as near
their Hearts as ours. The Interruptions of
Commerce, the Loſs of Ships, Trade and
Goods; Theſe are Things they will bear
their ſhare of, no Queſtion with us: If
they gain by the War; if they Beat us,
they will have as much Cauſe to mourn for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0635300100:38"/>
their Victory as We for our Loſs; and as
the Author of the <hi>Review</hi> ſays very well,
<q rend="inline">"The whole War is but the ſame thing
as a Man cutting off his Left Hand with
his Right."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Advice is to them therefore, <hi>equally
as to us,</hi> tho' not quite with the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
they ought to ſtudy all the Methods
poſſible to avoid this Breach; they ought to
conſider and duly weigh the General Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Intereſt, and rather abate in ſome of their
Demands for Peace-ſake, and to avoid the
threatning Danger: In ſhort, both Nations,
and every Party or Faction in both Nations,
ought to conſider well what they are doing,
and to what a deſperate Condition the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Intereſt will be reduced, and nothing
but ſuch unavoidable neceſſity as will juſtify
them before God and Man, ought to be
allow'd as a Reaſon for this War.</p>
               <p>I might deſcend here to other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but as they ſeem to lead more directly
into our preſent Party Diſputes, which
in this Tract, I purpoſe not to meddle
with, I omit them, and chooſe to let this
Animadverſion reſpect every Side, that
if poſſible it may be uſeful to them all; and
may bring all Parties ſeriouſly to apply
themſelves, if poſſible, to heal this Breach
now while it is young, and before the
Wound feſters, before it comes up to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation
and Mortification, when all the
Endeavours will but encreaſe the Miſery,
and be ineffectual to the Cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0635300100:39"/>
It is our preſent Misfortune, that our
People on both Sides ſeem not to ſee into
the Miſchiefs of the preſent Caſe, the
Willingneſs on one Hand, and the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs
at the Conſequences on the other,
which unhappily appear among our People
with reſpect to a War with <hi>Holland</hi> are very
ſurprizing, and it ſeems to me to ſignify, that
neither of the Parties have duly weigh'd the
thing: Theſe Sheets are written, that they
may not want a Light to ſee by in this Caſe,
nor plead Ignorance of the Effects, when
they may have brought them upon us too
late.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe who profeſs it their Deſign to
overthrow the preſent Settlement of this
Nation, I mean the Enemies of the <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the Friends of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny;</hi> theſe Sheets are
not written for their Conviction, I do not
ſo much reproach them with deſiring a
War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> becauſe it ſeems the
only way to bring all their Deſires to paſs.</p>
               <p>But this may be drawn from thence as a
moſt direct Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Popular Cry againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> is a ſad
Token of the Growth and Encreaſe of
<hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> among Us, and of the growing
Intereſt of the <hi>Pretender.</hi>
