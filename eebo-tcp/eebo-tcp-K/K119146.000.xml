            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THOUGH the Character of Mr. <hi>Shenſtone,</hi> is too well
known, and his reputation as a Writer too firmly eſtabliſhed, to require
any further commendation, yet it may perhaps be expected that ſome apology
ſhould be made for this volume of his Works, containing Familiar Letters to
ſome of his moſt intimate Friends.</p>
            <p>To theſe who may think ſuch an apology re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, it might
be ſufficient to ſay, that the reception which the former volumes have met
with, affords the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe that an addition to them
would be very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Public; and that the author's talent in
<hi>epiſtolary</hi> writing appears not to have been inferior to that which
diſtinguiſhes his other compoſitions.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that, whatever their merit may be,
<hi>Letters,</hi> not intended for the Public, ought not to be publiſhed, and
that an act of this kind is a violation of private friendſhip.</p>
            <p>This objection, it muſt be confeſſed, carries with it ſuch
an air of delicacy, that the perſons here concerned are very willing to give
it all due attention. At the ſame time they cannot but obſerve, that it
will not hold in all caſes, and therefore muſt unavoidably be ſubject to
ſome limitations—that theſe limitations muſt <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1250901200:3"/>
vary, as the circumſtances of caſes happen to vary—and that not to
make proper allowances for ſuch circumſtances is highly
unreaſonable—injurious to many who have deſerved well of the Public
by this very conduct, and detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the intereſts of Literature. It
might perhaps be difficult, and is by no means neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to enumerate
theſe ſeveral limitations. It will be ſufficient in this place to ſay,
that where neither the reputation of the Writer, nor that of any other
perſon, is injured, there the force of the objection evidently ceaſes. And
it is not only believed, on the moſt mature deliberation, that this is the
caſe in the preſent inſtance; but moreover that the there are poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
good reaſons in its favour, reſpecting as well the Writer's character in
this <hi>ſpecies</hi> of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as the ſatisfaction and
entertainment of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The encouragement which has been uſually given to Works of this
nature might ſeem to make theſe obſervations unneceſſary! But it was
not thought ſufficient barely to ſhelter this publication under the
ſanction of ſuch an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; as it is well known that the wantonneſs
of curioſity has ſometimes encouraged deſign by no means
juſtifiable:—and it is as readily acknowledged that the following
Letters are deficient in many particulars requiſite to excite that
curioſity, being neither written on popular ſubjects, nor addreſſed to
perſons of rank and eminence in the world. They will not fail how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to
afford an agreeable entertainment to ſuch as can reliſh an animated
diſplay of the various efforts of a fine imagination for a length of years,
whether amuſing itſelf with <pb n="v" facs="tcp:1250901200:4"/> rural embelliſhments, or
occupied in other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of learned retirement, and a warm
diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted friendſhip. Such are the ſubjects of the following
Letters! and if any perſon ſhould ſtill retain a doubt concerning the
propriety of perpetuating them in this manner, he ſhall be finally referred
to the writer's own authority, who, in a letter dated October, 23, 1754, thus
expreſſes himſelf:</p>
            <q>I confeſs to you that I am conſiderably mortified by Mr.
W—'s conduct in regard to thoſe Letters (meaning his own letters to
that gentleman's brother;) and, rather than they ſhould have been ſo
unneceſſarily deſtroyed, would have given more money than it is
allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to mention with decency. I look upon my letters as ſome of
my <hi>chef-d'aeuvres</hi>; and could I be ſuppoſed to have the
ſmalleſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to propriety of ſtyle or ſentiment, I ſhould
imagine it muſt appear principally in my Letters to his brother, and one or
two more friends. I conſider them as the records of a friendſhip that will
be alway dear to me, and as the hiſtory of my mind for theſe twenty years
paſt.</q>
            <p>When it is conſidered how ſeldom ſo valuable a collection of
real correſpondence is to be met with, and how difficult it is to ſupply
the want of it by a fictitious one, it cannot be doubted that the Public will
be pleaſed to ſee the loſs here complained of ſo well repaired, and to
be furniſhed with ſuch genuine examples of the Author's ſtyle and
ſentiments, together with an authentic hiſtory of his mind, for ſo long a
ſpace of time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1250901200:5"/>To conclude: The talents of this Author, on
whatever ſubject they were exerciſed, were ſo uncommon, and the fame of
his little <hi>Ferme ornée,</hi> under the conduct of a taſte entirely
original, was become ſo conſiderable, that every ſpecimen of the one, and
every anecdote relative to the improvement of the other, ſeemed too
intereſting to be buried in oblivion: at leaſt, they were thought ſo by
thoſe to whom the <hi>greater</hi> part of this Collection is
addreſſed:—perſons indeed confeſſedly partial to the Writer's
talents, and intereſted in his commendations; but at the ſame time
perſons neither ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of their Friend's reputation, nor their
own, as to have hazarded either, without the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſuaſion that
their partiality had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon their judgement; and that it was no
indecent oſtentation in them, by this public act, to teſtify, that they
eſteemed it not only a peculiar felicity in their fortunes, but likewiſe
ſome degree of credit, to have enjoyed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſuch a
friendſhip throughout ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a period of human life.</p>

            <p>AS my head is conſiderably more confuſed than uſual, by

<hi>recitative,</hi> reſerving all my <hi>airs</hi> for a ſeaſon when my
mind is more in <hi>tune.</hi> Such, I hope, will be the time which you ſet
apart to attend the <hi>chief muſician,</hi> at Birmingham. I thoroughly

ſee any joke that it containeth, the forementioned gentleman may be aſked
to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it into muſic. When I uſe this expreſſion, you will,
peradventure, look upon it as my opinion, that in muſical compoſitions,
ſound ought as much to anſwer ſenſe as one language does another,
inſomuch, that ſuch and ſuch thoughts ought to bring into our heads
ſuch and ſuch ſounds, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> But in caſe there is

            <p>WELL! and ſo I ſate me down in my <hi>room,</hi> and was reading
<hi>Pamela</hi>—one might furniſh this book with ſeveral pretty
decorations, thought I to myſelf; and then I began to deſign cuts for it,
in particular places. For inſtance, one, where Pamela is forced to fall upon
her knees in the arbor: a ſecond, where ſhe is in bed, and Mrs. Jewkes
holds one hand, and Mr. B. the other: a third, where Pamela ſits ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in
the ſummer-houſe, &amp;c. So I juſt ſketched them out, and ſent my
little hints, ſuch as they were, to Mr. R—n. As ſoon as I had
ſealed my letter, in comes Mrs. Arnold<note n="*" place="bottom">His
houſe-keeper, of whom very reſpectful mention is made in the courſe of
this correſpondence.</note>—
<q rend="inline">"Well, Mrs. Arnold," ſays I, "this Mr. Jago never
comes—what can one do? I'm as dull as a beetle for want of company."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Sir," ſays ſhe, "the hen"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"What makes you out of breath," <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1250901200:15"/>
ſays I, "Mrs. Arnold, what's the matter?"—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir," ſays ſhe, "the hen I ſet laſt
ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day-was-three-weeks has juſt hatched, and has brought out all her

               <q rend="inline">"That's brave indeed," ſays I.</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, that it is," ſays ſhe, "ſo be and't

               <q rend="inline">"No, thank ye, Mrs. Arnold," ſays I; "but aren't

               <q rend="inline">"No, Sir," ſays ſhe; "I hope there's no danger;
I <hi>takes</hi> pretty good care of 'em."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"I don't queſtion your care," ſays I; "for
you're ſeldom without a duck or a chicken about you."—</q>
               <q rend="inline">"Poor pretty <hi>creters,</hi>" ſays ſhe; "look

               <q rend="inline">"Ay, I thought you wern't without one about you,"
ſays I: "I don't think," ſays I, "Mrs. Arnold, but your ſoul was

               <q rend="inline"> "Why, and if I <hi>had</hi> been a hen," ſays
ſhe, "I believe I ſhould have done as much for my chickens as yonder great

ſhe.</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Ay, that you would," thought I. "Well, but now when

               <q rend="inline">"Well," ſays I, "Mrs. Arnold, you and your chicken

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I CANNOT avoid imagining the firſt part of your letter was mere
raillery. I am ſure it gave me a good deal of pleaſure (for I can bear very
well to hear my foibles expoſed, though not my faults) and on that account
muſt needs make grateful mention of it. I acknowledge the oddneſs of the
letter which occaſioned it, and could not expect that ſuch an ill-formed
appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation could have produced an anſwer ſo very oratorical. In the
firſt place, you lay open the ſubject, or indeed, what you call the offices
in which I am pleaſed to employ you. In the next, you alledge your own
inability to enter upon matters of ſuch great concernment. That this is
rhetorical, nay, pure rhetoric, I gather from the exordiums of all the
declamations that I ever heard in my life. 'Tis, moreover, not uncommon with
declaimers to give ſome reaſons why they ſhould not abſolutely decline
the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though they are ſenſible of their inſufficiency
(otherwiſe they might be expected to ſit down, and hold their tongues.) And
this is what you have done, by ſaying that you are unwilling to diſſent
from the world in regard to the ſubjects you are engaged in. That you,
therefore, choſe to ſteer a middle courſe, by that means avoiding the
imputation of preſumption on the one hand, and indifference on the other.
When this is done, you enter gravely upon the ſubject, and, to give it a
greater perſpicuity, divide it into two parts. The firſt part happens to be

<q rend="inline">"concerning the purchaſe of <hi>an</hi>
horſe."</q> On this occaſion, you inform me, that I am in a good country
for horſes; and, ſecondly, that I have a number of <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1250901200:17"/>
acquaintance round about me, who are very well ſkilled in the nature of them.
Now each of theſe informations ſeems, at firſt ſight, to mean no more
than what I have better opportunities of knowing than the perſon who informs
me, and, on this account, to err in point of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity. But, upon ſecond
thoughts, they have <hi>this force</hi> (to ſpeak like a grammarian) namely,
that I am entirely negligent of my own affairs; and, ſecondly, that I care
not whom I give trouble to, if I can but avoid it myſelf; ſo that the
ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have really a beauty, when one ſearches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their
ſuperficies. After you have ſaid this and more, which includes all that can
be ſaid upon the ſubject, you deſcend to the ſecond diviſion, in
relation to which I am too grateful to be otherwiſe than <hi>ſeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> in my acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>I had not expatiated thus far but to ſhew that I am not
inſenſible of a ſneer; nor ſhould I expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate any farther, but to
prove, that I am equally ſenſible of a favour.</p>
            <p>I deſire you would believe, that I abſolutely aſſent to your
critique. That ſome of your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were my own before I communicated
the verſes; and others, as ſoon as you had favoured me with the diſcovery
of them. That I would, <hi>per praeſentes,</hi> return my thanks for them;
which you might juſtly have claimed, whether I had approved them or not. One
exception to this approbation my modeſty bids me mention, on account of your
too great partiality in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. My gratitude you are entitled to, without
exception or limitation.</p>
            <p>It will, perhaps, gratify your curioſity to know, that Mr. G. has
a copy of verſes in the laſt magazine, entitled, 
<q rend="inline">"The little Cur."</q> There are ſeveral ſtrokes
that are pictureſque and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous; I believe it was done in haſte. The
motto is exquiſite, and much more properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Mr. G. than the
Emperor Adrian, in <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1250901200:18"/> my opinion, notwithſtanding all that
Pope ſays. Tell me your judgment of Mr. L—n's in the ſame paper. The
epigram 
<q rend="inline">"To one who refuſed to walk in the Park,
&amp;c."</q> is a good one.</p>
            <p>I have waved ſending the verſes to Mr. Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile at preſent,
becauſe I hope to ſee you ſoon either at the Leaſows or at Birmingham.
I can't tell whether I ſhall have time to incloſe in this letter my ballad.

caſtle, wherein ſhe was a priſoner, and ſeeing a country milk-maid
ſinging, expreſſed great envy at the girl's condition, and
diſſatisfaction with regard to her own.</note>. It is as much deſigned
for my own ſinging (in private I mean) as ever was a bottle of cherry-brandy
for an old woman's drinking. Now I think of it, I really believe that I every
day approach nearer and nearer to the capacity, the way, the inſignificancy,
of an old woman. Mrs. Arnold has certainly, by her <hi>charms,</hi> her
incantations, and her converſations together, contributed a good deal to this
transformation. Pray come over if you can, and try to reinſtate me in my

            <p>I RETURN you my thanks, moſt heartily, for the poetical
reſentment which you have ſhewn againſt my cenſurers, the
Riddle-maſters. I have ſent Mr. Somervile's verſes and yours to Cave;
though I am aſhamed to own I neglected it ſo long, that, I fear, he will
have no room for them this month. If you can extirpate falſe wit in a manner,
you will do no ſmall ſervice to the true: you do no ſmall <hi>honour</hi>
to it, whether you extirpate the other or not.</p>
            <p>You have heard of the motion; have heard, probably, all that I can
tell you of it. That it was ill-concerted; that it has done the oppoſition
great diſſervice; that the King is now confirmed in the opinion of Sir
Robert's honeſty; that the younger Mr. Pitt's ſpeech was the moſt admired
on the oppoſite ſide, and Sir R—t's on the court ſide; that they
did not leave the Houſe till five in the morning; that Sir R—t and
P—y are ſo violent, that the Sp—r is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually calling them to
order; finally, that the affair has occaſioned this print, which I addreſs
to your curioſity merely, though the lines upon the Biſhop are humourous
enough.—Now I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion curioſity; do you take notice of the many quaint
contrivances made uſe of to catch people's n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<q rend="inline">"Are theſe things ſo?"—"Yes, they
are."—"What then!"—"The devil of a ſtory."—"Hoy,
boys."—"Up go we."—</q>And a thouſand others. What do you think
muſt be my expence, who love to pry into every thing of this kind? Why,
truly, one ſhilling. My company goes to George's Coffee-houſe, where, for
that ſmall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, I read all pamphlets under a three-ſhilling 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1250901200:20"/> dimenſions; and, indeed, any larger ones would not be fit
for coffee-houſe peruſal.—Lord Dudley lent me two ſermons, given
him at the Houſe of Lords, which I read laſt night. In the firſt, there
are a great many deep animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions delivered in a ſtyle that is
tolerable; in the other, there is as great a want of common Engliſh as there
is plenty of common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Have you ſeen the ſermons on the
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom and on the Faſt-day? If you read either, ſend for the firſt.
You'll find me degenerate from a gentle bard into a ſnarling critic, if my
poem does not pleaſe (you'll ſay I am no very candid one at preſent:) but
let its fate be what it will, I ſhall lay no ſmall ſtreſs upon the
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome that have approved it. As it is at preſent <hi>in
keeping,</hi> it diſcovers no uncommon impudence, and runs no very great
riſque; but who can anſwer for it, when it has the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs to
<hi>come upon the town?—Ora pro nobis,</hi> muſt ſoon be my motto. It
virtues and faults will then be incapable of addition or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the
pious aſſiſtance of friends muſt—but I am no Roman
Catholic.—The intrinſic merit of a book when it is printed, as well as
the paſt life and converſation of a man that is departed, muſt damn, or
give it immortality—I mean, to a certain degree.—I ſcrible what
comes uppermoſt, and deſire you would do the ſame.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I AM now with regard to the <hi>town</hi> pretty much in the ſame
ſtate in which I expect to be always with regard to the <hi>world</hi>;
ſometimes exclaiming and railing againſt it; ſometimes giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a good
word, and even admiring it. A ſun-ſhiny day, a tavern-ſupper after a play
well acted, and now and then an invigorating breath of air in the Mall, never
fail of producing a chearful effect. I don't know whether I gave you any
account of Quin's acting Falſtaff in my former letter: I really imagined that
I ſaw you littering on one ſide me, ſhaking your ſides, and ſometimes
ſcarce containing yourſelf. You'll pardon the attitude in which I placed
you, ſince at was what ſeemed <hi>natural</hi> at that circumſtance of
time. Comus I have once been at, for the ſake of the ſongs, though I
deteſt it in any <hi>light:</hi> but as a <hi>dramatic</hi> piece the
<hi>taking</hi> of it ſeems a <hi>prodigy</hi>; yet indeed
<hi>ſuch-a-one,</hi> as was pretty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably accounted for by a gentleman
who ſate by me in the <hi>boxes.</hi> This learned ſage, being aſked how
he liked the play, made anſwer, 
<q rend="inline">"He could not tell—pretty well, he
thought—or indeed as well as any other play—he always took it, that
people only came there to ſee and to be ſeen—for as for what was
ſaid, he owned, he never underſtood any thing of the matter."</q> I told
him, I thought a great many of its admirers were in his caſe, if they would
but own it.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it is amazing to conſider to what an
univerſality of learning people make <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1250901200:22"/> pretenſions here.
There's not a drawer, a chair or hackney coach-man, but is politician, poet,
and judge of polite literature. Chimney-ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers damn the Convention, and
black-ſhoe-boys cry up the genius of Shakeſpeare. 
<q rend="inline">"The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of writing Verſe"</q> is a very good
thing; if you have not read it, I would recommend it to you as poetical. But
now I talk of learning, I muſt not omit an interview which I acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
had the other night in company with Lord D— and one Mr. C—. We were
taken to ſup at a private houſe, where I found a perſon whom I had never
ſeen before. The man behaved exceeding modeſtly and well; till, growing a
little merry over a bottle (and being a little countenanced by the ſubject we
were upon) he pulls out of his pocket about half a dozen ballads, and
diſtributes them amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I (not finding at firſt they were
of his own compoſition) read one over, and, finding it a dull piece of
ſtuff, contented myſelf with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that it was exceedingly well
<hi>printed.</hi> But to ſee the man's face on this occaſion would make you
pity the circumſtance of an author as long as you live. His jollity ceaſed
(as a flame would do, ſhould you pour water upon it;) and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for
about five minutes, he ſpoke not a ſyllable. At length, recovering
himſelf, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk about his country-ſeat, about Hough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Hall,
and ſoon after deſired a health, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining (as I found afterwards) that
Lord D— would have given Sir Robert's. But he did not, naming Sir
T— L—: mine, which followed, was that of Mr. L—. Now, who do
you think this ſhould be, but honeſt Ralph Freeman (at leaſt the writer
of the paper ſo ſubſcribed) your father's old friend and intimate, Sir
Robert's right-hand, a perſon that lives elegantly, drives ſix of the
beſt horſes in town, and plays on St. John's organ: (you know Mr. L— is
not <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1250901200:23"/> only Sir Robert's greateſt enemy, but the
Gazet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer's proper antagoniſt.) We were invited to ſee him very civilly,
and indeed the man behaved with the utmoſt good humour, without arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
or any attempts at wit, which, probably, would not have been very
ſucceſsful. Aſk your father what he would ſay to me, if I ſhould join
in the cauſe with his old friend, and take a good annuity under Sir Robert,
which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I might have; and little encouragement, God knows, have I
met with on the other ſide of the queſtion. I ſay, I believe I <hi>might
have,</hi> becauſe I know a certain perſon gives penſions of three pound
a week to porters and the moſt illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, ſtupid fellows you can imagine,
to talk in his behalf at ale-houſes; where they fit ſo long a time, and are
as regularly relieved as one centry relieves another. At leaſt tell him that
I expect in his anſwer to my letter (which I ſhall not allow him to
aſſign to you) he write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to confirm me in my integrity, and to
make me prefer him, and you, and honeſty, to lace, brocade, and the ſmiles
of the ladies, 
<q>Et Veneri, &amp; cunis, &amp; plumis Sardanapali.</q> But I hope
to keep my Hercules in view, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in print or manuſcript; and though I am
as fond of pleaſure as moſt people, yet I ſhall obſerve the rule,

            <p>I deſire I may hear from you next poſt: I have a line or two,

            <p>I HEARTILY thank you for the ſervice your letter did me. And a

of a perſon ſo habitually diſpirited as I have been for ſome time. For
this, and all former favours, as the ſullen fellow ſays in Shakeſpeare, 
<q rend="inline">"I thank you; I am not of many words, but I thank
you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I beg you would ceaſe to apologize for your letters: in the

<hi>ſo</hi>; and, in the next place, you may be aſſured, that no friendly
letter of yours will ever be otherwiſe than infinitely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me.</p>
            <p>I ſent a letter to Mr. Marriett at Bath, to be left with you at
your former place of reſidence; you will be ſo kind as to give it to
him.</p>
            <p>If I wiſh for a <hi>large</hi> fortune, it is rather for the

<hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> it is to gratify myſelf in the company, and in
the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, of my friends.</p>
            <p>Dr. Ratcliff has ſent me a letter, which gives me much
<hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in reſpect of my poem; notwithſtanding, he cannot
forbear adding, that he expects to hear, ſince my pen has ſo well adorned
the fable, that my conduct will, with equal propriety and elegance,
illuſtrate the moral. However, the ſimple approbation of a
<hi>ſincere</hi> man affects one more, than Pliny's panegyric could do, from
a more courtly one.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral errors of the preſs, which neither ſagacity
nor vigilance itſelf, I now ſee, can prevent, and which I beg you to
correct with your pen, in a copy which I muſt get you to preſent to
C— L—, together with the incloſed letter. Pleaſe to be at the
expence of having it ſtitched in purple paper, and gilt at the edges; and I
will repay you.</p>
            <p>I was loitering yeſterday in the coffee-room, when two perſons
came in, well-dreſſed, and called for my poem; read a page or two, and
commended the four lines upon Mr. L— ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely; 
<q rend="inline">("Lov'd by that prince, &amp;c.")</q> repeated them
forty times, and, in the end, got them by heart, mentioned them to a

<hi>was</hi> fired with, and then endeavoured to mimic the prince's way of
talking; but, ſays he, <hi>I'll</hi> ſhew <hi>the four beſt lines in the
poem, and then proceeded to</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"'Twas youth's perplexing ſtage, &amp;c."</q>
which are flat enough, God knows—but to my firſt heroes; one of them
reads, 
<q rend="inline">"When great Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to a grove retir'd."</q>
               <hi>Ay, ay, you know Mr. L— did retire, he was in the ſeceſſion;
read on; you'll find he mentions Delia anon. Don't you remember Mr. L— wrote
a ſong upon Delia? but proceed—you'll find he is going to give a

Pope's;—but how comes Pope to praiſe himſelf there?</hi>

               <hi>No doubt,

            <p>My critics proceeded to the reading of the laſt ſimile
<hi>immediately, without</hi> the lines preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and, agreeing that it

            <p>I FIND ſome difficulty in writing to you on this melancholy
occaſion. No one can be more unfit to attempt to leſſen your grief than
myſelf, becauſe no one has a deeper ſenſe of the <hi>cauſe</hi> of
your affliction. Though I would by no means be numbered by you amongſt the
common herd of your acquaintance, that tell you they are ſorry, yet it were
impertinent in me to mention a mere friend's concern to a perſon intereſted
by ſo many more tender regards. Beſide, I ſhould be glad to alleviate
your ſorrow, and ſuch fort of condolence tends but little to promote that
end. I do not chuſe to flatter you; neither could I, more eſpecially at
this time; but though I could perhaps find enough to ſay to perſons of
leſs ſenſe than you, I know of nothing but what your own reaſon muſt
have ſuggeſted. Concern indeed may have ſuſpended the power of that
faculty; and upon that pretence I have a few things that I would ſuggeſt to
you. After all, it is time alone, that <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will</hi> cure
<hi>all</hi> afflictions, but ſuch as are the conſequence of vice; and
your's, I am ſure, proceeds from a <hi>contrary</hi> principle.</p>
            <p>I heard accidentally of this ſorrowful event, and accompanied you
to London with the umoſt concern. I wiſhed it was in my power to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
your griefs by ſharing them, as I have often found it in yours to augment my
pleaſures by ſo doing.</p>
            <p>All that I can recommend to you is, not to confine your eye to any
ſingle event in life, but to take in your whole circumſtances before you
repine.</p>
            <p>When you reflect that you have loſt one of the beſt of men in a

            <p>WONDERFUL were the dangers and difficulties through which I went,
the night I left you at Barels; which I looked upon as ordained by fate for the
temporal puniſhment of obſtinacy. It was very kind, and in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for
you to endeavour to deter me from the ways of darkneſs; but having a ſort
of <hi>penchant</hi> for needleſs difficulties, I have an undoubted right to
indulge myſelf in them, ſo long as I do <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1250901200:29"/> not inſiſt
upon any one's pity. It is true, theſe ought not to exceed a certain degree;
they ſhould be <hi>lenia tormenta</hi>; and I muſt own the labours I
underwent that night, did not come within the bounds which my imagination had
preſcribed. I cannot forbear mentioning one imminent danger.—I rode
along a conſiderable piece of water covered ſo cloſe with trees, that it
was as probable I might have purſued the channel, which was dangerous, as my
way out of it. Or, to put my caſe in a more poetical light, having by night
intruded upon an amour betwixt a Wood-nymph and a River-god, I owed my eſcape
to Fortune, who conveyed me from the vengeance which they might have taken. I
put up finally at a little alehouſe about ten o'clock, and lay all night
awake, counting the cords which ſupported me, which I could more ſafely
ſwear to than to either bed or blanket. For farther particulars, ſee my
epiſtle to the Paſtor Fido of Lapworth.—Mr. Graves ſays, he
ſhould be glad to ſhew you any civilities in his power, upon his own
acquaintance; and will ſerve you as far as his vote goes, upon my
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation; but is afraid, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſome more
conſiderable friends, your chance will be but ſmall <hi>this</hi> year,
&amp;c. If the former part of this news gives you any pleaſure, I aſſure
you it gives me no leſs to communicate it; and this pleaſure proceeds from

any means to ſerve me; more eſpecially that he will take the trouble of

            <p>I have, ſince I arrived here (which was laſt Saturday night)

ſome ſuch lines, I cannot accurately recollect them. I do not wonder he
pleaſed extremely; but to a conſidering man there is ſomething
ſtrangely diſagreeable, to hear a ſcandalous life recommended by one of
his age, and as much ſatisfaction ſhewn in the review of it, as if it had
been a perfect galaxy of virtues. An Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian audience would have ſhewn
their different ſentiments on this occaſion. But I am acting the part of

            <p>I THANK you for the favour of your laſt letter, particularly your
readineſs in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to me any thing of Mr. Somervile's. It ſo fell
out, that Mr. Outing delivered to me the verſes, and I had the pleaſure of
reading them about a moment before he gave me your epiſtle.</p>
            <p>The town expected ſomething of importance, namely, a motion for a
committee of enquiry into late meaſures, would be moved for to day. If any
thing of this nature has been carried on, I will add an account of it before I
cloſe my letter. In the mean time, it is, I believe, very credible, that Lord
Orford has a continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the King; and that the Duke of

            <p>An odd ſtory enough the following, and I believe true! Somebody
that had juſt learnt that Hor W 's gentleman's name was Jackſon, writes a
letter to Mr Floyer, keeper of the Tower, intimating his maſter's deſire to
ſpeak with him. Floyer dreſſes the next morning, and waits upon
H—e, comes into his room,—
<q rend="inline">"Sir, ſays Horace, I really don't know you.

            <p>YOUR laſt letter gave me a good deal of uneaſineſs, in rgard
to Mr. Somervile's indiſpoſition. I hope, if he is better, you will omit no
opportunity of gratifying me with the news of it. I ſhall be glad to employ
you and Mr. Jago in my little rivulet before winter comes, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1250901200:33"/>
when one muſt bid adieu to rural beauties. Thoſe charming ſcenes, which
the poets, in order to render them more compleat, have furniſhed with ladies,
muſt be ſtript of all their ornaments. Thoſe incomparable nymphs, the
Dryads and the Nereids, which have been my conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions this ſhort
ſummer, will vaniſh to more pleaſing climes; and I muſt be left to
ſeek my aſſiſtance in real beauties, inſtead of imaginary ones. In
ſhort, I am thinking to live part of this winter in Worceſter, or ſome
other town. I was at a concert there, a very full one, lately. I obſerved Dr.
Mackenzie talking to Mr. Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton; and I hope, on that account, he is in his
intereſt; otherwiſe Mr. Somervile would do Mr. Lyttleton great ſervice by
engaging him.—Mr. Lyttleton took occaſion to mention to me, the
obligation he lay under to Mr. Somervile for his letter, as well as his other
deſigns in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour—that he had long received great pleaſure from
that gentleman's pen, and wiſhed for the honour of his acquaintance. I told
him, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the ſatisfaction would be mutual, or to that purpoſe. He
added, that the Chace was an <hi>extremely</hi> beautiful poem, the beſt by
far ever written on the ſubject. But now the fiddles ſqueaked, the
harpſichord jingled, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers began to feel the divine
enthuſiaſm. The god of muſic invaded them as he did the Sibyll of old:

            <p>YOU ſee I am <hi>extremely expeditious</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering your
letter; the reaſon of which is a very powerful one, namely, the information
which I received laſt night, that it would be agreeable to you I ſhould do
ſo. Pleaſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſet aſide the ſum of eighteen pence, or
thereabouts, for letters which you will receive whilſt I am in London; and,
to make it ſeem the leſs profuſely ſquandered, conſider it amongſt
any other caſual expences which you careleſsly ſubmit to, merely to
gratify your curioſity.</p>
            <p>I went the other night, with the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, to ſee 
<q rend="inline">"The Merry Wives of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor"</q> performed at
Covent-Garden. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expreſs how much every thing fell
below my ideas. But I have <hi>conſidered ſince</hi>; and I find, that my
expectations were really more unjuſt than their manner of acting.
<hi>Perſons,</hi> in order to act well, ſhould have ſomething of the
author's fire, as well as a polite education. And what makes this the clearer
to me is, that you hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to one
that you find well performed upon the ſtage.—Nothing can be more
ignorant or affected than the ſcornful airs which ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple give
themſelves at a country play; becauſe, forſooth, they have ſeen plays
in town. The truth is, the chief advantage of plays in town lies entirely in
the ſcenery. You ſeldom obſerve a ſet of ſtrollers without one or two
actors who are quite equal to their parts; and I really know of no good one, at
either of the two Theatres Royal, except Cibber, who rarely acts, and Mrs.
Olive, I will add one more, in <hi>compliance</hi> with my <hi>own</hi> taſte
<hi>merely,</hi> and that is Mr. Neal, a <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1250901200:35"/> fellow who, by
<hi>playing the fool,</hi> has gained my particular <hi>eſteem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the play, we had an <hi>entertainment</hi>;—falſely
ſo called! It was that of Orpheus and Eurydice, the moſt
<hi>un-muſical</hi> thing I ever heard, and which laſted, I believe, three
hours, with ſome intermixtures of Harlequin; both ſo dull, and yet heard
with patience, that I was amazed, aſtoniſhed, confounded; but really a
<hi>man</hi> of <hi>ſenſe</hi> ought not to be ſo; becauſe they were
not calculated for <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I want you here extremely;—pray come up for a week. I
ſuppoſe you will not, ſo I will not argue ſuperfluouſly. However,

upon my hands, for which, if I employ them in ſcribling to my friends, they
are but <hi>ſlenderly obliged</hi> to me. I hope no friend of mine will ever
be induced, by my <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> to do any thing but avoid it; I believe no

<q rend="inline">"Video meliora, &amp;c."</q> It is not from a
ſpirit of jealouſy that I would adviſe my acquaintance to ſeek
happineſs in the regular path of a fixed life. But, though I very highly
approve of it, and envy it, my particular turn of mind would be as little
ſatisfied with it, as it is like to be a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> one. Yet,

which muſt be my lot, till the laſt totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.</p>
            <p>YET, after all, to tell you the truth, I am not pleaſed with being
adviſed to retire. I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other day to Mr. Outing, that I
<hi>had</hi> been ambitious more than I was at preſent, and that I grew
leſs ſo every day. Upon this he chimed in with me, and approved my
deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">"that <hi>he</hi> alſo had been ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but
found it would not do."</q> Do you think I lik'd him much for
this?—no—I wheeled about and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"I did not think with him; for I ſhould always
find myſelf whetted by diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and more violent in proportion to
the intricacy of the game."</q> I ſpent a night with him and Mr. Meredith,
and with him and Mr. Dean: in the latter party he had laid his hand upon his

of which was Broughton the prize-fighter.—Mr. Whiſtler's company
ſeldom <hi>relieves</hi> me on an evening; and I go to plays but
<hi>ſeldom,</hi> becauſe I intend no more to <hi>give countenance</hi> to
the <hi>pit.</hi>—I have got a belt!!! which diſtinguiſhes me as much

pleaſes one.—This I am very poſitive of, that to have a friend of

know how it is, but I abſolutely deſpair of ever being introduced into the
world. It may be objected by ſome (but you will not object it) that I may be
acquainted with a ſufficient number of people that are my <hi>equals,</hi> if
I <hi>will.</hi> They may be my <hi>equals</hi> and <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,</hi> whom
they mean, for aught I care; but their converſation gives me no more
pleaſure than the <hi>canking</hi> of a gooſe, or the quacking of a duck,
in affluent circumſtances. Rather <hi>leſs</hi> indeed of the two,
becauſe the idea of the ſat gooſe flatters one's appetite; but the
<hi>human gooſe</hi> is neither fit to be heard nor eaten. I wiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be <hi>ſhewn into</hi> good company; but, if I can at all diſtinguiſh
the nature of my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is more in hopes of meeting with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
converſation, than any thing elſe. I do not at all inſiſt that my
genius is <hi>better</hi> than that <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1250901200:40"/> of my vociferous
neighbours; if it be <hi>different,</hi> it is a ſufficient reaſon why I
ſhould ſeek ſuch companions as ſuit it; and whether they are found in
high or low life, is little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But you will perhaps diſcern
the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>vanity</hi> in all my endeavours; I will not diſagree
with you, provided you will allow <hi>amuſement</hi> an equal ſhare in
them. It is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be intimate with men of diſtinguiſhed ſenſe,
not of diſtinguiſhed fortune. And this is a vanity which you ſhould not
diſapprove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will bind me a laſting friend to you and your
family.</p>
            <p>I have been over at Shiffnall, and, in order to make myſelf
agreeable, rode a hunting with Mr. Pitt. I confeſs I was ſomewhat diverted;
and my horſe was ſo much an enthuſiaſt, as to be very near running
headlong into a deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I believe, if I were to turn ſportſman, I
ſhould ſoon break my neck, for fear the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould deſpiſe
me.</p>
            <p>I will certainly endeavour to ſee you at Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham; but beg you
would write me a long letter in the mean time; and contrive, if you can, to
make it look like a packet, as your laſt did, for the ſight thereof is
exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
            <p>Though my wiſhes will not ſuffer me to believe that your eyes
are in the danger you repreſent; yet, ſuppoſing them to be only very
weak, I would recommend ſome muſical inſtrument, that is moſt agreeable
to you. I have often looked upon muſic as my dernier reſort, if I ſhould
ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card the world, and turn eremite entirely. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what other
amuſement can make an equal impreſſion in old age.</p>
            <p>I have filled my paper not without difficulty, through the

moſt warm ſtreams of gratitude and affection for you. Adieu!</p>

            <p>YOU muſt give me leave to complain of your laſt letter, three
parts of which is filled with mere apology: I thought we had ſome time
agreed, for our mutual emolument, to lay aſide ceremonies of this ſpecies;
till I was made Poet-laureat, and you Biſhop of Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—Why
Biſhop of Wincheſter, for God's ſake? Why—becauſe—he is
prelate of the Garter—an order, in all kinds of ceremony ſo greatly
abounding.—Here am I ſtill, trifling away my time, my money, and, I
think, my health, which I fancy greatly inferior to what it it would be in the
country. Truth is, I do make ſhift to vary my days a little here; and, 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1250901200:43"/> calling to mind the many irkſome hours, the ſtupid
identity of which I have been ſo often ſick in the country, I conclude that
I am leſs <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy</hi> than I ſhall find myſelf at

ſtays in the Mall till ten every night.—Mrs. Olive, Mrs. Wof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fington,
Barbarini, and Mr. Garrick (happy man!) are gone over to Ireland, to act there
for two months.—Mr. Outing, the laſt time I ſaw him, told me how Dr.

were to give vent to our ſpleen, and cenſure affections ſo bluntly as
ſome people do. I would not venture this hint, if I did not believe you

            <p>IF a friend of yours who lived in the fartheſt part of China were
to ſend you a pinch of ſnuff wrapt up in a ſheet of writing-paper, I
conceive the ſnuff would improve in value as it travelled, and gratify your
curioſity extremely by the time it reached your fingers ends—Very
true—you will ſay:—why then, <hi>that very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
was my inducement to write to you at this time; and that ſort of
progreſſional value is what you are to place upon my letter. For, be
aſſured, I am not ignorant how much this my letter doth reſemble a pinch
of ſnuff in point of ſignificancy, and that both the one and the other are
what you may as well do without.—My letter is as follows.</p>
            <p>You muſt know, in rainy weather, I always ſoothe my melancholy
with the remembrance of <hi>diſtant</hi> friends only: you cannot eaſily
conceive the high value I place upon their good qualities at ſuch a time:

with me this ſummer. Refined ſenſe is what one is apt to value one's
ſelf upon; but really, unleſs one has a refined ſoul or two to converſe

you, and a few more friends: as Falſtaff ſays to Hal,

not let your ſupercilious friends come in upon you with then prudential
maxims.—Conſider, you are now of the proper age for pleaſure, and

bold ſtroke yet, that I know of. Saddle your mule, and let us be jogging to
the great city. I will be anſwerable for amuſement.—Let me have the

as your friendſhip. Come—let us go forth into the opera-houſe; let us
hear how the cunuch-folk ſing. Turn your eyes upon the lilies and roſes,
diamonds and rubies; the Belindas and the Sylvias of gay life! Think upon Mrs.
Olive's <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1250901200:49"/> inexpreſſible comicalneſs; not to mention
Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſley's joke-abounding phyſiognomy! Think, I ſay, <hi>now</hi>: for

            <p>Pray now do not write me word that your <hi>buſineſs</hi> will

the fruit piece which you ſee, being the moſt ſeemly ornaments of the

critical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that <hi>I</hi> loved him for nothing ſo much as his
flocci-nauci-nihili-pili fication of money.</p>
            <p>Mr. A— was honourably acquitted: Lord A—, who was
preſent, and behaved very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1250901200:52"/> they ſay, was
hiſſed out of court. They proved his application to the carpenter's ſon,
to get him to ſwear againſt Mr. A—, though the boy was proved to have
ſaid in ſeveral compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (<hi>before</hi> he had been kept at Lord
A—'s houſe) that he was ſure the thing was acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Finally, it
is believed he will recover the title of A—ea.</p>
            <p>The apprehenſion of the whores, and the ſuffocation of four in
the round-houſe, by the <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of the keeper, engroſſes the
talk of the town. The ſaid houſe is rebuilding every day (for the mob on
Sunday night demoliſhed it), and re-demoliſhed every night. The Duke of M
—gh, J— S— his brother, Lord C— G—, were taken
into the round-houſe, and confined from eleven at night till eleven next day:
I am not poſitive of the Duke of M—gh, the others are certain: and that
a large number of people of the firſt faſhion went from the round-houſe
to De Veil's, to give in informations of their uſage. The juſtice himſelf
ſeems greatly ſcared; the proſecution will be carried on with violence,
ſo as probably to hang the keeper, and there is an end.</p>
            <p>Lord Bath's coachman got drunk and tumbled from his box, and he was
forced to borrow Lord Orford's. Wits ſay, that it was but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for my
Lord Orford's <hi>coachman</hi> to drive my Lord Bath, as my Lord Bath
<hi>himſelf</hi> had driven my Lord Orford. Thus they.</p>

            <head>XXII. To Mr. Graves, on Benevolence and Friendſhip.</head>
            <opener>

<date>Jan, 19, 1741-2.</date>
               </dateline> 
               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I CANNOT forbear immediately writing to you: the pleaſure your
laſt letter gave me puts it out of my power to reſtrain the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings
of my benevolence. I can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that, upon ſome extraordinary
inſtances of friendſhip, my heart might be <hi>ſi ſort attendri,</hi>
that I could not bear any reſtraint upon my ability to ſhew my gratitude.
It is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I made upon reading to day's paper, which contains an
account of C. Khevenhuller's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in favour of the Queen of Hungary. To
think what ſublime affection muſt influence that poor unfortunate Queen,
ſhould a faithful and zealous General revenge her upon her enemies, and
reſtore her ruined affairs!</p>
            <p>Had a perſon ſhewn an eſteem and affection for <hi>me,</hi>
joined with any elegance, or without any elegance, in the expreſſion of it,
I ſhould have been in acute pain till I had given ſome ſign of my
willingneſs to ſerve him.—From <hi>all</hi> this, I conclude that I
have more humanity than ſome others.</p>
            <p>Probably enough I ſhall never meet with a larger ſhare of
happineſs than I feel at preſent. If not, I am thoroughly convinced, my
pain is greatly ſuperior to my pleaſure. That pleaſure is not
abſolutely dependent on the mind, I know from this, that I have enjoyed
happier ſcenes in the company of ſome friends, than I can poſſibly at
preſent;—but alas; all the time you and I ſhall enjoy together,
abſtracted from the reſt of our lives, and lumped, will not perhaps amount
to a ſolid year and a half. How ſmall a proportion!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1250901200:54"/>People will ſay to one that talks thus, 
<q rend="inline">"Would you die?"</q> To ſet the caſe upon a
right footing, they muſt take away the hopes of greater happineſs in
<hi>this</hi> life, the feares of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miſery hereafter, together with
the bodily <hi>pain</hi> of dying, and addreſs me in a diſpoſition
betwixt mirth and melancholy; and I could eaſily reſolve them.</p>
            <p>I do not know how I am launched out ſo far into this complaint: it
is, perhaps, a ſtrain of conſtitutional whining; the effect of the
wind—did it come from the winds? to the winds will I deliver it: 
<q> 
                  <l>Tradam protervis in mare Creticum,</l> 
                  <l>Portare ventis—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I will be as happy as my fortune will permit, and make others ſo: 
<q> 
                  <l>Pone me pigris ubi <hi>nulla campis</hi>
                  </l> 
                  <l>
                     <hi>Arbor</hi> aeſtiva recreatur aura.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I will be ſo. The joke is, that the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you gave
of that country was, that you had few trees about you; ſo that I ſhould
<hi>trick</hi> fortune if ſhe ſhould grant my petition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly. But in
earneſt, I intend to come and ſtay a day or two with you next ſummer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Whiſtler is at Mr. Goſling's, bookſeller, at the Mitre and
Crown, in Fleet-ſtreet, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired much after you in his laſt letter to
me. He writes to me; but I believe his affection for one weighs leſs with
him, while the town is in the other ſcale. Though he is very obliging. I do
not know whether I do right, when I ſay I believe we three, that is, in
ſolitary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, have an equal idea of, and affection for, each
other. I ſay, ſuppoſing each to be alone, or in the country, which is
nearly the ſame; for ſcenes alter minds as much as the air influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
bodies. For inſtance, when Mr. Whiſtler <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1250901200:55"/> is in town, I
ſuppoſe we love him better than he does us; and when we are in town, I
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame may be ſaid in regard to him.</p>
            <p>The true burleſque of Spenſer (whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic is
ſimplicity) ſeems to conſiſt in a <hi>ſimple</hi> repreſentation of
ſuch things as one laughs to <hi>ſee</hi> or to <hi>obſerve</hi> one's
ſelf, rather than in any <hi>monſtrous</hi> contraſt between the thoughts
and words. I cannot help thinking that my added ſtanzas have more of his
manner than what you ſaw before, which you are not a judge of, till you have
read him.</p>

            <p>THOUGH your laſt letter ſeemed to put my correſpondence upon
an oſtentatious footing, namely, an inclination to be witty, yet I aſſure
you it was not any punctilious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that kind that has kept me
ſo long ſilent. Indeed with ſome people one would ſtand upon the
niceſt punctilios; for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity
itſelf, yet it ſurely weighs as much as the acquaintance of the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving. But this is trifling, becauſe it can have no reference to a
perſon for whom I have the greateſt affection.</p>
            <p>In regard to my Oxford affairs, you did all I could expect. I have
wrote ſince to Mr. M—, who, either for your ſake or mine, will, I
dare ſay, ſettle them to my ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1250901200:56"/>I wiſh your journey and head-ach would have
permitted you to have been a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerning the ſeat of
the Muſes; but I ſuppoſe nothing material diſtinguiſhed your
fortnight.</p>
            <p>Mr. Whiſtler has relapſed at Whitchurch; but purpoſed, when I
laſt heard from him, to go to London before this time. I do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
underſtand his ſchemes, but ſhould have been ſincerely glad of his
company with me this winter; and, he ſays, he is not fond of
London.—For my part, I deſigned to go thither the next month, but the
fever (which is chiefly violent in towns) diſcourages me.</p>
            <p>Some time ago, I read Spenſer's Fairy Queen; and, when I had
finiſhed, thought it a proper time to make ſome additions and corrections
in my trifling imitation of him, the School-miſtreſs. His ſubject is
certainly bad, and his action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly confuſed; but there are
ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in him that charm one. Thoſe which afford the greateſt
ſcope for a ludicrous imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are, his ſimplicity and obſolete
phraſe; and yet theſe are what give one a very ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in
the peruſal. The burleſque which they occaſion is of quite a different
kind to that of Philips's Shilling, Cotton's Traveſtie, Hudibras, or Swift's
works; but I need not tell <hi>you</hi> this. I incloſe a copy, for your
amuſement and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which, if franks are plentiful, you may return, and
ſave me the <hi>tedious</hi> trouble of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over again. The other
paper was, <hi>bona fide,</hi> written to divert my thoughts from pain, for the
ſame reaſon that I ſmoaked; actions equally reputable.</p>
            <p>Mr. Somervile's poem upon hawking, called, 
<q rend="inline">"Field Sports,"</q> I ſuppoſe, is out by this
time. It was ſent to Mr. Lyttleton, to be read to the Prince, to whom it was
inſcribed. It ſeems he is fond of hawking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1250901200:57"/>I have often thought thoſe to be the moſt
enviable people whom one leaſt envies—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, married men are the
happieſt that are; but I cannot ſay I envy them, becauſe they loſe all
their merit in the eyes of other ladies.</p>
            <p>I beg ſincerely that you would write in a week's time at
furtheſt, that I may receive your letter <hi>here,</hi> if I ſhould go from
home this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I will never uſe any thing by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but

            <p>I AM glad the ſtay you make in Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire amuſes you, even
though it puts you upon preferring the place you reſide at to my own place of
reſidence. I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be from the prejudice of being born at
the Leaſows, or from any real beauty in the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I would wiſh
no other, would ſome one, by an addition of two hundred pounds a year, put it
in my power to exhibit my own deſigns. It is what I can now do in no other
method than on paper. I live in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeconomical manner, that I muſt
not indulge myſelf in the plantation of a tree for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I have
glutted myſelf with the extremity of ſolitude, and muſt adapt my expences
more to ſociable life. It is on this account that it ſeems more prudent for
me to buy a chair while <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1250901200:58"/> I am in town, than to carry down
twelve gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas for the model of the tomb of Virgil, an urn, and a ſcheme or
two more of like nature.—I long to have my picture, <hi>diſtantly</hi>
approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a profile (the beſt manner I can think of to expreſs
myſelf), drawn by Daviſon. I have ſeen your ſiſter's, and think the
<hi>face</hi> well done in every reſpect;—but am greatly indignant with
other things of a leſs fixed nature The cap, though a good cap enough, has a
vile effect; the formality of ſtays, &amp;c. not agreeable.—I do not
know if you ſaw the picture of a Scotch girl there at full length! Miſs
Graves has the advantage of her's, or any picture there, in her perſon; but
certainly this girl's hair is inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly charming! There is the
genteeleſt negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in it I ever ſaw in any picture:—what follows,
but that I wiſh your ſiſter would give orders to pull off her cap, and
have hair after the manner of this picture?—To ſpeak abruptly; as it
<hi>is,</hi> I diſapprove it: were it altered, I ſhould like it beyond any
I ever ſaw.—I am glad you are reading Spenſer: though his plan is
deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and his <hi>invention</hi> leſs wonderful than moſt people
imagine, who do not much conſider the obviouſneſs of allegory; yet, I
think, a perſon of your diſpoſition muſt take great delight in his
<hi>ſimplicity,</hi> his good-nature, &amp;c. Did you obſerve a ſtanza
that begins a canto ſomewhere,

and cared not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. After that, Pope's Alley made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him
ludicrouſly; and in that light, I think, one may read him with pleaſure. I

really in love with him. I think even <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1250901200:59"/> the metre pretty
(though I ſhall never uſe it in earneſt); and that the laſt Alexandrine

            <p>I DEPENDED a good deal on an immediate anſwer from you, and am
greatly fearful you never received a packet of little things, which I ſent
you to Oxford, incloſed in a frank; tho' if arrived at all, it muſt have
arrived ſeveral days before you left it. I beſeech you to ſend me a line
upon the receipt of theſe, which will free me from much perplexity; though it
is doubtful whether I can defer my ſchemes ſo as to make your criticiſms
of ſervice. I would have you ſend them notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>I cannot help conſidering myſelf as a ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (though God
knows how poor a one in every ſenſe!) and the company as my game. They
<hi>fly up</hi> for a little time; and then <hi>ſettle</hi> again. My cue is,
to diſcharge my <hi>piece</hi> when I obſerve a number together. This week,
they are ſtraggling round about their paſture, the town: the next, they
will flock into it with violent appetites; and then diſcharge my little piece
amongſt them.—I aſſure you, I ſhall be very eaſy about the
acquiſition of any ſame by this <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1250901200:60"/> thing; all I much
wiſh is, to loſe none; and indeed I have ſo little to loſe, that this
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſcarcely affects me.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay it muſt be very incorrect; for I have added eight or
ten ſtanzas within this fortnight. But inaccuracy is more excuſable in
ludicrous poetry than in any other. If it ſtrikes <hi>any,</hi> it muſt be
merely people of <hi>taſte</hi>; for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>wit</hi> without taſte
(which comprehends the larger part of the critical tribe) will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
deſpiſe it. I have been at ſome pains to ſecure myſelf from A.
Philips's misfortune, of mere <hi>childiſhneſs,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"little charm of placid mien, &amp;c."</q> I have
added a ludicrous index, purely to ſhew (fools) that I am in
jeſt;—and my motto 
<q rend="inline">"O quà ſol habitabiles illuſtrat oras,
maxime principum",</q> is calculated for the ſame purpoſe. You cannot
conceive how large the number is of thoſe that miſtake burleſque for the
very fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it expoſes (which obſervation I made once at the
Rehearſal, at Tom Thumb, at Chronon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hotonthologos; all which are pieces of

if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeriouſly calls this, or rather, burleſque, a childiſh

poetry may be called trifling, folly, and weakneſs, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what

            <p>PRESUMING you may be at Tiſſington by this time, I write to
ſolicit a deſcription of the ſeveral adventures, accidents, and
phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, that have amuſed you in your travels; and will <hi>equally</hi>
affect me, as they relate to you. Above all things, be particular in regard to
your calculations reſpecting Mickleton. I would have certainly met you there,
as you deſired me: there is no company I am fonder of than yours, and your
ſiſters; and no place at which I have ſpent more agreeable hours than
Mickleton. But your brother has loſt one of his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations in my eye;
that is, his <hi>irregularity</hi> of houſe-keeping. He has ſeveral left,
which are ſufficient to preſerve my utmoſt eſteem; but that was a jewel
indeed! I love to go where there is nothing much more in form than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I
have no objection to viſit <hi>young, unſettled people,</hi> with a
mountebank's inconſiſtency in my equipage. But where a conſiderable
family keeps up its forms (as marriage requires) I ſhould not care to appear
with an hired horſe, and a <hi>Sancho</hi> for my valet. The caſe is, I
<hi>could</hi> live in a way genteel enough, and uniformly ſo; but then, I
muſt forego megrims, whims, toys, and ſo forth. Now, though it gives me
pain, <hi>ſometimes,</hi> not to appear of a piece; yet that
<hi>infrequent</hi> pain is not a balance for the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial happineſs
which I find in an urn, a ſeal, a ſnuff-box, an engraving, or a buſt.
Ambition, too, as it puts me upon wiſhing to make a figure, makes me very
indifferent as to making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, every-day-gentlemanly figure; and ſaves
me from appearing ſolicitous about the 
<q rend="inline">"res <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1250901200:62"/>

vanity to you in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts; but I hope you will rather conſider it as a mark
of my <hi>confidence,</hi> and, conſequently, my ſincere eſteem and
affection: for, I take it, the former ſeldom ſubſiſts without the
latter. And as to what I ſaid about my love of flattery, I hope, you will not
conſtrue it as any <hi>hint</hi>; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I am right, would you be ſo
ungenerous as not to comply with me. I ſincerely think, that flattery
amongſt foes is abſolutely deſirable; amongſt one's <hi>common
acquaintance,</hi> a behaviour <hi>rather inclining</hi> to it: but amongſt
<hi>friends,</hi> its conſequences are of too dangerous a nature.</p>

<q rend="inline">"taedet coeli convexa tueri."</q> I am miſerable,

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE juſt been ſpending my evening at a coffee-houſe; and,
notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed effect of liquor, am ſitting down to write
to a perſon of the cleareſt head I know. The <hi>truth</hi> is, I write to
pleaſe <hi>myſelf,</hi> which I can do no other way ſo effectually; upon
which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, you are not obliged to me for the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> I make in
correſpondence. Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things will be expected from my
<hi>ſituation</hi>; but extraordinary things ought never to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from
<hi>me.</hi> I keep no political company, nor <hi>deſire</hi> any, as, I
believe, you know. If you enquire after the ſtage—I have not ſeen
Garrick; but, more fortunately for <hi>you,</hi> your brother <hi>has.</hi> Me
nothing has ſo much tranſported as young Cibber's <hi>exhibition</hi> of
Parolles, in Shakeſpeare's 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>All's well that ends well.</hi>"</q> The
character is admirably written by the author; and, I fancy, I can diſcover a
great number of hints which it has afforded to Congreve in his Bluff. I am apt
to think a perſon, after he is twelve years old, laughs annually leſs and
leſs: leſs heartily, however; which is much the ſame. I think Cibber
elicited from me as ſincere a laugh as I can ever recollect. Nothing, ſure,
can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to his repreſentation of Parolles in his bully-character;
except the figure he makes as a ſhabby gentleman. In his firſt dreſs he
is taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, as you may imagine: in the laſt, he wears a ruſty black coat, a
black ſtock, a black wig <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1250901200:64"/> with a Ramillie, a pair of
black gloves; and a face!—which cauſes five minutes
laughter.—Inſtead of politics, I have tranſcribed theſe epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams

            <p>YOU ſay it is no way unpleaſing to you to receive my letters; if
you ſay the thing that is not, the fault, like others, produces its own
puniſhment.—You are now my only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent. I do not know what
reaſon Whiſtler has for not caring to write, unleſs he thinks that we
ought not to trouble ourſelves about one another, but bend our whole
endeavours to mend our fortunes; though I do not <hi>know</hi> his
imaginations. I was afraid, after what I had ſaid concerning
<hi>ſameneſs</hi> in my laſt, that you would interpret it to your own
diſadvantage; but was too lazy to write my letter again, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I
could deny the extent of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to any one beſides myſelf in ſome

            <p>Some time next week, do I purpoſe to ſet out for London. The
reaſons for my going at all do <hi>barely</hi> preponderate. I cannot,
<hi>conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> print any thing. I have two or three little
matters in hand: none that I am greatly fond of, much leſs that are at all
mature. One is, what you have ſeen, though in its mortal ſtate, 
<q rend="inline">"Flattery, or the fatal Exotic;"—</q>ſo very
quotidian and copious a ſubject, that I diſlike it entirely. Another, 
<q rend="inline">"Elegies in Hammond's Metre,"</q> but upon
<hi>real</hi> and natural ſubjects: this I have objections to. A third, 
<q rend="inline">"An Eſſay on Reſerve;"</q> the ſubject
genteel, I think, but ſcarce ten lines finiſhed. A fourth, 
<q rend="inline">"An Eſſay, in blank Verſe, on Oeconomy, with
Advice to Poets on that Head, concluding with a ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous Deſcription of a
Poet's Apartment."</q> I <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1250901200:66"/> think it were better to
<hi>annex</hi> that poem thus, to prevent its claſhing, like an earthen pot,
againſt Philips's ſilver vaſe, though his humour lies chiefly in the
language. My favourite ſcheme is a poem, in blank verſe, upon Rural
<hi>Elegance,</hi> including caſcades, temples, grottos, hermitages,
green-houſes, which introduces my favorite epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſode of the Spaniſh lady
(you will wonder <hi>how,</hi> but I think <hi>well</hi>) to cloſe the
firſt book. The next, running upon planting, &amp;c. will end with a viſta
terminated by an old abbey, which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an epiſode concerning the

               </gap>ken from Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides, Virgil's Murrain, and Ovid's
Peſtilence, &amp;c. The two epiſodes in great forwardneſs;—but,

            <p>DR. Swift would not have ſcrupled to print your parody, with his
name to it. Why ſhould you, <hi>without</hi> your name? I had a violent
inclination to print it in a large folio, four leaves, price four-pence: but I
dare not do it, for fear you ſhould think it of evil importance with regard
to the clergy. You excel me infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely in a way in which I take moſt
pleaſure; odd pictureſque deſcription. Send me word whether I ſhall
print it or no—and that right ſoon.—I have lingered in town till
now, and did not receive your letter till this morning.—I do not know
whether I ſhall ſend you with this letter a little thing which I wrote in
an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and, with proper <hi>demands</hi> of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed as the
author, ſold for two guineas.—Next time I am in town, I will get money
like a haberdaſher. I will amuſe myſelf with find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the people's
weak ſide, and ſo furniſh them with <hi>ſuitable
nonſenſe.</hi>—I would have you <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1250901200:68"/> do the
ſame.—Make your wit bear your charges. Indeed, as to the little parody
you ſend, it would fix your reputation with men of ſenſe as much as
(greatly more than) the whole tedious character of Parſon Adams. I read it
half a year ago; the week after I came to town; but made Mr. Shuckburgh take it
again, imagining it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a very mean performance.—I liked a tenth
part pretty well; but, as Dryden ſays of Horace (unjuſtly) he ſhews his
teeth without laughing: the greater part is <hi>unnatural</hi> and
<hi>unhumourous.</hi> It has ſome advocates; but, I obſerve, thoſe not
ſuch as I ever eſteemed taſters. Finally, what makes <hi>you
endeavour</hi> to like it?</p>
            <p>My printer was preparing his bill for the School-miſtreſs, when
I ſtopped him ſhort, with a hint to go to Dodſley, who has not yet
reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me for Hercules. Let <hi>the dead</hi> bury their <hi>dead.</hi>
Dr. Young's Complaint is the beſt thing that has come out this ſeaſon
(theſe <hi>twenty years,</hi> Pope ſays) except mine, for ſo
<hi>thinks</hi> every author, who does think proper to ſay ſo: poor Pope's
hiſtory, in Cibber's Letter, and the print of him upon the Mount of Love (the
<hi>coarſeſt</hi> is moſt <hi>humorous</hi>) muſt ſurely mortify him.
Your ſiſter does me great honour to think my hint any thing; but I am quite
zealous in my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of that Scotch lady's hair. I will <hi>ever</hi> aim
at <hi>oddneſs,</hi> for the future; it is cheaper to follow taſte than
faſhion, and whoever he be that devotes himſelf to <hi>taſte</hi> will be
<hi>odd</hi> of courſe.—You ſend me the verſes on Lord Hay: they
were hacked about town three months ago, and I ſaw them. The town is
certainly the ſcene for a man of curioſity.—I do not purpoſe to be
long away; but I muſt think of retrenching—I have ten thouſand things
to tell you, but I have not room. Such people as <hi>we</hi> ſhould meet as
regularly to compare notes as tradeſmen do to ſettle accounts, but oftener;
there is no good <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1250901200:69"/> comes of long reckonings;—I ſhall
forget half;—I think it ſhould be four days in a fortnight—it
would not do;—it would make one <hi>mindful</hi> of, and conſequently
more uneaſy on account of, abſence. Every one gets poſts, preferments,
but myſelf.—Nothing but my ambition can ſet me on a footing with
them, and make me eaſy. Come then, lordly pride! &amp;c. The devil thought

they come <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1250901200:70"/> in large bodies, armed with couteaus, and attack
whole parties, ſo that the danger of coming out of the play-houſes is of
ſome weight in the oppoſite ſcale, when I am diſpoſed to go to them
oftener than I ought.—There is a poem of this ſeaſon, called

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO-MORROW morning I ſet out for Cheltenham, to make trial of the
waters there. I ſhall, perhaps, add to this letter at ſeveral ſtages, and
conclude it at the place to which I am going; ſo that, like thoſe
ſprings, you may, perhaps, find it impregnated with the nature of all thoſe
places thro' which it paſſes; perhaps quite the contrary.</p>
            <p>—, if I miſtake not the man, is an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of works of
taſte, &amp;c. though I am going to inſtance this oddly: he was a hearty
ſtickler for my poem upon Hercules at Bath, as D. Jago ſent me word.
Perhaps it was complaiſance to Mr. Lyttleton, with whom, Charles, &amp;c. he
is intimate, if, as I ſaid before, I do not miſtake the perſon. I flatter
myſelf, I do not; and I hope that we two ſhall ever find the ſame
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or the ſame kind of perſons, our friends, and alſo our
enemies.</p>
            <p>If I get over this ill habit of body, depend upon it, I
<hi>will</hi> have a <hi>reverend</hi> care of my health, as Sir John
Falſtaff adviſes the Chief Juſtice. <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1250901200:74"/> I ſolve all
the tempeſts that diſturb my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>wind:</hi> it plagues
me, firſt, in the ſhape of a bad appetite, then indigeſtion, then
low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirits and a flux of pale water, and at night by watchings,
reſtleſſneſs, twitchings of my nerves, or a ſleep more diſtracted
than the moſt active ſtate of watchfulneſs. But I think purging
leſſens all theſe ſymptoms, and I truſt my ſcheme that I am
entering upon is right.</p>
            <p>I was, on Monday, at Hagley, to wait on Mr. Lyttleton, who was gone
to Sir John Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's, to ſee his grand edifice.—As to Mrs.
Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton, if her affability is not artificial, I mean if it does not owe its
original (as it <hi>ought to do</hi> its <hi>management</hi>) to art, I cannot
conceive a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more amiable;—but <hi>ſenſe</hi> and
<hi>elegance</hi> cannot be ſeigned: to <hi>exhibit</hi> them, is to
<hi>have</hi> them.</p>
            <p>How is my ſong ſet? Miſs Carrington pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it that favour;
but I have never ſeen a copy, nor knew of its being to be printed. Howard has
ſet another of mine, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived laſt poſt; but my harpſichord is
out of order, and I have found no one yet to explain the hieroglyphicks which
convey it. You may probably find it in ſome future number of the Britiſh
Orpheus. 
<q rend="inline">"By the ſide of a ſtream, &amp;c."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am in as good ſpirits this inſtant as ever I was in my life:
only 
<q rend="inline">"Mens turbidum laetatur."</q> My head is a little
confuſed; but I often think ſeriouſly, that I ought to have the moſt
ardent and <hi>practical</hi> gratitude (as the Methodiſts chuſe to
expreſs themſelves) for the advantages that I have: which, though not
eminently ſhining, are ſuch, to ſpeak the truth, as ſuit my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
humour, and, conſequently, deſerve all kind of acknowledgment. If a poet
ſhould addreſs himſelf to God Almighty, with the moſt earneſt thanks
for his goodneſs in allotting him an eſtate that was over-run with
ſhrubs, thickets, and coppices, variegated with barren rocks and 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1250901200:75"/> precipices, or floated three parts in four with lakes and
marches, rather than ſuch an equal and fertile ſpot as the 
<q rend="inline">"ſons of men"</q> delight in; to my
apprehenſion, he would be guilty of no abſurdity.—But of this I have
compoſed a kind of prayer, and intend to write a little ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation on the
ſubject; this kind of gratitude I aſſuredly ought to have, and have. For
my health, if one reflects, a country-fellow's ſtock of it would be unfit for
ſolitude; would diſpoſe one rather to bodily feats, and, what Falſtaff
calls in Poins, <hi>gambol</hi> faculties, than mental contemplations, and
would give one that kind of pain which ſprings from <hi>impatience.</hi> My
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was given me originally good; and with regard to it now (as G.
Barnwell ſays) 
<q rend="inline">"What am I?—What I <hi>have made
myſelf.</hi>"</q> Or, to ſpeak with Milton, 
<q> 
                  <l>Him after all diſputes</l> 
                  <l>Forc'd I abſolve: all my evaſions vain,</l> 
                  <l>And reaſonings, tho' thro' mazes, only lead</l> 
                  <l>But to my own conviction. Firſt and laſt</l> 
                  <l>On me, me only, as the ſource and ſpring</l> 
                  <l>Of all corruption, all the blame lights due.</l>
               </q> Though this
is but vulgarly expreſſed in Milton neither.</p>
            <p>Jago has been here this laſt week, and I drove him to Dudley
Caſtle, which I long to ſhew you: I never ſaw it (ſince I was the
ſize of my pen) before: it has great romantic beauty, though perhaps
Derbyſhire may render it of ſmall note in your eye.</p>
            <p>One is tempted to addreſs the K— as Harry the Eighth does
his wife, <hi>mutatis mutandis;</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>Go thy ways, George!</l>

            <p>I have a mind to write an ode in praiſe of him, and in rivalſhip

and familiarity, as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſentiments of a perſon returning
from a diſlike to a thorough approbation of him, which ſeems, at preſent
the ſenſe of the nation.—But herein I am not in earneſt.—</p>
            <p>My pen has run on a whole page at random. It amuſes me to
encourage it, and ſo I will try to get a frank.</p>
            <p>I am this moment arrived at Cheltenham, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an expenſive and
fatiguing journey. I called yeſterday at Micklington; ſaw the portico, and
ſnapped up a bit of mutton at your brother's; drank a diſh of tea with
Miſs S—; and, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſtrongeſt remonſtrances,
perſiſted in an endeavour to reach Cheltenham after five o'clock. The
conſequence was, that, about ten, I found myſelf travelling back again
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Stowe; and had undoubtedly wandered all night in the dark, had I not
been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately met by a waggoner's ſervant, who brought me back to the

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not a contrived apology, or an excuſe, which I am going to
offer for the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments I have given you. I have actually been ſo
much out of order ever ſince I wrote to you, nay, ever ſince I <hi>formed a
deſign</hi> of a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day expedition to L—, that it never has been in my
<hi>power</hi> to execute my intentions. My ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo has not yet taken away my
ſenſes; God knows how ſoon it may do; but my nerves are 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1250901200:77"/> in ſuch a condition, that I can ſcarce get a wink of
even <hi>diſordered</hi> reſt for whole nights together. May you never know
the miſery of ſuch invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary vigils! I ride every day almoſt to
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue; which only tends to make my want of ſleep more
<hi>ſenſible,</hi> and not in the leaſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it. I have
<hi>ſpirits</hi> all day, good ones; though my head is dizzy, and I never
enterprize any ſtudy of greater ſubtlety than a news-paper. I cannot ſay
the journey to L— would be at all <hi>formidable</hi> to me; for I ride
about fifteen miles, as I compute it, every day before dinner. But the nights,
from home, would be inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me. I have fatigued Mrs. Arnold's
aſſiduity, to the injury of her health; by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning her to ſit in
my room a'nights, light my candle, put it out again, make me perſpiratory
wheys, and ſlops; and am amuſed by the moſt ſilly animadverſions
ſhe is capable of making. I never knew her uſefulneſs till now; but I
<hi>now</hi> prefer her to <hi>all</hi> of <hi>her ſtation.</hi> If I get
over this diſorder, concerning which I have bad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, you may
depend upon ſeeing me the firſt Sunday I dare venture forth. I hope
<hi>you</hi> continue mending. The benefit of <hi>riding</hi> is only not
univerſal, and would cure <hi>me</hi> too, could I but make one previous
advance towards health. Have you tried cold bathing? Perhaps it may not ſuit
your caſe. I wiſh I had not dropt it. I take my fluctuation of nerves to be
cauſed, as that of the ſea is, by wind; which I am continually pumping up,
and yet find it ſtill renewed. When I am juſt ſinking to ſleep, a
ſudden twitch of my nerves calls me back again—to watchfulneſs, and
vexation! I conſider myſelf as in the ſtate of the philoſopher, who
held a bullet betwixt his finger and thumb, which, whenever he was about to
nod, was ordered ſo as to fall into a large braſs pan, and 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1250901200:78"/> wake him—that he might purſue his
lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I will mention one circumſtance regarding the weakneſs of my
nerves;—and not my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for I told you thoſe were
tolerable:—the leaſt noiſe that is, even the falling of a
fire-ſhovel upon the floor, if it happen unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhocks my whole
frame; and I actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a gun fired, behind my back, unawares,
amidſt the ſtillneſs of the night, would go near to kill me with its
noiſe.</p>
            <p>I am juſt going to bed; and dare not be any more attentive, as I
hope to cloſe my eyes for a minute. So fare you well!</p>
            <p>It is now ſix o'clock in the morning, and I have had about five
hours middling ſleep; which encourages me greatly: ſo I will <hi>hope</hi>
to be able to ſee you next Sunday ſevennight.</p>
            <p>What think you of the battle? Are not you ſo much in love with our
King, that you could find in your heart to ſerve him in any profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
poſt he might aſſign you?</p>
            <p>Capt. L— is wounded in the thigh.</p>
            <p>When I ride in my chair round my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, I am as much
ſtared and wondered at, as a giant would be that ſhould walk through
Pall-mall. My vehicle is at <hi>leaſt as</hi> uncommon hereabouts as a
blazing comet. My chief plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lies in finding out a thouſand roads, and
delightful little haunts near home, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of: egregious
ſolitudes, and moſt incomparable bye-lanes! where I can as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I DID not part from you without a <hi>great deal</hi> of melancholy.
To think of the <hi>ſhort</hi> duration of thoſe interviews which are the
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of one's <hi>continual</hi> wiſhes, has been a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has
plagued me of old! I am ſure I returned home with it then, more aggravated as
I foreſaw myſelf returning to the ſame ſeries of melancholy hours from
which you had a while relieved me, and which I had <hi>particularly</hi>
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under all this laſt ſpring! I wiſh to God, you might happen
to be ſettled not far from me: a day's-journey diſtance, however; I mean,
an <hi>eaſy</hi> one. But the odds are infinitely againſt me. I muſt only
<hi>rely</hi> for my happineſs on the hopes of a never-ceaſing
correſpondence!</p>
            <p>Soon after you were gone, I received my packet. The hiſtory of
Worceſterſhire is mere ſtuff. T— I am ſo fond of, that, I
believe, I ſhall have his part of the collection bound over again, neatly and
ſeparately. But ſure Hammond has no right to the leaſt <hi>inventive</hi>
merit, as the preface-writer would inſinuate. I do not think there is a
ſingle thought, of any eninence, that is not literally tranſlated. I am
aſtoniſhed he could not content himſelf with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little an
original.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lyttleton and his lady are at Hagley. A malignant caterpillar
has demoliſhed the beauty of all our <hi>large</hi> oaks. Mine are ſecured
by their littleneſs. But, I gueſs, the park ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fers; a large wood near
me being a mere win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-piece for nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>At preſent, I give myſelf up to riding and thoughtleſsneſs;
being reſolved to make trial of <hi>their</hi> efficacy towards a tolerable
degree of health <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1250901200:80"/> and ſpirits. I wiſh I had you for my
director. I ſhould proceed with great confidence of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; though I am
brought very low by two or three fits of a fever ſince I ſaw you. Had I
written to you in the midſt of my diſpirited condition, as I was going, you
would have had a more tender and unaffected letter than I <hi>can</hi> write at
another time: what I think, perhaps, at all times; but what ſickneſs can
alone elicit from a temper fearful of whining.</p>
            <p>Surely the 
<q rend="inline">"nunc formoſiſſimus annus"</q> is to be
limited to hay-harveſt. I could give my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: but you will imagine them
to be the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of country people in a pleaſing employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the full
verdure of the ſummer; the prime of pinks, woodbines, jaſmines, &amp;c. I
am old, very old; for few things give me ſo much mechanical pleaſure as
lolling on a bank in the very heat of the ſun, 
<q> 
                  <l>When the old come forth to play</l> 
                  <l>On a ſun-ſhine holiday—</l>
               </q> And yet it is as much
as I can do to keep Mrs. Arnold from going to neighbouring houſes in her
ſmock, in deſpite of decency, and my known diſapprobation.</p>
            <p>I find myſelf more of a patriot than I ever thought I was. Upon
reading the account of the battle, I found a very ſenſible pleaſure, or,
as the Methodiſts term it, perceived my heart <hi>enlarged,</hi> &amp;c. The
map you ſent me is a pretty kind of <hi>toy,</hi> but does not enough
particularize the ſcenes of the war, &amp;c. which was the end I had in view
when I ſent for it.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"O dura meſſorum ilia!"</q> About half the
appetite, digeſtion, ſtrength, ſpirits, &amp;c. of a mower, would make me
the happieſt of mortals! I would be underſtood literally, and

            </opener>
            <p>I AM tempted to begin my letter as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius does his harangue: 
<q rend="inline">"Multa medehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur à vobis, ni ſtudium
virtutis veſtrae om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia exſuperet."</q> You contrive interviews of about a
minute's duration; and you make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in order to diſappoint one; and
yet, at the ſame time that your proceedings are thus vexatious, force one to
bear teſtimony to the ineſtimable value of your friendſhip! I do
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, that you ought to compound for the diſappointment you
have cauſed me, by a little letter every poſt you ſtay in town. I ſhall
now ſcarce ſee you till next ſummer, or ſpring at ſooneſt; and then
I may probably take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to viſit you, under pretence of ſeeing
Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhire. Truth is, your prints have given me <hi>ſome</hi> curioſity
to ſee the original places. I am grateful for your intentions with regard to
giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me part of them, and impertinent in deſiring you to convey them to me
as ſoon as you can well ſpare them. Let me know if they are ſold
ſeparately at the print ſhops. I think to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to my new
acquaintance, Mr. Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton Brown. I like the humour of the ballad you
mention, but am more obliged for your partial opinion of me. The notes that
fall upon the word 
<q rend="inline">"Cannon, Cannon,"</q> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably expreſſive
of the ſound, I dare ſay: I mean, jointly with its echo; and ſo, I
ſuppoſe, you will think, if you ever attended to the Tower-guns. I find I
cannot afford to go to Bath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to my London-journey; though I look
upon it as a proper method to make my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in town more agreeable. I
ſhall, probably, <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1250901200:82"/> be there about the firſt of December;
or before, if I can accelerate my friend Whiſtler's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The pen I write
with is the moſt diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of pens! But I have little elſe to ſay;
only this,—that our good friend, Jack Dolman, is dead at Aldridge; his
father's benefice.</p>
            <p>I beg, if you have leiſure, you would incloſe me in a frank the
following ſongs, with the notes: 
<q rend="inline">"Stella and Flavia," "Gentle Jeſſy," "Sylvia,
wilt thou waſte thy prime?"</q> and any other that is new. I ſhould be glad
of that number of the Britiſh Orpheus which has my ſong in it, if it does

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may reaſonably have expected a letter before now, either as an
acknowledgment for your genteel preſent, or, at leaſt, by way of
information that I had received it. The prints have given me a pleaſure,
which, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, would ſoon have languiſhed, if I had bought
them at a ſhop; but which is now built upon the eſteem I have for the
giver, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a more durable foundation.—As for 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1250901200:83"/> the reſt, I am moſt pleaſed with the view of
Matlock, and ſhall have no peace of mind till I have ſeen the original. I
have been gilding the frames, and wiſhing all the while for your
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>I will alter the ballad according to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; dividing it into
three parts, and adding a ſtanza or two to the ſhorteſt, ſome time or
other. I have had no opportunity of trying the tunes. 
<q rend="inline">"Arno's vale"</q> has pretty words, and recommends
itſelf to one's imagination by the probability that it was written on a real
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The ſimilitude of rhimes in the cloſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. For all
that has been the ſubject of my letter hitherto, as the country people ſay,
I can but thank you, and I do very ſincerely; though as to the ſongs I will
repay you.</p>
            <p>I have your poem by me, which I have read often with the greateſt
pleaſure. I have many obſervations to make; and only defer the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication till I know whether you have a copy at Tiſſington to turn
to. I think, the moſt <hi>polite</hi> and <hi>ſuitable</hi> title to it
would run:—
<q rend="inline">"The Villa, a Poem; containing a Sketch of the
preſent Taſte in Rural Embelliſhments, written in 1740."</q> Your preface
has a pretty thought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe; otherwiſe is on no account to be
admitted. Pardon my freedom; but, I think, there is no manner of occaſion for
a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and thoſe ſtrokes, which I <hi>know</hi> to be real modeſty
in <hi>you,</hi> the world will undoubtedly impute to affectation.—If you
give me encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, I will be very minute in my criticiſms, allowing you
to reject ten to one that you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of.</p>
            <p>Whiſtler is gone to Briſtol, and has bilked me.—I ſaid,
he is gone; but, I believe, he is only upon going.—I linger at home, in
hopes of gleaning up a little health; and through a dread of being ill in a
place where I can be leſs <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1250901200:84"/> attended on.—I can
continually <hi>find out</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my preceding diet that, I
<hi>think,</hi> diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me; ſo that I am conſtantly in hopes of
growing well:—but, perhaps, I never ſhall;

            <p>When I was a ſchool-boy, I never knew there <hi>was any ſuch
thing</hi> as perſpiration; and now, half my time is taken up in
conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate connexion betwixt that and health, and
endeavouring to promote it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lyttelton has built a kind of alcove in his park, inſcribed,

it, an owl.</p>
            <p>As to ſchemes, I have none with regard to the world, women, or
books. And I hate, and have deferred writing to you (for ſome days) for that
reaſon. I am ſick of exhibiting ſo much ſameneſs:—I am
conſtantly poring over ſome Claſſic, which I conſider as one of
Idleneſs's better ſhapes. But I am impatient to be doing ſomething that
may tend to better my ſituation in ſome reſpect or other. It is

            </opener>
            <p>YOU muſt know, my laſt letter to you was written before I
received yours from Tiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington; and I ſhould take ſhame upon myſelf
for not anſwering it, were I not furniſhed with this excuſe—that I
waited for a frank for you.—There are but few things I have to ſay to
you, and ſuch as are not worth tranſcribing; yet, as our diſtance from
one another requires it, I will ſcrawl them over as negligently as I can, to
let you ſee I lay no ſtreſs upon them. A good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for lazineſs!
you will ſay: and lazy enough I am, God knows! I believe, any one who knows
me thoroughly will think, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſo great an inconſiſtence
as there is betwixt my words (in my poem) and my actions.—This is what
the world calls hypocriſy, and is determined to look upon with
<hi>peculiar</hi> averſion. But, I think, the hypocrite is a
<hi>half</hi>-good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. A man certainly, conſidering the force 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1250901200:88"/> of precedent, deſerves ſome praiſe who keeps up
appearances; and is, no doubt, as much to be commended for talking better than
he acts, as he is to be blamed for acting worſe than he talks. So much for
caſuiſtry. I would ſeem, you muſt know, to have ſome meritorious
views in talking <hi>virtuouſly</hi>; but who does not know that every one
who writes poetry looks directly with his face towards praiſe, and whatever
elſe his eye takes in is viewed obliquely? Praiſe, as I ſaid to
foible-confeſſing W—, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, the noted, and the adequate
reward of poetry; in which ſort he that rewards me, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven reward him, as
Sir John Falſtaff ſays.—There is ſomething very vain in repeating
my own ſayings; but I could not conſcientiouſly uſe a joke to you which
I had uſed in another letter, without owning it.—In ſhort, it is
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have ſome <hi>earthly</hi> aim in view; the next world,
whether it be in reality near or far off, is always <hi>ſeen</hi> at a
diſtance. All that the generality of young people can do is, to act
<hi>conſiſtently with</hi> their expectations there.—Now, though
fame, &amp;c. be obviouſly enough in the eye of reaſon diſſatisfactory;
yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per enough to ſuffer one's ſelf to be deluded with the hopes
of it, that is, it is proper to cheriſh ſome worldly hopes, that one may
avoid impatience, ſpleen, and one ſort of <hi>deſpair:</hi> I mean that
of having no <hi>hopes</hi> here, becauſe one ſees nothing here that
deſerves them. If I were in your caſe, I would make all the efforts I was
able towards being a Biſhop. That ſhould be my earthly aim: not but I would
act with ſo much indifference as to bear all diſappointment
unconcernedly—as, I dare ſay, you will.—There is but one
paſſion that I put upon an equally ſprightly footing with ambition, and
that is love; which, as it <hi>regularly tends</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, requires
certain favours from fortune <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1250901200:89"/> and circumſtance to render
it proper to indulge in.—By this time you think me crazed—as it
often happens to me to doubt, <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> whether I am not: but if
it be the 
<q rend="inline">"mentis gratiſſimus error,"</q> I do not mind.
You are very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to endeavour to continue my madneſs and
vanity.—I ſhould be as glad to ſee Mr. Graves, your brother, as any
one I know: I live in a manner wherein he would find many things to exerciſe
his good nature.</p>
            <p>Pamela would have made one good volume: I wonder the author, who has
ſome <hi>nice</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrokes, ſhould not have ſenſe enough to
ſee that.—I beg you will collect all the hints, &amp;c. of your own, or
others, that you think may tend to the improvement of my poem againſt winter;
that you would mention any flat lines, &amp;c.—Write me word ſome time

            <p>YOU are upon very <hi>good</hi> terms with me, and <hi>have</hi>
been all along. I gueſſed the cauſes of your ſilence, and have been
ſincerely ſorry for them; not however that I did not believe you were more
happy than any one in the world who is neither a lover nor a poet, though not
able to turn himſelf for money-bags.—I am <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1250901200:90"/> really
going to London; and am about the purchaſe of an elegant pair of piſtols
from Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham. I indulge myſelf in this expence, becauſe they ſhall
ſerve in two capacities: one while to garniſh my chair, another while my
horſe. And ſome time next week you will probably ſee your old friend on
horſe-back, armed <hi>at all points,</hi> and as very a knight, to all
<hi>appearance,</hi> as any body.</p>
            <q>—Well! they ſay the Owl was a Quaker's Daughter—one
knows what one IS, but one does not know what one SHALL be. 
<bibl>Ophelia in Hamlet.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>But I digreſs. If I juſt call to ſee you, God forbid that I
ſhould be burthenſome to you. I will ſend my horſes to H—, and
lodge there, or ſomewhere. But I am perfectly impatient to unboſom my
ſoul to you, and to ſee Mrs. Jago, whom I ſhould have mentioned
firſt.—Wedneſday or Tueſday indeed ſeems he moſt likely
day.—Though I am not ſure; nor do you confine yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Poor Mariett! <hi>I</hi> too am emaciated; but I hope, by means of
ſome warm weather, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>plus d'embonpoint.</hi> I deſign to call
upon him, and keep him in countenance.</p>
            <p>My ballad, in the midſt of your hurry, muſt appear as ridiculous
as Cinna the poet does, when he ſwears nothing but death ſhall reſtrain
him from addreſſing Brutus and Caſſius (and that the night before the
battle) with two dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel verſes—and thoſe the worſt I have ever
read; and that makes the ſimile the more juſt. It is now a good deal
metamorpoſed. Your parody is prodigiouſly droll: the firſt line de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
me! I think I could furniſh Mrs. K— with as good mottoes, and as cheap,

            </opener>
            <p>THERE is not a ſyllable you tell me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning yourſelf in your
laſt letter, but what applied to <hi>me</hi> is moſt literally true. I am
ſenſible of the daily progreſs I make towards in ſignificancy, and it
will not be many years before you ſee me arrived at the <hi>ne plus
ultra.</hi> I believe it is abſolutely impoſſible for me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a
conſiderable degree of knowledge, tho' I can underſtand things well enough
at the time I read them. I remember a preacher at St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's (I think it was
Mr. E—) made a notable diſtinction betwixt <hi>apprehenſion</hi> and
<hi>comprehenſion.</hi> If there be a real difference, probably it may find a
place in the explication of my genius. I envy you a good <hi>general</hi>
inſight into the writings of the learned. I muſt aim at nothing higher than
a well concealed ignorance.—I was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon reading your letter,
<hi>when</hi> it was that you and Mr. Whiſtler and I went out of the road of
happineſs. It certainly was where we firſt deviated from the turnpike road
of life.—Wives, children, alliances, viſits, &amp;c. are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
objects of our ſocial paſſions; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no we can, through
particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, be happy <hi>with,</hi> I think it plain enough
that it is not poſſible to be happy <hi>without</hi> them. All attachments
to inanimate beauties, to curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and ornaments, ſatiate us
preſently.—The fanciful tribe has the diſadvantage to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
prone to err in the choice of <hi>laſting</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and when our
paſſions have habitually wandered, it is too difficult to reduce them into
their proper channels. When this is the caſe, nothing but the change or
variety of amuſements ſtands any chance to make us eaſy, and it is not 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1250901200:93"/> long ere the whole ſpecies is exhauſted.—I agree
with you entirely in the neceſſity of a <hi>ſociable</hi> life in order
to be happy. I do not think it much a paradox, that any company is better than
<hi>none.</hi> I think it obvious enough as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hour, and as to
any future influence, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude has exceeding ſavage effects on our
diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.—I have wrote out my elegy: I lay no manner of
ſtreſs but upon the piety of it.—Would it not be a good kind of
motto, applied to a perſon you know, that might be taken from what is ſaid
of <hi>Ophelia</hi> in <hi>Hamlet,</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>I tell thee, faithleſs prieſt!</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have amuſed myſelf often with this ſpecies of writing
ſince you ſaw me; partly to divert my preſent <hi>impatience,</hi> and
partly as it will be a picture of moſt that paſſes in my mind; a
por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait which <hi>friends</hi> may value.—I ſhould be glad of your
profile: if you have objections, I drop my requeſt.—I ſhould be
heartily glad if you would come and live with me, for any ſpace of time that
you could find convenient.—But I will depend on your coming over with Mr.
Whiſtler in the ſpring. I may poſſibly take a jaunt towards you ere
long: the road would furniſh me out ſome viſits; and, by the time I
reached you, perhaps, afford me a kind of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>max of happineſs. If I do not,
I ſhall perhaps be a little time at Bath. I do not ſpeak of this laſt as
a ſcheme from which I entertain great expectations of pleaſure. It is long

body, were changed; and others, ever ſo heterogeneous, ſubſtituted in
their place. After this, it would be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to ſay, that the
<hi>pretended</hi> heir to theſe kingdoms could not alter it, were he to
ſubvert the Britiſh conſtitution; which muſt, out of all doubt, be the
conſequence of his ſucceſs. The rebellion, you may gueſs, is the
ſubject of all converſation. Every individual nailer here takes in a
news-paper (a more <hi>pregnant</hi> one by far than any of the London ones),
and talks as familiarly of <hi>kings</hi> and <hi>princes</hi> as ever Maſter
Shallow did of John Gaunt. Indeed it is no bad thing that they do ſo; for I
cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the people want ſo much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by
<hi>ſermons,</hi> of the abſurdities of <hi>popery,</hi> as they do by
<hi>news-papers,</hi> that <hi>it</hi> may <hi>poſſibly</hi> prevail. The
reaſons and arguments too in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the preſent Government are ſo
<hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>obvious,</hi> that even I, and every country
'ſquire, and every country clerk, and Sam Shaw the taylor, ſeem to be as
much maſters of them as the Biſhops themſelves. I muſt not ſay we
could expreſs them ſo politely.—I like <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1250901200:95"/> Secker's
the beſt of any ſermon on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He gives his audience a view of
ſuch evil conſequences from a <hi>change,</hi> as no man of ſenſe can
poſſibly doubt of, when fairly ſtated: and, I own, I cannot ſee one
ſingle <hi>good</hi> it could produce, in compenſation for its inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and abundant <hi>miſchiefs.</hi>—I have read Dr. Sherlock's ſermon on
this occaſion: and I have read Mr. Warburton's; and, at your requeſt, I
will read his Legation.</p>
            <p>I have often thoughts of a jaunt as far as your country this winter.
Some kind of pilgrimage I muſt make, to avoid a lethargy.—Public places
I want to viſit a little; to peep at and renew my ideas of the
<hi>world's</hi> vanity; but either Bath or London would ſteep me ſo far in
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, that I ſhould not probably emerge before the middle of next
ſummer. I have ſpent this laſt ſummer agreeably enough with ſome of
my young relations, Mr. Dolman's children.—They have an excellent taſte
for their years.—I have been upon ſeveral jaunts with the ſon to
Ditchfield, Worceſter, Mr. Fletcher's, &amp;c. amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, what I could,
under the loſs of his father. Miſs W— F— aſked very
earneſtly after you. Two of the ſiſters have been with me at the
Leaſows, and upon ſeveral parties of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in my chair.—Broom is
diſpoſed of—I do not underſtand upon what inducement.—After
all, I am miſerable;—conſcious to myſelf that I am too little
ſelfiſh: that I ought now or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to aim at ſome addition to my
fortune; and that I make large advances towards the common cataſtrophe of
<hi>better</hi> poets, poverty—I never can attend enough to ſome
twelve-penny matter, on which a great deal depends.—My amour, ſo far as
I indulge it, gives me ſome pleaſure, and no pain in the world.—I
have read Spenſer once again, and I have added full as much more to my
<hi>School-miſtreſs,</hi> in regard to <hi>number of</hi> 
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1250901200:96"/> 
               <hi>lines; ſomething</hi> in point of <hi>matter</hi>
(or <hi>manner</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>which</hi> does not diſpleaſe me. I would
be glad if Mr. — were, upon your requeſt, to give his opinion of
particulars, for two reaſons; as you ſay he has ſome taſte for this
kind of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as he is my enemy, and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, find out its
deficiencies.</p>
            <p>I have a reaſon of a moſt whimſical kind, why I would wiſh

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I BELIEVE it is impoſſible for me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree with you on any
other ſcore, than the ſcanty pittances you allot me of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and,
if I have diſcloſed any ſymptoms of reſentment on that account, you
will, perhaps, overlook them, out of regard to the motive from which they
proceeded.—I thank you for your peruſal of that trivial poem. If I were
going to print it, I ſhould give way to your remarks <hi>implicitly,</hi> and
would not <hi>dare</hi> to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But ſo long as I keep it in
manuſcript, you will pardon my ſilly prejudices, if I chuſe to read and
ſhew it with the addition of moſt of my new ſtanzas. I own, I have a
fondneſs for ſeveral, imagining them to be <hi>more</hi> in Spenſer's
way, yet more independent on the antique <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1250901200:97"/> phraſe, than
any part of the poem; and, on that account, I cannot yet prevail on myſelf to
baniſh <hi>them</hi> entirely; but were I to print, I ſhould (with
<hi>ſome</hi> reluctance) give way to your ſentiments (which I know are
juſt), namely, that they render the work too diffuſe and flimſy, and
ſeem rather excreſcences than eſſential parts of it.</p>
            <p>But of theſe things I ſay no more now. I purpoſe ſtaying a
month with Mr. Whiſtler in December, if it ſuits him; and then I hope I
ſhall have a great deal of your company. Let me hear ſomething in your next
of your <hi>domeſtic affairs.</hi> I beg you would not make any grand
deciſion, without giving me ſome previous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. I eſteem this as
due to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I have ſo long profeſſed for you, and from the
friendſhip you have ſo long profeſſed for me.</p>
            <p>I look upon the death of the two Lords as equally decent upon their
reſpective principles. Lord Kilmarnock, I ſuppoſe, joined the rebels
through a view of bettering his circumſtances, conſcious to himſelf that
he was guilty of a crime the moment he did ſo. This is agreeable to his
ſpeech before the Lords, and to that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy which he diſcovered upon
the ſcaffold. Death, aggravated by guilt, would ſit heavier upon him than
upon the other, even ſuppoſing him to have had the ſame reſolution.
Balme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino's life was quite <hi>unie,</hi> and his death equal to the character
he aimed at. We are to obſerve, that he meant to ſuffer as a Friend to the
Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts, a Soldier, and a Scotſman. The firſt he manifeſted when he came
out of the Tower, by his reply of 
<q rend="inline">"God ſave King J—s;"</q> the ſecond, by
his dreſs, and numberleſs oſtentations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity; the laſt, by
his plaid night-cap. Did you hear the ſtory of his ſending a meſſage to
Lord Kilmarnock? 
<q rend="inline">"that he had been practiſing <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1250901200:98"/>
how to lye upon the block, and had found out, the eaſieſt way of receiving
the blow was, to bite his tongue hard: or even if he bit it off, it was no
matter, they ſhould have no farther uſe for it."</q> His behaviour ſeems
to have wanted coolneſs, or elſe to equal that of Adrian, Cato, Sir T.
More, &amp;c. or any of thoſe heroes who had ſpirit enough to make an
oſtentation of their unconcern. I had, from the printed accounts of their
behaviour, an idea of their perſons, exactly conſormable to the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription I read afterwards in your paper;—but enough—you
ſend me ſterling matters of fact, and I return you tinſel
obſervations.—I thank you for accenting Cro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mêrtie and
Balme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>no; I learnt Culloden from you <hi>before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have had little company ſince I ſaw you.—One day indeed
I was ſurprized by a viſit from Mr. Thomſon, Author of the
Seaſons.—Mr. Lyttelton introduced him.—I have not room to tell
you all that paſſed.—They praiſed my place
extravagantly;—propoſed alterations, &amp;c. Thomſon was very
facetious, and very complaiſant; invited me to his houſe at Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.
There were many things ſaid worth <hi>telling,</hi> but not <hi>writing</hi>
to you.—This has been a ſummer that I have ſpent more
<hi>ſocially</hi> than any one theſe three years. I expect a good deal more
company this week, the next, and the week after.—Lady Luxborough talks of
coming, and I believe <hi>will,</hi>—The viſit would bring my little

Principles.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE lately received a letter from Mr. Whiſtler, which conveys
your compliments to me, and, by ſo doing, prompts me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the
receipt of your last kind letter. I obſerve you adhere ſtrictly to the
apoſtolical precept of being 
<q rend="inline">"ſwift to <hi>hear,</hi> ſlow to
<hi>ſpeak</hi>;"</q> the latter part of which I would fain conclude you
underſtand too literally.</p>
            <p>Your neighbour, I ſee, is not a little embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with his
mills at Whitchurch. I have long had an eye upon his advertiſement in the
London Evening Poſt, and been not a little ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized thereat. What has
the name of a poet to do with the publication of lands and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? or the
idea of harmony with the noiſe of a water-mill? yet has he extracted muſic
from the ſubject, and mirth from his miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; having ſent me a
ballad upon the miller, written with much eaſe and ſome drollery.</p>
            <p>As to the light in which you place your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fortunes, I can
only ſay, that you have not that ſituation I could wiſh you for your
<hi>own ſake:</hi> for ſo far as <hi>I</hi> am concerned in your
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I can aſſure you very faithfully, that no circumſtances in
the world could more endear you to my affection, or recommend you to my
reſpect, than the preſent. My <hi>affection,</hi> you will eaſily
obſerve, from the very <hi>nature</hi> of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general, would
ſtand no chance to be increaſed by your promotion; and as for reſpect, if
I knew the degree you deſired, I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit myſelf of it to your
ſatisfaction <hi>now</hi>; and were you ſettled at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> I
ſhould expect that you would require no <hi>more</hi> from me upon that 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1250901200:100"/> account; at leaſt in private: ſo that, ſo far as
either <hi>deference</hi> or <hi>friendſhip</hi> is concerned, you are an
Archbiſhop to <hi>me</hi> to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.—As to figure
in the world, it depends much, I know, upon advancement; and yet even here you
will be ever <hi>ſure</hi> of that kind of weight which ingenuity gives;
diſcernable to the <hi>ſmaller</hi> indeed, but undoubtedly the more
<hi>valuable</hi> part of the world;—but this is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as it is
<hi>philoſophy,</hi> and as it is <hi>advice;</hi> neither of which is it
ſuitable for me to ſuggeſt to you—
<q rend="inline">"Alcinoo Poma, &amp;c."</q> As to the long ſeries
of <hi>my</hi> lamentations, I will not now enter upon the reaſonableneſs
of them. It is a ſubject, to tell you the truth, on which you cannot reply
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome danger of hurting me.—As for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics (you will blame
this letter for dwelling ſo much upon the ſubject of yours;) but as for
politics, I think <hi>poets</hi> are <hi>tories</hi> by nature, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
them to be by nature poets.—The love of an individual perſon or family,
that has worn a crown for many ſucceſſions, is an inclination greatly
adapted to the fanciful tribe. On the other hand, mathematicians,
abſtract-reaſoners, of no manner of attachment to perſons, at leaſt to
the <hi>viſible</hi> part of them, but prodigiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the ideas
of virtue, liberty, and ſo forth, are generally <hi>whigs.</hi> It happens
agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enough to this maxim, that the whigs are friends to that wiſe,
plodding, unpoetical people the Dutch.—The Tories, on the other hand, are
taken mightily with that ſhewy, oſtentatious nation the French. Foxhunters,
that reſide amongſt the beauties of nature, and bid defiance to art, in
ſhort, that have intellects of a poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>turn,</hi> are frequently
tories; citizens, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, &amp;c. that ſcarce ſee what nature is, and
conſequently have no pretenſions to a poetical taſte, are, I think,
generally argumentative and whiggiſh;—but perhaps I carry this too
far.—<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1250901200:101"/> Something there is in it however, you will
ſee: not that I would apply what I here ſay to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular revolutions,
&amp;c. I would only advance ſomething general and ſpeculative. Nor would I
approve or condemn by this any one ſet of people now exiſting. Nor would I
have you pretend to fiſh out my party from any thing I have ſaid; for I am
of none.—The letter I ſent you laſt was <hi>occaſional,</hi> and
when I ſee you I will tell you the occaſion. I abſolutely agree with you
in every tittle of your political obſervations.—I am glad I do; for I
know the poiſonous nature of party: and though we are <hi>neither</hi>
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet I ſhould fear it. My ſchemes are <hi>doubtful</hi> at
preſent, but my face is ſet towards Bath.—I am confident of the
ſervice thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would do me.—I hope you will exhilarate me with
a letter ſoon.—I would fain have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out a letter to amuſe
you after ſo long a ſilence, but I find myſelf unable: even <hi>as</hi>

            <p>THOUGH I feel an irreſiſtible propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to write to you this
very poſt, yet I cannot ſay that I am able to advance any thing tending
either to your own or my ſatisfaction.—What is worſt of all is, I
cannot fix the time of ſeeing you with ſo much preciſion as I would
always endeavour where my pleaſure is ſo much concerned—I will tell
you the whole affair.—I <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1250901200:102"/> have for a long ſeaſon
propoſed to drink the Bath waters this ſpring; and <hi>did</hi> think of
ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in a week's time, when I received your letter, purpoſing to
ſtay there a month; and from thence take a circuit which ſhould indulge me
in a ſight of you, Mr. Whiſtler, and ſome few others in my way home. The
latter part of this ſcheme (tho' far the more agreeable to me) was rather
doubtful and precarious; depending (as you expreſs it) on the ſtate of my
finances after a month's continuance at Bath; which I conſidered, and
<hi>do</hi> conſider, as a very probable means of bettering my
conſtitution.—Now I covet to ſee you ſo much, that I would bring
nothing but health in competition.—What I wiſh is, that you could, with
convenience, either <hi>haſten</hi> or <hi>delay</hi> your journey, that you
might find me before mine, or after my return, though I ſhould infinitely,
and for many reaſons, prefer the former. I long to talk with you particularly
now. I have much to ſay in regard to our friend's amour, to which you alluded
in your laſt. I requeſt it as a favour of you, that you would conjure him,
by the friendſhip I have ever borne him, and by any eſteem which he has
ever profeſſed for me, that he would do nothing very <hi>material</hi> in
the affair till I have talked it over, and given him my faithful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,

<q rend="inline">"quod cenſet amiculus."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am not willing the balance ſhould turn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the whig
ſide: I would give it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter equilibrium, if the following ſuggeſtion
might effect it. Tories, I ſaid, have great, and ſometimes partial
affections for the <hi>perſon</hi> of a king.—We will ſuppoſe that
kings are alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately good and bad: their loyalty to the good one is
commendable; their partiality to the bad one not to be vindicated. Whigs have
<hi>no</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>no</hi> gratitude, towards to the good prince:
there they are wrong. They are ſevere upon the <pb n="88" facs="tcp:1250901200:103"/> bad one,
in which they are juſtifiable. I wiſh I had not begun theſe wholeſale
diſtinctions, this miſerable ſpecimen of my politics. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
againſt all epiſtolary diſputes. I am now embarraſſed in one, on much
ſuch another ſcore, which fills up all my letter; for I love the laſt
word, like a ſcold or a child.—I thank you for your little anecdotes
from time to time: you may depend upon it, that I have never heard any thing
<hi>before</hi>; for I never <hi>do</hi> hear any thing.—I am one very
thankful letter in debt to your neighbour Whiſtler. I have at preſent
nothing but the <hi>propenſity</hi> of a good correſpondent; but I will
write ſoon. In the mean time, if you ſee him, aſk him if he goes to Bath
or Briſtol this ſeaſon.—I beg you would write to me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

            </opener>
            <p>IT is now, I believe, near half a year ſince I had the favour of a
letter from you. When I wrote laſt, I diſcovered a more than ordinary
ſolicitude for <hi>one</hi> immediate anſwer. It puzzles me to account for
your unuſual ſilence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than upon ſuppoſition of ſome
offence you have taken: and it puzzles me as much to gueſs by what behaviour
of mine I have been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to give you that offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1250901200:104"/>I am vain enough to imagine that the little
merit I have, deſerves ſomewhat more regard than I have met with from the
world. Be that as it will, the diſappointment I muſt undergo, by any
<hi>appearance</hi> of neglect from the friends I value, would more effectually
diſpirit me than any other whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I have publiſhed my deſign of viſiting you, and Mr. Whiſtler
in Oxfordſhire, to all the world. A thouſand incidents have hitherto
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfered with it, which I will not now recount. But when I look back upon
the regular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of them, it looks as if Deſtiny had ſome hand
in detaining me. The moſt <hi>vigorous</hi> of my <hi>hopes</hi> dwell upon
ſeeing you next win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though I am not a little indulgent to
<hi>thoſe</hi> that tell me I may ſee you long before.</p>
            <p>I have brought my place here to greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than it has ever
yet appeared in; and, with the <hi>mob,</hi> it is in ſome vogue.
Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I do not know that I ever reliſhed it leſs in my life than
I have done this ſummer. Bad health, bad ſpirits, no company to my mind,
and no correſpondences, are enough to blaſt the ſweeteſt ſhades, and
to poiſon the pureſt fountains. Some of theſe misfortunes I can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to my own miſconduct, and it embitters them. The two laſt I can leſs
account for, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at all times done all I was able to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend myſelf to

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM under ſome apprehenſion that you dread the ſight of a
letter from me, as it ſeems to lay claim to the compliment of an anſwer. I
will therefore write you one that ſhall wave its <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1250901200:107"/>
privilege, at leaſt till ſuch time as your leiſure encourages, or your
preſent diſſipation does not forbid you to ſend one.—I dare now
no longer expatiate upon the affair you have in hand; it is enough for me, if
you will excuſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I <hi>have</hi> taken. I have often known
<hi>delay</hi> produce good effects in ſome caſes which even ſagacity
itſelf could not ſurmount; and, if I thought I did not go too far, would
preſume to recommend it now. You know I have very little of the temper of an
alderman. I almoſt hate the <hi>idea</hi> of wealthineſs as much as the
<hi>word.</hi> It ſeems to me to carry a notion of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtagnation,
and inſignificancy. It is this diſpoſition of mine that can
<hi>alone</hi> give any weight to the advice I ſend you, as it proves me not
to give it through any partiality to fortune. As to what remains, you are, I
hope, aſſured of the value I muſt ever have for you in <hi>any</hi>
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the regard I ſhall always ſhew for any that belongs
to you. I cannot like you <hi>leſs</hi> or <hi>more.</hi>—I now drop
into other matters. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, I ſee, is taken at loſt; pray what are the
ſentiments of your political companions? I dined ſome time ago with Mr.
Lyttelton and Mr. Pitt, who both agreed it was worth twenty thouſand men to
the French; which is a light in which I never uſed to conſider it. Any
little intimation that you pleaſe to <hi>confer</hi> upon me, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables me to
ſeem <hi>wiſe</hi> in this country for a month; particularly if I take care
to adjuſt my face accordingly. As I was returning laſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day from church,
whom ſhould I meet in my way, but that <hi>ſweet-ſouled</hi> bard Mr.
James Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in a chaiſe drawn by two horſes lengthways.—I
welcomed him into the country, and aſked him to accompany Mr. Lyttelton to
the Leaſows (who had offered me a viſit) which he promiſed to do. So I am
in daily expectations of them and all the world this week. I fancy they will 
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1250901200:108"/> laviſh all their praiſes upon <hi>nature,</hi>
reſerving none for poor <hi>art</hi> and <hi>me.</hi> But if I ever live, and
am able to perfect my ſchemes, I ſhall not deſpair of pleaſing the
ſew I firſt began with; <hi>the few friends prejudiced in my favour,</hi>
and then 
<q rend="inline">"Fico por los malignatores."</q> Cenſures will not
affect me; for I am armed ſo ſtrong in <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that they will
paſs by me as the idle wind which I regard not. I think it pretty near equal,
in a country place, whether you gain the ſmall number of taſters, or the
<hi>large crowd</hi> of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. The latter are more frequently met with,
and <hi>gape, ſtupent,</hi> and <hi>ſtare</hi> much more. But one would
chuſe to pleaſe a few <hi>friends</hi> of taſte before mob or gentry, the
great vulgar or the ſmall; becauſe therein one gratifies both one's
ſocial paſſions and one's pride, that is, one's <hi>ſelf</hi>-love.
Above all things, I would wiſh to pleaſe <hi>you;</hi> and if I have a
wiſh that projects or is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent beyond the reſt, it is to ſee you
placed to your ſatisfaction near me; but Fortune muſt vary from her uſual
treatment before ſhe favours me ſo far.—And yet there <hi>was</hi> a
time, when one might probably have prevailed on her. I knew not what to
do—The affair was ſo intricately circumſtanced—your
ſurprizing ſilence after the hint I gave.—Mr. D— offering to
ſerve any friend of mine; nay, preſſing me to uſe the
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.—His other relations, his guardians, teizing him with ſure
ſymptoms of a rupture in caſe of a refuſal on <hi>their</hi>
ſide.—Mr P— ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me if the place were <hi>ſold,</hi>
which it could not legally be. Friendſhip, propriety, imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
ſelf-intereſt (which I <hi>little</hi> regarded) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to
diſtract me; I think I never ſpent ſo diſagreeable an half-year ſince
I was born. To cloſe the whole, I could not <hi>foreſee</hi> the event,
which is almoſt foretold in your laſt letter, and I knew I could not
ſerve you; but I muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a <hi>neceſſary</hi> one. In ſhort,
when can tell <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1250901200:109"/> you the whole affair at leiſure, you will

            <p>IT is not much above two hours ſince I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your obliging
letter, and I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet down to anſwer it.—To ſpeak the
truth, I had almoſt given you over: I imagined you had taken umbrage at
ſome expreſſion or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in my epiſtle, and were determined
to make me ſenſible you did ſo, by your ſilence. I hope, this error of
mine will ſerve to eſtabliſh one rule on <hi>both</hi> ſides.—It
is what ought, I am ſure, always to take place, where people wiſh a
perpetuity of friendſhip. I mean, never, upon circumſtances of
diſreſpect, to admit of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidence.</p>
            <p>I am very grave, ſo you may depend on the ſincerity of all I
ſhall ſay, I ſaw ſeveral beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in your former elegy; but though it
was 
<q rend="inline">"formoſa,"</q> it did not appear to me 
<q rend="inline">"ipſa forma."</q> I like this that you have now
ſent <hi>very</hi> much. It has a ſimplicity which your laſt a little
wanted, and has thought <hi>enough.</hi> I begin to be ſeldom pleaſed with
the compoſitions of others, or my own; but I could be really <hi>fond</hi> of
this, with a ſew alterations, that I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:—but you muſt
know, at the ſame time, <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1250901200:110"/> that theſe are ſuch as no
one would approve beſide myſelf.—I know it. However there are ſome
ſeeming <hi>faults</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>I have been greatly mortified in my correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of late.
—I even ſaid in my haſte, All friends are faithleſs.—G, after
a month's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, which he had confirmed to me, of ſeeing him here, let
me know about a fortnight ſince, that I had more leiſure than him; and
ſince it did not ſuit his convenience to come, I ought to take the
opportunity of viſiting him, and ſeeing Derbyſhire while he continues in
it.—W— has not wrote to me theſe ſix weeks.—Outing has
been, moreover, dumb for the ſame ſpace of time; and I purpoſe in my
heart to behave with ſome diſtance toward both, for this neglect (ſee my
rule of circumſtantial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence).</p>
            <p>It is a pity you cannot ſpare a day or two to come and ſee me.
My wood grows exceſſively pleaſant, and its pleaſantneſs vexes me;
becauſe nobody will come that can taſte it.</p>
            <p>Your health, according to your deſcription, is much the ſame
with mine; but from the gaiety of your ſtyle and <hi>deſigns,</hi> I
collect that it is greatly better.</p>
            <p>I have an alcove, ſix elegies, a ſeat, two epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs (one upon
myſelf), three ballads, four ſongs, and a ſerpentine river, to ſhew you
when you come. Will the compoſitions come ſafe to you, if I ſend my book,
which contains the <hi>only</hi> copies of ſeveral things (which I could not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member if they were loſt)?—but I will not ſend them. If my horſe
gets well, I may eſſay a viſit for two days, and bring them with me, that
I may make comments while you read them, as beſeemeth a genuine author to
do.</p>
            <p>I am raiſing a green-houſe from the excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Lord
Dudley's; but I do not find that <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1250901200:111"/> 
               <q rend="inline">"vient l'appetit en mangeant,"</q> that I grow
fonder of my collection proportionable as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think myſelf fortunate enough at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if, like
you, I could only find that I had been mentioned for a vacant poſt; but I
have withdrawn all my views from court-preferment, and fixed them on finding a
pot of money, which I determine to be the far more probable ſcheme.</p>
            <p>I have little health and frequent mortification, ſo that no one
need envy me; and yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there <hi>are</hi> that do Are any enviable
but ſuch as are unambitious? I never ſhall be able to reckon myſelf of
that tribe, which have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed all <hi>happineſs</hi> to themſelves,
and left the reſt of the world nothing but hopes and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Yet I do not much feel the pains of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, while I am converſing with
ingenious friends of my own level: but in <hi>other</hi> company it hurts me.
Let me adviſe you, now I think of it, to dread the company of ſilly people,
out-of-the-way people, and, in one word, what men of genius <hi>call the
vulgar.</hi> You run ten times the riſque of being mortified, voluntarily or
unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, amongſt the latter of theſe, to what you do amongſt men of

            <p>I THINK I have lived to out correſpond almoſt all my
correſpondents; whether you are the laſt that is to be ſubdued, I will
not ſay; <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1250901200:112"/> the reſt are ſo fatigued, that they are
not able to atchieve a line. Apprized of this, and being by nature diſpoſed
to have mercy on the vanquiſhed, 
<q rend="inline">"parcere ſubjectis,"</q> I ſeldom write a
ſyllable more than is requiſite to further ſome ſcheme, or aſcertain
ſome interview, the latter of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpoſe of <hi>this</hi>
mine epiſtle. I am in great hopes I ſhall be at liberty to ſee you ere
many weeks be paſt; and would beg of you, in the mean time, to inform me, by
a letter, when I am likely, or when very <hi>unlikely,</hi> to meet you at
home. I am detained, juſt at preſent, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual expectations of the
Hagley family.</p>
            <p>As I was returning from church on Sunday laſt, whom ſhould I
meet in a chaiſe, with two horſes lengthways, but that right friendly bard,
Mr. Thompſon? I complimented him upon his arrival in this country, and
aſked him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Mr. Lyttelton to The Leaſows, which he ſaid he
would with abundance of pleaſure; and ſo we parted. You will obſerve,
that the more ſtreſs I lay upon this viſit, and the more I
<hi>diſcover</hi> to you, the more ſubſtantial is my apology for
deferring mine into Warwickſhire. I own, I am pleaſed with the proſpect
of ſhewing them ſomething at The Leaſows beyond what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. I have
begun my terras on the high hill I ſhewed you, made ſome conſiderable
improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Virgil's grove, and finiſhed a walk from it to the houſe,
after a manner which you will approve. They are going to build a caſtle in
the park round the lodge, which, if well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, muſt have a good effect;
and they are going likewiſe to build a rotund to terminate the viſto. The
fault is, that they anticipate every thing which I propoſe to do when I
become <hi>rich</hi>; but as that is never likely to be, perhaps it is not of
any importance;—but what I term <hi>rich,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no great deal; I
believe, you are a witneſs to the moderation of my deſires; and I flatter 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1250901200:113"/> myſelf that you will believe your friend in
<hi>that</hi> reſpect ſomething above the vulgar.</p>

            </q>
            <p>If I come to your houſe, poſitively I will not go to ſee Mr.
M—. He has been twice as near me as The Grange, with C— L—,
and never deemed my place worth ſeeing. I doubt, you are a little too
modeſt in praiſing it wherever you go.—Why don't you applaud it with
both hands, 
<q rend="inline">"utroque pollice?"—"Parcentes ego dexteras

complain unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of you; for, as you have always contributed to my

            <p>I think I could add about half a dozen hints to your obſervations

then why will you not put it into ſome news-paper, or monthly pamphlet? you

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM tempted once more to apologize for the the unſeaſonable
viſit I paid you, though I feel myſelf entirely innocent in that reſpect,
even as much as the poſt-boy was guilty; for had my previous letter arrived
in due time, you had then been furniſhed with an opportunity of waving my
company till a more convenient ſeaſon. I was <hi>only,</hi> or, at leaſt,
<hi>chiefly</hi> uneaſy upon <hi>your</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I ſpent my time very
agreeably, and only leſs ſo than I might, had I not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to
myſelf, that I was intruding upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic tenderneſſes.</p>
            <p>I ſpent the Sunday night and the next day at Mr. Wren's; and am
now juſt returned from Mr. Dolman's, who has made me a genteel preſent of
Spence's Polymetis. I have not yet <hi>read</hi> many dialogues in it, but I
have <hi>dipped</hi> in ſeveral; and have reaſon to be well enough
ſatisfied with the ſimple and uninvidious manner in which he has introduced
Mr. Lowth's poem. I have long <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1250901200:117"/> known of this intended
<hi>introduction</hi> (which I acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally found to have to have been
ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them before I publiſhed <hi>mine</hi> on the ſame
ſubject), and a little dreaded the <hi>form</hi> of it. I have long ago made
conſiderable improvements in mine, and have a mind one day to publiſh it
once more; after which, let it ſleep in peace. I have ſometimes thought of
printing my next title-page thus, viz. 
<q rend="inline">"Poems; conſiſting of Songs, Odes, and Elegies,
with an improved edition of The Judgment of Hercules, and of The
Shool-miſtreſs."</q> But I have but very few critical acquaintance, and I
live at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from thoſe I have; ſtationed amongſt the
<hi>makers</hi> and the <hi>wearers</hi> of hob-nails; 
<q> 
                  <l>Far from the joys that with my ſoul agree,</l> 
                  <l>From <hi>wit,</hi> from <hi>learning</hi>—very far from
thee.</l> 
                  <bibl>PARNELL.</bibl>
               </q> I know I have thrown a great number of
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs things into your hands. I know to <hi>whom</hi> I intruſted my
follies; but I know <hi>not</hi> what they <hi>are:</hi>—I believe, in
general, that they conſiſt of mis-begotten embryos and abortive births,
which it had been merely decent to have buried in—ſome part of my
garden; but I was morally aſſured, that you would expoſe nothing of mine
to my diſadvantage. As to ſome that are <hi>leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</hi> you
promiſed your obſervations, and I deſire you would make them with the
utmoſt freedom. I can bear any cenſure which you ſhall paſs by way of
letter, and I beg once more that you would not be ſparing. It will be
eſteemed as great a favour as you can do me. When they have gone through your
hands, and thoſe of one or two more friends, I ſhall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, think of
publiſhing them; though as to that, much depends upon the advice I receive,
and previouſly on the opportunity I have of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1250901200:118"/> I am in hopes that you will be pretty full in diſcovering to me,
<hi>which you diſlike the leaſt, what faults you find,</hi> and <hi>what
improvements they are capable of.</hi> I ſet you a tedious taſk; but I will
return the favour as far as I am able, either in the <hi>ſame way</hi> or any
other. This brings me to ſay, that, if there be any compoſitions of yours
that you would have me to correct (and there are ſeveral of which I want a
copy), I would beg you to ſend them. Your Blackbird excels any ſinging-bird
I ever heard, and I beſeech you to convey it to The Leaſows by the next
opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that he may acquire ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

in other valleys, than thoſe in which he was produced.—I have many
compliments to make in your country; to Mr. H—, Mrs. N—, Mrs.
J—, Mr. F—, Mr. T—, and your brother. If I go over to Mr.
W—'s, I will aſſuredly call and ſpend a night with
you.—<hi>That</hi> is precarious.—But whether I do or not, I would
willingly hope to ſee you this ſpring and ſummer more than once; as a
<hi>critic</hi> and as a <hi>friend:</hi> nor do I forget the promiſe of Mr.
H— and Mr. F—;—but of theſe things more when I ſend for
the papers, which I purpoſe to do to-morrow fortnight, that is, the
twenty-ninth of February.</p>
            <p>I have ſuffered greatly by railing at the black button on a
parſon's great coat. Had Mr. Hall's been thus diſtinguiſhed, he could not
have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken mine for his own; which latter I ſent in order to be
commuted at Birmingham, and was almoſt ſtarved to death before I could
accompliſh the exchange. There is no trifling with any <hi>part</hi> of
orthodoxy with impunity.—That is the moral.</p>
            <p>I have received a very obliging letter from Lady Luxborough, wherein
ſhe tells me, that Lady Hartford admires my place in her deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mr.
Thomſon is intimate at Lady Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's; and I ſuppoſe Lady Hartford may
have <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1250901200:119"/> been informed by L. L. that Mr. Thomſon has been
here; ſo I conclude, in mere vanity, that my farm is advancing in
reputation.</p>
            <p>What think you of Mr. Carte's Hiſtory? or what of his narrative
concerning the Pretender's touching for the King's evil? I think one is not,
however, to give up his book entirely; becauſe, with <hi>all his
ſuperſtition,</hi> he may have ſeveral anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes that one would like to
read.</p>
            <p>I have had great expectations from the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful veins of a piece
of oak of which I have had a table made; but, upon a thorough ſurvey of it,
it is ſo like nothing in the world as old B—'s callimanco
night-gown..</p>
            <p>I have nothing to add worth beginning upon another page; but I
happened not to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular concluſion in my preceeding one.</p>
            <p>You muſt give me ſome time to colour you a collection of flowers
(that octavo edition I ſhewed you here); and then I will make Mrs. Jago a
preſent of it. I believe I can engage Mr. Dolman to aſſiſt me, who is
much my ſuperior in point of accuracy; and the inſcription at the beginning
is to run ſomehow thus:

garland-maker; but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription I may alter, if I can think of any thing
more expreſſive of the regard which I have ever borne and ſtill bare
you.</p>
            <p>Lord Dudley is gone, and franks are no more. I have nothing to

            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE ſent Tom over for the papers which I left under your
inſpection; have nothing to to add upon this head, but that the more
<hi>freely</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> you give me your opinion, the greater
will be the obligation which I ſhall have to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be very glad, if I happen to receive a good large bundle
of your own compoſitions; in regard to which, I will obſerve any commands
which you ſhall pleaſe to lay upon me.</p>
            <p>I am favoured with a certain correſpondence, by way of letter,
which I told you I ſhould be glad to cultivate; and I find it very
entertaining.</p>
            <p>Pray did you receive my anſwer to your laſt letter, ſent by
way of London? I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſorry to be debarred the pleaſure
of writing to you by the poſt, as often as I feel a violent propenſity to
deſcribe the notable inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of my life; which amount to about as much as
the tinſel of your little boy's hobby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe.</p>
            <p>I am on the point of purchaſing a couple of buſts for the niches
in my hall; and believe me, my good friend, I never proceed one ſtep in
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenting <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1250901200:121"/> my little farm, but I enjoy the hopes of
rendering it more agreeable to you, and the ſmall circle of acquaintance, who
ſometimes favour me with their company.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be extremely glad to ſee you and Mr. Fancourt when the
trees are green; that is, in May; but I would not have you content your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with a ſingle viſit this ſummer. If Mr. Hardy (to whom you will make my
compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) inclines to favour me ſo far, you muſt calculate ſo as to
wait on him whenever he finds it convenient; though I have <hi>better
hopes</hi> of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reception here agreeable to him when my Lord Dudley
comes down.—I wonder how he would like the ſcheme I am upon, of
exchanging a large tankard for a ſilver ſtandiſh.</p>
            <p>I have had a couple of paintings given me ſince you were here. One
of them is a Madona, valued, as it is ſaid, at ten guineas in Italy, but
which you would hardly purchaſe at the price of five ſhillings. However, I
am endeavouring to make it out to be one of Carlo Maratt's, who was a firſt
hand, and famous for Madonas; even ſo as to be nick-named 
<q rend="inline">"Cartuccio delle Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne"</q> by Salvator Roſa.
Two letters of the cypher (CM) agree; what ſhall I do with regard to the
third? It is a ſmall piece, and ſadly black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. It is about the ſize
(though not quite the ſhape) of the Bacchus over the parlour door, and has
much ſuch a frame.</p>
            <p>A perſon may amuſe himſelf almoſt as cheaply as he
pleaſes. I find no ſmall delight in rearing all ſorts of poultry;
geeſe, turkeys, pullets, ducks, &amp;c. I am alſo ſomewhat ſmitten with
a blackbird which I have purchaſed: a very ſine one; brother by father, but
not by mother, to the unfortunate bird you ſo beautifully deſcribe, a copy
of which deſcription you muſt not fail to ſend me;—but, as I ſaid
before, one may eaſily habituate one's ſelf to cheap amuſements; that 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1250901200:122"/> is, <hi>rural</hi> ones (for all town amuſements are
hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly expenſive);—I would have you cultivate your garden; plant
flowers, have a bird or two in the hall (they will at <hi>leaſt</hi> amuſe
your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren); write now and then a ſong; buy now and then a book; write
now and then a letter to</p>

               </q> I would have you acquire, if poſſible, what the world
calls, with ſome <hi>propriety,</hi> an <hi>eaſy</hi> fortune; and what I
interpret, ſuch a fortune as allows of ſome inaccuracy and inattention,
that one may not be continually in ſuſpence about the laying out a

that I never <hi>acted</hi> as I ſay. I have loſt <hi>my</hi> road to
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, I confeſs; and, inſtead of purſuing the way to the fine
lawns, and venerable oaks, which diſtinguiſh the region of it, I am got
into the pitiful parterre-garden of amuſement, and view the nobler ſcenes
at a <hi>diſtance.</hi> I think I can ſee the <hi>road</hi> too that
<hi>leads</hi> the better way, and can ſhew it others; but I have many miles
to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure back before I can get into it myſelf, and no kind of reſolution
to take a ſingle ſtep. My chief amuſements at preſent are the ſame
they have long been, and lie ſcattered about my farm. The French have what
they call a <hi>parque ornée;</hi> I ſuppoſe, approaching about as
near to a garden as the park at Hagley. I give my place the title of a
<hi>ferme ornée;</hi> though, if I had money, I ſhould hardly confine
myſelf to ſuch decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as that name requires. I have made great
improvements; and the <hi>conſequence</hi> is, that I long to have you ſee

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1250901200:124"/>I have not heard whether Miſs—'s match

            </opener>
            <p>I HARDLY know whether it will be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in me to own, that I wrote
you a <hi>long letter</hi> upon the receipt of your laſt, which I now have
upon my table. I condemn this habit in <hi>myſelf</hi> entirely, and
ſhould, I am ſure, be very unhappy, if my friends, by my example, ſhould
be induced to contract the ſame. The truth is, I had not expreſſed
myſelf in it to my mind, and it was full of blots and blunders, and
interlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; yet, ſuch as it was, it had wearied my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and given
me a diſinclination to begin it a freſh. I am now impatient to remove any
ſcruple you may have concerning my grateful ſenſe of all your favours,
and the invariable continuance of my affection and eſteem—I find by
your laſt obliging letter, that my machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and devices are not entirely
private.—You knew of my draught of Hagley Caſtle about the bigneſs of
a barley-corn; you knew of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended viſit to Lady Luxborough's; and I
muſt add, Mr. Thomas Hall knew of my contrivance for the embelliſhment of
Mr. Hardy's houſe. Nothing is there hid that ſhall not be
revealed.—Our viſit to Barrels is now over and pad.—Lady
Luxborough has ſeen Hagley Caſtle in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:—and as to my
deſire that my draught might be ſhewn to no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſoul,
you ſurely did but ill with it, when you ſhewed that <hi>drawing</hi> to a 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1250901200:126"/> 
               <hi>Clergyman.</hi> However, you may have acted up to my
<hi>real</hi> meaning, if you have taken care not to ſhew it to any
connoiſſeur. I meant chiefly to guard againſt any one that knows the
rules, in whoſe eyes, I am ſure, it would not turn to my credit.—Pray
how do you like the feſtoons dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over the oval windows?—It is the
chief advantage in repairing an old houſe, that one may deviate from the
rules without any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary cenſure.</p>
            <p>I will not trouble you <hi>now</hi> with many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. The
intent of Tom's coming is, to deſire your company and Mrs. Jago's this
week.—I ſhould be extremely glad if your convenience would allow you to
come on Monday or Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; but, if it is <hi>entirely</hi> impracticable, I
would beſeech you not to put off the viſit longer than the Monday
following, for the leaves of my groves begin to fall a great pace. I beg once
more, you would let no ſmall inconvenience prevent your being here on
Monday.—As to my viſit at Icheneton, you may depend upon it ſoon
after; and I hope you will not ſtand upon punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilio, when I mention my
inclination that you may all take a walk through my coppices before their
beauty is much impaired. Were I in a ſprightly vein, I would aim at ſaying

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1250901200:127"/>I thank you very <hi>ſenſibly</hi> for
the verſes with which you honour me. I think them good lines, and ſo do
others that have ſeen them; but you will give me leave, when I ſee you, to
propoſe ſome little alteration. As to an epiſtle, it would be executed
with <hi>difficulty,</hi> and I would have it turn to your credit as well as my
own. But you have certainly of late acquired an <hi>caſe</hi> in writing; and
I am tempted to think, that what you write henceforth will be univerſally
good. Perſons that have ſeen your elegies like 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>The Blackbirds</hi>"</q> beſt, as it is
moſt aſſuredly the moſt <hi>correct</hi>: but I, who pretend to great
penetration, can foreſee that 
<q rend="inline">"The Linnets"</q> 
                  <hi>will</hi> be made to
excel.—More of this when I ſee you. Poor Miſs G—, J—

<hi>dead.</hi>—He was to have been at Hagley this week, and then I
ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have ſeen him <hi>here</hi>—As it is, I will erect
an urn in Virgil's Grove to his memory.—I was really as much ſhocked to
hear of his death, as if I had known and loved him for a number of
years:—God knows, I lean on a very few friends; and if they drop me, I
become a wretched mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanthrope.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I TAKE this opportunity of acknowledging the juſtice of your
excuſes. Mrs. Jago's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ſtances render her viſit quite imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, and yours I have
the ſame kind of reaſon to diſpenſe with; as I gueſs, that ſhe
could as ſoon take a journey <hi>herſelf</hi> at this time, as bear that
<hi>you</hi> ſhould.—But to ſay I was not greatly 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1250901200:128"/> mortified, would be doing myſelf the greateſt
injuſtice. <hi>Diſappointed</hi> I was, you may be ſure, to hear
excuſes; even as much as Sir John Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, when Mr. Dombledon put him in
mind of <hi>ſecurity,</hi> inſtead of ſending him <hi>two</hi> and
<hi>thirty yards</hi> of ſattin to make him a <hi>ſhort</hi> cloak. And on
the whole, I began to accuſe you and Mrs. Jago of <hi>colloguing</hi>
together, to fix your viſit at a time when you were well aſſured you
ſhould have an <hi>apology</hi> to ſend me inſtead. Now, if I ſhould
preſs this accuſation, pray how would you evade the force of it?—The
next thing I am to ſpeak to, is your verſes. I have made you my
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments <hi>before</hi>; and as you are ſo good as to accept them, I
will not trouble you with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional profeſſions, or repetitions of the
paſt. I will depend upon your good-ſenſe for an excuſe, if I only add
what I think proper as to any <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi> wherein I have a view to
<hi>your</hi> credit, as my <hi>own.</hi> I confeſs, it requires ſome
nicety to inſcribe ſuch an elegy as The Gold-finches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the danger
you foreſaw. But I think it <hi>may</hi> be done (and <hi>is</hi> pretty
nearly) in ſuch manner as no man of <hi>taſte</hi> will be tempted to
ridicule it; and as for the vulgar, of whatever <hi>rank</hi> they be, it is
abſolutely neceſſary many times to <hi>give them up. Taſte</hi> and
<hi>tenderneſs</hi> are abſolutely connected; and you may very readily call
to mind ſome charming things, that muſt excite the laughter of your men of
<hi>fire</hi> and <hi>banter,</hi> but are by no means thought the worſe of
by men of <hi>true genius.</hi> I will only mention Andrew Marvel's
<hi>Fawn</hi> in Dryden's Miſcellanies. I incloſe the elegy with ſome few
propoſed alterations, ſo I will not riſque the <hi>ſilling</hi> my
<hi>letter</hi> with criticiſm. I alſo incloſe the other verſes you
ſent me, which I think good ones, and to ſtand in need of little
alteration, beſide that of the inglorious name at the head of them; to which,
notwithſtanding, I will never ſubmit. Pray who is the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1250901200:129"/> that tranſlates your elegy into Latin?—The new
dreſs will give you ſome amuſement; and, if theſe lines <hi>be</hi> the
product of the genius of a boy of that age, he will in a year's time be able to
extend the ſame of your compoſitions. I ſhall then be glad to ſee the
Gold finches under his hand; though I have no extraordinary fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the
Latin poetry of a modern; at leaſt, till your eldeſt ſon begins to
tranſlate our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigals.</p>
            <p>I have not yet ſeen Mr. Thomſon's Caſtle of Indolence.—I
waited for a ſmaller edition; but am now too impatient not to ſend for it
on Thurſday next.—I am fully bent on raiſing a neat urn to him in my
lower grove, if Mr. Lyttelton does not inſcribe one at Hagley <hi>before</hi>
me. But I ſhould be extremely glad of your advice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts to place
it.—You ſpeak of my dwelling in the Caſtle of Indolence, and I verily
believe I <hi>do.</hi> There is ſomething like enchantment in my preſent
inactivity; for, without any kind of lett or impediment to the correction of my
trifles that I ſee, I am in no wiſe able to make the leaft advances. I
think within myſelf I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed if you were here; and yet I have
reaſon to believe, if you <hi>were</hi> here, we ſhould only ramble round
the groves, and chat away the time; and perhaps <hi>that,</hi> upon the
<hi>whole,</hi> is of full as much importance.—I do not know but I do
myſelf ſome little injuſtice here, for I <hi>have</hi> wrote out my
<hi>levities,</hi> and my <hi>ſonnets,</hi> good and bad, with many ornaments
from the pencil; and the next thing I do will be to tranſcribe my elegies.
The fault is, I take no pains to <hi>improve</hi> what I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and,
conſequently, am only able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit my nonſenſe in a fairer
dreſs.—You muſt give me leave, ere it be long, to inſert two or
three lines (I think in <hi>verſe</hi>) before Mrs. Jago's
flower-piece.—I am ſure, I am obliged to her for a fruit I greatly
love.—It was not entirely ripe; <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1250901200:130"/> but it was the
only one I have taſted ſince I was laſt in London.—Yeſterday
dined here Lady Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Mr. Outing and Mr. Hall, Lord Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Miſs Lea,
Counſellor Corbet and Mr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Mr. Perry, Mrs. Perry and Miſs Dolman,
and half a dozen footmen beſide my own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and labourers; ſo you
may gueſs we had no ſmall fracas. I now ſit down amid ſolitude and
ſilence, and can hear little elſe beſide the pendulum of my
clock;—yet my ſpirits are no way ſunk, but afford me juſt ſuch a
temperature of mind as inclines me to write to ſome familiar friend: albeit I
have a thouſand things to <hi>talk</hi> of to you, which I do not care to
<hi>write.</hi> I hope to be able to ſpend a few days with Mr. Hardy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his melons are all gone; and yet I would not have him keep one a
<hi>moment</hi> longer upon <hi>my</hi> account. I deſire he would accept of
my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as I truſt he will.—Franks at preſent run low with
me; but I ſend you <hi>one,</hi> which you cannot uſe ſo ſoon but I
ſhall be able to ſend you others immediately. I wiſh I could ſend you
any thing more than the means of obliging,</p>

            <p>I MUST fairly own, that I have not ſate down till now to return my
acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for your laſt moſt obliging favour; and yet I have been
doing ſo in <hi>imagination</hi> almoſt every day ſince I received it. I
have only to deſire <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1250901200:131"/> that you would not think me
<hi>ſtupid</hi>; and then you muſt of courſe conclude me highly
delighted, to find the verſes which had ſo greatly pleaſed me, made ſo
<hi>particularly intereſting</hi> to me. In teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony hereof, I have
cauſed theſe my letters to be made <hi>patent,</hi> &amp;c. Furthermore, I
am glad to ſee you diſſent from ſome alterations I propoſed, for
which, generally ſpeaking, I think I can ſee your reaſons. As to any
little matter which I have to mention farther, I chuſe to defer it till I
wait on Mr. Hardy; which I purpoſe to do before this month is out. It may
poſſibly <hi>happen</hi> the beginning of the next week; but I dare not lay
ſuch ſtreſs upon a future <hi>event,</hi> as to give you a commiſſion
to ſay ſo much to <hi>him.</hi> Inſtead thereof pleaſe to make him my
compliments, and tell him I talk of coming <hi>very ſoon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I borrowed Dodſley's Miſcellany of Lady Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, in which
are many good things. I long to be making a mark on the head of every copy (as
I would do were the books my <hi>own</hi>). Here a cypher; there an
aſteriſm of five points, and there one of eight.—If you, and Mr.
W—, and Mr. G—, and I, were together for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, to correct
and reviſe, might not we make a miſcellany of <hi>originals</hi> that would
ſell?—My fingers itch to be at it;—but I fear it cannot
be.—Thomſon's poem amuſed me greatly.—I think his plan has
faults; particularly, that he ſhould have ſaid nothing of the diſeaſes
attending lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his <hi>firſt</hi> canto, but reſerved them to
ſtrike us <hi>more affectingly</hi> in the laſt; but, on the whole, who
would have thought that Thomſon could have ſo well imitated a perſon
remarkable for ſimplicity both of ſentiment and phraſe?</p>
            <p>I ſtudy no connections in a letter; and ſo I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to tell
you, that I have got a machine to exhibit landſcapes, &amp;c. to advantage.
It coſts about fourteen ſhillings, and I recommend one to you or Mr.
Hardy.—Smith's Views (with a <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1250901200:132"/> little colouring)
appear raviſhingly;—but if you are not content with
<hi>amuſement,</hi> and want <hi>fame</hi> (which differs about as much as
<hi>fox</hi>-hunting from <hi>hare</hi>-hunting), you muſt
<hi>print.</hi>—However, if you can acquieſce in a <hi>limited
reputation,</hi> to give you a proper weight at all your viſiting-places
(which I think enough for all reaſonable ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes), take the

            <p>FIE on Mr. N—! he has diſappointed me of the moſt

bloſſom, my walks newly cleaned, my neighbours invited, and I languiſhing
for lack of your company! Mean time you are going to dance attendance on a
courtier.—Would to God! he may diſappoint <hi>you,</hi> according to

probably do ſomething for you one time or other; but you ſhall never go

            <p>IT is now Sunday evening, and I have been exhibiting myſelf in my
walks to no leſs than a hundred and fifty people, and that with no leſs
ſtate and vanity than a Turk in his ſeraglio.—I have <hi>ſome</hi>
hopes of ſeeing you <hi>this</hi> week; but if theſe ſhould happen to be
fruſtrated, I ſhall find them revive with double ardour and vivacity the
next. Did you tell me of a treatiſe that your <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1250901200:138"/> Mr.
Millar had, where the author endeavours to vindicate and eſtabliſh Gothic
architecture? and does not the ſame man explain it alſo by draughts on
copper plates? That very book, or rather the title, and the author's name, I
want.—I ſhall never, I believe, be entirely partial to Goths or Vandals
either; but I think, by the aſſiſtance of ſome ſuch treatiſe, I
could ſketch out ſome charming Gothic temples and Gothic benches for garden
ſeats.—I do alſo eſteem it extremely ridiculous to permit another
perſon to deſign <hi>for</hi> you, when by ſketching out your own plans
you <hi>appropriate</hi> the merit of all you build, and feel a double
pleaſure from any praiſes which it receives.—I had here laſt
Wedneſday Dean Lyttelton, Mr. William Lyttelton, Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modore Weſt, Miſs
Lyttelton and Miſs Weſt. They drank tea, and went round my walks, where
they ſeemed aſtoniſhed they had been ſo long ignorant of the beauties
of the place; ſaid, in general, every thing that was <hi>complaiſant</hi>
or <hi>friendly</hi>; and left me highly delighted with <hi>their</hi> viſit,
and with room to hope for many more. Mean time, why do not <hi>you</hi> come? I
<hi>do</hi> ſay you are not Pylades.—What! you think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you
have an agreeable wife, and five fine children, that you muſt employ all your
time in careſſing them at home, or laying ſchemes for their emolument
abroad? Is this public ſpirit? is this virtue? or, if it be virtue, doſt

Northumberland-houſe; nine houſes to be purchaſed and pulled down on
the other ſide the Strand for ſtables; the Strand there to be widened: I

            </opener>
            <p>THOUGH I have not hitherto troubled you with a letter, I have not
been void either of <hi>inquiry</hi> or <hi>information,</hi> concerning the
ſtate of your affairs, and of Mr. Hardy's health. Indeed it is now ſeveral
weeks ſince I collected ſome particulars from your brother, and I am now
impatient for further intelligence. As to the circumſtances of our friendly
reception at Wroxall, Mr. John Jago has probably enough acquainted you with
them. He <hi>would,</hi> however, ſeduce me to give you a diſtinct account;
being <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1250901200:142"/> aſſured, as he ſays, that Mr. Wren's
behaviour muſt afford a good ſubject for drollery. I do not know how far
this would be proper; but I think, when I write again to my friend Wren, to
give him a ſketch of his own character, juſt as it appeared to us during
the time of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. Perhaps it may avail a little. Amidſt his violent
paſſion for gardening, if he would but prune away ſome wild
excreſcences from one or two branches of his character, he might bring
himſelf to bear good fruit. He ſhould <hi>weed</hi> his <hi>mind</hi> a
little; where there has ſprung up a moſt luxuriant crop of puns, that
threaten to choak all its wholeſome productions. 
<q rend="inline">"Spinas animo fortius quam agro evellat."</q> He has
good ſenſe and good-nature; pity he ſhould diſguiſe them.—Not
but that it is better to have the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> alone than the
<hi>forms alone,</hi> and ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. Since I came home, I have done
little elſe than plant buſhes, hazel hawthorn, crabtree, elder, &amp;c.
together with ſome flowering ſhrubs that I have had given me, and ſome
that I have purchaſed to the amount of twenty ſhillings. I think nothing
remarkable has occurred; only, one miſerable tempeſtuous day, I had my Lord
Stamford, who called to ſee my walks. My Lord promiſed to come again in the
ſummer, and invited me more than once to Enville. By the way, he is now
building a Gothic green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe by Mr. Miller's direction, and intends to build
caſtles, and God-knows-what. By all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the place is well worth
ſeeing when you come in to the country, which I hope you will not fail to do
this ſpring. Pray do not you embroil me with Mr. Miller, in regard to
<hi>any</hi> obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I made in his walks. Remember there were a great
many things with which I was highly delighted; and forget that there were a few
alſo which I ſeemed leſs to admire. Indeed, I thought it idle to regulate
my expreſſions, amongſt friends only, by the ſame rules which 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1250901200:143"/> I ought to obſerve in mixed company. I ſay
<hi>ought,</hi> for <hi>he</hi> has been exceedingly favourable to <hi>me</hi>
in his repreſentation of the Leaſows.—I hope to ſee Mr. Fancourt
with you, when you come this ſpring; and why not your brother? he can ſpend
half a week every now and then at Wroxal.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to <hi>inſert</hi> or <hi>incloſe</hi> in this
letter that can render it at all agreeable.—I cannot <hi>write,</hi> I
cannot <hi>think.</hi> I can juſt muſter up atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to give
orders to my workmen; I ſaunter about my grounds, take ſnuff, and read
Clariſſa. This laſt part of my employment threatens to grow extremely
<hi>tedious:</hi> not but the author is a man of <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>nice
obſervation</hi>; but he might be leſs <hi>prolix.</hi> I will ſend you 
<q rend="inline">"The Life of Socrates"</q> when I can get it home
from Barrels. I wiſh both your circumſtances and mine would allow of an
utter <hi>inattention</hi> to them; and then, I believe, our natural indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
would be a kind of match for our ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall probably enlarge my
acquaintance this year; but what <hi>doth</hi> it? the circle of my friends
with whom I can be <hi>eaſy,</hi> and <hi>amuſed</hi> much, will continue
ſmall as ever. I could dwell a good deal upon this ſubject; but I have only
room to deſire you would give me your opinion how I ſhould inſcribe my
urn to Mr. Somerville. 
<q rend="inline">"Author of the Chace"</q> cannot be tolerably

            </opener>
            <p>I ACKNOWLEDGE myſelf obliged to you for procuring me the pictures.
I received them both very ſafe, as I have a pretty ſtrong aſſurance I
<hi>ſhall</hi> do moſt articles of which my ſervant Tom has the
care.—He has punctuality and management to <hi>alone</hi> for his
<hi>imperfections.</hi> He brought me theſe paper-ſculled buſts from
Wroxall entirely unhurt, contrary to the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all that ſaw them;
after which, he might undertake for almoſt any thing.—The por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait is
undoubtedly a good one. I ſhewed it to Mr. Smart (who is a painter himſelf,
though a clergyman), and he allowed as much; added alſo, that it had
ſomething of Sir Godfrey Knel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as well as of Sir Peter Lely.—The
flower-piece is very good, ſo far as relates to the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; the dog and
parrot abominable, and the grapes very exceptionable. I never conſider the
two flower-pieces at Icheneton with attention enough to cauſe a preference;
having never any thoughts that <hi>either</hi> would fall to my ſhare. I
ſhall add nothing with regard to your choice; but that I ſincerely
<hi>hope</hi> yours is the better piece. I never heard of Caſteels, I own;
nor can I find his name in any of my accounts of the painters, though they take
in pretty modern ones: but I can ſay this for your comfort, that if he
excelled in any thing, it was probably in flowers; for I ſee his name at the
bottom of thoſe flower-pieces that I have in water colours, as the deſigner
of them; and I think the deſigns are good. Though I could wiſh neither the
Cupid nor the fruit-piece had eſcaped us, yet is there no blame to be laid at
your door; at leaſt ſuppoſing <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1250901200:145"/> that you are endowed
with nothing more than rational conjecture, and that you are not gifted with
prophecy.</p>
            <p>And now, having ſpoken, I think, to <hi>moſt</hi> parts of your
letter, I proceed to ſay a word or two in the way of appendix. Firſt then,
after five or ſix weeks work of maſons and carpenters, I plainly diſcover
that my houſe is an unfiniſhable thing;—and yet, I perſuade
myſelf, there will never be wanting a room in it, where you may ſpend an
agreeable day with your undoubted friend.—Did I ever tell you how
<hi>unſeaſonably</hi> the three fiddles ſtruck up in my grove about an
hour after you left me; and how a ſet of ten bells was heard from my wood the
evening after? It might have paſſed for the harmony of ſome aerial
ſpirit, who was a well-wiſher to us poor mortals; but that I think, had it
been ſo, it would have been addreſſed to the <hi>better ſort,</hi> and
of conſequence have been heard whilſt <hi>you</hi> were <hi>here.</hi> This
by way of introduction to what I am going to tell you. Mr. Pixell has made an
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his club at Birmingham, to give me a day's muſic in ſome
part of my walks. The time is not yet fixed: but, if you were an idle man, and
could be brought over at a day or two's notice, I would give it you, and be in
hopes I could entertain you very agreeably.</p>
            <p>You cannot think how much you gratified my vanity when you were
here, by ſaying that if this place were yours, you thought you ſhould be
leſs able to keep within the bounds of <hi>aeconomy</hi> than
myſelf.—God knows, it is pain and grief to me to obſerve her rules at
<hi>all;</hi> and <hi>rigidly</hi> I never can.—How is it poſſible to
poſſeſs improveable ſcenes, and not wiſh to improve them? and how is
it poſſible, with oeconomy, to be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of improving them upon my
fortune? To be continually in fear of exceſs in perfecting every trifling
deſign, how irkſome! to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1250901200:146"/> from
attempting <hi>any,</hi> how vexatious! ſo that I never can enjoy my
ſituation—that is certain.—Oeconomy, that invidious old matron!
on occaſion of ever frivolous expence, makes ſuch a helliſh ſqualling,
that the murmur of a caſcade is utterly loſt to me.—Often do I cry
out with Cowley, 
<q> 
                  <l>O rivers! brooks! when, when in <hi>you,</hi> ſhall I</l>

            <p>PRAY, is lazineſs an excuſe for not writing? Tell
me.—However, if it be ſo, I am afraid I ſhall want an excuſe for
lazineſs, like the philoſopher, who, ſuppoſing the world might reſt
upon a tortoiſe's back, found himſelf no leſs embarraſſed for a
pedeſtal to ſupport his tortoiſe. I have indeed been pretty buſy at
home, in raiſing a pool-dam, and have interchanged a few viſits with ſuch
of my acquaintance as live within three miles.—What then?—I
abominate all excuſes that are grounded upon the buſineſs 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1250901200:147"/> or amuſements of an idle man.—As if ſuch a
perſon's time was ſo wholly filled up, that he could not find half an hour
to write a line to his friend. It is beſt to acknowledge lazineſs at
firſt, and that there are particular intervals, when one is much leſs
diſpoſed to write even a ſew lines, than at others. And then, as to
lazineſs, one has nothing to do but to plead human frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which, if a
perſon has not too many frailties beſides, may perhaps be indulged him.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 
<q rend="inline">"Veniam petimuſque, damuſque,"</q> will not fail
to weigh with every good-natured man. The chief dealing I have with Harris the
Jew is, for the intelligence which he brings me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you and Mrs.
W—; but it ſeldom amounts to much more than that you are well, and in
your garden.</p>
            <p>He is an Ebrew Jew, or he would tell me you had purchaſed a couple
of genteel horſes, or a chaiſe and pair, and were coming over to The
Leaſows to ſpend a week with me.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I hope to ſee you ſoon; but <hi>en
paſſant</hi> I aſſure you, I ſhall go in about a month to Mr. Jago's,
and from thence to Mr. Miller's; who, I believe I told you, was here, with Mr.
Lyttelton, Lady Ayleſbury, Colonel Conway, &amp;c. I think I never anſwered
your query con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Colonel Lyttelton.—He is the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that
you remember, and your prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him has been literally
accompliſhed. He is a man of courage, genius, generoſity, and
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs; has been fortunate in the world; was made a Colonel at about
ſix and twenty; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf in ſeveral campaigns; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Dutcheſs of Bridgewater; and had the other day about ſixteen thouſand
pounds leſt him by Colonel Jefferies, a very diſtant relation. He has a
ſeat, and ſpeaks in the Houſe of Commons, has bought a town and
country-houſe; the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern way. 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1250901200:148"/> His Dutcheſs the moſt unceremonious even-tempered
woman that lives.—So enjoy the ſpirit of prophecy, and exert it
again.—It needs little more than good ſenſe.—Which of the
hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is it, that foretold in his hiſtory a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſeries
of events, by dint of this alone, and which were all accompliſhed? Let me
know what you are doing now. Have you repaired the farm-houſe you talked
of?—and have you remembered to make the man a couple of good large niches
in his chimney corner, where he, and his family, may ſpend a more comfortable
evening than was ever ſpent by any firſt miniſter in
Chriſtendom;—perhaps alſo converſe more to the purpoſe. You tell
me nothing of your Mr. Jago, Seignior Benedict, the new married man. Tell him
to leave his wife and family for a day or two, ſaddle his mule, and come to
The Leaſows.—Tell him, all pleaſures are heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a little

            <p>WITH the utmoſt gratitude for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which you ſent
me, and with the higheſt opinion of their propriety in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, do I ſit
down to anſwer your obliging let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You will not take it amiſs, I know,
if I ſcrible broken hints, and trace out little ſketches of my mind, juſt
as I ſhould go near to explain it if I were upon the ſpot, as often as I
think of you, which I beg leave to aſſure you happens many times in a day.
They ſay, 
<q rend="inline">"A word to the wiſe is enough;"</q> a word,
therefore, to a friend of underſtanding may be ſuppoſed to be ſomething
more than enough, becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he is acquainted with three parts
of one's mind before.—The cenſure you have paſſed upon Milton's
Lycidas, ſo far as it regards the metre which he has choſen, is
unexceptionably juſt; and one would imagine, if that argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the
diſtance of the rhimes were preſſed home in a public eſſay, it should
be ſufficient to extirpate that kind of verſe for ever. As to my opinion
concerning the choice of Engliſh metre <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1250901200:151"/> I dare not
touch upon the ſubject, and I will give you my reaſon: I began upon it in a
letter which I intended for you about a month ago; and I ſoon found that I
had filled a ſheet of paper with my diſſertation, and left no room for
other things which I had more mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. Beſide, I ſound it ſo
blotted that I did not chuſe to ſend it; and as the ſubject is ſo
extremely copious, I ſhall decline it entirely, till <hi>talking</hi> may
prove as effectual as <hi>writing.</hi>—As to your advice, with regard to
my publications, I believe it to be juſt, and ſhall, in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
purſue it.—I am afraid, by your account, that Dodſley has publiſhed
my name to the School-miſtreſs. I was a good deal diſpleaſed at his
publiſhing that poem without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when he had ſo many
opportunities of giving me ſome previous information; but, as he would
probably diſregard my reſentment, I choſe to ſtifle it, and wrote to
him directly upon the receipt of yours, that I would be glad to furniſh him
with an improved copy of the School miſtreſs, &amp;c. for his ſecond
edition. He accepts it with ſome complaiſance, deſires it ſoon; and I
am at a fault to have the opinion of my friends, what alterations or additions
it will be proper to inſert. I have ſcribled a copy, which I ſend this
day to Mr. Graves and Mr. Whiſtler; but I am greatly fearful I ſhall not
receive their criticiſms time enough, and I ſhall have the ſame longing
for yours. A journey to Whitchurch, which I have long propoſed, might unite
all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and I heartily wiſh I may be able to effect it
without inconvenience. If I go thither, I call on you.</p>

            <p>WHAT a ſtupid fool was I, to ſhew you thoſe letters of my
friend Graves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declares himſelf ſo freely againſt a regular
correſpondence! ſee the effects of it! You have taken immediate advantage
of his example, and I muſt never more expect an anſwer to any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that
I ſend you, in leſs than half a century. I wrote to you after I came home,
to thank you for all your kindneſs at I—, &amp;c. but not a ſyllable
have I been able to receive from you, or a word that I could hear concerning
you. I could, however, very eaſily convince you, that Mr. Graves (your
precedent) is not altogether ſo hardened an offender as you may imagine. His
laſt letter is a very affectionate recantation. I incloſe that part of it
which regards Mr. F—.</p>
            <p>What a number of ſchemes are irreparably broken by the ſudden
death of the Prince of Wales! Yours, my good friend, which ſeems to be
deſtroyed amongſt the reſt, has, I think, of late given you no
ſolicitude. Your intereſt in Mr. N— will remain the ſame, I
ſuppoſe; and if he would but ſerve you nearer <hi>home,</hi> I will have
no ſort of quarrel with him that he did not tranſplant you into
Cornwall.—It is at leaſt ſome gratification to a perſon's ſelf
love, when one finds the more <hi>ambitious</hi> hopes of more
<hi>aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> people as liable to be ſuddenly extinguiſhed as one's
own. However, the death of the Prince gave me a good deal of concern, though it
no way affected my <hi>particular</hi> intereſt, as he had all the humane,
affable, and generous qualities, which could recommend him to one's
<hi>affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Graves has ſent me two copies of verſes. One on Medals, to
Mr. Walker; and the other, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1250901200:153"/> on the late Memoirs of the
London Heroines, Lady V—, Mrs. Pilkington, and Mrs. Phillips. Both good
in their way, which you ſhall ſee when you come over.</p>
            <p>Have you ſeen the firſt books of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleriad, by Mr
Cambridge?—The Verſes written in a Country Church-yard?—Mr. W.
Whitehead's Ode to the Nymph of Briſtol Spring?—or, what <hi>have</hi>
you ſeen?—You live infinitely more in the world than I do; who hear
nothing, ſee nothing, do nothing, and <hi>am</hi> nothing. Remedy this
unhappineſs, by ſending me ſomewhat that may rouſe my
attention.—I muſt except what I hear from my Lady Luxbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, who
indulges me now and then with a letter in French.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould think this letter more than uſually <hi>dull,</hi>
you muſt know, that, ſince I ſaw you, I have been <hi>generally</hi>
diſpirited; till about a fortnight ago I found ſome nervous diſorders
that I greatly diſliked, and upon examination was told I had a nervous fever.
For this I have been taking ſaline draughts and bolus's, and <hi>hope</hi> I
am ſomething better; though I am far from well. I would not indeed have
written to you at this time, but I choſe not to defer ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
incloſed poſtſcript.—You, who have ſhared many of my
<hi>happieſt</hi> hours, will excuſe the produce of a more than ordinary
dull one.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE I received your letter, I have been a week at W—. I
believe I may have told you, that I never was fond of that place. There is too
much trivial elegance, too much punctilio for me; and perhaps, as you expreſs
it, too much <hi>ſpeculation.</hi> But I was fearful I might entirely loſe
Mr. Whiſtler's acquaintance, if I did not make an effort once in five years
to return his viſit. Beſides, I ſhould have had no hopes of ſeeing him
at The Leaſows hereafter; and I am extremely deſirous of ſeeing both
<hi>him</hi> and <hi>you</hi> here, having made many alterations which I do not
undertake but with an eye to the approbation of my more generous friends; but
he ſeems, to my great ſurprize, to renounce the thing called
<hi>taſte</hi> in buildings, gardens, &amp;c. is grown weary of his own
little embelliſhments at W—, and longs to ſettle in London for the
greater part of his time. This, I believe, he would put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
immediately; but that he thinks it might give ſome uneaſineſs to his
mother, if he ſhould quit the houſe that ſhe with ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1250901200:155"/> obtained for him. <hi>I</hi> too am ſick of the word
<hi>taſte</hi>; but I think the <hi>thing</hi> itſelf the only proper
<hi>ambition,</hi> and the <hi>ſpecific pleaſure</hi> of all who have any
ſhare in the faculty of imagination. I need not mention my reaſons; you
will ſoon conceive them. And, however the caſe be, there is one branch of
it which ſo totally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſes the perſons with whom I principally
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that I was aſtoniſhed to hear him ſpeak even with
indifference concerning the reigning taſte for rural decorations. I could ill
forbear telling Mr. Whiſtler, that he was now <hi>literally</hi> a beau in a
band-box; but the freedom might have given more offence than the joke was
worth. He has improved the place extremely; but I do not like his colonnades.
You know, nothing of that kind is tolerable, unleſs regularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in
ſtone: that is one thing. Another is, that colonnades are ornaments which
will not <hi>bear</hi> to be very <hi>diminutive.</hi> Mr. — (whoſe
houſe only I ſaw) has been at the expence of a large cornice round it, in
moſt elaborate brick-work; but with regard to his ſtucco-work
<hi>within</hi> doors, he is quite <hi>extravagant.</hi>—I mention
theſe things upon a ſuppoſition that you may like to hear <hi>any</hi>
thing that regards the place; but indeed they are ſo mighty trifling, that I
ought to doubt my ſuppoſition. I ſupped with Mr. P—'s family once
at Mr. W—'s, and all was mighty well; only I happen to have a violent
averſion to card-playing, and at W— I think they do nothing
<hi>elſe.</hi> So that, on account of my ignorance at qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drille, or any
creditable game, I was forced to loſe my money, and two evenings out of my
ſeven, at Pope Joan with Mr. P—'s children. Mr. W—, to make me
amends, invited me to breakfaſt, and ſhewed me your verſes. I aſſure
you, you have no occaſion for a better advocate than Mr. W—; whether
with regard to his <hi>judgement,</hi> or his zeal in behalf of the ſubject, 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1250901200:156"/> the verſes or the poet. I would fain have obtained a
copy; but he did not care to give one without your commiſſion. I hope
<hi>you</hi> will oblige me ſo far. I like them very much; the ſubject is
genteel, and the verſes eaſy and elegant. We agreed upon one or two
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent readings; and one ſtanza that concerns cards ſhould, I think, be
corrected. Not that I would have you leſs ſevere upon cards nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I was
even glad to find, that you g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve
them ſo little quarter. I ſometimes thought that Mr. W—'s ſeeming
fondneſs for them was a kind of <hi>contre-caeur.</hi>—Be that as it
will, his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the ſtanza, as well as mine, was ſolely founded on
the verſification, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the
ſentiment. I liked his Latin verſes; but they do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with
your's. Send me a copy, and confine my uſe of it by what limitations you
pleaſe. My reigning toy at preſent is a pocket-book; and I glory as much in
furniſhing it with the verſes of my acquaintance, as others would with
bank-bills. I did not know when I went to W—, but I might have heard Mrs.
G— <hi>accuſed of certain queſtions touching their law</hi> (I mean
of forms and ceremonies); but I did <hi>not.</hi> On the contrary, I had the
ſatisfaction of hearing her perſon, her temper, and her underſtanding,
much commended; but this I did not want. The delicacy of your taſte, is equal
with me to a thouſand commendations. Mrs. W— is really ſo much
altered by her indiſpoſition, that I did not know her. She talks of going
to Bath this ſeaſon.—I talked of it too, and wiſh it of all earthly
things. You muſt know, I could not have come to Claverton <hi>inſtead</hi>
of going to W—, as I did not determine on the expedition at home; but at
a friend's houſe, where I was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my way
thither. Beſides, I would allow myſelf more time when I turn my face
towards Bath, than I could this <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1250901200:157"/> winter. Your invitation,
as it is very obliging, ſo it has many concurring circumſtances to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it at this time. I want to recover my health, which muſt be
recovered by Bath, or <hi>nothing</hi> I want to have you read ſome trifles
of mine, which muſt be ratified by you, or <hi>no one</hi>; but principally,
and above all, do I long to ſee you, my old friend, and Mrs. G—, whom I
expect you ſhould render my new one.—I am obliged for your charitable
endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my ſpirits. Your company would do it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
but ſcarce any thing leſs, in <hi>winter.</hi> Solitary life, limited
circumſtances, a phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic habit, and diſagreeable events, have given me
a melancholy turn, that is hardly diſſipated by the moſt ſerene ſky;
but in a north-eaſt wind, is quite intolerable. After a long ſtate of this
kind, upon every acceſs of amuſement, one is apt to think it is not
<hi>right</hi> to be happy; that it is one of Wollaſton's implicit lies; a
treating things contrary to what they <hi>deſerve.</hi>—Your
ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at Claverton is admired by moſt people; and, if you could
connect ſome little matter in the neighbourhood, would be as ſurely
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied.</p>
            <p>It is now high time to releaſe you.—This is not a letter,

you have ſomething of the ſame ſort of reaſon to be pleaſed with

which I conſider as naturally poſſeſſed of many beauties, each of

            <p>I cannot help adding a few ſtrokes to your picture of Mrs.

obſervations I made when I had ſome of his company at London. There was
ſomething accountable enough to me in their burleſquing Mr. L—'s
monody. He is, you know, engaged in a party, and his poem (though an
extraordinary fine compoſition) was too tender for the public ear. It
ſhould have been printed privately, and a number of copies diſperſed only
among their friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances;—but even ſo, it would have been

ſome relation of theirs, or only their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney? The affair is uncommonly

your room with oil colours, and made it <hi>really</hi> handſome.—I
drew out a feſtoon and a medal ſome time ago, for a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel over Mr.

the feſtoon executed in ſtone colour, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon painter;—yours is
better, and in character.—I am a degree more frugal than you; for I only
uſe quick lime, and either blue or yellow

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU will be amazed at my long ſilence; and it might reaſonably
excite ſome diſguſt if my days had paſſed of late in the manner they
uſed to do: but I am not the man I was; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I never <hi>ſhall</hi> be.
Alas! my deareſt friend! I have loſt my only brother! and, ſince the
fatal cloſe of November, I have had neither peace nor reſpite from
agonizing thoughts!</p>
            <p>You, I think, have <hi>ſeen</hi> my brother; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had no
opportunity of diſtinguiſhing him from the groupe of others, whom we call
<hi>good-natured</hi> men. This part of his character was ſo viſible in his
countenance, that he was generally beloved at ſight; <hi>I,</hi> who muſt
be allowed to know him, do aſſure you, that his underſtanding was no way
inferior to his benevolence. He had not only a ſound judgement, but a lively
wit and genuine humour. As theſe were many times eclipſed by his native
baſhfulneſs, ſo his benevolence only ſuffered by being ſhewn to an
exceſs. I here mean his giving too indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately into thoſe jovial
meetings of company, where the warmth of a ſocial temper is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with leſs reſerve; but the virtues of his head and heart would ſoon have
ſhone without alloy. The foibles of his youth were wearing off; and his
affection for me and regard to my advice, with his own good ſenſe, would
ſoon have rendered him all that I could have wiſhed in a ſucceſſor. I
never in my life knew a perſon more ſincere in the expreſſion of love
or diſlike. <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1250901200:163"/> But it was the <hi>former</hi> that
ſuited the propenſity of his heart; the <hi>latter</hi> was as tranſient
as the ſtarts of paſſion that occaſioned it. In ſhort, with much true
genius and real fortitude, he was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
acceptation, 
<q rend="inline">"a true honeſt man;"</q> and I think I may alſo
add, a truly Engliſh character; but 
<q rend="inline">"habeo, dixi? immo <hi>habui</hi> fratrem &amp;
amicum, Chreme!"</q> All this have I <hi>loſt</hi> in him. He is now in
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>this</hi> world no more than a mere idea. And this idea,
therefore, though deeply tinged with melancholy, I muſt, and ſurely
<hi>ought</hi> to, cheriſh and preſerve.</p>
            <p>I believe I wrote you ſome account of his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs laſt
ſpring; from which, to all appearance, he was tolerably well recovered. He
took the air, and viſited about with me, during the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer months of
ſummer; but my pleaſure was of ſhort duration. 
<q rend="inline">"Haeſit lateri lethalis arundo!"</q> The
peripneumony under which he laboured in the ſpring had terminated in an
adheſion of the lungs to the pleura, ſo that he could never lie but on his
right ſide; and this, as the weather grew colder, occaſioned an
obſtruction that could never be ſurmounted.</p>
            <p>Though my reaſon forewarned me of the event, I was not the more
prepared for it.—Let me not dwell upon it—.It is altogether
inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in <hi>every reſpect</hi>: and my imagination ſeems more
aſſiduous in educing pain from this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than I ever yet found it
in adminiſtering to my pleaſure.—This hurts me to no
purpoſe.—I know it; and yet, when I have avocated my thoughts, and
fixed them for a while upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amuſements, I ſuffer the ſame ſort
of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs as if I were guilty of a crime. Believe me, this has
been the moſt ſenſible affliction I ever felt in my life; and you, who
know my anxiety when I had far leſs reaſon to complain, will more eaſily
<hi>conceive</hi> it now, than I am able to deſcribe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1250901200:164"/>I cannot pretend to fill up my paper with my
uſual ſubjects.—I ſhould thank you for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon my
poetry; but I deſpiſe poetry: and I might tell you of all my little rural
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; but I hate them.—What can I now expect from my ſolitary
rambles through them, but a ſeries of melancholy reflections and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
anticipations?—Even the pleaſure I ſhould take in in ſhewing them
to <hi>you,</hi> the greateſt they can afford me, muſt be now greatly
inferior to what it might formerly have been.</p>
            <p>How have I proſtituted my ſorrow on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that little
concerned me! I am aſhamed to think of that idle 
<q rend="inline">"Elegy upon Autumn."</q> when I have ſo much more
important cauſe to hate and to condemn it <hi>now</hi>; but the glare and
gaiety of the Spring is what I <hi>principally</hi> dread; when I ſhall find
all things reſtored but my poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſomething like thoſe lines
of Milton will run for ever in my thoughts: 
<q> 
                  <l>Thus, with the year,</l> 
                  <l>
                     <hi>Seaſons</hi> return; but not to <hi>me</hi> returns</l> 
                  <l>A brother's cordial ſmile, at eve or morn.</l>
               </q> I ſhall
then ſeem to wake from amuſements, company; every <hi>ſort</hi> of
inebriation with which I have been endeavouring to lull my grief aſleep, as
from a dream; and I ſhall feel as if I were, <hi>that inſtant,</hi>
deſpoiled of all I have chiefly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thirty years together; of all my
preſent happineſs, and all my future proſpects. The melody of birds,
which he no more muſt hear; the chearful beams of the ſun, of which he no
more muſt partake; <hi>every</hi> wonted pleaſure will produce that
<hi>ſort</hi> of pain to which my temper is moſt obnoxious. Do not
conſider this as poetry.—Poetry on ſuch occaſions is no more than
literal truth. In the preſent caſe it is <hi>leſs</hi>; for half the
tenderneſs I feel is altogether ſhapeleſs and inexpreſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1250901200:165"/>After all, the wiſdom of the world may
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps eſteem me a gainer. Ill do they judge of this event, who think that
any ſhadow of amends can be made for the death of a brother, and the
diſappointment of all my ſchemes, by the acceſſion of ſome fortune,
which I never can enjoy!</p>
            <p>This is a mournful narrative: I will not, therefore, enlarge
it.—Amongſt all changes and chances, I often think of you; and pray
there may be no ſuſpicion or jealouſy betwixt us dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of

            <p>ALAS! dear Mr. W—! the terrible event has happened! I have
loſt the beſt of brothers; and you are to pity, not to condemn, your
unfortunate correſpondent.</p>
            <p>About the middle of November I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a letter for you, which
lies now amongſt my papers. At that time, amidſt all my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, I
had ſome hopes to ſupport me; but before I could ſend it, my ſituation
was greatly altered, and the month did not wholly expire, till it had
effectually rendered me the moſt wretched of mankind.</p>
            <p>Thus much it was neceſſary I ſhould tell you; you will pardon
me, if I do not deſcend any farther into an account of merit that is loſt,
and of ſorrow which is too apt to revive of itſelf. Be aſſured, it is
to me a loſs which the whole <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1250901200:166"/> world cannot
compenſate; and an affliction which the longeſt time I can live will not be
able to eraſe.</p>
            <p>You ſaid, you would let Maſter W— come and ſpend a few
days with me.—I beſeech you do.—It will be ſome relief to me;
and, God knows, I have occaſion enough for every aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than can
be drawn from correſpondence, company, or amuſement.</p>
            <p>You, Sir, I preſume, proceed in the innocent recreations of your
garden, and thoſe may at leaſt prove a balance for any ſmall diſquiets
that attend you. If greater ills befal you, you have perſons near you to
alleviate them. A wife, family, viſitants, male and female friends in
abundance, and a table ſufficiently hoſpitable to attract even your
enemies. With me the caſe is otherwiſe. What I have undergone this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>I DO not know why I made you a promiſe of a pretty long letter.
What I now write will be but a moderate one, both in regard to length and
ſtile; yet write I muſt, <hi>par maniere d'acquit,</hi> and you have
brought four-pence expence upon yourſelf for a parcel of nonſenſe, and to
no manner of purpoſe. This is not tautology, you <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1250901200:167"/>
muſt obſerve; for nonſenſe ſometimes anſwers very conſiderable

ſomething; what I cannot ſay,

The principal part of a correſpondence betwixt two idle men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in
two important enquiries—what we do, and how we do; but as all perſons
ought to give ſatisfaction before they expect to receive it, I am to tell you
in the firſt place, that my own health is tolerably good, or rather what I
muſt call good, being, I think, much better than it has been this laſt half
year.—Then as touching my occupation, alas! 
<q rend="inline">"Othello's occupation's gone!"</q> I neither read
nor write aught beſides a few letters; and I give myſelf up entirely to
ſcenes of diſſipation; lounge at my Lord Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's for near a week
together; make dinners; accept of invitations; ſit up till three o'clock in
the morning with young ſprightly married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, over white port and <hi>vin

the ſcythe; ſometimes inſpect, and draw mouldings for my carpenters;
ſometimes paper my walls, and at other times my cielings; do every ſocial

               <salute>Dear Mr. G—,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM very unfeignedly aſhamed to reflect how long it is ſince I
received your preſent, and how much longer it is ſince I received your
letter. I have been reſolving to write to you almoſt daily ever ſince you
left me; yet have fooliſhly enough permitted avocations (of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
leſs importance than your correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) to interfere with my gratitude,
my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and my inclination. What apology I have to make, though no way
adequate to my negligence, is in ſhort as follows. After the receipt of your
letter, I deferred writing till I could ſpeak of the arrival of your
picture.—This did not happen till about a month or five weeks ago, when I
was embarraſſed with maſons, carvers, carpenters, and company, all at a
time. And though it were idle enough to ſay, that I <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1250901200:169"/>
could not find <hi>one</hi> vacant hour for my purpoſe, yet in truth my head
was ſo confuſed by theſe multifarious diſtractions, that I could have
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nothing ſatisfactory either to <hi>myſelf</hi> or <hi>you:</hi>
nothing worth a ſingle <hi>penny,</hi> ſuppoſing the poſtage were to
coſt you no more. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had not <hi>finiſhed my rooms</hi> a minute,
when Lady Luxborough, Mrs. Davies, and Mr. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, with <hi>five</hi>
ſervants and a <hi>ſet</hi> of horſes, to ſtay with me for ſome time.
After a nine days' viſit, I returned with them to Barrels, where I continued
for a week; and whither (by the way) I go again with Lord Dudley in about a
fortnight's time. Other company filled up the interſtices of my ſummer; and
I hope my dear friend will accept of this apology for ſo long a chaſm of
ſilence, during which I have been uniformly at his ſervice, and true to
that inviolable friendſhip I ſhall ever bear him.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to thank you for the <hi>diſtinction,</hi> you
ſhew me, in ſending me your picture: I do it very ſincerely, It is
aſſuredly a ſtrong like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as my Lady Luxborough with all her
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that have <hi>ſeen you</hi> pronounce, as well as I;
conſequently more valuable to a <hi>friend</hi> than a face he does not know,
though it were one of Raphael's: The ſmile about the mouth is bad, as it
agrees but ill with the gravity of the eyes; and as a ſmile, ever ſo little
<hi>outre</hi> has a bad effect in a picture where it is <hi>conſtant,</hi>
though it may be ever ſo graceful in a perſon where it is
<hi>tranſitory.</hi> However, this may be altered, when I can meet with a
good painter. I have no <hi>other</hi> objection, but to the prominence of the
belly. The hair, I think, is good; and the coat and band no way exceptionable.
I have given it all the advantage I can: it has a good light, and makes part of
an elegant chimney-piece in a genteel, though little breakfaſt-room, at the
end of my houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:1250901200:170"/>Mr. Whiſtler and I are now upon good terms,
and two or three friendly letters have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged betwixt us. He
preſſes me to come to Whitchurch; and I <hi>him</hi> to come over to The
Leaſows; but the winter cometh, when no man can viſit.—The diſpute
is adjuſted by <hi>time,</hi> whilſt we are urging it by
<hi>expoſtulation.</hi>—No uncommon event in moſt ſublunary
projects!</p>
            <p>Lady Luxborough ſaid very extraordinary things in praiſe of Mrs.
G—, after you left us at Barrels; yet I ſincerely believe no more than
ſhe deſerves. I took the liberty of ſhewing her your letter here, as it
included a compliment to her, which I thought particularly genteel.—She
will always conſider you as a perſon of genius, and her friend.</p>
            <p>During moſt of this ſummer (wherein I have ſeen much company
either here or at Lord Dudley's) I have been almoſt conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in
one continued ſcene of <hi>jollity.</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to find
<hi>relief</hi> from ſuch ſort of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, when I had once
given in to it, I was obliged to proceed; as, they ſay, is the caſe when
perſons diſguiſe their face with paint.—<hi>Mine</hi> was a ſort
of <hi>painting</hi> applied to my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. 
<q rend="inline">"Spem vultu ſimulare, premere atrum corde

haggard and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn. My company has now deſerted me; the ſpleen-fogs begin
to riſe; and the <hi>terrible</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of laſt winter revive apace
in my memory. This is my ſtate of mind, while I write you theſe few lines;
yet, I thank God, my health is not much amiſs.</p>
            <p>I did not forget my promiſe of a box, &amp;c. to Mr. G—. I
had a dozen ſent me, one or two of which I could have liked, had they been
better <hi>finiſhed.</hi> They were of a good oval, white enamel, with

unnatural to ſubſtitute any ſubject in their place.</p>
            <p>I do ſincerely forgive your long ſilence, my good friend, indeed
I do; though it gave me uneaſineſs. I hope you do the ſame by mine. I
own, I could not readily account for the <hi>former</hi> period of yours, any
otherwiſe than by ſuppoſing that I had ſaid or done ſomething, in the
levity of my heart, which had given you diſguſt; but being conſcious to
myſelf of the moſt ſincere regard for you, and believing it could never
be diſcredited for any <hi>trivial</hi> inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertencies, I remember, I
continued ſtill in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a letter, and did not dream of writing
till ſuch time as I had received one. I truſted you would write at
<hi>laſt</hi>; and that, by all my paſt endeavours to demonſtrate my 
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1250901200:172"/> 
               <hi>friendſhip,</hi> you would believe the
<hi>tree</hi> was rooted in my heart, whatever irregularity you might obſerve
in the <hi>branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was my ſituation before that dreadful aera which gave me
ſuch a ſhock as to baniſh my beſt friends for a time out of my
memory.—And when they recurred, as they did the firſt of any thing, I
was made acquainted with that deplorable miſfortune of yours! Believe me, I
ſympathized in <hi>your</hi> affliction, notwithſtanding my own; but, alas!
what comfort could I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, who had need of every poſſible
aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſupport myſelf? I wrote indeed a few letters with
<hi>difficulty</hi>; amongſt the reſt, one to my friend Graves; but it was
to vent my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.—I will ſend you the letter, if you pleaſe, as
it is by far my leaſt painful method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying you ſome account of my
ſituation. Let it convince you, that I could have written nothing at that
time, which could have been of any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you: let it afford you, at
leaſt, a faint ſketch of my deareſt brother's character; but let it not
appear an oſtentatious diſplay of ſorrow, of which I am by no means
guilty. I know but too well that I diſcovered upon the occaſion, what
ſome would call, an unmanly tenderneſs; but I know alſo, that ſorrow
upon ſuch ſubjects as theſe is very conſiſtent with virtue, and with
the moſt abſolute reſignation to the juſt decrees of Providence. 
<q rend="inline">"Hominis eſt enim affici dolore,
<hi>ſentire</hi>; reſiſtere tamen &amp; ſolatia admittere, non
ſolatiis non egere."</q> Pliny.—I drank, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed amuſements,
never ſuffered myſelf to be a minute without company, no matter what, ſo
it was but continual. At length, by an attention to ſuch converſation and
ſuch amuſements as I could at other times deſpiſe, I forgot ſo far as
to be chearful.—And after this, the ſummer, through an almoſt
conſtant ſucceſſion of lively and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able viſitants, proved even a
ſcene of jollity.—It <pb n="156" facs="tcp:1250901200:173"/> was inebriation all, though
of a mingled nature; yet has it maintained a ſort of truce with grief, till
time can aſſiſt me more effectually by throwing back the event to a
diſtance.—Now, indeed, that my company have all forſaken me, and I am
delivered up to winter, ſilence, and reflection, the incidents of the laſt
year revive apace in my memory; and I am even aſtoniſhed to think of the
gaiety of my ſummer. The fatal anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the 
<q rend="inline">"dies quem ſemper acerbum, &amp;c."</q> is
beginning to approach, and every face of the ſky ſuggeſts the ideas of
laſt winter.—Yet I find myſelf chearful in <hi>company</hi>; nor
would I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you to be much alone.—You would lay the
higheſt obligation upon me by coming over at this time.—I preſſed
your brother, whom I ſaw at Birmingham, to uſe his influence with you; but
if you can by no means undertake the journey, I will take my ſpeedieſt
opportunity of ſeeing you at Harbury.—Mr. Miller invited me
ſtrenuouſly to meet Dr. Lyttelton at his houſe; but I believe my moſt
convenient ſeaſon will be, when my Lord Dudley goes to Barrels; for I can
but ill bear the penſiveneſs of a long and lonely expedition. After all, if
you <hi>could</hi> come hither firſt, it would afford me the moſt entire
ſatisfaction.—I have been making alterations in my houſe that would
amuſe you, and have many matters to diſcourſe with you, which it would be
endleſs to mention upon paper.—Adieu, my dear friend! may your merit be
known to ſome one who has greater <hi>power</hi> to ſerve you than
myſelf; but be aſſured, at the ſame time, that no one loves you better,
or eſteems you more.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ALTHOUGH I have many reaſons to urge why I did not write to you
before, or viſit you from Barrels as I fully intended, I will venture to wave
all particulars till I ſee you; and only aſſure you in the general, that
I was never able to write any thing ſatisfactory, or to viſit you, at that
time, with any ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
            <p>Believe me, my good friend, if <hi>inclination</hi> might have
ruled, I had been with you at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury many weeks ago. Sure I am, they muſt
be the <hi>cares</hi> of home, and not the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of it, that
<hi>ever were</hi> ſufficient to detain me during the <hi>winter
ſeaſon.</hi> Nor do I think I have an enemy that wiſhes me more
miſerable than I have, almoſt conſtantly, found myſelf ever ſince the
beginning of <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot even now fix a time when I can ſee you; and perhaps it
may be deferred till Mr. Miller's place will have received ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from the Spring; and, in that caſe, I would infallibly ſee my Lord
Guildford's; but I leave this undetermined; and I hope, if you <hi>can</hi>
wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from home with any kind of ſatisfaction, you will do me the juſtice
to believe, that you have no friend alive who will more gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you
than myſelf.</p>
            <p>I have papered ſome rooms this laſt year, and would willingly
have you ſee them before their colours are vaniſhed; which, I think, will
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be the caſe of <hi>one,</hi> before a ſecond ſummer be half
concluded.</p>
            <p>Thus is beauty as uncertain as either fortune or fame.</p>

               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1250901200:175"/>I ſuppoſe you have heard there is a

            <p>There is a moſt admirable piece of allegory on this head in the

            <p>I am truly ſorry to underſtand how much you are alone; I really

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I WROTE you ſome account of myſelf, and incloſed ſome
trivial criticiſms, in a letter I ſent you about a fortnight ago, which I
hope you have received.—Tom comes now to enquire after your health, and
to bring back my ode to Colonel Lyttelton; in regard to which, I deſire, that
you will not be ſparing of your animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I whiſpered my
difficulties to Mr. Miller at Hagley, how delicate I found the ſubject, and
how hard it was to ſatisfy either myſelf or others; in all which points he
agreed with me. Nevertheleſs, having twice broke my <hi>promiſe</hi> of
ſending a corrected copy to Sir George, I was obliged to make my peace by a
<hi>freſh</hi> one, which, I ſuppoſe, I muſt, of neceſſity,
perform.—Give me your whole ſentiments hereupon, I beſeech you; in
particular and in general, as a critic and as a friend.—The bad ſtate
of ſpirits which I complained of in my laſt, for a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether made
me utterly irreſolute: every thing occaſioned me ſuſpence; and I did
nothing with appetite.—This was owing in a great meaſure to a ſlow
nervous fever, as I have ſince diſcovered by many concurrent ſymptoms. It
is now, I think, wearing off by degrees. I ſeem to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1250901200:177"/> a little of that 
<q rend="inline">"vernal delight"</q> which Milton mentions, and
thinks 
<q> 
                  <l>Able to chaſe</l> 
                  <l>All ſadneſs, but deſpair.</l>
               </q> At leaſt, I begin to
reſume my ſilly clue of hopes and expectations; which, I know, however,
<hi>will</hi> not guide me to any thing more ſatisfactory than before.</p>
            <p>I have read ſcarce any new books this ſeaſon. Voltaire's new
Tragedy was ſent me from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but what has given me the moſt
amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>has</hi> been the 
<q rend="inline">"Lettres de Madame de Maintenon."</q> You have
probably read them already in Engliſh, and then I need not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them.
The Life of Lord Bolingbroke is entirely his <hi>public</hi> life, and the book
three parts filled with political remarks.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>writing,</hi> I have not attempted it this year and more;
nor do I know when I ſhall again.—However, I would be glad to correct
that Ode 
<q rend="inline">"To the Dutcheſs of Somerſet,"</q> when once I
can find in whoſe hands it is depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited. I was <hi>ſhewn</hi> a very
elegant letter of hers, the other day; wherein ſhe aſks for it with great
politeneſs. And as it includes nothing but a love of rural life, and ſuch
ſort of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſhe herſelf approves, I ſhall ſtand a good
chance of having it received with partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. She lives the life of a
<hi>religieuſe.</hi> She has <hi>written</hi> my Lady Luxborough a very
ſerious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of condolance upon the misfortune in her family; and need
enough has Lady Luxborough of ſo unchangeable a friend! for ſure nothing
could have happened to a perſon in her ſituation more
<hi>ſpecifically</hi> unfortunate.—Mr. Reynolds has been at Barrels, I
hear, and has brought her a machine that goes into a coat-pocket, yet
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the end of 
<q rend="inline">"a jack for boots, a reading-deſk, 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1250901200:178"/> a cribbage-board, a pair of ſnuffers, a ruler, an
eighteen inch-rule, three pair of nut-cracks, a lemon-ſqueezer, two
candleſticks, a picquet board, and the Lord knows what
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide."—</q>Can you form an idea of it? if you can, do you not think
it muſt give me pain to reflect, that I myſelf am uſeful for <hi>no</hi>
ſort of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when a paltry bit of wood can anſwer ſo
<hi>many?</hi> but, indeed, whilſt it <hi>pretends</hi> to theſe exploits,
it performs nothing <hi>well</hi>; and therein I agree with it. So true it is,
with regard to me, what I told you long ago, 
<q> 
                  <l>Multa &amp; praeclara minantem</l> 
                  <l>Vivere nec recte, nec ſuaviter!</l>

            <p>We have a turnpike bill upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into the

and Hales, and from thence to Hagley; but, I truſt, there will be a <hi>left
hand</hi> attraction, which will always make you deviate from the ſtrait
line.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be aſhamed to reflect how much I have dwelt upon
<hi>myſelf</hi> in this letter; but that I ſeriouſly approve of egotiſm
in letters; and were I <hi>not</hi> to do ſo, I ſhould not have any other
ſubject. I have not a ſingle neighbour, that is either fraught with

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM vexed to find you have no copy of thoſe verſes.—I
muſt make a freſh enquiry; and ſhould they happen to accompany this
let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I fear they will <hi>not,</hi> be ſo good as to aſſiſt me
all you can in the way of <hi>hints</hi> and <hi>corrections.</hi> Corrections
of what <hi>is,</hi> and hints of what <hi>may be.</hi> I do not reckon much
upon theſe verſes, or the patronage which you mention; though the
Dutcheſs is a woman of high reputation, and has as much benevolence as any
woman upon earth.</p>
            <p>I do <hi>not</hi> include the deſign of viſiting Bath as a
public place: I have long ſince given up ſuch ſchemes of gaiety and
expence. I viſit <hi>you</hi> and <hi>Mrs. Graves;</hi> at the leaſt, I
mean to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Inoculatioin is a point on which I never ſpeak a ſyllable in the
way of <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con:</hi> I mean, not ſo as to influence
particulars; for, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I eſteem it both right and ſalutary, and
even <hi>right</hi> becauſe we <hi>find</hi> it <hi>ſalutary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not know whether I could not bear the <hi>diſhonour</hi> of
friends or relations better than their <hi>death.</hi>—It muſt afford
one no ſmall ſatisfaction to give them one's affection and aſſiſtance
under every frailty to which human nature is expoſed; at leaſt, ſo long
as they are true to friendſhip. It is Mr. Whiſtler's opinion, as well as
mine. But Mr. —'s caſe is altogether different; and I make no
queſtion that he thinks as you do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion.</p>
            <p>Poor Danvers's death affects me more than you would perhaps imagine.
If you remember, I was at M— when the ſcheme of his going abroad was in
agitation.—I think how this event muſt affect Mrs. T—, whoſe
concern will not <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1250901200:182"/> be <hi>leſſened</hi> by her long
ſeparation from him. I dare ſay he reckoned upon his relations here as his
<hi>beſt eſtate,</hi> whatever he might gain elſewhere; and, no doubt,
the hope of retiring amongſt them has been a conſtant ſpur to his
diligence.—The event was always uncertain, and has proved at laſt
unfortunate; yet, as Melmoth ſays very juſtly, 
<q rend="inline">"The courſe of human affairs requires that we
ſhould act with vigour upon very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious contingencies."—</q>I
deſire you would give me a ſight of the Latin inſcription.</p>
            <p>I think it was the Gentleman's Magazine in which I was ſhewn your
verſes.</p>
            <p>I have a particular and lively idea of your place; though I do not
remember to have ſeen even ſuch <hi>parts</hi> of a ſcene as I have
united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my imagination. I cannot think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than that the
front-door opens here, the garden-door there, the ſtream runs in this place,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <q>Hac ibat Simois, haec eſt Sigeia tellus.</q>
            <p>The ſight of the place could not impreſs my imagination more
deeply; though the impreſſion I <hi>am to</hi> acquire will hardly leave
one line of my preſent one remaining. <hi>Cabbage-garden ornée</hi> is
very high burleſque, and affects the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your friend too
nearly.</p>
            <p>Let me know in what manner Mrs. Graves and you are drawn. Be as
particular as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I could not be clear from your letter whether you had received the
box or not. That, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the tallies, lay on the table before me, while
I wrote to you laſt; and went with my letter to Birmingham.—Pray
ſatisfy me directly whether you received them.—They are trifles,
indeed; but, as they acquit me of my promiſe, they are virtually of
conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1250901200:183"/>Mr. Whiſtler has not anſwered a letter
which I ſent him above two months ago: nay, I think, a quarter of a year.</p>
            <p>You are rich.—I have only to wiſh the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of your
riches, with ſome diminution of your fatigue. And yet the moſt laborious
man in the world is, I am fully aſſured, more happy than the

I think it a noble Tragedy; abounding as much with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſentiments and
elevated expreſſions, as 
<q rend="inline">"The Gameſter"</q> and 
<q rend="inline">"The Earl of Eſſex"</q> are deficient in
<hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My verſes are not yet ſent to Sir George Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telton; <hi>I</hi>
ſtart new difficulties, and cannot make them to my mind: yet have promiſed
him a copy, and diſappointed him thrice; and can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defer it much longer
without great offence.</p>
            <p>I have ſcarce been twenty yards from home this winter. Laſt
night I viſited one of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and what with wine, ſitting up late,
a perfect flux of diſcourſe, and a return home through the dark, found
myſelf <hi>vertiginous</hi> before I was aware. Never did Prior's manly
deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 
<q rend="inline">"I drank, I liked it not, &amp;c."</q> ſeem ſo
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to me as it does to-day. I am abſolutely vile in my own ſight, and
I abhor myſelf in duſt and aſhes. I was <hi>never</hi> ſo intoxicated
as not to know what I ſaid, or to talk more non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; and yet how many
things could I wiſh unſaid that I let fall laſt night!</p>
            <p>We are going to add two new bells to our preſent ſet of ſix;
to have a turnpike-road from Hagley to Birmingham, through Hales; and to emerge
a little from our obſcurity. I am, dear Sir, with compliments to Mrs.

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SEND you my Ode, as I ſent it to the Dutcheſs ſome weeks
ago. Why I pitched upon one reading ſooner than another, I will not now
explain: nor will I trouble you to make any freſh remarks upon it at
preſent; only, when you happen to read it over at your leiſure, if any
thing occurs to you that would tend to perfect it, I would beg you
occaſionally to make ſome memorandums. I have not yet received an anſwer;
but, as I accompanied the verſes with a letter, I ſuppoſe I ſhall
receive one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I alſo added, to fill a blank ſpace in my
paper-book, a poem which I call 
<q rend="inline">"The Viſta;"</q> and which you may perhaps
recollect: how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly I know not, for I had the benefit of no perſon's
<hi>judgement</hi> or advice.</p>
            <p>Lord Dudley made Mr. Dolman a preſent of a piece of plate, a large
cup, in conſideration of his ſiſter's being at Broom about half a year.
There was on it, one ſupporter awkwardly enough holding up the coronet in his
paw; and from the coronet proceeded a label, with 
<q rend="inline">"amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ergo Dudley."</q> I do not know who was the
manager, or whence he had the inſcription; but I think, from Dr. H—.
This is <hi>elegant</hi> and <hi>enough.</hi> Nevertheleſs, as there may be
ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in dazzling the eyes of the people where I dwell, and as
<hi>ſuch</hi> eyes as theirs are not to be dazzled, and hardly
<hi>ſtruck,</hi> by <hi>elegance</hi> alone, I choſe the method that was
moſt <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent.</hi>—I wiſh they are not invidious enough to
ſay, that <hi>his</hi> arms are engraved there for want of ſome of my
<hi>own:</hi> ſo I would not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their notable
ſuggeſtion.—I have truly ſo <pb n="166" facs="tcp:1250901200:185"/> low an opinion
of arms ſince they became pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeable by money, and ſince the preſent
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited uſe of them, that were I to find a coat to my name in the office,
which I did not like, I would not uſe it; but ſubſtitute what was more
agreeable: yet ſome <hi>ſort</hi> of <hi>right</hi> or <hi>claim</hi> is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſatisfy one's delicacy, with an opinion of <hi>property</hi>;
and indeed, to fix one's <hi>choice,</hi> where one has the whole furniture of
the univerſe for <hi>its</hi> object.—After all, the vulgar are more
ſtruck with arms than any thing; 
<q rend="inline">"ſtupet in titulis &amp; imaginibus;"</q> and, I
believe, there were near two hundred people gathered round Lady Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough's
landau at Birmingham, and declaring her arms to be very <hi>noble,</hi> or
otherwiſe.—I do not, therefore, chuſe to employ a vulgar
<hi>mind</hi> about this matter.—Were you to go London, I ſhould gladly
ſolicit <hi>you</hi>; or if you have any friend you could write to in town,
to ſearch the office; for really I have none that I like <hi>for the
purpoſe.</hi> It will not coſt above a couple of ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.—I will
ſend you a draught of the lid of my ſtandiſh when it arrives:—for I
really do not know what Mr. Hylton will put upon it: I find, he conſults with
Dr. B—, my Lord's phyſician.—
<q rend="inline">"<hi>De</hi> Dudley"</q> would run moſt
abominably, and 
<q rend="inline">"Baro Dudley"</q> may be authorized by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practice of Maittaire.—If it be inſcribed 
<q rend="inline">"Dudley"</q> 
               <hi>alone,</hi> I can add the reſt if
I ſhould hereafter think proper; and I wiſh it may be ſo.</p>
            <p>My verſes to the Colonel are not yet tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>I think the Latin inſcription to your brother very elegant; and I
ſhould not care to have any part of it omitted.—I would, by all means,
have this little hiſtory of his life perpetuated. 
<q rend="inline">"His ſaltem, &amp;c."</q> And were you to put it
into Engliſh, it would be too long for an inſcription;—unleſs you
were, by means of a printed elegy with notes, or any other ſuch method, to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1250901200:186"/> the ſame effect; and then you might make the
epitaph as ſhort as you pleaſed.—After all the <hi>firſt</hi>
method is perhaps as eligible. When the affair is nearer a concluſion, I
ſhould be glad to be of any ſervice.—I will think, and write again
about it,</p>
            <p>And now, having ſpoke to ſuch matters as have been the ſubject
of our late correſpondence, I am at liberty to diverſify my letter as I
may.—I ſhould be glad to know in your next whether you have heard of
late from Mr. Whiſtler; and whether he is confined at home as uſual by his
mother's ſtate of health. I almoſt deſpair of ever ſeeing him again at
The Leaſows, though there is hardly any pleaſure I ſo much covet as that
of ſurprizing him with the <hi>alterations</hi> I have <hi>made,</hi> and the
<hi>articles</hi> I have <hi>purchaſed,</hi> during the five years ſince he
was in Shropſhire: add to this, the ſeveral <hi>acquaintances</hi> I have
formed which he would like, and the amuſing viſits I could pay hereabouts
with freedom.—I do not know whether you ſaw Mr. Davenport and his
family at Bath this ſpring. He is laying out his environs, and I am by
appointment to go over the week after next. He has alſo a painter at this
time taking views round his houſe; which is one of the moſt magnificent in
our country; yet I never leave home but with reluctance.—I real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>love</hi> no PLACE ſo well; and it is a great favour in me to allot any
one a week of my <hi>ſummer.</hi>—Add to this, that my conſtitution
requires nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and I am moſt <hi>happy,</hi> where I am moſt
<hi>free.</hi> It is in vain to ſay, they <hi>allow</hi> you all freedom,
where you cannot allow it <hi>yourſelf.</hi> For this reaſon, I never more
enjoy myſelf, than I do at The Grange; and yet this to ſome may appear
paradoxical.</p>
            <p>I yeſterday embelliſhed my chalybeate ſpring.—The
inſcription that is <hi>out</hi> on the ſtone, is as follows, viz.

<date>Jan. 29, 1754.</date>
               </dateline> 
               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM at a loſs how to begin this letter.—I will not,
however, after the uſual way, give you a tedious liſt of <hi>apologies</hi>
in the front of it. Some account of my long ſilence you will find
diſperſed throughout the letter; and as for what is deficient, I will
depend upon your friendſhip.</p>
            <p>There has not been a perſon here ſince you left me, of whom I
could obtain the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence concerning you. And as an enquiry by the
poſt was my only obvious method, I do acknowledge myſelf to blame,
notwithſtanding all the excuſes that I can make.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the conflux of viſitants whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this
ſeaſon, I was hardly once <hi>ſo</hi> happy as I was in <hi>your</hi>
company. I was the happier in ſeeing <hi>you</hi> ſo; and, if you remember,
I took notice at the time, how little your vivacity was impaired in
compariſon of my own. If I was <hi>then</hi> but a dull <hi>companion,</hi>
gueſs whether ſolitude and winter were likely to make me a better
<hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent.</hi> That vein of gaiety and humour, which you were once
ſo partial as to diſcover in my letters, will ſcarce appear there any
more: not even to the eyes of the moſt partial friend I have. Should you deny
what I aſſert, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to a fit of ſpleen, yet you may
<hi>allow</hi> that it will ſcarce enliven any letter that I write in
<hi>winter.</hi> Friendſhip ſtill remains! Friendſhip, like the root of
ſome perennial flower, even <hi>then</hi> perhaps gathers ſtrength in
ſecret; that it may afford a better diſplay of its colours in the
ſpring.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend this to be an adequate apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. I know, my
deareſt friend, that you both <hi>like</hi> to ſee and hear from me: it
proves, however, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1250901200:189"/> that you have no great <hi>loſs</hi>
either of my letters or my company.</p>
            <p>I am, as the phraſe is, deeply penetrated by the civilities of
your Mr. Miller. He took a ſhort dinner with me once this ſeaſon,
dropping Sir George at Mr. P—'s.—He could not have pleaſed me
better.—Here he happened to meet Mr. Lyttelton and Captain Whood. He
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breakfaſted here, and in general ſeemed glad of every
occaſion to bring me the genteeleſt company. To him I owe Miſs Banks and
Lord Temple. Can you think that Radway now, as well as Harbury, has no
attractions for me? You know me too well; but I have not truly ſuch a ſtate
of health as to dare to be from home. Friends will ſay 
<q rend="inline">"you may be as free at our houſes as your own,
&amp;c."</q> and they will <hi>mean</hi> as they <hi>ſay;</hi> but if you
cannot make <hi>yourſelf</hi> ſo, what is all this to the purpoſe?</p>
            <p>I cannot give you a detail of what has paſſed with me ſince I
ſaw you. Lord Dudley, with myſelf, made one viſit to Lord Plymouth's. We
met Mr. and Mrs. Winnington.—We took a trip to Mr. Vernon's, where we
found Mr. Coventry and other company. The impreſſions I received from them
would afford ſubject for <hi>converſation</hi> betwixt you and me; but I
muſt not aſſign too much of my paper to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Lord Plymouth's piece of water ſhould have been a ſerpentine
river. I could give you ſtrong reaſons.—I think my Lord ſuch a
character as will make a reputable figure in life:—<hi>beloved</hi> he
<hi>is,</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> be at firſt ſight.—Lady Plymouth is
the moſt amiable of women; and, of all the world, the propereſt perſon
that my Lord could have choſen. The plan for their houſe I think right;
ſuppoſing it right to continue it where it is. The park is capable of
ſome conſiderable beauties. Lord Plymouth has been once here 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1250901200:190"/> ſince, and talks of cauſing me to come, and deſign
for his environs.—I ſeem to be highly in his favour.—I hope
ſome time to meet you there.</p>
            <p>My Ode, after an aſtoniſhing delay, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the
Dutcheſs of Somerſet.—It produced me two genteel letters from her
Grace. I am well ſatisfied with the event, for ſome reaſons, which I will
one day give you—none of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—Soon after this, Dodſley
preſſed me to contribute, as amply as I pleaſed, to a fourth volume of
his Miſcellanies. I at firſt meant to do ſo pretty largely; I then
changed my mind, and ſent only ſome little pieces. Part of theſe were my
own; part Mr. Whiſtler's, Mr. Graves's, and ſome accidental pieces of
others, which I found in my bureau.—I purpoſed to ſend ſomething of
yours too; of <hi>myſelf,</hi> if I was <hi>hurried</hi>; elſe, not without
your conſent. What I thought of was, your Linnets. Laſt week he writes me
word, that the town will now be too much engroſſed by the buſineſs of
elections; and that he does not proceed this winter.—So that we ſhall
now, you ſee, have time to meet, or write upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Mr. Graves ſent me the encloſed little, fable, for Dodſley, if
I approved it.—I made ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, and ſent it.—Return it
to me, if you pleaſe.—It is pretty; but the inſcription muſt be 
<q rend="inline">"To a Friend."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some correſpondence I have had this winter with Mr. Hylton, about
toys and trinkets which he gets done for me in London. He is by far a better
<hi>friend</hi> and <hi>correſpondent</hi> than a <hi>poet.</hi> Should you
take a trip to town, he would be quite <hi>proud</hi> to ſee you.</p>
            <p>I am now, like the reſt of the world, peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sir Charles
Grandiſon.—I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that world <hi>joins</hi> me, in
preferring Clariſſa. The author wants the art of <hi>abridgement</hi> in
every <pb n="172" facs="tcp:1250901200:191"/> thing that he has written, yet I am much his
admirer.</p>
            <p>My dear friend! cheriſh and preſerve your own vivacity, and let
not this phlegmatic epiſtle impair it. If occaſion offers, call on me for
my <hi>own</hi> ſake; and believe you have not alive a more affectionate
friend.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is a long, long time, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of
friendſhip, ſince I had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a line from you, and I write
chiefly to remind you of it; not with any hopes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording you the
amuſement of a ſingle minute. In truth, I have not ſpirits for it. The
ſeverity, the duration, the ſolitude, of this winter have well-nigh
exhauſted them.—The ſucceſſion, the regular ſucceſſion, of
pain and pleaſure becomes every day more clear to me. It begins to ſeem as
ordinary as the courſe of day and night. Thus my laſt ſummer was the
moſt amuſing I ever ſaw; my winter the moſt diſagreeable. Allow me to
accept one only: I mean, that ever-mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful winter which robbed me of my
deareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sometimes this pain and pleaſure are contraſted within
the compaſs of a day. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in different weeks, &amp;c. &amp;c.
However, do not think me ſuperſtitious. There is hardly a perſon that is
<hi>leſs</hi> ſo. Yet I am firmly perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the alternation, either
in the mind, or in the events themſelves. My ſummer, I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was
highly entertaining; my winter render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1250901200:192"/> equally
diſagreeable, by a long-continued ſquabble amongſt our principal
pariſhioners, and by the death of my beſt-beloved and the moſt
accompliſhed of my relations, M— D—. She riſqued going to
London for the ſake of finding ſomething <hi>new</hi>; was ſeized with
the ſmall-pox, and died in all her bloom.—The natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which we ſhould draw from obſervations of this ſort is, equanimity; 
<q rend="inline">"aequam memento rebus, &amp;c."</q> and again, 
<q rend="inline">"ſperat infeſtis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit ſecundis,
&amp;c."</q> Enough of this, which I ſhould not mention, but that the fact
itſelf ſtrikes me continually more and more; and were I to mark the
pleaſing and unpleaſing parts of my exiſtence in an almanac, as the
Romans did their <hi>Faſti</hi> and <hi>Nefaſti,</hi> I know not if, at the
year's end, the black and white marks would not nearly balance each other.</p>
            <p>I have bought Hogarth's Analyſis: it is really entertaining; and
has, in ſome meaſure, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted my notions with regard to beauty in
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. For inſtance, were I to draw a ſhield, I could give you reaſons
from hence why the ſhape was pleaſing or diſagreeable. I would have you
<hi>borrow</hi> and read it.</p>
            <p>Grandiſon I cannot think equal to Clariſſa; though, were merit
in this age to be preferred, the author of it deſerves a biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>Jago has been fortunate for once; but the value of his livings
muſt be exaggerated in the news-papers.</p>
            <p>If Mr. Whiſtler would give me a viſit in the height of my
ſeaſon this year, I would look upon it as one of the moſt pleaſing
events that could happen to the remainder of my life; and I would not preſume
to hope that fate would ever allow me a repetition of it.</p>
            <p>My love of toys is not quite exhausted.—I have purchaſed, or
rather renovated, ſome that are both rich and beautiful, though ſhort of 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1250901200:193"/> what I meant them. I have amuſed myſelf with
deſigning little ornaments this winter, ſome of which may turn to account
under the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Birmingham mechanic.—To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
<hi>eaſe,</hi> in that ſeaſon, is the moſt, that I can <hi>hope</hi>;
and it is more than I often <hi>obtain.</hi>

            <p>THE melancholy account of our dear friend Whiſtler's death was
conveyed to me, at the ſame inſtant, by yours and by his brother's letter.
I have written to his brother this poſt: though I am very ill able to write
upon the ſubject, and would willingly have waved it longer, but for decency.
The trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate which was the greateſt happineſs, and the greateſt
pride, of my life is broken! The fabric of an ingenuous and diſintereſted
friendſhip has loſt a noble column! yet it may, and <hi>will,</hi> I
truſt, endure till one of us be laid as low. In truth, one can ſo little
ſatisfy one's ſelf with what we ſay upon ſuch ſad occaſions, that I
made three or <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1250901200:194"/> four eſſays before I could
<hi>endure</hi> what I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his brother.—Be ſo good as to
excuſe me to him as well as you can, and eſtabliſh me in the good opinion
of him and Mr. Walker.</p>
            <p>Poor Mr. Whiſtler! how do all our little ſtrifes and bickerments
appear to us at this time! yet we may with comfort reflect, that they were not
of a <hi>ſort</hi> that touched the <hi>vitals</hi> of our friendſhip; and
I may ſay that we fondly loved and eſteemed each other, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. 
<q rend="inline">"Tales animas <hi>oportuit</hi> eſſe
concordes."</q> Poor Mr. Whiſtler! not a ſingle acquaintance have I made,
not a ſingle picture or curioſity have I purchaſed, not a ſingle
embelliſhment have I given to my place, ſince he was laſt here, but I
have had his approbation and his amuſement in my eye. I will aſſuredly
inſcribe my larger urn to his memory; nor ſhall I paſs it without a
pleaſing melancholy during the remainder of my days. We have each of us
received a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from <hi>his</hi> converſation, which no other
converſation can afford us at our preſent time of life.</p>
            <p>Adieu! my dear friend! may our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the perſon we have
loſt be the ſtrong and everlaſting cement of our affection! Aſſure
Mr. John Whiſtler of the regard I have for him, upon his <hi>own</hi>
account, as well as his brother's. Write to me; directly if you have
opportunity. Whether you have or no, believe me to be ever moſt

occaſioned me much concern, and indeed ſome tears: yet as <hi>thoſe</hi>
particulars are what one covets to hear, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly which they produce
is never unmixed with pleaſure, I think myſelf much obliged to you for the
care you took to convey them. It is poſſible, the letters I wrote to you
and Mr. J. Whiſtler might appear too tender from a <hi>mere</hi> friend of
the deceaſed; but there is a ſympathy betwixt friends, which is not always
found amongſt relations; nor does <hi>kindred</hi> imply
<hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> a whit more than <hi>friendſhip</hi> does
<hi>kindred.</hi> It is not many weeks ago, that I had a bill filed againſt
me in Chancery by young D—, the only near relation I have by the mother's
ſide; and the next in lineal ſucceſſion to my ſhare of the Penn's
eſtate.—Do not let this ſurprize you. I believe the affair will be
accommodated.—He only wanted to procure a diviſion of the Harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
eſtate at a large expence, which might be better adjuſted without
<hi>any</hi>; in other words, to run his head againſt a ſtone-wall, that he
might have a chance of cauſing it to tumble upon <hi>me.</hi> Would you
conſent that I ſhould ſuffer him to have the manſion-houſe at
Harborough thrown into his lot? Were I ſo to do, I could make it advantageous
to myſelf, and the diſpute were at an end; but I have a kind of romantic
venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that <hi>place</hi> and <hi>family</hi>; which, if you
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I have expreſſed in one of my beſt elegies<note n="*" place="bottom">Elegy xv.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1250901200:196"/>Pray what will become of our letters to Mr.
Whiſtler? as I am not conſcious of any thing diſhonourable in mine (and I
am <hi>ſure</hi> I may ſay the ſame of yours) methinks I could wiſh
that they might not be deſtroyed. It is from a few letters of my own or
others alone, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally preſerved, that I am able to recollect what I
have been doing ſince I was born.</p>
            <p>I met, when I was laſt at Barrels, a ſurgeon of Bath, whoſe
name, I think, was Cleland. He knew your name and place; but, I find, was not
perſonally acquainted with you.—I am glad enough to hear that your
place gets into vogue. It is, I think, what you ſhould <hi>chuſe,</hi> upon
all accounts. Let the beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its
<hi>owner.</hi> I have often thought, myſelf, that were a perſon to live at
The Leaſows, of more merit than myſelf, and a few degrees more worldly
prudence, he could ſcarce want opportunities to procure his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.
My rural embelliſhments are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more conſiderable than yours; but then
the vicinity of Bath might occaſion you a greater conflux.—Your
unexpenſive illuminations pleaſe me highly.—I have purpoſed theſe
many years to purchaſe a ſet of tin lamps, of about four-pence a-piece, to
ſtick againſt trees, and to uſe upon occaſion in my coppice; or rather
in my grove, where ſome of the water-falls would not fail to ſhew
delightfully.</p>
            <p>You aſked me about Jago's preferment. The living <hi>laſt
given</hi> him by the Biſhop of Worceſter is, I believe, near an hundred
pounds a year.—With this, he has Harbury of about fifty; and
Cheſlerton, a ſort of chapel of eaſe, about forty; in the <hi>whole,</hi>
therefore, about a hundred and ninety: but then he is obliged to keep a curate;
and what I think yet worſe is, that he cannot make it <hi>convenient</hi> to
<hi>live</hi> at his new ſituation, which is a pretty one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1250901200:197"/>I have had ſome viſitants this ſeaſon;
indeed as many, and as conſiderable, as ſuch a ſort of ſeaſon could
afford me. A Scotch peer called upon me in his way through Birmingham: his
title was —. He ſeemed to have a very clear head, a very polite and
eaſy manner, and all the refinement of true taſte, <hi>without</hi> the
warmth or appetite.—I could not help thinking him, on many accounts,
characteriſtic of the Scottiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Would to God I could ſee you and Mrs. Graves here this ſummer! I
have the ſame wiſh it may be <hi>my</hi> lot to viſit <hi>you,</hi> next
autumn. Be aſſured, I <hi>purpoſe</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I expect Dodſley every week. He will, I am convinced, be for
publiſhing his Miſcellany next winter. Would Mr. W—, think you,
agree, that you and I ſhould be allowed to publiſh ſuch of poor Mr.
Whiſtler's papers there, as we judged were moſt likely to do credit to his
memory?</p>
            <p>Adieu! dear Mr. Graves. Let us reconcile our affections to the
ordinary events of life; and let us adopt my friend Jago into our ſecond
triumvirate. I am, however, always, with <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> attachment,
yours,</p>

Ayleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury—ingenious, eaſy-behaved, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

               <p>I look upon my ſcheme of embelliſhing my farm as the only

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is certainly ſome argument of a <hi>peculiarity</hi> in the
eſteem I bear you, that I feel a readineſs to acquaint you with
<hi>more</hi> of my foibles, than I care to truſt with any other perſon. I
believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhews us more plainly either the different <hi>degrees</hi>
or <hi>kinds</hi> of regard that we entertain for our ſeveral friends (I may
alſo add the <hi>difference</hi> of their <hi>characters</hi>) than the
ordinary ſtyle and tenour of the letters we addreſs to them.</p>
            <p>I confeſs to <hi>you,</hi> that I am conſiderably morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by
Mr. John W—'s conduct in regard to my letters to his brother; and, rather
than they ſhould have been ſo unnecceſſarily deſtroyed, would have
given more money than is allowable for me to mention with <hi>decency.</hi> I
look upon my letters as ſome of <hi>my</hi> chef-d'oeuvres; and, could I be
ſuppoſed to have the leaſt pretenſions to propriety of ſtyle or
ſentiment, I ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it muſt appear, principally, in my letters
to his brother, and one or two more friends. I conſidered them as the records
of a <hi>friendſhip</hi> that will be always <hi>dear</hi> to me; and as the
<hi>hiſtory</hi> of my <hi>mind</hi> for theſe twenty years laſt paſt.
The amuſement I ſhould have found in the peruſal of <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1250901200:199"/> them would have been altogether innocent; and I would gladly have
preſerved them, if it were only to explain thoſe which I ſhall preſerve
of his brother's. Why he ſhould allow either <hi>me</hi> or <hi>them</hi>
ſo very little weight as not to <hi>conſult</hi> me with regard to them, I
can by no means conceive. I ſuppoſe it is not <hi>uncuſtomary</hi> to
return them to the ſurviving friend. I had no anſwer to the letter which I
wrote Mr. J. W—. I received a ring from him; but as I thought it an
inadequate memorial of the friendſhip which his brother had for me, I gave it
to my ſervant the moment I received it; at the ſame time I have a neat
ſtandiſh, on which I cauſed the lines Mr. W— left with it to be
inſcribed; and which appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer.</p>
            <p>I have read your new production with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and as this letter
begins with a confeſſion of foibles, I will own, that through mere
lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have ſent you back your copy, in which I have made ſome
eraſements, inſtead of giving you my reaſons on which thoſe
eraſements were founded. Truth is, it ſeems to me to want mighty few
variations from what is now the preſent text; and that, upon one more
peruſal, you will be able to give it as much perfection as you mean it to
have. And yet, did I ſuppoſe you would inſert it in Dodſley's
Collection, as I ſee no reaſon you have to the contrary, I would take any
pains about it that you ſhould deſire me. I muſt beg another copy, at
your leiſure.</p>
            <p>I ſhould like the inſcription you mention upon a real
ſtone-urn, which you purchaſe very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable at Bath; but you muſt
not riſque it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vaſe you mention, on any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Now I mention Bath, I muſt acquaint you, that I have received
intelligence from the younger Dodſley, that his brother is now there, and
that <pb n="181" facs="tcp:1250901200:200"/> none of the papers I ſent him are yet <hi>ſent
to preſs</hi>; that he expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth of
November, when he proceeds with his publication. Poſſibly you may go to
Bath whilſt he is there, and, if ſo, may chuſe to have an interview.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſend two or three little pieces of my own, in hopes that
you will adjuſt the reading, and return them as ſoon as you conveniently
can. All I can ſend to-night is this 
<q rend="inline">"Ode to Memory."</q> I ſhall in the laſt place
deſire your opinion as to the manner of <hi>placing</hi> what is ſent. The
firſt pages of his Miſcellany muſt be already fixed. I think to propoſe
ours for the laſt; but as to the <hi>order,</hi> it will depend entirely upon
you.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WERE I to pronounce my ſentence upon the long ſuſpenſion of
our correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I ſhould impute the blame of it, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<hi>equal</hi> meaſure, to <hi>yourſelf</hi> and to <hi>me.</hi> To
<hi>you,</hi> for an omiſſion of the letter you <hi>promiſed</hi> me,
when laſt in town; to me, for waiting in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it, and for
neglecting to do <hi>juſtice</hi> to the ſentiments of my heart on the
occaſion of your late preferment. Great were the hopes I had indeed
conceived, that your increaſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue had been accompanied with a place
of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence which was more <hi>to your mind</hi> than that 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1250901200:201"/> where you at preſent abide; but I do not find by any
accounts that you purpoſe to leave Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; for which, no doubt, you have
reaſons which I do not yet penetrate; but which may demand my aſſent the
moment you diſcover them. I have but little to ſay of the life I have led
ſince you received ſome account of me from Mr. Hyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in London. The
Winter, or at leaſt its <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> continued to tyrannize during
the <hi>minority</hi> of Spring; and the Spring has alike been ſlow in giving
up the reins to Summer. Of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I ſeem in a ſort of middle
ſtate, betwixt a dull half-animated grub, and an inſignificant loco-motive
fly. Neither in the <hi>one</hi> ſtate or <hi>other</hi> am I of the leaſt
importance; but, from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances which I have <hi>already</hi> made, you are
<hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> the more likely to find me in your garden. About a
fortnight ago I received a line or two from our intimate acquaintance and
ſchool-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Mr. Hall. It was brought me by Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Boughton's
gardener; a fellow of good taſte, to whom Mr. Hall deſired I would cauſe
The Leaſows to be ſhewn. I find you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Mrs. Hall by ſome
alterations which you propoſe for their environs, and which they tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
reſolve to put in execution. When I come over into Warwickſhire, as I hope
to do ſoon, I ſhall be very glad to make them a viſit in your company. My
ſpirits, though far from good, are better, in the main, than they were in
winter; and, on ſome peculiar days, are raiſed as high as to <hi>alacrity:
very</hi> ſeldom higher; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo high.</p>
            <p>You muſt (from hence at leaſt) take matters in the order or
rather <hi>diſorder</hi> in which they occur: Mr. Miller I ſaw on
Wedneſday laſt in Lady Lyttelton's coach, who ſtopped two minutes at my
gate on her return from London. I enquired concerning you; but could gather no
intelligence.—Mr. Hylton, who is now in Warwickſhire (if 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1250901200:202"/> he have not ſtrolled to London) has been with me
ſeveral months this ſummer. He is adding a room or two to his place, which
lies very near me; and purpoſes to reſide there as ſoon as it is
finiſhed. The ſituation is not void of beauties; but, if you will pardon
the vanity, muſt veil its bonnet to mine. I have heard of planting hollies,
pyracanthas, and other berry-bearing greens, to attract thoſe Black-birds
which you have ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually celebrated: it ſhall be <hi>my</hi> ambition
to plant good neighbours; and, what with Lord Dudley and his exotics, Mr.
Hylton with his foſſils, and myſelf with my <hi>ferme ornée,</hi>
is there not ſome room to expect that we may attract the taſters this way?
but firſt we muſt take ſome care to <hi>advertiſe</hi> them where their
treaſures lie.—Another day is paſſed, and Mr. Miller, &amp;c. has
again been with me, and waked me out of a ſound ſleep to
breakfaſt.—He mentions with what reluctance he <hi>left</hi> a
ſurveyor at Radway, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in taking plans of the field of battle near
Edge-hill. This he purpoſes to enrich with a number of anecdotes, gleaned
from his neighbourhood; which muſt probably render it extremely entertaining:
and ſurely Edge-bill fight was never more unfortunate to the nation, than it
was lucky for Mr. Miller. He prints, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this plan, another ſheet
of Radway Caſtle. I approve his deſign. He will, by theſe means, turn
every bank and hillock of his eſtate there, if not into
<hi>claſſical,</hi> at leaſt into <hi>hiſtorical</hi> ground.</p>
            <p>I have done mighty little about my grounds ſince laſt winter. As
indolence has on <hi>many</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions contributed to <hi>impair</hi> my
finances, it is but juſt that it ſhould ſometimes contribute to
<hi>reſtore</hi> them. Yet I am not quite deſtitute of ſomething new for
your amuſement.</p>
            <p>Of late I have neither <hi>read</hi> nor <hi>written</hi> a
ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. What pleaſed me laſt was Hogarth's Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis. 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1250901200:203"/> I expect Dodſley down every week; and as he will
ſpend a few days with me, I could wiſh you were to meet him. His genius is
truly poetical, and his ſentiments altogether liberal and ingenuous.</p>
            <p>I am, at preſent, a ſurveyor of roads: em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in repairing my
lane to the turnpike—How glad ſhould I be to meet you, and to ſhew
you its <hi>beauties!</hi> to ſhew you Mr. Hylton's new ſeries of coins;
—his <hi>deſigns</hi> as well as his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances</hi> at
Lappa!—how glad ſhould I be to ſee you! yea, I would hardly fail to
return with you to Harbury; were you to add this one obligation. I left Mr.
Miller in doubt whether he would not ſee me at Radway ſome time next week.
Evil and capricious health (the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of which would make a detail of no
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance) deſtroys all my punctuality, and bids me promiſe with
<hi>fear.</hi> You, I truſt, are moſtly at home; and were you to be at
Snitterfield, I would follow you without reluctance. So, with hopes to ſee
you ſhortly, either in Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire or Shropſhire, I relinquiſh the
ſubject.</p>
            <p>I have reſerved a very melancholy ſubject for the laſt. May
you, and Mr. Graves, and myſelf, ſtand firm to ſupport the fabric of
friendſhip, which has loſt a very beautiful column in poor Mr. Whiſtler!
he died of a ſore throat, which in a few days time turned to an inward
mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.—I will ſay no more on the occaſion: very affecting
has it been to me.—God preſerve your life, your happineſs, and your
friendſhips! and may you ever be <hi>aſſured</hi> of <hi>that</hi> with
which I am, dear Sir,</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1250901200:204"/>I am given to underſtand that I may expect
a viſit this ſummer from the Biſhop of Worceſter; from Lord Ward, Lord
Coventry, and Lord Guernſey.—It may be ſo; but honours of <hi>this
ſort,</hi> which would formerly have affected me, perhaps <hi>too</hi>
deeply, have now loſt much of their wonted poignancy. Can <hi>ſuch</hi>
perſons bear to ſee the ſcenes <hi>riant,</hi> and to find the
<hi>owner</hi> gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Let <hi>them,</hi> as they are <hi>able,</hi> make my
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances more affluent; and they ſhall find the <hi>reflection</hi>
in <hi>my</hi> face and in <hi>their</hi> reception; but, as this will never
be, it is no compliment to declare, that an hour or two's interview with you or
Mr. Graves outweighs the arrival of the whole Britiſh Peerage.</p>
               <p>Something elſe I have to ſay. Young Pixell laſt winter told
me, that the organiſt of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter had ſet your Ode (The Blackbirds) to
muſic; that he <hi>liked</hi> the muſic; and that he would ſing it next
evening at the Birmingham concert. I have not heard him mention it
<hi>ſince,</hi> and I <hi>forgot</hi> to enquire; but, if you happen to have
the notes, I ſhould be glad if you would incloſe them for me.</p>
               <p>I have been of late much bent upon the encreaſe of
<hi>horns</hi> in this neighbourhood.—Do not interpret me
<hi>perverſely</hi>; I mean French horns only. My Lord Dudley has had a
perſon to teach two of his ſervants—nothing—at my
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation; but your old acquaintance Maurice, <hi>who lives at the corner
of my coppice,</hi> will exceed him in a week by means of a good ear. I have
borrowed a horn for him. Adieu!</p>

            <p>YOU do me juſtice in believing that I am truly ſorry you have
not been well. A degree or two of regularity more than what you have already
will, I fancy, reſtore your health, and my ſatisfaction; and I beg you will
afford me the earlieſt account of your recovery.</p>
            <p>I conſidered Maſter W—'s viſit as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
engagement, and remained at home in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant expectation of him for a
fortnight together.—I am, however, not ſorry, for his own ſake, that
he is gone to Oxford eſpecially as you ſeem to have an aſſurance of its
proving advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Pray aſſure him of my earneſt wiſhes for his
happineſs, and that The Leaſowes will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at his ſervice,
whenever, through the fickleneſs of human nature, he thinks proper to give up
a Muſe for a Water-nymph.</p>
            <p>I expect Mr. Hylton daily.—He was laſt week in London, and
is now, I believe, at Coventry.—He will probably viſit you before he

            <p>Poſt-woman waits for me, 
<q rend="inline">"multa gemens."</q> Dodſley is the man for your

often lame with the gout, and will hardly be able to make any long

            <p>Your caſe is exactly mine. You ſay you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear wrongs with

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM ſure you muſt be puzzled how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for my ſilence,
after the honour you have done me by your verſes, and the requeſt you made
that I would <hi>write.</hi>—I am alſo as much at a loſs how to give
a proper weight to my apology. To ſay I have been ill, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps imply
too much: when I would only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that ſtate of heavineſs and
dejection which is ſo frequently my lot at this time of the year; and which
renders me both <hi>averſe</hi> to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and utterly diſſatisfied
with every thing that I <hi>do</hi> write.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1250901200:207"/>IF at any time my head grew a little leſs
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed than ordinary, I was obliged to devote my attention to the affair
in which I had ſo <hi>fooliſhly</hi> involved myſelf with Dodſley. You
are unable to conceive what vexation it has given me: I could not endure to
<hi>diſappoint</hi> him: of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it has been my lot to ſtudy the
delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>poetry</hi> when my brain was not ſufficient to indite a
piece of common proſe; but as the <hi>Mouſe</hi> (by which I mean my
<hi>own</hi> performances) will ſo ſoon make its ridiculous appearance, it
were totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labours of the
<hi>Mountain.</hi>—The firſt letter I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you left me
greatly diſſatisfied. I was then to ſend D— my <hi>final</hi>
inſtructions in a poſt or two.—You took little notice of any query I
made; and intimated a diſapprobation which agreed <hi>too well</hi> with my
own internal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. I knew not but you were <hi>angry</hi> at the
<hi>liberties</hi> I had taken; though I could have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed any
ſingle paper which I had then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to London.—Little did I
<hi>then</hi> imagine that it was in my power to have protracted the affair
till <hi>now.</hi> Had that been the caſe, I ſhould have troubled you with
repeated embaſſies; for I abhor the tediouſneſs of the poſt, and my
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do little at this time of the year, that is of more importance than
their maſter's poetry.</p>
            <p>Your next letter convinced me, that you had taken no offence: and
ſo far I was happy; but then I wanted to have your Gold-finches as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
as your Black-birds; there were <hi>ſome</hi> things I wiſhed you to alter;
and others in regard to which I was deſirous to ſpeak my
<hi>ſentiments.</hi> Add to this my own <hi>verſes,</hi> with which I was
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>more</hi> diſſatisfied. Why then did I not write?—The
true reaſon was, that I was preſſed by D— to ſend concluſions
every poſt; and though I have had all this leiſure (as it <hi>happens</hi>)
ſince you wrote, I never could <hi>depend</hi> upon <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1250901200:208"/>
more than the ſpace of a day or two. Beſides, criticiſms in the way of
letter are extremely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and diſſatisfactory; inſomuch, that I am
thoroughly determined never to print any thing for the future, unleſs I have
the company of my friends when I ſend to the preſs Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as I then was,
I ſent up your two copies, and what I propoſed for him of my own, with a
kind of <hi>diſcretionary</hi> power to ſelect the beſt readings. How you
would approve of this meaſure I knew not; but I had this to plead in my
behalf, that D— was a perſon of taſte <hi>himſelf</hi>; that he
had, as I imagined, many learned friends to aſſiſt him; that his
<hi>intereſt</hi> was concerned in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Miſcellany; and
that I ſubmitted my own pieces to the ſame judgement.</p>
            <p>After all, I am but indifferently ſatisfied with the preſent
ſtate of theſe contributions. D— writes juſt ſo much as he deems
<hi>neceſſary</hi> in the way of buſineſs, and paſſes by a
thouſand points in my letters which deſerve an anſwer. His laſt
acquaints me, that he has ſpent a whole day in the arrangement of what I have
ſent him; and that he purpoſes to ſend me <hi>proof-ſheets</hi> before
the cloſe of this week, deſiring I would ſend them back by the return of
the poſt. Whether they arrive on Saturday or on Monday, I can keep them till
the Thurſday following.</p>
            <p>And this brings me, in the laſt place, to the main purpoſe of
this letter.—It is a requeſt on which I lay great ſtreſs; and which
you muſt not refuſe me upon almoſt any conſideration.—I beg, in
ſhort, that you would promiſe me the favour of your company on Monday (or
even Tueſday next, if poſſible; and let us jointly fix the readings of
<hi>your</hi> pieces, of my <hi>own,</hi> and thoſe of our common
<hi>friends.</hi>—You will immediately comprehend the <hi>expediency</hi>
of this; now, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that our names are to appear. <hi>Some</hi>
alterations I think <hi>neceſſary</hi> in your Gold-finches, 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1250901200:209"/> and there are two or three ſtanzas which I think you
might improve.—Nevertheleſs, I will not pretend that this journey is
ſo <hi>requiſite</hi> upon your <hi>own</hi> account as <hi>mine</hi>; and
will recommend it upon no other footing than the pleaſure you will receive by
the obligation which you will confer.</p>
            <p>I thought to have concluded here; but, as an envelope is now become
altogether neceſſary, have a temptation to proceed which I did not ſee
before.</p>
            <p>It is now become Friday the twenty-fourth of January. The packets I
ſend, and the requeſt that I make upon ſo <hi>little</hi> warning, will,
at firſt, aſtoniſh you.—Unforeſeen interruptions would not
ſuffer me to diſpatch my courier ſooner.—What then remains, but
that I endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt this affair agreeably to its <hi>preſent</hi>
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?</p>
            <p>You will readily conceive from what you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in my packets,
how deſireable your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is to me at this juncture. Suppoſing it then
in your <hi>power</hi> to come over on Monday, Tueſday, or even Wedneſday,
I am inclined to believe you <hi>will.</hi> Suppoſing it <hi>not</hi> ſo, I
can foreſee you will not have leiſure to ſatisfy my queries by the return
of the bearer; and what I would <hi>next</hi> propoſe is, that you would
either ſuffer me to ſend again to you betwixt this time and Thurſday
next; or that you would yourſelf diſpatch a purpoſe-meſſenger, and
allow me to pay for his journey.—In either of theſe <hi>latter</hi>
caſes, I am ſure you ſo well know the nature of my preſent
irreſolution, that you will endeavour to afford me all the aſſiſtance
you are able.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I RECEIVED a letter from Dodſley, dated the fifteenth of February;
informing me that you were then in town, had been with him, and left your
directions whether he might ſend you a ſet of Miſcellanies.</p>
            <p>February the twentieth, and not <hi>before,</hi> arrived young
H— with your letter; very obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to give me previous notice
of your journey; but which, by the iniquity of chance, tended only to acquaint
me with an opportunity which I had <hi>loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing could have been ſo fortunate as your journey to
London, had Mr. H— thought proper to bring your letter in due
time.—What excuſe he made for his neglect, or whether he made any, I
have really forgot. This I know, that the whole affair has been unlucky. There
has been abundant time for conſultation, and a perfect ſeries of
opportunities of which we have not been ſuffered to avail
ourſelves.—It is now three weeks or a month ſince I corrected the
proof-ſheets; was ſo hurried in the doing of it that I ſcarce knew what I
wrote; and yet, in ſpite of all this hurry, the book is hitherto
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed. <hi>Now,</hi> indeed, it muſt be much too late for
alterations, as D— has given me ſome room to expect a book this very
day.—I know but little what he has done in conſequence of that
diſcretionary power with which I, through haſte, was obliged to intruſt
him: but in what I have done, <hi>myſelf,</hi> you may expect to find all the
effects of <hi>dulneſs precipitated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is now the twenty-third of February, and I have received no
freſh account of our friend <pb n="192" facs="tcp:1250901200:211"/> Dodſley's proceedings;
nor am I able to <hi>trace</hi> them, as I expected, in the news-papers.</p>
            <p>As to your ſhare of this Miſcellany, you can have no cauſe to
be diſſatisfied.—After what manner he has thought proper to print
Lady L—'s verſes, I am a good deal uncertain; but I apprehend he has
not followed her own read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings very preciſely, and that the blame thereof is
to be thrown upon me.—I am concerned for the memory of my poor friend
Whiſtler; and regret that his <hi>better</hi> pieces did not fall into my
hands. I think that Dodſley, however, would have done him greater juſtice,
had he inſerted his tranſlation of 
<q rend="inline">"Horace and Lydia."</q> It is true, the
tranſlations of that Ode are out of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but <hi>his,</hi> if I miſtake
not, had many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of its own.—I do not know whether I ever hinted
to you, that <hi>his</hi> genius and that of Ovid were apparently
congenial.—Had he cultivated his with equal care, perhaps the
ſimilitude had been as obvious as that of your twin-daughters.—Mr.
Graves has one ſmall well-poliſhed gem in this collection; his verſes
upon medals.—His little conjugal Love-ſong is alſo natural and
eaſy.—I <hi>told</hi> you what I leaſt diſliked of my <hi>own</hi>
puerilities.—If the printing of my Rural Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be
<hi>invidious,</hi> it was altogether owing to the inſtigation of Sir
G— L—. There are four or five little matters, which, if he have
printed with my name, incorrect as they are, I ſhall be utterly
diſconſolate; at leaſt, till I get ſight of a ſucceeding
impreſſion.—For though I am not much ſolicitous about a poetical
reputation (and indeed it is of little importance to ſo <hi>domeſtic</hi>
an animal as myſelf), yet I could ill endure to paſs for an affected,
powerleſs <hi>pretender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now no more upon the ſubject.—I have nothing to add that
can the leaſt amuſe you.—You, who have been converſant with all the
buſy and the ſplendid ſcenes of life, can want <pb n="193" facs="tcp:1250901200:212"/> no
materials to make a letter entertaining.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you never
<hi>did.</hi>—I ſhall be glad, however, to receive a <hi>long</hi> one,
upon what ſubjects you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I have paſſed a very dull and unamuſive win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; my health
indeed rather better than I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced it laſt year; but my head
<hi>as</hi> confuſed, and my ſpirits <hi>as</hi> low. I live in hopes of an
opportunity of ſeeing you at Harbury; but I begin now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive viſits as
an honeſt beggar does an alms, with my humbleſt thanks for the favour, and
with a deſpair of making a return.</p>
            <p>Perhaps my next letter may diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more
<hi>reſolution:</hi> inclinations I never want; being at all times with
ſingular affection yours.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE ſo long expected the favour of a few lines from you, that I
begin at laſt to queſtion whether you received the letter I ſent you. It
was incloſed in one to Mr. M—, whom I requeſted to further it with
all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient expedition. I am neither able to recollect the whole contents
of it; nor indeed, if I <hi>were,</hi> could I endure the thoughts of
tranſcribing them. The chief intention of it, however, was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you
of Mr. H—'s unhappy delay in the delivery of that letter with which you
favoured me from Radway.</p>
            <p>What confirms me in a ſuſpicion that my laſt letter
miſcarried, is, that Mr. Wren lately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me of your being at Wroxall
upon bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and of your making ſome ſlight mention

you diſcovered any deſign you had of writing to me. This is mere preamble
and ſtuff: implying nothing more than the deſire I have to <hi>hear</hi>
from you, when it ought alſo to expreſs how impatiently I long to
<hi>ſee</hi> you. Worldly concerns and my winterly ſtate of health have
detained me at home for theſe many months paſt; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns may have
confined you likewiſe; but as your health and ſpirits are univerſally
better than mine, and as you have much leſs diſlike to travelling than
myſelf, I would hope that my abſence from Harbury will never cauſe you to
<hi>neglect</hi> any <hi>opportunity</hi> of coming hither. For my own part, I
have been meditating upon a viſit to you all this winter; and do, at this
time, reſolve moſt ſtrenuouſly to perform it before June. But the many
ſuch ſchemes of pleaſure in which I have been diſappointed are a ſort
of check upon my expreſſions, and make me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with <hi>fear.</hi> As
to Dodſley's performance, which you muſt have received before this time, I
will make no obſervations till I have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing you: and
yet there are many points I would diſcuſs, and many accounts I want to give
you. So many indeed, that they would furniſh out perhaps a ſuperficial
drawling letter; but would ſerve infinitely better for converſation, with
the book before us. The volume, I am told, is well received in town; though
political intelligence muſt engroſs much of its preſent attention.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hylton is in my neighbourhood, and upon the point of ſettling
at his farm. Could you poſſibly ſpend a week with us, we would try to
make it agreeable. At all events, I beg to hear from you; and that, not merely
as it will afford me great pleaſure, but as, at the ſame time, it will
eaſe me of ſome ſolicitude. I will not make this a long letter, though I
wiſh to receive a long <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1250901200:216"/> one in return; having a head
very little quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to add any thing that may amuſe you, though a heart

            <p>THOUGH the ſilence that has prevailed for ſo long a time betwixt
us be. I fear, to be placed to <hi>my</hi> account, yet do I by no means
imagine, that you will deſire me to fill half this letter with apologies.
Suffice it, that I owe all the world, at this time, either letters, viſits,
or money: yet that my <hi>heart</hi> is as well diſpoſed in each of theſe
reſpects, as that of any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is inſolvent. The regard indeed
that I owe to you has been a troubleſome inmate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my boſom for ſome
time paſt; making daily remonſtrances againſt the injuſtice which I
have done it; and urging me ſtrenuouſly to take horſe, and make my
<hi>perſonal</hi> apologies at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.—I return you many thanks for
Mr. S—'s company, and for the ſight of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript which he
ſhewed me. Alas! that I cannot ſpare money to drain and to improve my
lands, or to put almoſt any part of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rules in execution! and
yet that Mr. Childe of Kinlett (hearing my place always termed a farm) ſhould
come expecting to find all things managed here according to the perfection of
<hi>huſbandry!</hi> As little <hi>can</hi> I pretend to improve Mr.
S—'s treatiſe, as his treatiſe <hi>will</hi> my farm: no farther at
<hi>moſt,</hi> than in what regards the <hi>ſtile,</hi> or <hi>plan</hi> of
his performance. Yet could I wiſh <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1250901200:217"/> to ſee both
<hi>it</hi> and <hi>him</hi> again before he prints it; wiſhing him all the
ſucceſs which his very <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> deſerves. Aſſuredly the
preſent is not the <hi>time</hi> for his publication: more <hi>immediate</hi>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies than can be derived from agriculture are become abſolutely
requiſite to relieve the ſufferings of this nation.—I ſhould be
extremely well-pleaſed to viſit you at Harbury, but cannot even propoſe
to myſelf that happineſs at <hi>preſent</hi>; and were I even to
<hi>promiſe,</hi> have but too much reaſon to know the <hi>uncertainty</hi>
of my <hi>performance.</hi> Yet am I ſenſible enough we <hi>ought to
meet,</hi> if we purpoſe that what we print ſhould have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of
our mutual criticiſms. Let me then <hi>conjure</hi> you to come over, at your

<hi>general</hi> points, and make no worſe a figure in the future
Miſcellany, than we have done in the foregoing<note n="*" place="bottom">See
the Edinburgh Review, No. 1.</note>.—But I have really more things to
<hi>ſay</hi> than I will pretend to <hi>ſcrawl</hi> upon <hi>paper</hi>;
nor can I endure to retail a few particulars, while I am impatient to
communicate the whole.</p>
            <p>Let me acquaint you while I remember, that there is at this time a
Mr. Duncombe and his ſon, clergymen, that are publiſhing a new
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Horace. Whatever you may think of their <hi>ſucceſs,</hi>
after <hi>Francis,</hi> I believe I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them men of real merit, and
in no wiſe deſtitute of learning or genius. They have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted me to

either of my own or of any friends; wherefore, it you <hi>have</hi> any thing
of this fort, I ſhould be glad if you would put it in my power to oblige
them. The ſon has an

            <p>Under the head of intelligence, I have mighty little to

that he means for you ſhould remain here till your arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; or if you
chuſe that I ſhould ſend it by the Birmingham-ſtage to Bath. Having
made this enquiry, I was thinking to conclude; but cannot reconcile myſelf to
the <hi>novelty</hi> of ſending <hi>you</hi> three empty pages. The
Parliament will <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1250901200:219"/> riſe too ſoon for the publication of
my 
<q rend="inline">"Rural Elegance;"</q> and having performed my
promiſe to Dodſley, I think no more about ſuch <hi>laurels</hi> as the
<hi>public</hi> can beſtow upon me, but am giving all my attention to ſuch
as I can purchaſe of my nurſery-man. I wiſh, however, that the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
may recompenſe Dodſley for his trouble: I may alſo add, for his
ingenuity, and for his politeneſs in giving each of us a compleat ſett.
They are elegantly bound, and all as much alike as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The preſent criſis of ſtate-affairs does not ſeem to favour
his publication, as the attention of the public muſt lean greatly to that
quarter. I ſaw a letter from Sir William M— (who correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds with
Lady Luxborough) which placed the ſtruggles of the miniſtry in a clearer
light than they had yet appeared to me. It ſeems that perſons of all
denominations are for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the war with vigour; and the King's
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for a Vote of Credit was received with general approbation. The
zeal of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was indeed ſo remarkable on this occaſion, that,
inſtead of the 600,000<hi>l.</hi> at firſt intended, it was thought proper
to propoſe a million. But the ſervices were aſcertained, and the
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Exchequer made accountable for the application of it. The
augmentation of the fleet with 20,000 ſeamen; the raiſing 5000 ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines on
a plan of dividing them into ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, which will render them more
uſeful both by ſea and land; the completion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of the
Iriſh regiments; are the uſes to which this million is to be appropriated.
Mr. Fox and his land-war party ſat mute, whilſt Mr. Legge with great
openneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity explained the preſent ſchemes; as they were
calculated, to exert our whole ſtrength at ſea, and, if poſſible, no
where elſe. Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, who, it ſeems, has not ſpoke for many years,
charmed every body. His wit did not <pb n="199" facs="tcp:1250901200:220"/> only entertain, but
animate and affect his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 
<q rend="inline">"It were better, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> than loſe the
domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ocean, that the Ocean ſhould overwhelm us: for what Briton
could wiſh to leave a poſterity crawling upon this iſland, only to feel
the tyranny, and ſwell the victories, of France?"</q> It ſeems, F—,
in his oppoſition to the Duke of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, is ſupported by the Duke of
Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, his army, and the Scotch: that the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (or the D. of
N—'s party) ſeem not diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a proſpect of uniting with
the Tories, who now hold the balance; and it ſeems the Tories, by Sir

Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>You will gueſs that good part of this political account is

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably this, however, is not the laſt ſeal that I ſhall cauſe this

it does not quite ſatisfy me.—I will incloſe the two laſt letters I
received from Mr. Dodſley; but you muſt not think I build too much upon any
compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he there makes me.—It is true, I think him a very
ſincere man; but he cannot have been converſant ſo long with
modern-writers, but he muſt conjecture, when their piece is publiſhed, that
they a little hunger for applauſe. I am now uncertain whether you will
receive a letter from him; as he has, unaccountably I think, ſent your books

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE paſſed a very dull and unamuſive winter here—the
worſe, for being neither <hi>diſpoſed</hi> nor <hi>qualified</hi> to keep
up a correſpondence with my friends; with <hi>you,</hi> among the
<hi>chief</hi>; and yet, it is upon you that I muſt depend to make up my
deficiencies with Mr. Dodſley.—The poor man has been afflicted with the
moſt <hi>laſting</hi> fit of the gout he ever underwent before.—His
patience, on theſe occaſions, is inimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His excurſion to the
<hi>Regions of Terror and Pity</hi> is not the only inſtance of his ability
to compoſe verſes in the midſt of pain. When he ſent me a copy of it,
he let me know, that he had tranſmitted another to you by the ſame poſt.
I ſhould be glad to receive your remarks upon it, ere I communicate my own. I
have, for <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1250901200:223"/> ſome weeks paſt, ſound my head ſo
terribly confuſed, that it has been with difficulty I could <hi>think</hi> or
<hi>expreſs</hi> myſelf on the moſt ſuperficial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic. I hope, in a
little time, to be able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it more attentively than I can at
preſent: yet, in the mean while, muſt acknowledge, that I think his
ſubject capable of furniſhing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary beauties for an Ode: and
<hi>ſuch,</hi> I think, he ſhould <hi>call</hi> it; dropping the narrative
parts, and the connexions as much as poſſible. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wiſh him to
print it without very <hi>material</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations; and what would occaſion
almoſt the ſame trouble as it would require to <hi>new-write</hi> it. I do
not mean this as a condemnation of what he has already done; ſo much, as a
proof of my opinion how much he will he able to improve it. <hi>After all,</hi>
it will ſcarce affect me half ſo ſo much as his Tragedy. He is ſo
<hi>honeſt</hi> a man, that the work he has to give the world is much better
than the ſpecimen: or to borrow an idea from <hi>my ſituation,</hi> the
grain that he has to deliver will prove much better than the ſample. It is
with ſhame I acknowledge I have not yet ſent him his epilogue; and I feel
the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of mind upon this ſcore, as it is poſſible he
may impute my neglect to Garrick's refuſal of his play. This weighs nothing
with you or me; a thouſand motives may affect a manager, that have little or
nothing to do with the merit of the performance; yet he may ſo far thank Mr.
Garrick, that whatever his refuſal takes from the <hi>reputation</hi> of his
Tragedy, it will, through Dodſley's induſtry, add apparently to its value.
I have not yet been able to ſatisfy myſelf with every part of your
epilogue, and muſt either omit ſending it at preſent, or muſt ſend
him an imperfect copy. If you write to him, let me beg you to give the moſt
favourable account you <hi>can</hi> of me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:1250901200:224"/>Somebody acquainted me (I think it was Mr.
Talbot,) that your old friend Ballard had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed you his coins for a
legacy. I was truly glad to hear it; but have wondered ſince, that you never
once informed me of ſo conſiderable an acquiſition.</p>
            <p>I remember a poem of yours, called —, upon the preſent
taſte in gardening; which you will not wonder if my late, employments make me
wiſh once more to ſee. Be ſo kind as to ſend me a copy of this, as well
as of any other little pieces that you have in your bureau. Some of yours
deſerve a better place than what is aſſigned them in the Magazine. In
particular, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that upon Enigmas, and Mopſy. Be aſſured, I will
make no <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>any</hi> without your previous conſent. You
know, I ſuppoſe, that Dodſley's other Miſcellanies do not appear before
next winter.—I have received from him, together with his Ode, a few
Elegies publiſhed by Mr. Whitehead. They are, I think, worth your peruſal;
and deſigned by my worthy friend to excite my emulation. Alas! that I am ſo
ill able to deſerve the encouragements which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him!</p>
            <p>My neighbour Baſkerville, at the cloſe of this month publiſhes
his fine edition of Virgil. It will, for <hi>type</hi> and <hi>paper,</hi> be a
perfect curioſity. He follows the Cambridge edition.</p>
            <p>What think you of their management in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Mr. Byng? I cannot
help thinking the King ſhould <hi>pardon</hi> him. The Court-martial, by
acquitting him of cowardice or diſaffection, have left no <hi>motive</hi> for
his <hi>negligence,</hi> beſide an <hi>error of his judgement;</hi> for we
<hi>cannot</hi> impute it to <hi>ſupineneſs, indifference,</hi> or
<hi>inattention.</hi> And then to ſentence a man for error, is to expect

            <p>WHAT remarks I had to make upon our friend Dodſley's Ode, I ſent
him the laſt poſt. I would gladly have occaſioned them to paſs by
Claverton; but, having delayed them ſo long, I was impatient to convince him
that I had not <hi>wholly</hi> diſregarded his requeſt. They are indeed
pretty copious; and yet I have reſerved to myſelf the privilege of
re-criticiſing when I ſee his altered copy. I recommended to him the
addition which you propoſed, and ſome others; and if he will but take the
pains that I have chalked out for him, I doubt not that he will render it an
excellent Ode, though he may not find it a very <hi>popular</hi> one. I have
alſo ſent him a copy of our epilogue, not much different from what you
ſaw; to theſe I added my little Ode on Lady Luxborough's furniſhing her
libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Perry's Verſes upon the Malvern-waters. At the cloſe of
theſe laſt, there appears (with Perry's approbation,) a ſhort addreſs
to Dr. Wall of Worceſter; a very eminent phyſician, and the patron of this
mineral, who has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted a ſubſcription in the county towards
<hi>building,</hi> near this well, for the accommodation of ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>I purpoſe alſo to give Dodſley the little Ode I incloſe, and
would beg the favour of you to <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1250901200:226"/> adviſe me concerning
the additional ſtanzas' fix the readings in the reſt, and to return me the
copy.</p>
            <p>I come now to analyze your remark on Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard's legacy; which is
indeed very ingenious, but will ſcarce bear examination: nor do I think that
you rather wiſh to have <hi>found</hi> that ſet of medals, than to have
them <hi>given</hi> you by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend. Aſſuredly, if we do not
allow pleaſure to be <hi>predominant</hi> in this kind of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, we
deſtroy the foundation of all tragic or elegiac writings. Melpomene has no
place amongſt the Muſes; and the pains that we have taken with our friend
Dodſley's penſive Ode have been employed to no purpoſe. But you want not
theſe pedantic flouriſhes, and are wholly of my mind.</p>
            <p>Martin's Magazine is, I believe, pretty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; and I wonder
where you got a ſight of it. It was, however, fortunate enough for
<hi>me</hi> that you gave no copy of 
<q rend="inline">"James Dawſon."</q> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſaw your
verſes <hi>on that Grotto,</hi> or from <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> and I want to
ſee your W— once more, concerning which you are ſilent. Your 
<q rend="inline">"Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-box"</q> and 
<q rend="inline">"Mopſy"</q> might, I think, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Dodſley's

a copy of your verſes upon Riddles; and whenever you have a leiſure hour,
ſhould be glad if you would look them out and ſend them.</p>
            <p>Go, and think yourſelf an happy man; at leaſt, if your children
be recovered, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think they are; and give my ſervice to

to take away in ſummer, and which the ſtate of my winter health and
ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits renders me but ill able to reviſe. I believe, I am, even now, the
principal cauſe that his two volumes remain yet unpubliſhed; nor can I
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the pain it gives me, to be thus detrimental to his intereſts; and
to delay the publication of ſo much better pieces than my own. I am alſo
diſſatisfied upon <hi>another ſcore;</hi> I mean, that I have been
wanting to myſelf, in not aſking the benefit of your advice; which I have
heretofore experienced to be at once ſo <hi>comfortable</hi> and ſo
<hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous</hi>; but although the ſcheme was project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſummer,
the buſineſs of correction was (by <hi>me</hi> at leaſt) deferred till

Nevertheleſs, the occaſion of this preſent letter is quite of another

a conſiderable eminence in fruit-pieces, &amp;c. He has been employed by Lord
Lyttelton, and is much admired at Oxford; for my own part, I believe you will
think he is in few reſpects inferior to, and has (if I am not miſtaken)
ſome advantages of, Stranover; but you will ſee his pieces. All I have to

<hi>you</hi>; but its advances were ſo precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, when I ſent for the
phyſicians, that I ſoon received a <hi>wrench</hi> from every object of
this world; and it was by ſlow degrees, even after my recovery, that my mind
took ſo much root again, as appears neceſſary for its immediate
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. I ſuppoſe you have been informed that my fever was in great
meaſure hypochondriacal; and left my nerves ſo extremely ſenſible,
that, even on no very intereſting ſubject, I could readily think myſelf
into a vertigo: I had almoſt ſaid an epilepſy; for ſurely I was
oftentimes near it.—It became, therefore, expedient for my recovery, to
amuſe myſelf with a ſucceſſion of the moſt trivial objects I could
find; and this kind of careleſſneſs I have indulged till it is grown into
an habit. Even letters to my friends are hardly conſiſtent with my rule of
health; <pb n="209" facs="tcp:1250901200:230"/> yet I could be no longer ſilent with regard to
<hi>you,</hi> without feeling a ſenſation that would hurt me <hi>more.</hi>
This may fairly enough be termed the firſt <hi>letter</hi> I have wrote
ſince my recovery; wherein if I ſhould tell you one half that I am inclined
to do, relating to this dreadful illneſs, what room ſhould I then leave to
ſpeak on any other ſubject? I muſt, therefore, tell theſe things by
word of mouth, or write them ſome other time. The journies which my friends,
and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed phyſicians, propoſe for me, are what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bid faireſt
for the completion of my cure: yet there are many, many things, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
unfit for the taſk, I muſt endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt before I can leave home,
with any poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of enjoyment. Need I mention any other than my
curſed embarraſſment with D—? who, during my <hi>danger,</hi> was
induced to ſtop proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but is now beginning law afreſh, and, by the
removal of tenants from <hi>his</hi> ſhare of the Harborough eſtate, has
now wriggled himſelf into poſſeſſion of almoſt one half of
<hi>mine.</hi> However, I am not without hopes of ſeeing all terminated in a
little time; nor entirely without a proſpect of ſeeing you at Claverton
this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. That you may think this the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I am preſſed by
two young gentlemen, whom I very much eſteem to accompany them on a viſit
to Mr. Bamfylde in Somerſetſhire. Theſe two gentlemen are Mr. Dean and
Mr. Knight. Perhaps you may have heard of Mr. Bamfylde, who is very much at
Bath; is there now with his lady, or has left the place but lately; and whoſe
fortune, perſon, figure, and accompliſhments, can hardly leave him long
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed in any place where he reſides. Yet my viſit to Eſtercomb
muſt be of ſecondary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to me, whilſt you live by the
road-ſide. I am much obliged to you for your compliment on my Poematia in
Dodſley's Miſcellanies; <pb n="210" facs="tcp:1250901200:231"/> which came very
ſeaſonably, conſidering how I had been mortified by the firſt ſight
of what was done. To ſpeak the truth, there are many things appear there very
contrary to my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but which I am more deſirous may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the unſeaſonableneſs of my fever, than to my friend D—'s
precipitation. My purpoſe was to acknowledge as <hi>mine,</hi> none of the
pieces which now follow the longer Ode to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Luxborough. Her name was
actually eraſed; as alſo my own at the cloſe of your Fable. The verſes
by Mrs. Bennet to Mr. Richardſon were abſolutely new to me; were my name
occurs again. All this is againſt me; as a thing in itſelf invidious to
have one's name recur ſo often, and as my <hi>own lines contradict</hi> the
merit which my friends ſo liberally allow me.—The verſes of mine in
the ſixth volume (which was printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fifth) were printed without
my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and when I ſent up an improved copy, it arrived a good deal
too late. As things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, I am made to own ſeveral things of inferior
merit to thoſe which I <hi>do not</hi> own—All this is againſt me;
but my thoughts are avocated from this edition, and wholly fixed upon a future;
wherein, I hope, Dodſley will be prevailed upon to omit ſome things alſo
from <hi>other</hi> hands which diſcredit his collection: and, to balance
<hi>all my diſcomforts</hi> on this head, the world will know that I am
eſteemed by a perſon, whom I eſteem ſo much as you.—I know not
how it happens, but the taſte for humorous poetry does not prevail at this
time: yet I cannot agree with Mr. J. Warton, that it is no poetry <hi>at
all,</hi> any more than that a good repreſentation of Dutch boors is not a
picture.—His brother, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, is to be here with his pupil
Lord Done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, &amp;c. this ſummer.—Mr. Spence and Mr. Dodſley will
ſtay a day or two here this month in their way to Scotland; and Mr. Home, the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1250901200:232"/> author of Douglas, &amp;c. called on me and we ſpent
an evening together at Admiral Smith's. Thus my <hi>ferme ornée</hi>
procures me interviews with perſons whom it might otherwiſe be my
<hi>wiſh,</hi> rather than my good fortune to ſee. Would to God, it could
attract <hi>you,</hi> whom I more long to ſee than any one! and let me tell
you, there were conſiderable additions made to it laſt year: Dodſley's
preſent of Faunus; a new Gothic-building, or rather a ſkreen, which coſt
ten pounds; and the ruins of a Priory, which, however, make a tenant's houſe,
that pays me tolerable poundage.—I am growing a little into <hi>your</hi>
taſte, why ſhould not you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance farther into <hi>mine?</hi> I mean, I
have a love for medals, by means of ſome that have been given me: yet do not
think that I ſhall ever ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. <hi>you.</hi>—My object is only
<hi>beauty,</hi> and I love only thoſe of exquiſite workmanſhip: ſo
that this is no more a rivalſhip than that of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who admire the
ſex, but love different individuals; a rivalſhip, which, I truſt, is more
likely to cement our friendſhip than diſunite us; which it is my
<hi>conviction</hi> and my <hi>comfort</hi> no <hi>ſort</hi> of rivalſhip
will ever do. I have hardly room to expreſs my good wiſhes for long health
and happineſs to Mrs. Graves and your little family, and to ſubſcribe

            </opener>
            <p>IT gives me great anxiety when I reflect how long I have waited for
the ſatisfaction of a line from you. I beg, if you are alive and well, you
will let me know ſo by the next poſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dodſley and Mr. Spence have been here and ſtayed a week with
me. The former was in certain hopes of ſeeing you in town; but I do not find
that he either ſaw or heard from you, which <hi>adds</hi> to my anxiety.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen few whom I liked ſo much, upon ſo little
acquaintance, as Mr. Spence; extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly polite, friendly, chearful, and
maſter of an infinite fund of ſubjects for agreeable converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had
my affairs permitted me, they had certainly drawn me with them into Scotland;
whither they are gone, for about a month, upon a journey of curioſity.</p>
            <p>I believe it will give you pleaſure to hear that my law-ſuit
with D— is accommodated, by the generous interpoſition of my Lord
Stamford; concerning whoſe benevolence and magnanimity it is impoſſible
for me to ſpeak in the terms which they deſerve. It is ended, I hope, not
very <hi>diſadvantageouſly</hi> for me; apparently with <hi>one</hi>
advantage, of being intirely exculpated in the opinion of all mankind. The
common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod (as M. Bruyere obſerves) is to condemn <hi>both</hi> on
theſe occaſions.—This ſuits people's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, and favours their
impartiality.—And though the equitableneſs of my whole conduct in this
affair was ſelf-evident to all that were near me, yet I found many that were
inclined to blame us <hi>both,</hi> and <hi>ſome</hi> that I could never
convince till <hi>now</hi> that the fault was not <hi>wholly</hi> mine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1250901200:234"/>Your 
<q rend="inline">"Pepper-box and Salt-ſeller"</q> are in one of the
Chronicles.—They pillage Dodſley's two laſt volumes of all that is
worth peruſal.—I ſurely have ſome friend amongſt the writers of
the Monthly Review; for I have not only eſcaped a flogging, but am treated
with great civility.</p>
            <p>I never know how to leave off, when I begin writing to you, having
always a great deal to ſay. I only purpoſed you a few lines, to deſire
you would write directly. Pray make my beſt compliments to Mrs. Graves, and
believe me ever yours moſt invariably.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE had daily expectations of a line from you theſe two months;
conſcious, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that I did not deſerve any; and affording a manifeſt
inſtance of of the infatuations of ſelf-love. The laſt letter that I
received of yours is dated the cloſe of July, ſince which time I have been
chiefly engaged in my cuſtomary amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; embelliſhing my farm, and
receiving the company that came to ſee it. My principal
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions</hi> have been to Enville, on Lord Grey's birth-day; to Lord
Ward's, upon another invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and to the Worceſter Muſic-meeting. I
need not mention what an appearance there was of company at Worceſter;
dazzling enough, you may ſuppoſe, to a perſon who, like me, has not
ſeen a public place theſe ten years. Yet I made a ſhift to enjoy the
ſplendour, as well as <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1250901200:235"/> the muſic that was prepared
for us. I preſume, nothing in the way of harmony can paſſibly go further
than the Oratoria of The Meſſiah. It ſeems the beſt compoſer's beſt
compoſition. Yet I fancied I could obſerve <hi>ſome parts</hi> in it,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Handel's judgment failed him; where the muſic was not equal, or was
even <hi>oppoſite,</hi> to what the words required. Very many of the
nobleſſe, whom I had ſeen at The Leaſowes, were as complaiſant to me
as poſſible; whereas it was my <hi>former</hi> fate, in public places, to
be as little regarded as a journeyman ſhoe-maker.—There I firſt ſaw
our preſent Biſhop; alſo our late Biſhop's monument, which is
fine.—Laſtly, there I firſt ſaw my Lady Coventry; to whom, I
believe, one muſt allow all that the world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in point of
beauty.—She is certainly the moſt <hi>unexceptionable</hi> figure of a
woman I ever ſaw; and made moſt of the ladies there ſeem of almoſt
another <hi>ſpecies.</hi> On the whole, I was not a little pleaſed that I
had made this excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and returned with double reliſh to the
<hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of my <hi>farm.</hi> It is now high time to take ſome
notice of your obliging letter.—I think I was not told the purport of the
journey you made to London; ſo can only ſay, I am very ſorry for the
aggravating circumſtances of your diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and hope, long before
this time, that Mrs. Graves is quite recovered.—Did I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to make
your excuſes to Dodſley or no?—he was here (as I remember) ſoon
after, with Mr. Spence, in their way to Scotland.—Mr. Spence, the man
<hi>you</hi> would like, and who would like <hi>you</hi> of all mankind. He
took my Elegies into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſent them back on his return, with a
ſheet or two of criticiſms, and an handſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—How much am I
intereſted in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his friendſhip;—and yet ſuch
is my <hi>deſtiny</hi> (for I can give it no other name.) I have never wrote
to him <hi>ſince.</hi> This <hi>impartiality</hi> of <pb n="215" facs="tcp:1250901200:236"/>
my neglect, you muſt accept <hi>yourſelf</hi> as <hi>ſome</hi> apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy:
but to proceed; Mr. Spence choſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an oak here for a ſeat, which I

            <p>I abſolutely <hi>forgot</hi> to talk to Dodſley about your
—, and I am vexed; becauſe I could, with a ſafe conſcience, have
raiſed his idea of your abilities.—However, it is not too late, even if
you care to publiſh it this winter—His play comes on (I fancy, <hi>this
very night</hi>) at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-garden. What he ſays in behalf of this ſtep is,
that there was no glimpſe of probability, that Garrick would ever admit it at
the other houſe<note n="†" place="bottom">He ſays, the players liked
it, and ſeemed inclined to take

his Cleone, and ſpeaks the epilogue, of which more anon. I ſuppoſe he
acts by Lord Cheſterfield's opinion: for I know, when he was going to print
it (ſince he came home) with a <hi>proper</hi> dedication to Mr. Garrick, my
Lord then prevented him, telling him, it <hi>would</hi> be acted one day or
other.—Did I ever ſend you a copy of the epilogue, with all the
additions and alterations? Dodſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley firſt liked, then diſliked it, and
laſtly liked it again; only deſiring me to ſoften the ſatire, ſhorten
the whole (for it was upwards of ſixty lines,) and add a complimentary
cloſe to the <hi>boxes.</hi>—All this I have endeavoured, and ſent it
him laſt Monday.—<hi>You</hi> would not care to own it: and he would
fain have <hi>me</hi>; but I think <pb n="216" facs="tcp:1250901200:237"/> neither of us
ſhould run the riſque, where ſo little honour is to be acquired; yet Mr.
Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth's name to the prologue is an inducement.—I was very near
ſurprizing you at Claverton this autumn, with my friend young Knight, in his
way to Mr. Bamfylde's; but he goes <hi>again</hi> in ſpring, and I ſhall
certainly accompany him; I have <hi>beſpoke,</hi> but not yet
<hi>procured</hi> any, horſes for my chaiſe. It is a neat one, you will
find; and I have made two or three excurſions in it.—I ſaw Mr.
Patchen's Topographical Letters ſoon after they were publiſhed.—It
you continue to me the honour of a ſhield in your Gothic al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove, the field
ſhould be either 
<q rend="inline">"Or, three King-fiſhers proper,"</q> or with the
addition of a chief gules, three trefoils argent—no bar, cheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron bend,
&amp;c.—More of this when I write again.—Motto FLVMNINA AMEM,
SYLVASQUE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLORIVS—RVRA MIHI.</p>
            <p>I cannot recollect my company of the ſeaſon, to tell it
you.—Sir Francis Daſhwood, Lord Litchfield, and Mr. Sheldon, were here
together in the beginning of the autumn; and I have ſtrong invitations to
viſit them.—I have a very genteel letter from Sir Francis, offering me
gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes; and I have a double inducement to viſit Mr. Sheldon, as he
lives near Mickleton, and is the moſt agreeable man alive.—Your
acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance Lord W— dined and ſpent good part of a day with
me.—Under a ſort of gloomy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a man of admirable ſenſe
and ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.—I put him in mind of you, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
monument at Cambden.—Mr. Thomas Warton was alſo here with Lord Donegal,
and has ſince ſent me his 
<q rend="inline">"Inſcriptions,"</q> which are rather too ſimple,
even for my taſte.—Biſhop of Worceſter with his family and
company—Lord Willoughby—Lord Foley.—I mention Lord Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley the
rather, becauſe I ſhall call on your friend Dr. Charleton (who was alſo
here) to paſs a <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1250901200:238"/> day or two with me at Whitley.—I
ſhall paſs alſo a day or two at our Biſhop's, whom I met ſince at
Enville. Theſe two (<hi>propoſe</hi> what I <hi>will</hi> beſides) will
probably be the principal, or only excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that I ſhall make this
winter.—God ſend it may no more affect my health than it has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
done.—I am at preſent tolerably well, and live more temperately than
before.—Would to God you could come over; go with me to Dr. Charleton's,
and Lord Foley's, and Lord Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's, and paſs a week here! I would meet
you with my chaiſe at Worceſter, or even farther. I have finiſhed a
building oppoſite to the new ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which I think you ſaw.—They
together give my houſe a degree of ſplendour. Did you ſee my
priory?—a tenant's houſe, one room whereof is to have Gothic ſhields
round the cornice.—I am in ſome doubt whether to make it an Houſe of
Lords or Houſe of Commons; if the former, my private friends will have
ſhields round my Gothic bed-chrmber.—The wretch is curſed that
<hi>begins</hi> a letter with no better a pen than I <hi>finiſh</hi> one
with. My dear friend, write directly a long letter.—Keep me alive in the

mean with reſpect to the <hi>ordinary congratulations</hi> on your

neglected ſuch a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. Perhaps I ſhould not have neglected it; but as
I have the ſatisfaction of believing that you would rejoice in any
ſucceſs of mine, <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1250901200:240"/> ſo I hope you would not
diſtruſt my ſentiments upon any change of your condition which you
yourſelf eſteemed for the <hi>better.</hi> I do indeed, my worthy friend,
wiſh you much joy, both <hi>now,</hi> and at <hi>all</hi> times; and you will
ever diſcern it in my face, as often as fortune grants us an
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.—Mr. S— is a benevolent man, and I am ſure would
with-hold no information that tended to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> our friendſhip
on either ſide.</p>
            <p>I have thoughts of proceeding on to Harbury, whenever I come to Mr.
Wren's: as I have long enough made my friend a promiſe; and intend ere long
to do. Many reaſons occur why I cannot ſet forward to-morrow morning: are
theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſubſtantial, or no other than the ſly and
ſophiſtical inſinuations of indolence?—ſurely the former.</p>
            <p>Dodſley, and indeed Mr. Spence, both expect me in town this
February.—I fear it will not <hi>be</hi>; but if it <hi>ſhould,</hi>
how readily would I give notice, and become obliged to you for your

            <p>Though I ſhould have <hi>expected</hi> you would ſelect a

kinds that I am afraid to expatiate upon <hi>any</hi> one article. Cannot you
make a ſhift to call upon <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1250901200:241"/> me, before <hi>my public
life</hi> arrives?—I would ſend my chaiſe to meet you at any place
you ſhould appoint.</p>
            <p>I have paſſed my winter hitherto pretty chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully amongſt my
books, in what I <hi>call</hi> my libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It now better deſerves that name,
by the form I have given it, and the volumes I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.—Mr. S— would
tell you ſomething of my <hi>other</hi> occupations.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh that you would favour me with a copy of your
Eſſay on Electricity, and with any new copy of verſes of your own, or of
your friends.—Be not apprehenſive: there ſhall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more appear
in print of your compoſition, without your explicit conſent.—And yet
I have thoughts of amuſing myſelf with the publication of a ſmall
Miſcellany from neighbour Baſker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's preſs, if I can ſave myſelf
harmleſs as to expence.—I purpoſe it no larger than a 
<q rend="inline">"Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down's," a "Philips's," or a "Pomfret's
Poems."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Have you read my friend Dr. Grainger's Tibul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus?—It affords
you an elegant edition of a good tranſlation and of the text. He is engaged
in a war with S—, and has juſt ſent me his pamphlet; which I could
wiſh you to read, in order to form a judgement of S—'s character.
Spence, I ſee, has advertiſed his 
<q rend="inline">"Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Malliabecqui and his Taylor."</q>
It is mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a charitable deſign: and ſuch are now all Spence's views.</p>
            <p>What remains of my paper muſt be employed not in <hi>mere</hi>
ceremony, although in ſomething that bears the form of it: in my beſt
compliments to Mrs. Jago, and my offer, not indeed of a part of the
friendſhip which I owe you, but rather of an equal quantity: in an
aſſurance of the cordiality with which I ſhall rejoice to ſee both her
and you; and in confirmation of that affection with <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1250901200:242"/>
which I have ever been, and am, my good friend, your moſ obedient

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU will think my ſilence long; and I ſhould be ſorry to
<hi>have</hi> you quite regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of it; although, I fear, it muſt be my
fate to treſpaſs frequently upon your kind ſolicitude.—I have no
excuſe to make, beſides ſome frivolous avocations, and <hi>much</hi> of
that heavineſs and laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which diſinclines one to write
letters.—I paſſed the former part of winter with more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity than
I did the latter, or even the incipient ſpring; owing, poſſibly, to
theſe cold winds, which will not permit me to uſe my wonted exerciſe. You
will laugh at the word <hi>vivacity,</hi> when applied to ſo dull an animal;
but I ſpeak comparatively of that unmeaning drowſineſs which is my lot at
other times, and <hi>was,</hi> in ſome ſort, while you were here.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dodſley tells me, he received a letter from you, acquainting
him that Cleone would be played at Bath: I ſhould be glad to receive from you
any particulars of its ſucceſs. He is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an elegant edition of
it, which I expect by this very poſt. The new plate of my grove, which will
appear at the end of his Melpomene, is perhaps liable to ſome exceptions;
but, by much, the beſt that has yet appeared. Do not forget to ſend me your
objections to it. As to <pb n="222" facs="tcp:1250901200:243"/> the epilogue, I have totally
baniſhed, I think, every one of the lines which he <hi>ſubſtituted</hi>;
have left to him the choice of two or three readings for the four laſt lines;
and though none of them quite pleaſe me, yet the epilogue, on the whole,
diſcovers more of genius, is more ſpirited, and leſs inaccurate. I
ſhall be glad to find that you think the ſame with me.</p>
            <p>In regard to your place, ſo far as I can form an idea of it, I
would have you conſult <hi>ſelf</hi>-amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I mean, without too much
regard to what <hi>others</hi> ſay or think. As to diſtinguiſhing your
ingenuity (which I unfeignedly deſire you may) the preſs affords you more
<hi>adequate</hi> materials than either your fortune or, perhaps, your place.
Do not imagine, however, that I ſhall not be much delighted with every
ſtroke I trace of yours at Claverton. My faculties are very ſtrongly
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive in reſpect of every thing belonging to you: and I ſhould be
aſhamed if any nook or angle that you had rounded; any wall that you had
ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; any ſtream that you had diverted; or any ſingle ſhrub that you
had planted; ſhould elude my diſcovery: yet you will ſhine <hi>more</hi>
by means of the preſs; and if I ſaid any thing concerning your —,
that did not <hi>encourage</hi> you to perfect it, I am ſure, I muſt uſe
terms very inexpreſſive of my meaning. Without any more words, let me
<hi>intreat</hi> you to proceed with it; give a <hi>full ſcope</hi> to your
imagination; and if there ſhould be aught one would wiſh
<hi>retrenched,</hi> it is mighty <hi>eaſily done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have indeed <hi>thoughts</hi> (for I <hi>never</hi> uſe the word
<hi>reſolutions</hi>) of publiſhing my Elegies next winter;—you will
gainſay, when I tell you my intention of publiſhing alſo my very farm; at
leaſt, about eight or ten ſcenes taken from it, by way of top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
tail-pieces for thoſe elegies.—The world will perhaps tax my vanity;
but I do not in the leaſt <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1250901200:244"/> care.—The pleaſure
which that world gives me, I am very conſcious, will not be too
<hi>high</hi>; and I am determined that the pain it may ſeek to give ſhall
bear proportion: yet ſhould I be ſorry to obtrude ſtuff upon it, either
from the pencil or the pen; and my good friend Mr. Dodſley has ſometimes
pained me, not a little.</p>
            <p>I tell you, you <hi>cannot</hi> allow for winter.—That very
ſcene near Priory-gate ſhews not a bit of road in <hi>ſummer</hi>; though
the conſciouſneſs of a firm rail there would add to my own
tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—Mr. Knight has given me Strange's prints, which, I hear,
are fine. Dodſley gives me ſwans; but for theſe two months paſt I have
been a librarian, or rather a bookbinder; yet nothing more
<hi>unfeignedly,</hi> than yours and Mrs. Graves's moſt affectionate humble
ſervant,</p>

            <p>DEPEND upon it, I ſhall ſee Claverton before winter.—The
miſchief is, that, with as violent a propenſity as ever perſon felt, I
ſhall not be able to reach your hemiſphere, while Mr. Spence, Mr.
Dodſley, and Mr. Whitehead give it ſuch peculiar luſtre, in my eyes. This
I did not deſpair of doing at the time Mr. Dodſley left me at Birmingham.
It turned upon an event, which I did not indeed explain to him, the
accommodation of the affair with D—; which concerns near one half of my
little fortune, and which, if I have any luck on my ſide, muſt 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1250901200:245"/> now be perfected within a fortnight. I was ſhewn the
rough ſketch of our <hi>conveyances</hi> laſt Saturday.—Once for all,
my <hi>indolence</hi> is not in fault; my health and my worldly
embarraſſments <hi>have</hi> often been ſo, and at preſent
<hi>are.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"Pol me miſerum, patrone, vocares, ſi verum,

            </p>
            <p>Dodſley, to give his book eclat, ſhould allow himſelf time to
<hi>abridge</hi> and <hi>poliſh.</hi> It is not enough in my opinion, merely
to ſurpaſs L'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trange and Croxall. The grand <hi>exception</hi> to
Fables conſiſts in giving <hi>ſpeech</hi> to animals, &amp;c. a greater
<hi>violation</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> than appears in any other kind of writing!
This objection is inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable. Their peculiar <hi>advantage</hi> is to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the offenſiveneſs of advice; in order to which, one ſhould
perhaps purſue a medium betwixt the ſuperfluous garniture of La Fontaine,
&amp;c. and the naked ſimplicity and laconiſm of Phaedrus. In reſpect of
his own new-invented Fables, I wiſh him to deviſe uncommon ſubjects, and
to inculcate refined morals. But pray ſend me <hi>your</hi> two directly,
which will anſwer all that I expect in Fables.</p>
            <p>Did Mr. Dodſley tell you of the ſeat in my ſhrubbery which I
had taken the freedom to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to you? I could not <hi>ſatisfy</hi>
myſelf in an inſcription; and, from a kind of ſpleen and averſion to
delay, made uſe of the ſhorteſt that I could deviſe. The ſeat and
ſcroll are elegant. The inſcription, only,

            <p>I will not be ſo affected as to pretend that the much greater

is pleaſing to my <pb n="225" facs="tcp:1250901200:246"/> friendſhip. I wiſh however it
could be a little ſhortened. The 
<q rend="inline">"inter hortenſis elegantiae ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioſos"</q>
ſeems a little too verboſe for inſcription. Beſide, I had

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I WANT no conviction of the pleaſure which you will receive from
the termination of my infernal lawſuit. It muſt, if I have <hi>any</hi>
luck, be finally adjuſted in about nine days time; after having robbed me of
my peace for <pb n="228" facs="tcp:1250901200:249"/> ſix of the beſt years of my life.
During the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> part of life, I languiſhed for an acquaintance
ſomewhat more extenſive; and when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that flocked to ſee my
place removed all grounds of <hi>that</hi> complaint, this accurſed diſpute
aroſe, and mixed with every enjoyment that was offered me.—I have
ſometimes found entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in balancing the good and evil that has been
allotted me in general; and have in the end imagined the good prevalent, and
that I have great reaſon to be thankful for more happineſs than I
deſerve.—Yet are there many awkward circumſtances that forbid the
<hi>ſcale</hi> to fall <hi>precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately</hi>; among the chief, I place the
diſtance to which I ſee you and one or two others removed. This is indeed
an heavy article, and, were it not for letters, would be inſupportable.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. Dodſley's collection of Fables, you are miſtaken if
you think that I peruſed the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to book. I dipped into it here and there,
and thought there wanted <hi>much</hi> alteration. There was a little book with
a paper-cover, on which I beſtowed no ſmall pains; and when I had ſo
done, croſſed the Fables which I thought might well enough paſs muſter.
Addiſon would have been the beſt writer of Fables of any author I
know—the purity of ſtyle—the conciſeneſs—the dry
humour—and the familiar manner.—As to Dodſley's publiſhing this
winter, he may poſſibly do ſo, without loſs of credit; but when one
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that they are, or ought to be, the ſtandard for years to come,
one can hardly avoid wiſhing him to give them the poliſh of another
ſummer. 'Twas fortunate that you pitched upon 
<q rend="inline">"The Raven and Magpie"</q> to tranſcribe for me;
as Mr. Dodſley had ſent me 
<q rend="inline">"The Sun-flower and the Tuberoſe"</q>
               <hi>before.</hi> I think the laſt ſomewhat inferior, but will re-conſider
it before I write again. The Fable which I literally tranſlated 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1250901200:250"/> from Phaedrus was 
<q rend="inline">"The Wolf and the Crane,"</q> in order to give
Dodſley an idea on <hi>what</hi> Rollin laid the ſtreſs in Fables.</p>
            <p>As to the inſcription, I will endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt it to your
mind—
<q rend="inline">"Meritiſque reconditiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus"</q> may do, but is
not explicit enough. I want fully to expreſs a character that ſhines
remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly among ſelect acquaintance, and yet (through extreme refinement)
makes leſs figure in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic eye.</p>
            <p>I had made the ſame objection to Burke's chapter upon
<hi>words</hi>—and yet there ſeems to be ſomething right in it. Du
Bos (which I have only ſeen in <hi>French,</hi> but which I believe is alſo
tranſlated) conſiſts of three volumes, 12mo. His ſubjects are
pleaſing, and his knowledge may be entertaining; but his genius ſeems not
very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, from the little that I have conſulted in him.</p>
            <p>Dodſley is <hi>preciſely</hi> what you ſay of him; an object
of eſteem and love, and in ſome <hi>degree</hi> of admiration. His
<hi>ear</hi> does not wholly pleaſe me in writing, and yet he is intimately
affected with muſick.—Lord L—'s ear is perhaps the reverſe. I
mean, he does not much regard muſic, yet writes harmoniouſly in verſe and
proſe.</p>
            <p>Robertſon I think to buy—Butler alſo, though I ſhall not
admire him—Lord Clarendon, when I am <hi>rich</hi>—Raſſelas has
a few refined ſentiments thinly ſcattered, but is upon the whole below Mr.
J—. Did I tell you I had a letter from Johnſon, incloſing Vernon's
Pariſh-clerk? Pray take Dodſley's advice in regard to your —; and
heighten the ridiculouſneſs of your <hi>heroe,</hi> which <hi>his</hi> kind
of <hi>lunacy</hi> will countenance, yet admit him to ſay good
things.—But do not make any alteration in the narrative of your own
ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—at leaſt, till I have again peruſed it—Do not ſpurn
this fifty pounds. It will procure you <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1250901200:251"/> numerous
conveniences, which you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps otherwiſe deny yourſelf.</p>
            <p>I have paſſed four or five days, betwixt this week and laſt,
at my Lord Ward's at Hinley.—This has furniſhed me with franks,
beſide the conſolation I derive from <hi>having paid</hi> a viſit of
<hi>this kind.</hi> It is 
<q rend="inline">"ſpinis è pluribus <hi>una</hi> ſaltem
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empta."</q> The <hi>reſtraint</hi> renders them <hi>ſpinae.</hi> I hope
I may ſay ſo without umbrage, or giving an appearance of diſreſpect.
For Mr. W— is an agreeable man, and my reception was very polite.</p>
            <p>I have three or four more of theſe ſuperb vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to make, and
which I may not omit without giving real offence. To Lord Plymouth, next week;
Lord Stamford's, the week after; then to Lord Lyttelton, at our Admiral's; and
then to Lord Foley, if your friend Dr. Charleton will accompany me; then,
&amp;c. alas! alas! 
<q rend="inline">"Quid me exempta juvat ſpina?"</q> I muſt
conclude upon a ſeparate paper. That your <hi>expectation</hi> may not
<hi>deceive</hi> you in regard to the plan I promiſed, I incloſe a ſurvey
of my farm reduced to minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by a neighbouring artiſt. Let me know if it
bring the place to your memory—I think to have a plate (which may be done
at Birmingham for ſix or eight ſhillings) that ſhall leave me no trouble
but to tinge the impreſſions with colours; in order to give my friends. But
do you adviſe me to engrave <hi>this,</hi> or another that is twice as
large?</p>
            <p>I have purchaſed 
<q rend="inline">"Gerard upon Taſte,"</q> the author of which is a
Profeſſor at Edinburgh, and the book commended in the Review—you will
ſay that the Reviewers are partial to Scotch-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—I know nothing of
that, but the book is learned, and on a pleaſing ſubject—I may
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps add a ver <hi>important</hi> one—for ſurely it is altogether
unqueſtionable that taſte <hi>naturally</hi> leads <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1250901200:252"/>
to virtue. I am however in ſome doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will give you that

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOUGH I write to you again ſo ſoon, yet it really grieves me to
hear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which you ſo often make for want of time. I, who have
time to <hi>waſte</hi> by luſtres, cannot have patience with the world,
that ſuffers <hi>you</hi> to want the leiſure which you would employ to
ſo much better purpoſes. Perhaps however, you are as <hi>happy</hi> as more
leiſure could <hi>make</hi> you; the caſe is not ſo <hi>clear,</hi> as to
leave me ſatisfied of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And yet, as the pleaſures of
imagination have an undoubted claim to a real exiſtence, they muſt ſurely
afford very <hi>lively</hi> ſenſations to perſons of your ſenſibility
and refinement.—Be this as it may, I <hi>will</hi> always
<hi>murmur,</hi> that you can ſo ill ſpare time for literary
amuſement.—Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, make <hi>one</hi> effort, and finiſh the
taſk you have now before you. I muſt confeſs, you may naturally reply,
that I am now become an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted perſon; but <hi>this,</hi> I am ſure,
will be no check to your activity.</p>
            <p>Mr. William Duncombe ſent (with the firſt volume of Horace) one
of the ſatires in Mſ. <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1250901200:253"/>

               <hi>inſcribed to me.</hi> Upon purchaſing, however, the ſecond volume, I
find <hi>my</hi> name is changed to Hawkeſworth.—Who knows but I loſt
this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment by writing to you, my friend, while I ſhould have been
writing to him?—if ſo, indeed, you ought to make it up to me; and I am
ſure I ſhall prize <hi>your</hi> compliment beyond that of which I have
been deprived.</p>
            <p>The view of B—, which you mention, I have indeed ſeen a long
time ago; but ſurely the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fall</hi> is quite deteſtable. There is
ſomething on each ſide, as I remember, that puts one in mind of a
porridge-pot boiling over beneath the pot-lid. The appearance of the houſe
and the back-ground is better; this was adjuſted by the painter; the other
(as I think Smith told me) by an old houſe-ſteward of Lord T—'s.</p>
            <p>I have incloſed another copy of the lines to Venus, for your
emendation.—Thank you for the ſtanza you introduced.—I meant,
indeed, <hi>before,</hi> to allude to <hi>natural</hi> beauty more than
<hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> but did not fully enough expreſs myſelf. There remains no
tranſition now but from <hi>animal</hi> beauty to <hi>inanimate</hi>; which
is eaſier.</p>
            <p>You will obſerve, that I take great liberties with the Fables you
aſk me to reviſe.—Dodſley muſt think me <hi>very</hi>
fantaſtical or <hi>worſe,</hi> while I was correcting thoſe he wrote at
The Leaſowes.—I find my <hi>ear</hi> much more apt to take offence than
moſt other people's; and, as <hi>his</hi> is far leſs delicate than mine,
he muſt of courſe believe, in many places, that I altered merely for
alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration's ſake. I cannot be eaſy without ſome certain proportion
betwixt one ſentence and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; betwixt one member of a ſentence and
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; without a melody at the cloſe of a paragraph almoſt as agreeable
as your 
<q rend="inline">"magnificent ſalon."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have not written to Dodſley any decent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſince he
arrived at his houſe in London.—<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1250901200:256"/> I muſt now
apply myſelf to write half a ſcore Fables, and, if he chuſes it, a
tranſlation of La Motte's Diſcourſe upon the ſubject.—Your reply
in regard to the delay of <hi>my</hi> publication cannot be anſwered; that is
certain.</p>
            <p>Whitefield's Journal, I <hi>fear,</hi> is purged of its
<hi>moſt</hi> ridiculous paſſages.—Dodſley brought one down
hither for Mr. Deane to ſhew my Lord D—th; but he tells me, there
remains nothing of that <hi>groſs</hi> abſurdity which I ſaw in your
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's at Mickleton.</p>
            <p>The painter whom I juſt mentioned to have taken ſome portraits
through my recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to have painted a ruin for my green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
offers to give me my picture if I chuſe to ſit.—Were you here to lend
me your aſſiſtance, I ſhould certainly comply.—Mean while, tell
me what you think of ſome of the attitudes that I incloſe. What I myſelf
prefer at preſent is, to <hi>leſſen</hi> my <hi>dimenſions</hi> (which
of itſelf gives a kind of beauty) and to appear in a kind of night-gown
agreeable to the attitude marked AA. The man evidently hits off likeneſſes,
and is eſteemed to <hi>ſhine</hi> among the painters of Birmingham. I
ſhall be forced to have you picture copied by him, which, by means of
dampneſs, flies off the canvas; ſo that, on the whole, I ſhall re pay his
compliment.—This laſt article puts me in mind that I owe you my
picture, whenever you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; but I would chuſe to defer it till the
ſpring, for ſome certain reaſons regarding oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Remember me
<hi>always</hi> to good Mrs. —; and believe me yours, with all
poſſible affection,</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WERE I to regulate my compliments by the arrival of <hi>times</hi>
and ſeaſons, I ſhould congratulate you upon a <hi>correſpondence</hi>
which now enters upon its three and twentieth year.—Our
<hi>frienſhip</hi> is of ſomething older date; and is not this an
<hi>atchievement</hi> that deſerves the honour of a <hi>triumph</hi> both for
you and me too?—More, I am ſure, than the regular deſtruction of
fifteen or twenty thouſand wretches in the field; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how
<hi>uncommon</hi> we find friendſhips of ſo long a duration, and how
<hi>cheap</hi> we find ſuch victories, not only on the Pruſſian, but on
the Auſtrian ſide.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cambridge (Scriblerus) who called here this autumn, was
conſidering this maſſacre rather in a philoſophical than political
view; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it does not appear to me that plague, earthquake, or
famine, are more pernicious to the human race, than what the world calls
Heroes; but enough of this.</p>
            <p>Your want of leiſure gives me pain; ſurely, if I may gueſs by
one or two of your laſt letters, you have enlarged the number of your
ſcholars, and extended your domeſtic cares, beyond what your
circumſtances <hi>require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt not judge of my painter's abilities by the ſmall
ſketch I incloſe.—I deſired him to give me a <hi>ſlight</hi> one;
and have, perhaps, ruined even <hi>that</hi> by endeavouring to bring it nearer
to what the picture now <hi>is myſelf.</hi> It will give you a tolerable idea
in the moſt points, except the Pan, which has his face turned towards the 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1250901200:258"/> front; and is not near ſo conſiderable.—I
choſe to have this <hi>term</hi> introduced, not only as he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries my
favourite reeds, but as he is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>ſylvan</hi> deity.—The
Water-nymph below has the word 
<q rend="inline">"Stour"</q> on the mouth of her urn; which in ſome
ſort, riſes at The Leaſowes. On the ſcroll is, 
<q rend="inline">"Flumina amem ſylvaſque inglorius"</q> alluding
to them <hi>both.</hi>—The Pan, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps obſerve, hurts the
<hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the picture—not much, as we have managed him;
and the intention here is, I think, a balance.</p>
            <p>The dog on the other ſide is my faithful Lucy, which you perhaps
remember; and who <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>nearer</hi> the <hi>body</hi> than
ſhe perhaps would, if we had more room. However I believe, I ſhall cauſe
her head to cut off that little cluſter of angles, where the baluſtrade
joins the baſe of the arch. The baluſtrade is an improvement we made the
other day: it is, I think, a great one; not only as it gives a ſymmetry or
balance to the curtain of which you complained; but as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the
<hi>area</hi> on which I ſtand, and ſhortens the <hi>length</hi> of this
<hi>half-arch.</hi> The painter objected to a tree; I know not why; unleſs
that we could introduce no <hi>ſtem</hi> without encroaching too much upon
the landſcape: but the reaſon be gave was, it would be an injury to the
face.—The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole is an Apollo's head. The impoſt does not go
further than the pilaſter, which ends the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and here the drawing is
erroneous.—We are, I think, to have a carpet, though we know not well how
to manage it.</p>
            <p>And now, I muſt tell you the dimenſions.—The figure
itſelf is three feet, three inches and a half; the whole picture four feet,
eleven inches, by two feet, three inches and three-quarters.—The colour
of the gown, a ſea-green; waiſtcoat and breeches, buff-colour; ſtockings,
white, or rather pearl-colour; curtain a terra-ſienna, or 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1250901200:259"/> very rich reddiſh brown.—I think the whole will
have a good effect; but beſeech you to ſend me your opinion
<hi>directly.</hi> There are ſome things we can alter; but there are others
we muſt not.</p>
            <p>Your ſhall have one of the ſize you deſire in the ſpring;
but will you not calculate for ſome one place in your room? The painter takes
very ſtrong likeneſſes; is young; rather daring than delicate in his
manner, though he paints well in enamel; good-natured; ſlovenly; would
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove much by application. Adieu!</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I COULD not underſtand, by Mr. Dodſley's laſt letter to me,
that he had any <hi>ſort</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to publiſh his Fables this
winter. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon this delay, and having neither had the
<hi>leiſure</hi> nor the <hi>frame</hi> of mind fit to take his preface into
conſideration, I have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to do ſo; and can only ſay in
<hi>general,</hi> that I could wiſh you had happened to be more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in
your obſervations. La Motte's Diſcourſe on Fables is a moſt excellent
performance; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as appears to <hi>me,</hi> all that need be ſaid
upon the ſubject, and this expreſſed with all imaginable elegance and
perſpicuity. I believe I ſhall adviſe our friend D— to make more
am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſe of this diſſertation. There is a tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of La Motte
into <hi>proſe,</hi> which is altogether <hi>below contempt;</hi> and yet,
for aught I know, the <pb n="237" facs="tcp:1250901200:260"/> 
               <hi>only</hi> one. The word
<hi>naive</hi> is very probably <hi>that</hi> for which he has ſubſtituted
the word <hi>lively</hi>; though by no means of ſimilar import.
<hi>Natural</hi> approaches nearer it; but according to La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te is not
preciſe: and, as the words <hi>Naif</hi> and <hi>Naiveté</hi> ſeem
of late to become more in vouge, I will here give you an extract of what he
ſays upon the ſubject: 
<q rend="inline">"Je ne ſouhaiterois plus rien à l'Auteur de

            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:1250901200:261"/>And now, let me know what Engliſh word you
would employ to interpret <hi>Naif. Sentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> has ſome pretenſions;
but is not wholly to one's mind.</p>
            <p>I bought the quarto edition of La Motte's Fables, to which this
eſſay is prefixed; though the vaunted cuts which tempted me to this
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance did not anſwer my expectation. The author, with much addreſs,
begs the Duke of Orleans to be at the expence of them; which, to the beſt of
my remembrance, was 
<q rend="inline">"deux mille ecus."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Hurd, you ſee, is one of Dr. Warburton's Chaplains. I bought
his Dialogues Moral and Political, almoſt as ſoon they were publiſhed.
Sir Edward Lyttelton told me, the introductory one would be omitted in the next
edition. The three following are very ingenious; but the two former are a
little ambiguous in regard to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended moral: the two laſt are wholly
political, and I have not yet peruſed them, though eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
<hi>beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have you ſeen Dr. Smith's 
<q rend="inline">"Theory of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sentiments,"</q> which is
prodigiouſly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which I have bought, but not read?—You
will ſee an account of this in the Monthly Review.</p>
            <p>I have lately been reading one or two volumes of The Rambler; who,
excepting againſt ſome few hardneſſes in his manner, 
<note n="*" place="bottom">He too often makes uſe of the Abſtract
for the Concrete.</note> and the want of more examples to enliven, is one of
the moſt <hi>nervous,</hi> moſt <hi>perſpicuous,</hi> moſt conciſe,
and moſt harmonious proſe-writers I know.—A learned diction improves
by time.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to find no mention of your — in all the letters
which I have received of late. Do not think of <hi>dropping</hi> or even
<hi>delaying</hi> the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it; only, if you pleaſe, before it goes
to <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1250901200:262"/> the preſs, let me peruſe it once
deliberately.—What think you, if Dodſley approve it, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting cuts
into your ſcheme?</p>
            <p>And now, from <hi>cuts</hi> I proceed to <hi>pictures.</hi> Alcock's
portrait of me is in a manner finiſhed; and has been hung up for theſe nine
days paſt, in its carved frame, oppoſite to the fire place in my library.
<hi>They ſay</hi> it is a likeneſs, allowing for the diminution of ſize.
Indeed, if I can conclude any thing from the ſtrong reſemblance which he
has produced of <hi>others</hi> here, I may form ſome <hi>conjecture</hi>
that he has not failed in mine.—Be this as it will, the picture is, upon
the whole a tolerably pleaſing one; and this is the <hi>moſt</hi> I muſt
dare to ſay, conſidering my own perſon makes ſo large a part of it.</p>
            <p>What think you of a tawney or reddiſh brown for the robe or
night-gown, with black for the waiſtcoat and breeches, reſerving green for
the curtain? though green is, with me at leaſt, no very gay colour, nor has
it that effect which you apprehended in the drapery. Terra-ſienna is a
delightful colour; ſo, I think, is Roman ocre burnt. Let me know then, what
objections you have to the drapery juſt now propoſed. Let me know alſo
any deſign that you think moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a back-ground; or any
ſtory of two or three figures, that would be ſuitable for a relievo.</p>
            <p>From <hi>pictures</hi> I proceed to <hi>painters.</hi> I believe,
Alcock would go and ſettle at Bath, if Amos Green could be induced to join
him. Amos Green is the name of the painter whom I recommended to you <hi>before
my fever.</hi> He is eſteemed inferior to no one in England for fruit. He
alſo paints flowers, inſects, and dead-game, <hi>very</hi> well. To this he
would adjoin the buſineſs of water-painting. Alcock would paint portraits
in oil; and to this he would add enamel-painting: both of them 
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1250901200:263"/> the beſt-natured young fellows in the world. Now
ſuppoſe them alſo <hi>ingenious,</hi> and tell me whether they would have
a chance to <hi>thrieve</hi>?</p>
            <p>You ought to have a very conſiderable <hi>amends,</hi> if you are
to be plagued with writing and with muſic-maſters.—I believe I rate
your time and trouble at a much higher price than you do yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Dr. Blackſtone has raiſed himſelf to a very eminent figure,
indeed, in the world of letters. I rejoice at it, without one particle of envy,
both as he is your friend, and a perſon of merit. I believe no one, beſides
yourſelf, would have dreamt of your odd analogy betwixt him and me.—I
know not <hi>how</hi> they came to inſert that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid Song of mine in the
Chronicle.—What ſenſation it cauſed in me, was that of
diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; as it looked like laying ſtreſs on what one knows to be
of no importance.</p>
            <p>The chief points wherein my picture varies from your drawing is in
the corner below the baſe of the pedeſtal; where an antique vaſe is
introduced with a flower and two or three leaves of the ſcarlet Geranium. The
gilt vaſe agrees well enough with the gold fringe on the edge of the curtain;
but the whole is ſo <hi>ſubdued,</hi> as not to catch the eye too
ſtrongly. It was chiefly meant to obviate the diſagreebleneſs of the
<hi>parallel</hi> lines and angles occaſioned by the ſtep in that corner;
but it crowds that ſide a little, if one look from top to bottom; and, though
a pleaſing object, it is hard to ſay whether it does more good or harm.</p>
            <p>It is time now to take my leave, with my hearty reſpects to Mrs.
Graves, and with the uſual aſſurance, that I remain your moſt

me before. And ſo, betwixt buſineſs at one time, and diſſipation at
another, I am to be defrauded of a correſpondence that is quite eſſential
to my well-being. Pardon me, if, on ſuch occaſion, you find me extremely
clear-ſighted in the foibles of my friends; and do not ſay with the man in
Horace, 
<q rend="inline">"Cur in ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum vitiis, &amp;c."</q> The
<hi>matter</hi> is too <hi>important</hi> for me to connive at any ſort of
ſophiſm.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to make you eaſy on this head, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
the letter was owing to <hi>you</hi>; for which I will draw my apology neither
from <hi>buſineſs</hi> nor diſſipation; and yet how juſtly might I
palliate my long ſilence upon <hi>either</hi> footing! Since I wrote to you,
I have been <hi>buſied</hi> in bringing about a concluſion with D—.
The letters, journies, &amp;c. <hi>previous</hi> and <hi>poſterior</hi> to
the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of articles, would afford me noble matter for
excuſe.—The conſtant attendance upon workmen (of which I have
fourteen or fifteen this very day,) making a piece of water below my Priory,
would produce more on the ſcore of <hi>diſſipation</hi>—you
remember the place.—This, at preſent, is my chief employment, although
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock is drawing on the ſide of my table.—I wonder you do not get

Monthly Review, you will ſee. I bought Webb inſtantly; but have not read
it. Lord Lyttelton is <hi>allowedly</hi> the author of thoſe Dialogues;
whoſe, the very laſt, I do not know. There is a noble ſpecimen of Scotch
poetry tranſlated from the Erſe language.—I have had two copies

            </opener>
            <p>ALTHOUGH this interval in our correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt be placed, I
fear, to <hi>my</hi> account, you will hardly think it mends the matter, to
<hi>fill</hi> my preſent letter even with the beſt-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
apologies—I will only mention a bad ſtate of health, which has been my
lot this winter, as a general excuſe for two or three months ſilence; and
then declare, as with truth I may, that the eſteem and affection which you
have ſo well deſerved of me have never undergone the leaſt diminution or
abatement. It is with me a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy taſk, to <hi>write</hi> letters when I
am not well; although it be the time, of all others, when it is moſt
neceſſary for me to <hi>receive</hi> them.—Our friend Dodſley, I
preſume, has ſent you a book of his Fables before this time. What merit I
have there, is in the <hi>Eſſay</hi>; in the <hi>original Fables,</hi>
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1250901200:269"/> I can hardly claim a ſingle Fable as my own;
and in the <hi>Index,</hi> which I cauſed to be thrown into the form of
<hi>Morals,</hi> and which are almoſt wholly mine. I wiſh to God it may
ſell; for he has been at great expence about it. The two rivals which he has
to dread, are, the editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Richardſon and of Croxall. The
<hi>Fables</hi> in Croxall are tolerably writen: his <hi>reflections,</hi>
little to the purpoſe, either for boys or grown people.—Richardſon's
<hi>Improvement of L'Eſtrange</hi> would be a better collection, both for the
<hi>Fables</hi> and the <hi>moral Reflections,</hi> had he not admitted,
through an extravagant and miſtaken love of drollery, that vulgarity of
phraſe which in many places is not <hi>common Engliſh.</hi> This, I think,
a true ſtate of the caſe: ſay the beſt you can in behalf of
Dodſley.—As to his cuts, though to <hi>him</hi> expenſive, they will
hardly, I fear, meet with much of your approbation.—the ſcale is much
too ſmall—and the emblematick prints which are larger will ſcarce, I
fear, be underſtood.—I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a copy from Baſkerville
<hi>before</hi> the plates were <hi>inſerted,</hi> and have cauſed my
painter (Alcock) to ſupply the vacancies with ſome devices of my
own—ſome account of which I ſend you, as it may amuſe you for a
minute. I want one or two to compleat my ſcheme, and ſhould be glad if you
would propoſe ſome in your next letter.—I return you my hearty thanks
for the hints you gave for the Cambridge verſes; but when I received them it
was too late, and I myſelf too much indiſpoſed, either to throw them into
proper form, or even to anſwer that gentleman's letter, which I thought a
very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel one.—I know not what he did on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, having
ſeen neither Cambridge nor Oxford verſes—Mr. Dodſley gave me 
<q rend="inline">"The Environs of London."—</q>Between friends,
I wiſh he may find five thouſand readers, whom the management of that work
pleaſes more than <hi>me.</hi>—I will try to <pb n="245" facs="tcp:1250901200:270"/> get
you ſome of the <hi>cuts,</hi> if you deſire me to do ſo, though it will
reflect a kind of tacit diſlike of the <hi>whole</hi> performance—His
brother publiſhes this winter 
<q rend="inline">"The Works of Soame Jenyns,"</q> in three
pocket-volumes; and a Chineſe novel from a Mſ. tranſlation reviſed,
&amp;c. by a friend of mine. You have perhaps heard me ſpeak of Mr.
Percy—he <hi>was</hi> in treaty with Mr. James Dodſley, for the
publication of our beſt old bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, in three volumes. He has a large folio
Mſ. of ballads, which he ſhewed me, and which, with his own natural and
acquired talents, would qualify him for the purpoſe, as well as any man in
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I propoſed the ſcheme for him <hi>myſelf,</hi> wiſhing to
ſee an elegant <hi>edition</hi> and good col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of this kind.—I
was alſo to have aſſiſted him in ſelecting and rejecting; and in
fixing upon the beſt readings—But my illneſs broke off our
correſpondence, the beginning of winter—and I know not what he has done
ſince.—There is a New Peerage going to be publiſhed—with, I
believe, the draughts of the Peers houſes—Lightholer called here, and
ſaid he had taken Lord Lyttleton's, and Lord Stamford's, for that
purpoſe.—the latter of which he ſhewed me.—Thus have I told you
what I hear of new <hi>publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi>—as to what paſſes in the
buſy world, I know no more than the Chronicle informs me,—unleſs when
<hi>your</hi> letters happen to be <hi>rounded</hi> with little anecdotes from
Bath.—Have you ſeen Baſkerville's new Prayer-books?—My Lord
Dartmouth has undertaken to preſent two to the King and Princeſs.—Do,
for <hi>charity</hi> ſake, make me ſome amends for this long chaſm in our

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I WILL, upon your laſt aſſurance, take it <hi>ever</hi> for
granted, that you do not omit writing upon any ſcore of ceremony. This will
render your ſilence, at leaſt in ſome <hi>degree,</hi> leſs irkſome
to me; when I do not think it the effect of my own procraſtination.—Mr.
Dodſley had ſold two thouſand of his Fables long ago; but complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he ſhould <hi>loſe</hi> thirty pounds by my neighbour Baſkerville's
impreſſion; and that he ſhould not be more than ten pounds gainer upon
the <hi>whole.</hi> I told him it was enough, in books of <hi>this ſort,</hi>
if the firſt edition paved the way for their future eſtabliſhment in
ſchools. And ſurely ſo it is: for a book of this kind, once
eſtabliſhed, becomes an abſolute eſtate for many years; and brings in
at leaſt as certain and as regular returns. I would <hi>wiſh</hi> him to
give the polite world one more edition from Baſkerville's preſs; admitting
only a <hi>new</hi> ſett of emblematical top and tail-pieces; and confining
thoſe empty cuts relating to each Fable to the cheap edition which he prints
at London. A ſecond edition of this latter ſort will appear in a little
time; and if you have any improvements to propoſe, he will very thankfully
receive them. Mr. Spence offers him to write <hi>the life</hi> afreſh; and
Spence, Burke, Lowth, and Melmoth, adviſe him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
<hi>Italicks.</hi> I confeſs he has uſed them to a very great
<hi>exceſs,</hi> but yet I do not think they ſhould be utterly
diſcarded.</p>
            <p>I did not intend that Mr. Davenport ſhould ever hear of thoſe
verſes; and how he came to do ſo, is paſt my comprehenſion. He ſeemed
to <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1250901200:272"/> me to have deſerted Worfield, without any
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to return again. I therefore meant to inſcribe them under my own
Venus, in order to afford ſome novelty, at an <hi>eaſy rate,</hi> to
thoſe who are curious enough to <hi>repeat</hi> their viſits here. Pray, if
you ſee Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, preſent my beſt reſpects to them; and
as to the verſes, I will ſend you a copy for them, if you <hi>deſire</hi>
or <hi>adviſe</hi> me ſo to do.—Mr. S — is agreeable, not void
of learning, has ſome ſmartneſs, but little taſte.—Mrs. S — has
<hi>much</hi> of the latter; and perhaps imagination, which makes a part of
taſte, may have had no ſmall ſhare in converting her to Popery.—Mr.
Powys I have almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.—You are ingenious very inventive in
regard to the means of giving yourſelf mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I dare to ſay, your
new building ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts no ſuch idea as you conceive.—And I think it
ſufficient in a parſonage-houſe, if one ſees detached ſpecimens of
taſte or elegance, without uniformity, or even without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency.</p>
            <p>I do not find but that you <hi>figure</hi> among the gentry near
Bath. Dr. Charlton, who was here yeſterday with Sir Francis and Mr. Knight,
gave me an account that the B— of G— had been to pay his reſpects
to you. I will not enter into particulars, but would wiſh you to cultivate
his acquaintance.—I ſhewed Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis the dead colouring of the
picture which I intend to ſend to you;—but you muſt know that Alcock
is the moſt volatile of all creatures that have not wings. By way of
improving the picture I meant for Dodſley, he has made it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely leſs
like, and yet it muſt go to London as <hi>it is,</hi> for God knows when he
can be brought to alter it.</p>
            <p>I aſked the Doctor, how Mr. Blackſtone came to obtain a ſeat
in Parliament; and his <pb n="248" facs="tcp:1250901200:273"/> anſwer was, 
<q rend="inline">"The King inſiſted on it, as he was a man of
learning and ingenuity."—</q>The enmity betwixt Lord L—n and Mr.
P—, I find, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in its full force; inſomuch that my Lord is to
have no place while Mr. P— continues in the miniſtry.—My Lord
B—'s promotion was, it ſeems, demanded by the D. of N— and Mr.
P—, as they would not be expoſed to bear the blame, while he was the
chief mover behind the curtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Theſe little particles of intelligence have, I believe, Sir — for their
author.—I was told by another politician, the ſame day, that we were
not to expect a peace—that the French, who might give up the Colonies,
would not reſign the Fiſhery.</p>
            <p>Mr. Knight, his mother and ſiſter, go through Bath to Mr.
Bamfylde's in about three weeks, if nothing intervene. I am teazed greatly to
accompany them,—by my own <hi>inclination,</hi> I can aſſure you, as
well as their <hi>importunity.</hi> I do not ſay I will <hi>not,</hi> nor
muſt I ever promiſe you <hi>before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi> that I <hi>will.</hi> I have
good reaſons to the contrary. They have ſome thoughts of bringing Dr.

            </opener>
            <p>I OUGHT to have thanked you many weeks ago, for a very <hi>long</hi>
and <hi>entertaining</hi> letter; the <hi>length</hi> of which, as well as the
<hi>entertainment,</hi> was <pb n="249" facs="tcp:1250901200:274"/> increaſed by a
Poſtſcript a few days after.—But as the Winter is with me a dull and
uniform ſeaſon, ſo the Summer is a time of univerſal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation;
and very happy do I think myſelf, when after a continual ſucceſſion of
company, viſits paid, and excurſions taken, I can ſit down in peace and
quietneſs, to attend to the buſineſs of correſpondence and
friendſhip. Either reaſon, habit, or complexion tells me, that I am never
<hi>otherwiſe</hi> ſo properly employed.</p>
            <p>The laſt digreſſion I made was to the concert at Worceſter,
to hear The Meſſiah well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; to meet a number of faces one knows;
but firſt, and principally, to viſit your brother, <hi>without</hi> which
motive I had not gone. In the two <hi>former</hi> reſpects, the journey
anſwered my expectation:—but, alas! your brother was gone into
Herefordſhire. I, however, alighted out of the chaiſe; and the
houſe-keeper very civilly ſhewed me his delightful parlour, that looks
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meadows, the Prebend's gardens, and down the Severn to Malvern-hills.
A more agreeable town-houſe cannot poſſibly be found any where. But I
regretted, when I reached the inn, that I had not aſked to ſee his
children; for I either heard them up-ſtairs, had a glimpſe of them at the
window, or fancied, to a degree of conviction, that they were moſt of them
within the houſe. I now return to remark upon ſome particulars in your
letter—I believe it is that indifference you complain of, which is the
<hi>grand</hi> detriment to genius in an advanced part of life. In all
<hi>poetical</hi> affairs, we are too apt to cry out with Pallas, 
<q rend="inline">"Non eſt mihi tibia tanti."</q> And this renders
all our efforts tame, proſaic, and judicious. But this propenſity, as well
as many others, we ſhould guard againſt, upon the approach of age: change
the object of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements; cheriſh hopes, well or ill-grounded, 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1250901200:275"/> of finding that pleaſure in the novelty of objects,
which we have not found in any individual. Theſe are the means of
<hi>preſerving our vivacity</hi> a ſomewhat longer time than it naturally
laſts; but how far it is <hi>prudent</hi> to attach ourſelves to the world
that we muſt leave, is a point which <hi>you</hi> better can determine.
Refined taſte, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a <hi>love</hi> of phyſical beauty, has this
tendency.</p>
            <p>There is nothing can be more rational than what you ſay about the
expediency of <hi>loſing no time,</hi> if I mean to collect and publiſh
what I have written. You are indeed very partial to my abilities; but, allowing
for <hi>that,</hi> what you mention <hi>coincides</hi> with what I have thought
my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and this for ſome years paſt. A more agreeable kind of
<hi>diſtraction</hi> in ſummer, and an indifferent ſtate of health and
ſpirits in winter, have hitherto prevented any progreſs in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of my pieces. To theſe I might add a <hi>ſuſpence</hi> about the
compoſitions, and the manner, proper for publication. I am now moſt
inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a collection of the whole. I mean, the beſt of what are
already printed or in Mſ.; to publiſh them by ſubſcription in a large
<hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> ſize for the ſake of profit; and to apologize for this
method, by mentioning the expence of top and tail-pieces, with which I mean
they ſhall be embelliſhed. Some of <hi>theſe</hi> (by the bye) may be
taken from my farm, the reſt emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, in an eaſy and careleſs, but,
at the ſame time, elegant manner. I ſhould think the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Mr.
Pope might render this method not diſreputable; and it might be advertiſed
(as was done by Mr. Spence) that, unleſs a certain number were ſubſcribed
for, the whole affair ſhould be no farther proſecuted. This would put it in
the way of many friends to ſerve me, who (I flatter myſelf) <hi>with
inclination,</hi> eſteem themſelves void of <hi>opportunity.</hi> Let me
beg you <pb n="251" facs="tcp:1250901200:276"/> to think ſeriouſly of this, as well as of a
general title-page, before you write again.</p>
            <p>Thank you kindly for all the little diverting anecdotes that are
contained in your letter. I am glad to hear your <hi>place</hi> brings you
company; partly, as it tends to amuſe you; and yet more, as it tends to make
your merit more conſpicuous. You and I have led a life of total
diſintereſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let me adviſe you to ſeek ſome <hi>advantage</hi>
from your commerce with <hi>great men.</hi>—The boy, who was here with
you and Mrs. Graves, was here laſt Friday evening with a Mr. Jolliffe and his
ſon; the latter of whom obſerved your name upon the bench, and ſeemed
proud to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he was once your ſchool-fellow. Mr. Stratford (to whom

he publiſhes—I have not yet read Dr. Robertſon's Hiſtory, to my
ſhame be it ſpoken, though I have the honour to know the author.—I
hope the King <hi>will</hi> oblige the Iriſh Peers with a place in the
proceſſion, as that people ſeem greatly out of temper; and, I fear, not
without ſome reaſon.</p>
            <p>I ſee my friend Dodſley has <hi>let off</hi> his little
<hi>ſquib</hi> upon the marriage, in the Chronicle. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>The King ſought a partner,</hi>" &amp;c.</q>
and laſt night was brought me, from Baſkerville's preſs, on the ſame
occaſion, very <hi>pompouſly</hi> printed, the moſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Grub-ſtreet I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>I have made ſome little improvements about my place; have taken
away the wall in front, and made a handſome ring; have extended my path, in
one piece of ground, greatly for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—but the grand water in the
valley will make no figure till next ſpring.</p>
            <p>I have alſo aſſiſted my friend Hull the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian in
altering the Tragedy of Roſamond; had it brought upon the ſtage to a full
houſe at Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham, where it was very well received; put Hull into a way of
making an indirect compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the preſent King in the ten laſt lines of
his Epilogue, which was followed by 
<q rend="inline">"God ſave great George," &amp;c.</q> in a full
chorus of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and actors drawn out abreaſt upon the ſtage.</p>
            <p>Since this, there has been depoſited in my hands a large
collection of Poetry, by a Miſs Wheatly of Walſall: many of the pieces
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in an excellent and truly claſſical ſtyle; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſentimental, harmonious, and more correct than I almoſt ever ſaw written
by a lady. They will be publiſhed, I believe, by ſubſcription, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
patronage of Lord Dartmouth.</p>
            <p>But nothing in the poetical way has pleaſed me better than a
compliment which I received <pb n="253" facs="tcp:1250901200:280"/> about nine days ago by the
poſt, under the feigned name <hi>Cotſwouldia.</hi>—She muſt be
ſome Glouſterſhire lady that has ſeen the place; as ſhe raiſes up a
Fairy in my grove, into whoſe mouth ſhe puts the compliment. It ſeems
writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſomebody of faſhion by the ſtyle.—Can you form any
conjecture?</p>
            <p>There was a Mr. Freeman of Betſtow (or ſome ſuch name) with
two or three ladies in a coach and fix that were here not long before; a very
genteel and polite young man.</p>
            <p>I really know not how to ſtop, when I begin a letter to

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I FIND you will <hi>not</hi> write, unleſs I give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
anſwer to your letters; and yet, God knows, I have a better excuſe for my
delay, than I wiſh my friend to have for his punctilio—I mean,
indiſpoſition.—Whence it has happened, I cannot ſay, unleſs I may
blame theſe continual eaſt winds; but I have ſuffered more from the
ſmiles of ſpring, than I have really done from the frowns of winter.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed thus much, I lay your letter before me. The
expence of printing a ſheet of thoſe commendatory verſes at a common
preſs is eighteen ſhillings; and at Baſkerville's about 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1250901200:281"/> three pounds, ten ſhillings: nor do I mean any
decorations, unleſs perhaps 
<q rend="inline">"The King-fiſher,"</q> or 
<q rend="inline">"View of my Grove,"</q> which you know, I
<hi>have</hi> engraven ready to <hi>my</hi> hands. So you ſee that
<hi>this</hi> offering to vanity is not likely to be the moſt
expenſive.</p>
            <p>I wiſh you had beſtowed ſomewhat more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention upon <hi>the
title</hi>; in which <hi>caſe,</hi> I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the job had been
executed long ago. Pray be ſo kind as to re-conſider it.—Is not 
<q rend="inline">"The Garland of Friendſhip"</q> a little too
quaint? for that, as I remember, was what I propoſed.—The
<hi>motto</hi> which you propoſed was a very good one; and I think alſo,
that the addition of the next line would be an improvement to it; 
<q rend="inline">"et iſti er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rori, nomen virtus poſuiſſet
honeſtum."</q> But I do not love <hi>double</hi> mottoes; ſo, if I admit
this, I muſt exclude what I propoſed; which, to ſpeak the truth, was of
my own invention.</p>
            <p>The cuſtom of prefixing commendatory verſes to collections of
poetry is now ſeemingly grown obſolete. Beſides, in my caſe, they would
only ſhew, that I had <hi>taken</hi> up more fame than my funds would
anſwer. I return you many thanks for <hi>your</hi> poetical benevolence; but
why do you mention it under the name of <hi>Epigram</hi>? I do not even chuſe
that it ſhould have the air of <hi>ſimile</hi> from the <hi>beginning</hi>:

<q> 
                  <l>Lo the tall youth, by partial fate's decree,</l> 
                  <l>To affluence born, and from reſtraint ſet free;</l> 
                  <l>How pleaſed he, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have taken <hi>this</hi> and ſome <hi>other</hi> liberties with
it, and ſhall inſert it among the reſt; unleſs you chuſe to
<hi>redeem</hi> it, with ſomething more to your ſatisfaction; for, to
ſpeak with frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I think it better calculated to do <hi>me</hi>
honour than <hi>yourſelf</hi>; though I could eſteem it <hi>good,</hi> if
it <pb n="255" facs="tcp:1250901200:282"/> came from a perſon whoſe abilities I reſpected
leſs than yours. There is a ſubject here, which I would recommend to you,
if by ſo doing I ſhould lay you under no <hi>reſtraint.</hi> It is my
principal caſcade. Its appearance well reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the playfulneſs of
infancy; ſkipping from ſide to ſide, with a thouſand antic motions,
that anſwer no other purpoſe than the mere amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
proprietor.—Other ſimilitudes, &amp;c. would here occur; 
<q>Cui enim naſcenti faciles arriſerunt Muſae, &amp;c.</q> It
then proceeds a few hundred yards, where it <hi>rolls</hi> and <hi>ſlits
iron</hi> for manufactures of all kinds; reſembling the graver toils of
manhood, either in acquiring money, or furniſhing the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
comforts, or ornaments of life: and, in this manner, it proceeds under the name
of The Stour, ſupplying works for caſting, forging, and and ſhaping iron,
for every civil or military pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Perhaps you may not know that my rills
are the principal ſources of this river; or that this river ſupplies
<hi>more</hi> iron-works than almoſt any ſingle river in the kingdom: for
ſo my friend Mr. Knight told me.</p>
            <p>The Mr. D— you enquire after, and who wrote the
<hi>beſt</hi> addreſs Sir Robert Walpole ever <hi>received,</hi> is Mr.
Dodington.—Did I never ſend you a liſt of all the concealed names in
that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellany?—I began to tranſcribe one from my own ſet; but
find one part of my liſt is loſt; I however ſend it, and will piece it
out when I find an opportunity; as I purpoſe alſo to give you ſome
account of our ſeveral merits of Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley's Fables. By the way, do not the
verſes to Dr. Cornwallis (now Biſhop) affect you ſenſibly, vol. VI. p.
158?—they do <hi>me,</hi> whenever I read them; and I cannot help
applying them to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <pb n="256" facs="tcp:1250901200:283"/> I feel ſomewhat of the
ſame ſenſation when I read 
<q rend="inline">"The Letters of Henry and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;"</q> in which
(from ſelf-partiality, no doubt) I find myſelf extremely like Henry.</p>
            <p>Pray let me hear, if you pleaſe, of Mr. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.—I wiſh
I had learnt to <hi>draw</hi> well in early life.—It would have given me
ſome very great advantages. Let me hear alſo much of Mr. Melmoth, who, I
preſume, has left you long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time. I did once deſign to have
ſent you down my propoſals for a ſubſcription, and requeſted the
favour of <hi>you two</hi> to ſettle them finally, without any further
reference to myſelf; but my head and ſpirits have been too bad to undertake
even a common letter.—What think you of Dr. Lowth's Grammar?—Livie
met him at Mr. Dodſley's, and ſays, he is well pleaſed with <hi>our</hi>
frontiſpiece, &amp;c. to Horace. Livie could not preſent his book to Lord
Bute, <hi>himſelf,</hi> on account of my Lord's indiſpoſition. Mr. Dalton
(Dr. Dalton's brother) who teaches the K. to draw, preſented it. It ſeems,
this Dr. Dalton (who gave the drawing of Lord Bute's arms) has lodgings in the
palace, and ſees the King every day. <hi>While</hi> Livie was <hi>with</hi>
him, word came that the King was coming into his room; upon which Livie was
ſent out another way.—The King aſked Dalton, whom he had with
him?—and was anſwered, an editor of Horace, who had inſcribed it to
Lord Bute.—Dalton is to preſent a copy to the King.</p>
            <p>I incloſe to you a ſpecimen of the decorated parts of Horace,
with the frontiſpiece.—The book will be publiſhed in a month's time,
when I mean you a copy from thoſe that are allotted to me.</p>
            <p>My Lord Bute's arms are unexceptionably well finiſhed.—The
other plates, either through negligence, or the wilfulneſs of the deſigner
and <pb n="257" facs="tcp:1250901200:284"/> engraver, have given me infinite trouble and
vexation. However, with about <hi>two-thirds</hi> of my directions obſerved,
they will, I hope, afford you ſome pleaſure; and diſcover ſomewhat more
<hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> than one commonly finds in ſuch
deſigns.—Send me your remarks very particularly, I beſeech you.</p>

               <salute>Dear Mr. Graves,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DO I really owe you an apology? you who are embarraſſed with
ſuch a number of momentous concerns, as hardly allow a fair trial to letters
of mere amuſement? Alas! I cannot ſhelter my long ſilence under a
ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind. I believe, I even <hi>hope,</hi> that you have
diſapproved my long neglect; as I can very faithfully aſſure you, I have
repeatedly done, <hi>myſelf.</hi> There are certain times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
when I have not either the <hi>power</hi> or the <hi>will</hi> to write; as
Hannibal ſaid about attacking Rome, 
<q rend="inline">"quandoque memtem non dari, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doque
poteſtalem."</q> This being an intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual kind of <hi>lethargy,</hi> it
would have been at leaſt a friendly office, if you had <hi>rouzed</hi> me, as
you <hi>might</hi> have done, by a ſupernumerary let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I never receive a
line from you, but I feel an almoſt irreſiſtible propenſity to anſwer
it that very inſtant. Impediments ſometimes occur; and, that inſtant
being neglected, matter is accumulated for a longer letter than I am always
reſolute enough to undertake: at the ſame time, I can never content
myſelf with uttering one half of what I have to ſay.—Pray 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1250901200:285"/> is not that <hi>good ſort of man,</hi> to whom you
allude, a Mr. K—? Let him be ever ſo good a ſort of man in the common
eſtimation, I dare aver him to be neither an ingenious perſon nor a candid
critic. There may be fifty or more preferable readings to what are received in
this new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race: yet he will find a better <hi>text</hi> there <hi>upon the
whole,</hi> than in any one edition before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. As to the <hi>beauty</hi>
of <hi>type</hi> and <hi>preſs-work,</hi> it is too obvious to need
vindication. The accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the <hi>latter</hi> almoſt exceeds what was
ever found in any other book. Then as to the <hi>fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece,</hi> it is, I
think, much ſuperior to ſuch as <hi>ordinarily</hi> occur; the
<hi>ſubject</hi> animated, and well choſen; and the <hi>execution</hi> very
commendable: at leaſt, if we allow for the <hi>nice</hi> touches which it
required, and the <hi>uncommon difficulty</hi> of getting any thing of this
kind done to one's direction.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walpole is a lively and ingenious writer; not always accurate in
his determinations, and much leſs ſo in his language: too often led away,
by a deſire of routing prejudices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying giants. And yet there is
no province wherein he appears to more advantage, in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> than in
throwing new light upon Characters in Britiſh Hiſtory. I wiſh he would
compoſe a regular work, making this his principal point. He has, with great
labour, in his Book of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, recorded matter of little importance,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to people that were of leſs. I have a right to be ſevere, for his
volumes coſt me above thirty ſhillings; yet, where he drops the
<hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarian</hi> in them, his remarks are ſtriking, and worth
peruſal.—I have ſent for 
<q rend="inline">"Geſner's Rural Poems,"</q> and intend to ſee 
<q rend="inline">"The Death of Abel;"</q> though I expect to find
ſmall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this <hi>poetical proſe,</hi> unleſs exquiſitely
well tuned.—Thank you for the anecdote of Lord Courtney: a thouſand
ſuch ſort of things, that <pb n="259" facs="tcp:1250901200:286"/> engage the public
attention, are never capable of penetrating the depth of my retirement.</p>
            <p>Mr. Melmoth you will probably ſee often, as he intends to make
Bath his place of reſidence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Omphale</hi> you ſent me is a moſt excellent figure, and
I ſhall wiſh much to get a good caſt of it; at leaſt, when I am able to
afford it.—When I write again, I will give you the beſt account I can
of <hi>my ſhare</hi> in Dodſley's new Fables; though it will be no eaſy
matter to ſpeak <hi>ſeparately</hi> of it, with any preciſion.</p>
            <p>And now, I think, I have ſpoke to moſt of the articles in your
laſt letter.—Mr. Dodſley, who ſays he viſited you, would acquaint
you how we divided our time whilſt he was here, into two <hi>principal</hi>
parts, 
<q rend="inline">"l'un à dormir, l'autre à ne rien
faire."</q> Yet we paid our devoirs to a good deal of genteel company; of which
this ſeaſon has afforded me at <hi>leaſt</hi> an equal ſhare with any
that went before. I will particularize a few; opening the liſt with no leſs
perſonages than the Duke and Dutcheſs of Richmond—Mr. Walſh, member
for Worceſter—Earl of Bath with Dr. Monſon, Mrs. Montague (who wrote
the three laſt Dialogues printed with Lord Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telton's) and other company,
from Hagley—Sir Richard Aſhley—Mr. Mordaunt—Dr. Charlton
with Mr. Knight—Earl and Counteſs of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton—Mr.
Amyand—Lord Plymouth and Sir Harry Parker—Mr. and Mrs. Morrice of
Percefield—Lord Mansfield with Mr. Baron Smythe, Lord Dartmouth and Mr.
Talbot—Marquis of Taviſtock and Earl of Oſſory—your nephew
Mr. Graves, with Mr. Hopton and one of the ſenior Proctors of Oxford
—Lord and Lady Dacre—Baron Pleſſen, gentleman of the bedchamber
to the King of Denmark, with Mr. Wendt his tutor—Lord and Lady Vernon of
Sedbury, with his children, Sir Charles and <pb n="260" facs="tcp:1250901200:287"/> Lady Tynte,
and Mr. Garrick's brother—Mr. and Mrs. Melmoth—Colonel
James—Lady Ward and Lady Uill, with Miſs Wrotteſley, Miſs Pigott,
&amp;c.—Lord Lyttelton, Mr. Lyttel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Mr. Ruſt—Lord and
Lady Dartmouth with Lord and Lady Willoughby de Broke—Mr. Anſon of
Shuckburgh with Mr. Stuart the painter and publiſher of 
<q rend="inline">"Athenian Ruins"—</q>Mr. Pepys and Sir W.
Wheeler's ſon. Mr. Pitt's nephew, &amp;c.—Colonel Bamfylde with Mr.
Knight's family, &amp;c. &amp;c. I did not imagine my liſt would have
engroſſed ſo much of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and leave ſo little room to ſpeak
about the individuals.—Lord M— appeared to me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>man of
wit</hi> than a <hi>man of taſte</hi>; Baron Smythe, the reverſe—Mr.
and Mrs. Morrice, extremely polite and agreeable people, invited me
preſſingly to their habitation; I could not help reflecting on the
ſingular happineſs of Mr. Morrice, to be poſſeſſed at once of a
large fortune, one of the fineſt ſituations in England, and a wife whoſe
taſte for rural improvements appears even ſuperior to his own; at leaſt,
if the <hi>beauty</hi> of her <hi>perſon</hi> did not impoſe upon my
judgement. There are many others whom I would diſtinguiſh, if my time or
paper would permit.—I ſuppoſe that you and Mr. Dodſley would be
mighty unanimous with regard to the propriety of ſetting my ſubſcription
on foot—I do not diſpute any of your arguments—they tally exactly
with my own opinion; at leaſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for the higher idea you have of my
pieces than they deſerve—the truth is, that I have deferred the
publication too long <hi>already,</hi>—till many of the compoſitions
will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the ſame advantage as before: and till I have not half
the power that I had formerly, to improve them. When I am low-ſpirited, I
almoſt ſhudder at this tremendous contract <pb n="261" facs="tcp:1250901200:288"/> with the
publick; when my ſpirits are elevated, I ſee the neceſſity that you do,
of not loſing a moment's time—were you here a week, you would put the
matter upon a footing that was unalterable—Would to God you <hi>were</hi>
here, or any one <hi>like</hi> you! however, it is probable you will
<hi>ſoon</hi> hear from me again upon this very ſubject—I
<hi>know</hi> this, that <hi>if</hi> I print at <hi>all,</hi> the
ſubſcription is by no means to be neglected this preſent winter.—I
have ſeen our friend Dr. Charlton many times this ſeaſon; at The
Leaſowes; at Mr. Knight's; at his own houſe; and at my Lord Foley's. This
viſit to my Lord Foley's was performed about three weeks ago. I went with
young Knight; and the company of the Doctor and Sir Francis Charlton took off
all reſtraint, and made the viſit perfectly agreeable. My Lord's behaviour
was entirely free and hoſpitable; and his converſation lively and
entertaining—I muſt confeſs, far beyond the idea which I have been
taught to conceive of him.—His table, the moſt magnificent, I believe,
of any nobleman's for thirty miles round—His park, and Woobery-hill
adjacent, afford views that are either extenſive, wild, beautiful, or grand.
The portico before his lodge deſerves particular notice—his houſe
large and commodious, and well furniſhed; but ſcarce any of the rooms
<hi>high</hi> enough to ſtand the teſt of modern criticiſm. But what
ſtrikes more than all the reſt, is the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his
Chapel—which, however, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay to deſcribe; for I, this very
<hi>moment,</hi> receive your letter.—After having written ſo much
before, I can only touch upon ſome few particulars.—I believe, my
ſcheme of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will proceed in a little time, and that you will
ſoon hear from me again.—If you can poſſibly excuſe me to Mr.
Davenport, and <pb n="262" facs="tcp:1250901200:289"/> keep me well with him for a week or
fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, I will not fail to write him a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful letter. I am truly
aſhamed of my neglect; but have written more letters within this week than I
have done for a quarter of a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—That there is a faction
forming againſt Lord B—. I really believe.—The war may ſuit the

a very material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; which it would be no way difficult to
demonſtrate—at leaſt I am one that cry out, 
<q>Nulla ſalus bello: pacem te poſeimus omnes.</q> I am quite
unacquainted with the affair relating to Colonel Wilkes and Lord Bute's
ſon.—And now (though I mean to write again ſoon) I will releaſe you
from this unpleaſing ſcrawl.—I beg however that you would not fail to
write to me <hi>directly,</hi> if you can find leiſure; being quite impatient
to converſe with you, after ſuch a chaſm in our correſpondence; and

               <salute>My dear friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A THOUSAND thanks to you for the very obliging and humorous Poem
which you are ſo kind to ſend me. I really think it very ingenious, and,
upon the whole, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely correct; although I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of
propoſing one or two hints for farther improvement. The relation that it
bears to me and my place <hi>may</hi> tend to prejudice my <hi>judgement</hi>;
but I cannot conceive that it requires aught beſide <hi>impartiality,</hi> to
reliſh the beauties of this Poem. I beg I may receive a fair copy in your own
hand, as ſoon as poſſible; and I will conſider, in the mean time, how
to ſhew it to the publick in the moſt advantageous manner. It certainly
does me <hi>honour:</hi> as things are at preſent circumſtanced, it may
<hi>tend</hi> to do me <hi>good</hi>: which I am very ſure you would be glad
to ſee. I am a little aſhamed to be ſo much behind-hand with you, in
favours of <hi>this</hi> and <hi>other</hi> kinds: but I live in hopes there
may come a day, when I ſhall find occaſion to expreſs my gratitude. The
pictures you ſent arrived ſafe on Thurſday; and have been ſince
cleaned, and put up in their places. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter upon this ſubject now;
finding it almoſt ſix o'clock at night, and having juſt received a letter
from Mr. Dodſley, which he requires me to anſwer by return of poſt. It
relates to the <hi>ſcheme</hi> mentioned in his laſt, which is intended for
my emolument; but which I muſt not expect to ſucceed, without
conſiderable mortification. This <hi>inter nos.</hi>—You muſt by no
means lay aſide the thoughts of <pb n="264" facs="tcp:1250901200:291"/> perfecting
<hi>Edge-hill,</hi> at your leiſure. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that, in order to
keep clear of flattery, I have ſaid leſs in its favour than I really
<hi>ought</hi>—but I never conſidered it otherwiſe than as a Poem
which it was very adviſeable for you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and <hi>finiſh.</hi> I
am now to deſire my beſt reſpects to Mrs. Jago, and to bid you an
affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate adieu.</p>
            <q>Tu comes antiquus! tu primis junctus ab annis!</q>
            <p>I am, my dear friend! ever yours, with the trueſt eſteem,</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MR. G— tells me, that you have done me the honour to lay
ſome ſtreſs upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a letter from me. Alas! it muſt be owing
purely to your benevolence, which makes you wiſh to hear of an abſent
friend, and not to any expectations you can reaſonably form of entertainment
from his pen. The long letter with which you favoured me was ſo very lively
as well as ingenious, that I deſpaired of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my fountains the
vivacity you do from the Bath-waters. But, be this as it will, the vein of
friendſhip that runs through your letter demands my ampleſt
acknowledgements; and if you will accept of <hi>ſuch</hi> returns, I
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they will be as <hi>hearty</hi> as they are <hi>inſipid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I agree with you, that the firſt ſallies of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination will
generally prove the moſt ſprightly; <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1250901200:292"/> and that they
will often comprehend the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal features of a ſubject. They are of the
nature of dead-colouring in a portrait; which one ſometimes thinks more
ſpirited than the ſame performance when finiſhed. And yet a <hi>good</hi>
painter will not <hi>hurt</hi> a portrait by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent labour he
beſtows upon it, nor will a <hi>good</hi> writer injure his piece by the
pains he takes to round and perfect it. It muſt be ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the
taſte of either that makes his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence detrimental, or gives occaſion
for a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-by to cry out, 
<q rend="inline">"Manum de tabula."</q> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will appear
upon examination, that works which coſt moſt labour have generally been
thought the <hi>eaſieſt,</hi> and pleaſed the <hi>longeſt.</hi> One
cannot, however, deny that there is a ſort of perſons formed by nature for
<hi>ſhooting flying,</hi> (which, by the way, I could never <hi>do</hi>) and
that their ſallies of imagination are what they can hardly improve by any
future pains. Theſe may be called men of wit and fire, but it is the union of
<hi>taſte</hi> with theſe that conſtitutes fine writing. True taſte
will never ſtiffen or overcharge any performance: it will rather be employed
to ſmooth, ſimplify, and give that eaſe on which <hi>grace</hi> depends.
One can as little deny that there are <hi>kinds</hi> of writing which have a
better chance than others to ſucceed without much labour, which ſtart forth
mature at <hi>firſt,</hi> as Pallas did from the brain of Jupiter. Works of
<hi>humour</hi> are often of this ſort; and there are many inſtances in
Butler's Hudibras. Yet I think the humour of <hi>Swift</hi> was greatly owing
to a judicious <hi>reviſal.</hi> Pardon me, my dear friend, for this tedious
diſcuſſion, which you little thought of bringing upon yourſelf by the
obliging hint you gave concerning thoſe verſes upon Venus. I do acknowledge
that an additional ſtanza there, containing a reflexion on Chineſe
architecture, were better laid aſide. <pb n="266" facs="tcp:1250901200:293"/> It ſeemed to
me one of the 
<q rend="inline">"ſplendi da pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata,"</q> that might be a little
<hi>popular</hi> at this <hi>time</hi>; and has, therefore, for this
ſeaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on a board by the ſide of the Venus. We, who cannot
erect freſh temples, or even add a new garden-ſeat every ſpring, are
obliged to make the moſt we can of a new and toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able copy of verſes,
that coſts us <hi>thought</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>money</hi>; and even at a
pinch to piece out a dull ſcene with duller poetry: how elſe could I keep
my place in countenance, ſo near the pompous piles of Hagley? And yet there
are few <hi>faſhionable</hi> viſitants that do not ſhew an
<hi>affection</hi> for the little Amoret, as much as they admire the ſtately
Sachariſſa—
<q rend="inline">"plerumque gratae <hi>divitibus vices.</hi>"</q> I
have often conſidered why thoſe poſſeſſed of palaces yet eſteem a
root-houſe or a cottage as a deſirable object in their gardens.—Is it
not from having experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the imperfection of happineſs in higher life,
that they are led to <hi>conceive</hi> it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat beneath a roof of
ſtraw, where, perhaps, it may really be as defective as in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
a King or a Miniſter?—A thouſand thanks to you and Mrs. Davenport for
the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations you ſo kindly offer me. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will no more ſuffer
me to queſtion the <hi>cordiality</hi> than the politeneſs of your
reception. What an amuſing picture have you given of Bath! pleaſures
carried to the utmoſt height, and opiates ready when one is cloyed with
pleaſures! And yet, let me confeſs a truth, you have <hi>lightly</hi>
touched upon thoſe <hi>very</hi> articles, which would prove to me the moſt
<hi>ſpecifically</hi> pleaſing. For can any temptation be ſtronger, than
to ſay that <hi>you</hi> reſide there? and does not my friend G— reſide
at Claverton, of whoſe genius and friendſhip I have had proofs
theſe twenty years paſt? and have you not Mr. Webb, and now Mr. Melmoth, to
make Bath <hi>enviable</hi> 
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1250901200:294"/> for the reſidence of
literature? What a joy would it afford me to go on a party with you to
Percefield, whither Mr. and Mrs. Morrice gave me the moſt preſſing
invitations!—Theſe ſurely are pleaſures of which—I
<hi>hope</hi> one day to partake.</p>
            <p>My health, generally bad in winter and ſpring, has hitherto been
tolerable. The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza</hi> of laſt ſpring continued to depreſs me
half the ſummer. Would you think the verſes I incloſed were written on
that occaſion by a young journeyman ſhoemaker; and one that lives at the
village of Rowley, near me? He conſidered my diſorder in ſomewhat too
<hi>grave</hi> a light, as I did not think my life endangered by it; but,
allowing for this, and the <hi>partiality</hi> he ſhews <hi>me,</hi> you will
think the lines pretty extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary for one of <hi>his occupation.</hi> They
are not, however, the <hi>only,</hi> or, perhaps, the <hi>chief</hi>
ſpecimens of his genius; and yet, before he came to me, his principal
knowledge was drawn from <hi>Magazines.</hi> For theſe two or three years
paſt, I have lent him Claſſics, and other books in Engliſh. You ſee,
to <hi>him,</hi> I am a great Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas; although you and my friend expect me
to become an author by ſubſcription.—On this head I will ſay no
more at <hi>preſent,</hi> than that I am infinitely obliged by your extreme
friendly offers. My friend G—, who knows my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, has
ſometimes the honour of waiting on you; I ought not, therefore, after this
tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous epiſtle, to begin to trouble you with a written explanation of them.

               <salute>Dear Mr. Jago,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY laſt letter muſt have been confuſed, and the arrival of it,
I fear, uncertain.</p>
            <p>The hare and birds in one of the pictures which you ſent me, I
think, are well. The other parts of it indifferent. They grey hound worſt of
all. The portrait is by no means equal to its companion, either in beauty of
the perſon, or ſkill of the painter; yet it matches ſo well with the
other, that I find my parlour very much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed by it. Pardon the
freedom with which I criticiſe your preſent; and accept once more my very
thankful acknowledgements.</p>
            <p>I am truly glad to find ſo worthy a Nobleman, and ſo warm a
friend of yours, as my Lord Willoughby is, made a Lord of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>I have heard nothing ſince I wrote laſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to
<hi>my</hi> affair; though I expect to do ſo every day. I have ſuch a tribe
of humours and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities, that it is eaſier to make me rich than to make
me happy; and ten to one that the favour will not be conferred without
diſguſting ſome of theſe ſaid humours, &amp;c. However, one muſt
make the beſt of it; and reflect, that mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in one place may
preclude mortifications in another.</p>
            <p>I go to-morrow, by appointment, to Enville; where I may probably
ſtay till Saturday. I have wiſhed moſt heartily for a copy of your Fable
to take with me; but Dodſley has not yet returned that I ſent him. Pray
conſider my propoſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations rather as hints than real improvements,
and let me have a copy as ſoon you can. I wrote my criticiſm over twice,
and know not whether I ſent the beſt or the worſt copy; ſo I ſend the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1250901200:296"/> other, though perhaps much the ſame. I forgot to
particularize many ſhining parts in your little Fable, that are either
elegant or humourous: of the former ſort, nothing could be happier than what
you ſay about H—: as it touches, in the <hi>gentleſt</hi> manner, on
a poſſible truth, which, if expreſſed rather than implied, might not be
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inoffenſive. This beauty is produced by ſubſtituting H— inſtead
of L—, the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the proprietor.</p>
            <p>I have lately read 
<q rend="inline">"The Death of Abel."—</q>It is not void of
merit; but might have been made much more pathetic by a more ſimple and
proſaic ſtyle.</p>
            <p>I deſire my beſt reſpects to Mrs. Jago and your
family.—May not I ſee you here this Chriſtmas? as I wiſh to do,
becauſe it is the ſeaſon preſent; and not that I am not at all times
and at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons moſt unſeignedly glad to wait upon you, and moſt
affectionately your ever faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:

            <p>I AM ſuſpicious that my letters (of which I have ſent two) do
not reach you by the way <pb n="270" facs="tcp:1250901200:297"/> of Warwick. This is meant as an
experiment whether they will arrive by way of Southam. It is meant withall to
remind you of perfecting your little Fable, and diſpatching it to me as
ſoon as may be. I would fain tranſmit a copy to Lord S—'s, before the
family ſeparates, or leaves Enville; by whom, I am ſure, it would be
admired.</p>
            <p>I am juſt returned from a viſit which I made there, and four or
five days paſſed very happily. At coming away, I ſhewed my Lord two or
three of Mr. D—'s laſt letters, which laid open to him the ſcheme
that was carrying on for me. I requeſted alſo, if there ſhould be
occaſion (which there poſſibly might <hi>not</hi>) that he would allow me
the honour of being known to him. He ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"he was glad to find what was going forward; and had
long wiſhed to ſee ſomething of that ſort begun before: that he
ſhould be in town, I think, in February; and would do me any ſervice in his
power. He deſired me alſo to acquaint Mr. D— (in alluſion to the
latter's uncertainty about my Lord's political connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that he thought it
the duty of every honeſt man to ſupport the preſent Government; and that
he ſhould continue his regard for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſo long as he ſaw
nothing in his meaſures that was prejudicial to his Country."</q>
