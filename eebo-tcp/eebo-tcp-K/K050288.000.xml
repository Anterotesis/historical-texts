            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN order to enquire Critically into the
Reaſon and Juſtice, as well as Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
of an <hi>Occaſional Bill,</hi> or an
Act to prevent the Occaſional Conformity
of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> it ſeems neceſſary to ſtate
as diſtinctly, and in a Method as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable
as may be, the <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>Original</hi> of the Thing call'd <hi>Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
and by what Steps the preſent
Debates about it, have come upon the
Stage.</p>
            <p>That this may be done with as little Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as poſſible, we ſhall deduce things in
a brief Hiſtorical Narration from undoubted
Teſtimony of Fact, recent to the Memory
of moſt obſerving Men in this Age, and
not to be contradicted by the falſe Gloſſes
or Miſrepreſentations of any: And if by
this it ſhould appear, that the following
are undoubted Truths of unqueſtion'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0421902000:3"/>
then all the Vehemence which ſome
have uſed, in preſenting the ſeveral Acts
againſt <hi>Occaſional Conformity,</hi> will appear ſo
many Attempts, <hi>Whether knowingly or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
is not to the Purpoſe,</hi> againſt the
Conſtitution, and againſt the juſt Right of
their Country; <hi>That is to ſay,</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If it it appears, That the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
called <hi>The Teſt-Act,</hi> has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by the Siniſter Deſigns of a Party
among us, and being in its true Intent and
Meaning formed againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſants
only, has been turned againſt our Fellow
Proteſtants, to the weakning and injuring
the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion in
general in this Kingdom;</item>
               <item>2. If it appears, That it is a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
in its own Nature, and inconſiſtent
with the Native Rights of the Subjects of
<hi>England,</hi> as well as with the Sovereignty
of Conſcience, which ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon;</item>
               <item>3. If it appears inconſiſtent with the
Chriſtian Religion, and with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4.
If the manner in which it is put in
Practice appears to be a Plot againſt the
Peace of the Nation, and a conſtant Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0421902000:4"/>
to the Strife of Parties, and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Innocent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>If upon an Impartial Enquiry into the
Hiſtory of this Law, theſe things ſhould
appear, then it may be worth our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
whether we ſhould ſtill purſue a
thing ſo fatal to the General Good, and be
for ever Sacrificing one another to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of Parties, robbing each other of
the Peace, Liberty, and Birthright of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men,</hi>
under the Forms, but contrary
to the true Intent and Meaning of the
Law.</p>
            <p>From this ſhort Introduction, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to lay theſe Things more plainly before
us, That <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants may ſee what
they are doing, and may not ſacrifice one
another to the Intereſts of the Enemies of
both; We proceed to ranſack from the
Beginning, the Records of theſe Things,
that the Truth being brought forth into a
clear Light, and viewed with open unblind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Eyes, the preſent Generation may have
none to blame but themſelves, if they pull
down the Liberties and Religion of their
Anceſtors with their own Hands.</p>
            <p>After the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
had been for ſome Years perfected, and the
Court as well as the Kingdom was gotten
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0421902000:5"/>
over their firſt Tranſports, enjoy'd a full
Dominion over the <hi>Puritan-Party,</hi> as they
call'd them, and had for two or three Years
ſuppreſſed the Remains of them by ſevere
Proſecutions of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> ſuppreſſing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,</hi>
Fining, Impriſoning, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcating
the Hearers, and Baniſhing, as
by the Corporation-Act, their Miniſters
or Preachers Five Miles from every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Town, and the like; the Nobility
and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> began to ſee, that
while their Eyes had been taken up with
purſuing theſe leſſer Evils of <hi>Schiſm</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
among Proteſtants, they had, as the
Conſequence of ſuch Proceedings generally
proves, inſenſibly ſuffered the ſecret En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
of <hi>Rome</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> and
opened a Door to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be too tedious a thing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
here, what all our Hiſtories are full
of, <hi>viz.</hi> To give an Account by what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
Degrees the King (influenc'd by the
Council of his Brother a declared <hi>Papist,</hi>
and by his own Reſolutions, himſelf as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
at his Death, being ſecretly a <hi>Papist,</hi>
an Account whereof ſhall in theſe Tracts be
at large made Publick) ſuffer'd himſelf and
all his Councils to be acted and managed
by the Artifice of <hi>France,</hi> and being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Penſioner to the King of <hi>France,</hi>
brought his whole Kingdom to be paſſively
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0421902000:6"/>
ſubſervient, and actively aſſiſtant to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Exorbitance of that Prince, whoſe
Power ſo aſſiſted, has ſince grown too great
for all <hi>Europe,</hi> and has coſt this ſame Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whoſe Blood and Valour aſſiſted them,
<hi>to riſe</hi> ſo much Blood and Treaſure ſince
<hi>to reduce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length, tho' late, the People of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
took the Alarm, when in the Year
1672, the King of <hi>France</hi> made that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eruption into <hi>Holland,</hi> attacking the
<hi>Dutch</hi> with three formidable Armies at once,
without any Provocation, any Satisfaction
demanded, or Cauſe aſſign'd, ſave that he
was ill ſatisfied in them.</p>
            <p>At the firſt of this War we wretchedly
aſſiſted <hi>France,</hi> not only by Land, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
War againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by Sea, in a manner too diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to ſay much of, <hi>viz.</hi>
falling upon their <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, while in
full Peace they might be ſuppoſed to come
ſecurely into our Channel, if not into our
very Harbours. The reſt we chooſe to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with a Hand of Charity, rather than
expoſe the Nakedneſs of thoſe Times, more
than the Neceſſity of the preſent Argument
obliges us to.</p>
            <p>The Succeſſes of <hi>France</hi> againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi>
reduc'd the States to the Brink of Ruine,
and <hi>Naerden</hi> being taken by the Duke of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0421902000:7"/>
               <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> it was expected, that <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
which was but 12 Miles off, would
have ſent Deputies to make their Submiſſion
to <hi>France.</hi> But in this Interim the Maſſacre
of the <hi>de Witts,</hi> and the Ruine of the <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt</hi>
Faction intervening, the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
afterwards King <hi>William</hi> of Glorious
Memory, a Prince born for the Reſcuing
oppreſs'd Nations, and for a Refuge to the
Proteſtant Religion, was reſtor'd to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Affairs in <hi>Holland,</hi> revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Courage of the deſponding People,
and in a little time drove the <hi>French</hi> as faſt
out of the Country, as they came in.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, and the Progreſs of the
<hi>French</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> alarm'd <hi>England,</hi> as we
hinted above, and put us upon Enquiring
into our State at Home; Endeavours were
us'd to bring <hi>England</hi> over, and the Pulſe of
the People in Parliament beat ſo high againſt
<hi>France,</hi> that the Court was oblig'd to make
a ſhew of Changing Sides; Peace was made
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> an Offer of Marriage of the
Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> afterwards Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſeveral meaſures
taken, which look'd like a War with
<hi>France,</hi> tho' nothing leſs intended.</p>
            <p>An Army was rais'd, Three Millions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hundred thouſand Pounds given by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for the Carrying it on; but ſuch
hold had the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Councils
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0421902000:8"/>
gotten in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, that all the
Means which were poſſible to be uſed
could never get the King to Declare War,
but at laſt ended all in the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
a Peace wholly to the Advantage of
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the Patriots
of the Proteſtant Intereſt in this Nation,
finding the Influence which <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Emiſſaries had on the King, and finding
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords in the Houſe always vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to oppoſe every thing which was for
the advancing the new Meaſures, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
themſelves to ſeveral Methods, in
order to weaken the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party. They
could not yet obtain an Act to prevent the
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords Sitting in the Houſe, but the
preſent Caſe was to prevent <hi>Popiſh</hi> Officers
in the Army; who were ſo many, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
ſo Inſolently, that the Army then
raiſed and incamp'd at <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> under
a Pretence of the War with <hi>France,</hi> was
become a Terror to the People, and was
called the <hi rend="blackletterType">Cut-throat Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who till then had
been one of the Five Capital Letters, which
formed the Word CABAL, was the
Man who contriv'd and brought in the
Propoſal for a Bill to diſpoſſeſs theſe <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Officers: And the Title of the Act expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Meaning and Deſign of its being
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0421902000:9"/>
brought in. The King, the Court, and all
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, oppoſed it
with all their Might; but the Popular
Terror, and the juſt Fear the People were
in of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Army, prevailed, and it paſs'd
by a great Majority; neither did the King
think fit to oppoſe himſelf to the Stream of
the whole Nation at that time, eſpecially
there being a great Money-Bill then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
in the Houſe, for no leſs than
1238750<hi>l.</hi> which would have been loſt.
So the Bill paſs'd, 25 <hi>Carol.</hi> 2. and is Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
<hi>An Act for preventing Dangers which
may ariſe from Popiſh Recuſants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Famous <hi rend="blackletterType">Teſt-Act</hi>; and that
the true Intent and Meaning of this Act,
and the Reaſon of its making, may more
plainly appear, the Preamble to the Act is
thus; <hi rend="blackletterType">For Preventing Dangers which
may happen from Popiſh Recuſants,
and for quieting the Minds of His
Majeſties good Subjects</hi>; The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of His Majeſties good Subjects,</hi> was at
that time manifeſt to be their Fears of the
Army and Court being put into the Hands
of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the People who puſh'd on
the Act, were thoſe very People, who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing
Liberty and Property, obtain'd in
Contempt from the Court-Party the Name
of <hi rend="blackletterType">Whiggs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0421902000:10"/>
But further to explain this Matter, the
Court, which with all poſſible Management
and Art oppoſed this Law, endeavour'd to
alarm the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with their Danger
from this Act; and Alderman <hi>LOVE,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
for the City of <hi>London,</hi> a Man
of unſpotted Integrity, was privately ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, that he might oppoſe it on behalf
of the <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> This at firſt had ſome
Effect on the People; but Mr. <hi>Love</hi> ſeeing
into the Deſign avoided it, and would not
meddle; on the other hand, the Perſons
who brought in the Bill, aſſured the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
there was no Deſign to offer them
any Diſturbance, and that if they deſired
it, they would bring in another Bill after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to exempt them from the Penalties
of the ſaid Act, repreſenting to them at
the ſame time, That if they ſtruck in to
oppoſe this Act, the Bill againſt <hi>Popery</hi>
would be loſt, and both they and the Church
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould fall together, under the
growing Miſchiefs ariſing from the Power
of <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> prevailed upon with theſe
Arguments, and eſpecially depending upon
the Promiſes of the <hi>Church-men,</hi> (Unhappy
Credulity!) that the Act had no View
towards them, and ſhould in no wiſe be
turned upon them, acquieſc'd, and to ſave
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſacrific'd themſelves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0421902000:11"/>
and their Poſterity, to the Ingratitude of
thoſe that propoſed it to them. Juſt thus the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſuffered themſelves to
be prevailed upon in the ſame Caſe, rather
than to loſe that happy Bill laſt paſt there
to prevent the Growth of <hi>Popery;</hi> into the
middle of which, a certain Noble Perſon
then in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and lately become a
Convert to a <hi>Principle</hi> perfectly new to
what he formerly profeſt, thruſt into the
middle of that Act, thereby to throw out
all the Faithful Subjects of the Government,
who ſpent their Eſtates, and ſome of their
Blood in the Defence of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Army of King <hi>James,</hi>
from being truſted with the Magiſtracy of
the City they defended.</p>
            <p>In this manner, and on this Occaſion,
and no other, this Act was paſſed, which is
now become ſo much the Favourite of a
Party, as to be thought the great Defence
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> how and by
what Degrees it became ſo, may not be
improper to enquire.</p>
            <p>It was ſome Years after the firſt paſſing
of this Act, 'ere the Effects of it on the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> were much taken notice of; and
during the firſt 10 Years afterwards, the
Capitulation of thoſe Perſons who brought
it in was pretty well obſerved: And tho'
ſeveral Perſecutions happen'd in that time
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0421902000:12"/>
upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> by Virtue of other
Penal Laws which were turned againſt
them, yet this Part of the Law was not
much inſiſted on till about the Year 82,
and 83, when the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot being turn'd
into Ridicule, and ſeveral Plots trumped
up upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> partly to turn the
Odium of that Plot upon them, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſuppreſs them as a Party joyning with
the <hi rend="blackletterType">Whigs,</hi> eſpecially when the Court
undertook the modelling of Corporations,
and brought Writs of <hi>Quo-Warranto</hi> againſt
the Charters of Towns: Then this Law
was turned full-but upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and
with all imaginable Eagerneſs inſiſted upon,
even ſo much as to the Common-Council
Men of the City of <hi>London;</hi> nay, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to talk, or offer at, allowing no Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
to Vote for Common-Council Men
or Aldermen, but ſuch as had taken the
Sacrament; and to run it to all poſſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
they went this Length, That no
Man ſhould be allow'd a Licenſe to keep
an <hi>Ale-Houſe,</hi> unleſs he had taken the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Church; and ſeveral ſad
Stories are left upon Record, of Perſons
falling into Deſpair, Melancholy and
Madneſs, for having acted againſt their
Conſciences in that Caſe; till at laſt
it was ſaid, a poor profligate Wretch
found out an Expedient for it, and finding a
Prieſt with as little Religion as himſelf,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0421902000:13"/>
communicated with him, profeſſing to take
it as no Religious Act, for that he owned
he was not fit to do it; acknowledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Scandalous Sinner, but that being
forced to do it, or loſe his Licenſe, which
was his Livelyhood, he took it as common
Bread and Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are other
Scandalous Inſtances of the Severity of
thoſe Times, which we omit, being not
willing to aggravate the Grief of thoſe
things.</p>
            <p>By the publick Management of theſe
Times, this Act was thus brought on the
Stage, as if made on purpoſe for the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
while at the ſame time the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom it had really been made, were
upon every Occaſion forborn, conniv'd at,
and overlook'd; and all Attempts to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Law againſt them diſcourag'd and
diſcountenanc'd.</p>
            <p>This continued during the whole Reign
of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and in King <hi>James</hi>'s
Reign, till the Defeat of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
when the King in his Speech to the
Parliament, fairly told the Houſe, He could
not want the Service of the Gentlemen of
his own Religion, and openly Diſpenſing
with this Law in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> cajol'd the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> with their ſhare of the Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0421902000:14"/>
Some of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
were ſo far partial to their own Eaſe,
as not to conſider that it was given them at
the Expence of the Conſtitution, and that
their enjoying the Relaxation of Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
by the Breath of the King, was a
ſtopping their Mouths againſt the open
Breaches of the Law, and effectually taking
from them any Argument they might uſe
againſt the Diſpenſing Power, or the pulling
down all the Fortifications of our Laws
againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But
their Eyes were ſoon open'd, and
they ſaw the Miſtake time enough to
joyn heartily with the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
in reſtoring the Liberties of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and overthrowing the projected Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of <hi>Popery;</hi> and then followed the
<hi rend="blackletterType">Revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the whole Reign of King <hi>William,</hi>
the <hi>Teſt-Act</hi> ſlept in its Native Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
its firſt Deſign in keeping <hi>Papiſts</hi>
out of Publick Employment, out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
Army, and Civil Liſt, was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
anſwer'd: But the corrupt turning the
Edge upon the <hi rend="blackletterType">Diſſenters</hi> was diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd,
as what was <hi>not only</hi> not the
Intereſt of the Nation, but as what was not
the true Reaſon or Intent and Meaning
of the Bill. The King, who had a native
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0421902000:15"/>
Averſion to all Religious Coercion, had
alſo the leſs Inclination to puſh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of this Law upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
becauſe he knew in the Original Making
that Law, it was not in the View either of
the People, or of the Sovereign, to give them
the leaſt Diſturbance on that Account.</p>
            <p>Yet here the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> committed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Error; for as if they were eaſier in
their Compliance, in that they were not
at all compell'd, they voluntarily comply'd
with the Law, tho' they were ſure no Man
would meet with Encouragement in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
them for the Omiſſion; nor do we
find in all this time any Proſecution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
againſt any Proteſtant Diſſenter,
for taking or executing any Office or Place,
whether Civil or Military, without taking
the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>This obtain'd the Name of <hi rend="blackletterType">Occaſional
Conformity</hi>; but the Freedom with which
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> qualified themſelves, at their
entring into ſuch Offices, tho' there ſeem'd
no Danger in the Omiſſion, gave Offence;
firſt to their own Friends, eſpecially among
thoſe, who having a more ſtrict regard to
their Principles, look'd upon it as an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
with their profeſſed Diſſent from
the Church, who complained openly, that
ſuch who could on meer Occaſion of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
and to ſhun a Penalty Conform,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0421902000:16"/>
ought not to be receiv'd again into the
Communion of particular Congregations,
but as Penitents.</p>
            <p>There were many who took up the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
againſt this Objection, and thought to
maſter it with Arguments drawn from
General Charity: But however they might
prove the Legality of a Communion of
Charity with all Orthodox Chriſtians; or
a General Communion with the whole
Chriſtian Church; yet it is moſt certain,
no full Anſwer could be given to that
Part of <hi rend="blackletterType">Occaſional Conformity</hi> which
was ſubmitted to by Perſons otherwiſe
Diſſenting from the Church, meerly to
quality for Preferment and Places in the
Government, which was the Sum of the
Diſpute at that time.</p>
            <p>This Argument therefore being directly
againſt them, became exceeding Popular,
and eſpecially it appear'd a little new to
find the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> themſelves vigorouſly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
for <hi>Conformity</hi> to that very <hi rend="blackletterType">Church</hi>
which they ſtatedly ſeparated from.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was Her preſent Majeſty come to
the Crown, but the Enemies of the <hi>Toleration,</hi>
having as they thought, an opportunity to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> began here; They found
nothing ſo proper to render them hated
and odious to the People, as the Charge
of Hypocriſy, and therefore immediately
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0421902000:17"/>
took hold of this, as an Advantage
which offered againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and
that would make their Proceeding againſt
them popular and ſpecious: And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
the firſt <hi rend="blackletterType">Occaſional Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as all Extreams in the unhappy Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of this Nation, have been fatal to the
common Liberty of the whole, as well as to
the Parties themſelves, who run unadviſedly
into them: So here, as the <hi>Occcaſional Confor-</hi>
of thoſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in general, who run to
the Sacrament in that prophane manner,
meerly for a Qualification, grew ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and hateful, even to their own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
whoſe Conſciences were more ſtrictly
obey'd; ſo the abſolute reſtraining the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Occaſional Conforming, in all that
ſhould enjoy any Publick Employment,
tying them up from ever Communicating,
or ſo much as hearing a Sermon in a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Meeting,</hi> or indeed in any Foreign
Proteſtant Church, on Pain of loſing their
Employments and Livelyhood; this always
carry'd with it ſuch an Air of Cruelty,
ſuch an Invaſion of Native-Right, ſuch an
Oppreſſion of Conſcience, ſuch a viſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency
with the <hi rend="blackletterType">Toleration,</hi> and ſuch
a Degree of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that all the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Part, even of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
it ſelf, oppoſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0421902000:18"/>
How it was firſt introduced and paſs'd the
<hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> how it was ſent up to the
<hi>Lords</hi> for their Concurrence; how the
<hi>Lords</hi> return'd it but with one Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
relating to ſome Circumſtances
not eſſential to the Bill, and which the
Commons would gladly have quitted in
their ſubſequent Attempts; and yet how the
Commons adhering to their firſt Bill, and
the Lords inſiſting on their Amendment,
that Bill was loſt: How the next Seſſion,
a ſecond Bill was brought in, and ſent up to
the Lords, but the Temper of Perſecution
having loſt Ground, was thrown out by
the Peers by a great Majority: And <hi>laſtly,</hi>
how a third Bill was brought into the Houſe
of Commons, and loſt in their own Houſe
by the Attempt to Tack it to another Bill;
and how that Tacking Project not only
threw out the Bill, but even overthrew the
Party, that had been all along ſo forward
to promote it: Theſe are Things ſo well
known to every Man that has any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
upon him for the Publick, and the
Particulars have been made ſo public, that
we need do no more, than refer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Readers to the Papers which have
been already publiſhed on that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0421902000:19"/>
When after this by the late <hi rend="blackletterType">Court-Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> a new Turn was given to
all our Civil Affairs, and new Faces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in the Management; as the Warmth
of the <hi>High Church</hi> Party appear'd in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Extravagancies ſo unbounded, as we
had Reaſon to apprehend, that they could
be deny'd nothing, and knew they
would ſtick at nothing to raiſe their New
Party and effectually cruſh the Old, ſo it
was expected this old Affair ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.</p>
            <p>When
we ſay <hi>expected,</hi> 'tis needful to add
that it was expected by every Party: The
<hi>High Party</hi> expected it; they ſaid one to
another, That now was the happy Moment,
when it was in their Power entirely, not to
eſtabliſh the Church only, but ſo effectually
to cruſh the Intereſt of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as to
render it impoſſible for them ever to riſe
again, at leaſt ſo as to make themſelves
formidable to the Church.</p>
            <p>We might add here what that Party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
themſelves from the Reſtoration of
their Friends, the Elections having gone
generally in their favour; how they reduc'd
the <hi rend="blackletterType">Toleration</hi> to ſuch a Pitch, that they
would no more have it allow'd to be a <hi rend="blackletterType">To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi>
but an Exemption from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of certain Laws; how the Academies
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0421902000:20"/>
and Schools of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Proſecutions againſt ſome of them
actually begun; and how in all Places, they
began to threaten the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up their Meeting-Houſes, and in many
Places, rabbl'd, pull'd down, and burnt
their Meeting-Houſes; but this may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to a more proper Place; this may, we
hope, ſufficiently prove, That the Friends
of that Party made no queſtion, but that an
<hi rend="blackletterType">Occaſional Bill</hi> ſhould be immediately
brought in.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> teſtify'd early their juſt
Apprehenſions, when in the Hurry of this
Change at Court, and the coming in of a
New Party like a Flood; the Inſults in
their Perſons, the Injuries in their Houſes
and Meetings, the Abuſive Railing Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
and the Tumultuous carrying of all
kinds of Elections, againſt common Rules
of Modeſty and Decency, as well as Right,
made it Rational to them to think, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be ſo ſevere, but what they had
Reaſon to expect; and therefore that an
<hi rend="blackletterType">Occaſional Bill</hi> ſhould be Introduc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the next Parliament, to the Ruin of their
Liberty, was one of the leaſt Things which
they thought it was Reaſonable to fear.</p>
            <p>Even thoſe Gentlemen, who tho' willing
for other Reaſons, to join in the Changes
at Court, were yet of more Moderate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0421902000:21"/>
that were willing to have the late
Miniſtry depos'd, and admitted the New
Miniſtry, as a Means to ſuch other Ends as
they had in View, whether reſpecting this
or that View, yet unconcern'd with any
Religious Proſpects; Theſe, tho' they did
not approve of the Occaſional Bill, as what
they imagin'd needleſs to the Church, and
tending to encreaſe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſineſſes of the
People, which they having ſettled the New
Management of Civil Affairs, deſir'd to
bring to ſome ſettled Condition; yet it is
plain, expected the Occaſional Bill to be
puſh'd at the laſt Seſſion, and as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it, ſo they apply'd themſelves to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, and, as by the Conſequence appear'd,
did prevent it.</p>
            <p>It will be needleſs to bring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the Hot Men againſt theſe laſt; for
their fatal Moderation, as they call it, is an
Evidence, that theſe Men of Moderation
did effectually ſtop the Current of that Zeal,
or Heat, call it what you pleaſe, which
would have put forward ſuch a Bill: 'Tis
enough, that the Houſe of Commons go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
themſelves by Moderate Councils,
contrary to all the Expectations, Hopes, or
Fears, as above, offer'd nothing to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> abridg'd none of
their Liberties, nor encourag'd any of the
Heats without Doors, which would have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0421902000:22"/>
puſh'd at the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and the Seſſion
paſs'd over, with a Calmneſs, as exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mortifying to the Enemies of Peace, as
perhaps Surprizing to thoſe who had been
under Apprehenſions of other Uſage, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p>By
this happy Conduct, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to take Courage, Re-builded their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd
Meeting-Houſes, and promis'd to
themſelves, that as Her Majeſty had paſs'd
Her Royal Word, to preſerve <hi rend="blackletterType">Inviolable</hi>
their Privileges and Religious Liberty, they
ſhould enjoy the ſame, notwithſtanding the
former Fears, without any farther Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>When
on a ſuddain, from a Quarter
whence they expected nothing of that kind;
and from Hands, which they well hop'd
would, as they formerly had been, held up
in their Favour, the Storm ſeems to be Riſen,
by what ever Influence, and with what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Deſign rais'd, is not for us to Enquire

of the Apoſtle, <hi>We have many Things to ſay,
but you cannot bear them now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now come to that unhappy

given up by their Beloved Patriots,
Attack'd by thoſe, who they juſtly plac'd

            <p>This, we ſay, with Reſpect to thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who to Congratulate the New Converts
that come over to a Party, are pleas'd to ſee

relating to Power, Management, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration:
We are ſpeaking now of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
without Doors, for of the Parliament
and Proceedings within Doors, we may not

            <p>But above all, it ſeems Aſtoniſhing to
Unbyaſs'd Judgments, to find even the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>

Bondage, than they us'd to be;
willing to pleaſe themſelves with Hopes, that
the Hands that this comes from, cannot be
ſuppos'd to hurt them; willing to amuſe

now depending, is differing from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and leſs ſevere; that it is qualified with
ſome Circumſtances which makes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends;
that it includes a farther Security to

            <p>Alas poor People! When are ye to open

to reſtore you to your Underſtanding?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0421902000:24"/>
What are you doing? If the preſent Bill is
Qualified with ſome Clauſes for your better

thin Leaf of glittering Metal; if there are
not all the ſevere Things which you were
formerly Attack'd with in this; Do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
Comfort from this? Or ought you not
the rather to ſee the certainty of what is to

            <p>The preſent Parliament are, perhaps, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

Threatned with, and you are pleas'd
with the Negative of your Miſeries, and
Thankful that it is no worſe.</p>
            <p>But have you look'd at the Formidable

Have you Enquir'd into their New Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?
How having, as before, miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0421902000:25"/>
Fatal is their Policy, to wheedle you in!
they take hold of your Party Animoſities,
and ſend over their <hi>Huſhai's</hi> to Counterfeit
a Revolt to you, and to bring in your Eaſie
and Impolitick Leaders, into Meaſures with

of your Religious Liberties; and thus
you are drawn in by the Spies and Cheats of

            <p>Poor
unhappy blinded People! Supinely
ſitting down pleas'd with the Ruin of your

thoſe People whom you Rely ſo ſteadily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

their Opinion is not with you, ſo it can be

of the Memorial to the P. of <hi>O . . . ?</hi> Or
is not this opening a Door, at which the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent

the Intereſt of the Church, and are

But is not the reſtleſs purſuit of the Ruin

            <p>It cannot be conſtrued a Reflection upon
the Parliament, without manifeſt Injuſtice,
to ſay, that others may have Abhorr'd
Deſtructive Proſpects, in Contriving what
theſe may have no View but the general
Good in their Enacting; for the Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt
Laws have been perverted to the moſt
wicked Purpoſes; as Eſtabliſhments of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Right to Oppreſſion; Corporation-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
to Monopoly; Royal Prerogative
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0421902000:27"/>
to Tyranny, and Church Settlements to
Perſecution; and therefore while we charge
the Party who aim at the Ruin of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
to be at the Bottom of every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
againſt the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> we no more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

than when we clear the Parliament of any

to acquit the Contrivers and Party, who
promote on all Occaſions the Ruin of the
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> Liberty.</p>
            <p>That the preſent Bill depending in the
Houſe, may be with fewer Reſtrictions than
the laſt; That there may be ſome Clauſes
in Favour of the Toleration, we cannot
ſay but all this may be true, and the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Juſtice of the Houſes, are ſo far
your Safety; but are there not Clauſes in
the ſame Law, which leſſen the Liberties
which the Act of Toleration either Granted
you, or which were your Right in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Act of Toleration, or which
are the Native Rights of <hi>Engliſh-Men?</hi> Are
there no Clauſes which break in upon that
Liberty of Conſcience, which we have ſo
long inſiſted upon as a Right which no
Humane Power ought to Invade? Are there
no Branches of Perſecution in it? Are there
no Powers given to your Enemies to Inſult
and Oppreſs your Conſciences? Are there
no poor Innocent Men, who muſt forego
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0421902000:28"/>
their Employments, and ſtarve their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
or act againſt Conſcience to feed
them? Are there no innocent People who
muſt be driven from the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to the
<hi>Church</hi> meerly for Subſiſtence? Or which
is ſtill worſe, are there no Conſcientious
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> who muſt now periſh and ſtarve,
becauſe they cannot totally Conform, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to quit their Employments,
becauſe they cannot in meer Conſcience
comply? If none of theſe Things are in
the Bill it is well: but if there are, Let
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> flatter themſelves as much
they will, that thoſe on whoſe Favour and
Judgment they ſo much depend, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce
in the Bill: Let them pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as much as they will in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Bill, That this or that which
was ſevere in the late Bill, was not in
this; they will find, let this be as mild
as it will, it is yet ſo much the nearer
to the Perſecution which the Party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
'tis yet a Step forwarder to the
approaching Evil that waits behind; the
ſlower the Poiſon, the ſurer the Operation;
the lingring Conſumption is moſt certain
to kill, and the <hi rend="blackletterType">Toleration</hi> which is the

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0421902000:29"/>
Nor is the Slumber of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and
the Lethargy that is upon them as to this
Matter, the leaſt of their Danger, when
they are ſo divided in Intereſts, heated
with Animoſities, and engaged in Parties,
that too many among them are willing to
give up any thing, and fall in with any Body,
ſo they can but ſtrengthen the Party Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
they purſue: This is a fore-boding
Signal of the Ruin of their Intereſt, we
ſpeak not meerly with reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Heats that rage among us, but for
ſeveral Years paſt, this has been the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Temper.</p>
            <p>And how elſe could they now rejoyce in,
and propoſe Things to themſelves from the
ſeeming Converſion or Revolt, or what you
will call it, of a Perſon known thro' many
Years of Publick Conduct, to bear a profeſs'd
Averſion to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Revolution,</hi> to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the King, to the whole Body, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and very Name of a <hi>Diſſenter?</hi> Is it
for this Man and his very few Dependents,
that we are ſo willing to Sacrifice the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of Two Millions of Her Majeſty's
Subjects? Is it to gain a Man who no Side
ever thought capable of Buſineſs, whoſe
Intereſt never put an Ounce in the Scale
of Parties, but who has been the Deriſion
of all Sides, and the Contempt even of his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0421902000:30"/>
own Houſe? Is it for this Man's Favour
that a whole Party ſhould deviate from
their Ancient Steadineſs, and give up the
Rights and Privileges of their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</p>
            <p>We look upon an Attempt of this Nature,
to be a Plot upon the <hi rend="blackletterType">Whigs</hi> in general,
and their Intereſt as a Party, as well as
upon the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and this Plot is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them, and no doubt but it will have
the deſir'd Effect. For will the <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
ever truſt a <hi rend="blackletterType">Low Church Whig</hi> again,
when they find that theſe have turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in ſuch a manner as this, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the other Party, put their Hands to
ſuch a Work as this, ſmiling to the <hi rend="blackletterType">Tories,</hi>
with <hi>JEH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, Come, ſee our Zeal for the
Church!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could there ever be a more effectual
Step to divide the Intereſt of the Whigs?
Can one Party ever betray another but
it leſſens their Confidence one in another
for ever after? Will a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Safety again in the Breaſt of a
<hi>Church Whig?</hi> Or will a <hi>Church Whig</hi> ever
believe a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> can truſt him with his
Liberty after this? And do not the Enemy
percieve it?</p>
            <p>Were there no Man of <hi>Moderation</hi> left
among the whole Body to have recourſe to,
to ſave Us? And when did this happen? Had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0421902000:31"/>
it been when a Majority of <hi>High Flying</hi>
Intereſt had Govern'd in the . . . . . . . it
might have been expected; but when we
boaſted of the contrary to an Extream, to
have this Storm ariſe from that Quarter!
O <hi>Hominem!</hi> O <hi>Mores!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſhould any Man wonder, That a
<hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi> is added to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
we have, of the Progreſs of the
Affair we are upon? How ſhould it be
expected that any one ſhould contradict
what thoſe alone, who it was always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ſhould oppoſe it, had conſented to
do, nay and as we are told, were the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals,
<hi>I had almoſt ſaid worſe,</hi> in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Introduction of it into the . . . .</p>
            <p>It might be expected here, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſhould be ſaid to the Matter, of the
preſent Bill depending: But there may be
more time for that, and a Time more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>It
may ſuffice at preſent, to ſpeak a
little to the General Deſign of a <hi>Bill,</hi> or
<hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> againſt <hi>The Occaſional
Conformity of Diſſenters,</hi> whether it reſpects
this Bill or no, and a little of that <hi>Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Conformity</hi> it ſelf, as they relate to
what has been formerly Tranſacted in
both Houſes of Parliament upon that
Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0421902000:32"/>
We have not the leaſt View in this to
plead for the Occaſional Conformity of the
Diſſenters, as it relates to a meer Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
a Practice which it is manifeſt few
of the Diſſenters defend, which they are
very much come off from, and which has
done much more Prejudice to the Diſſenters
themſelves, than to the Church. But it ſeems
abſolutely neceſſary in common Juſtice, to
diſtinguiſh here between a voluntary ill Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of a few, and a Law to diveſt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
either of his Civil or Religious Right.</p>
            <p>We find many People, who by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Practice, tho' diſſenting in Worſhip,
and in many things relating to Diſcipline,
Church-Government and Ceremony, have
yet held it as a Point of Conſcience, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Communion of Charity with the
Church; others, tho' they do not chooſe to
Communicate with the Church, yet in ſuch
Caſes where the Law requires it, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bound in Conſcience, <hi>as they are to ſhew
Obedience to the Laws,</hi> to comply with that
Occaſionally, which ſtatedly, they cannot do;
theſe we call <hi>Conſcientious Conformers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe things are meerly Matter of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
then oppreſſing theſe Men muſt be
the higheſt of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which <hi>Perſecution</hi>
was cenſur'd in the Preamble to the firſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Bill, to be <hi>contrary to the Principle
of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Doctrine</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0421902000:33"/>
               <hi>of the Church of</hi> England: And it is to be
noted here, as well worth our Reflection,
that both the firſt and ſecond <hi>Occaſional Bills</hi>
were rejected, becauſe they were look'd upon
to be a Degree of <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot but think 'tis always reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to diſtinguiſh, between preventing an
evil Practice, and taking away a Civil Right,
and that this is the Caſe here, no Body will
diſpute.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters have injury enough, in
that they are by the Letter of the Law, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Intent and Meaning of the whole
Legiſlature at the time of its making,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the common Privileges in Society
with their Fellow-Subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſerving
the Publick, and receiving the Reward of
their Prince, for the Expreſſions of their
Zeal and Loyalty in the publick Service; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
upon the unhappy Condition of doing
that (which as Diſſenters) they may be not
ſuppoſed capable to do.</p>
            <p>But to lay ſo ſevere an Injunction, That
if ever they touch any publick Employ, they
ſhall never go to hear a Sermon again, or to
communicate again in a Meeting-Houſe.
This is Perſecution with a witneſs, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to do any thing, which is againſt our
Conſcience to do, otherwiſe, tho' lawful in
itſelf, <hi>is Perſecution;</hi> to reſtrain from doing
what is in it ſelf lawful, and we may think
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0421902000:34"/>
to be Duty to do, <hi>is Perſecution;</hi> and all the
Puniſhment inflicted in theſe Caſes, <hi>is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi>
in the Abſtract.</p>
            <p>It has been ſo often argu'd, that this is
no Service to the Church, or to the High
Party, that this Argument ſeems perfectly
uſeleſs to be repeated; but we cannot but
take notice, that all the Acts hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
have not ſeem'd to have an Eye to the
Church, but to the Civil Preferments; not
to bring the Diſſenters over to the Church,
but to keep them out of the Offices of Profit.
There lies the true Aim in all this matter;
and this has been ſo viſible in all the former
Practice, that it needs little Explanation.</p>
            <p>Had the Deſign been purely the bringing
the Diſſenters over to the Church, they would
let it alone where it is, ſince nothing is more
certain than this, that the Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Diſſenters has done more towards
bringing all their Poſterity into the Church,
than all the Coecive Laws, Penal Statutes,
or other Violence in the World could ever
do; and it is moſt remarkable, that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeaking, where-ever the Parents have
been Occaſional Conformiſts, the Children
have been total Conformiſt. So that this
Liberty taken by the Diſſenters, has been
the Ruin of their Strength, the breaking of
the principal Families of their Party, and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0421902000:35"/>
indifferency of one Age has terminated the
diſſenting of the next.</p>
            <p>This the High Church Men are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, and it is mention'd for this Reaſon,
<hi>viz.</hi> To prove, that were the true Intereſt
of the Church regarded in this Caſe, or at
leaſt were that true Intereſt the End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in theſe things, they would entirely let
the Diſſenters alone. But the Deſign in theſe
things is ſo far from that, is ſo remote from
a Religious View, that it all centers in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Parties, keeping Poſts of Profit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and if poſſible, keeping the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out of them; and which is yet worſe,
the Aim is at a dividing the Intereſt of the
Whiggs, which being link'd to that of the
Diſſenters, has been too formidable for them
to deal with; but if the Low Church Men
can be brought to give up the Diſſenters—What
then! Why they ſhall have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour—of
what? Of being devour'd laſt,
and that is all they can promiſe themſelves.</p>
            <p>And will the Low Church Men give up
the Diſſenters? Will they make a Sacrifice
of the Conſciences of their Brethren, to gain
a ſmall Addition to their Party Intereſt?
What can be ſaid to them? We crave leave
to remind them of two or three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How long do ye think the New Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
you are making will laſt, upon ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0421902000:36"/>
ill a Foundation built? How far can you
go along with the New Converts you are
bringing over, either they muſt turn
Whigs, or you muſt turn High Flyers?
The firſt can never be but by Project,
and purpoſe to trick and deceive you;
and the laſt can never be but by unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
and moſt judicial Blindneſs;
and if theſe cannot be, then you cannot
go far together.</item>
               <item>2. When they and you part, and they go
back to their own Party, you having in
the higheſt manner provok'd the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
are you able to ſtand the Ground
againſt Popery and High Flying mad
Men by your ſelves?</item>
               <item>3. Remember the time when you were
laſt try'd, and conſider that two things
will ſuit your preſent Caſe. (1.) That
when you were try'd with Popery and
Slavery, the one from a Popiſh Prince,
the other from <hi>French</hi> Maxims of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
what was your Caſe? Were
you able to ſtand your Ground alone?
were you not ſenſible of the impoſſibility
of it? And (2.) when you were ſenſible
of the contrary, and made ſolemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
to the Diſſenters to ſtand by
you, and join with you, did the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
abandon you? Did they make
their Court to King <hi>James</hi> at your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0421902000:37"/>
as it is evident they might have
done, and were courted by the King to
do? In ſhort, did they ſerve you then,
as they are ſerved by you? No; they
reſiſted all the Careſſes of Popery and
and Paſſive-Obedience, Tories, and
choſe Affliction and Hazard with that
very Church of <hi>England,</hi> that now are for
denying them the leaſt publick Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
from that Government they have
ſpent their Blood and their Money to
ſupport?</item>
            </list>
            <p>Are theſe the Men you will now Sacrifice
to the private Views you have of a Party-Strength?
Are theſe the Returns to the
Diſſenters, for the putting themſelves into
your Hands? Is this the Temper promiſed
them at the Revolution? Is this the Juſtice
to their adhering ſo vehemently to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Intereſt, in the late Changes of thoſe
that are now making a Market of them?
Honeſt <hi>Coleman!</hi> Thou haſt loſt the moſt
effectual and undiſputed Axiom of Political
Philoſophy that ever was deliver'd at the
Gallows; <hi rend="blackletterType">No Truſt in Man!</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

Turn we our Eyes up to Heaven, from

ſtoned him, after all the great Things his
Father had done for them; <hi>The Lord look
upon it, and require it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can the Spirit of common Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
forbear to ſay, without Reſpect or Claim
to Prophecies, This cannot end but in the
ſinking of that very Party, who by this
Treatment of an innocent People, ſeek to
Eſtabliſh their Intereſt even with the very
Men they always abhorr'd. They will ſink
under the Weight of the Party they Careſs,
and this <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſhall be to them as a Staff,
which whoever leaneth thereon, it ſhall pierce
thro' their Hand, and the Deliverance of the
Diſſenters ſhall come ſome other way.</p>
            <p>But we are told here ſeveral Things, to
buoy us up under the Weight of what we
ſee coming upon us; ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Bill now depending in Parliament,
tho' it may reſtrain the Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Diſſenters, as to Places, yet
it gives you more than the Equivalent
in many Things; it confirms the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
it reſtores the Act of Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to the Name of the Toleration,
which it had loſt; it checks the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it is not extended
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0421902000:39"/>
in many Things, which were included
in the former Act.</item>
               <item>2. It was brought in from a Proſpect of
meer Kindneſs to the Diſſenters, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Deſign of another Party, who
had projected one tenfold worſe, and
which had been perfectly ruinous to the
Diſſenters Intereſt, and had in effect
turn'd the Toleration out of Doors.
And both theſe evidence that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
are not given up, or betray'd, or
ſacrific'd, as above.</item>
            </list>
            <p>We anſwer briefly to this, that, <hi>as before,</hi>
We are not debating what Favour the Two
Houſes of Parliament may grant in the Bill
now depending. It is not for us to ſay here
we are ſpeaking <hi>of</hi> or <hi>to</hi> that Bill, or to the
Houſes of Parliament; but we are ſpeaking
to thoſe People, whom we call <hi>Whigs without
Doors,</hi> who are concern'd in, or agree to
bringing any Bill in, or putting forward any
Law, to reſtrain the Conſciences of Innocent
Men, and take from them at the ſevere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the loſs of their Employments, the
Liberty of ſerving God, according to their
Conſciences: If the Parliament have ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this bitter Potion with any Negatives;
with any Favours, We are for being thankful
for all Favours, but We are not to think our
ſelves oblig'd at all to any of thoſe People,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0421902000:40"/>
               <hi>if any ſuch are,</hi> who having it in their Power
to prevent it, have put us into the Condition
to ſeek or be glad of ſuch Favours.</p>
            <p>And let thoſe Favours be what they will,
if the Clauſe excluding all thoſe from the
Natural Privilege of <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> and from
the Favours of their Sovereign, who cannot,
<hi>how Conſciencious ſoever their Scruples are,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the <hi>Church:</hi> We may without Offence
ſay, we ſhould not be at all the leſs thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be without the ſaid Favours, having
but at the ſame time the Liberty to be
without the Grievance.</p>
            <p>As to what is called <hi>Confirming our To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi>
if we think it ſufficiently Confirm'd
before, and in a moſt Sacred Manner Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
beſides the Act of Parliament, in
the Sanction of Her Majeſty's Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
from the Throne, of preſerving it
<hi rend="blackletterType">Inviolable:</hi> We hope it will not be ill
taken, if we ſay, We do not ſee how it can
be better Confirm'd, tho' every Seſſion of

are or can be paſs'd, ſince one Parliament
may Repeal what ever Acts another has

we have ſo much Dependance upon, as

we cannot prevail upon our ſelves to ſay,
We deſire any further Confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament in their printed

reſtor'd the Act for the Liberty of <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
to the true Title and Denomination
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi rend="blackletterType">Toleration, vide</hi> the <hi>Votes,

be thankful for, <hi>viz. An Act to reſtrain
the Conſciences of Men, in the Affair of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
Offices, without renouncing the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God in their own way, and according to the
Dictates of their Conſciences.</hi> For this we
can no more be thankful, than to a Judge
who pronounces Sentence of Death againſt
us for Crimes we think our ſelves not guilty
of.</p>
            <p>That we had as <hi>Diſſenters</hi> a Legal <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
before, by Act of Parliament, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That the Act Intitled, <hi>An Act to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
Her Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> &amp;c.
is a <hi>Toleration,</hi> is out of all queſtion true,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0421902000:42"/>
and to prove it, The Title to this Act now
paſſing is my Authority, being the Words
of the Parliament, Lords and Commons,
in whoſe Name, and by whoſe very Mouths
<hi>S . . . . . . l</hi> is thus pronounc'd an Impoſtor
and a Deceiver.</p>
            <p>We might Addreſs our ſelves now to
ſpeak to the Act it ſelf, and examine Two
Things in it, and which ſhall be done with
Brevity and Modeſty.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Will this Act anſwer the End which
is pretended in the Title, <hi>viz. To ſecure
the Church of England?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Will it anſwer the particular View of
thoſe who acquieſce in it, in hopes of
obtaining by it their Party-Ends, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Meaſures taken for a Peace?</item>
               <item>3. Will this Act anſwer the Two other
Ends, confirm the <hi>Toleration,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the <hi>Succeſſion?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Will it anſwer the End which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the Title, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>ſecure the Church
of England;</hi> To this I give the Opinion of
all thoſe Gentlemen, whoſe Speeches are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Record, againſt the firſt and ſecond
<hi rend="blackletterType">Occaſional-Bill,</hi> where it ſeems manifeſt,
at leaſt, That it was all their Opinion, that
this Law would bring no real Addition to
the <hi>Church,</hi> only ſerve to keep the Body of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0421902000:43"/>
               <hi>Diſſenters</hi> more united: And if we might
add in this Caſe, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> may in time
be found the only Caſe, in which the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
can be formidable to the <hi>Church:</hi> The
divided Condition of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> their
vain Truſts in the <hi>Great Men</hi> who they
thought were their <hi>Protectors,</hi> their frequent
Acceſs to Favours and Fortunes; theſe have
all along been the Foundation of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters;
their Dependance upon <hi>Great Men</hi>
elevated them, made them ſecure, divided
them, made them deſpiſe Caution and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and made them ſelf-intereſted, narrow,
and reſerv'd; <hi>in ſhort,</hi> it bury'd what they
call a Publick Spirit among them; this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd
them in their Real Strength to that
Degree, that inſtead of making them For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
it made them Deſpicable; ſo that
indeed the Liberty and Occaſional Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Diſſenters, has been their Ruin, has
been the Weakning their Strength, Leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Numbers, and Deſtroying their
Intereſt; and in all theſe have been, <hi>if the
Proſperity of the Diſſenters is the Churches
Danger,</hi> a Safety to the Church. Now
will this Reſtraint anſwer the Churches
End, as it is propos'd? It is impoſſible;
neither is it Calculated for that End, ſince
as is before Noted, the Deſign is not to
bring the Diſſenters over to the Church,
but to keep them out of Places: But if
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0421902000:44"/>
alarm'd by this Treatment, the Diſſenters
ſhould more firmly Unite, act in Concert,
recover the Reputation of their Integrity
and Sincerity, as if they are wiſe they may,
they will add weight to their Intereſt, and
the End of their mighty Struggle will be
quite Defeated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Will it anſwer the End of thoſe, who
by it puſh at breaking the Meaſures of the
Court, as to Peace or War?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not in the leaſt.</hi> The Intereſt they had
this way is entirely divided by it; Mutual
Confidence is Deſtroy'd, <hi>Irretrievably De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,</hi>
and can never be Reſtor'd. When
Men Truſt and Confide in one another, and
then Decieve one another, they <hi>ſeldom,</hi> but
in Parties and Sets of Men <hi>Never</hi> Truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
they may join Out-ſides, tho' that
will be Difficult, but In-ſides Never: Now
if the Concert is broken, which <hi>when whole</hi>
could not withſtand the Meaſures above,
how ſhould they do it when Divided?
No Strength encreaſes by being ſeparated;
<hi>Vis Unita Fortior,</hi> is an Old and True Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,
to ſay <hi>Vis ſeparata Fortior,</hi> would be a
groſs Abſurdity; Can any one be ſo weak
to think that the Intereſt of the Whigs and
Diſſenters, which is miſerably Torn and
Diſmembred by this Myſtery of Politicks,
can be able to do that now which they could
not do before? Where are the Legions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0421902000:45"/>
added to their Strength by this New Step?
Where is the Equivalent they Recieve?
<hi>Ridiculus Mus!</hi> A poor empty unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
<hi>Hero,</hi> Whoſe Intereſt has not been
able to Draw his own Brethren, the Sons of
his Mother, into his Meaſures. Nay, whoſe
Meaſures Unconcerted and Undetermin'd,
have hardly amounted to a Clear Propoſal—Where
are the Preliminaries of this mighty
Treaty? Truly the Whigs have done as
the King of <hi>France</hi> was to do, firſt evacuate
the Towns, and then let the Confederates
make their Demands, ſo they have firſt eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
their Friends, ſurrendred the Faith
they had Pledg'd to the Diſſenters, and now
the Tories may make their Demands, and if
it be to give up the Toleration next, we do
not ſee how theſe can deny them; ſo that
in ſhort, the End is as Uncertain as it was
before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Will this Act Confirm the Toleration?</hi>
Becauſe the Houſe ſays <hi>it ſhall,</hi> we will not
ſay <hi>it ſhall not;</hi> but God forbid we ſhould
ſay <hi>it will,</hi> while we ſee not the leaſt room
for any thing of that Kind: This Act and
a Hundred more of this Nature, being all
attended with this Circumſtance, That they
may be Repeal'd by the Breath of the Houſe,
who gives them Life. <hi>As to the Succeſſion
being Secured,</hi> by excluding a few <hi>Jacobites</hi>
out of the <hi>Faculty</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0421902000:46"/>
are capable of doing little Miſchief, unleſs
they were likewiſe excluded out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
of the Peace in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where
their Power is capable of doing things Fatal
to the Succeſſion, as may be proved by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Inſtances, We cannot have ſo much
value for that Clauſe as others have. As to
<hi>Confirming the Toleration,</hi> We will not ſay
that this Act is a direct Breach of the <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and a moſt Open Invaſion of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
Granted to the Diſſenters by the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration;
But we muſt profeſs our ſelves
utterly Ignorant of any Diſcovery to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Underſtanding, as to any Clauſe, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Thing in it, whereby the ſaid To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
is at all Confirm'd as aboveſaid;
which Ignorance, we hope, may be Humbly
acknowledg'd, without Offence.</p>
            <p>We conclude this with One Only View,
being the laſt Reſort the Diſſenters have, and
the Alone Help, which Humane Power can
offer to interpoſe in this Affair, and <hi>This is
in Her Majeſties Royal Goodneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And
the Authors of this ſmall Tract, beg
leave, in the Humbleſt manner, with all
poſſible Reſpect, with the utmoſt ſence of
Duty, in the Name of Her Majeſties Loyal,
but Diſtreſſed, Proteſtant Subjects, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters;
to whom Her Majeſty has ſo often
promis'd Her Protection; and in whoſe Zeal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0421902000:47"/>
for Her Service, Her Majeſty has been Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
pleas'd to expreſs great Satisfaction;
To repreſent,</p>
            <p>That Her Majeſty has given Her Royal
and Sacred Promiſe to Them on ſeveral
Occaſions, to Preſerve their Toleration
<hi rend="blackletterType">Inviolable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Submitting the reſt to Her Majeſty's
Conſideration.</p>
