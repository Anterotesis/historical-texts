            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. POPE.</head>
               <p>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of yours of the 8th inſtant; and
will make you a true excuſe, (tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
no very good one) that I defer'd the
troubling you with a letter, when I ſent
back your Papers, in hopes of ſeeing you
at <hi>Binfield</hi> before this time. If I had met
with any fault in your performance, I
ſhould freely now (as I have done too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly
in converſation with you) tell
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0093401002:4"/>
you my opinion; which I have frequently
ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance
with your deſires than that I could think it
reaſonable. For I am not yet ſatisfied upon
what grounds I can pretend to judge of
Poetry, who never have been practic'd in
the Art. There may poſſible be ſome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
genius's, who may judge of ſome of
the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man
may of the proportions of a building,
without having read <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> or knowing
any thing of the rules of architecture: But
this, tho' it may ſometimes be in the right,
muſt be ſubject to many miſtakes, and is
certainly but a ſuperficial knowledge;
without entring into the art, the methods,
and the particular excellencies of the whole
compoſure, in all the parts of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides my want of skill I have another
reaſon why I ought to ſuſpect my ſelf, by
reaſon of the great affection I have for
you, which might give too much biaſs, to
be kind to every thing that comes from
you; but after all, I muſt ſay (and I do it
with an old-faſhion'd ſincerity) that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
approve of your Tranſlation of thoſe
Pieces of <hi>Homer,</hi> both as to the verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the true ſenſe that ſhines thro' the
whole; nay I am confirm'd in my former
application to you, and give me leave to
renew it upon this occaſion, that you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0093401002:5"/>
wou'd proceed in tranſlating that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Poet, to make him ſpeak good <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
to dreſs his admirable characters in
your proper, ſignificant, and expreſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and to make his works as uſeful
and inſtructive to this degenerate age, as
he was to our friend <hi>Horace,</hi> when he
read him at <hi>Proeneſte, Qui, quid ſit pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum,
quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</hi> &amp;c.
I break off with that <hi>quid non?</hi> with which
I confeſs I am charm'd.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to
ſend this preſently to be added to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanies,
and I hope it will come time
enough for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to ſay of my Nephew
B.'s obſervations, for he ſent them to me
ſo late, that I had not time to conſider
them; I dare ſay he endeavour'd very
faithfully (tho' he told me very haſtily) to
execute your commands.</p>
               <p>All I can add is, that if your exceſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
ſhou'd hinder you from publiſhing this
<hi>Eſſay,</hi> I ſhall only be ſorry that I have no
more credit with you, to perſuade you to

               <p>I Send you <hi>Dennis</hi>'s remarks on the<note n="*" place="bottom">On Criticiſm.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi>
which equally abound in juſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms
and fine Railleries: The few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
in my hand in the margins, are
what a mornings leiſure permitted me
to make, purely for your peruſal. For I
am of opinion that ſuch a Critic as you
will find him by the latter part of his
book, is but one way to be properly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
and that way I wou'd not take
after what he informs me in his preface,
that he is at this time perſecuted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
This I knew not before; if I had,
his name had been ſpar'd in the Eſſay,
for that only reaſon. I can't conceive
what ground he has for ſo exceſſive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment;
nor imagine how thoſe <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>
                        <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> reddens at each word you ſpeak,</l> 
                        <l>And ſtares tremendous with a threatning eye,</l> 
                        <l>Like ſome fierce Tyrant in old Tapeſtry.</l>
                     </q>
                  </note> three
lines can be call'd a reflection on his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
which only deſcribe him ſubject a little
to Anger on ſome occaſions. I have heard
of combatants ſo very furious, as to fall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0093401002:7"/>
down themſelves with that very blow which
they deſign'd to lay heavy on their anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts.
But if Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s rage proceeds
only from a zeal to diſcourage young and
unexperienc'd writers from ſcribling, he
ſhou'd frighten us with his Verſe not Proſe:
for I have often known, that when all
the precepts in the world would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
a ſinner, ſome very ſad example has
done the buſineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">This Thought we find afterwards put into Verſe in the <hi>Dunciad, Book</hi> 1.</note>. Yet to give this man
his due, he has objected to one or two
lines with reaſon, and I will alter 'em in
caſe of another edition; I will make my
enemy do me a kindneſs where he meant
an injury, and ſo ſerve inſtead of a friend.
What he obſerves at the bottom of page
20th of his reflections, was objected to by
your ſelf, and had been mended but for
the haſte of the preſs: 'Tis right <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
and I confeſs it what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call
a <hi>Bull</hi> in the expreſſion, tho' the ſenſe be
manifeſt enough: Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Bulls are
ſeldom in the expreſſion, they are always
in the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall certainly never make the leaſt
reply to him, not only becauſe you adviſe
me, but becauſe I have ever been of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that if a book can't anſwer for itſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0093401002:8"/>
to the publick, 'tis to no ſort of purpoſe
for its author to do it. If I am wrong in
any ſentiment of that Eſſay, I proteſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
I don't deſire all the world ſhould
be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill
conſequence) meerly that I my ſelf may be
thought right, (which is of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence).
I'd be the firſt to recant, for
the benefit of others, and the glory of my
ſelf; for (as I take it) when a man owns
himſelf to have been in an error, he does
but tell you in other words, that he is wiſer
than he was. But I have had an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by the publiſhing that book of <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>'s
which otherwiſe I ſhould never have
known: It has been the occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
me friends, and open abetters, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
gentlemen of known ſenſe and wit;
and of proving to me what I have till
now doubted, that my writings are taken
ſome notice of by the world in general,
or I ſhould never be attack'd thus in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
I have read that 'twas a cuſtom
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> while a General rode
in triumph, to have common ſoldiers in
the ſtreets that rail'd at him and reproach'd
him; to put him in mind, that tho' his
ſervices were in the main approved and
rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep
him humble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0093401002:9"/>
You will ſee by this, that whoever ſets
up for wit in theſe days ought to have the
conſtancy of a primitive chriſtian, and be
prepar'd to ſuffer martyrdom in the cauſe
of it. But ſure this is the firſt time that
a Wit was attack'd for his <hi>Religion,</hi> as you'll
find I am moſt zealouſly in this treatiſe:
and you know Sir, what alarms I have had
from the <note n="*" place="bottom">See the enſuing Letters.</note> oppoſite ſide on this account.

thought, and ſhewn himſelf one (as he
very well expreſſes it) rather of a <hi>Number</hi>

us in relation to the Monks, is, that he
thinks moſt ſorts of learning flouriſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
'em, and I am of opinion that only
ſome ſort of learning was barely kept alive
by 'em: he believes, that in the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

of Learning in general; and I fancy
'twill be underſtood only (as 'tis meant) of
polite Learning, Criticiſm, Poetry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
is the only learning concern'd in the ſubject
of the Eſſay. It is true, that the <hi>Monks</hi>
did preſerve what learning there was about
<hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth's time; but thoſe who
ſucceeded fell into the depth of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,
or at leaſt ſtood at a ſtay while others
roſe from thence, inſomuch that even <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

error. And his teſtifying ſome eſteem for

rais'd a clamour againſt it, is an inſtance
of great generoſity and candor, which I

               <p>IN your laſt you informed me of the
miſtaken zeal of ſome people, who
ſeem to make no leſs their buſineſs to
perſuade men they are erroneous, than Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
do that they are ſick; only that they
may magnify their own cure, and triumph
over an imaginary diſtemper. The Simile
objected to in my Eſſay.<q>
                     <l>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</l>
                     <l>To one ſmall Sect, and all are damn'd beſide.)</l>
                  </q> Plainly concludes at this ſecond line, where
ſtands a full ſtop: and what follows <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they ſeek,</hi> &amp;c.) ſpeaks only of <hi>Wit,</hi>
(which is meant by <hi>that bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>that
ſun</hi>) for how can the ſun of <hi>faith</hi> be ſaid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0093401002:12"/>
to <hi>ſublime the ſouthern wits,</hi> and to <hi>ripen the
genius's of the northern climates?</hi> I fear theſe
gentlemen underſtand grammer as little as
they do criticiſim; and perhaps out of good
nature to the Monks, are willing to take
from 'em the cenſure of ignorance, and to
have it to themſelves. The word <hi>They</hi>
refers (as I am ſure I meant, and as I
thought every one muſt have known) to
thoſe critics there ſpoken of, who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to ſome perticular ſett of writers, to
the prejudice of all others. And the very
ſimile it ſelf, if twice read, may convince
them, that the cenſure here of damning
lies not on our Church at all, unleſs they
call our Church <hi>one ſmall Sect</hi> and the
cautious words, (<hi>by each man</hi>) manifeſtly
ſhow it a general reflection on all ſuch
(whoever they are) who entertain thoſe
narrow rnd limited notions of the mercy
of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and Presbyterians are as guilty of as
any people living.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, I promiſe you Sir, if the
alteration of a word or two will gratify any
man of ſound faith tho' weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I will (tho' it were from no other
principal than that of common good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
comply with it. And if you pleaſe
but to particularize the ſpot where their
objection lies, (for it is in a very narrow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0093401002:13"/>
compaſs) that ſtumbling-block, tho' it be
but a little pebble, ſhall be removed out
of their way. If the heat of theſe good
diſputants (who I am afraid being bred up
to wrangle in the ſchools, cannot get rid
of the humor all their lives) ſhou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ſo far as to perſonal reflections upon
me, I aſſure you notwithſtanding I will
do, or ſay nothing, however provok'd (for
ſome people can no more provoke than
oblige) that is unbecoming the character
of a true Catholick. I will ſet before me
the example of that great man, and great
Saint <hi>Eraſmus</hi>; who in the midſt of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
proceeded with all the calmneſs of
innocence, and the unrevenging ſpirit of
primitive chriſtianity. However I wou'd
adviſe them to ſuffer the mention of <hi>him</hi>
to paſs unregarded, leſt I ſhou'd be forc'd
to do that for his reputation which I
wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to
vindicate ſo great a light of our Church
from the malice of paſt times, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the preſent, in a language which
the Trifle about Criticiſm is writen. I wiſh
theſe gentlemen wou'd be contented with
finding fault with me only, who will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
am concern'd; I have a greater regard
to the quiet of mankind than to diſturb it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0093401002:14"/>
for things of ſo little conſequence as my
credit and my ſenſe. A little humility can
do a Poet no hurt, and a little Charity
wou'd do a Prieſt none: For as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>

Humilitas, ibi Pax.</hi>

               <p>THE concern which you more than
ſeem to be affected with for my
reputation, by the ſeveral accounts you have
ſo obligingly given of what reports and
cenſures the holy Vandals have thought fit
to paſs upon me, makes me deſirous of
telling ſo good a friend my whole thoughts
of this matter; and of ſetting before you
in a clear light the true ſtate of it.</p>
               <p>I have ever believ'd the beſt piece of
ſervice one cou'd do to our religion, was
openly to expreſs our deteſtation and ſcorn
of all thoſe mean artifices and <hi>Pioe fraudes,</hi>
which it ſtands ſo little in need of, and
which have laid it under ſo great a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0093401002:15"/>
Nothing has been ſo much a ſcarecrow
to them, as that too peremptory and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly-uncharitable
aſſertion of an utter <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi>
of <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but ourſelves;
<hi>invincible</hi> ignorance excepted, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome people define under ſo great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
and with ſuch excluſions, that
it ſeems as if that word were rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
as a ſalvo, or expedient, not to be
thought too bold with the thunder-bolts
of God (which are hurl'd about ſo freely
on almoſt all mankind by the hands of
eccleſiaſticks) than as a real exception to
almoſt-univerſal damnation. For beſides
the ſmall number of the truly faithful in
our Church, we muſt again ſubdivide;
the <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> is damn'd by the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> the
<hi>Jeſuit</hi> by the <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſt</hi> by the
<hi>Thomiſt,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>There may be Errors I grant, but I can't
think'em of ſuch conſequenceas to deſtroy
utterly the charity of mankind; the very
greateſt bond in which we are ingag'd by
God to one another. Therefore I own to
you, I was glad of any opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
my diſlike of ſo ſhocking a ſentiment
as thoſe of the religion I profeſs are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
charg'd with; and I hop'd, a ſlight
inſinuation, introduc'd ſo eaſily by a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
ſimilitude only, cou'd never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
offence; but on the contrary muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0093401002:16"/>
needs have done good; in a nation and
time, wherein we are the ſmaller party
and conſequently moſt miſrepreſented, and
moſt in need of vindication.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon, I took occaſion to
mention the <hi>Superſtition</hi> of ſome ages after
the ſubverſion of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which
is too manifeſt a truth to be deny'd, and
does in no ſort reflect upon the preſent
profeſſors of our faith who are free from
it. Our ſilence in theſe points may with
ſome reaſon make our adverſaries think we
allow and perſiſt in thoſe biggotries; which
yet in reality all good and ſenſible Men
deſpiſe, tho' they are perſuaded not to
ſpeak againſt 'em; I can't tell why, ſince
now, 'tis no way the intereſt even of the
worſt of our Prieſthood (as it might have
been then) to have them ſmother'd in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
For as the oppoſite Sects are now
prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our Church
from being ſlander'd; 'tis our buſineſs now
to ſhow it is ſlander'd unjuſtly, and to
vindicate our ſelves from being thought
abettors of what they charge us with.
This can't ſo well be brought about with
ſerious faces; we muſt laugh with them
at what deſerves it; and then we need not
doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0093401002:17"/>
As to particulars; you cannot but have
obſerv'd that at firſt the whole objection
againſt the ſimile of wit and faith lay to
the word <hi>They</hi>: When that was beyond
contradiction removed (the very Grammar
ſerving to confute 'em) then the objection
lies againſt the <hi>Simile itſelf</hi>; or if that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile
will not be objected to (ſenſe and
common reaſon being indeed a little ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and not apt to give way to every
body) next the mention of <hi>Superſtition</hi>
muſt become a crime (as if <hi>Religion</hi> and
ſhe were ſiſters, or that ſcandal upon the
family of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſay a word againſt
the Devil's baſtard.) Afterwards, more
miſchief is diſcover'd in a place that ſeem'd
innocent at firſt, the two lines about <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,</hi>
at the bottom of page 24. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
man wou'd imagine the author
plainly declar'd againſt thoſe ſchiſmatics,
for quitting the true faith out of contempt
of the underſtanding of ſome few of its
believers: But theſe believers are call'd
<hi>Dull,</hi> and becauſe that I ſay <hi>thoſe ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics</hi>
think <hi>ſome</hi> believers <hi>dull,</hi> therefore
theſe charitable interpreters of my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will have it, that <hi>I</hi> think <hi>all</hi> believers
dull. I was telling lately Mr. <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> theſe
objections: who aſſur'd me I had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which a Catholick need to diſown,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0093401002:18"/>
and I have cauſe to know that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
fault (if he has any) is not want of
zeal: He put a notion into my head which
I confeſs I can't but perfectly acquieſce
in; that when a ſett of people are piqu'd
at any truth which they think to their
own diſadvantage, their method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
on the truth-ſpeaker is to attack
his reputation a By-way, and not openly
to object to the place they are really gall'd
by: What theſe therefore (in his opinion)
are in earneſt angry at, is, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi>
whom their tribe oppreſs'd and perſecuted
ſhou'd be vindicated after an age of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy
by one of their own people, willing
to utter an honeſt truth in behalf of the
dead, whom no man ſure will flatter,
and to whom few will do juſtice. Others,
you know were as angry that I mention'd
Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> with honour who as he never
refus'd to any one of merit of any party
the praiſe due to him, ſo honeſtly deſerv'd
it from all others, tho' of ever ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
intereſts or ſentiments. May I be
ever guilty of this ſort of liberty, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of principle! which gives us the
hardineſs of ſpeaking well of thoſe whom
envy oppreſſes ev'n after death. As I
wou'd always ſpeak well of my living
friends when they are abſent, nay becauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0093401002:19"/>
they are abſent; ſo would I much more
of the dead, in that eternal abſence; and
the rather becauſe I expect no thanks
forit.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee I do in my Conſcience
perſiſt in what I have written; yet in my
friendſhip I will recant and alter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

differ in their addreſs from flatterers, much
as right maſtiffs do from ſpaniels, and
ſhow themſelves by a dumb ſurly ſort of
fidelity, rather than by their complaiſant

               <p>I AM at a ſolitude, an houſe between

                  </q> This was an happy talent to a man of the

to make uncharitable conjectures on the

pray'd,

pious, but not with ſo exalted and poetical
a ſpirit as the prophet. <hi>The Lord God will
wipe away tears from off all faces.</hi> If you

comes into a volume it may be amended.

               <p>YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind
letter, by which I find you ſhift the
ſcene of your life from the town to the
country, and enjoy that mix'd ſtate which
wiſe men both delight in, and are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
for. Methinks the Moraliſts and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
have generally run too much into
extreams in commending intirely either
ſolitude, or publick life. In the former,
men for the moſt part grow uſeleſs by too
much reſt, and in the latter are deſtroy'd
by too much precipitation; as waters lying
ſtill, putrify and are good for nothing, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0093401002:28"/>
running violently on do but the more
miſchief in their paſſage to others, and
are ſwallow'd up and loſt the ſooner

uſeful to all ſtates, ſhould be like gentle
ſtreams, that not only glide thro' lonely
valleys and foreſts amidſt the flocks and
the ſhepherds, but viſit populous towns in
their courſe and are at once of ornament
and ſervice to them. But there are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ſort of people who ſeem deſign'd for
ſolitude, ſuch I mean as have more to hide
than to ſhow: As for my own part, I am
one of thoſe of whom <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Tam
umbratiles ſunt, ut putent in turbido eſſe quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid

are fitter for a corner than a full
light; and I believe ſuch as have a natural
bent to ſolitude (to carry on the former
ſimilitude) are like waters which may be
forc'd into fountains and exalted into a
great height, and make a noble figure
and a louder noiſe, but after all they would
run more ſmoothly, quietly and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in their own natural courſe upon the
ground. The conſideration of this would

               <p>YOU formerly obſerv'd to me, that
nothing made a more ridiculous figure
in a man's life, than the diſparity we often
find in him ſick and well: Thus one of
an unfortunate conſtitution is perpetually
exhibiting a miſerable example of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his mind, and of his body, in their
turns. I have had frequent opportunities
of late to conſider my ſelf in theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
views, and I hope have receiv'd ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0093401002:30"/>
advantage by it, if what Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> ſays
be ture, that
<q>
                     <l>The ſoul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</l>
                     <l>Lets in new light thro' chincks that time has
made.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſurely ſickneſs, contributing no leſs
than old age to the ſhaking down this
ſcaffolding of the body, may diſcover the
inward ſtructure more plainly. Sickneſs
is a ſort of early old age; it teaches us a
diffidence in our earthly ſtate and inſpires
us with the thoughts of a future, better
than a thouſand volumes of philoſiphers
and divines. It gives ſo warning a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
to thoſe props of our vanity, our
ſtrength and youth, that we think of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
our our ſelves within, when there is ſo
little dependance upon our out-works.
Youth at the very beſt is but a betrayer
of human life in a gentler and ſmoother
manner than age: 'Tis like a ſtream that
nouriſhes a plant upon a bank, and cauſes
it to flouriſh and bloſſom to the ſight, but
at the ſame time is undermining it at the
root in ſecret. My youth has dealt more
fairly and openly with me, it has afforded
ſeveral Proſpects of my danger, and given
me an advantage not very common to
young men, that the attractions of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0093401002:31"/>
world have not dazzle me very much;
and I begin where moſt people end, with
a full conviction of the emptineſs of all
ſorts of ambition, and the unſatisfactory
nature of all human pleaſure. When a
ſmart fit of ſickneſs tells me this ſcurvy
tenement of my body will fall in a little
time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that
honeſt <hi>Hiberniam,</hi> who being in bed in the
great ſtorm ſome years ago, and told the
houſe would tumble over his head, made
anſwer, What care I for the houſe? I
am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the beſt
time todie when one is in the beſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and ſo exceſſively weak as I now
am I may ſay with conſcience, that I am
not at all uneaſy at the thought that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men whome I never had any eſteem
for, are likely to enjoy this world after me.
When I reflect what an inconſiderable little
attom every ſingle man is, with reſpect to
the whole creation, methinks 'tis a ſhame
to be concern'd at the removal of ſuch a
trivial animal as I am. The morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Exit, the ſun will riſe as bright as
ever, the flowers ſmell as ſweet, the plants
ſpring as green, the world will proceed in
its old courſe, people will laugh as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and marry as faſt as they were us'd to
do. The memory of man, (as it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
expreſs'd in the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi>)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0093401002:32"/>
paſſeth away as the Remembrance of a gueſt
that tarrieth but one day. There are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
enough, in the fourth chapter of the
ſame book, to make any young man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the proſpect of death. <hi>For ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
age is not that which ſtandeth in
length of time, or is meaſur'd by number of
years. But wiſdom is the gray hair to men,
and an unſpotted life is old age. He was

               <p>I Was the other day in company with
five of ſix men of ſome learning; where
chancing to mention the famous verſes which
the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> ſpoke on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
they were all agreed that 't was a
piece of Gaiety unworthy of that Prince
in thoſe circumſtances. I could not but
differ from this opinion: Methinks it was
by no means a gay, but a very ſerious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy
to his ſoul at the point of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture;
in which ſenſe I naturally took
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0093401002:33"/>
the verſes at my firſt reading them when I
was very young, and before I knew what
interpretation the world generally put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.<q>

the future fate of his ſoul will ſeem
ſo far from being the effect of want of
thought, that 'twas ſcarce reaſonable he
ſhould think otherwiſe; not to mention
that here is a plain confeſſion included of
his belief in its immortality. The dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive

               <p>YOU have at length comply'd with
the requeſt I have often made you,
for you have ſhown me, I muſt confeſs,
ſeveral of my faults in the ſight of thoſe
letters. Upon a review of them, I find
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0093401002:39"/>
many things that would give me ſhame,
if I were not more deſirous to be thought
honeſt than prudent: ſo many things freely
thrown out, ſuch lengths of unreſerv'd
friendſhip, thoughts juſt warm from the
brain, without any poliſhing or dreſs, the
very diſhabille of the underſtanding. You
have prov'd your ſelf more tender of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's
embroyo's than the fondeſt mothers
are of their own, for you have preſerv'd
every thing that I miſcarry'd of. Since I
know this, I ſhall in one reſpect be more
afraid of writing to you than ever, at this
careleſs rate, becauſe I ſee my evil works
may again riſe in judgment againſt me:
Yet in another reſpect I ſhall be leſs afraid,
ſince this has given me ſuch a proof of
the extreme indulgence you afford to my
ſlighteſt thoughts. The reviſal of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
has been a kind of examination of
conſcience to me; ſo fairly and faithfully
have I ſet down in 'em from time to time
the true and undiſtinguiſh'd ſtate of my
mind. But I find that theſe, which were
intended as sketches of my friendſhip, give
as imperfect images of it, as the little
landſcapes we commonly ſee in black
and white, do of a beautiful country;
they can repreſent but a very ſmall part
of it, and that depriv'd of the life and luſtre
of nature. I perceive that the more I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0093401002:40"/>
to render manifeſt the real affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and value I ever had for you, I did
but injure it by repreſenting leſs and leſs
of it: as glaſſes which are deſign'd to make
an object very clear, generally contract
it. Yet as when people have a full
idea of a thing, firſt, upon their own
knowledge, the leaſt traces of it ſerve to
refreſh the Remembrance, and are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
on that ſcore: So I hope the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
you had of my eſteem for you,
is the reaſon that you do not diſlike my
letters.</p>
               <p>They will not be of any great ſervice
(I find) in the deſign I mentioned to you:
I believe I had better ſteal from a richer
man, and plunder your letters, (which I
have kept as carefully as I would Letters
Patents, ſince they intitle me to what I
more value than titles of honour.) You
have ſome cauſe to apprehend this uſage
from me, if what ſome ſay be true, that
I am a great Borrower; however I have
hitherto had the luck that none of my
creditors have challeng'd me for it: and
thoſe who ſay it are ſuch, whoſe writings
no man ever borrow'd from, ſo have the
leaſt reaſon to complain: Their works are
granted on all hands to be but too much
their own.—Another has been pleas'd
to declare, that my Verſes are corrected by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0093401002:41"/>
other men: I verily believe theirs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
corrected by any man: But indeed if
mine have not, 'twas not my fault, I have
endeavour'd my utmoſt that they ſhould.
But theſe things only whiſper'd, and I

what flows from the heart, than a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
after <hi>Balzac</hi>'s manner in ſtudied phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
therefore I will tell you as faſt as I can,
that I have receiv'd your favour of the

<hi>The Rape of the Lock.</hi> You have given
me the trueſt ſatisfaction imaginable, not
only in making good the juſt opinion I have
ever had of your reach of thought, and
my Idea of your comprehenſive genius; but
likewiſe in that pleaſure I take as an <hi>Engliſh</hi>

touches, that your own obſervation and

the fineſt ſtrokes, and the livelieſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
But I muſt ſay no more (tho'
I could a great deal) on what pleaſes me
ſo much: and henceforth I hope you will
never condemn me of partiality, ſince I
only ſwim with the ſtream, and approve
what all men of good taſte (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the jarring of Parties) muſt and
do univerſally applaud. I now come to
what is of vaſt moment, I mean the
preſervation of your health, and beg of you
earneſtly to get out of all Tavern-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and fly away <hi>tanquam ex incendio.</hi> What
a miſery it is for you to be deſtroy'd by the
fooliſh kindneſs ('tis all one whether real

the Poiſon of bad Wine, and to engage you
in ſo unequal a combat? As to <hi>Homer,</hi>
by all I can learn your buſineſs is done;

               <p>THough any thing you write is ſure
to be a pleaſure to me, yet I muſt
own your laſt letter made me uneaſy: You
really uſe a ſtyle of compliment, which I
expect as little as I deſerve it. I know 'tis
a common opinion that a young ſcribler
is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young
Lady. From the moment one ſets up for
an author, one muſt be treated as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly,
that is as unfaithfully,
<q>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which firſt makes a man an author,
is certainly enough to render him a cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
for life. But I muſt grant it is but
a juſt judgement upon Poets, that they whoſe
chief pretence is Wit, ſhou'd be treated juſt
as they themſelves treat Fools, that is, be
cajoll'd with praiſes. And I believe, Poets
are the only poor fellows in the world
whom any body will flatter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0093401002:44"/>
I would not be thought to ſay this as if
the obliging letter you ſent me deſerv'd this
imputation, only it put me in mind of it;
and I fancy one may apply to one's friend
when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid of his Wife; <hi>It was not
ſufficient that he knew her to be chaſte himſelf,
but ſhe ſhou'd not be ſo much as ſuſpected by
others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the wonderful diſcoveries, and
all the good news you are pleas'd to
tell me of my ſelf; I treat it as you who
are in the Secret treat common news,
groundleſs reports of things at a diſtance
which I who look into the true ſprings of the
affair at home, in my own breaſt, know to
have no foundation at all. For <hi>Fame</hi> tho' it
be as <hi>Milton</hi> finely calls it, <hi>The laſt Infirmity
of noble Minds,</hi> is ſcarce ſo ſtrong a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as to warrant our loſs of time here:
It can never make up lie down contentedly
on a death-bed (as ſome of the ancients
are ſaid to have done with that thought).
You Sir have your ſelf taught me, that an
eaſy ſituation at that hour, can proceed
from no ambition leſs noble than that of
an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by
the ſtrongeſt endeavours of the Wit, but
may be gain'd by the ſincere intentions of
the Heart only. As in the next world,
ſo in this, the only ſolid bleſſings are owing
to the goodneſs of the mind, not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0093401002:45"/>
of the capacity: Friendſhip here is an
emanation from the ſame ſource as Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
there: the ſame benevolence and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diſpoſition that qualifies us for the one,
if extended farther, makes us partakers of
the other. The utmoſt point of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
in my preſent ſtate terminates in the
ſociety and good-will of worthy men, which
I look upon as no ill earneſt and fore-taſte
of the ſociety and alliance of happy ſouls
hereafter.</p>
               <p>The continuance of your favours to me
is what not only makes me happy, but
cauſes me to ſet ſome value upon my ſelf
as a part of your care. The inſtances I

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0093401002:46"/>
obliged to Mr. <hi>Jervas,</hi> who gives me
daily inſtructions and examples. As to poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
affairs, I am content at preſent to be a
bare looker-on, and from a practitioner turn
an admirer, which is (as the world goes)
not very uſual. <hi>Cato</hi> was not ſo much the
wonder of <hi>Rome</hi> in his days, as he is of
<hi>Britain</hi> in ours; and tho' all the fooliſh
induſtry poſſible has been uſed to make
it thought a Party-play, yet what the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

properly in the world be apply'd to him
on this occaſion.<q>
                     <l>Envy itſelf is dumb, in wonder loſt,</l>

               </p>
               <p>The numerous and violent claps of the
Whig-party on the one-ſide of the theatre,
were eccho'd back by the Tories on the
other; while the Author ſweated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the ſcenes with concern, to find
their applauſe proceeding more from the
hand than the head. This was the caſe
too of the Prologue-writer, who was
clapp'd into a ſtanch Whig, at almoſt
ev'ry too lines. I believe you have
heard, that after all the applauſes of the
oppoſite Faction, my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> ſent
for <hi>Booth</hi> who play'd <hi>Cato,</hi> into the box,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0093401002:47"/>
between one of the acts, and preſented him
with fifty guinea's; in acknowledgment
(as he expreſt it) for defending the cauſe
of <hi>Liberty</hi> ſo well againſt a <hi>Perpetual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator.</hi>
The Whigs are unwilling to be
diſtanc'd this way, (as 'tis ſaid) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

ſpeedily; in the mean time they are get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ready as good a Sentence as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

to tell you the bottom of my heart, I
am no way diſpleas'd that I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the violent of all Parties already; and
at the ſame time I aſſure you conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly,
I feel not the leaſt malevolence
or reſentment againſt any of thoſe who
miſrepreſent me, or are diſſatisfied with
me. This frame of mind is ſo eaſy, that
I am perfectly content with my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>

As I hope and would flatter my ſelf,
that you know me and my thoughts ſo
entirely as never to be miſtaken in either,
ſo 'tis a pleaſure to me that you gueſs'd ſo
right in regard to the Author of that
<hi>Guardian</hi> you mention'd. But I am ſorry
to find it has taken air that I have ſome
hand in thoſe Papers, becauſe I write ſo
very few as neither to deſerve the credit of
ſuch a report with ſome people, nor the
diſrepute of it with others. An honeſt
<hi>Jacobite</hi> ſpoke to me the ſenſe or non-ſenſe
of the weak part of his Party ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fairly, that the good people took it
ill of me, that I writ with <hi>Steele,</hi> tho'
upon never ſo indifferent ſubjects—This I know you will laugh at as well as I
do: yet I doubt not but many little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators
and perſons of ſower diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
will take occaſion hence to beſpatter
me. I confeſs I ſcorn narrow ſouls, of all
parties, and if I renounce my reaſon in
religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any
other.</p>
               <p>I can't imagine whence it comes to paſs
that the few <hi>Guardians</hi> I have written are
ſo generally known for mine: that in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
which you mention I never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to any man but the publiſher, till ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lately: yet almoſt every body I met told
me of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0093401002:54"/>
The true reaſon that Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> laid down
the Paper, was a quarrel between him and
<hi>Jacob Tonſon.</hi> He ſtood ingag'd to his
bookſeller, in articles of Penalty, for all
the <hi>Guardians:</hi> and by deſiſting two days
and altering the title of the paper to that
of the <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> was quit of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
theſe papers being printed by <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I
cannot any way enter into that ſecret, nor
have I been let into it, any more than into
the reſt of his politicks. Tho' 'tis ſaid, he
will take into theſe papers alſo ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the politer kind, as before: But I
aſſure you as to my ſelf, I have quite done
with 'em, for the future. The little I
have done, and the great reſpect I bear
Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> as a Man of Wit, has render'd
me a ſuſpected Whig to ſome of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
but (as old <hi>Dryden</hi> ſaid before me)
'Tis not the Violent I deſign to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I generally employ the mornings in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Mr. <hi>Jervas</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Epiſtle to him in Verſe, writ about this time.</note>; and the evenings in

that is honeſt Principles, with equal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.
The beſt way I know of overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Calumny and Miſconſtruction, is by
a vigorous perſeverance in every thing we
know to be right, and a total neglect of
all that can enſue from it. 'Tis partly
from this maxim that I depend upon your
friendſhip, becauſe I believe it will do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to my intention in every thing; and
give me leave to tell you, that (as the world

               <p>I Have been lying in wait for my own
imagination, this week and more, and
watching what thoughts came up in
the whirl of the fancy, that were worth
communicating to you in a letter. But I
am at length convinc'd that my rambling
head can produce nothing of that ſort; ſo
I muſt e'en be contented with telling you
the old ſtory, that I love you heartily. I
have often found by experience, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0093401002:56"/>
and truth, tho' never ſo low or vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
are yet pleaſing when openly and

to me, to read the very letters of
an infant, could it write its innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies
and tautologies juſt as it
thought 'em. This makes me hope a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from me will not be unwelcome to
you, when I am conſcious I write with
more unreſervedneſs than ever man wrote,
or perhaps talk'd to another. I truſt your
good nature with the whole range of my
follies, and really love you ſo well, that I
would rather you ſhould pardon me than
eſteem me, ſince one is an act of goodneſs
and benevolence, the other a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
deference.</p>
               <p>You can't wonder my thoughts are ſcarce
conſiſtent, when I tell you how they are
diſtracted. Ev'ry hour of my life, my
mind is ſtrangely divided; this minute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I am above the ſtars, with a thouſand

mighty Inconſiſtency! Sickneſs and Pain is

us, are yet as long-lived and poſſeſs as wide
a ſcene of action as a man, if we conſider
him with an eye to all Space, and all

when I ſnatch an hour to pleaſe my

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0093401002:59"/>
and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
proſpect to be reflecting, that ſo
long a ſiege as that of <hi>Troy</hi> lies upon my
hands, and the campagne above half over,
before I have made any progreſs, Indeed
the <hi>Greek</hi> fortification upon a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
does not appear ſo formidable as it
did, and I am almoſt apt to flatter my ſelf,
that <hi>Homer</hi> ſecretly ſeems inclin'd to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with me, in letting me into
a good part of his intentions. There are
indeed, a ſort of underling auxiliars to the
difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators
and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by their number and bulk, and perplex
our progreſs under pretence of fortifying
their author. Theſe lie very low in the
trenches and ditches they themſelves have
digg'd, encompaſs'd with dirt of their own
heaping up, but I think there may be
found a method of coming at the main
works by a more ſpeedy and gallant way
than by mining under ground, that is, by
uſing the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over their heads.</p>
               <p>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find
you are concern'd how I ſhall be paid, and
are ſollicitous that I may not have the ill
fate of many diſcarded Generals, to be firſt
envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd,
and laſtly neglected. The former (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0093401002:60"/>
attendant upon all great and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
enterprizes) I have already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd.
Some have ſaid I am not a Maſter
in the <hi>Greek,</hi> who either are ſo themſelves
or are not: If they are not, they can't
tell; and if they are, they can't without
having catechiz'd me. But if they can
read (for I know ſome Critics can, and
others cannot) there are fairly lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them ſome ſpecimens of my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
from this Author in the <hi>Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanics,</hi>
which they are heartily welcome
to. I have met with as much malignity
another way, ſome calling me a Tory,
becauſe the heads of that party have been
diſtinguiſhingly favourable to me; ſome
a Whig becauſe I have been favour'd with
yours, Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> his
friendſhip, and of late with my Lord <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax</hi>'s
Patronage. How much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
a concluſion might be form'd, by any
good-natur'd man, that a perſon who has
been well us'd by all ſides, has been offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to none. This miſerable age is ſo ſunk
between animoſities of Party and thoſe of
Religion, that I begin to fear, moſt men
have politicks enough to make (thro' vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence)
the beſt Scheme of Government a
bad one; and faith enough to hinder their
own Salvation. I hope for my own part,
never to have more of either than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0093401002:61"/>
with common juſtice and charity, and
always as much as becomes a chriſtian and

thing to be bred a <hi>Papiſt</hi> here, where one
is obnoxious to four parts in five as being
ſo too much, and to the fifth part as being

himſelf with much indignation againſt
me one evening at <hi>Button</hi>'s Coffee-houſe (as
I was told) ſaying, That I was enter'd into
a Cabal with Dean <hi>Swift</hi> and others to
write againſt the <hi>Whig-Intereſt,</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to undermine his own reputation,
and that of his friends <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Addiſon.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> never open'd his lips to
my face, on this or any like occaſion,
tho' I was almoſt every night in the ſame
room with him, nor ever offer'd me any
indecorum. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> came to me a
night or two after <hi>Philips</hi> had talk'd in

of what had been ſaid, of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
we ſhould always maintain, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd

My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> did me the honour to
ſtir in this matter, by ſpeaking to ſeveral
people to obviate a fal&amp;ſe aſperſion, which
might have done me no ſmall prejudice

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0093401002:65"/>
he could, ſecretly to continue the report
with the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club, and kept in his

the whole matter; but as to the ſecret
grounds of <hi>Philips</hi>'s malignity, they will
make a very pleaſant Hiſtory when we
meet. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> and ſome others have
been much diverted with it, and moſt of

               <p>YOU mention the account I gave you
ſome time ago of the things which
<hi>Philips</hi> ſaid in his fooliſhneſs; but I can't
tell from any thing in your Letter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you receiv'd a long one from me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a fortnight ſince. It was principally
intended to thank you for the laſt obliging
favour you did me; and perhaps for that
reaſon you paſs it in ſilence. I there
launch'd into ſome account of my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
affairs, and intend now to give you
ſome hints of my ſpiritual. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of your Letter draws this upon you,
where you tell me, you <hi>pray'd</hi> for me:
Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that
of moſt other Friends, who never talk of
praying for a Man after they have done
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0093401002:67"/>
him a ſervice, but only when they will do
him none. Nothing can be more kind
than the hint you give me of the vanity
of human Sciences, which I aſſure you I
am daily more and more convinc'd of; and
indeed I have for ſome years paſt, look'd
upon all of 'em no better than amuſements.
To make them the ultimate end of our
purſuit, is a miſerable and ſhort ambition,
which will drop from us at ev'ry little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
here, and even in caſe of no
diſappointments here, will infallibly deſert
us hereafter. The utmoſt fame they are
capable of beſtowing, is never worth the
pains they coſt us, and the time they loſe
us. If you attain the top of your deſires
that way, all thoſe who envy you will do
you harm; and of thoſe who admire you,
few will do you good. The unſucceſsful
writers are your declared enemies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the ſucceſsful your ſecret ones: For
thoſe hate not more to be excell'd, than
theſe to be rivall'd. And at the upſhot,
after a life of perpetual application, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
that you have been doing nothing for
your ſelf, and that the ſame or leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
might have gain'd you a Friendſhip
that can never deceive or end, a ſatisfaction
which praise cannot beſtow, nor vanity feel,
and a glory which (tho' in one reſpect like
ſame, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0093401002:68"/>
ſhall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. Theſe,
dear Sir, are unfeignedly my ſentiments,
whenever I think at all; for half the things
that employ our heads deſerve not the name
of thoughts, they are only ſtronger dreams
or impreſſions upon the imagination: Our
ſchemes of government, our ſyſtems of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
our golden worlds of poetry, are all
but ſo many ſhadowy images, and airy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
which ariſe to us but ſo much the
livelier and more frequent, as we are more
o'ercaſt with the darkneſs, and diſturb'd
with the fumes of human vanity.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing that makes old men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leave this world, makes me willing
to leave poetry, long-habit, and wearineſs
of the ſame track. <hi>Homer</hi> will work a
cure upon me; fifteen thouſand verſes are
equivalent to fourſcore years, to make one
old in Rhime: And I ſhou'd be ſorry and
aſhamed, to go on jingling to the laſt ſtep,
like a waggoner's horſe, in the ſame road,
and ſo leave my <hi>Bells</hi> to the next ſilly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
that will be proud of 'em. That man
makes a mean figure in the eyes of reaſon,
who is meaſuring ſyllables and coupling
rhimes, when he ſhou'd be mending his own
Soul, and ſecuring his own immortality. If
I had not this opinion, I ſhou'd be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
even of thoſe ſmall and limited parts
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0093401002:69"/>

               <p>I Have no better excuſe to offer you, that

which is, in his blindneſs. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
afflicted with headach's, that very

coming hither I have ſcarce paſt an hour
agreeably, except that in which I read your

you have no man who more truly knows to
place a right value on your friendſhip, than
he who leaſt deſerves it on all other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
than his due ſenſe of it. But let
me tell you, you can hardly gueſs what a
task you undertake, when you profeſs your
ſelf my friend; there are ſome <hi>Tories</hi>

<hi>Heretick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find by dear experience, we live in an
age, where it is criminal to be moderate;
and where no one man can be allowed to be
juſt to all men. The notions of right and
wrong are ſo far ſtrain'd that perhaps to be
in the right ſo very violently, may be of
worſe conſequence than to be eaſily and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
in the wrong. I really wiſh all men ſo
well, that I am ſatisfied but few can wiſh
me ſo; but if thoſe few are ſuch as tell me
they do, I am content, for they are the beſt
people I know: While you believe me what
I profeſs as to Religion, I can bear any thing
the bigotted may ſay; while Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>
likes my poetry, I can endure <hi>Dennis</hi> and a
thouſand more like him; while the moſt
honeſt and moral of each party think me no
ill man, I can eaſily ſupport it, tho' the moſt
violent and mad of all parties roſe up to
throw dirt at me.</p>
               <p>I muſt expect an hundred attacks upon
the publication of my <hi>Homer.</hi> Whoever in
our times would be a profeſſor of learning
above his fellows, ought at the very firſt to
enter the world with the conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of a primitive Chriſtian, and be
prepared to ſuffer all ſort of publick Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0093401002:71"/>
It is certainly to be lamented, that
if any man does but endeavour to diſtinguiſh
himſelf, or gratify others by his ſtudies, he
is immediately treated as a common enemy,
inſtead of being look'd upon as a common
friend; and aſſaulted as generally, as if his
whole deſign were to prejudice the State,
and ruin the publick. I will venture to ſay,
no man ever roſe to any degree of prefection
in writing, but through obſtinacy and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
reſolution againſt the ſtream of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
So that if the world has receiv'd any
benefit from the labours of the Learned, it
was in its own deſpite. For when firſt they
eſſay their parts, all people in general are
prejudiced againſt new beginners; and when
they have got a little above contempt, then
ſome particular perſon who were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in their own attempts, are ſworn
foes to them only becauſe they ſucceed.—Upon the whole, one may ſay of the beſt
writers, that they pay a ſevere fine for their
fame, which it is always in the power of the
moſt worthleſs part of mankind to levy
upon them when they pleaſe.</p>

its cuſtoms and its manners, to be fully

ſee what paſſes under my noſe, and hear
nothing that is ſaid about me. To fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Poetry as one ought, one muſt forget
father and mother, and cleave to it alone.
My <hi>Rêverie</hi> has been ſo deep, that I have

in the want of your Company. I now

I fancy no friendſhip is ſo likely to prove
laſting as ours, becauſe I am pretty ſure
there never was a friendſhip of ſo eaſie a
nature. We neither of us demand any
mighty things from each other; what Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
we have expects its gratification from
other people. It is not I, that am to tell
you what an Artiſt you are, nor is it you
that are to tell me what a Poet I am;
but 'tis from the world abroad we hope,
(piouſly hope) to hear theſe things. At
home we follow our buſineſs, when we
have any; and think and talk moſt of each
other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike
the happy friendſhip of a ſtay'd man and
his wife, who are ſeldom ſo fond as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the buſineſs, of the houſe from going
on all day, or ſo indolent as not to find
conſolation in each other every evening.
Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity
to the laſt, by not expecting too much from
human nature; while romantick friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
like violent loves, begin with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets,
proceed to jealouſies, and conclude
in animoſities. I have liv'd to ſee the fierce
advancement, the ſudden turn, and the
abrupt period of three or four of theſe
enormous friendſhips, and am perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of the truth of a Maxim we once

agreement of people who live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0093401002:76"/>
but meer vanity; a ſecret inſiſting
upon what they think their dignity or

an Over-meaſure of deference and regard,
as anſwers to their own extravagant falſe
ſcale; and which no body can pay, becauſe
none but themſelves can tell, exactly, to

each other as little as I would either; and
that our own people may live as quietly as

diverted and entertain'd there—all
very honeſt fellows—much concern'd for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0093401002:82"/>
the Queen's death. No panegyricks ready

               <p>I admire your <hi>Whig-principles</hi> of Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
exceedingly, in the ſpirit of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celonians.</hi>
I joyn in your wiſh for them.
Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s verſes on Liberty, in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from <hi>Italy,</hi> would be a good form of
prayer in my opinion, <hi>O Liberty! thou
Goddeſs heavenly bright!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What you mention'd of the friendly
office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr.
<hi>Addiſon</hi> and me, deſerves acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on my part. You thoroughly know
my regard to his character, and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
to teſtify it by all ways in my
power. You as thoroughly know the
ſcandalous meanneſs of that proceeding
which was uſed by <hi>Philips.</hi> to make a man
I ſo highly value, ſuſpect my diſpoſitions
toward him. But as, after all, Mr. <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
muſt be the judge in what regards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and has ſeem'd to be no very juſt one
to me; ſo I muſt own to you I expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but civility from him, how much
ſoever I wiſh for his friendſhip: And as
for any offices of real kindneſs or ſervice
which it is in his power to do me, I ſhould
be aſham'd to receive 'em from any man
who had no better opinion of my morals,
than to think me a party-man; nor of my
temper, than to believe me capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligning
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0093401002:83"/>
or envying another's reputation as
a Poet. So I leave it to time to convince
him as to both, to ſhew him the ſhallow
depths of thoſe half-wited creatures who
miſ-inform'd him, and to prove that I am
incapable of endeavouring to leſſen a perſon
whom I would be proud to imitate, and
therefore aſham'd to flatter. In a word,
Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> is ſure of my reſpect at all

he ſhall think fit to know me for

               <p>For all that paſs'd betwixt Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> and

I had to him were ſuch as the actual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
he had done me, in relation to the
ſubſcription for <hi>Homer,</hi> obliged me to. I
muſt have leave to be grateful to him, and
to any one who ſerves me, let him be
never ſo obnoxious to any party: nor did
the <hi>Tory-party</hi> ever put me to the hardſhip
of aſking this leave, which is the greateſt
obligation I owe to it; and I expect no
greater from the <hi>Whig-party</hi> than the ſame
liberty.—A curſe on the word <hi>Party,</hi>
which I have been forc'd to uſe ſo often

               <p>I Have been acquainted by one of my
friends who omits no opportunities of
gratifying me, that you have lately been
pleas'd to ſpeak of me in a manner which
nothing but the real reſpect I have for
you can deſerve. May I hope that ſome
late malevolencies have loſt their effect?
Indeed it is neither for me, nor my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to pretend to tell you whether I am
your friend or not; but it you would judge
by probabilities, I beg to know which of
your poetical acquaintance has ſo little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in pretending to be ſo? Methinks
no man ſhould queſtion the real friendſhip
of one who deſires no real ſervice: I am
only to get as much from the <hi>Whigs,</hi> as I
got by the <hi>Tories,</hi> that is to ſay, Civility;
being neither ſo proud as to be inſenſible
of any good office, nor ſo humble, as not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0093401002:85"/>
to dare heartily to deſpiſe any man who
does me an injuſtice.</p>
               <p>I will not value my ſelf upon having
ever guarded all the degrees of reſpect for
you; for (to ſay the truth) all the world
ſpeaks well of you, and I ſhould be under
a neceſſity of doing the ſame, whether I
car'd for you or not.</p>
               <p>As to what you have ſaid of me, I ſhall
never believe that the Author of <hi>Cato</hi> can
ſpeak one thing and think another. As a
proof that I account you ſincere, I beg a
favour of you: It is, that you would look
over the two firſt books of my tranſlation
of <hi>Homer,</hi> which are now in the hands of
my Lord <hi>Halifax.</hi> I am ſenſible how much
the reputation of any poetical work will
depend upon the character you give it:
'tis therefore ſome evidence of the truſt I
repoſe in your good will, when I give you
this opportunity of ſpeaking ill of me with
juſtice, and yet expect you will tell me your
trueſt thoughts, at the ſame time that you
tell others your moſt favourable ones.</p>
               <p>I have a farther requeſt, which I muſt
preſs with earneſtneſs, My Bookſeller is
reprinting the <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> to which
you have done too much honour in your
<hi>Spectator</hi> of N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 253. The period in that

ſome ſtrokes of ill nature into that Eſſay,"</q>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0093401002:86"/>
is the only one I could wiſh omitted of all
you have written: but I wou'd not deſire
it ſhould be ſo, unleſs I had the merit of
removing your objection: I beg you but to
point out thoſe ſtrokes to me, and you
may be aſſured they ſhall be treated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy.</p>
               <p>Since we are upon proofs of ſincerity
(which I am pretty confident will turn to
the advantage of us both in each others
opinion) give me leave to name another

You were not miſtaken in what you judg'd
of my temper of mind when I writ laſt.
My faults will not be hid from you, and
perhaps it is no diſpraiſe to me that they

               <p>You do no more than anſwer my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations

can wave the ceremonial. A Friend is
the only one that will bear the omiſſion;
and one may find who is not ſo, by the

               <p>As to any anxiety I have concerning the
fate of my <hi>Homer,</hi> the care is over with
me. The world muſt be the judge, and I
ſhall be the firſt to conſent to the juſtice of

if I am in the wrong, all mankind ſhould

               <p>THE Farce of the <hi>What-d'ye-call-it,</hi>
has occaſioned many different ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
in the town. Some look'd upon it as
meer jeſt upon the tragic poets, others as a
ſatire upon the late war. Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi>
hearing none of the words, and ſeeing the
action to be tragical, was much aſtoniſhed
to find the audience laugh; and ſays, the
Prince and Princeſs muſt doubtleſs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no leſs amazement on the ſame account.
Several templers, and others of the more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0093401002:91"/>
vociferous kind of criticks, went with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to hiſs, and confeſt they were forced
to laugh ſo much, that they forgot the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
they came with. The Court in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
has in a very particular manner come
into the jeſt, and the three firſt Nights,
(notwithſtanding two of them were court-nights)
were diſtinguiſh'd by very full audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the firſt quality. The common
people of the pit and gallery, receiv'd it
at firſt with great gravity and ſedateneſs,
ſome few with tears; but after the third
day they alſo took the hint, and have ever
ſince been very loud in their claps. There
are ſtill ſome ſober men who cannot be of
the general opinion, but the laughers are
ſo much the majority, that one or two
criticks ſeem determined to undeceive the
town at their proper coſt, by writing grave
diſſertations againſt it: To encourage them

give you an account of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
company ſhe had on the road; which
ſince ſhe cannot do, I will.</p>
               <p>It was the enterprizing Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> the
redoubtable rival of Mr. <hi>Tonſon,</hi> who mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a ſtonehorſe, (no diſagreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to your Lordſhip's mare) overtook me
in <hi>Windſor-foreſt.</hi> He ſaid, he heard I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for <hi>Oxford,</hi> the ſeat of the muſes, and
would, as my bookſeller, by all means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me thither.</p>
               <p>I aſk'd him where he got his horſe? He
anſwer'd, he got it of his publiſher: <q rend="inline">"For
that rogue, my printer, (ſaid he) diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
me: I hoped to put him in good
humour by a treat at the tavern, of a
brown fricaſſee of rabbits which coſt two
ſhillings, with two quarts of wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
my converſation. I thought myſelf
cockſure of his horſe, which he readily
promis'd me, but ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi>
had juſt ſuch another deſign of going to
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> expecting there the copy of
<hi>a Comment upon the Revelations</hi>; and if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0093401002:97"/>
Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> went, he was preingag'd to
attend him, being to have the printing
of the ſaid copy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>So in ſhort, I borrow'd this ſtonehorſe of
my publiſher, which he had of Mr. <hi>Old-mixon</hi>
for a debt; he lent me too the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
boy you ſee after me; he was a ſmutty
dog yeſterday, and coſt me near two hours
to waſh the ink off his face: but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very
forward in his catechiſe: if you have any
more baggs, he ſhall carry them.</p>
               <p>I thought Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>'s civility not to
be neglected, ſo gave the boy a ſmall bagg,
containing three ſhirts and an Elzevir <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>;
and mounting in an inſtant procceded
on the road, with my man before, my
curteous ſtationer beſide, and the aforeſaid
Devil behind.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> began in this manner. <q rend="inline">"Now
damn them! what if they ſhould put it
into the news-paper, how you and I

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>As Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> was talking, I obſerv'd
he ſate uneaſy on his ſaddle, for which I
expreſs'd ſome ſollicitude: Nothing ſays he,
I can bear it well enough; but ſince we
have the day before us, methinks it would
be very pleaſant for you to reſt a-while
under the Woods. When were alighted,
<q rend="inline">"See here, what a mighty pretty <hi>Horace</hi> I
have in my pocket? what if you amus'd
your ſelf in turning an Ode, till we mount

my ſpirits. Then jog on apace, and I'll
think as hard as I can.</p>
               <p>Silence enſu'd for a full hour; after

I'll give you one inſtance of my manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>—I congratulate you upon Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s
firſt Book. It does not indeed want its
merit; but I was ſtrangely diſappointed in
my expectation of a Tranſlation nicely true
to the original; whereas in thoſe parts
where the greateſt exactneſs ſeems to be
demanded, he has been the leaſt careful,
I mean the Hiſtory of <hi>ancient Ceremonies

               <p>I Lay hold of the opportunity given me
by my Lord Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0093401002:108"/>
aſſure you of the continuance of that eſteem
and affection I have long born you, and
the memory of ſo many agreeable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
as we have paſs'd together. I wiſh
it were a compliment to ſay ſuch conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
as are not to be found on this ſide
of the Water: for the Spirit of Diſſention
is gone forth among us; nor is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that <hi>Button</hi>'s is no longer <hi>Button</hi>'s, when
<hi>Old England</hi> is no longer <hi>Old England,</hi> that
region of hoſpitality, ſociety, and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
Party affects us all, even the wits,
tho' they gain as little by politicks as they
do by their wit. We talk much of fine
ſenſe, refin'd ſenſe, and exalted ſenſe; but
for uſe and happineſs give me a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe. I ſay this in regard to ſome
gentlemen, profeſs'd wits of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who fancy they can make Poetry of
conſequence at this time of day, in the
midſt of this raging fit of Politicks. For
they tell me, the buſy part of the nation are
not more divided about <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi>
than theſe idle fellows of the Feather about
Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s and my Tranſlation. I (like
the <hi>Tories</hi>) have the town in general, that
is the mob, on my ſide; but 'tis uſual with
the ſmaller Party to make up in induſtry
what they want in number, and that's the
caſe with the little Senate of <hi>Cato.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if our Principles be well conſider'd, I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0093401002:109"/>
muſt appear a brave <hi>Whig,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi> a
rank <hi>Tory</hi>; I tranſlated <hi>Homer</hi> for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
in general, he to gratify the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
deſires of One man only. We have
it ſeems, a great <hi>Turk</hi> in Poetry, who can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bear a Brother on the throne; and has
his Mutes too, a ſett of Nodders, Winkers,
and Whiſperers, whoſe buſineſs is to ſtrangle
all other offsprings of wit in their birth.
The new Tranſlator of <hi>Homer</hi> is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
ſlave he has, that is to ſay, his firſt
Miniſter; let him receive the honours he
gives him, but receive them with fear and
trembling: let him be proud of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of his abſolute Lord; I appeal
to the People, as my rightful judges and
maſters; and if they are not inclin'd to
condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high-flying
proceedings from the ſmall Court-faction
at <hi>Button</hi>'s. But after all I have ſaid
of this great Man, there is no rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us: We are each of us ſo civil and
obliging, that neither thinks he is obliged.
And I for my part treat with him, as we
do with the <hi>Grand Monarch</hi>; who has too
many great qualities not to be reſpected,
tho' we know he watches any occaſion to
oppreſs us.</p>
               <p>When I talk of <hi>Homer,</hi> I muſt not forget
the early Preſent you made me of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur

I can pray for oppoſite parties, and for

               <p>THAT you have not heard from me
of late, aſcribe not to the uſual lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your Correſpondent, but to a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where your name is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
with honour, even in a land flowing
with Tories. I had the good fortune there
to be often in the converſation of Doctor
<hi>Clarke:</hi> He entertain'd me with ſeveral
Drawings, and particularly with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
deſigns of <hi>Inigo Jones</hi>'s <hi>Whitehall.</hi> I
there ſaw and reverenced ſome of your firſt
Pieces; which future Painters are to look
upon as we Poets do on the <hi>Culex</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
and <hi>Batrachom.</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having named this latter piece, give me
leave to aſk what is become of Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi>
and his Frogs? <hi>Oblituſque meorum, obliviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendus
&amp; illis,</hi> might be <hi>Horace</hi>'s wiſh, but
will never be mine, while I have ſuch <hi>meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums</hi>
as Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> I hope
the ſpring will reſtore you to us, and
with you all the beauties and colours of
nature. Not but I congratulate you on the
pleaſure you muſt take in being admir'd in
your own Country, which ſo ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to Prophets and Poets. But in this you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0093401002:121"/>
have the Advantage of Poets; you are
Maſter of an Art that muſt proſper and
grow rich, as long as people love, or are
proud of themſelves, or their own perſons.
However, you have ſtay'd long enough, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
to have painted all the numberleſs
Hiſtories of old <hi>Ogygiae.</hi> If you have begun
to be Hiſtorical, I recommend to your
hand the ſtory which every pious <hi>Iriſhman</hi>
ought to begin with, that of St. <hi>Patrick:</hi>
To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. P.
was, when he tranſlated the <hi>Batrachomuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia</hi>)
to come into <hi>England</hi> to copy the
Frogs, and ſuch other Vermine as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen in that land ſince the time of that
Confeſſor.</p>
               <p>I long to ſee you a Hiſtory Painter. You
have already done enough for the Private,
do ſomething for the Publick; and be not
confined, like the reſt, to draw only ſuch
ſilly ſtories as our own faces tell of us. The
Ancients too expect you ſhould do them
right; thoſe Statues from which you learn'd
your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it
as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make
them truly known to all nations, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you intend to write of their <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
I hope you think more warmly than
ever of that noble deſign.</p>
               <p>As to your enquiry about your Houſe,
when I come within the walls, they put
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0093401002:122"/>
me in mind of thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where
your Friend, like the wandring <hi>Trojan,</hi>
                  <q>Animunt Pictura paſcit inani.</q>
For the ſpacious Manſion, like a <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Caravanſerah, entertains the Vagabond with
only bare Lodging. I rule the Family very
ill, keep bad Hours, and lend out your
Pictures about the Town. See what it is
to have a Poet in your Houſe! <hi>Frank</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
does all he can in ſuch a Circumſtance,
for conſidering he has a wild Beaſt in it,
he conſtantly keeps the Door chain'd.
Every time it is open'd, the Links rattle,
the ruſty Hinges roar, the Houſe ſeems
ſo ſenſible that you are its ſupport, that it
is ready to drop in your Abſence; but I
ſtill truſt my ſelf under its Roof, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Providence will preſerve ſo many
<hi>Raphaels, Titian's</hi> and <hi>Guido's,</hi> as are lodg'd
in your Cabinet. Surely the Sins of one
Poet can hardly be ſo heavy, as to bring
an old Houſe over the Heads of ſo many
Painters. In a word, your Houſe is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but what of that? I am only a
Lodger.</p>

               <p>LAST poſt brought me the favour of
your letter of the 10th <hi>Aug. O. S.</hi> It

that 'twas a Witty one; I never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

pleaſes me, and can aſſure you, it was a very
Agreeable one. The proof I can give you of
my ſincerity in this Opinion, is, that I hope
and deſire you would not ſtop at this, but
continue more of them.</p>
               <p>I am in a place where Pleaſure is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
flowing. The Princes ſet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and the Subjects follow at a diſtance.
The Ladies are of all parties, by which
means the converſation of the Men is very
much ſoftned and faſhioned from thoſe
blunt diſputes on Politicks, and rough Jeſts,
we are ſo guilty of; while the Freedom of
the Women takes away all Formality and
Conſtraint. I muſt own, at the ſame time,
theſe Beauties are a little too artificial for
my Taſte; you have ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Picture,
the Original is more painted, and ſuch a
cruſt of Powder and eſſence in their Hair,
that you can ſee no difference between

black and red. By diſuſing Stays, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging

               <p>I Have long had it in my thoughts to
trouble you with a Letter, but was
diſcouraged for want of ſomething that I
could think worth ſending fifteen hundred
Miles. <hi>Italy</hi> is ſuch an exhauſted Subject,
that, I dare ſay, you'd eaſily forgive my
ſaying nothing of it; and the imagination
of a Poet, is a thing ſo nice and delicate,
that it is no eaſy matter to find out Images
capable of giving Pleaſure to one of the
few, who (in any Age) have come up to
that Character. I am nevertheleſs lately
return'd from an Iſland, where I paſſed three
or four Months, which, were it ſet out in
its true Colours, might methinks amuſe
you agreeably enough for a minute or two.
The Iſland <hi>Inarime,</hi> is an Epitome of the
whole Earth, containing within the compaſs
of eighteen Miles, a wonderful variety of
Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains,
and barren Mountains, all thrown together
in a moſt romantic Confuſion. The Air is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0093401002:126"/>
in the hotteſt Seaſon, conſtantly refreſhed
by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales
produce excellent Wheat and <hi>Indian</hi> Corn,
but are moſtly covered with Vineyards, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
with Fruit-trees. Beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they produce Oranges, Limes,
Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
and many other Fruits unknown to
our Climates, which lie every where open
to the Paſſenger. The Hills are the greater
part covered to the top with Vines, ſome
with Cheſnut Groves, and others with
thickets of Myrtle and Lentiſcus. The
Fields in the Northern ſide are divided by
hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Fountains
and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
which is likewiſe ſet off by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of ſome barren Spots, and naked Rocks.
But that which crowns the Scene, is a large
Mountain, riſing out of the middle of the
Iſland (once a terrible <hi>Volcano,</hi> by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
called <hi>Mons Epomeus</hi>) its lower parts
are adorned with Vines, and other Fruits,
the middle affords Paſture to flocks of Goats
and Sheep, and the top is a ſandy pointed
Rock, from which you have the fineſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in the World, ſurveying at one view,
beſides ſeveral pleaſant Iſlands lying at your
Feet, a tract of <hi>Italy</hi> about three hundred
Miles in length, from the Promontory of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0093401002:127"/>
                  <hi>Antium,</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Palinurus.</hi> The
greater part of which, hath been ſung by
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as making a conſiderable
part of the Travels and Adventures of their
two Heroes. The Iſlands <hi>Caprea, Prochyta,</hi>
and <hi>Parthenope,</hi> together with <hi>Cajeta, Cumae,</hi>
                  <hi>Monte Miſeno,</hi> the Habitations of <hi>Circe,</hi>
the <hi>Syrens,</hi> and the <hi>Leſtrygones,</hi> the Bay
of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Promontory of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and
the whole <hi>Campagnia felice,</hi> make but a
part of this noble Landſcape; which would
demand an Imagination as warm, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
as flowing as your own, to deſcribe it.
The Inhabitants of this delicious Iſle, as
they are without Riches and Honours, ſo
are they without the Vices and Follies that
attend them; and were they but as much
ſtrangers to Revenge, as they are to Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
or Ambition, they might in fact anſwer
the poetical Notions of the Golden Age.
But they have got, as an alloy to their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
an ill habit of murdering one
another on ſlight Offences. We had an
Inſtance of this the ſecond Night after our
Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being ſhot
dead by our Door: And yet by the ſole ſecret
of minding our own Buſineſs, we found
a means of living ſecurely among theſe
dangerous People. Would you know how
we paſs the time at <hi>Naples?</hi> Our chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
is the Devotion of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0093401002:128"/>
Beſides the gayety of their Churches
(where Folks go to ſee what they call <hi>una
bella Devotione</hi> (i. e.) a ſort of Religious
Opera) they make Fireworks almoſt every
Week, out of Devotion; the Streets are
often hung with Arras, out of Devotion;
and (what is ſtill more ſtrange) the Ladies
invite Gentlemen to their Houſes, and treat
them with Muſick and Sweetmeats, out of
Devotion; in a word, were it not for this
Devotion of its Inhabitants, <hi>Naples</hi> would
have little elſe to recommend it, beſide the
Air and Situation. Learning is in no very
thriving ſtate here, as indeed no where elſe
in <hi>Italy.</hi> However, among many pretenders,
ſome Men of taſte are to be met with. A
Friend of mine told me not long ſince,
that being to viſit <hi>Salvini</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> he
found him reading your <hi>Homer.</hi> He liked
the Notes extreamly, and could find no
other fault with the Verſion, but that he
thought it approached too near a Paraphraſe;
which ſhews him not to be ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with our Language. I wiſh you
Health to go on with that noble Work, and
when you have that, I need not wiſh
you Succeſs. You will do me the Juſtice

Poſterity (which no doubt will be made

               <p>I Had pleas'd myſelf ſooner in writing
to you, but that I have been your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
in a Fit of Sickneſs, and am not yet
ſo much recovered, but that I have thoughts
of uſing your <note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſes.</note> Phyſicians. They are as
grave Perſons as any of the Faculty, and
(like the Antients) carry their own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments
about with them. But indeed the
Moderns are ſuch lovers of Raillery, that
nothing is grave enough to eſcape them.
Let 'em laugh, but People will ſill have
their Opinions: As they think our Doctors
Aſſes to them, we'll think them Aſſes to
our Doctors.</p>

I am glad you are ſo much in a better
ſtate of Health, as to allow me to jeſt
about it. My concern, when I heard of
your Danger, was ſo very ſerious, that I
almoſt take it ill Dr. <hi>Evans</hi> ſhould tell you
of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly,
if you and a few more ſuch people were to
leave the World, I would not give ſix-pence
to ſtay in it.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo much concern'd as to the
point, whether you are to live fat or lean:
Moſt Men of Wit or Honeſty are uſually
decreed to live very lean; ſo I am inclined
to the opinion that 'tis decreed you ſhall:
However be comforted, and reflect that
you'll make the better Buſto for it.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſomething particular in you, not to
be ſatisfied with ſending me your own
Books, but to make your Acquaintance
continue the frolick. Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> forc'd
me to take <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> which has ſince done
me great credit with ſeveral people, as it
has done <hi>Dryden</hi> and <hi>Oldham</hi> ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs,
in ſhewing there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between their <hi>Gorbuduc,</hi> and this,
as between Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and King <hi>George.</hi>
It is truly a <hi>ſcandal,</hi> that Men ſhould
write with contempt of a Piece which
they never once ſaw, as thoſe two Poets
did, who were ignorant even of the Sex,
as well as Senſe, of <hi>Gorboduc.</hi>

               <p>TO convince you how little pain I
give myſelf, in correſponding with
Men of good Nature, and good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you ſee I omit to anſwer your Letters
till a time, when another man would be
aſhamed to own he had received them. If
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0093401002:137"/>
therefore you are ever moved on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
by that Spirit; which I take to be
as ſamiliar to you as a Quotidian Ague,
I mean the Spirit of Goodneſs, pray never
ſtint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
beyond my natural Inclination: I dare
truſt you, Sir, not only with my Folly
when I write, but with my Negligence
when I do not; and expect equally your
pardon for either.</p>
               <p>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the
reſt of this Paper, it ſhould be ſpotted and
diverſified with Conceits all over; you
ſhould be put out of breath with Laughter
at each Sentence, and pauſe at each Period,
to look back over how much Wit you had
paſs'd. But I have found by experience,
that people now a-days regard Writing as
little as they do Preaching: The moſt we
can hope is to be heard, juſt with Decency
and Patience, once a week, by Folks in the
Country: Here in Town we hum over a
piece of fine Writing, and we whiſtle at a
Sermon. The Stage is the only place we
ſeem alive at; there indeed we ſtare, and
roar, and clap hands for K. <hi>George</hi> and the
Government. As for all other Virtues but
this Loyalty, they are an obſolete Train,
ſo ill-dreſs'd, that Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
hiſs 'em out of all good Company.
Humility knocks ſo ſneakingly at the door,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0093401002:138"/>
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes
it give way to the free Entrance of Pride,
Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</p>
               <p>My Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> from having ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in your Company too long, really
behaves herſelf ſcandalouſly amongſt us: She
pretends to open her eyes for the ſake of
ſeeing the Sun, and to ſleep becauſe it is
Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and is thought to have ſaid her Prayers
before; talks without any manner of ſhame
of good Books, and has not ſeen <hi>Cibber</hi>'s
Play of the <hi>Non-juror.</hi> I rejoyced the other
day to ſee a Libel on her Toilette, which
gives me ſome hope that you have at leaſt
a Taſte of Scandal left you, in defect of all
other Vices.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, I heartily wiſh
you well; but as I cannot entirely deſire
the ruin of all the Joys of this City, ſo all
that remains is to wiſh you wou'd keep

               <p>YOU'LL think me very full of my ſelf,
when after a long Silence (which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0093401002:139"/>
however to ſay truth has rather been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to contemplate of you, than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
you) I begin to talk of my own Works.
I find it is in the Finiſhing a Book, as in
concluding a Seſſion of Parliament, one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was
thinks it will be very ſoon, and finds
it very late. There are many unlook'd-for
Incidents to retard the Clearing <hi>any publick
Account,</hi> and ſo I ſee it is in mine. I have
plagued my ſelf, like great Miniſters, with
undertaking too much for one Man, and
with a Deſire of doing more than was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from me, have done leſs than I ought.</p>
               <p>For having deſign'd Four very laborious
and uncommon ſorts of Indexes to <hi>Homer,</hi>
I'm forced, for want of time, to publiſh
two only; the deſign of which you will own
to be pretty, tho' far from being fully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
I've alſo been oblig'd to leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſh'd
in my deſk the Heads of two Eſſays,
one on the <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi>
and another on the <hi>Oratory</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> and
<hi>Virgil.</hi> So they muſt wait for future Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or periſh; and (one way or other, no
great matter which) <hi>dabit Deus his quoque
finem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think of you every day, I aſſire you,
even without ſuch good Memorials of you
as your Siſters, with whom I ſometimes talk
of you, and find it one of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0093401002:140"/>
                  <hi>Digby</hi> muſt be perpetually remember'd by

There needs no more than an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with your Family, to make all
Elder Sons wiſh they had Fathers to their
lives end.</p>
               <p>I can't touch upon the ſubject of filial
Love, without putting you in mind of an
old Woman, who has a ſincere, hearty, old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd
reſpect for you, and conſtantly
blames her Son for not having writ to you
oftner, to tell you ſo.</p>
               <p>I very much wiſh (but what ſignifies my
wiſhing? my Lady <hi>Scudamore wiſhes,</hi> your
Siſters wiſh) that you were with us, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the beautiful Contraſte this Seaſon affords
us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas
you could form in the Winter can make you
imagine what <hi>Twickenham</hi> is (and what
your Friend Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Twickenham</hi> is)
in this warmer Seaſon. Our River glitters
beneath an unclouded Sun, at the ſame time
that its Banks retain the Verdure of Showers:
Our Gardens are offering their firſt Noſegays;
our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought
happily together, are ſtretching their Arms
to meet each other, and growing nearer and
nearer every hour: The Birds are paying
their thankſgiving Songs for the new Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
I have made 'em: My Building
riſes high enough to attract the eye and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0093401002:141"/>
curioſity of the Paſſenger from the River,
where, upon beholding a mixture of Beauty
and Ruin, he enquires what houſe is falling,
or what Church is riſing? So little taſte

whatever delight the true, unſeen, poetical

two for Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> when ſhe will do

               <p>YOUR Doctor is going to the <hi>Bath,</hi>
and ſtays a Fortnight or more: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you would be comforted to have a
Sight of him, whether you need him or
not. I think him as good a Doctor as any
for one that is ill, and a better Doctor than
any one for one that is well. He would
do admirably for Mrs. <hi>Mary Digby:</hi> She
needed only to follow his Hints, to be in
eternal buſineſs and amuſement of mind,
and even as active as ſhe could deſire. But
indeed I fear ſhe would out-walk him: For
(as Dean <hi>Swift</hi> obſerv'd to me the very firſt
time I ſaw the Doctor) <hi>He is a Man that can
do every thing, but walk.</hi> His Brother, who
is lately come into <hi>England,</hi> goes alſo to the
<hi>Bath</hi>; and is a more extraordinary Man than
he, worth your going thither on purpoſe to
know him. The Spirit of <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> ſo
long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him:
He is a Philoſopher all of fire; ſo warmly,
nay ſo wildly in the right, that he forces all
others about him to be ſo too, and draws
them into his own <hi>Vortex.</hi> He is a Star that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0093401002:145"/>
looks as if it were all Fire, but is all Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
all gentle and beneficial Influence.
If there be other men in the world that
would ſerve a Friend, yet He is the only one
I believe that could make even an Enemy
ſerve a Friend.</p>
               <p>As all human Life is chequer'd and mixed
with Acquiſitions and Loſſes (tho' the latter
are more certain and irremediable, than the
former laſting or ſatisfactory) ſo at the time
I have gain'd the acquaintance of one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Man I have loſt another, a very eaſy,
humane, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr.
<hi>Stonor.</hi> It's certain the Loſs of one of this
Character puts us naturally upon ſetting a
greater Value on the few that are left, tho'
the degree of our Eſteem may be different.
Nothing, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> is ſo melancholy a
circumſtance in human life, or ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles
us to the thought of our own death,
as the reflection and proſpect of one Friend
after another dropping round us! Who
would ſtand alone, the ſole remaining Ruin,

               <p>YOUR making a ſort of Apology for
your not writing, is a very genteel
reproof to me. I know I was to blame,
but I know I did not intend to be ſo, and
(what is the happieſt Knowledge in the
World) I know you will forgive me: For
ſure nothing is more ſatisfactory than to
be certain of ſuch a Friend as will overlook
one's failings, ſince every ſuch inſtance is
a Conviction of his Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>If I am all my life to dwell in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and never riſe to Actions, I have
but too much need of that gentle diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I experience in you. But I hope
better things of myſelf, and fully purpoſe
to make you a viſit this Summer at <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn.</hi>
I'm told you are all upon removal
very ſpeedily, and that Mrs. <hi>Mary Digby</hi>
talks in a Letter to Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> of
ſeeing my Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi>'s Wood in her
way. How much I wiſh to be her Guide
thro' that enchanted Foreſt, is not to be
expreſt: I look upon myſelf as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
appropriated to the place, without
whom no mortal can penetrate into the
Receſſes of thoſe ſacred Shades. I could
paſs whole Days, in only deſcribing to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0093401002:149"/>
her the future, and as yet viſionary Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that are to riſe in thoſe Scenes:
The Palace that is to be built, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villions
that are to glitter, the Colonnades
that are to adorn them: Nay more, the
meeting of the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Severn,</hi>
which (when the noble Owner has finer
Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into
each others Embraces thro' ſecret Caverns
of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till
they riſe and openly celebrate their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in the midſt of an immenſe Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre,
which is to be the Admiration of
Poſterity a hundred Years hence. But till
the deſtin'd time ſhall arrive that is to
manifeſt theſe Wonders, Mrs. <hi>Digby</hi> muſt
content herſelf with ſeeing what is at

in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Objects that attract this part of

Women of Quality are all turn'd
Followers of the <hi>Camp</hi> in <hi>Hyde-Park</hi>
this Year, whither all the Town reſort to
magnificent Entertainments given by the
Officers, &amp;c. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Ladies that
dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not
more cloſely attached to the Luggage.
The Matrons, like thoſe of <hi>Sparta,</hi> attend
their Sons to the Field, to be the Witneſſes
of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0093401002:150"/>
with all their Charms diſplay'd, provoke the
Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the place of <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> black Broth.
This Camp ſeems crowned with perpetual

your Abſence from <hi>London,</hi> for I could

call it) into other Creatures, in that Scene
of Folly Militant, when you may reign for

I appeal to a Third Lady in your

and Cuſtom, of you all; I appeal to Her,
if you are not every Soul of you better Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

               <p>IT is now the Seaſon to wiſh you a good
End of one Year, and a happy Beginning
of another: but both theſe you know how
to make yourſelf, by only continuing ſuch
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0093401002:161"/>
a Life as you have been long accuſtomed to
lead. As for Good Works, they are things
I dare not name, either to thoſe that do
them, or to thoſe that do them not; the firſt
are too modeſt, and the latter too ſelfiſh, to
bear the mention of what are become either
too old-faſhion'd, or too private, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
any Part of the Vanity or Reputation
of the preſent Age. However, it were to
be wiſh'd People would now and then look
upon Good Works as they do upon old
Wardrobes, meerly in caſe any of'em ſhould
by chance come into Faſhion again; as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd
Petticoats, (which may be properly compar'd
to Charities, as they cover a multitude of
Sins.)</p>
               <p>They tell me that at—certain anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
Charities, and obſolete Devotions are
yet ſubſiſting: That a thing called Chriſtian
Chearfulneſs, (not incompatible with <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Pyes and Plum-broth) whereof frequent
is the mention in old Sermons and Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks,
is really kept alive and in Practiſe:
That feeding the Hungry, and giving Alms
to the Poor, do yet make a Part of good
Houſe-keeping, in a Latitude not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from <hi>London</hi> than fourſcore Miles:
And laſtly, that Prayers and Roaſt-beef
actually make ſome People as happy, as a
Whore and a Bottle. But here in Town
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0093401002:162"/>
I aſſure you, Men, Women, and Children
have done with theſe things. Charity not
only begins, but ends, at home. Inſtead of
the four Cardinal Virtues, now reign four
Princely ones: We have Cunning for Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Rapine for Juſtice, Time-ſerving for
Fortitude, and Luxury for Temperance.
Whatever you may fancy where you live

               <p>I Know of nothing that will be ſo Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing
to you at preſent, as ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the laſt Act of that eminent
Comick Poet, and our Friend, <hi>Wycherly.</hi>
He had often told me, as I doubt not he did
all his Acquaintance, that he would Marry
as ſoon as his life was deſpair'd of. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
a few days before his Death he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
the Ceremony; and join'd together
thoſe two Sacraments which wiſe Men ſay
ſhould be the laſt we receive; For if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0093401002:165"/>
Unction in our Catechiſm, as a kind of Hint
of the Order of Time in which they are to
be taken. The old Man then lay down,
ſatisfy'd in the Conſcience of having,
by this one Act paid his juſt Debts, obliged
a Woman who (he was told) had Merit, and
ſhewn an heroick reſentment of the ill uſage
of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds
which he had with the Lady, diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe Debts; a Jointure of four hundred
a year made her a Recompenſe; and the
Nephew he left to comfort himſelf as well
as he could, with the miſerable Remains of
a mortgaged Eſtate. I ſaw our Friend
twice after this was done, leſs peeviſh in
his Sickneſs than he uſed to be in his Health;
neither much afraid of Dying, nor (which in
him had been more likely) much aſhamed
of Marrying. The Evening before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
he called his young Wife to the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and earneſtly entreated her not to deny
him one requeſt, the laſt he ſhould make.
Upon her Aſſurances of conſenting to it, he
told her, <hi>My Dear, it is only this; that you
will never marry an old Man again.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help remarking, that Sickneſs which
often deſtroys both Wit and Wiſdom, yet
ſeldom has power to remove that Talent
which we call <hi>Humour:</hi> Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>
ſhew'd his, even in this laſt Compliment;
tho' I think his requeſt a little hard; for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0093401002:166"/>
why ſhould he bar her from doubling her
Jointure on the ſame eaſy Terms?</p>
               <p>So trivial as theſe Circumſtances are, I
ſhould not be diſpleas'd my ſelf to know
ſuch Trifles, when they concern or charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſe
any eminent Perſon. The wiſeſt and
wittieſt of Men are ſeldom wiſer or wittier
than others in theſe ſober Moments. At leaſt,
our Friend ended much in the Character he
had lived in: And <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule for a Play
may as well be apply'd to him as a Playwright,

               <p>I Am juſt return'd from the Country'
whither Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> accompanied me, and
paſs'd a Week in the Foreſt. I need not tell
you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd
me; but I muſt acquaint you there is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity
and Gaiety of Diſpoſition almoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to him, which make it impoſſible to
part from him without that uneaſineſs which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0093401002:167"/>
generally ſucceeds all our pleaſures. I have
been juſt taking a ſolitary walk by Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine,
full of reflections on the tranſitory na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all human delights; and giving my
Thoughts a looſe in the contemplation of
thoſe Satisfactions which probably we may
hereafter taſte in the Company of ſeparate
Spirits, when we ſhall range the Walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and perhaps gaze on this World at as
vaſt a diſtance as we now do on thoſe
Worlds. The pleaſures we are to enjoy in
that Converſation muſt undoubtedly be of
a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Diſcoveries each ſhall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to another, of God and of Nature;
for the Happineſs of Minds can ſurely be
nothing but Knowledge.</p>
               <p>The higheſt Gratification we receive here
from Company is <hi>Mirth,</hi> which at the beſt
is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that
beats about the breaſt for a few Moments,
and after leaves it void and empty.</p>
               <p>Keeping good Company, even the beſt,
is but a leſs ſhameful Art of loſing Time.</p>
               <p>What we here call <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi> are
little better: The greater number of Arts
to which we apply ourſelves are mere Grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Dark; and even the ſearch of our
moſt important Concerns in a future being,
is but a needleſs, anxious, and uncertain
haſte to be knowing, ſooner than we can,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0093401002:168"/>
what without all this ſollicitude we ſhall
know a little later. We are but <hi>Curious
Impertinents</hi> in the caſe of Futurity. 'Tis
not our buſineſs to be gueſſing what the State
of Souls ſhall be, but to be doing what may
make our own State happy; We cannot be
Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</p>
               <p>If this be my Notion of a great part of
that high Science, Divinity; you will be ſo
civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Streſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reſt. Even of my darling Poetry I
really make no other uſe, than Horſes of the
Bells that gingle about their Ears (tho' now
and then they toſs their Heads as if they
were proud of 'em) only to Jogg on a little
more merrily.</p>
               <p>Your Obſervations on the narrow concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Mankind in the point of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
confirm me in what I was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as at my firſt knowledge of you to
hope, and ſince ſo amply to experience. Let
me take ſo much decent Pride and Dignity
upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
like theſe, which I diſcover'd in your
Mind, I had never made the Trial I have
done; which has ſucceeded ſo much to mine,
and I believe not leſs to your Satisfaction:
For if I know you right, your Pleaſure is
greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my
part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</p>

Your Remark, that the Variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Politicks or Religion is often rather
a Gratification, than Objection, to people
who have Senſe enough to conſider the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
order of Nature in her Variations;
makes me think you have not conſtrued
<hi>Joannes Secundus</hi> wrong, in the Verſe which
precedes that which you quote: <hi>Bene nota
Fides,</hi> as I take it, does no way ſignify the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Religion, tho' <hi>Secundus</hi>
was of it. I think it was a generous thought,
and one that flow'd from an exalted mind,
that it was not improbable but God might
be delighted with the various methods of
worſhipping him, which divided the whole
World. I am pretty ſure You and I ſhould
no more make good <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Tyrants in Faith, than we could have
been qualify'd for <hi>Lictors</hi> to <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> when
he converted refractory Members with the
Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you
what I think I have formerly ſaid; that I as
little fear God will damn a Man who has
Charity, as I hope that any Prieſt cans ſave
him without it.</p>

               <p>I Find that a real concern is not only a
Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing
too: The more time we give our ſelves to
think over one's own, or a Friends unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the more unable we grow to expreſs the
grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural
to delay a Letter, at ſuch a Seaſon as this,
as to retard a melancholy Viſit to a Perſon
one cannot relieve. One is aſhamed in
that Circumſtance, to pretend to entertain
people with trifling, inſignificant affectations
of Sorrow on the one hand, or unſeaſonable
and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a
kind of profanation of things ſacred; to
treat ſo ſolemn a matter as a generous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Suffering, with Compliments or
Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as
your's has no need of being Spirited up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Honour, or like a weak Woman, Praiſed
into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis
enough to do and ſuffer what we ought;
and Men ſhould know, that the noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Suffering bravely is as far above that
of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemiſh'd
Conſcience and inflexible Reſolution are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0093401002:171"/>
an accidential Flow of Spirits, or a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious
Buſineſs of Mankind be included in Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creatures; there are now ſome People
who give us the Opportunity of affording as
bright an Example in practiſing the one, as
themſelves have given an infamous Inſtance
of the Violation of the other. Whoever is
really brave, has always this Comfort when
he is oppreſt, that he knows himſelf to be
ſuperior to thoſe who injure him: For the
greateſt Power on Earth can no ſooner do
him that Injury, but the brave Man can
make himſelf greater by forgiving it.</p>
               <p>If it were generous to ſeek for allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Conſolations in a Calamity of ſo much
Glory, one might ſay that to be ruin'd thus
in the Groſs, with a whole People, is but
like periſhing in the General Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where nothing we can value is left
behind us.</p>
               <p>Methinks in our preſent Condition, the
moſt heroic thing we are left capable of
doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's
Load, and (oppreſt as we are) to ſuccour
ſuch as are yet more oppreſt. If there are
too many who cannot be aſſiſted but by
what we cannot give, our Money, there are
yet others who may be relieved by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
by our Countenance, and even by our
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0093401002:172"/>
Chearfulneſs. The Misfortunes of private
Families, the Miſunderſtandings of People
whom Diſtreſſes make ſuſpicious, the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of Relations whom Change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may diſ-unite, or the Neceſſities of half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruin'd
Eſtates render unkind to each other;
theſe at leaſt may be ſoften'd in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
by a general well-manag'd Humanity
among ourſelves, if all thoſe who have your
Principles of Belief, had alſo your Senſe and
Conduct. But indeed moſt of 'em have
given lamentable <note n="†" place="bottom">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <hi>Preſton.</hi>
                  </note> proofs of the contrary;
and 'tis to be apprehended that they who
want Senſe, are only religious thro' weakneſs,
and good-natur'd thro' Shame: Theſe are
narrow-minded Creatures that never deal
in Eſſentials; their Faith never looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Ceremonials, nor their Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Relations. As poor as I am, I would
gladly relieve any diſtreſſed, conſcientious
<hi>French</hi> Refugee at this inſtant: What muſt
my Concern then be, when I perceive
ſo many Anxieties now tearing thoſe Hearts
which I have deſired a place in, and Clouds
of Melancholy riſing on thoſe Faces which
I have long look'd upon with Affection? I
begin already to feel both what ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and what others are yet too ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0093401002:173"/>
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old,
for ſo many additional Incoveniencies, and
Chagrins, more than their ſmall Remain of
Life ſeem'd deſtin'd to undergo; and with the
Young, for ſo many of thoſe Gayeties and
Pleaſures (the Portion of Youth) which they
will by this means be depriv'd of. This
brings into my mind one or other of thoſe
I love beſt, and among them the Widow and
Fatherleſs, late of—As I am certain
no People living had an earlier and truer
Senſe of others Misfortunes, or a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
reſignation as to what might be their
own; ſo I earneſtly wiſh, that whatever
part they muſt bear may be render'd as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to them as it is in the power of
any Friend to make it.</p>
               <p>But I know you have prevented me in
this Thought, as you always will any
thing that's good, or generous: I find by a
Letter of your Lady's (which I have ſeen)
that their Eaſe and Tranquility is part
of your Care. I believe there's ſome Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in it, that you ſhould always, from time
to time, be doing thoſe particular things that
make me enamour'd of you,</p>
               <p>I write this from <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt, of which
I am come to take my laſt look. We here
bid our Neighbours adieu, much as thoſe
who go to be hang'd do their Fellow-Priſoners,

them a few weeks after. I parted from

from old Sir <hi>William Trumball</hi> as from a
venerable Prophet, foretelling with lifted

               <p>Perhaps, now I have learnt ſo far as

               <p>IF a Regard both to Publick and Private
Affairs may plead a lawful Excuſe in
behalf of a negligent Correſpondent, I have
really a very good Title to it: I cannot ſay
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0093401002:175"/>
whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappineſs, that
I am obliged at this time to give up my
whole Application to <hi>Homer</hi>; when without
that Employment, my Thoughts muſt turn
upon what is leſs agreeable, the Violence, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Reſentment of modern War-makers,
which are likely to prove (to ſome People at
leaſt) more fatal, than the ſame Qualities in
<hi>Achilles</hi> did to his unfortunate Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>Tho' the change of my Scene of Life,
from <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt to the Side of the
<hi>Thames,</hi> be one of the grand <hi>Aera's</hi> of my
days, and may be called a notable Period
in ſo inconſiderable a Hiſtory? yet you can
ſcarce imagine any Hero paſſing from one
Stage of Life to another, with ſo much
Tranquility, ſo eaſy a Tranſition, and ſo
laudable a Behaviour. I am become ſo truly
a Citizen of the World (according to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
Expreſſion) that I look with equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
on what I have loſt, and on what
I have gained. The Times and Amuſements
paſt are not more like a Dream to me, than
thoſe which are preſent: I lie in a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kind of Inaction, and have one Comfort
at leaſt from Obſcurity, that the <hi>Darkneſs</hi>
helps me to <hi>ſleep</hi> the better. I now and
then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my
Friends, whom I fancy I remember much
as ſeparate Spirits do us, at tender Intervals,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0093401002:176"/>
neither interrupting their own Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
nor altogether careleſs of ours, but
in general conſtantly wiſhing us well, and
hoping to have us one day in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>To grow indifferent to the World is to
grow Philoſophical, or Religious; (which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
of thoſe Turns we chance to take)
and indeed the World is ſuch a thing as
one that thinks pretty much, muſt either
laugh at, or be angry with: but if we
laugh at it, they ſay we are proud; and if
we are angry with it, they ſay we are ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd.
So the moſt politic Way is to ſeem
always better pleas'd than one can be,
greater Admirers, greater Lovers, and in
ſhort greater Fools, than we really are:
So ſhall we live comfortably with our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd
by our Maſters, and happy with our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes.

on that very Coaſt the happy End of his
Peregrinations and Adventures.</p>
               <p>I have very lately read <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
(to whom your <hi>Cornwall</hi> is not a little
beholden) in the Tranſlation of a Clergyman
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0093401002:178"/>
in my neighbourhood. The poor Man is
highly concerned to vindicate <hi>Jeffery</hi>'s vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
as an Hiſtorian; and told me he was
perfectly aſtoniſhed, we of the <hi>Roman</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
could doubt of the Legends of his
Giants, while we believe thoſe of our Saints?
I am forced to make a fair Compoſition with
him; and, by crediting ſome of the wonders
of <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Gogmagog,</hi> have brought
him ſo far already, that he ſpeaks reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s carrying Chriſt, and
the Reſuſcitation of St. <hi>Nicholas Tolentine</hi>'s
Chickens. Thus we proceed apace in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
each other from all manner of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> are no more compared
to <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> than the <hi>Guelphs</hi>
and <hi>Ghibellines</hi> were to the <hi>Mohocks</hi> of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreadful
memory. This amazing Writer
has made me lay aſide <hi>Homer</hi> for a week,
and when I take him up again, I ſhall be
very well prepared to tranſlate with belief,
and reverence the Speech of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Horſe.</p>
               <p>You'll excuſe all this trifling, or any
thing elſe which prevents a Sheet full of
Compliment: and believe there is nothing
more true (even more true than any thing
in <hi>Jeffery</hi> is falſe) than that I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

               <p>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me
here, for I have been in and about
this Country ever ſince your departure. I
am pleas'd to date this from a place ſo
well known to Mrs. <hi>Blount,</hi> where I write
as if I were dictated by her Anceſtors,
whoſe faces are all upon me. I fear none
ſo much as Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Guiſe,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Shirt, ſeems as ready to combate
me, as her own Sir <hi>John</hi> was to demoliſh
Duke <hi>Lancaſtere.</hi> I date ſay your Lady
will recollect his Figure. I look'd upon
the Manſion, Walls, and Terraces; the
Plantations, and Slopes, which Nature has
made to command a variety of Vallies
and riſing Woods; with a Veneration mixt
with a Pleaſure, that repreſented her to
me in thoſe puerile Amuſements, which
engaged her ſo many Years ago in this
place: I fancy'd I ſaw her ſober over a
Sampler, or gay over a joynted Baby. I
dare ſay ſhe did one thing more, even in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0093401002:182"/>
thoſe early times; <hi>remember'd her Creator
in the Days of her Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You deſcribe ſo well your Hermitical
ſtate of life, that none of the ancient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites
could go beyond you, for a Cave
in a Rock, with a fine Spring, or any of
the Accommodations that befit a Solitary.
Only I don't remember to have read, that
any of thoſe venerable and holy Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
took with them a Lady, and begat
Sons and Daughters. You muſt modeſtly be
content to be accounted a Patriarch. But were
you a little younger, I ſhould rather rank
you with Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> and his fellows. If
Piety be ſo Romantick, I ſhall turn Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in good earneſt; for I ſee one may
go ſo far as to be Poetical, and hope to
ſave one's Soul at the ſame time. I really
wiſh myſelf ſomething more, that is, a
Prophet; for I wiſh I were as <hi>Habakkuk,</hi>
to be taken by the Hair of the Head, and
viſit <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Den. You are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
in ſaying, I have now a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
upon my hands, to whom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the part of a Friend: I aſſure you
I like 'em all ſo well, that I will never
quit my Hereditary Right to them; you
have made me yours, and conſequently them
mine. I ſtill ſee them walking on my Green

up the ſteepeſt Slopes of my Mount.</p>

               <p>YOUR very kind and obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

I ſincerely rejoice at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery

of it. I ſhould have elſe been ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and deeply affected, in the thought of
your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine
and a natural thought, which I lately read
in a private Letter of <hi>Montaigne,</hi> giving an
account of the laſt Words of an intimate
Friend of his: <q rend="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain

               </p>
               <p>I joyn with your Family in giving God
thanks for lending us a worthy Man ſome
what longer. The Comforts you receive
from their Attendance put me in mind of
what old <hi>Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Saltoune</hi> ſaid one day
to me. <q rend="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to

               <p>I hope the Gout will ſoon go after the

As to forgetfulneſs of you or yours, I aſſure
you, the promiſcuous Converſations of the
Town ſerve only to put me in mind of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more quiet, to be had in a Corner
of the World (undiſturb'd, innocent, ſerene,

differently in a cloudy day from what you
do in the moſt ſun-ſhiny Weather. Let the
young Ladies be aſſured I make nothing new
in my Gardens without wiſhing to ſee the
print of their Fairy Steps in every part of

of this kind, in happily finiſhing the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Way and Grotto; I there found a
Spring of the cleareſt Water, which falls
in a perpetual Rill, that ecchoes thro' the
Cavern day and night. From the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Thames,</hi> you ſee thro' my Arch up a
Walk of the Wilderneſs to a kind of open
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0093401002:189"/>
Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the
Ruſtic Manner; and from that diſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Temple you look down thro' a ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arcade of Trees, and ſee the Sails on the
River paſſing ſuddenly and vaniſhing, as
thro' a Perſpective Glaſs. When you ſhut
the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the
inſtant, from a luminous Room, a <hi>Camera
obſcura</hi>; on the Walls of which all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats,
are forming a moving Picture in their viſible
Radiations: And when you have a mind to
light it up, it affords you a very different Scene:
It is finiſhed with ſhells interſperſed with
Pieces of Looking-glaſs in angular forms;
and in the Cieling is a Star of the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
at which when a Lamp (of an orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Figure of thin Alabaſter) is hung in the
Middle, a thouſand pointed Rays glitter and
are reflected over the Place. There are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
to this Grotto by a narrower Paſſage
two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one
toward the River, of ſmooth Stones, full of
light and open; the other toward the Arch
of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints and Iron
Ore. The Bottom is paved with ſimple
Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
to the Temple, is to be Cockle-ſhells,
in the natural Taſte, agreeing not ill with
the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic
Idea of the whole Place. It wants nothing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0093401002:190"/>
to compleat it but a good Statue with an

               <p>I Should be aſham'd to own the receipt of
a very kind Letter from you, two whole
Months from the date of this; if I were not
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0093401002:191"/>
more aſham'd to tell a Lye, or to make an
Excuſe, which is worſe than a Lye (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
built upon ſome probable Circumſtances,
it makes uſe of a degree of Truth to falſify
with: It is a Lye <hi>Guarded.</hi>) Your Letter
has been in my Pocket in conſtant wearing,
till that, and the Pocket, and the Suit, are
worn out; by which means, I have read it
forty times, and I find by ſo doing, that I
have not enough conſider'd, and reflected
upon many others you have obliged me
with; for true Friendſhip, as they ſay of good
Writing, will bear reviewing a thouſand
times, and ſtill diſcover new beauties.</p>
               <p>I have had a Fever, a ſhort one, but a
violent: I am now well. So it ſhall take up
no more of this Paper.</p>
               <p>I begin now to expect you in Town,
to make the Winter to come more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us both. The Summer is a kind of
Heaven, when we wander in a Paradiſaical
Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens:
but at this Seaſon, we are like our poor firſt
Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
life, and forc'd to look about for more
people to help to bear our labours, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
warmer Houſes, and hive together in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>I hope you are long ſince perfectly reſtor'd,
and riſen from your Gout, happy in the
delights of a contented Family, ſmiling at
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0093401002:192"/>
Storms, laughing at Greatneſs, and merry
over a Chriſtmas-fire, exerciſing all the
Functions of an old Patriarch in Charity and
Hoſpitality. I will not tell Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> what I
think ſhe is doing; for I conclude it is her
opinion, that he only ought to know it for
whom it is done: and ſhe will allow herſelf
to be far enough advanc'd above a fine Lady,
not to deſire to ſhine before Men.</p>
               <p>Your Daughters perhaps may have ſome
other thoughts, which even their Mother
muſt excuſe them for, becauſe ſhe is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I will not however ſuppoſe thoſe
thoughts get the better of their Devotions,
but rather excite 'em, and aſſiſt the warmth
of them; while their Prayer may be, that
they may raiſe up and breed as irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a young Family as their Parents have
done. In a Word, I fancy you all well,
eaſy, and happy, juſt as I wiſh you; and
next to that I wiſh you all with me.</p>
               <p>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in
dignity, and next in value. <hi>Minuiſti eum
paullo minus ab Angelis.</hi> If therefore I wiſh
well to the good and the deſerving, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
They only ſhould be my companions
and Correſpondents; I muſt very ſoon, and
very much think of you. I want your
Company, and your Example. Pray make
haſte to Town, ſo as not again to leave us:
Diſcharge the Load of Earth that lies on you,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0093401002:193"/>
like one of the Mountains under which the
Poets ſay the Giants (that is, the <hi>Men of the
Earth</hi>) are whelmed: Leave Earth to the
Sons of Earth; your Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Which that it may be accompliſh'd in
us all, is the Prayer of him who maketh this
ſhort Sermon, Value (to you) Three Pence.

               <p>YOU writ me a very kind Letter ſome
months ago, and told me you were
then upon the point of taking a journey
into <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> That hindered my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
you, and I have ſince ſeveral times
inquir'd of you, without any Satisfaction;
for ſo I call the knowledge of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
or of any thing that concerns you. I
paſt two months in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and ſince my
Return have been again very ill. I writ
to <hi>Lintot</hi> in hopes of hearing of you, but
had no anſwer to that Point. Our Friend
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0093401002:196"/>
Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> too has been ſilent all this
year; I believe he has been diſpleas'd at
ſome or other of my Freedoms; which I
very innocently take, and moſt with thoſe
I think moſt my friends. But this I know
nothing of, perhaps he may have open'd to
you: And, if I know you right, you are
of a Temper to cement Friendſhips, and
not to divide them. I really much love Mr.
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and have a true affection for your
ſelf, which if I had any Intereſt in the
world, or Power with thoſe who have, I
ſhould not be long without manifeſting to
you. I deſire you will not, either out of
Modeſty, or a vicious Diſtruſt of another's
value for you, (thoſe two Eternal Foes to
Merit) imagine that your Letters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
are not always welcome to me.
There's no Man more intirely fond of good-nature

               <p>IT has been my good fortune within
this Month paſt to hear more things
that have pleas'd me than (I think) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in all my time beſide. But nothing

as the News you tell me of your
ſelf: and you are not in the leaſt miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when you congratulate me upon your

Inconveniencies and Diſadvantages they
commonly talk of in the <hi>Res anguſti domi,</hi>
I have never found any other, than the
inability of giving people of Merit the only
certain proof of our value for them, in
doing 'em ſome real ſervice. For after

you are now Secretary to this Lady, that
you are likewiſe Secretary to Nine other

               <p>JUST as I receiv'd yours, I was ſet

ſhame that I had ſo long defer'd it. But
I can hardly repent my neglect, when it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0093401002:199"/>
gives me the knowledge how little you
inſiſt upon Ceremony, and how much a
greater ſhare in your memory I have than
I deſerve. I have been near a week in
<hi>London,</hi> where I am like to remain, till
I become by Mr. <hi>J<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s</hi>'s help, <hi>Elegans For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum
Spectator.</hi> I begin to diſcover Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that were till now imperceptible to
me. Every Corner of an Eye, or Turn
of a Noſe or Ear, the ſmalleſt degree of
Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
have charms to diſtract me. I no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
look upon Lord <hi>Plauſible</hi> as ridiculous,
for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear
and pretty Elbow (as the <hi>Plain-dealer</hi> has
it) but am in ſome danger even from the
Ugly and Diſagreeable, ſince they may have
their retired beauties, in one Trait or other
about 'em. You may gueſs in how uneaſy
a ſtate I am, when every day the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of others appear more beautiful
and excellent, and my own more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I have thrown away three Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>'s,
each of which was once my Vanity, two
Lady <hi>Bridgewaters,</hi> a Dutcheſs of <hi>Montague,</hi>
beſides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight
of the Garter. I have crucify'd <hi>Chriſt</hi>
over-again in effigie, and made a <hi>Madona</hi>
as old as her mother <hi>St. Anne.</hi> Nay, what
is yet more miraculous, I have rival'd
St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf in Painting, and as 'tis ſaid
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0093401002:200"/>
an Angel came and finiſh'd his Piece, ſo
you would ſwear a Devil put the laſt hand
to mine, 'tis ſo begrim'd and ſmut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
However I comfort my ſelf with
a chriſtian Reflection, that, I have not
broken the Commandment, for my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are not the likeneſs of any thing
in heaven above, or in earth below, or in
the waters under the earth. Neither will
any body adore or worſhip them, except
the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould have a fight of 'em,
who they tell us, worſhip cetain Pagods or
Idols purely for their Uglineſs.</p>
               <p>I am very much recreated and refreſhed
with the News of the Advancement of the
<hi>Fan,</hi> which I doubt not will delight the
Eye and Senſe of the Fair, as long as that
agreeable Machine ſhall play in the Hands
of Poſterity. I am glad your <hi>Fan</hi> is mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo ſoon, but I would have you varniſh
and glaze it at your leiſure, and poliſh the
Sticks as much as you can. You may then
cauſe it to be born in the Lands of both
Sexes, no leſs in <hi>Britain,</hi> than it is in <hi>China</hi>;
where it is ordinary for a <hi>Mandarine</hi> to fan

proceed from nothing but your Gratitude
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0093401002:206"/>
to a few people who endeavovr'd to ſerve
you, and whoſe Politicks were never your
Concern. If you are a <hi>Whig,</hi> as I rather
hope, and as I think your Principles and
mine (as Brother Poets) had ever a Byaſs to
the Side of Liberty, I know you will be an
honeſt man and an inoffenſive one. Upon
the whole, I know you are incapable of
being ſo much of either Party as to be good
for nothing. Therefore once more, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

all hail!</p>
               <p>One or two of your old Friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
they had heard nothing from you
ſince the <hi>Queen</hi>'s death; I told 'em, no
man living loved Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> better than I,
yet I had not once written to him in all
his Voyage. This I thought a convincing
proof, how truly one may be a friend to
another without telling him ſo every month.
But they had reaſons too themſelves to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in your excuſe, as men who really
value one another will never want ſuch
as make their friends and themſelves eaſy.
The late univerſal Concern in publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
threw us all into a hurry of Spirits;
even I who am more a Philoſopher than
to expect any thing from any Reign, was
born away with the current, and full of
the expectation of the Succeſſor: During
your Journeys I knew not whither to aim
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0093401002:207"/>
a letter after you, that was a ſort of ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flying: add to this the demand <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
had upon me, to write fifty Verſes
a day, beſides learned Notes, all which
are at a concluſion for this year. Rejoice
with me, O my Friend, that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is over; come and make merry with
me in much Feaſting, for I to thee and thou
to me. We will feed among the Lillies. By
the Lillies I mean the Ladies, with whom
I hope you have fed to ſatiety: Haſt thou
paſſed through many Countries, and not
taſted the delights thereof? Haſt thou not
left of thy Iſſue in divers Lands, that <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Gays</hi> and <hi>Dutch Gays</hi> may ariſe, to

of yours to Mr. <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> that you
have receiv'd one from me; and I beg
you to keep, as the greateſt of Curioſities,
that Letter of mine which you receiv'd and
I never writ.</p>
               <p>But the Truth is, that we were made
here to expect you in a ſhort time, that
I was upon the Ramble moſt part of the
Summer, and have concluded the Seaſon

I ſhall not enter into a detail of my
Concerns and Troubles, for two reaſons;
becauſe I am really afflicted and need no
Airs of grief, and becauſe they are not the
concerns and troubles of any but my ſelf.
But I think you (without too great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment)
enough my friend, to be pleas'd to
know he died eaſily, without a groan,. or
the ſickneſs of two minutes; in a word, as
ſilently and peacefully as he lived.<q>Sic mihi contingat vivere, ſicque mori!</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am not in the humour to ſay gay things,
nor in the affectation of avoiding them. I
can't pretend to entertain either Mr. <hi>Pulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
or you, as you have done both my Lord
<hi>Burlington</hi> and me, by your Letter to Mr.
<hi>Lowndes.</hi> I am only ſorry you have no
greater quarrel to Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> and wiſh
you paid ſome hundreds a year to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax.
That Gentleman is lately become an
inoffenſive perſon to me too; ſo that we
may join heartily in our addreſſes to him,
and (like true Patriots) rejoice in all that
Good done to the Nation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to which we contribute nothing our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not forget to acknowledge your
letter ſent from <hi>Aix</hi>; you told me then
that writing was not good with the Waters,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0093401002:210"/>
and I find ſince you are of my opinion, that
'tis as bad without the Waters. But I
fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that
is ſo bad with the Waters; and then you
might write without any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
if you writ like our Brother-poets
of theſe days.</p>
               <p>I have no ſtory to tell that is worth
your hearing; you know I am no man of
Intrigue; but the Dutcheſs of <hi>Hamilton</hi>
has one which ſhe ſays is worth my hearing,
that relates to Mr. <hi>Pulteney</hi> and your ſelf;
and which ſhe promiſes, if you won't tell

<hi>Pulteney,</hi> but that he is out of favour at
Court; and make ſome compliment to Mrs.
<hi>Pulteney,</hi> if ſhe were not a Whig. My Lord

               <p>I Think it obliging in you to deſire an
account of my health. The truth is,
I have never been in a worſe ſtate in
my life, and find whatever I have try'd
as a remedy ſo ineffectual, that I give myſelf
entirely over. I wiſh your health may be

I not only wiſh that, and every thing

with a Zeal not uſual among thoſe we call
ſo. I am always glad to hear of, and from
you; always glad to ſee you, whatever acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

you to all your acquaintance. I deſire you
to do the ſame for me to thoſe you are

if there are any, whom I have unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſerv'd ſo little of, as to be my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I don't deſire you to forfeit their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or your own judgment in any caſe.
Let Time convince thoſe who know me
not, that I am an inoffenſive perſon; tho'
(to ſay truth) I don't care how little I am
indebted to Time, for the World his hardly
worth living in, at leaſt to one that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

have been made to expect Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi>

do my beſt to forget my ſelf, but that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0093401002:213"/>
I find your Idea is cloſely connected to
me, that I muſt forget both together, or
neither. I'm ſorry, I could not have a
glympſe either of you, or of the Sun (your
Father) before you went to <hi>Bath.</hi> But now
it pleaſes me to ſee him, and hear of you.
Pray put Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> in mind that he has
one on this ſide of the World who loves
him; and that there are more Men and
Women in the Univerſe, than Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> and
my Lady Dutcheſs of <hi>M.</hi> There are Ladies
in and about <hi>Richmond</hi> that pretend to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
him and yourſelf; and one of 'em at
leaſt may be thought to do it without Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
namely Mrs. <hi>Howard.</hi> As for
Mrs. <hi>Blounts</hi> (whom you mercifully make
mention of) they are gone, or going to
<hi>Suſſex.</hi> I hope Mrs. <hi>Pulteney</hi> is the better
for the <hi>Bath,</hi> tho' I have little Charity and
few good Wiſhes for the Ladies, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers
of their beſt friends the Men. Pray
tell her ſhe has forgot the firſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
I ever troubled her with, and therefore
it ſhall be the laſt (the very thing I fear
ſhe deſires.) Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> is a ſtrange
creature; he goes out of town, and leaves
his Baſtards at other folks doors. I have
long been ſo far miſtaken in him as to think
him a Man of Morals as well as of Politicks.
Pray let him know I made a very unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
enquiry t'other day of the welfare
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0093401002:214"/>

pray dear <hi>Gay</hi> conſult with him and Dr.
<hi>Chene,</hi> to what exact pitch yours may be
ſuffer'd to ſwell, not to outgrow theirs,
who are, yet, your Betters. Pray tell Dr.
<hi>Arbuthnot</hi> that even Pigeon-pyes and Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puddings
are thought dangerous by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors;
for thoſe which have been ſent to
the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> are open'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
pry'd into at the <hi>Tower:</hi> 'Tis the

you, and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> (nay and the Doctor
if he has not dined) will be ſenſible of my
concern and ſurprize at the commitment of
that Gentleman, whoſe welfare is as much
my concern as any Friend's I have. I think
my ſelf a moſt unfortunate wretch: I no
ſooner love, and, upon knowledge fix my
eſteem to any man; but he either dies
like Mr. <hi>Craggs,</hi> or is ſent to Impriſonment
like the Biſhop. God ſend him as well as
I wiſh him, manifeſt him to be as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

Enemies know him as well as I do, that

they may love him and think of him as

unfortunate as to bury my poor Mother,

               <p>I AM glad to hear of the progreſs of
your recovery, and the oftner I hear it
the better, when it becomes eaſy to you to

at this time not to be able to be with you,
or you able to be with me. Had I loſt her,
I wou'd have been no where elſe but with
you during your confinement. I have now
paſt five weeks without once going from
home, and without any company but for
three or four of the days. Friends rarely
ſtretch their kindneſs ſo far as ten miles.
My Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> have
not forgotten to viſit me: the reſt (except
Mrs. <hi>Blount</hi> once) were contented to ſend

You are happily rid of many curſed cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,

               <p>IF my friendſhip were as effectual as it is
ſincere, you would be one of thoſe
people who would be vaſtly advantag'd and
enrich'd by it. I ever honour'd thoſe Popes
who were moſt famous for Nepotiſm, 'tis
a ſign that the old fellows <hi>loved ſomebody,</hi>
which is not uſual in ſuch advanced years.
And I now honour Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> for
his extenſive Bounty and Goodneſs to his
private Friends and Relations. But it vexes
me to the heart when I reflect, that my
friendſhip is ſo much leſs effectual than
theirs; nay ſo utterly uſeleſs that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give you any thing, not even a Dinner,
at this diſtance, nor help the General whom
I greatly love, to catch one fiſh. My on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſolation is to think you happier than
myſelf, and to begin to envy you, which
is next to hating (and excellent remedy for
Love.) How comes it that Providence has
been ſo unkind to me, (who am a greater
object of compaſſion than any fat man alive)
that I am forc'd to drink wine, while you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0093401002:227"/>
riot in water, prepar'd with oranges by the

ſprinkled with Roſe-water, and live in Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Balm and Burnet up to the chin,

while you are happily baniſh'd with the

even her Grace. After this I muſt not

I ſuppoſe to prevent or excuſe her not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

withdrawing from the World, but
meaning it mighty well, and reſolving to
ſhine whenever I can again. But I fear
the Clouds of a long Winter will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
me to ſuch a degree, that any body
will take a farthing candle for a better
Guide, and more ſerviceable Companion.
My Friends may remember my brighter
days, but will think (like the <hi>Iriſhman</hi>) that
the <hi>Moon</hi> is a better thing when once I am
gone. I don't ſay this with an alluſion to
my Poetical Capacity as a Son of <hi>Apollo</hi>;
but in my Companionable one, (if you'll
ſuffer me to uſe a phraſe of the Earl of
<hi>Clarendon</hi>'s:) For I ſhall ſee or be ſeen of
few of you, this Winter. I am grown too
faint to do any good, or to give any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
I not only, as <hi>Dryden</hi> fairly ſays,
<hi>Feel my notes decay</hi> as a Poet, but feel my
Spirits flag as a Companion, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again to where I firſt began, my
Books. I have been putting my Library
in order, and enlarging the Chimney in it,
with equal intention to warm my Mind
and Body (if I can) to ſome Life. A Friend,

(a Woman-friend, God help me!) with
whom I have ſpent three or four hours a day
theſe fifteen Years, adviſed me to paſs more
time in my ſtudies: I reflected, ſhe muſt
have found ſome Reaſon for this admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and concluded ſhe wou'd compleat all
her kindneſſes to me by returning me to
the Employment I am fitteſt for; Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with the dead, the old, and the
worm-eaten.</p>
               <p>Judge therefore if I might not treat
you as a Beatify'd Spirit, comparing your
life with my ſtupid ſtate. For as to my
living at <hi>Windſor</hi> with Ladies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is all
a dream; I was there but two nights, and
all the day out of that company. I ſhall
certainly make as little Court to others, as
they do to me; and that will be none at
all. My Fair-Weather Friends of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
are going away for <hi>London,</hi> and I ſhall
ſee Them and the Butterflies together, if
I live till next Year; which I would not
deſire to do, if it were only for their ſakes.
But we that are Writers, ought to love Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
that Poſterity may love us; and I
would willingly live to ſee the Children of
the preſent Race, meerly in hope they may
be a little wiſer than their Parents.</p>

               <p>I AM aſtoniſhed at the Complaints occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by a late <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Burlington</hi>; and I ſhould be afflicted were
there the leaſt juſt Ground for 'em. Had
the Writer attack'd <hi>Vice,</hi> at a Time when
it is not only tolerated but triumphant,
and ſo far from being conceal'd as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
that it is proclaimed with Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as a <hi>Merit</hi>; I ſhould have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of the Conſequence: Had he
ſatirized Gameſters of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds Fortune, acquired by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
as are in daily practice, and almoſt
univerſally encouraged: Had he overwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defended the <hi>Religion of his Country,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch Books as come from every Preſs,
are publickly vended in every Shop, and
greedily bought by almoſt every Rank of
Men; or had he called our excellent <hi>Weekly
Writings</hi> by the ſame Names which they
openly beſtow on the greateſt Men <hi>in</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and <hi>out</hi> of the Miniſtry, for which
they are all unpuniſhed, and moſt rewarded:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0093401002:234"/>
In any of theſe Caſes, indeed, I might have
judged him too preſumptious, and perhaps
have trembled for his Raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>I could not but hope better for this ſmall
and modeſt Epiſtle, which attacks <hi>no one
Vice</hi> whatſoever; which deals only in <hi>Folly</hi>
and not Folly in general, but a ſingle Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of it; that only Branch, for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Excellency to which, the noble Lord to
whom it is written muſt neceſſarily be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.
I fancied it might eſcape Cenſure,
eſpecially ſeeing how tenderly theſe Follies
are treated, and really leſs accuſed, than
Apologized for.<q>
                     <l>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</l>
                     <l>Health to himſelf, and to his Infants Bread</l>
                     <l>The Lab'rer bears.</l>
                  </q> Is this ſuch a <hi>Crime,</hi> that to impute it to a
Man muſt be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an
<hi>Innocent Folly,</hi> and much more <hi>Beneficent</hi>
than the want of it; for <hi>Ill Taſte</hi> employs
more hands, and diffuſes Expence more
than a <hi>Good</hi> one. Is it a <hi>Moral</hi> Defect? No,
it is but a <hi>Natural</hi> one; a <hi>Want of Taſte.</hi>
It is what the beſt good Man living may be
liable to: The worthieſt Peer may live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
in an ill-favour'd Houſe, and the
beſt reputed Citizen be pleaſed with a vile
Garden. I thought (I ſay) the Author had
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0093401002:235"/>
the common Liberty to obſerve a Defect,
and to compliment a Friend for a Quality
that diſtinguiſhes him: which I know not
how any Quality ſhould do, if we were not
to remark that it was wanting in others.</p>
               <p>But they ſay the Satire is <hi>Perſonal.</hi> I
thought it could not be ſo, becauſe all its
Reflections are on <hi>Things.</hi> His Reflections
are not on the <hi>Man,</hi> but his Houſe, Garden,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, he reflects (as one may ſay) the
<hi>Perſons</hi> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the
Nile, and the Triton: He is only ſorry to
ſee them (as he might be to ſee any of his
<hi>Friends</hi>) ridiculous, by being in the wrong
Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy,
that to ſay a thing is <hi>Perſonal,</hi> is the ſame as
to ſay it is <hi>Injuſt,</hi> not conſidering that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be <hi>Juſt</hi> that is not <hi>Perſonal.</hi> I
am afraid that <q rend="inline">"all ſuch Writings and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
as <hi>touch no Man,</hi> will <hi>mend no
Man.</hi>"</q> The Good Natured, indeed, are
apt to be alarmed at any thing like Satire; and
the <hi>Guilty</hi> readily concur with the <hi>Weak</hi> for
a plain Reaſon, becauſe the Vicious look
upon Folly as their <hi>Frontier:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Jam ſtroximus ardet</l>
                     <l>Ucalegon—</l>
                  </q>
No wonder thoſe who know Ridicule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them, find an inward Conſolation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0093401002:236"/>
in removing it from themſelves as far as they
can; and it is never ſo far, as when they
can get it fixed on the <hi>beſt Characters.</hi> No
wonder thoſe who are Food for Satiriſts
ſhould rail at them as Creatures of Prey;
every Beaſt born for our Uſe would be ready
to call a Man ſo.</p>
               <p>I know no Remedy, unleſs people in our
Age would as little frequent the Theatres,
as they begin to do the Churches; unleſs
Comedy were forſaken, Satire ſilent, and
every man left to do what ſeems good in his
own Eyes, as if there were no King, no
Prieſt, no Poet in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I find myſelf obliged to touch a
Point, on which I muſt be more ſerious; it
well deſerves I ſhould: I mean the malicious
Application of the Character of <hi>Timon,</hi> which
I will boldly ſay, they would impute to the
Perſon the moſt different in the World from
a <hi>Man-hater,</hi> and the Perſon whoſe <hi>Taſte</hi>
and <hi>Encouragement</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> have often been
ſhewn in the <hi>righteſt Place.</hi> The Author
of that Epiſtle muſt certainly think ſo, if
he has the ſame Opinion of his own Merit
as Authors generally have; for he has been
favoured by this very Perſon.</p>
               <p>Why, in God's Name, muſt a <hi>Portrait,</hi>
apparently collected from twenty different
Men, be apply'd to one only? Has it his
<hi>Eye?</hi> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <hi>Noſe</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0093401002:237"/>
or <hi>Mouth?</hi> No, they are totally differing.
What then, I beſeech you? Why, it has the
<hi>Mole on his Chin.</hi> Very well; but muſt the
Picture thereof be his, and has no other
man that blemiſh?</p>
               <p>Could there be a more melancholy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
how much the Taſte of the Publick is
vitiated, and turns the moſt ſalutary and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Phyſick into Poiſon, than if amidſt
the Blaze of thouſand bright Qualities in a
Great Man, they ſhould only remark there is
a <hi>Shadow</hi> about him, as what Eminence is
without? I am confident the Author was
incapable of imputing any ſuch to One,
whoſe whole Life (to uſe his own Expreſſion
in Print of him) is <hi>a continued Series</hi> of good
and generous Actions.</p>
               <p>I know no man who would be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
if he gave the leaſt Pain or Offence
to any innocent Perſon; and none who
would be leſs concerned, if the Satire were
challenged by any one at whom he would
really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare
engage he will own it, with all the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of one whoſe <hi>Cenſures</hi> are <hi>juſt,</hi> and who
ſets his <hi>Name</hi> to them.</p>

               <p>THE Clamour rais'd about my Epiſtle
to you, could not give me ſo much
pain, as I receiv'd pleaſure in ſeeing the
general Zeal of the world in the cauſe of a
great Man who is Beneficient, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Warmth of your Lordſhip in that
of a private Man who is innocent.</p>
               <p>It was not the <hi>Poem</hi> that deſerv'd this
from you; for as I had the Honour to be
your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like
a Poet: But ſure the <hi>Writer</hi> deſerv'd more
Candor, even from thoſe who knew him
not, than to promote a Report, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to that Noble Perſon was <hi>Impertinent</hi>;
in regard to me, <hi>Villainous.</hi> Yet I had no
great Cauſe to wonder, that a Character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>twenty</hi> ſhou'd be applied to <hi>one</hi>;
ſince, by that means <hi>nineteen</hi> wou'd eſcape
the Ridicule.</p>
               <p>I was too well content with my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that Noble Perſon's Opinion in this
Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0093401002:239"/>
ſince Malice and Miſtake are ſo long a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I have taken the opportunity of a third
Edition to declare <hi>His Belief,</hi> not only of <hi>My
Innocence,</hi> but of <hi>Their Malignity,</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which my own Heart is as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as I fear ſome of theirs muſt of the
latter. His Humanity feels a Concern for
the Injury done to <hi>Me,</hi> while His Greatneſs
of Mind can bear with Indifference the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
offer'd to <hi>Himſelf.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>However, my Lord, I own, that Critics of
<hi>this Sort</hi> can intimidate me, nay half incline
me to write no more: That wou'd be making
the Town a Compliment which I think it
deſerves; and which ſome, I am ſure, wou'd
take very kindly. This way of Satire is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as long as Slander rais'd by Fools of
the loweſt Rank can find any countenance
from thoſe of a Higher. Even from the
Conduct ſhewn on this Occaſion, I have
learnt there are ſome who wou'd rather be
<hi>wicked</hi> than <hi>ridiculous</hi>; and therefore it
may be ſafer to attack <hi>Vices</hi> than <hi>Follies.</hi>
I will therefore leave my Betters in the

Subject from their <hi>Pride</hi> to their <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

And as the only certain way to avoid Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions,

               <p>I Little doubt of your kind Concern for
me, nor of that of the Lady you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I have nothing to repay my Friends
with at preſent, but prayers and good
wiſhes. I have the ſatisfaction to find that
I am as officiouſly ſerv'd by my Friends, as
he that has thouſands to leave in Legacies;
beſides the Aſſurance of their Sincerity.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0093401002:241"/>
God Almighty has made my bodily diſtreſs
as eaſy as a thing of that nature can be:
I have found ſome relief, at leaſt ſometimes,
from the Air of this Place. My Nights are
bad, but many poor Creatures have worſe.</p>
               <p>As for you, my good Friend, I think ſince
our firſt acquaintance there has not been
any of thoſe little Suſpicions or Jealouſies
that often affect the ſincereſt Friendſhips;
I am ſure not on my ſide. I muſt be ſo
ſincere as to own, that tho' I could not help
valuing you for thoſe Talents which the
World prizes, yet they were not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of my Friendſhip: They were quite
of another ſort; nor ſhall I at preſent offend
you by enumerating them: And I make it
my laſt Requeſt, that you continue that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Diſdain</hi> and <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of Vice, which
you ſeem naturally endu'd with, but ſtill
with a due regard to your own ſafety; and
ſtudy more to reform than chaſtiſe, tho'
the one often cannot be effected without the
other.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi> I have always honour'd for
every good Quality, that a Perſon of his
Rank ought to have: Pray give my Reſpects
and kindeſt Wiſhes to the Family. My Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon
Stomach is gone, but I have thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me, and often with me, who will
be very glad of his Preſent. If it is left
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0093401002:242"/>
at my Houſe it will be tranſmitted ſafe to

               <p>A Recovery in my Caſe, and at my Age,
is impoſſible; the kindeſt Wiſh of my
