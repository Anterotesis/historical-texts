            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Mrs. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Vindication of the indiſpenſable Duty of Cuckol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, incumbent upon Wives, in caſe of the Tyranny, Infidelity, or Inſufficiency of Husbands: Being a full Anſwer to the Doctor's Sermon againſt <hi>Adultery.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>JOHN found daily freſh Proofs of the Infidelity and bad Deſigns of his deceas'd Wife; amongſt other Things, one Day looking over his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, he found the following Paper.</p>
            <q>
               <p>IT is evident that Matrimony is founded upon an original Contract, whereby the Wife makes over the Right ſhe has by the Law of Nature to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubitus vagus,</hi> in favour of the Husband, by which he acquires the Property of all her Poſterity; but then the Obligation is mutual: And where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is broken on one ſide, it ceaſes to bind on the other; where there is a Right, there muſt be a Power to maintain it, and to puniſh the offending Party. This Power I affirm to be that Original Right, or rather that indiſpenſable Duty of Cuckoldom, lodg'd in all Wives, in the Caſes above-mention'd. No Wife is bound by any Law to which ſhe her ſelf has not conſented: All Oeconomical Government is lodg'd originally in the Husband and Wife, the executive part being in the Husband, both have their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges ſecur'd to them by Law and Reaſon; but will any Man infer from the Husband's being inveſted with the executive Power, that the Wife is depriv'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0147501900:5"/>
of her Share, and that which is the principal Branch of it, the original Right of Cuckoldom? and that ſhe has no remedy left but <hi>Preces &amp; Lacrymae,</hi> or an Appeal to a ſupreme Court of Judicature? No leſs frivolous are the Arguments that are drawn, from the general Appellations and Terms of Husband and Wife; a Husband denotes ſeveral different ſorts of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, according to the Uſages and Cuſtoms of different Climates and Countries; in ſome Eaſtern Nations it ſignifies a Tyrant, with the abſolute Power of Life and Death. In <hi>Turkey</hi> it denotes an Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, with power of perpetual Impriſonment; in <hi>Italy</hi> it gives the Husband the power of Poiſon and Padlocks; in the Countries of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> it has quite a different Meaning, implying a free and equal Government, ſecuring to the Wife, in certain Caſes, the liberty of Cuckoldom, and the property of Pin-money and ſeparate Maintenance; ſo that the Arguments drawn from the terms of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife are fallacious, and by no means fit to ſupport a tyrannical Doctrine, as that of abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Chaſtity, and conjugal Fidelity.</p>
               <p>The general Exhortations to Chaſtity in Wives, are meant only for Rules in ordinary Caſes, but they naturally ſuppoſe the three Conditions of Ability, Juſtice and Fidelity, in the Husband; ſuch an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, uncondition'd Fidelity in the Wife could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſuppoſed by reaſonable Men; it ſeems a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon the Ch—ch, to charge her with Doctrines that countenance Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of the original Right of Cuckoldom is congruous to the Law of Nature, which is ſuperior to all human Laws, and for that I dare appeal to all Wives: It is much to the Honour of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wives, that they have never given up that <hi>fundamental Point;</hi> and that tho' in former Ages they were muffled up in Darkneſs and Superſtition, yet that Notion ſeem'd engraven on their Minds, and the Impreſſion ſo ſtrong, that nothing could impair it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0147501900:6"/>
To aſſert the Illegality of Cuckoldom, upon any Pretence whatſoever, were to caſt odious Colours upon the married State, to blacken the neceſſary Means of perpetuating Families: Such Laws can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſuppos'd to have been deſign'd to defeat the very end of Matrimony, the Propagation of Mankind. I call them neceſſary Means, for in many Caſes what other Means are left? Such a Doctrine wounds the Honour of Families, unſettles the Titles to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Honours and Eſtates; for if the Actions from which ſuch Settlements ſpring were illegal, all that is built upon them muſt be ſo too; but the laſt is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, therefore the firſt muſt be ſo likewiſe. What is the Cauſe that <hi>Europe</hi> groans, at preſent, under the heavy Load of a cruel and expenſive War, but the tyrannical Cuſtom of a certain Nation, and the ſcrupulous Nicety of a ſilly Quean, in not exerciſing this indiſpenſable Duty of Cuckoldom, whereby the Kingdom might have had an Heir, and a controverted Succeſſion might have been avoided? Theſe are the Effects of the narrow Maxims of your Clergy, <hi>That one muſt not do Evil, that Good may come of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aſſertors of this indefeaſible Right, and <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Matrimony, do all in their Hearts favour Gallants, and the Pretenders to married Women; for if the true legal Foundation of the married State be once ſap'd, and inſtead thereof tyrannical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims introduc'd, what muſt follow but Elopements. inſtead of ſecret and peaceable Cuckoldom?</p>
               <p>From all that has been ſaid, one may clearly per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive the Abſurdity of the Doctrine of this ſeditious diſcontented, hot-headed, ungifted, unedifying Preacher, aſſerting, <hi>That the grand Security of the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trimonial State, and the Pillar upon which it ſtands, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

As for his perſonal Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I would gladly know who are thoſe <hi>Wanton Wives</hi> he ſpeaks of? who are thoſe Ladies of high Stations, that he ſo boldly traduces in his Sermon? It is pretty plain who theſe Aſperſions are aim'd at, for which he deſerves the Pillory, or ſomething worſe.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of this Doctrine of the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duty of Cuckoldom, I could deduce the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the wiſeſt Wives in all Ages, who by theſe means have preſerv'd their Husband's Families from Ruin and Oblivion, by want of Poſterity; but what has been ſaid, is a ſufficient Ground for puniſhing this pragmatical Parſon.</p>

A very fine Spark this Eſquire <hi>South!</hi> My Husband took him in, a dirty, ſnotty-nos'd Boy, it was the Buſineſs of half the Servants to attend him, the Rogue did bawl and make ſuch a noiſe: Sometimes he fell in the Fire and burnt his Face, ſometimes broke his Shins clambering over the Benches, often piſs'd a-Bed, and always came in ſo dirty, as if he had been dragg'd thro' the Kennel at a Boarding-School. He loſt his Money at Chuck-Farthing, Shuffle-Cap, and All-Fours; ſold his Books, pawn'd his Linnen, which we were always forc'd to redeem. Then the whole Generation of him are ſo in love with Bagpipes and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0147501900:9"/>
Poppet Shows; I wiſh you knew what my Husband has paid at the Paſtry Cooks and Confectioners, for <hi>Naples</hi> Biſcuit, Tarts, Cuſtards, and Sweet-Meats. All this while my Husband conſider'd him as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a good Family that had fallen into Decay, gave him good Education, and has ſettled him in a good Credible way of Living, having procur'd him, by his Intereſt, one of the beſt Places of the Country; and what return, think you, does this fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man make us? he will hardly give me or my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a good Word, or a civil Expreſſion: Inſtead of plain Sir and Madam (which, tho' I ſay it, is our doe) he calls us <hi>Goody</hi> and <hi>Gaffer</hi> ſuch a one, that he did us a great deal Honour to Board with us; huffs and dings at ſuch a rate, becauſe we will not ſpend the little we have left to get him the Title and Eſtate of Lord <hi>Strutt;</hi> and then, forſooth, we ſhall have the Honour to be his Woollen-drapers.</p>

               <p>Look you, Friend <hi>Diego,</hi> if we Law it on till <hi>Lewis</hi> turns honeſt, I am afraid our Credit will run low at <hi>Blackwell-Hall;</hi> I wiſh every Man had his own; but I ſtill ſay, that Lord <hi>Strutt</hi>'s Money ſhines as bright, and chinks as well as Eſquire <hi>South</hi>'s. I don't know any other Hold that we Tradeſmen have of theſe great Folks, but their Intereſt; buy dear, and ſell cheap, and I'll warrant ye you will keep your Cuſtomer. The worſt is, that Lord <hi>Strutt</hi>'s Servants have got ſuch a haunt about that old Rogue's Shop, that it will coſt us many a Firkin of ſtrong Beer to bring them back again, and the longer they are in a bad Road, the harder it will be to get them out of it.</p>

               <p>I think I need not tell you how much <hi>Frog</hi> has been oblig'd to our Family from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; he carries his Head high now, but he had never been the Man he is, without our Help. Ever ſince the Commencement of this Law-Suit it has been the Buſineſs of <hi>Hocus,</hi> in ſharing our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, to plead for <hi>Frog. Poor</hi> Frog, (ſays he) <hi>is in hard Circumſtances, he has a numerous Family, and lives from Hand to Mouth; his Children don't eat a bit of good Victuals from one Year's end to the other, but live upon Salt Herring, ſowr Crud, and Bore-cole; he does his utmoſt, poor Fellow, to keep things even in the World, and has exerted himſelf beyond his Ability in this Law-Suit, but he really has not where-withal to go on. What ſignifies this Hundred Pounds, place it upon your ſide of the Account; it is a great deal to poor</hi> Frog, <hi>and a Trifle to you.</hi> This has been <hi>Hocus</hi>'s conſtant Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and I am ſure he has had Obligations enough to us to have acted another Part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No doubt <hi>Hocus</hi> meant all this for the beſt, but he is a tender-hearted charitable Men; <hi>Frog</hi> is indeed in hard Circumſtances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Bull.</speaker>
               <p>Hard Circumſtances! I ſwear this is provoking to the laſt degree. All the time of the Law-Suit, as faſt as I have Mortgaged, <hi>Frog</hi> has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd: From a plain Tradeſman, with a Shop, Warehouſe, and a Country-Hutt, with a dirty Fiſh-Pond at the end of it, he is now grown a very rich Country Gentleman, with a noble-landed Eſtate, noble Palaces, Manors, Parks, Gardens and Farms, finer than any we were ever Maſter of. Is it not ſtrange, when my Husband disburs'd great Sums every Term, <hi>Frog</hi> ſhould be purchaſing ſome new Farm or Manor? So that if this Law-Suit laſts, he will be far the richeſt Man in his Country. What is worſe than all this, he ſteals away my Cuſtomers every Day; I have Twelve of the richeſt, and the beſt, that have left my Shop by his Perſwaſion, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0147501900:11"/>
whom, to my certain Knowledge, he has under Bonds never to return again: Judge you if this be neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly Dealing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Frog</hi> is indeed pretty cloſe in his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but very honeſt: You are ſo touchy, and take things ſo hotly, I am ſure there muſt be ſome Miſtake in this.</p>

               <p>A plaguy one indeed! You know, and have often told me of it, how <hi>Hocus</hi> and thoſe Rogues kept my Husband, <hi>John Bull,</hi> drunk for five Years together, with Punch and Strong Waters; I am ſure he never went one Night ſober to Bed, till they got him to ſign the ſtrangeſt Deed that ever you ſaw in your Life.

            <head>CHAP. IV. How the Guardians of the deceas'd Mrs. <hi>Bull</hi>'s three Daughters came to <hi>John,</hi> and what Advice they gave him; wherein is briefly treated the Characters of the three Daughters: Alſo <hi>John Bull</hi>'s Anſwer to the three Guardians.</head>
            <p>I Told you in my firſt Part, that Mrs. <hi>Bull,</hi> before ſhe departed this Life, had bleſs'd <hi>John</hi> with three Daughters; I need not here repeat their Names, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0147501900:15"/>
would I willingly uſe any ſcandalous Reflections upon young Ladies, whoſe Reputations ought to be very tenderly handled; but the Characters of theſe were ſo well known in the Neighbourhood, that it is doing them no Injury to make a ſhort Deſcription of them.</p>
            <p>The Eldeſt was a termagant, imperious, prodigal. lewd, profligate Wench, as ever breath'd; ſhe uſed to Rantipole about the Houſe, pinch the Children, kick the Servants, and torture the Cats and the Dogs; ſhe would rob her Father's ſtrong Box, for Money to give the young Fellows that ſhe was fond of: She had a noble Air, and ſomething great in her Mein, but ſuch a noiſome infectious Breath, as threw all the Servants that dreſs'd her into Conſumptions; if ſhe ſmelt to the freſheſt Noſegay, it would ſhrivel and wither as it had been blighted: She us'd to come home in her Cups, and break the <hi>China,</hi> and the Looking-glaſſes, and was of ſuch an irregular Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſo entirely given up to her Paſſion, that you might argue as well with the Northwind, as with her Ladyſhip; ſo Expenſive, that the Income of three Dukedoms was not enough to ſupply her Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. <hi>Hocus</hi> lov'd her beſt, believing her to be his own, got upon the Body of Mrs. <hi>Bull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Daughter, born a Year after her Siſter, was a peeviſh, froward, ill-condition'd Creature as ever was born, ugly as the Devil, lean, haggard, pale, with ſaucer Eyes, a ſharp Noſe and hunch-back'd, but active, ſprightly and diligent about her Affairs. Her Ill-Complexion was occaſion'd by her bad Diet, which was Coffee, Morning, Noon and Night. She never reſted quietly a Bed, but uſed to diſturb the whole Family with ſhrieking out in her Dreams, and plague them next Day with interpreting them, for ſhe took them all for Goſpel. She would cry out Murder, and diſturb the whole Neighbourhood; and when <hi>John</hi> came running down Stairs to enquire
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0147501900:16"/>
what the Matter was, nothing forſooth, only her Maid had ſtuck a Pin wrong in her Gown. She turn'd away one Servant for putting too much Oil in her Sallad, and another for putting too little Salt in her Water-Cruel. But ſuch as by Flattery had procur'd her Eſteem, ſhe would indulge in the greateſt Crimes. Her Father had two Coachmen, when one was in the Coach-box, if the Coach ſwung but the leaſt to one ſide, ſhe uſed to ſhriek ſo loud, that all the Street concluded ſhe was overturn'd; but tho' the other was eternally Drunk, and had overturn'd the whole Family, ſhe was very angry with her Father for turning him away. Then ſhe uſed to carry Tales and Stories from one to another, till ſhe had ſet the whole Neighbourhood together by the Ears; and this was the only Diverſion ſhe took pleaſure in. She never went abroad, but ſhe brought home ſuch a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of monſtrous Lyes as would have amaz'd any Mortal, but ſuch as knew her: Of a Whale that had ſwallow'd a Fleet of Ships; of the Lyons being let out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion; of the Pope's being ſeen in a Brandy Shop at <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> and a prodigious ſtrong Man that was going to ſhove down the <hi>Cupola</hi> of <hi>Paul's;</hi> of Three millions of Five Pound Pieces that Eſquire <hi>South</hi> had found under an old Wall; of Blazing-Stars, Flying Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and abundance of ſuch Stuff. All the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Family made high Court to her, for ſhe Domineer'd there, and turn'd out and in whom ſhe pleas'd; only there was an old Grudge between her and Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> whom ſhe mortally hated, and uſed to hire Fellows to ſquirt Kennel Water upon him as he paſs'd along the Streets, ſo that he was forc'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to wear a Surtout of oil'd Cloath, by which means he came home pretty clean, except where the Surtout was a little ſcanty.</p>
            <p>As for the Third, ſhe was a Thief, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercenary Proſtitute, and that without any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0147501900:17"/>
Solicitation from Nature, for ſhe own'd ſhe had no Enjoyment. She had no Reſpect of Perſons, a Prince or a Porter was all one, according as they paid; yea ſhe would leave the fineſt Gentleman in the World to go to an ugly pocky Fellow, for Six Pence more. In the practice of her Profeſſion ſhe had amaſs'd vaſt Magazines of all ſorts of Things; ſhe had above Five hundred Suits of fine Clothes, and yet went abroad like a Cynder-Wench: She robb'd and ſtarv'd all the Servants, ſo that no Body could live near her.</p>
            <p>So much for <hi>John</hi>'s three Daughters, which you will ſay were Rarities to be fond of. Yet Nature will ſhow it ſelf; no Body could blame their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for taking care of them, and therefore it was that <hi>Hocus,</hi> with two other of the Guardians, thought it their Duty to take care of the Intereſt of the three Girls, and give <hi>John</hi> their beſt Advice, before he Compounded the Law-Suit.</p>

               <p>What makes you ſo ſhy of late, my good Friend? There's no Body loves you better than I, nor has taken more pains in your Affairs: As I hop'd to be ſav'd I would do any thing to ſerve you, I would crawl upon all Four to ſerve you; I have ſpent my Health, and paternal Eſtate in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; I have, indeed, a ſmall Pittance left, with which I might retire, and with as good a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as any Man. But the thoughts of this diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Compoſition ſo touches me to the Quick, that I cannot ſleep: After I had brought the Cauſe to the laſt Stroke, that one Verdict more had quite ruin'd old <hi>Lewis</hi> and Lord <hi>Strutt,</hi> and put you in the quiet Poſſeſſion of every thing; then to Compound, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it. This Cauſe was my Favourite, I had ſet my Heart upon it; it is like an only Child, I cannot endure it ſhould miſcarry: For God ſake conſider only to what a diſmal Condition old <hi>Lewis</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0147501900:18"/>
is brought: He is at an end of all his Caſh, his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys have hardly one Trick left, they are at an end of all their <hi>Chicane;</hi> beſides, he has both his Law and his daily Bread now upon Truſt: Hold out only one Term longer, and, I'll warrant you, before the next, we ſhall have him in the <hi>Fleet.</hi> I'll bring him to the Pillory, his Ears ſhall pay for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; for the Love of God don't Compound, let me be Damn'd if you have a Friend in the World that loves you better than I; there is no Body can ſay I am Covetous, or that I have any Intereſt to purſue but yours.</p>

               <p>There is nothing ſo plain, than that this <hi>Lewis</hi> has a deſign to Ruin all his neighbouring Tradeſmen, and at this time he has ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Income, by his Trade of all kinds, that if there is not ſome ſtop put to his Exorbitant Riches, he will Monopolize every thing, and no Body will be able to ſell a Yard of Drapery or Mercery Ware but himſelf. I therefore hold it adviſable, that you continue the Law-Suit, and burſt him at once. My Concern for the three poor Motherleſs Children ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to give you this Advice, for their Eſtates, poor Girls, depend upon the Succeſs of this Cauſe.</p>

               <p>I own this Writ of Ejectment has coſt dear, but then conſider it is a Jewel well worth the Purchaſing, at the Price of all you have. None but Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s declar'd Enemies can ſay he has any other Security for his Cloathing Trade, but the Ejectment of Lord <hi>Strutt.</hi> The only Queſtion then that remains to be decided, is, Who ſhall ſtand the: Expences of the Suit? To which the Anſwer is as plain, Who but he that is to have the Advantage of the Sentence? When Eſquire <hi>South</hi> has got Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Title and Honour, is not <hi>John Bull</hi> to be his Clothier? Who then but <hi>John</hi> ought to put him in Poſſeſſion? Ask but any indifferent Gentleman
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0147501900:19"/>
who ought to bear his Charges at Law? and he will readily anſwer, his Tradeſmen. I do therefore affirm, and I will go to Death with it, that, being his Clothier, you ought to put him in quiet Poſſeſſion of his Eſtate, and with the ſame generous Spirit you have begun it, compleat the good Work. If you perſiſt in the bad Meaſures you are now in, what muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the three poor Orphans? My Heart bleeds for the poor Girls.</p>

               <speaker>John Bull.</speaker>
               <p>You are all very eloquent Perſons, but give me leave to tell you, that you expreſs a great deal of more Concern for the three Girls than for me; I think my Intereſt ought to be conſider'd in the firſt place. As for you, <hi>Hocus,</hi> I can't but ſay you have managed my Law-Suit with great Addreſs, and much to my Honour; and, tho' I ſay it, you have been well paid for it; never was Attornies Bill more Extravagant, and, give me leave to ſay, there are many Articles which the moſt griping of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion never demanded. I have truſted you with the disburſing great Sums of Money, and you have conſtantly ſunk ſome into your own Pocket. I tell you I don't like that Sinking. Why muſt the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then be taken off <hi>Frog</hi>'s Back, and laid upon my Shoulders? He can drive about his own Parks and Fields in his gilt Chariot, when I have been forc'd to Mortgage my Eſtate! his Note will go farther than my Bond! Is it not Matter of Fact, that from the richeſt Tradeſman in all the Country, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beg and borrow from Scriveners and Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that ſuck the Heart, Blood and Guts out of me, and what was all this for? Did you like <hi>Frog</hi>'s Countenance better than mine? Was not I your old Friend and Relation? Have I not Preſented you nobly? Have I not clad your whole Family? Have you not had an Hundred Yards at a time, of the fineſt Cloath in my Shop? Why muſt the reſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0147501900:20"/>
of the Tradeſmen be not only indemnified from Charges, but forbid to go on with their own Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and what is more their Concern than mine? As to holding out this Term, I Appeal to your own Conſcience, has not that been your conſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe theſe Six Years, one <hi>Term more, and old</hi> Lewis <hi>goes to Pot;</hi> if thou art ſo fond of my Cauſe, be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous for once, and lend me a brace of Thouſands. Ah <hi>Hocus! Hocus!</hi> I know thee, not a Sous to ſave me from Goal, I trow. Look ye, Gentlemen, I have liv'd with Credit in the World, and it grieves my Heart, never to ſtir out of my Doors, but to be pull'd by the Sleeve by ſome Raſcally Dun, or another: <hi>Sir, Remember my Bill: There's a ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of a Thouſand Pounds, I hope you think on't, Sir.</hi> And to have theſe Uſurers tranſact my Debts at Coffee-Houſes and Ale-Houſes, as if I were going to break-up Shop. Lord! That ever the Rich, the Generous <hi>John Bull,</hi> Clothier, the Envy of all his Neighbours, ſhould be brought to Compound his Debts for Five Shillings in the Pound; and to have his Name in an Advertiſement, for a Statute of Bankrupt. The Thoughts of it makes me Mad. I have read ſome-where in the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> That one ſhould not <hi>conſult with a Woman touching her, of whom ſhe is Jealous; nor with a Merchant, concerning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, nor with a Buyer, of Selling; nor with an unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Man of Kindneſs,</hi> &amp;c. I could have added one thing more; <hi>Nor with an Attorney, about Compounding a Law-Suit.</hi> This Ejectment of Lord <hi>Strutt</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do. The Evidence is Crimp; the Witneſſes ſwear backwards and forwards, and Contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and his Tenants ſtick by him. If it were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, is it reaſonable, that when Eſquire <hi>South</hi> is loſing his Money to Sharpers and Pick-Pockets, going about the Country with Fidlers and Buffoons, and ſquandring his Income with Hawks and Dogs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0147501900:21"/>
I ſhould lay out the Fruits of my honeſt Induſtry in a Law-Suit for him, only upon the hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Clothier? and when the Cauſe is over, I ſhall not have the Benefit of my Project, for want of Money to go to Market. Look ye, Gentlemen, <hi>John Bull</hi> is but a plain Man; but <hi>John Bull</hi> knows when he is ill uſed. I know the Infirmity of our Family; we are apt to play the Boon-Companion, and throw away our Money in our Cups: But it was an unfair thing in you, Gentlemen, to take Advantage of my Weakneſs, to keep a parcel of roaring Bulleys about me, Day and Night, with Huzza's, and Hunting-Horns, and Ringing the Changes on Butchers Cleavers; never to let me cool, and make me ſet my Hands to Papers, when I could hardly hold my Pen. There will come a Day of Reckoning for all that Proceeding. In the mean time, Gentlemen, I beg you will let me into my Affairs a little, and that you would not grudge me very ſmall Remainder of a very great Eſtate.</p>

            <p>THE Arguments us'd by <hi>Hocus,</hi> and the reſt of the Guardians, had hitherto prov'd inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. <hi>John</hi> and his Wife could not be perſwaded to bear the Expence of Eſquire <hi>South</hi>'s Law-Suit. They thought it reaſonable, that ſince he was to have the Honour and Advantage, he would bear the greateſt Share of the Charges; and retrench what he loſt to Sharpers, and ſpent upon Country-Dances, and Puppet-Plays, to apply it to that uſe. This was not very grateful to the Eſquire: Therefore, as the laſt Experiment, he was reſolved to ſend Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior

               <hi>Benenato,</hi> Maſter of his Fox-Hounds, to Mrs. <hi>Bull,</hi> to try what good he could do with her. This Signior <hi>Benenato</hi> had all the Qualities of a fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that were fit to Charm a Lady's Heart; and if any Perſon in the World could have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, it was he: But ſuch was her unſhaken Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to her Husband, and the conſtant Purpoſe of her Mind to purſue his Intereſt, that the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Arts of Gallantry, that were practis'd, could not ſeduce her Loyal Heart. The Necklaces, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Croſſes, and rich Bracelets that were offer'd, ſhe rejected with the utmoſt Scorn and Diſdain. The Muſick and Serenades that were given her, ſounded more ungratefully in her Ears, than the Noiſe of a Screech Owl; however ſhe receiv'd Eſquire <hi>South</hi>'s Letter, by the Hands of Signior <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenato,</hi> with that Reſpect which became his Quality.
