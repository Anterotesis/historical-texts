            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I had finiſh'd my din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and drank the King of France's health, to ſatisfy my mind that I bore him no ſpleen, but, on the contrary, high honour for the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his temper—I roſe up an inch taller for the accommodation.</p>
            <p>—No—ſaid I—the Bourbon is by no means a cruel race: they may be miſled like other people; but there is a mildneſs in their blood. As I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this, I felt a ſuffuſion of a finer kind upon my cheek—more warm and friendly to man, than
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1269300201:24"/>
what Burgundy (at leaſt of two livres a bottle, which was ſuch as I had been drinking) could have produced.</p>

            <p>When man is at peace with man, how much lighter than a feather is the heavieſt of metals in his hand! he pulls out his purſe, and holding it airily and uncompreſs'd, looks round him, as if he ſought for an object to ſhare it with—In doing this, I felt

every veſſel in my frame dilate—the arteries beat all chearily together, and every power which ſuſtained life, perform'd it with ſo little friction, that 'twould have confounded the moſt <hi>phyſical precieuſe</hi> in France: with all her materialiſm, ſhe could ſcarce have called me a machine—</p>
            <p>I'm confident, ſaid I to myſelf, I ſhould have overſet her creed.</p>

            <head>CALAIS.</head>
            <p>I HAD ſcarce utter'd the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg ſomething for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the ſport of contingencies—or one man may be generous, as another man is puiſſant—<hi>ſed non, quo ad hanc</hi>—or be it as it may—for there is no regular reaſoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the ſame cauſes, for ought I know, which influence the tides themſelves—'twould oft be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1269300201:28"/>
to us, to ſuppoſe it was ſo: I'm ſure at leaſt for myſelf, that in many a caſe I ſhould be more highly ſatisfied, to have it ſaid by the world, <q rend="inline">"I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither ſin nor ſhame,"</q> than have it paſs altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was ſo much of both.</p>
            <p>—But be this as it may. The moment I caſt my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to give him a ſingle ſous; and accordingly I put my purſe into my pocket—button'd it up—ſet myſelf a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was ſomething, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1269300201:29"/>
figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which deſerved better.</p>
            <p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonſure, a few ſcatter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about ſeventy—but from his eyes, and that ſort of fire which was in them, which ſeemed more temper'd by courteſy than years, could be no more than ſixty—Truth might lie between—He was certainly ſixty-five; and the general air of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, notwithſtanding ſomething ſeem'd to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1269300201:30"/>
It was one of thoſe heads, which Guido has often painted—mild, pale—penetrating, free from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place ideas of fat contented ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance looking downwards upon the earth—it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at ſomething beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's ſhoulders, beſt knows: but it would have ſuited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indoſtan, I had reverenced it.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his outline may be given in a few ſtrokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to deſign, for 'twas neither elegant or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1269300201:31"/>
otherwiſe, but as character and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made it ſo: it was a thin, ſpare form, ſomething above the common ſize, if it loſt not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction by a bend forwards in the figure—but it was the attitude of Intreaty; and as it now ſtands pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my imagination, it gain'd more than it loſt by it.</p>
            <p>When he had enter'd the room three paces, he ſtood ſtill; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his left hand upon his breaſt, (a ſlender white ſtaff with which he journey'd being in his right)—when I had got cloſe up to him, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced himſelf with the little ſtory of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order—and did it with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1269300201:32"/>
ſo ſimple a grace—and ſuch an air of deprecation was there in the whole caſt of his look and figure—I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd not to have been ſtruck with it—</p>
            <p>—A better reaſon was, I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined not to give him a ſingle ſous.</p>

            <p>—'TIS very true, ſaid I, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a caſt upwards with his eyes, with which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his addreſs—'tis very true—and heaven be their reſource who have no other but the charity of the world, the ſtock of which, I fear, is no way ſufficient for the many <hi>great claims</hi> which are hourly made upon it.</p>
            <p>As I pronounced the words <hi>great claims,</hi> he gave a ſlight glance with his eye downwards upon the ſleeve

of his tunick—I felt the full force of the appeal—I acknowledge it, ſaid I—a coarſe habit, and that but once in three years, with meagre diet—are no great matters; and the true point of pity is, as they can be earn'd in the world with ſo little induſtry, that your order ſhould wiſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them by preſſing upon a fund which is the property of the lame, the blind, the aged and the infirm—the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, languiſhes alſo for his ſhare of it; and had you been of the <hi>order of mercy,</hi> inſtead of the order of St. Francis, poor as I am, continued I, pointing at my portmanteau, full chearfully ſhould it have been open'd

to you, for the ranſom of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate—The monk made me a bow—but of all others, reſumed I, the unfortunate of our own country, ſurely, have the firſt rights; and I have left thouſands in diſtreſs upon our own ſhore—The monk gave a cordial wave with his head—as much as to ſay, No doubt, there is miſery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our convent—But we diſtinguiſh, ſaid I, laying my hand upon the ſleeve of his tunick, in return for his appeal—we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, my good Father! betwixt thoſe who wiſh only to eat the bread of their own labour—and thoſe who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get

            <p>WHEN a man is diſcontented with himſelf, it has one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage however, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain. Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaiſe—and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fitteſt for, I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind to my purpoſe: an old <note n="*" place="bottom">A chaiſe, ſo called in France, from its bolding but one perſon.</note> Deſobligeant in the furtheſt corner of the court, hit my fancy at firſt ſight, ſo I inſtantly got into it,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1269300201:40"/>
and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Monſieur Deſſein the maſter of the hôtel—but Monſieur Deſſein being gone to veſpers, and not caring to face the Franciſcan whom I ſaw on the oppoſite ſide of the court, in conference with a lady juſt arrived, at the inn—I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink, and wrote the preface to it in the <hi>Diſobligeant.</hi>

            <head>PREFACE, IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</head>
            <p>IT muſt have been obſerved by many a peripatetic philoſopher, That nature has ſet up by her own unqueſtionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the diſcontent of man: ſhe has effected her purpoſe in the quieteſt and eaſieſt manner by laying him under almoſt inſuperable obligations to work out his eaſe, and to ſuſtain his ſufferings at home. It is there only that ſhe has provided him with the moſt ſuitable objects to partake of his happineſs, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1269300201:42"/>
for one pair of ſhoulders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of ſpreading our happineſs ſometimes beyond <hi>her</hi> limits, but 'tis ſo ordered, that from the want of languages, connections, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, and from the difference in education, cuſtoms and habits, we lie under ſo many impediments in communicating our ſenſations out of our own ſphere, as often amount to a total impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of ſentimental com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is always againſt the expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triated adventurer: he muſt buy what he has little occaſion for at their own price—his converſation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1269300201:43"/>
will ſeldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large diſcount—and this, by the by, eternally driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into the hands of more equitable brokers for ſuch conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as he can find, it requires no great ſpirit of divination to gueſs at his party—</p>
            <p>This brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the ſee-ſaw of this <hi>Deſobligeant</hi> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the final cauſes of travelling—</p>

    (meaning thereby myſelf) who have

    and the <hi>beſoin de</hi> Voyager, as any one 
    in the claſs.</p>
            <p>I am well aware, at the ſame time, as both my travels and obſervations will be altogether of a different caſt from any of my fore-runners; that I might have inſiſted upon a whole nitch entirely to myſelf—but I ſhould break in upon the confines of the <hi>Vain</hi> Traveller, in wiſhing to draw attention towards me, till I have ſome better grounds for it, than the mere <hi>Novelty of my Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle.</hi>

It is ſufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller himſelf, that with ſtudy and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue—it will be one ſtep towards knowing himſelf; as it is great odds, but he retains ſome tincture and reſemblance, of what he imbibed or carried out, to the preſent hour.</p>
            <p>The man who firſt tranſplanted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good Hope (obſerve he was a Dutch man) never dreamt of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame wine at the Cape, that the ſame grape produced upon the French mountains—he was too phlegmatic for that—but undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1269300201:51"/>
he expected to drink ſome ſort of vinous liquor; but whether good, bad, or indifferent—he knew enough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called <hi>chance</hi> was to decide his ſucceſs: however, he hoped for the beſt; and in theſe hopes, by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his diſcretion, <hi>Mynheer</hi> might poſſibly overſet both in his new vineyard; and by diſcovering his nakedneſs, become a laughing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock to his people.</p>
            <p>Even ſo it fares with the poor Traveller, ſailing and poſting through the politer kingdoms of the globe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1269300201:52"/>
in purſuit of knowledge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</p>
            <p>Knowledge and improvements are to be got by ſailing and poſting for that purpoſe; but whether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knowledge and real improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is all a lottery—and even where the adventurer is ſucceſsful, the acquired ſtock muſt be uſed with caution and ſobriety to turn to any profit—but as the chances run prodigiouſly the other way both as to the acquiſition and application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wiſely, if he could prevail upon himſelf, to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements, eſpecially
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1269300201:53"/>
if he lives in a country that has no abſolute want of either—and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and many a time coſt me, when I have obſerved how many a foul ſtep the inquiſitive Traveller has meaſured to ſee ſights and look into diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries; all which, as Sancho Panca ſaid to Don Quixote, they might have ſeen dry-ſhod at home. It is an age ſo full of light, that there is ſcarce a country or corner of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope whoſe beams are not croſſed and interchanged with others—Knowledge in moſt of its branches, and in moſt affairs, is like muſic in an Italian ſtreet, whereof thoſe may partake, who pay nothing—But there is no nation under heaven
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1269300201:54"/>
—and God is my record, (before whoſe tribunal I muſt one day come and give an account of this work)—that I do not ſpeak it vauntingly—But there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—where the ſciences may be more fitly woo'd, or more ſurely won than here—where art is encouraged, and will ſo ſoon riſe high—where Nature (take her all together) has ſo little to anſwer for—and, to cloſe all, where there is more wit and variety of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to feed the mind with—Where then, my dear countrymen, are you going—</p>
            <p>—We are only looking at this chaiſe, ſaid they—Your moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

ſervant, ſaid I, ſkipping out of it, and pulling off my hat—We were wondering, ſaid one of them, who, I found, was an <hi>inquiſitive traveller</hi>—what could occaſion its motion.——'Twas the agitation, ſaid I coolly, of writing a preface—I never heard, ſaid the other, who was a <hi>ſimple tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> of a preface wrote in a <hi>Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeant.</hi>—It would have been better, ſaid I, in a <hi>Vis a Vis.</hi>

            <p>I Perceived that ſomething darken'd the paſſage more than myſelf, as I ſtepp'd along it to my room; it was effectually Monſ. Deſſein, the maſter of the hôtel, who had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from veſpers, and, with his hat under his arm, was moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſantly following me, to put me in mind of my wants. I had wrote my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pretty well out of conceit with the <hi>Deſobligeant;</hi> and Monſ. Deſſein ſpeaking of it, with a ſhrug, as if it would no way ſuit me, it immediately ſtruck my fancy that it belong'd to ſome <hi>innocent traveller,</hi> who, on his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1269300201:57"/>
return home, had left it to Monſ. Deſſein's honour to make the moſt of. Four months had elapſed ſince it had finiſh'd its career of Europe in the corner of Monſ. Deſſein's coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; and having ſallied out from thence but a vampt-up buſineſs at the firſt, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it had not profited much by its adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—but by none ſo little as the ſtanding ſo many months unpitied in the corner of Monſ. Deſſein's coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. Much indeed was not to be ſaid for it—but ſomething might—and when a few words will reſcue miſery out of her diſtreſs, I hate the man who can be a churl of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1269300201:58"/>
—Now was I the maſter of this hôtel, ſaid I, laying the point of my fore-finger on Monſ. Deſſein's breaſt, I would inevitably make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate <hi>Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeant</hi>—itſtands ſwinging reproaches at you every time you paſs by it—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> ſaid Monſ. Deſſein—I have no intereſt—Except the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſaid I, which men of a certain turn of mind take, Monſ. Deſſein, in their own ſenſations—I'm perſuaded, to a man who feels for others as well as for himſelf, every rainy night, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe it as you will, muſt caſt a damp upon your ſpirits—You ſuffer, Monſ. Deſſein, as much as the machine—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1269300201:59"/>
I have always obſerved, when there is as much <hi>ſour</hi> as <hi>ſweet</hi> in a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that an Engliſhman is eternally at a loſs within himſelf, whether to take it, or let it alone: a Frenchman never is: Monſ. Deſſein made me a bow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C'eſt bien vrai,</hi> ſaid he—But in this caſe I ſhould only exchange one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude for another, and with loſs: figure to yourſelf, my dear Sir, that in giving you a chaiſe which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to Paris—figure to yourſelf how much I ſhould ſuffer, in giving an ill impreſſion of myſelf to a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and lying at the mercy, as I muſt do, <hi>d'un homme d'eſprit.</hi>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1269300201:60"/>
The doſe was made up exactly after my own preſcription; ſo I could not help taking it—and returning Monſ. Deſſein his bow, without more caſuiſtry we walk'd together towards his Remiſe, to take a view of his magazine of chaiſes.</p>

            <p>IT muſt needs be a hoſtile kind of a world, when the buyer (if it be but of a ſorry poſt-chaiſe) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go forth with the ſeller there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into the ſtreet to terminate the difference betwixt them, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly falls into the ſame frame of mind and views his conventioniſt with the ſame ſort of eye, as if he was going along with him to Hyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>park corner to fight a duel. For my own part, being but a poor ſword's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and no way a match for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Deſſein,</hi> I felt the rotation of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1269300201:62"/>
all the movements within me, to which the ſituation is incident—I looked at Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> through and through—ey'd him as he walked along in profile—then, <hi>en face</hi>—thought he look'd like a Jew—then a Turk—diſliked his wig—curſed him by my gods—wiſhed him at the devil—</p>
            <p>—And is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of three or four louisd'ors, which is the moſt I can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd in?—Baſe paſſion! ſaid I, turning myſelf about, as a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally does upon a ſudden reverſe of ſentiment—baſe, ungentle paſſion! thy hand is againſt every man, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1269300201:63"/>
every man's hand againſt thee—heaven forbid! ſaid ſhe, raiſing her hand up to her forehead, for I had turned full in front upon the lady whom I had ſeen in conference with the monk—ſhe had followed us unperceived—Heaven forbid indeed! ſaid I, offering her my own—ſhe had a black pair of ſilk gloves open only at the thumb and two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingers, ſo accepted it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve—and I led her up to the door of the Remiſe.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> had <hi>diabled</hi> the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as himſelf to have it open'd; and ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1269300201:64"/>
attentive to the obſtacle, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued holding her hand almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it; ſo that Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> left us together with her hand in mine, and with our faces turned towards the door of the Remiſe, and ſaid he would be back in five minutes.</p>
            <p>Now a colloquy of five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, in ſuch a ſituation, is worth one of as many ages, with your faces turned towards the ſtreet: in the latter caſe, 'tis drawn from the objects and occurrences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out—when your eyes are fixed upon a dead blank—you draw purely from yourſelves. A ſilence of a ſingle moment upon Monſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi>'s
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1269300201:65"/>
leaving us, had been fatal: to the ſituation—ſhe had infallibly turned about—ſo I begun the converſation inſtantly.—</p>
            <p>—But what were the temptations, (as I write not to apologize for the weakneſſes of my heart in this tour,—but to give an account of them)—ſhall be deſcribed with the ſame ſimplicity, with which I felt them.</p>

When the heart flies out before the underſtanding, it ſaves the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a world of pains—I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhe was of a better order of beings—however, I thought no more of her, but went on and wrote my preface.</p>
            <p>The impreſſion returned, upon my encounter with her in the ſtreet; a guarded frankneſs with which ſhe gave me her hand, ſhewed, I thought, her good education and her good ſenſe; and as I led her on, I felt a pleaſurable ductility about her, which ſpread a calmneſs over all my ſpirits—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1269300201:68"/>
—Good God! how a man might lead ſuch a creature as this round the world with him!—</p>
            <p>I had not yet ſeen her face—'twas not material; for the drawing was inſtantly ſet about, and long before we had got to the door of the Remiſe, <hi>Fancy</hi> had finiſhed the whole head, and pleaſed herſelf as much with its fitting her goddeſs, as if ſhe had dived into the TIBER for it—but thou art a ſeduced, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſlut; and albeit thou cheateſt us ſeven times a day with thy pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and images, yet with ſo many charms doſt thou do it, and thou deckeſt out thy pictures in the ſhapes of ſo many angels of light, 'tis a ſhame to break with thee.</p>

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1269300201:69"/>
When we had got to the door of the Remiſe, ſhe withdrew her hand from acroſs her forehead, and let me ſee the original—it was a face of about ſix and twenty—of a clear tranſparent brown, ſimply ſet off without rouge or powder—it was not critically handſome, but there was that in it, which in the frame of mind I was in, which attached me much more to it—it was intereſting; I fancied it wore the characters of a widow'd look, and in that ſtate of its declenſion, which had paſſed the two firſt paroxyſms of ſorrow, and was quietly beginning to reconcile itſelf to its loſs—but a thouſand other diſtreſſes might have traced the ſame lines; I wiſh'd to know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1269300201:70"/>
what they had been—and was ready to enquire, (had the ſame <hi>bon ton</hi> of converſation permitted, as in the days of Eſdras)—<q rend="inline">"<hi>What aileth thee? and why art thou diſquieted? and why is thy underſtanding troubled?</hi>"</q>—In a word, I felt benevolence for her; and reſolved ſome way or other to throw in my mite of courteſy—if not of ſervice.</p>
            <p>Such were my temptations—and in this diſpoſition to give way to them, was I left alone with the lady with her hand in mine, and with our faces both turned cloſer to the door of the Remiſe than what was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary.</p>

            <p>THIS certainly, fair lady! ſaid I, raiſing her hand up a little lightly as I began, muſt be one of Fortune's whimſical doings: to take two utter ſtrangers by their hands—of different ſexes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from different corners of the globe, and in one moment place them together in ſuch a cordial ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as Friendſhip herſelf could ſcarce have atchieved for them, had ſhe projected it for a month—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1269300201:72"/>
—And your reflection upon it, ſhews how much, Monſieur, ſhe has embaraſſed you by the adventure.—</p>
            <p>When the ſituation is, what we would wiſh, nothing is ſo ill-timed as to hint at the circumſtances which make it ſo: you thank Fortune, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe—you had reaſon—the heart knew it, and was ſatisfied; and who but an Engliſh philoſopher would have ſent notices of it to the brain to reverſe the judgment?</p>
            <p>In ſaying this, ſhe diſengaged her hand with a look which I thought a ſufficient commentary upon the text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1269300201:73"/>
It is a miſerable picture which I am going to give of the weakneſs of my heart, by owning, that it ſuffered a pain, which worthier occaſions could not have inflicted.—I was mortified with the loſs of her hand, and the manner in which I had loſt it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound: I never felt the pain of a ſheepiſh inferiority ſo miſerably in my life.</p>
            <p>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are ſhort upon theſe diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In a very few ſeconds ſhe laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to finiſh her reply; ſo ſome way or other, God knows how, I regained my ſituation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1269300201:74"/>
—She had nothing to add.</p>
            <p>I forthwith began to model a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent converſation for the lady, thinking from the ſpirit as well as moral of this, that I had been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in her character; but upon turning her face towards me, the ſpirit which had animated the reply was fled—the muſcles relaxed, and I beheld the ſame unprotected look of diſtreſs which firſt won me to her intereſt—melancholy! to ſee ſuch ſprightlineſs the prey of ſorrow.—I pitied her from my ſoul; and though it may ſeem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart,—I could have taken her into my arms, and cheriſhed her,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1269300201:75"/>
though it was in the open ſtreet, without bluſhing.</p>
            <p>The pulſations of the arteries along my fingers preſſing acroſs hers, told her what was paſſing within me: ſhe looked down—a ſilence of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments followed.</p>
            <p>I fear, in this interval, I muſt have made ſome ſlight efforts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a cloſer compreſſion of her hand, from a ſubtle ſenſation I felt in the palm of my own—not as if ſhe was going to withdraw hers—but, as if ſhe thought about it—and I had infallibly loſt it a ſecond time, had not inſtinct more than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon directed me to the laſt reſource
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1269300201:76"/>
in theſe dangers—to hold it looſely, and in a manner as if I was every moment going to releaſe it, of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo ſhe let it continue, till Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Deſſein</hi> returned with the key; and in the mean time I ſet myſelf to conſider how I ſhould undo the ill impreſſions which the poor monk's ſtory, in caſe he had told it her, muſt have planted in her breaſt againſt me.</p>

            <head>CALAIS.</head>
            <p>THE good old monk was within ſix paces of us, as the idea of him croſs'd my mind; and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards us a little out of the line, as if uncertain whether he ſhould break in upon us or no.—He ſtopp'd, however, as ſoon as he came up to us, with a world of frankneſs; and having a horn ſnuff-box in his hand, he preſented it open to me—You ſhall taſte mine—ſaid I, pulling out my box (which was a ſmall tortoiſe one) and putting it into his hand—
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1269300201:78"/>
'Tis moſt excellent, ſaid the monk; Then do me the favour, I replied, to accept of the box and all, and when you take a pinch out of it, ſometimes recollect it was the peace-offering of a man who once uſed you unkindly, but not from his heart.</p>
            <p>The poor monk bluſh'd as red as ſcarlet. <hi>Mon Dieu!</hi> ſaid he, preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands together—you never uſed me unkindly.—I ſhould think, ſaid the lady, he is not likely. I bluſh'd in my turn; but from what movements, I leave to the few who feel to analyſe—Excuſe me, Madame, replied I—I treated him moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly; and from no provocations—'Tis impoſſible, ſaid the lady.—My
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1269300201:79"/>
God! cried the monk, with a warmth of aſſeveration which ſeemed not to belong to him—the fault was in me, and in the indiſcretion of my zeal—the lady oppoſed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impoſſible, that a ſpirit ſo regulated as his, could give offence to any.</p>
            <p>I knew not that contention could be rendered ſo ſweet and pleaſurable a thing to the nerves as I then felt it.—We remained ſilent, without any ſenſation of that fooliſh pain which takes place, when in ſuch a circle you look for ten minutes in one another's faces without ſaying a word. Whilſt this laſted, the monk rubb'd his horn box upon the ſleeve of his tunick;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1269300201:80"/>
and as ſoon as it had acquired a little air of brightneſs by the friction—he made a low bow, and ſaid, 'twas too late to ſay whether it was the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or goodneſs of our tempers which had involved us in this conteſt—but be it as it would—he begg'd we might exchange boxes—In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he preſented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the other; and having kiſs'd it—with a ſtream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his boſom—and took his leave.</p>
            <p>I guard this box, as I would the inſtrumental parts of my religion, to help my mind on to ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in truth, I ſeldom go abroad
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1269300201:81"/>
without it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the courteous ſpirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the juſtlings of the world; they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from his ſtory, till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when upon ſome military ſervices ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, and meeting at the ſame time with a diſappointment in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt of paſſions, he abandon'd the ſword and the ſex together, and took ſanctuary, not ſo much in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as in himſelf.</p>
            <p>I feel a damp upon my ſpirits, as I am going to add, that in my laſt return through Calais, upon inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Father Lorenzo, I heard

he had been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent, but, according to his deſire, in a little cimetiery belonging to it, about two leagues off: I had a ſtrong deſire to ſee where they had laid him—when, upon pulling out his little horn box, as I ſat by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no buſineſs to grow there, they all ſtruck together ſo forcibly upon my affections, that I burſt into a flood of tears—but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to ſmile, but pity me.</p>

            <p>Now the two travellers who had ſpoke to me in the coach-yard, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening at that criſis to be paſſing by, and obſerving our communications, naturally took it into their heads that

            <p>—Now where would be the harm, ſaid I to myſelf, if I was to beg of this diſtreſſed lady to accept of half of my chaiſe?—and what mighty miſchief could enſue?</p>
            <p>Every dirty paſſion, and bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity in my nature, took the alarm, as I ſtated the propoſition—It will oblige you to have a third horſe, ſaid AVARICE, which will put twenty livres out of your pocket.—You know not who ſhe is, ſaid CAUTION—or what ſcrapes the affair may draw you into, whiſper'd COWARDICE—</p>

            <p>MONSIEUR <hi>Deſſein</hi> came back to let us out of the chaiſe, and acquaint the lady, the Count de L<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>—You need not tell me what the propoſal was, ſaid ſhe, laying her

hand upon both mine, as ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me.—A man, my good Sir, has ſeldom an offer of kindneſs to make-to a woman, but ſhe has a preſentiment of it ſome moments before—</p>
            <p>Nature arms her with it, ſaid I, for immediate preſervation—But I think, ſaid ſhe, looking in my face, I had no evil to apprehend—and to deal frankly with you, had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to accept it.—If I had—(ſhe ſtopped a moment)—I believe your good will would have drawn a ſtory from me, which would have made pity the only dangerous thing in the journey.</p>

            <p>I NEVER finiſhed a twelve-guinea bargain ſo expeditiouſly in my life: my time ſeemed heavy upon the loſs of the lady, and knowing every moment of it would be as two, till I put myſelf into motion—I ordered poſt horſes directly, and walked towards the hotel.</p>

            <p>I HAD once loſt my portmanteau from behind my chaiſe, and twice got out in the rain, and one of the times up to the knees in dirt, to help the poſtilion to tie it on, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to find out what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—Nor was it till I got to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triul, upon the landlord's aſking me if I wanted not a ſervant, that it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to me, that that was the very thing.</p>
            <p>A ſervant! That I do moſt ſadly, quoth I—Becauſe, Monſieur, ſaid the landlord, there is a clever young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

who would be very proud of the honour to ſerve an Engliſhman—But why an Engliſh one, more than any other?—They are ſo generous, ſaid the landlord—I'll be ſhot if this is not a livre out of my pocket, quoth I to myſelf, this very night—But they have wherewithal to be ſo, Monſieur, added he—Set down one livre more for that, quoth I—It was but laſt night, ſaid the landlord, <hi>qu'un my Lord Anglois preſentoit un ecu a la fille de chambre</hi>—<hi>Tant pis, pour Madlle Janatone,</hi> ſaid I.</p>

of which, having ſatisfied the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and found moreover, That the honour of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward, as it open'd no further track of glory to him—he retired <hi>a ſes terres,</hi> and lived <hi>comme il plaiſoit a Dieu</hi>—that is to ſay, upon nothing.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1269300201:126"/>
was I hourly recompenced by the feſtivity of his temper—it ſupplied all defects—I had a conſtant reſource in his looks in all difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of my own—I was going to have added, of his too; but La Fleur was out of the reach of every thing; for whether 'twas hunger or thirſt; or cold or nakedneſs, or watchings, or whatever ſtripes of ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings, there was no index in his phyſiognomy to point them out by—he was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ſame; ſo that if I am a piece of a philoſopher, which Satan now and then puts it into my head I am—it always mortifies the pride of the conceit, by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional philoſophy
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1269300201:127"/>
of this poor fellow, for ſhaming me into one of a better kind. With all this, La Fleur had a ſmall caſt of the coxcomb—but he ſeemed at firſt ſight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art; and before I had been three days in Paris with him—he ſeemed to be no coxcomb at all.</p>

retiring two ſteps out of the circle, and making a diſqualifying bow on his part. Had the whole parterre cried out, <hi>Place aux dames,</hi> with one voice, it would not have conveyed the ſentiment of a deference for the ſex with half the effect.</p>
            <p>Juſt heaven! for what wiſe reaſons haſt thou order'd it, that beggary and urbanity, which are at ſuch variance in other countries, ſhould find a way to be at unity in this?</p>

A poor little dwarfiſh briſk fellow, who ſtood over-againſt me in the circle, putting ſomething firſt under his arm, which had once been a hat, took his ſnuff-box out of his pocket, and generouſly offer'd a pinch on both ſides of him: it was a gift of conſequence, and modeſtly declined—The poor little fellow preſs'd it upon them with a nod of welcomeneſs—<hi>Prenez en</hi>—<hi>prenez,</hi> ſaid he, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another way; ſo they each took a pinch—Pity thy box ſhould ever want one! ſaid I to myſelf; ſo I put a couple of ſous into it—taking a ſmall pinch out of his box, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their value, as I did it—He felt the weight of the ſecond obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than that of the firſt—'twas
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1269300201:139"/>
doing him an honour—the other was only doing him a charity—and he made me a bow down to the ground for it.</p>
            <p>—Here! ſaid I to an old ſoldier with one hand, who had been cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign'd and worn out to death in the ſervice—here's a couple of ſous for thee—<hi>Vive le Roi!</hi> ſaid the old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
            <p>I had then but three ſous left: ſo I gave one, ſimply <hi>pour l'amour de Dieu,</hi> which was the footing on which it was begg'd—The poor woman had a diſlocated hip; ſo it could not be well, upon any other motive.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>My Lord Anglois</hi>—the very ſound was worth the money—ſo I gave <hi>my laſt ſous for it.</hi> But in the eagerneſs of giving, I had overlook'd a <hi>pauvre honteux,</hi> who had no one to aſk a ſous for him, and who, I believed, would have periſh'd, ere he could have aſk'd one for himſelf: he ſtood by the chaiſe a little without the circle, and wiped a tear from a face which I thought had ſeen better days—Good God! ſaid I—and I have not one ſingle ſous left to give him—But you have a thouſand! cried all the powers of nature, ſtirring within me—ſo I gave him—no matter what—I am

aſhamed to ſay <hi>how much,</hi> now—and was aſhamed to think, how little, then: ſo if the reader can form any conjecture of my diſpoſition, as theſe two fixed points are given him, he may judge within a livre or two what was the preciſe ſum.</p>

            <head>THE BIDET.</head>
            <p>HAVING ſettled all theſe little matters, I got into my poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiſe with more eaſe than ever I got into a poſt-chaiſe in my life; and La Fleur having got one large jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boot on the far ſide of a little <hi>bidet</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Poſt horſe.</note>, and another on this (for I count no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his legs)—he canter'd away before me as happy and as perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular as a prince.—</p>
            <p>—But what is happineſs! what is grandeur in this painted ſcene of life! A dead aſs, before we had got a league, put a ſudden ſtop to La Fleur's career—his bidet would not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1269300201:143"/>
paſs by it—a contention aroſe betwixt them, and the poor fellow was kick'd out of his jack-boots the very firſt kick.</p>
            <p>La Fleur bore his fall like a French chriſtian, ſaying neither more or leſs upon it, than, Diable! ſo preſently got up and came to the charge again aſtride his bidet, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him up to it as he would have beat his drum.</p>
            <p>The bidet flew from one ſide of the road to the other, then back again—then this way—then that way, and in ſhort every way but by the dead aſs.—La Fleur inſiſted upon the thing—and the bidet threw him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1269300201:144"/>
What's the matter, La Fleur, ſaid I, with this bidet of thine?—<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>c'eſt un cheval le plus opiniatré du monde</hi>—Nay, if he is a conceited beaſt, he muſt go his own way, replied I—ſo La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good ſound laſh, the bidet took me at my word, and away he ſcamper'd back to Montriul.—<hi>Peſte!</hi> ſaid La Fleur.</p>
            <p>It is not <hi>mal a propos</hi> to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice here, that tho' La Fleur availed himſelf but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter—namely, <hi>Diable!</hi> and <hi>Peſte!</hi> that there are nevertheleſs three, in the French language; like the poſitive, comparative, and ſuperlative, one or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1269300201:145"/>
the other of which ſerve for every unexpected throw of the dice in life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Le Diable!</hi> which is the firſt, and poſitive degree, is generally uſed upon ordinary emotions of the mind, where ſmall things only fall out contrary to your expectations—ſuch as—the throwing once doublets—La Fleur's being kick'd off his horſe, and ſo forth—cuckoldom, for the ſame reaſon, is always—<hi>Le Diable!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in caſes where the caſt has ſomething provoking in it, as in that of the bidet's running away after, and leaving La Fleur aground in jack-boots—'tis the ſecond degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1269300201:146"/>
'Tis then <hi>Peſte!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the third—</p>
            <p>—But here my heart is wrung with pity and fellow-feeling, when I reflect what miſeries muſt have been their lot, and how bitterly ſo refined a people muſt have ſmarted, to have forced them upon the uſe of it.—</p>
            <p>Grant me, O ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in diſtreſs!—whatever is my <hi>caſt,</hi> Grant me but decent words to exclaim in, and I will give my nature way.</p>
            <p>—But as theſe were not to be had in France, I reſolved to take every

            <p>La Fleur, who had made no ſuch covenant with himſelf, followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of ſight—and then, you may imagine, if you pleaſe, with what word he cloſed the whole affair.</p>
            <p>As there was no hunting down a frighten'd horſe in jack-boots, there remained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaiſe, or into it.—</p>
            <p>I preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the poſt-houſe at Nampont.</p>

            <head>THE DEAD ASS.</head>
            <p>—AND this, ſaid he, putting the remains of a cruſt into his wallet—and this, ſhould have been thy portion, ſaid he, hadſt thou been alive to have ſhared it with me. I thought by the accent, it had been an apoſtrophe to his child; but 'twas to his aſs, and to the very aſs we had ſeen dead in the road, which had occaſioned La Fleur's miſadventure. The man ſeemed to lament it much; and it inſtantly brought into my mind Sancho's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1269300201:151"/>
for his; but he did it with more true touches of nature.</p>
            <p>The mourner was ſitting upon a ſtone bench at the door, with the aſs's pannel and its bridle on one ſide, which he took up from time to time—then laid them down—look'd at them and ſhook his head. He then took his cruſt of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it ſome time in his hand—then laid it upon the bit of his aſs's bridle—looked wiſtfully at the little arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had made—and then gave a ſigh.</p>
            <p>The ſimplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1269300201:152"/>
amongſt the reſt, whilſt the horſes were getting ready; as I continued ſitting in the poſt-chaiſe, I could ſee and hear over their heads.</p>
            <p>—He ſaid he had come laſt from Spain, where he had been from the furtheſt borders of Franconia; and had got ſo far on his return home, when his aſs died. Every one ſeem'd deſirous to know what buſineſs could have taken ſo old and poor a man ſo far a journey from his own home.</p>
            <p>It had pleaſed heaven, he ſaid, to bleſs him with three ſons, the fineſt lads in all Germany; but having in one week loſt two of the eldeſt of them by the ſmall-pox, and the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1269300201:153"/>
youngeſt falling ill of the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if Heaven would not take him from him alſo, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain.</p>
            <p>When the mourner got thus far on his ſtory, he ſtopp'd to pay nature her tribute—and wept bitterly.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, Heaven had accepted the conditions; and that he had ſet out from his cottage with this poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who had been a patient partner of his journey—that it had eat the ſame bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1269300201:154"/>
Every body who ſtood about, heard the poor fellow with concern——La Fleur offered him money.—The mourner ſaid, he did not want it—it was not the value of the aſs—but the loſs of him.—The aſs, he ſaid, he was aſſured loved him—and upon this told them a long ſtory of a miſchance upon their paſſage over the Pyrenean mountains which had ſeparated them from each other three days; during which time the aſs had ſought him as much as he had ſought the aſs, and that they had neither ſcarce eat or drank till they met.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt one comfort, friend, ſaid I, at leaſt in the loſs of thy poor beaſt; I'm ſure thou haſt been a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1269300201:155"/>
maſter to him.—Alas! ſaid the mourner, I thought ſo, when he was alive—but now that he is dead I think otherwiſe.—I fear the weight of myſelf and my afflictions together have been too much for him—they have ſhortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to anſwer for.—Shame on the world! ſaid I to myſelf—Did we love each other, as this poor ſoul but loved his aſs—'twould be ſomething.—</p>

            <head>THE POSTILLION.</head>
            <p>THE concern which the poor fellow's ſtory threw me into, required ſome attention: the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillion paid not the leaſt to it, but ſet off upon the <hi>pavè</hi> in a full gallop.</p>
            <p>The thirſtieſt ſoul in the moſt ſandy deſert of Arabia could not have wiſhed more for a cup of cold water, than mine did for grave and quiet movements; and I ſhould have had an high opinion of the poſtillion had he but ſtolen off with me in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a penſive pace.—On the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1269300201:157"/>
contrary, as the mourner finiſhed his lamentation, the fellow gave an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling laſh to each of his beaſts, and ſet off clattering like a thouſand devils.</p>
            <p>I called to him as loud as I could, for heaven's ſake to go ſlower—and the louder I called the more unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully he galloped.—The deuce take him and his galloping too—ſaid I—he'll go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a fooliſh paſſion, and then he'll go ſlow, that I may enjoy the ſweets of it.</p>
            <p>The poſtillion managed the point to a miracle: by the time he had got
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1269300201:158"/>
to the foot of a ſteep hill about half a league from Nampont,—he had put me out of temper with him—and then with myſelf, for being ſo.</p>
            <p>My caſe then required a different treatment; and a good rattling gallop would have been of real ſervice to me.—</p>
            <p>—Then, prithee get on—get on, my good lad, ſaid I.</p>
            <p>The poſtillion pointed to the hill—I then tried to return back to the ſtory of the poor German and his aſs—but I had broke the clue—and could no more get into it again, than the poſtillion could into a trot.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1269300201:159"/>
—The deuce go, ſaid I, with it all! Here am I ſitting as candidly diſpoſed to make the beſt of the worſt, as ever wight was, and all runs counter.</p>
            <p>There is one ſweet lenitive at leaſt for evils, which nature holds out to us; ſo I took it kindly at her hands, and fell aſleep; and the firſt word which rouſed me was <hi>Amiens.</hi>

She was as good as her look; for, before I had quite finiſhed my ſupper, her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſervant came into the room with a billet, in which ſhe ſaid, ſhe had taken the liberty to charge me with a letter, which I was to preſent myſelf to Madame R*** the firſt

morning I had nothing to do at Paris.

            <p>There was nothing wrong in the ſentiment; and yet I inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached my heart with it in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and moſt reprobate of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

            <p>FORTUNE had not ſmiled upon La Fleur; for he had been unſucceſsful in his feats of chivalry—and not one thing had offer'd to ſignalize his zeal for my ſervice from the time he had enter'd into it, which was almoſt four and twenty hours. The poor ſoul burn'd with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and the Count de L***'s ſervant's coming with the letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt practicable occaſion which offered, La Fleur had laid hold of it; and in order to do honour to his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1269300201:167"/>
maſter, had taken him into a back parlour in the Auberge, and treated him with a cup or two of the beſt wine in Picardy; and the Count de L***'s ſervant in return, and not to be behind hand in politeneſs with La Fleur, had taken him back with him to the Count's hôtel. La Fleur's <hi>prevenancy</hi> (for there was a paſſport in his very looks) ſoon ſet every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the kitchen at eaſe with him; and as a Frenchman, whatever be his talents, has no ſort of prudery in ſhewing them, La Fleur, in leſs than five minutes, had pull'd out his fife, and leading off the dance himſelf with the firſt note, ſet the <hi>fille de chambre,</hi> the <hi>maitre d'hotel,</hi> the cook,

            <p>Madame de L***, in paſſing from her brother's apartments to her own, hearing ſo much jollity below ſtairs, rung up her <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to aſk about it; and hearing it was the Engliſh gentleman's ſervant who had ſet the whole houſe merry with his pipe, ſhe order'd him up.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1269300201:172"/>
for his own, as a man capable of being attach'd to a maſter who could be a wanting <hi>en egards vis a vis d'une femme;</hi> ſo that when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de L*** aſked La Fleur if he had brought a letter—<hi>O qu'oui,</hi> ſaid La Fleur: ſo laying down his hat upon the ground, and taking hold of the flap of his right ſide pocket with his left hand, he began to ſearch for the letter with his right—then contrary-wiſe—<hi>Diable!</hi>—then ſought every pocket—pocket by pocket, round, not forgetting his fob—<hi>Peſte!</hi>—then La Fleur emptied them upon the floor—pulled out a dirty cravat—a handkerchief—a comb—a whip laſh—a night-cap—then gave a peep
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1269300201:173"/>
into his hat—<hi>Quelle etourderie!</hi> He had left the letter upon the table in the Auberge—he would run for it, and be back with it in three minutes.</p>
            <p>I had juſt finiſhed my ſupper when La Fleur came in to give me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his adventure: he told the whole ſtory ſimply as it was; and only added, that if Monſieur had forgot <hi>(par hazard)</hi> to anſwer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame's letter, the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the <hi>faux pas</hi>—and if not, that things were only as they were.</p>
            <p>Now I was not altogether ſure of my <hi>etiquette,</hi> whether I ought to have wrote or no; but if I had—a devil
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1269300201:174"/>
himſelf could not have been angry 'twas but the officious zeal of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning creature for my honour; and however he might have miſtook the road—or embarraſſed me in ſo doing—his heart was in no fault—I was under no neceſſity to write—and what weighed more than all—he did not look as if he had done amiſs.</p>
            <p>—'Tis all very well, La Fleur, ſaid I.—'Twas ſufficient. La Fleur flew out of the room like lightening, and return'd with pen, ink, and paper, in his hand; and coming up to the table, laid them cloſe before me, with ſuch a delight in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that I could not help taking up the pen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1269300201:175"/>
I begun and begun again; and though I had nothing to ſay, and that nothing might have been expreſs'd in half a dozen lines, I made half a dozen different beginnings, and could no way pleaſe myſelf.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I was in no mood to write.</p>
            <p>La Fleur ſtepp'd out and brought a little water in a glaſs to dilute my ink—then fetch'd ſand and ſeal-wax—It was all one: I wrote, and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tore off, and burnt, and wrote again—<hi>Le Diable l'emporte!</hi> ſaid I half to myſelf—I cannot write this ſelf-ſame letter; throwing the pen down deſpairingly as I ſaid it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1269300201:176"/>
As ſoon as I had caſt down the pen, La Fleur advanced with the moſt reſpectful carriage up to the table, and making a thouſand apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for the liberty he was going to take, told me he had a letter in his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporal's wife, which, he durſt ſay, would ſuit the occaſion.</p>
            <p>I had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humour—Then prithee, ſaid I, let me ſee it.</p>
            <p>La Fleur inſtantly pull'd out a little dirty pocket-book cramm'd full of ſmall letters and billet-doux in a ſad condition, and laying it upon the table, and then untying the ſtring
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1269300201:177"/>
which held them all together, run them over one by one, till he came to the letter in queſtion—<hi>La voila!</hi> ſaid he, clapping his hands: ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding it firſt, he laid it before me, and retired three ſteps from the table whilſt I read it.</p>

            <p>I own my firſt ſenſations, as ſoon as I was left ſolitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel, were far from being ſo flattering as I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured them.

            <p>WHEN the barber came, he abſolutely refuſed to have any thing to do with my wig: 'twas either above or below his art: I had nothing to do, but to take one ready made of his own recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>—But I fear, friend! ſaid I, this buckle won't ſtand.—You may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge it, replied he, into the ocean, and it will ſtand—</p>
            <p>What a great ſcale is every thing upon in this city! thought I—The

but Paris being ſo far inland, it was not likely I ſhould run poſt a hundred miles out of it, to try the experiment—the Pariſian barber meant nothing.—</p>
            <p>The pail of water ſtanding beſides the great deep, makes certainly but a ſorry figure in ſpeech—but 'twill be ſaid—it has one advantage—'tis in the next room, and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado, in a ſingle moment.</p>

            <p>HAIL ye ſmall ſweet courteſies of life, for ſmooth do ye make the road of it! like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at firſt ſight; 'tis ye who open this door and let the ſtranger in.</p>
            <p>—Pray, Madame, ſaid I, have the goodneſs to tell me which way I muſt turn to go to the Opera comique:—Moſt willingly, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, laying aſide her work—</p>
            <p>I had given a caſt with my eye into half a dozen ſhops as I came
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1269300201:195"/>
along in ſearch of a face not likely to be diſordered by ſuch an interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; till at laſt, this hitting my fancy, I had walked in.</p>
            <p>She was working a pair of ruffles as ſhe ſat in a low chair on the far ſide of the ſhop facing the door—</p>
            <p>—<hi>Tres volentieres;</hi> moſt willingly, ſaid ſhe, laying her work down upon a chair next her, and riſing up from the low chair ſhe was ſitting in, with ſo chearful a movement and ſo chearful a look, that had I been laying out fifty louis d'ors with her, I ſhould have ſaid—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"This woman is grateful."</q>

You muſt turn, Monſieur, ſaid ſhe, going with me to the door of the ſhop, and pointing the way down the ſtreet I was to take—you muſt turn firſt to your left hand—<hi>mais prenez guarde</hi>—there are two turns; and be ſo good as to take the ſecond—then go down a little way and you'll ſee a church, and when you are paſt it, give yourſelf the trouble to turn directly to the right, and that will lead you to the foot of the <hi>pont neuf,</hi> which you muſt croſs—and there, any one will do himſelf the pleaſure to ſhew you—</p>
            <p>She repeated her inſtructions three times over to me with the ſame good natur'd patience the third time

as the firſt;—and if <hi>tones and manners</hi> have a meaning, which certainly they have, unleſs to hearts which ſhut them out—ſhe ſeem'd really intereſted, that I ſhould not loſe myſelf.</p>
            <p>I will not ſuppoſe it was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's beauty, notwithſtanding ſhe was the handſomeſt griſſet, I think, I ever ſaw, which had much to do with the ſenſe I had of her courteſy; only I remember, when I told her how much I was obliged to her, that I looked very full in her eyes,—and that I repeated my thanks as often as ſhe had done her inſtructions.</p>
            <p>I had not got ten paces from the door, before I found I had forgot

every tittle of what ſhe had ſaid—ſo looking back, and ſeeing her ſtill ſtanding in the door of the ſhop as if to look whether I went right or not—I returned back, to aſk her whether the firſt turn was to my right or left—for that I had abſolutely forgot.—Is it poſſible! ſaid ſhe, half laughing.—'Tis very poſſible, replied I, when a man is thinking more of a woman, than of her good advice.</p>
            <p>As this was the real truth—ſhe took it, as every woman takes a matter of right, with a ſlight courteſy.</p>

            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>THE beautiful Griſſet roſe up when I ſaid this, and going behind the counter, reach'd down a parcel and untied it: I advanced to the ſide over-againſt her: they were all too large. The beautiful Griſſet meaſured them one by one acroſs my hand—It would not alter the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—She begg'd I would try a ſingle pair, which ſeemed to be the leaſt—She held it open—my hand ſlipp'd into it at once—It will not do, ſaid I,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1269300201:210"/>
ſhaking my head a little—No, ſaid ſhe, doing the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>There are certain combined looks of ſimple ſubtlety—where whim, and ſenſe, and ſeriouſneſs, and nonſenſe, are ſo blended, that all the languages of Babel ſet looſe together could not expreſs them—they are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and caught ſo inſtantaneouſly, that you can ſcarce ſay which party is the infecter. I leave it to your men of words to ſwell pages about it—it is enough in the preſent to ſay again, the gloves would not do; ſo folding our hands within our arms, we both loll'd upon the counter—it was narrow, and there was juſt room for the parcel to lay between us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1269300201:211"/>
The beautiful Griſſet look'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the gloves, then ſide-ways to the window, then at the gloves—and then at me. I was not diſpoſed to break ſilence—I follow'd her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: ſo I look'd at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her—and ſo on alternately.</p>
            <p>I found I loſt conſiderably in every attack—ſhe had a quick black eye, and ſhot through two ſuch long and ſilken eye-laſhes with ſuch penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe look'd into my very heart and reins—It may ſeem ſtrange, but I could actually feel ſhe did—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:1269300201:212"/>
—It is no matter, ſaid I, taking up a couple of the pairs next me, and putting them into my pocket.</p>
            <p>I was ſenſible the beautiful Griſſet had not aſk'd above a ſingle livre above the price—I wiſh'd ſhe had aſk'd a livre more, and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about—Do you think, my dear Sir, ſaid ſhe, miſtaking my embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I could aſk a <hi>ſous</hi> too much of a ſtranger—and of a ſtranger whoſe politeneſs, more than his want of gloves, has done me the honour to lay himſelf at my mercy?—<hi>Men croyez capable?</hi>—Faith! not I, ſaid I; and if you were, you are welcome—

So counting the money into her hand, and with a lower bow than one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally makes to a ſhopkeeper's wife, I went out, and her lad with his parcel followed me.</p>

            <p>THERE was no body in the box I was let into but a kindly old French officer.

            <p>The old officer was reading atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively a ſmall pamphlet, it might be the book of the opera, with a large pair of ſpectacles.

I was going one evening to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini's concert at Milan, and was juſt entering the door of the hall, when the Marqueſina di F*** was coming out in a ſort of a hurry—ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upon me before I ſaw her; ſo I gave a ſpring to one ſide to let her paſs—She had done the ſame, and on the ſame ſide too; ſo we ran our heads together: ſhe inſtantly got to the other ſide to get out: I was juſt as unfortunate as ſhe had been; for I had ſprung to that ſide, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her paſſage again—We both flew together to the other ſide, and then back—and ſo on—it was ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; we both bluſh'd intolerably; ſo I did at laſt the thing I ſhould have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1269300201:221"/>
done at firſt—I ſtood ſtock ſtill, and the Marqueſina had no more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. I had no power to go into the room, till I had made her ſo much reparation as to wait and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her with my eye to the end of the paſſage—She look'd back twice, and walk'd along it rather ſide-ways, as if ſhe would make room for any one coming up ſtairs to paſs her—No, ſaid I—that's a vile tranſlation: the Marqueſina has a right to the beſt apology I can make her; and that opening is left for me to do it in—ſo I ran and begg'd pardon for the embarraſſment I had given her, ſaying it was my intention to have made her way.

            <head>THE DWARF.</head>
            <head>PARIS.</head>
            <p>I HAD never heard the remark made by any one in my life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by one; and who that was, will probably come out in this chapter; ſo that being pretty much unprepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, there muſt have been grounds for what ſtruck me the moment I caſt my eyes over the <hi>parterre</hi>—and that was, the unaccountable ſport of nature in forming ſuch numbers of dwarfs—No doubt, ſhe ſports at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times in almoſt every corner of the world; but in Paris, there is no
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1269300201:225"/>
end to her amuſements—The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs ſeems almoſt as merry as ſhe is wiſe.</p>
            <p>As I carried my idea out of the <hi>opera comique</hi> with me, I meaſured every body I ſaw walking in the ſtreets by it—Melancholy application! eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the ſize was extremely little—the face extremely dark—the eyes quick—the noſe long—the teeth white—the jaw prominent—to ſee ſo many miſerables, by force of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents driven out of their own proper claſs into the very verge of another, which it gives me pain to write down—every third man a pigmy!—ſome by ricketty heads and hump backs—
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1269300201:226"/>
others by bandy legs—a third ſet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the hand of Nature in the ſixth and ſeventh years of their growth—a fourth, in their perfect and natural ſtate, like dwarf apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees; from the firſt rudiments and ſtamina of their exiſtence, never meant to grow higher.</p>
            <p>A medical traveller might ſay, 'tis owing to undue bandages—a ſplene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic one, to want of air—and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive traveller, to fortify the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, may meaſure the height of their houſes—the narrowneſs of their ſtreets, and in how few feet ſquare in the ſixth and ſeventh ſtories ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Bourgoiſie</hi> eat and ſleep
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1269300201:227"/>
together; but I remember, Mr. Shandy the elder, who accounted for nothing like any body elſe, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one evening of theſe matters, averred, that children, like other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, might be increaſed almoſt to any ſize, provided they came right into the world; but the miſery was, the citizens of Paris were ſo coop'd up, that they had not actually room enough to get them—I do not call it getting any thing, ſaid he—'tis get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing—Nay, continued he, riſing in his argument, 'tis getting worſe than nothing, when all you have got, after twenty or five and twenty years of the tendereſt care and moſt nutritious aliment beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1269300201:228"/>
it, ſhall not at laſt be as high as my leg. Now, Mr. Shandy being very ſhort, there could be nothing more ſaid upon it.</p>
            <p>As this is not a work of reaſoning, I leave the ſolution as I found it, and content myſelf with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris. I was walking down that which leads from the Carouſal to the Palais Royal, and obſerving a little boy in ſome diſtreſs at the ſide of the gutter, which ran down the middle of it, I took hold of his hand, and help'd him over. Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1269300201:229"/>
forty—Never mind, ſaid I; ſome good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.</p>
            <p>I feel ſome little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my ſpecies, who have neither ſize or ſtrength to get on in the world—I cannot bear to ſee one of them trod upon; and had ſcarce got ſeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide my old French officer, ere the diſguſt was exerciſed, by ſeeing the very thing happen under the box we ſat in.</p>
            <p>At the end of the orcheſtra, and betwixt that and the firſt ſide-box,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1269300201:230"/>
there is a ſmall eſplanade left, where, when the houſe is full, numbers of all ranks take ſanctuary. Though you ſtand, as in the parterre, you pay the ſame price as in the orcheſtra. A poor defenceleſs being of this order had got thruſt ſome how or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this luckleſs place—the night was hot, and he was ſurrounded by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings two feet and a half higher than himſelf. The dwarf ſuffered inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly on all ſides; but the thing which incommoded him moſt, was a tall corpulent German, near ſeven feet high, who ſtood directly betwixt him and all poſſibility of his ſeeing either the ſtage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1269300201:231"/>
peep at what was going forwards, by ſeeking for ſome little opening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the German's arm and his body, trying firſt one ſide, then the other; but the German ſtood ſquare in the moſt unaccommodating poſture that can be imagined—the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepeſt draw-well in Paris; ſo he civilly reach'd up his hand to the German's ſleeve, and told him his diſtreſs—The German turn'd his head back, look'd down-upon him as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah did upon David—and unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reſumed his poſture.</p>
            <p>I was juſt then taking a pinch of ſnuff out of my monk's little horn box—And how would thy meek and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1269300201:232"/>
courteous ſpirit, my dear monk! ſo temper'd to <hi>bear and forbear!</hi>—how ſweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor ſoul's complaint!</p>
            <p>The old French officer ſeeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apoſtrophe, took the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to aſk me what was the matter—I told him the ſtory in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</p>
            <p>By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which are generally unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knife—The German look'd back coolly,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1269300201:233"/>
and told him he was welcome if he could reach it.</p>
            <p>An injury ſharpened by an inſult, be it to who it will, makes every man of ſentiment a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redreſſed it.—The old French officer did it with much leſs confuſion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a centinel, and pointing at the ſame time with his finger to the diſtreſs—the centinel made his way up to it.—There was no occaſion to tell the grievance—the thing told itſelf; ſo thruſting back the German inſtantly with his muſket—he took the poor dwarf by the hand, and placed him
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1269300201:234"/>
before him.—This is noble! ſaid I, clapping my hands together—And yet you would not permit this, ſaid the old officer, in England.</p>
            <p>—In England, dear Sir, ſaid I, <hi>we ſit all at our eaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old French officer would have ſet me at unity with myſelf, in caſe I had been at variance,—by ſaying it was a <hi>bon mot</hi>—and as a <hi>bon mot</hi> is always worth ſomething at Paris, he offered me a pinch of ſnuff.</p>

            <p>IT was now my turn to aſk the old French officer <q rend="inline">"What was the matter?"</q> for a cry of <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Hauſſez les mains, Monſieur l'Abbe,</hi>"</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echoed from a dozen different parts of the parterre, was as unintellgible to me, as my apoſtrophe to the monk had been to him.</p>
            <p>He told me, it was ſome poor Abbe in one of the upper loges, who he ſuppoſed had got planted perdu behind a couple of griſſets in

order to ſee the opera, and that the parterre eſpying him, were inſiſting upon his holding up both his hands during the repreſentation.—And can it be ſuppoſed, ſaid I, that an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick would pick the Griffer's pockets? The old French officer ſmiled, and whiſpering in my car, open'd a door of knowledge which I had no idea of—</p>
            <p>Good God! ſaid I, turning pale with aſtoniſhment—is it poſſible, that a people ſo ſmit with ſentiment ſhould at the ſame time be ſo unclean, and ſo unlike themſelves—<hi>Quelle groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſierte!</hi> added I.</p>

The French officer told me, it was an illiberal ſarcaſm at the church, which had begun in the theatre about the time the Tartuffe was given in it, by Moliere—but, like other remains oſ Gothic manners, was declining—Every nation, continued he, have their refinements and <hi>groſſiertes,</hi> in which they take the lead, and loſe it of one another by turns—that he had been in moſt countries, but never in one where he found not ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, which others ſeemed to want. <hi>Le</hi> POUR, <hi>et le</hi> CONTRE <hi>ſe trouvent en chaque nation;</hi> there is a balance, ſaid he, of good and bad every where; and nothing but the knowing it is ſo can emancipate one half of the world
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1269300201:240"/>
from the prepoſſeſſions which it holds againſt the other—that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of travel, as it regarded the <hi>ſça<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir vivre,</hi> was by ſeeing a great deal both of men and manners; it taught us mutual toleration; and mutual toleration, concluded he, making me a bow, taught us mutual love.</p>
            <p>The old French officer delivered this with an air of ſuch candour and good ſenſe, as coincided with my firſt favourable impreſſions of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—I thought I loved the man; but I fear I miſtook the object—'twas my own way of thinking—the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was, I could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it half ſo well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1269300201:241"/>
It is alike troubleſome to both the rider and his beaſt—if the latter goes pricking up his ears, and ſtarting all the way at every object which he never ſaw before—I have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive; and yet I honeſtly confeſs, that many a thing gave me pain, and that I bluſh'd at many a word the firſt month—which I found inconſequent and perfectly innocent the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Madame de Ramboulict, after an acquaintance of about ſix weeks with her, had done me the honour to take me in her coach about two leagues out of town—Of all women, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Rambouliet is the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; and I never wiſh to ſee one of
