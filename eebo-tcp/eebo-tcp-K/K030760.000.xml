            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN the members of the Medical Society, on the day of my delivering this Oration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, did me the honor to requeſt its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I conſidered the requeſt as a complimentary cuſtom uſual on that occaſion, and as ſuch received it; however, on a ſecond and third application, by order of their Council, amongſt whom freedom of debate on any ſubject is expected, and all compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ceremony incompatible with their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in that department, I was induced to believe that they might have perceived ſome hints, at leaſt, not unworthy further conſideration; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0517801100:3"/>I had at firſt aſked permiſſion to make ſuch additions, as to me appeared requiſite, on find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would be infinitely too diffuſive for a work of this nature, and as I could claim protection only by adhering ſtrictly to thoſe ſentiments and opinions which were to them delivered, and upon which they could alone found a wiſh for my making them more public; in that ſtate I now offer them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration, reſerving the elucidation of ſeveral parts for ſome future occaſion, as they form the baſis of a larger work, which I have an intention of completing as I can find opportunity.</p>
            <p>Should therefore the following ſheets, which now make their appearance to the world, in compliance with the deſire of the Medical Society, fortunately add the ſlighteſt ray of conſequence to that collective Body, and afford the candid Reader ſatisfaction, my labor will be amply compenſated; particularly as,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0517801100:4"/>at the ſame time, it will evince the deference I pay to the Impartiality — Judgement — and Abilities of ſeveral Members of that inſtitution—as well as the ſenſe of that duty I owe to the Community in general.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen, and Fellow-Aſſociates!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I conſider this inſtitution formed on the broad baſis of univerſal good, the parent of general utility, not of ſelfiſh oſtentation; and as this, with its ſiſter kingdoms, may be juſtly ſtiled the emporium of medical knowledge, where many of its members, the brighteſt luminaries of the Hippocratic ſchool, have not diſdained to convey their diſcoveries to the world in the common language of this country — a language, if not eſteemed ſo conciſe and elegant, yet full as comprehenſive, <hi>full</hi> as replete with deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0517801100:7"/>powers, as any of which Greece or Rome could ever boaſt; and as it muſt be allowed, that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in any art ought to be delivered in modes diveſted of all ambiguity and embarraſſment, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, conſidering our own vernacular language poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of theſe advantages, as being the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to a very great majority of this audience, <hi>though learned,</hi> before which I have the honor to preſent myſelf, and perfectly underſtood by all — it will not, I hope, be conſtrued want of reſpect, or a careleſs inattention to the conſequence and dignity ever annexed to profeſſional bodies thus aſſociated, that I have preſumed to deviate from ſome of my predeceſſors, dropping the tinſelled trappings of Roman grace, for the plain, but more uſeful orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Engliſh perſpicuity; and making uſe of a vehicle, eaſy, as common, to communicate my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, in order that I might, through the whole of them, be readily followed, and not in any part miſunderſtood.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0517801100:8"/>
            <p>For however familiar may be the Latin idiom to readers converſant in that language — however eaſy to comprehend in its niceſt points — to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, not conſtantly habituated to that ſtyle of delivery, the familiarity, and ready comprehenſion, would be defective.</p>
            <p>On theſe conſiderations I found ſome ſmall claim to your approbation; and, conſidering the arduouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent undertaking, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall ſtill farther experience your indulgence. Unimpreſſed with this idea, inſurmountable indeed would have been the difficulties which preſented themſelves to my reflection; but conſcious that liberality of ſentiment, with men of erudition, directs the judgement, and ſoftens the ſeverity of criticiſm, every obſtacle vaniſhed, and diffidence gave way to duty. For it has ever been, <hi>with me,</hi> a fixed principle, and laid down as a law immutable; That, as every individual in the medical hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere is ſo cloſely, and ſo neceſſarily united to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0517801100:9"/>welfare of mankind, he is bound by the ſtrongeſt ties, natural and ſocial, to exert his abilities, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weak, when called to promote any laudable purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Connected therefore as I am with the members of this medical inſtitution — <hi>with you,</hi> who actuated by philanthropy, make ſcience the pleaſurable labour of your lives — and that part of ſcience your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtudy, the moſt noble which can engage the purſuit of man — framed by Divine Wiſdom for the relief and preſervation of the human ſpecies — preventing, mitigating, and ſubduing many of their corporal calamities — your wiſhes I conſidered as a mandate — and, as you have thought proper to elect me to this office of honor — an office, which would have been far better ſupplied by many of your aſſociates — It became me, therefore, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, what there was in my power to offer, which might in ſome, though perhaps too ſmall a degree, compenſate for your loſs of time and attention to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0517801100:10"/>the conſequential avocation of your profeſſion, which candour would ſubject you to on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Converſant as you are with, aſſiduouſly engaged in, the acquiſition of medical knowledge, and happy in the promulgation, <hi>two points</hi> fell only to my elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; either to furniſh <hi>ſomething new,</hi> for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement: or <hi>ſomething</hi> to clear what might retard and clog the progreſs of the healing art.</p>
            <p>Of the former, I fear, I have little to lay before you worthy of your attention; even vanity cannot ſuggeſt to, or perſuade, me, that any thing has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to my obſervation, with which you may not, perhaps, have been long acquainted — My ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions muſt therefore, in a great meaſure, be confined to the latter; wherein I ſhall only preſume to offer ſome hints, which taken into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuperior abilities, may aſſiſt, ſo am I led to hope, in extending our particular art to that goal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0517801100:11"/>of perfection, at which human exertions are limited only to arrive.</p>
            <p>And, as many obſtacles have been thrown in the way, which have prevented us from riſing to that achme, as much as human endeavours, united with ſtrong mental powers and indefatigable aſſiduity, judiciouſly conducted, would have accompliſhed; the greateſt of which has been the thirſt after theoretic knowledge — it might appear neceſſary to take a ſurvey of the progreſs of the medic art, from the time of the divine old man, the firſt founder of ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematic phyſic, to the preſent aera, in which ſome poſſeſs <hi>no leſs merited, no leſs exalted characters.</hi> But to an audience like this, ſo well verſed in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of phyſic, and all its branches, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be conſidered, a work of preſumption and ſupererogation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only, as it is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with my ſubject, take a conciſe view of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0517801100:12"/>means by which HIPPOCRATES acquired his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, extenſive as it was, conſidering the period in which he lived — in the ſame manner, ſhew how his ſucceſſors rather retarded than promoted the utility of the Aeſculapian Art, particularly as ſome of our Profeſſors ſteer not altogether clear of ſimilar errors; and then attempt to point out, where ſome of our preſent modes require the aid of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>HIPPOCRATES enriched his mind from obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and founded his practice on facts, ſimply as they appeared to him; who being bleſt with <hi>quick</hi> perception, <hi>nice</hi> diſcrimination, and <hi>profound</hi> ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, made ſuch diſcoveries — deduced ſuch certain conſequences — and raiſed his ſuperſtructures on ſo ſolid a foundation, that he left behind him <hi>ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous</hi> monuments of great abilities;—<hi>Abilities,</hi> ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to his predeceſſors, and cotemporaries, that future ages purſued with avidity, and retained with confidence, many documents framed <hi>in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0517801100:13"/>of his art — and happy had it been for later times, had his plan, ſimple and eaſy as it was, been religiouſly obſerved. But, alas! <hi>Man,</hi> as if uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his own weakneſs, <hi>vain enough</hi> to ſuppoſe he could diſcover the <hi>arcana naturae</hi> — inveſtigate firſt cauſes — and carry his curious eye into the darkeſt labyrinths, began to prefer ingenuity to obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and mounted on the wings of falſe fame, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded the humble paths of modeſt inquiry, and built on vain and conjectural hypotheſis;—and what the reſult? Theory aroſe after theory; and each ſucceeding one, though it corrected the errors of that which had been before adopted, ſtill, like its predeceſſor, ſunk into oblivion; leaving behind few remains worthy of practical purſuit.—</p>
            <p>Nor is it difficult to account for the cauſe, why ſuch different conſequences awaited theſe different modes.</p>
            <p>HIPPOCRATES, it is ſaid, by the moſt rigid obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every action and motion of nature, of <hi>things
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0517801100:14"/>which did in reality exiſt,</hi> acquired a wonderful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the genuine diſpoſition of Diſeaſes; and by carefully comparing the ſame ſort of diſtempers, and their various minute motions in different Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and <hi>all</hi> the circumſtances and accidents, which uſually preceded, and attended them; he could readily foretel an approaching malady, and after its invaſion give a right judgement of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and event.</p>
            <p>As Nature terminated diſeaſes, when left to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he obſerved her mode, <hi>firſt</hi> tracing the manner in which the ſymptoms, in thoſe that were acute, ſucceeded one another; hence aroſe his art of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging, and thus he formed his method of curing them, by imitating Nature when ſhe proved herſelf defective.—From theſe obſervations, he diſcovered the uſe of <hi>Bleeding—Scarifications—Iſſues—Setons,</hi> where, in ſimilar complaints, Nature ſupplied HAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORRHAGES, and ABSCESSES—<hi>Artificial Diarrhoeas, —Sudorifics—Emetics—Diaphoretics—Diuretics,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0517801100:15"/>he found ſhe, by ſome of theſe means, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the conſtitution under particular circumſtances: hence then he became her humble imitator, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, that ſhe alone was the moſt judicious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectreſs.</p>
            <p>But the Theoriſts, forming of themſelves a ſet of principles, PRINCIPLES, <hi>the mere coinage of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered reaſon,</hi> from them deduced all their arguments, ſupported all their practice, and endeavoured to prove Nature obedient to laws ſo founded.</p>
            <p>Hence the incongruous, elementary, atomical ſyſtems of <hi>ſucceeding Sects</hi> — hence the conceits of an <hi>Helmont</hi> — the whimſicalities of a <hi>Paracelſus</hi> — hence a variety of <hi>chemical chimaeras,</hi> and all the inconſiſtencies of <hi>hydraulic,</hi> and <hi>mechanic ſubtlety;</hi> and <hi>hence</hi> fell medicine into ſhameful diſrepute, it becoming more the pride of cavilling ſcepticiſm, and ſcholaſtic vanity, to build ingenious, though fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious doctrines, than after detecting error, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0517801100:16"/>to purſue Nature through her plain and humble paths.</p>
            <p>And it appears aſtoniſhing to a reflecting mind, that notions ſo ridiculous, practices ſo abſurd, ſhould be countenanced in later times; when it is known, that <hi>all</hi> the labours of the ancients, as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, are chiefly valuable for the ſimple recitals they contain, <hi>founded</hi> on obſervation, <hi>collected</hi> from appearances, and <hi>delivered</hi> with candour: hence the praeeminence of an <hi>Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Trallian, Aurelianus, Celſus, Tulpius, Lommius, Morgagni, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham,</hi> and ſome others of more modern date; whom to mention, might be conſidered as indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and the reſult of adulation.</p>
            <p>And indeed this ſimplicity, the more it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, the more ſtrongly it convinces us of its uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; affording the moſt certain, perhaps the only proper, method of acquiring, and communicating medical information. For the theories of the preſent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0517801100:17"/>day, though fraught with no ſmall degree of plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, will not ſtand the teſt of critical inquiry; they <hi>all</hi> appear to be <hi>too generally</hi> applied, in fevers <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</hi> —Can we ſuppoſe, that in ſuch, as from their commencement to their termination are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with profuſe ſweating, or a moiſt ſoft ſkin, a conſtriction of the cuticular pores takes place?— In thoſe, where the circulation is languid—the action of the vaſcular ſyſtem torpid—the proſtration of ſtrength ſudden and extreme, that an <hi>active</hi> ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus is the cauſe?—Or, in thoſe where no oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, load, nauſea, ſickneſs at the ſtomach, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs in the inteſtines—no catarrhal or pulmonic affections manifeſt themſelves, that they deduce their origin from too copious and morbid ſecretion of the mucus in thoſe organs? Surely not. Yet, theſe, by different claſſes of practitioners, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the proximate cauſe of febrile affections, and applied in common to all.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0517801100:18"/>
            <p>But within theſe manſions, ſuch a theoretic caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethes appears not to be nurtured. If we examine the nature of the proceedings within theſe walls adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what is the roof, by which we are ſheltered, but that of an AEDES AESCULAPIANA? If we advert to the public product of your application, what are your memoirs, ſo juſtly enumerated amongſt the moſt valuable labours of the medic art, but the TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BULAE AENEAE TEMPLORUM, ornamented by ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and ſupported by truth.<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be obſerved, that, at this period, the Author had not ſent any papers on medical ſubjects to the Society.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need we take up much time in furniſhing proofs of the ſuperiority of ſuch a ſcheme over every other, which has been produced by the fertility of human invention.</p>
            <p>View but our Engliſh Hippocrates, SYDENHAM; he, by recalling this mode, not only contended with, but conquered, a theoretic world, notwithſtanding
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0517801100:19"/>the powerful oppoſition he met with, invidious, as violent; and we find his deſcriptions ſtand at this hour unſhaken, nor can be overthrown but by the hand of Heaven, when medicine ſhall be no more. So firmly ſupported are they by unerring truth; ſo ſimply, yet ſo juſtly, are they delivered; that they are to all intelligible — by all valued — by all quoted: even thoſe, who, wild with hypotheſis, leave nothing behind them but reliques ſimilar to theſe, which can attract our attention, or merit our obſervation.</p>
            <p>Still, notwithſtanding we are convinced of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>captive notions by which ſome of our early prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors were governed — notwithſtanding we can view the efforts of our cotemporaries not perfectly conſiſtent in the application of their ſpeculative opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions — notwithſtanding the advantages, unknown to former ages, which daily are preſented in every branch of medical philoſophy; which are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by ſlight obſervation, and may be truly arranged
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0517801100:20"/>with the <hi>cauſae evidentes.</hi> We avail not ourſelves of theſe advantages, or apply them ſufficiently, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our modus medendi as perfect as it might be.</p>
            <p>There is too great, too general a ſolicitude in ſearching after SPECIFICS, and inquiring into the nature of the ſemina morbi, as if the former did exiſt—or the latter were within the reach of human inveſtigation. We ſeem to be more anxious about the AGENTIA MIRIFICA, than the AGENDA, as if the latter were completely underſtood; that they were is devoutly to be wiſhed; for they come more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially under our conſideration; at leaſt it appears to me a truth irrefragable, that were we to pay the ſtricteſt attention to the conſtitution, ſtudy more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely its parts, dependencies, moving powers and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities, practice would be diveſted of many errors, with which it too unfortunately at preſent abounds.</p>
            <p>However, that we may be enabled to prove the validity of this aſſertion, we ſhall attempt to ſhew
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0517801100:21"/>THE FALLACY OF THE FIRST OF THESE PURSUITS— THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DEMONSTRATING THE NATURE OF THE SECOND, IN GENERAL — and, THE REAL UTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITY OF ATTENDING CLOSELY TO THE THIRD, AND ITS MODE OF BEING APPLIED, in order to add to the improvement of the Art.</p>
            <p>And, FIRST,</p>
            <p>No idea, perhaps, has done more real injury, than <hi>that of Medicines acting ſpecifically in conquering Diſeaſes</hi>—Of this truth, a very ſuperficial examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will convince us: for it retards our reſearches in inveſtigating their full and true powers — it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us, conſequently, from extending thoſe powers ſo as to be as diffuſively uſeful as they might — it lays the foundation for a thouſand deceptions; cauſing us to attribute particular conſequences to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, which do not from thence, in reality, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and keeping their true ſource hid from our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation —nor is this all; it does worſe — it often, by occaſioning delay, increaſes the malady, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0517801100:22"/>thus conſidered, are pretended to ſubdue, nay frequently generating diſorders of a more delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nature; overturning that firſt and ſalutary caution, which directs us in all our efforts, if we fail to do good, to do no harm.—<q>"Is artis medicae ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus eſt; ut hominem a <hi>tot gravibus malis</hi> liberet; ideoque Medicus <hi>nullo modo</hi> nocere, nedum Vitam deſtruere, aut Sanitatem laedere debet, utpote quum <hi>Medicina</hi> non <hi>nocendi,</hi> ſed <hi>juvandi,</hi> ſit Scientia."</q> HOFFMANNUS.</p>
            <p>Indeed the miſchief ceaſes not here; it proves detrimental in another view; for it places the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Philoſopher, and Phyſician, on a footing with the impudent and ignorant Empiric, and too often throws ſuch an odium on the Art itſelf, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the firſt eminence are frequently held in contempt, and treated with ridicule, by the injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and illiterate, who fly with confidence to the cabinet, and depend upon the preſuming arrogance of every plundering impoſtor.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0517801100:23"/>
            <p>Still, ſtrange as may be the appearance, painful the reflection to an informed mind, why ſhould it be matter of ſurprize? Do not the Phyſician and Medicaſter too often aſſign the ſame reaſon for their ſucceſs, THE SPECIFIC POWER OF THEIR APPLIED AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIDOTE, and build on the ſame fortuitous exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And under ſuch circumſtances, the modeſt diffidence of the one can never, with the million, ſtand againſt the bold buſtling ignorance of the other—for men of weak diſcriminating powers, of which <hi>nine tenths</hi> of mankind conſiſt, at leaſt if we confine them to medical underſtanding, will give credit to the opinions of creatures of their own level, and place, as Indians with their painted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, confidence in, and pay large tribute to, things their folly and ſuperſtition have ſet up.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the credulity in this point of many profeſſors of the art, <hi>Men</hi> held in the higheſt eſtimation adopting ſuch ideas, handing them down to poſterity, and having them received by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0517801100:24"/>generations—is it not ſingular, that not <hi>one</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific has ever yet been diſcovered, out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which have acquired the appellation?</p>
            <p>It has been, and is now, by ſome, thought due to the Bark in an intermittent fever—to Quickſilver and its preparations in the Syphilis; but in reality, even theſe merit no ſuch diſtinction: for let us aſk, Do they in all caſes, as if poſſeſſed of ſpecific power they would, become infallible? Or, will they by any means prevent the acceſſion of theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? Practice proves the contrary; for they will not alone always cure theſe complaints—and men have been ſeized with intermittents whilſt under a courſe of Bark—and the lues venerea with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiated habit.</p>
            <p>As well might modeſty and judgement be united to the names of <hi>M</hi>*******, <hi>G</hi>******, or <hi>any other empirical depredators</hi> with which this metropolis is loaded; as well might infallibility be added to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0517801100:25"/>every noſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, as ſpecific powers in curing diſeaſes, <hi>in all conſtitutions,</hi> to any medicine.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we ſearch into the practice of men highly elevated in their profeſſion, who retain ſuch a ſpecies of abſurd faith, we ſhall find ſuch glaring contradictions—circumſtances militating ſo diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally againſt, and ſo totally ſubverſive of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that we muſt be convinced of the fallibility of ſuch a dogma.</p>
            <p>For it is not uncommon to have accounts pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by ſome of the efficacy of a medicine in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain complaints, which cures, they tell us, SPECIFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CALLY, to which are tacked a long catalogue of caſes in proof; whilſt at the ſame time, in the hands of others of equal eminence, tried under ſimilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, no ſuch ſurprizing effects are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Need I, to what I have already mentioned, add the accounts of <hi>arſenic, hemlock, deadly night-ſhade, henbane, flores cardamines, flores zinci, foſſile</hi> alkali,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0517801100:26"/>and ſome others, which have been foiſted upon the world under ſuch a pretence? All having work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miracles under the direction of ſome, whilſt others have failed in the adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>To what are we to attribute this diverſification? Can we diſpute the abilities of the authors? It would be conſidered preſumptuous.—Can we doubt their veracity? It would be thought illiberal.—Dare we think they are attempting to acquire ſame from falſe principles? It would be conſtrued invidious.</p>
            <p>What are we to conjecture? Certainly that no ſuch ſpecifics exiſt; and that thoſe who were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of ſuch an opinion, unwilling, or unable to purſue their reſearches, were happy in having ſo eaſy a ſupport to reſt upon; or, uninclined to leſſen their conſequence, by receding from ſentiments once adopted, and publicly ſanctioned by their fiat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to ſuffer ſcience to be cloathed in an unintelligible jargon, and lead men, credulous as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0517801100:27"/>themſelves, to believe it was impoſſible to proceed farther, pleaſed as well with the phantom, as the reality of knowledge. Hence was a check given to particular inquiries, by implicit confidence being paid to hoary-headed obſtinacy, I had almoſt ſaid, cunning, creeping under the cloak of falſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: hence was the healing art impeded in its progreſs by ſuch a belief; and hence a few charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters called great, made thouſands appear little, and live in the ſhade of indolence and obſcurity.</p>
            <p>Examine but the works of <hi>Galen, Diaſcorides, Oribaſius, Meſſuë, Boerhaave,</hi> and almoſt all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Materia Medica of former ages, and compare them, with what has been written by ſome of the lateſt authors, who have made real experience the teſt of their opinions, you will find, that a multiplicity of errors, from time to time, have been tranſmitted from one to another, forming a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible farrago of ſpecific abſurdities.—View but the imaginary powers beſtowed on BEZOAR and SAF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FRON,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0517801100:28"/>two out of the numberleſs inſtances, which might be produced. What mighty virtues have not been attributed to the former, by men renowned for medical ſagacity? So multifarious, ſo efficacious, that almoſt all powerful medicines, or, thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined ſuch, were called Bezoardics; and what from faithful experiment is it now proved? one of our moſt imperfect abſorbents.</p>
            <p>What has not been ſaid of Saffron? Receiving for its ſuppoſed amazing ſpecific powers, the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous names, <hi>Aroma Philoſophorum—ſanguis Herculis— Rex vegetabilium—Panacea vegetabilis—hortus Laetitiae— medicina Triſtitiae</hi>—and many more, given in ſmall quantities. Indeed the great BOERHAAVE conſiders a few drops of the extract of Saffron, inſpiſſated only to the conſiſtence of oil, and taken in a glaſs of rich wine, as highly exhilarant and cordial. How different from the experience of this day! for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in very large doſes, ſaffron is not known to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0517801100:29"/>produce any effects, and of theſe accounts are very rare and doubtful.</p>
            <p>But as an apology for this credulity, might it not be called fanaticiſm? It has been aſſerted, that the means, by which medicines produced their effects, at leaſt thoſe to which were attributed a ſpecific power, were impoſſible to be detected and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; and indeed the ſame notion is too prevalent at this day, in many caſes. To ſuch a height is it carried, that an <hi>arcanum ſcrophuloſum</hi> has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>even</hi> to the members of <hi>this</hi> Society; ſo fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant is folly in her attempts, yet meets, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with ſuch enormous encouragement; and, though aſſociated with ignorance, and ſupported by preſumption, is ſo ſucceſsful, it is no wonder that crude inexperience ſhould be led to conclude he might palm his noſtrum on this Inſtitution; for great medic characters, ſo called at this time, we have ſeen ſwell the catalogues, and enrich the liſts of great Impoſtors.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0517801100:30"/>
            <p>However, to prove the fallacy of this opinion, let us examine one medicine, which has long been held replete with ſpecific power, and which claims more the title, could ſuch be allowed, than any other medicine with which we are acquainted, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Quickſilver; we ſhall by that means detect the errors accruing from ſuch an idea, and perceive the benefits ariſing from the diſcovery of its true action —Benefits, which ſhould ſtimulate us in all caſes to ſimilar inquiries: I mean the BARK.</p>
            <p>This was long conſidered to cure Intermittents <hi>ſpecifically</hi>—that is, we know not how—by ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent inexplicable power; and indeed ſuch was the confidence placed in this miraculous drug, ſo thought, incomprehenſible as aſtoniſhing, that in caſes of this kind, it was indiſcriminately exhibited—though very often productive of great miſchief—till from long continued, and often repeated trials, ſome of the more judicious obſervers found, that this ſpecific power was not always in Intermittents an inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0517801100:31"/>much leſs a certain curative agent, not even of the ſame complaint at different times in the ſame perſon: hence it became neceſſary to inquire, from whence this deviation aroſe, and in which ſtate of the complaint it might be productive of the greateſt ſucceſs; and it appeared to be when the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been harraſſed, and the vaſcular ſyſtem ſo far oppreſſed, as to be debilitated by the preceding malady, or was, <hi>ab initio,</hi> in that ſtate—For given at firſt, when the conſtitution was in full vigor, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced very dangerous effects, converting quotidians, and tertians, into continued Fevers, aggravating, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of alleviating the febrile ſymptoms, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a variety of other diſtreſſing conſequences.</p>
            <p>On conſidering theſe phaenomena, it was manifeſt, that what was thought its ſpecific power, depended upon ſome exertion which occaſioned the ſyſtem to act, under ſome circumſtances, with too much force, by increaſing the vaſcular tone.—Hence men, imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing this idea, laboured to abate the activity of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0517801100:32"/>conſtitution, by bleeding, purging, &amp;c.—or ſuffered it to be weakened by delay, before they exhibited this medicine, which was then almoſt always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, unleſs prevented by ſome conſtitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that at the ſame time required for its allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or ſubduction ſome attention.</p>
            <p>It appears therefore obvious, that the virtue of this medicine lay not in its correcting or deſtroying the miaſma, or virus, producing the Intermittent, but in the exertion of its tonic power; hence a peculiar ſtate of the conſtitution was neceſſary,—and hence the neceſſity of knowing that ſtate before we can promiſe ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the particular power of this <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally allowed ſpecific</hi> was developed, by obſervation and experience; and there remains no doubt of the Bark producing generally, I might have ſaid always, the diſagreeable, and ſometimes dangerous effects above ſpecified, if given too early, or perſiſted in—
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0517801100:33"/>without it brings on ſome debility at firſt, as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does, by becoming purgative: and it may be laid down as an invariable rule in practice, that where there is in the habit ſtrong vaſcular action, and an inflammatory diatheſis of the blood, which are, I take it, generally conjoined, Bark univerſally does harm, —where the contrary conſtitution is prevalent, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally good, if no topical defect impedes, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracts its action: nor does the Bark being ſucceſsful in ſome local inflammatory complaints, at all inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the force of the argument; for in thoſe caſes, the diſorder itſelf is not an active, but a paſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</p>
            <p>Similar arguments might be adduced to the ſame purpoſe, proving the known action of Quickſilver, and its ſaline compounds, capable of producing its good effects, inſtead of its imaginary <hi>ſpecific powers,</hi> and of ſome others. But what I have advanced will, I hope, prove ſufficiently ſatisfactory to ſhew, that by this idea of medicines acting ſpecifically, no ſmall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0517801100:34"/>impediment has been thrown in the way of medical improvement: for men, ſatisfied with this LUSUS, this LARVA RATIONIS, practiſed from principles falſely founded, nay, <hi>very often,</hi> without any principles at all —occaſioning great loſs of time, and not only doing miſchief by injudicious application, but keeping the extenſive powers of many active medicines immerſed in obſcurity. Hence, thoſe formerly adminiſtered in one malady only, to which their <hi>ſpecific power</hi> was ſuppoſed to be ſingularly adapted, we now find, their modes of action being brought to light, in a variety of others extremely uſeful and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</p>
            <p>Yet it is very extraordinary, that men flying from inquiries after properties it may be in their power to diſcover, ſhould ruſh forward in purſuit of what lies far beyond their reach, the NATURE OF THE SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINA MORBI, the ſecond point appropriated for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0517801100:35"/>
            <p>That ſuch an attempt ſhould be made in the early periods of an art, while the profeſſors were almoſt totally ignorant of the nature of the human ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, with regard to its moving powers, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathic affections—knew little of the animal oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my—of what different parts the body was formed; how they were actuated by each other, and by what laws they were governed—at a time when philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy was ſearching after the Principia Rerum, is not to be wondered at.</p>
            <p>But, conſidering this inquiry has been ſet on foot ever ſince the prevalence of Hippocrates' idea of the <q>"<hi>Calidum</hi> &amp; <hi>ſalſum;</hi>—<hi>Calidum</hi> &amp; <hi>acidum;</hi>—<hi>Calidum</hi> &amp; <hi>amarum,</hi> &amp; <hi>alia innumerabilia:"</hi>
               </q> a period of above two thouſand years, and has ever continued in the ſame point of uncertainty. Is it not ſurprizing then, that men ſhould for ages perplex themſelves in the attempt to make diſcoveries, ſo much above the power of human underſtanding?—that they ſhould vainly diſſipate their time in endeavouring to detect
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0517801100:36"/>the component parts of materials, which are in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral too minute to be collected—in all, too ſubtle to come within the limits of man's ſcrutinizing abilities?</p>
            <p>Knowing theſe things, is it not ſtill more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to hear men talk of the acidity and alkaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the materies morbi; and otherwiſe ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the particular nature of the acrimony, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of eruptive complaints? to aſſert poſitively, that the venereal virus is an alkali, and propoſe to cure diſorders from that cauſe with muriatic acid, traverſing through all the diverſified mazes of the human body, and there making neutral ſalts by the ſpecific combinations?</p>
            <p>Yet, ridiculous as is this attempt; fantaſtic this enthuſiaſm, ſome modern anatomiſts hold up the certainty of ſuch diſcoveries, and form from thence ſchemes of practice, curable and infallible, implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in young inexperienced minds, an IGNIS FATUUS, unprofitable as viſionary.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0517801100:37"/>
            <p>Let Philoſophers of ſuch a deſcription go in queſt of atoms, and the diverſified modification of matter, mount air balloons, ſeek medical knowledge in the clouds—<hi>Aſtra petant, quomodo formentur,</hi>—be it ours to inquire how the effects produced by matter, in its combined and morbid ſtate, are to be remedied, and to ſuch heated imaginations be the advice of CELSUS recommended.—<q>"Rationalem quidem puto medicinam eſſe debere; inſtrui verò ab evidenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus cauſis; obſcuris omnibus, non à cogitatione artificis, ſed ab ipſâ arte rejectis."</q>—Advice, ſo pregnant with unerring truth;—fraught with ſuch ſtrong conviction, that on this point it is needleſs to dwell any longer—the futility of ſuch inquiries—the impoſſibility of attaining the <hi>quid deſideratum,</hi> are ſo conſpicuouſly evident to the eye of common ſenſe, primâ facie, that they need no arguments to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in proof. For what underſtand we more of the particular nature of the virus creative of the Plague—Small Pox—Pemphigus—Cancer—than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0517801100:38"/>the firſt obſervers of theſe diſeaſes?—Virus, which might be examined, if any could, from the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the matter produced: but we, like them, form our judgement only from the effects.</p>
            <p>It will be more to our purpoſe to examine how much greater benefit will be derived to mankind, by paying attention to that, upon which, to be of any ſervice, our applications muſt act; for certainly the <hi>human machine itſelf</hi> is the grand object of the Phyſician's conſideration; and the <hi>moving powers</hi> of that inſtrument, with what I ſhall, for the preſent, call their <hi>appendiculae,</hi> the things which require his attention, and which being too much neglected in our deſcriptions of caſes, has retarded, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards the progreſs of the healing art.</p>
            <p>By THE MOVING POWERS, I mean <hi>the muſcular Fibres</hi> and <hi>vaſcular Syſtem poſſeſſed of Irritability</hi>— the <hi>nervous Syſtem of Incitability</hi>— and <hi>the ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0517801100:39"/>maſs of Fluids, of the Vis animans &amp; ſervans Naturam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the APPENDICULAE, the <hi>Lungs, Stomach, Inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Uterus, Kidneys,</hi> &amp;c. parts which, affected, have ſome influence on the moving powers, with reſpect to their action. The <hi>Brain,</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> I include in the nervous and vaſcular ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>By the incitability, as applied to the nerves, I would be underſtood that power which is capable of being put into action by immateriality, ſuch as mental affection—ſympathy; though it may be put into motion by material ſtimulus; to which Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, <hi>itſelf abſtractedly conſidered,</hi> is only obedient; though that may be alſo rouzed by the connection of parts, wherein it reſides, with the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, and by means of the nerves thus put into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſupported.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0517801100:40"/>
            <p>But, in order to form a proper idea of what I mean for your conſideration, I muſt beg leave to take a ſurvey of the machine, according to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, in the enjoyment of perfect health.</p>
            <p>Now in this caſe, the principles of which it is formed, muſt be in a ſtate exactly, or pretty nearly proportioned to each other; ſo that one may aſſiſt in promoting and ſupporting the vigor of the other, and producing thoſe effects with eaſe, and conſtancy for which they were ordained.</p>
            <p>The moving ſolids of the human machine muſt have ſuch firmneſs, pliability, and elaſticity, as to enable them to anſwer to the impulſe of the given Irritability.</p>
            <p>The Irritability of ſuch a nature as to be kept in action by the nervous incitability.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0517801100:41"/>
            <p>The nerves to be ſo formed, as perpetually to ſupply their power, when and where wanted, with regularity.</p>
            <p>The blood and fluids in ſuch quantity, and of ſuch conſiſtency, as to receive the vis animans, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and transfuſe it through the whole ſyſtem in an invariable current—and ſo bland, that they may produce no defect in the ſecretory or excretory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, ſo as to impede them in their duty.</p>
            <p>And the Appendiculae, ſo complete in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they may perform their actions to which they are allotted, with conſtancy and freedom.</p>
            <p>While matters are thus conducted, the machine remains in perfect health; but if a defect ariſes in one or more of theſe particulars, diſeaſes ſucceed in proportion to the magnitude of the defect—and of different natures, agreeable to the parts affected, and their connections, and the changes brought on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0517801100:42"/>in them, which may be either partial or general, or idiopathic or ſymptomatic; and the cauſe of ſuch defect will ariſe from the imperfections, in ſome of the ſources, from whence the active powers deduce their origin, immediately or ſecondarily. And as we conclude, that the ſources of all activity, are either the brain, medulla ſpinalis, heart, or blood— ſo in ſome of theſe we ſhall find ſomething contrary to a ſtate of nature, in its moſt perfect form; or a derangement in ſome of the appendiculae, by which theſe ſources are diſordered.</p>
            <p>But that I may be more perfectly underſtood, I ſhall treſpaſs only a very little on your patience, to ſupply two or three ſhort, though common, caſes, by way of elucidation.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe <hi>a man of ſtrong ſtamina—great vaſcular irritability—ſtrong equable nervous incitability, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with blood, copious and tenacious,</hi> has perſpiration obſtructed by what is called CATCHING COLD. We
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0517801100:43"/>are all acquainted with the general reſult. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ought to paſs off by the perſpirable pores, is retained in the habit; the vaſcular ſyſtem expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences a plenitude—a quick circulation is produced— Irritability increaſed—and febrile ſymptoms ſucceed: here the immediate ſource lies in the heart, and vaſcular ſyſtem, excited by a ſtimulus from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional cauſe, conſtriction of the cuticular pores; and that by the more remote, the application of cold;—and if there ſhould be in ſuch a conſtitution, any defect in the brain, lungs, &amp;c. or any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal organ, or part, a topical affection will be the conſequence of the inflammatory kind, which will increaſe and ſupport the fever; or ſhould any of the organs be affected in the firſt inſtance, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will occaſion the ſame effect; and this ariſes alſo from the ſource above ſpecified.</p>
            <p>But ſhould the remote cauſe operate on one, <hi>of a weak—relaxed habit—poſſeſſed of quick nervous incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but a ſmall portion of vaſcular irritability, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0517801100:44"/>a thin ſate of fluids, with a paucity of blood;</hi> the conſequences will not be ſo violent—The febrile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will be of the ſlow kind, attended with more nervous ſymptoms, the pulſe will be quick, but languid; the heat in a ſmall degree increaſed, but not ſo permanent, accompanied by ſpaſms of various parts; depreſſion or ſinking of the ſpirits, and ſeldom any topical inflammation—here then the nervous ſyſtem will be more affected, diſcovered by the languor of the moving powers, load, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of the head, coldneſs of the extremities, and ſuch other ſymptoms, as indicate THE SOURCE OF MOTION, <hi>the nervous Syſtem,</hi> the part oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe, laſtly, <hi>a Man of good ſtamina, with a weak vaſcular Irritability,</hi> tho' <hi>ſteady, nervous Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability,</hi> and <hi>Blood of a tolerable denſity,</hi> and <hi>in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantity,</hi> under the preſent circumſtances—what will from thence occur?</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0517801100:45"/>
            <p>The circulation of the Blood will not be ſo greatly accelerated, as in the firſt inſtance—the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities will be cold—the perſpiration obſtructed, though not in ſo great a degree—uneaſy ſenſations of coldneſs, and heavineſs of the head—diſturbed and reſtleſs nights—oppreſſions on the praecordia— chillneſs, and fluſhings of heat not continued, or regular—dejection of ſpirits—and affections, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what approaching to delirium.</p>
            <p>Thus we find, from the <hi>ſame immediate cauſe,</hi> different effects will be produced; and they may be varied, as the different combinations in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution happen—and we muſt to this add, as the blood and fluids are in ſuch a particular ſtate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the vis animans more or leſs copiouſly, or to transfuſe it more or leſs freely, the effects may be increaſed or diminiſhed in a proportionate degree— or as it may be, more or leſs acrimonious, for acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony always adds a ſtimulus, particularly to the vaſcular ſyſtem. Though ſome may exert at the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0517801100:46"/>ſame time as a ſedative power on the nerves, and therefore the additional ſtimulus not be ſo percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we know that the inteſtines, lungs, liver, kidneys, bladder, uterus, &amp;c. have ſuch univerſal connections with the whole machine, particularly the two former, that they can in many inſtances tranſmit their affections ſympathetically to the whole, or ſome parts of the body which lie at a diſtance; hence then, as they are more or leſs affected, ſo will be the moving powers in adequate proportions: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which are obſervable in ſome ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, inflammatory, catarrhal, hectic, remittent, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minoſe fevers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, as is the nature of the moving powers; as are the different combinations; as is the ſtate of the fluids, with reſpect to their acrimony or blandneſs, texture, and capability of receiving and transfuſing the vis animans; as is the ſtate of the appendiculae
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0517801100:47"/>and muſcular ſtamina, ſo do conſtitutions vary, and ſo are different effects produced by ſimilar cauſes; which we ſee often occur in epidemic, and other complaints, where, though the leading ſymptoms may be ſimilar in a great degree, the concomitants will be different, and put on various appearances, as we find in the recitals of the ſame complaints by different authors: hence ariſe many of the ſpecies and varieties of different genera of diſeaſes; hence a deviation in our modus medendi, and hence the good effects of one medicine in ſome inſtances at one time, which produce no ſuch benefit at another, in complaints conſidered as ſimilar: and hence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, alſo ariſe the good or bad effects of the ſame medicine given in different doſes, and likewiſe the neceſſity of forming different combinations to make it act with certainty and ſucceſs in different conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, take a ſurvey of the effects of medicines in different doſes, or differently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0517801100:48"/>and ſee what concluſions we may from thence deduce.</p>
            <p>Opium, in full doſes, inſtead of proving anti-ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic, anodyne, or narcotic, has often created other diſtreſſing ſymptoms; and ſo far from taking off ſpaſms, alleviating pain, or procuring ſleep, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned nauſea, vertigo, and reſtleſſneſs, whilſt in ſmaller doſes it has procured every deſired purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Mercury alſo, given in a ſimilar manner with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the doſe, has alſo occaſioned diſagreeable conſequences, inſtead of affecting the ſalivary ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, its chief ſcene of action, producing nauſea, gripings, and bloody ſtools, whilſt in ſmaller doſes, it has readily been abſorbed into the habit, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually brought on a ptyaliſm, nay often cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perceptible effect.</p>
            <p>Under the ſame circumſtances, Bark has been the cauſe of ſickneſs, purging, and conſtantly rejected
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0517801100:49"/>by vomiting; producing not any of its ſalutary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, either by prolonging the apyrexy, or taking off the febrile affections, which have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by cold or hot infuſions of this medicine.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, ſmall doſes of theſe very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive materials have been productive of no ſenſible or curative effect ſometimes, whilſt adminiſtered in larger doſes, their good conſequences have been made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>And again: It is indiſputably true, that theſe medicines given in any quantity or form, they may, the moſt perfectly agreeable to the conſtitution, and without having any painful concomitant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attendant, have by ho means anſwered the deſired purpoſe; but being joined with other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, have proved ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>What then can be the cauſe of theſe deviations? Is it in the medical ingredient itſelf? Impoſſible—
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0517801100:50"/>For every medicine conſidered in itſelf, ceteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, muſt always be alike; its action muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably the ſame; and in ſimilar conſtitutions, or in the ſame conſtitutions under ſimilar circumſtances muſt univerſally produce the ſame effects.</p>
            <p>Though I am well aware it may be urged, that the ſame medicine in the ſame perſon has appeared to act, as if it varied its mode of action; this will be readily granted—but then it has been owing to ſome change brought upon the habits by illneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, or ſome other cauſe.</p>
            <p>For medicines producing in a ſtate of full health one effect, will create others in a ſtate of illneſs, with reſpect to the conſtitution; though the action of the medicine muſt be the ſame.—For the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution labouring under an indiſpoſition, its powers are altered, they act not under a ſtate of healthful nature, but require ſomething to relieve and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them—Now the ſame medicine which relieves,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0517801100:51"/>and regulates them, during the illneſs, would, when the illneſs was conquered, and the powers of the conſtitution returned to their natural order, or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, produce bad effects if continued, inaſmuch as the ſame action of a medicine in illneſs, producing the ſame effect on the habit, brings that habit into a ſtate of health by that very action; which action, the body being in an healthful ſtate, is too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for it then needing no ſuch aid, would have its powers too much increaſed, and by that means diſtreſs from that very ſource would be occaſioned. —The ſame argument may be made uſe of, where debilitating means have been applied, in order to reduce the too active powers of the habit, morbidly affected.</p>
            <p>From what has been advanced I conclude, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the cauſe of theſe deviations depend ſolely on the ſtate of the conſtitution, and by no means on the nature of the medicine.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0517801100:52"/>
            <p>Now, as I conſider the action of medicines, and the ſemina morbi, to be exactly under the ſame point of view, regarding their reſpective operations on the machine, and effects produced—I ſay, theſe depend totally on the nature of the conſtitution operated upon—for inſtance,</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Man of ſtrong ſtamina, great vaſcular irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſteady, regular, nervous incitability, firm texture of the blood,</hi> was to be ſeized with an intermittent fever, of the quotidian or tertian type, from marſh miaſma—in order to form his cure, the vaſcular ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritability muſt be abated, the too ſtrong tone of the ſolids, and muſcular fibres in ſome degree debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the coheſive power of the blood weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—by bleeding, purging, cooling, ſaline medicines, antimonial diaphoretics; — which done, the Bark might afterwards be adminiſtered. And if a man of a ſimilar conſtitution takes ſo large a quantity of heating ſtimulants as to produce the ſame febrile appearances, without intermiſſion — the treatment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0517801100:53"/>would be the ſame.—Not from the miaſmata, or ſtimulants, having produced theſe effects—but from the ſame conſtitutional cauſes.</p>
            <p>But was the marſh miaſma to affect a <hi>man of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated habit, weak nervous incitability, and enfeebled vaſcular irritability, with a looſe texture of the ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary maſs</hi>—cordial, nervous medicines with the uſe of bliſters might be added to the uſe of the Bark; and theſe would be required from conſtitutional cauſes alſo,—that the conſtitution itſelf might be rouzed to feel the tonic power of that remedy, and experience its good effects.</p>
            <p>A variety of other inſtances might be offered in proof of the ſame poſitions—and this mode of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will be found applicable to almoſt all caſes; particularly, all ſuch as are general in the habit, or are owing to general affections: and the more it is examined into, the more the propriety and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of paying particular attention to what has been
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0517801100:54"/>ſpecified will appear; but what has been ſaid will, I hope, be ſufficient to ſupply the propoſed hints, and lead me to my laſt propoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"<hi>That one preſent ſource of retarding the progreſs of the medic art, is the looſe and neglectful manner in which caſes and their modes of cure, or want of ſucceſs, are deſcribed.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>It has, I flatter myſelf, been clearly proved, as far as the time allotted upon this occaſion will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that the conſtitution, with its different diviſions, require the firſt attention of the Phyſician; and it will readily occur, that in practice it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not only collectively, but abſtractedly; that it ſhould be found out in what part the conſtitution is moſt defective, whether reſpecting its <hi>nervous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability— vaſcular Irritability — muſcular Strength — texture</hi> or <hi>compoſition of the Blood</hi>—and <hi>Fluids</hi>—and <hi>the Appendiculae.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0517801100:55"/>
            <p>For as all the parts act in combination with each other, as they tranſmit to each other the principle of their power, yet may experience ſeparate affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inherent in themſelves, which may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or partially communicated, creative of general or partial diſturbance — they ſhould always be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attended to: inaſmuch as the neglect of ſome, may occaſion too often our endeavours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abortive.</p>
            <p>But we find commonly too little ſaid on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent peculiarities of the conſtitution, upon which different medicines have been tried in ſimilar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, wherein they have ſometimes proved ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſometimes otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Now, as medicines act differently in different quantities—with different combinations—in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtitutions—in the ſame conſtitutions at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods — in the ſame diſeaſe at the different times of the malady, with regard to the good or bad
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0517801100:56"/>effects they produce — and as this apparent diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of action depends upon the different ſtates of the moving powers, and what I call their appendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae, the conſtitutional peculiarities ſhould always be nicely diſcriminated.</p>
            <p>This mode would often enable us to diſcover, on what account various remedies had been ſucceſsful; wherein they had failed, and direct us to the beſt method of ſelecting and combining medicines, and of curing diſeaſes, ſuch as fall immediately under the Phyſician's care; and aſſiſt, in moſt, to which the Surgeon lays claim, as little, very little is to be done with the ſemina morbi, and the ſpecific power of our remedies is merely ideal. For as is the ſtate of the moving powers and fluids, with their combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ſo will be the action of our medicines, and conſequently ſo will be the indications in our appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0517801100:57"/>
            <p>Permit me, before I conclude, to offer a caſe, by way of exemplification, which will afford, I preſume, no weak proof of what has been advanced.</p>
            <p>Mr. *****, a perſon of middle age, had been ſome time afflicted with a diſeaſe, ſimilar to what is termed GONORRHAEA LIBIDINOSA.</p>
            <p>His muſcular ſtamina were tolerably good; he had a great deal of nervous incitability; weak vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular irritability; the texture of the blood not firm, nor could be called broken; his digeſtion, tho' his appetite was tolerable, defective; he had now and then chillineſs, ſucceeded by fluſhing heats, which came on irregularly; his pulſe in general was ſlow, and undulating; and when quickened, as it would now and then be, on ſome extraordinary occaſions, weak; his viſcera all appeared found;<note n="*" place="bottom">Though delicacy prevents the inſertion of the Name, ſtill any medical Gentleman, deſirous of further information, may acquire it by application to the author, who, for the ſake of accuracy, read this account three times to the patient, and he, <hi>at that time,</hi> perfectly coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with the exactitude of the deſcription.</note>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0517801100:58"/>his bowels very irregular, ſometimes extremely coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, at others as much the reverſe—always in one extreme or the other; his urine pale, and limpid for the moſt part, but now and then depoſiting a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, furfuraceous, mucilaginous ſediment — he was petulant, and iraſcible when trifles perplexed him; when not, timid and deſpairing—his fluids were acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious; his memory weak, and his recollection painful; creative of much uneaſineſs, when he could not bring to his mind that of which he was in queſt —his whole frame was in general ſo languid, that ſlight motion greatly fatigued him; his extremities were in general cold — in eaſterly or ſouth-weſt winds he always complained of being worſe, and was perceptibly ſo — his nights were conſtantly reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs — he had ſometimes two or three emiſſions in the night; complained of partial heat at the lower part of the back, which he ſaid, now and then, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed itſelf all over him, and made him extremely faint—he was never thirſty.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0517801100:59"/>
            <p>In this ſtate he had continued for ten months, though now viſibly growing worſe, and had been under the care of two phyſicians of eminence: they had put him under a courſe of reſtringent medicines — bark, white vitriol, ginſeng, &amp;c. and ordered him the cold bath; but all proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
            <p>At this period, his conſtitution was conſidered in general after the mode above recommended; taking in alſo the topical affection—a weakneſs of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal veſſels, and determination of the fluids to thoſe parts creating heat, and cauſing emiſſions.</p>
            <p>The INDICATIONS OF CURE were,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To determine the Fluids externally, by increaſing Perſpiration — to ſtrengthen the digeſtive Organs — in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Irritability of the vaſcular ſyſtem — abate the nervous Incitability</hi> — and <hi>give tone and firmneſs to the habit in general,</hi> which were accompliſhed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſaline diaphoretics, warm tonics, camphorated
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0517801100:60"/>and aethereal anti-ſpaſmodics, and ſtomachic bitters —keeping the body moderately and gently open by mild aperients.</p>
            <p>Under this method, his extremities firſt loſt their coldneſs, in a great degree, and when warm, he always found himſelf relieved; at which time there was a great itching in his ſkin, which was diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appearing like an univerſal eſſera, the matter by a general ſtimulus under the ſkin, elevating the whole ſurface regularly, not ſhewing any eruptions, except here and there, one now and then, on his breaſt, or on the lower part of the head, juſt above the neck, at the roots of the hair. He began now to recover every day, and when his ſyſtem ſhewed it was in ſome degree invigorated, bathing in the Thames and riding exerciſe eſtabliſhed his cure.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the former Gentlemen had been ſo long unſucceſsful, appears very obvious: they had not paid any attention to the torpid ſtate of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0517801100:61"/>the vaſcular ſyſtem, on which account the fluids were always crowding upon the internal parts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their acrimony increaſed; and the aſtringent medicines, not being capable of exerting their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from a defect of vaſcular irritability, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being in ſuch a ſtate of torpor, as not to feel the effects.</p>
            <p>Hence the ſeminal veſſels, being before in a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ſtate, ſuffered a partial irritation, by the fluids there collected, occaſioning ſtimulus, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed heat — emiſſions ſucceeded emiſſions — the machine became more and more debilitated — the nervous incitability increaſed; the conſequence of which would ſoon have been a hectic fever with a tabes.</p>
            <p>Would time permit, a variety of caſes might be adduced, in which ſimilar ſucceſs from ſimilar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have confirmed the validity of a practice ſo founded — and I am fully perſuaded, that in all our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0517801100:62"/>recitals of caſes, whether ſucceſsfully or unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully treated, were we to advert to what, perhaps, by ſome may be conſidered as minutiae too trifling in the preſent ſcale of phyſic, we ſhould find, as well from one as the other, much uſeful matter proceeding—And I have no doubt but we ſhould diſcover, in very many, if not in all, the reaſons why accounts ſo ſimilar in their deſcriptions, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar in their conſequences, have, and do preſent themſelves daily to our view.</p>
            <p>But I flatter myſelf, what has been already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced will be ſufficient to afford hints, that may induce ſome more capable to attempt the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and give ſtill clearer views than lies within the compaſs of my very limited knowledge: I ſhall, therefore, conclude in the words of a favorite au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as they are expreſſive of my wiſhes—<q>"Non dicam, quod ad commodiorem &amp; certiorem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi methodum nihil exinde inveniri poſſit.
