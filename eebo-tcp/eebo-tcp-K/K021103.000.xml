            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING no other News, I am tempted to ſend you, with ſome Remarks upon it, a Diſcourſe that lately came to my Hands, ſubſcribed <hi>from a Merchant in</hi> London, <hi>to a Diſpenſary Phyſician, with the Phyſician's Anſwer.</hi> The Subject of the Diſcourſe being, <hi>The preſent State of Phyſick and Surgery;</hi> at my entrance upon it I could not judg the Author leſs than a <hi>Drugſter,</hi> as knowing no other Merchants ſo nearly concerned with Phyſick. But reading on, and finding him complain of the Luxuriant Uſe of Medicines, it was natural to conclude he had been ſome great Sufferer. But coming at length to the Phyſician's Anſwer, and finding that ſo like the Product of one and the ſame Ingeny; I was tempted to think the Merchant broke, and lately turned Phyſician; or the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician wanting Buſineſs, to have newly took up the Trade of a Merchant. But I had no ſooner peruſed the whole Treatiſe, than I found out the Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Bottom of the Buſineſs to be no leſs than a War proclaimed by one Company of Merchants againſt another for interloping; or (to be plain) the Apothecaries having been trading in that part, which the Phyſicians count their proper Province, the <hi>Doctors</hi> as an Act of Hoſtility retaliate, and are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Apothecaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What may be the conſequence of this Breach of the Peace, time muſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; but I hope, Sir, you who are known to be a diſintereſted Perſon, and as ſuch a more proper and fit Judg of the Grounds and Management of the War, may inſinuate ſomething that may be a more proper Medium to compoſe the Difference, or at leaſt more advantageous to the People, who muſt bear the Charge of the War, than any thing has been ſaid, or is likely to be done by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party.</p>
            <p>Here are forty ſix Doctor-Apothecaries, againſt a thouſand Apothecary-Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which is great Odds. But the Apothecaries ſay, 'tis the Doctors Fear that multiplies them beyond the true Number: Be it ſo, the Doctors ſhew their Valour the more, ſince they are reſolved to engage; and I don't know but if they can bring in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies as Auxiliaries, as they ſeem to threaten, by inſinuating the Merchants Concern and Acquaintance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0194501100:3"/>with their Affairs, they will be capable to ruin more than 1000 Cliſter-pipe Men Horſe and Foot; the Doctors themſelves being all 46 Commiſſion-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: Tho the Apothecaries ſay one half of them are as unfit for their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as other Folks; 'tis only the Virtue of <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> makes them the ſame Doctors in the Common Cauſe, and able to ſay, <hi>Nos Poma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, the Merchant-Phyſician, or Doctor-Apothecary (which he pleaſes) exhibits divers Articles againſt the Apothecary-Doctors, as a juſt Cauſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Arms, having received them at an Evening-Muſter at the College, after Orders given concerning a large Confluence of Sick and Maimed, ſome Merchants no doubt.</p>
            <p>In the Preface to the Diſcourſe he aſſerts,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'<hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Apothecaries have often reproach'd the Phyſicians, that the Poor were left to their Care, and that they neglected the Pharmaceu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Part, or Preparation of Remedies now lodged in themſelves. But the Doctor is convinc'd that the Diſpenſary is the greateſt Relief to the Poor, who have the <hi>beſt Advice and beſt Phyſick</hi> at very ſmall Expence. The Phyſicians are often conſidering the Drugs, carefully viewing the common Preparations, improving them, and adding others which they think or judg more uſeful.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed, that the Phyſicians have not been reproached without Cauſe, they have not hitherto been uſed to give Advice to large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of ſick Perſons <hi>Gratis:</hi> having no Remedies to ſell to them that had no Fees to give, the Poor have been forced to go to them that had, or wholly to let Nature alone to ſtruggle with its Diſeaſes. Nor have the Phyſicians only neglected, but been ignorant of the Pharmaceutick Part. Neither can the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries any more than the Phyſicians pretend themſelves compleat herein, being generally alike ignorant of the chief and moſt artful Part, <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> leaving its moſt effectual Preparations to the Care of thoſe, whoſe Care is only how they may make them, not moſt adapted to the Cure of Diſeaſes, but to their beſt Advantage; profeſſing no Skill in Diſeaſes, or the Virtues of what they make in order to remove them.</p>
            <p>But the Diſpenſary, tho it be an Acknowledgment of the Faults the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have been reproached with, is not the greateſt relief to the Poor; nor have we more than their own Words to aſſure us that they will, yea or can afford the beſt Advice, and the beſt Medicines cheaper than other Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>That they can give the beſt Advice is but their own immodeſt Boaſt; but that they are ſo ſoon become the beſt skilled in Pharmaceuticks, tho with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a few poor Apothecaries amongſt them, we know 'tis very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not impoſſible; or that they can conſider the Drugs, much farther than to know them by Sight, ſince they have but lately dealt that way; nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0194501100:4"/>are they much more likely to improve or add to the common Preparations. But,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'<hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſays the Citizens often complain to the Phyſicians of the very chargeable Bills of the Apothecaries, and declare their Jealouſy of a Combination, in multiplying Medicines and Doſes needleſsly. But the Diſpenſary relieves the firſt by ſelling almoſt at the firſt Coſt, or 18 in 20 cheaper than the Apothecaries. And the Diſpenſary Phyſicians being under no Engagements with the Apothecaries, cure with one or few Preſcriptions in leſs difficult Caſes, and with no more than neceſſary in the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (avoiding all Medicines acting on Nature with more or leſs Violence) the more hazardous extreme: The Charge under 10 or 20 <hi>s.</hi> in a Fever or the Smallpox, inſtead of ſo many Pounds; many require not more than three or four Shillings worth, which by ſubdividing into Boles, Pouders and Draughts, come in a Bill to four or five Pounds.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Apothecaries Bills no doubt have been larger or ſmaller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proportion of their Conſciences; it cannot fairly be ſuppoſed, they have been all alike culpable: but it is no wonder the People have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the dearneſs of the Wares, where the Brokers have been ſo well paid for adviſing to the Bargain; two Charges muſt needs look great, where one had been enough, and Advice and Medicines too might have been afforded at the Charge of either. A Combination between Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Apothecaries, where there was a mutual Dependance, was but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; <hi>Manus Manum fricat.</hi> But now it is paſt doubt, ſince the Diſpenſary Phyſicians declare, they are at preſent under no Engagements to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries.</p>
            <p>But the Diſpenſary Phyſicians ſay, they are now reſolved to be honeſt, and ſell their Remedies almoſt at the firſt Coſt. <hi>Almoſt and hard by,</hi> &amp;c. but if they ſell ſo cheap, and uſe but few Preſcriptions, I doubt they will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparing in their Viſits, or lower their Fees which may make amends, tho they give their Phyſick unvalued; but how can we be aſſured, that they will, or rather that they can cure with <hi>one, few,</hi> or <hi>no more than are neceſſary?</hi> Preſcriptions I do not know, unleſs they firſt demonſtrate by their Practice that their Skill is greater than other Phyſicians, which is yet to be done. But they diſcover their Diſcretion more than their Skill, in avoiding the more active Medicines. <hi>'Tis dangerous medling with Edg-Tools,</hi> by thoſe that have not been uſed to handle them: a Bone Knife is fit for Children, that they may not cut one another; but if Phyſicians ſhould venture to uſe more active Remedies, Diſtempers might terminate one way or other too ſoon, to require many Viſits, and conſequently fewer Fees would be gotten. But Gentlemen may have the Small Pox, or Fever cured for ten or twenty Shillings, which we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in Medicines, and that ſometimes is very dear, when as theſe Diſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0194501100:5"/>commonly are cured by Nature without Aſſiſtance: Many Diſeaſes they ſay for three or four Shillings; but what theſe Diſeaſes are, it were good alſo to know, whether Tooth-ach or Corns; and what Fees are required beſides, and whether the Diſpenſary Men will truſt. But,</p>
            <q>
               <p>'<hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſays he, the Apothecaries have kept the Doctors many Years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dread of their Power, who they ſay command in all Families, and can bring in and turn out whom they pleaſe; they govern as a Tyrant his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, making them obedient by grievous Taxes; ſo that they dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult a Phyſician, unleſs at the laſt Extremity. Phyſicians would govern their Patients by their own Reaſon: The Patients have the Liberty of cheap Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and of conſulting at a beginning of a Diſtemper, ſecure from expence which ſhall ſurprize. The Phyſicians would prevent their own Ruin, chiefly from their beſt Succeſs.'</p>
               <p>'This has hitherto been the Caſe of the Faculty; if they conquer'd a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, the Remedy (tho not the manner of uſing it) becomes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries <hi>Noſtrum,</hi> and the Doctor is left to invent more. The Diſpenſary complies with the two Propoſals of the Apothecaries, removes the Peoples Complaint and Jealouſy of a Cheat put on them by all Phyſicians, and gives the Licenſe to him to uſe his own Method and Preſcripts, to his Patients Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and his own.'</p>
               <p>'The Apothecary cannot complain he is injur'd: for as he ſeizes on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing Part, as a Dependency he would annex to the Shop-Trade; the other from the Example brings them both together, the better to ſerve the Publick. If the Apothecary proves an Ambo-dexter, feels the Pulſe with one hand, and makes Medicines with the other; why may not the College pleaſe the People with the ſame Dexterity? unleſs (which is reaſonable in the Caſe of Life and Health) the Apothecaries will wholly practiſe the judicial Part, and leave the miniſterial, of making Medicines, to the Phyſician.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It is a ſhame for Phyſicians to confeſs, that the Apothecaries have kept the Doctors many Years under the Fear of their Power, or that they ſhould command in all Families: indeed it ſeems natural for the People to ask the Apothecary, who is the moſt skilful Phyſician, he being more capable to judg than the People; and on this account they have had a Capacity to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch as they thought would preſcribe beſt either for the Patients or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries Diſeaſe, which ſoever lay with moſt pain on his Mind: but how they ſhould make them obedient by taxing hard, I do not ſee, unleſs one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil being leſs than two, they chuſe to ſubmit themſelves wholly to the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carys Care, if not fearing the Fees more than the Bill, yet being ſure both would be much heavier; ſo that only Extremity or Experience of the Apothecarys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency could make them ſee other Counſel.</p>
            <p>It were certainly well if Phyſicians could govern the Patients by Reaſon, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0194501100:6"/>that of their own ſtock, as well as give 'em Medicines of their own preparing, without putting 'em in fear of large Fees, or dear Phyſick; then no doubt they would conſult 'em ſooner.</p>
            <p>And it were very well, if Phyſicians would not only prevent their own ruin, but their Patients alſo by their good ſucceſs; and that he that has the beſt ſucceſs might have moſt buſineſs, which can hardly be whilſt Phyſicians are D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
            <p>How Apothecaries ſhould get any certain <hi>Noſtrum</hi>'s from Phyſicians Preſcripts, I don't eaſily ſee, ſince they have been ſo Numerous, and compounded in almoſt every Caſe, that the Phyſician himſelf muſt needs be ignorant what did the Cure: but if the Apothecary was ſo ſagacious as to ſee what wrought the Effect, how could he be ſo dull as not to learn the manner of uſing it?</p>
            <p>Whether the Diſpenſary will remove the peoples Complaints and Jealouſy, does not yet appear; or whether the Diſpenſary Doctors, and their Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys will be leſs combin'd, and more honeſt than others, or more for either the Phyſicians or Patient's advantage.</p>
            <p>But, if the Apothecary can't complain that he is injur'd by the Diſpenſary, which only follows his Example, in bringing the Adviſing and Shop-trade to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to the better ſervice of the Publick; certainly, the Diſpenſary Phyſician can with as little reaſon complain of the Apothecary, for ſetting him the Good Example, in better ſerving the Publick: If the Apothecary was the firſt Ambo-dexter that the Doctor thought worthy to imitate, why ſhould he be ſo angry at the Maſter that gave him ſo fair a Copy? And if it be ſo reaſonable in caſes of Life and Death, to practiſe only the Judicial part, why may not the practiſing Apothecary leave the making of Medicines only to his Man, whom he himſelf has inſtructed, as well as the Diſpenſary-Phyſician to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary at the College, who perhaps muſt inſtruct his Maſters?</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But the Diſpenſary (adds he) has been impeached with the Barbarous deſign, of deſtroying the Apothecarys Company. But they ſcorn the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and declare the greateſt Eſteem of thoſe of the Society, who (like the Gentleman near the College) <hi>Moribus Antiquis,</hi> are as Eminent for their care in preparing the beſt Medicines, as for their integrity and modeſty, in not invading the Profeſſion, or abuſing and deſtroying the People.'</q>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the Diſpenſarys multiply, and the People believe they are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure relief to the ſick, the Apothecarys muſt fall, unleſs thoſe few who like the Gentleman near the College, <hi>Antiqua Ignorantia,</hi> are the more to be truſted for good Medicines, becauſe they dare not pretend to underſtand the Uſe of them.</p>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the Apothecaries are ſo likely to be deſtroyed <hi>Suis Copiis,</hi> what need of ſo much noiſe at them? let them go quietly down: but unleſs they multiply more than other men, I don't ſee how their number can deſtroy them any more, than the Multiplying of any State or Kingdom can deſtroy it. But it is not barely the Multiplying, or deſtruction of the Apothecarys, that troubles the Diſpenſary, ſo much as what follows.</p>
            <q>
               <p>'That they avow with aſſurance, that they have or will take all the Practice of Phyſick into their own hands, reſerving only 5 or 6 great Men, to take on themſelves the Odium of the Deaths of their Patients.'</p>
               <p>'The Surgeons fare not better than the Faculty, they are reſerv'd for the difficult Caſes, robb'd of the more Common, by which they only can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Skill and Dexterity for the more important.'</p>
               <p>'The Poor are undone in every ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'</p>
               <p>'The Diſpenſary pretends to preſerve thoſe who are more numerous than the Apothecarys, and it will be the <hi>Alma Mater</hi> to the Phyſicians, from the two Univerſitys, who will be capable to exerciſe the Learning they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired there.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This is the Grand fault of the Apothecaries, that they undertake to practiſe: Let them have been as great Knaves as they would, if they had never medled in any thing that had been to the Diſhonour, or rather and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Diſadvantage of the Doctors (for now <hi>Plurimus auro venit Honos</hi>) they might have ruin'd themſelves without pity I do not queſtion: And thoſe Men that are content to take on them the Odium of the Deaths of the ſlain amongſt them, or to excuſe their own faults by the Apothecaries miſtakes, have the Honour of being well paid no doubt. Tho the Surgeons loſe ſome of the ſmall Jobs by the Apothecarys Officiouſneſs, they do not ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; but they fit them as well as the Diſpenſary, commonly making their own Medicines, and if they loſe the Ordinary Caſes, yet they arc the more uſed to the Difficult. But</p>
            <p>The Poor ſuffer moſt truly in every Diſeaſe, Corporeal or Crumenal, whether Poor Doctors, Apothecarys, Surgeons or People; and Poor <hi>we</hi> are firſt to be cared for, whatever the Pretence be of the Diſpenſary's being the <hi>Alma Mater,</hi> where the Phyſicians from the two Univerſities may exerciſe their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Peſtle, and beat out great matters in Pharmacy.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But the other Objection of the unobſerving People, whoſe memory may not ſerve 'em well, is that the Apothecarys ſell as cheap.

            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The People don't remember (we doubt) that the Doctors told them they ſell cheaper than the Apothecarys; 'tis granted they may if they will: but by the conjoint Artifices of the Doctors yet their Confederates, in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they enhance the price of an Electuary from 12 pence to 12 Shillings; but they could never have done it, if they had not ſound their advantage by the Doctors frequent <hi>Repetatur's,</hi> tho I hardly believe every half hour, <hi>tertia vel quarta quaque hora</hi> being commonly the moſt.</p>
            <p>But the laſt and vileſt Objection is, <q>'That the Subſcribers to the Diſpenſary are not as Eminent as the Phyſicians, the Apothecaries Favorites: 'Tis own'd they can make famous or infamous by a few Cabals and Viſits; but is there any part of Phyſick, even Poetry, which theſe Gentlemen can't pretend to as well as the other, who diſtruſt their own merit by courting their favour, putting themſelves in their ſervice, and plying them, as Porters a Shop of the Largeſt Buſineſs?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Eminence of Phyſicians now adays, does not indeed reſult from real Worth or Accompliſhment, but may ariſe from the Report of Men, that talk even like the Apothecaries. But the Diſpenſary, and the other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians (I believe) are indifferently the ſame, ſome wiſe and ſome otherwiſe: but that Poetry ſhould be counted a part of Phyſick, and with a <hi>even,</hi> as if it were the <hi>Culmen Artis,</hi> would have been a ſtrange fancy till of late. I think Mr. <hi>Colebatch,</hi> and his Antagoniſt (however their <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alkalies</hi> ſtood affected) agreed in this, that tho Poetry is a very pretty accompliſhment, yet a Poet and a Phyſician are vaſtly different. <hi>Letter to a Gentleman concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alkaly and Acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it muſt be acknowledged, that to get Buſineſs is a valuable part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and to have written a Poem has not long ſince for ſome time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſome late Doctors more than all their Cures, and other fine Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But it was not till after a long Diſcourſe (he ſays further) that our Doctor or Merchant, could penetrate into the more abſtruſe and ſecret deſign of the Diſpenſary.'</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Now comes the Myſtery, which he was not (being but a Pupil) to be preſently let into, or capable of apprehending. <q>
                  <p>But 'twas own'd at laſt by thoſe, the moſt proper Judges, that the People in the more common Ilneſſes recover eaſily by the Strength of Nature, or one or two proper Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> There are ſeveral things very obſervable in this ſecret and abſiruſe Deſign.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That in uſual and common Diſeaſes, people would recover by the Strength of Nature.</item>
               <item>2. That even in theſe Diſeaſes, ſomething muſt be done, or there is nothing to be got.</item>
               <item>3. That he that takes no Fees can't be well paid for looking on the Patient, unleſs he can perſwade him to take a great deal of Phyſick.</item>
               <item>4. In Diſeaſes that are dangerous, when Nature is weak or raging, it can be ſaved only by one Criſis.</item>
               <item>5. That many doſes of Phyſick given, whether hot or cold, will divert the Criſis, and bring certain deſtruction.</item>
               <item>6. That great Numbers are kill'd by Phyſick, which would have recover'd without any.</item>
               <item>7. That the Remedy of this pernicious Practice can be had only from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary. In theſe particulars, we have more couch'd than at firſt one would be readily aware of, and the Oracle that gave this abſtruſe account hath ſhew'd an uncommon ſagacity, which will never permit me to think there are not Men of great parts in the Diſpenſary.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Grand deſign of theſe Sophi is to get thoſe Patients that will recover by the ſtrength of Nature, or whoſe Diſeaſes will terminate by a Criſis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Phyſick, that is, all the common and moſt numerous Diſorders, with the acute Diſeaſes, which is certainly the moſt advantageous Practice: And doing nothing but a ſmall matter, for a Colour of Merit, that people may not think they give Fees for nothing, will not quickly expend the Drugs, and Medicines in the Repoſitory; but a ſmall Stock will carry on the Shop-trade, tho they ſhould ſell as cheap as they pretend: but this is not all, there is commonly more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit got by curing thoſe Diſeaſes that need no cure, or will terminate ſoon by the efforts of Nature; for when the Patient is well, the Diſeaſe was this or that grievous Malady: one or two proper Directions, that is, what will do neither good nor hurt, muſt be given to ſatisfy the Patients and their Friends, or elſe the Fees will hardly ſatisfy the Doctor. Tho it is the Opinion of one of the Company, that a Phyſician in many caſes, eſpecially in the Small pox,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0194501100:10"/>deſerves his Fees better for directing nothing, than for doing ſo (ſee Dialogue between <hi>Alkaly</hi> and <hi>Acid, pag.</hi> 71.) But I cannot conceive, why the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary practice of doing nothing, ſhould be the only Remedy for theſe Diſeaſes; and why an Apothecary or other Phyſician, may not cure by the ſame Method. But the People being afraid of Fees in ſmall or common Diſeaſes, are apt to run to Apothecaries; ſo the Doctors loſe the moſt eaſy, ſpeedy and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Buſineſs: But Apothecaries being as willing to grow rich as any, make them pay dear for a Multitude of unneceſſary and pernicious Medicines, and ſo the People ſuffer wherever they go.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the College of Phyſicians are divided, we may expect the Houſe cannot ſtand; but I think it is no juſt cenſure, that the Phyſicians that are not of the Diſpenſary, are of the Apothecaries Party, in oppoſition to the good of the People; for I know ſome that have leſs to do with the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries than the Diſpenſary, who are only become Apothecaries themſelves, or confederate with ſome Apothecaries of their own: nor does it appear that the Welfare of the People, and not their own advantage, is the only thing they aim at, or is more ſought by them than by divers others.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'When it ſhall become ſenſible (adds he) how the Publick is impoſed on in the expence in Sickneſs, and in Life it ſelf, the Laws which now puniſh Offenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will at laſt interpoſe the Cure of more latent and enormous Crimes. The Faculty will have the Protection it demands, after the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſtipulated Conditions; the Diſpenſary will have the publick regard, or obſerve its Enemies puniſhed with Fines more than the 100 Marks, or the other more ſevere, the loſs of Life, from Medicines in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Quantities as deſtructive as Poiſon.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Here the Diſpenſary is very uppiſh, and threatens its Enemies with Fines, and Death; which I confeſs will be a greater Argument againſt their Enemies, than any they have yet given.</p>
            <p>But what they mean by loſs of Life from Medicines in exorbitant Quantities, as deſtructive as Poiſon, I do not know, unleſs they deſign to get an Act that whoever will not regard the Diſpenſary ſhall be poiſoned by large Doſes of Phyſick: but the Legiſlators ought to be very well ſatisfied, in the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Conditions, that they be not only publiſhed, but that they be performed e're they make Laws againſt either the People, or all other Phyſicians.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>BUT we come now to the Merchants Letter, where firſt he informs us, <q>'that he had a Fever, which was cured by the Diſpenſary Method of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſew Medicines, and thoſe ſeldom given.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This I confeſs is a good Method, if the Medicines are good; but there may certainly be a Fault as well in giving too little as too much: and I believe many Medicines prove ineffectual on this very account, and the right Method does not lie in giving little or much, but juſt enough, which a Man may judg of without being of the Diſpenſary. <q>'But this Caution gave him greater Confidence in the Art, with the Aſſurance he had of the Medicines being faithfully prepared and diſpenſed at the College.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> What Aſſurance the Merchant was capable of receiving, that the Medicines are faithfully prepared and diſpenſed at the College, I know not; but I do not ſee what the People can have to ſatisfy them, more than their Words, which other Apothecaries alſo are ready to give, tho it be but a ſmall Proof.</p>
            <q>
               <p>'But when the Doctor allowed him to ſit up and receive his Friends, they gave him an account (ſays he) of the new Revolution in Phyſick, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Deſign of the Diſpenſary, which they were extremely ſatisfied with. They told him, this Conteſt between the honeſt Phyſicians of the Diſpenſary (thus it ſeems they are diſtinguiſhed, tho the Word hath lately loſt its value) and the Apothecaries ſupported by their Confederates the Anti-College Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, was as much the common Diſcourſe as the Difference between the two Companies, or the great Factions which divide the Nation. But,'</p>
               <p>''Twas not eaſy for them to find out the Reaſon and Pretence of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; but they who had been adviſed by the Diſpenſary, and uſed their Medicines, could more eaſily diſcover the true Cauſes of the Separation, than the Citizens, who yet lie under great Errors and Prejudices in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair: And the Caſe according to the Opinion of the whole Company is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe following Particulars.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This whole Company of Viſitants no doubt were all Merchants concerned, and adviſed by the Diſpenſary (tho ſome ſort of Patients) and not ignorant Citizens, or elſe they would not have had ſo great Satisfaction in the Generoſity of the Diſpenſary Deſign, and have ſeen ſo much into the Cauſes of their Quarrel with other Phyſicians and Apothecaries. But, I never heard
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0194501100:12"/>ſo much I confeſs of their Factions as of thoſe that divide the Nation, or that the Diſpenſary Men are the only honeſt Phyſicians: and tho they aſſume to themſelves the Name of Honeſt in oppoſition, and diſtinction from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctors and Apothecaries; yet I think they cannot be very proud of it, ſince the Word <hi>honeſt</hi> hath lately loſt its value as they confeſs, and ſo their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty is of no great account.</p>
            <p>But that the Apothecaries are ſupported by the Anti-College Phyſicians, I believe is a ſlip of the Pen; it ſhould have been Anti-Diſpenſary Phyſicians, for none uſe Apothecaries ſo much as thoſe of the College.</p>
            <p>But let us hear the Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'The honeſt Phyſician is obliged by the Truſt repoſed in him by the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and his Intereſt in the Succeſs, to take care that the Medicines are effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and faithfully diſpenſed: if the Inſtruments are not good, the effect of the Advice is loſt; by a miſtake in weight or meaſure, the Life of the Patient is deſtroyed.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> What the Merchant ſays here is certainly very true, but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary Phyſician cannot with any Modeſty aſſert himſelf the only honeſt Phyſician, if the word be took in its uſual Senſe; and others are as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Conſcience and Intereſt as he; and I have known an honeſt Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithfully diſpenſe an effectual Medicine according to the reputed honeſt Doctor's Preſcript, to the deſtruction of the Patient; who had he known the Caſe, would never have done according to the Doctor's Order, nor have let the deadly miſtake in the Doſe, which was merely the Doctor's, have its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But the Apothecary (adds he) neglects his Duty to the Phyſician and the Sick; is rarely in his Shop, prepares few Medicines, but buys them under great uncertainties; truſts raw Apprentices to ſelect the Ingredients, and meaſure the Proportion in the Preſcript.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This cannot juſtly be ſaid of the Apothecaries in general, ſome of them are as honeſt as any in the Diſpenſary no doubt, and not guilty of theſe Crimes. But,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'The People, he ſays further, who are not acquainted with the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of two Evils chuſe the leaſt as they think, by uſing the Apothecaries, believe they ſave the Doctors Fees; tho the Medicines brought in in little Parcels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> riſe to a greater Sum 3 in 4 in moſt Caſes, than both Advice and Phyſick in moſt Diſeaſes.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This I believe is too often true, but ought not to be a univerſal Charge; and it has been too often found that the Doctor has taken more for Fees than was neceſſary for Phyſick and Advice too. But ſays he,</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0194501100:13"/>
            <p>
               <q>'The Aſſociate part of the College, ſeeling the Apothecarys power in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, readily come in, or are forc'd to ſerve under 'em, on condition they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the increaſe of the Bill, and raiſe their Ability to adviſe, to an equal pitch with their own: by both which the Apothecaries intereſt is more confirm'd and improv'd.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This is a very great Scandal to the greateſt part of the College, none being excepted but the Diſpenſary; but they have one commendation theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers want, <hi>viz.</hi> that they raiſe the Ability of the Apothecarys to adviſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with their own, which ſhews they are not ſo ſelfiſh as others; and if the Apothecary be as able to adviſe, I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould not: And by this the Peoples intereſt will be confirm'd and improv'd as well as the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But he continues, <q>'The Deſign is therefore to revive the former Practice of Phyſick, particularly that of <hi>Lower</hi> and <hi>Sydenham,</hi> who had greater ſucceſs with fewer Remedies than now are forc'd upon the People: or rather to expoſe the Method the Phyſicians and Apothecaries uſe to themſelves and Friends, of avoiding carefully the Exceſs by which innocent things become deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Practice of <hi>Lower</hi> and <hi>Sydenham</hi> can't well be call'd the former Practice, nor is the methed of Practice ſo much altered ſince their time, nor could I ever hear of their extraordinary ſucceſs above other Phyſicians; I believe they us'd but few Medicines, for to do them juſtice they knew not many, having none of the profoundeſt skill in Pharmacy: But having great Names, perhaps in ſome caſes great Expectations might alter the Patients, with a very ſmall matter beſide. But if the Deſign be to expoſe the Method Phyſicians and Apothecaries uſe to themſelves and Friends, of carefully avoiding the Exceſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a Commendation, and they will be willing to be expos'd, whether Diſpenſary Doctors, Apothecaries or others. He adds,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But the Diſpenſary deſigns to convince the People by their experience, that the moſt uſeful and effectual Remedies are of no great Price.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> But then it muſt be taken for granted, that they have the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual Remedies, which we know they have not; tho they offer to ſale their <hi>Arcana</hi>'s in their Bill lately diſpers'd. Nor will I grant that the moſt uſeful and effectual Remedies are of ſmall value, or ought to be ſold for a mean Price, unleſs the Fee makes amends.</p>
            <p>He goes on ſaying, <q>'The Publick will ſoon be ſenſible that the Expence in almoſt all Diſeaſes <hi>per Diem</hi> will be of <hi>one, two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Shillings, inſtead of ſo many Pounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that their Diſtempers will ſooner yield to a few well prepar'd College-Medicines, than to the decay'd, vicious, and adulterate of the Shops; and the Phyſicians Reward and Remedies too come far ſhort of the Total of a long Bill.'</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0194501100:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It is a hard matter to ſay what the daily Expence of all Diſeaſes will be; but it is the uſual Method of Traders to pretend to underſell one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to get cuſtom; but they propoſe Advantage by it: and we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this rate is to the Poor. But how any will be aſſur'd Diſeaſes will yield to College-Medicines ſooner than to others, or that they will be well prepar'd, I know not, or how they can ſay ſhop-Medicines are decay'd, vicious, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, yet thoſe in the College-Shops will never be ſo.</p>
            <p>But ſays he, <q>'The Diſpenſary can't fail of univerſal Approbation, when the People reflect that they have in many Caſes uſed the Method they recommend, preparing in their Houſes the white Decoction, Infuſions of Rubarb and Senna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or uſing the common Cordial Waters, Spirits, and Tinctures bought of the Druggiſt, Chymiſt, or Wholeſale ſhops.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Diſpenſary (or Merchant for 'em) now aſſures it ſelf, and that infallibly, of a univerſal Approbation, when once the People reflect that they han't only imitated the Apothecaries keeping Shops and ſelling Medicines, but uſed even the peoples Method (which muſt needs be good) in preparing the <hi>white Decoction, Infuſion of Senna;</hi> Grand Remedies, and wiſely prepared no doubt! but <hi>Cordial Waters, Spirits and Tinctures</hi> bought of the Druggiſt, Chymiſt, or Wholeſale ſhops, they cry down in the Apothecary, but imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the People.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But when its Uſe (he ſays further) ſhall become more publick, their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Charity and regard to Mankind will be loudly applauded; and the Advantages from it to this City allow'd to be greater than all the Royal mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Hoſpitals in <hi>Europe.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark. Ingens Gloria calcar habet,</hi> I ſee; but Charity and Philanthropy uſually begin at home, and where it appears it ought to be applauded.</p>
            <p>That the Diſpenſary may poſſibly be of more Advantage to the City than all the Hoſpitals in <hi>Europe</hi> except its own, I readily believe; but whether it will be any to it, or themſelves, is yet doubtful.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'This is the ſhort view (ſays he) I could take of the preſent and future State of Phyſick (obvious to every one that will confider his own intereſt, or not be very unwilling to be inform'd) but becauſe it is an affair of the greateſt Concern of our Life, your Friends oblige me to conſult you, and report to 'em your Opinion of the grievous Diſtemper, and the moſt probable methods of curing it, with an unanimous Reſolution to ſupport and encourage a Deſign, by which all Conditions of Men are equally obliged.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This is the view which that Merchant and his Friends could take; but how this preſent and future State of Phyſick is ſo obvious, and in relation to the Diſpenſary an affair of the greateſt importance, I don't ſee. Well, but the Merchant is oblig'd to conſult the Phyſician, with a promiſe of the unanimous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0194501100:15"/>of the Merchants to ſupport and encourage the Deſign: but I am afraid ſince the Merchants have been lately found guilty, and puniſhed for promoting Deſigns, they will not be ſo free or able for the future to oblige all Conditions of Men.</p>
            <p>But, we come to the Diſmal Account which the Merchant received from the Phyſician of the Barbarous treatment of the Sick, ſo far as his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would ſerve him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That we are impos'd on more than any other Nation in all the Arts that relate to Life and Health.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> We are like to be impos'd on ſtill, if ſome other Method be not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed than that the Diſpenſary propoſes, being no way aſſur'd we ſhall not be impos'd on by them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That the common and moſt uſeful Remedies are put upon the People at a Rate, in moſt fifty times, in many one hundred times more than their intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick value.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The common Remedies are not the moſt uſeful, nor are the moſt uſeful put upon the People; but the intrinſick value of the moſt uſeful Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not known to the Diſpenſary, they being ignorant of them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That the exorbitant Expence ruins the Poor, and deters them and the Rich from a juſt care of their Health, to avoid oppreſſive Treatment, ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſeaſes.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Exorbitant Expence, if the Poor can expend it, will ruin 'em no doubt; but I ſhould think the Fear of it ſhould not deter 'em or the Rich from, but fright 'em to a juſt Care of their Health: yet if the juſt Care of Health be to fee a Doctor, or go to an Apothecary, I am apt to think either of them will be ſomewhat chargeable.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'To hide theſe Exactions from the People, the Apothecaries allow none to practiſe with 'em but who betray their Profeſſion, countenance a vaſt quantity of Phyſick deſtructive, and ſupport exorbitant Rates in the Bills: Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are brought into all Families by them, and writing well is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage for writing very long Preſcriptions.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> That ſome of the Apothecaries are guilty of ſome of theſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I don't queſtion, but I think they charge too General; indeed, I have heard the term of Writing Well thus interpreted, and have heard that 2 or 3 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries have engaged with a young Phyſician to cry him upon condition he would thus write well: but ſuch things ought to be diſcover'd, who and when, and puniſh'd.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'The Eſteem of the Profeſſion is ſunk by the Scandal of all the Deaths in the Town thrown on Phyſicians, who are rarely conſulted but when the Caſe is made deſperate by the Apothecaries, and the Patient takes the Prognoſtick
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0194501100:16"/>of Death from the Change of Advice, and is deprived of that aſſurance which is the greateſt ſupport in Sickneſs.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Eſteem of thoſe that profeſs to ſave Lives muſt needs ſink where they are thought to do nothing, or to kill; and wherever the Work lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, one will blame the other. I have heard the Apothecary ſay, ſuch a one died <hi>Secundum Artem;</hi> and the Dr. is not always wanting to blame (or at leaſt inſinuate a Fault in) the Apothecary: but the Reaſon why perſons ſo rarely conſult the Phyſicians is their own fault, becauſe they will not proportion their Fees to the Capacities of the Patients, or more commonly adviſe freely. Fox a Patient to be afrighted with Death, in ſome caſes is very prejudicial, in ſome beneficial: a well grounded Aſſurance much promotes ſome Cures, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of an ignorant Phyſician many times does more than his Preſcripts, or even than thoſe of the more knowing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That the Study of Art is neglected, becauſe the Diſeaſes are by ill treatment forc'd into unnatural Symptoms, and differ from all thoſe your Authors treat of: there are in the Books of Phyſick no caſes manag'd by an Apothecary by almoſt one common random Method; your Writers have been careful in this to conceal the infamy of the People and your Profeſſion.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> A true account of Caſes duly manag'd, no doubt is of great uſe and benefit to Students in Phyſick, but I believe there are but few ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>But, he that can't judg of a Diſeaſe by what he ſees in the Patient, has not made any great proficiency in natural Knowledg; and it is a ſhame that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſhould confeſs the Study of Art is neglected, tho there were no Books; it was at firſt practis'd without any ſuch helps. But it had been well, if the late Writers had been careful to diſcover the ill Practice of thoſe People of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, tho to their infamy, that we might know what would not ſucceed, and what Rocks and Shelves to avoid, and not chuſe to make up their Obſervations on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Caſes more creditable.</p>
            <p>But he goes on, <q>'It is now ten years ſince a Committee of the honeſt Part of the College expoſed theſe Grievances to the Lord Mayor and Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and had convinc'd 'em of the neceſſity of removing the oppreſſion the Publick had long felt; and it was concluded the Phyſicians ſhould rate the Price of Medicines in their Preſcriptions. This was haughtily rejected by the Company at a Meeting in their Hall ſome Months after; a ſmall Number of the Younger Apothecaries offering to comply, were compel'd with threats to retract their promiſes. The Committee of the Aldermen and Commons (the Apothecaries flying from that as neceſſary as reaſonable Propoſal) deſir'd that the College would provide a Repoſitory of Medicines, which will and may have, and may juſtly claim (af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r twenty thouſand Bills made up there) their Regard and Protection.'</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0194501100:17"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> By the honeſt Part of the College we muſt underſtand, the 46 Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary Doctor-Apothecaries; but how the reſt will take it, to be without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction counted the Diſhoneſt part of the College, we may eaſily judg. It is now no new thing for ſome Phyſicians to cry down all others, even in their Morals, that they themſelves may be better thought on: But how even that honeſt part of the College could honeſtly pretend to rate the Medicines they ſhould have preſcribed, I don't know, when they neither know the Coſt nor Art of the Preparations; beſides, unleſs it were the honeſt part of the College, they might oblige the Apothecaries as well in rating as in preſcribing. Now the Apothecarys might well reject this Propoſal, that a parcel of Men that did not underſtand Trade (being not then turn'd Merchants) ſhould rate their Goods; and certainly thoſe that were willing to comply, muſt be very young, to ſuppoſe this Propoſal either reaſonable, neceſſary or poſſible; but the Diſpenſary Doctors having ſo very much buſineſs need not be diſcontented, or ſo earneſtly crave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; 20000 Bills one with another might well ariſe to 2000<hi>l.</hi> and the Fees make, more than that Sum neat profit, which would protect them ſufficiently from the attacks of 1000 Cliſterpipe Men.</p>
            <p>But he ſays further, <q>'The Laws of the laſt Age ſaw and provided againſt theſe vile Abuſes; but our Laws are ſubject to the ſame Diſeaſes as our ſelves, are fallen into the infirmity of old Age, and to be regardleſs of others concerns.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the Laws are diſeaſed, 'twill be well if the Diſpenſary can prepare powerful Remedies to cure them; but old Age I doubt will be beyond their cure, even in themſelves, tho they regard only their own concerns.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'You allow'd (adds he) the Faculty could not want the Art of relieving it ſelf, but one Party turns its force againſt another, like a vitious Compoſition of Ingredients of oppoſite Qualities has no virtue to ſubdue the Epidemick Malignity.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> I grant the Faculty has always ſtudied the Art of relieving it ſelf, and ſo have the Company; and becauſe theſe have been moſt expert in it, the Faculty complains: But the Faculty indeed is a vitious Compoſition, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity lies upon the People, it was never well compounded; even the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Ingredients are not without vice, nor will the Fermentation among them amend (I doubt) but rather exalt the Malignity, or the People ever be free from vile abuſes till there be a new and better Preſcript. He further adds,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'The great increaſe of Apothecaries is evidently the cauſe of all the preſent Grievances to the Profeſſion of Phyſick, to themſelves and the People. They are become 1000, ten to one Phyſician; the regulated Citys abroad allow no more than can make up the Phyſicians Directions one to ten. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſo great a Number can't be avoided, 900 can't poſſibly keep good
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0194501100:18"/>Medicines in their Shops; moſt of the Compoſitions, and moſt of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples often mov'd in little quantities, are ſubject to evaporate their moſt active Parts, to corrupt and become vapid and ſour, or rotten and ſtinking. Who will believe the ſimple Waters, Tinctures, Spirits, Pouders of volatil parts, Syrups, Electuaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can wait and keep well, till they have their turn to be us'd, when the Shops are as numerous as the ſick? they muſt be thrown away and ſupply'd anew, if the Cuſtomer can't be impos'd upon, but that will be ſooner than a new Preparation.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It now appears that it is the number of Apothecarys that moſt grieves the honeſt Profeſſors of Phyſick, and their own grief is firſt felt; the Apothecaries being a great many, get a great deal of the eaſieſt buſineſs, which the Profeſſion would have otherwiſe had: but if they are ten to one Phyſician, the College are not all Phyſicians; and if they were but one to ten, I believe they could not make up the Phyſicians Preſcriptions, which are commonly large enough. But the number of Apothecaries is not the chief cauſe that they can't keep good Remedies, but that the learned Doctors have given them ſuch a large and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compil'd Farrago of Medicines, that they will not keep good. They muſt have a great Catalogue of ſimple Waters, which ſignify nothing but to mix things as a Vehicle, many of which can be made but once a Year, and won't keep a Month without being corrupted, when Dr. <hi>Bates</hi>'s <hi>Hydropeg.</hi> or common Spring or diſtill'd Water is as good; likewiſe of Syrups, many of which are alſo made but once a Year, and are apt to ferment, grow four, or be fill'd with Flies, and which is worſe, are good for nothing but to clog the Stomach of ſick People. The ſame may be ſaid of the numerous Claſſes of Conſerves, and Electuaries made up with Sugar and Honey. Pouders are of very different Natures, ſome incorruptible, others ſoon ſpoil'd, and others never good: but Tinctures and Spirits may be kept long enough unchangeable, tho ever ſo vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til; and if they loſe any thing of ſtrength, a little larger Doſe will do.</p>
            <p>But a Diſpenſatory might eaſily be made of fewer and more effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not eaſily corruptible, were Phyſicians or Apothecaries well skill'd in the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> and <hi>Pharmacy;</hi> but until they are, were there ever ſo few Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, the ſick will be abuſed, while they are obliged to keep fooliſh things that one Doctor in 10 or a 100, or in the whole Town perhaps, has a fancy to uſe now and then.</p>
            <q>
               <p>'But the numbers of the Apothecaries (ſays he) like Hawkers are always viſiting the Families, and recommend the taking Trade in eaſieſt caſes; in others they quicken the uſe of Boles, and Draughts. They are rarely ſeen in their buſineſs of the Shop: The Preſcript of the Doctor and Apothecary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is left to be made up by the raw heedleſs Boy, that has not the Diſcretion of his Maſter; whoſe utmoſt care is required, when the Patients Life is loſt by almoſt every Miſtake.'</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0194501100:19"/>
               <p>'The vomitive, corroſive, chymical Liquors or Pouders, may be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Cordials of the ſame Colours: Can the Boy bring his Mind to a ſteadineſs, to number his Drops of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> or violent Acids, to weigh half a grain of <hi>Opium, Elaterium,</hi> or judg the Patient muſt die by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem, boiled after this or that Decoction, or that a Copper Veſſel ſhall make the Preparation poiſonous?'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remmark.</hi> The number of Apothecaries will not much alter the Caſe, if the Numbers of Doctors and other People encreaſed alike; but if they would hauk only for the Doctors, we ſhould not have the Numbers complained of; and if they were ſewer, they would truſt as much to Boys or ſome other Servants having more Buſineſs: but being many, and the Buſineſs divided among them, they may the better attend themſelves. Many Faults are no doubt committed by Boys, in miſtaking things and their Doſes, and ſometimes in not being able to read or underſtand the Doctor's bad Hand or Latin, or correct his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes as to the Doſe, or things preſcribed together, or the Nature of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which ſome Maſters have done e're now, and thereby ſaved the Life of the Patient, of which Inſtances might be given. But ſays he,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'The honeſt Apothecaries alſo complain and lament the Difficulties, which by the exorbitant Numbers are brought on the People and themſelves; that their Medicines cannot be vented while good and fit for uſe.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It ſeems there are ſome honeſt Apothecaries then, even in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Diſpenſary-Doctors, and no doubt they are alike honeſt to themſelves, and wiſh there were fewer of the Company, that they might have better Trade; and if they were as factious as the College, they might deſtroy one another, and the great ones devour the little ones. The ſpoiling of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines is from their extravagant Numbers and undurable Qualities (as before ſaid) not the Number of their Makers.</p>
            <p>He adds, <q>'that they and their Servants are baſely uſed as Porters, to fetch and carry Boles and Glaſſes, and have not leiſure in their Shops to prepare and compound any thing, but buy abroad.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> They are Porters to the Doctors then, and why not to the honeſteſt, who ought to ſend their Bills to them to encourage their Honeſty, and not take the Trade out of their Hands, by ſetting up Shops of their own? But if they have not leiſure for all their Buſineſs, it is a ſign they have too much trade. But further, <q>'They are forced to adviſe againſt their Conſcience, commanded by the Nurſes and People to own themſelves as skilful as other Apothecaries (who undertake any thing) that they may not forfeit their Buſineſs.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Theſe honeſt Apothecaries it ſeems are the leaſt skilful, or elſe it could not go againſt their Conſciences to own themſelves as wiſe as others. But it is pity, they ſhould be ſo forced into Buſineſs by their Cuſtomers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0194501100:20"/>the honeſt Doctors would willingly take it off their honeſt Hands. A gain,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That to live themſelves, they muſt endanger the Life of their Cuſtomer; give more than they would uſe themſelves in the ſame Caſe. They reflect with Horror at firſt, that they violate the Laws of their Country; ſubject to Fines, adjudged Felons, if they miſtake the Virtue or Doſe of the Medicines; obliged to ſet exorbitant Prices to the Poor and Servants, that the Wealthy may not diſcern the Difference: they are in the ſad Condition of the <hi>French</hi> King, in the abſurd Deſcription in King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was wont to make his Meals on the raw Limbs of his poor Subjects.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This is a ſad Character of the <hi>honeſt</hi> Apothecarys, that they are ſuch Sinners againſt their own Conſciences. I cannot underſtand how they came to be in ſo much Favour with the Diſpenſary, as to be ſtill termed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, unleſs it be for fetching or carrying, or for their Ignorance, whereby it is ſuppoſed they will be capable of doing their Duty, or rather the Doctors leſs hurt in Practice: Or is it likeneſs-ſake? But to add to their Crimes, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly devour the People alive, which if it be true, it is a Sign their Conſciences are not much concerned; and what are the reſt if the honeſt are ſo bad? Yet I can hardly believe, any ever made this Confeſſion. But further they ſay (if we may believe the Merchant)</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That the odd Confuſion of their Buſineſs perplexes them, to be one Hour wiping the bliſtered Part, and clapping on Melilot, then giving a Clyſter; next conſidering what to adviſe in a malignant Fever, then in the Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Child. The laſt muſt be done by the baſeſt Perfidiouſneſs of ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the File, this or that Phyſician's Bill they imagine to hit the Caſe, and ſave him the Trouble of ſeeing the Patient.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Still more Commendations of the honeſt Apothecaries, ſure theſe are ſome near the College, perfidious in ſtealing Bills off the Files; no, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Crime lies in ſaving the Doctor the Trouble, I would ſay Profit, of ſeeing the Patient: but why he muſt ſteal a Bill for a convulſive Child rather than any other Caſe, I don't underſtand, unleſs this Merchant's Talent lies in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Convulſions. But if the Confuſion of the Buſineſs ſo perplexes them, why have the Doctors ſo perplexed it? why have they never called for the Surgeons, or Butchers to take off the Skins of the Patients, and ſupply them with Melilot, and ſome fitter Perſons to adminiſter behind? But if theſe things are ſo great, and perplexing a Confuſion, why does the Diſpenſary undertake the ſame?</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But 'tis obvious (he goes on) the prodigious Number of Apothecaries will in a few Years naturally increaſe to more than twice as many, and ſo on; will oblige them to increaſe the greater vent of Phyſick, and higher Prices; they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0194501100:21"/>will not be wanting in perpetual Incroachments on the Faculty, they will be plying to raiſe and ſupport their Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will aſſume the cure of many thouſands yearly that would have been ſooner well without Phyſick; they will ſtruggle firſt with their own Fraternity, then the Members of the College, except their Confederates; they will not bear or commend any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but where Phyſick is ordered every Hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> 'Tis the Number of Apothecaries ſticks in this Tradeſman's Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, more than their Honeſty, he plainly ſhews, not becauſe they will be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Porters and raiſe the Rates of Drugs, but becauſe they will encroach on the Faculty, and get the Credit of many Cures, which were done merely by not killing, by which ſome Doctors might have raiſed a conſiderable Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>But whether they will have the wit to learn of the Doctors, to ſtruggle with then own Fraternity, I queſtion, and of which this is meant, the honeſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries or the others: but if they grow ſo numerous, and the College take no Care to enter Auxiliaries, I fear they will be too hard for the College, both honeſt and diſhoneſt too, if their Intereſt ingage them againſt all. But ſtill to inhance the Crimes of the (Honeſt) Apothecaries.<q>
                  <p>They will not ſuffer any Character of a Phyſician to paſs without an Allay or Antidote, who will not juſtify his Practice, and all his Medicines with the Air and Aſſurance of a Common Knight of the Poſt, and take the Death of the Patient on himſelf. Any Citizen who will think, may diſcern the Reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Diſſenſions of the College: one Party would raiſe its Reputation by ſerving the Publick faithfully, the other oppoſe all Projects of that kind to merit the Favour of the Apothecaries.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtates from their own Profeſſion are not to be informed that the Dignity of the Faculty muſt ſink, when they are forced to delude the People by applauding the unskilful or pernicious Treatment; and the Doctor for his Fee has the Reproaches of the Houſe and Funeral, when he dares not inform them the Patient had the fatal Stroak already given him, that the miſtake of the Apprentice in ſubſtituting one thing for another, or a wrong Proportion was the true Cauſe of a violent not natural Death. When we rarely treat a Diſtemper at its beginning, commonly the only time to interpoſe between Nature and the Diſeaſe to any purpoſe, are called to no purpoſe in the end, when all is in Confuſion the Vigor of Nature ſpent, or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with as many Doſes as Hours in 8 or 10 Days, and chiefly imployed in worn out and vitiated Conſtitutions.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> All Apothecaries are certainly wicked Fellows, if the honeſt ones are ſo bad, and the word Honeſt has indeed loſt its value; but they do but imitate the Doctors, who will not give them a good Character, unleſs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0194501100:22"/>they will comply with their Intereſt. But it is a great Scandal to the College that they ſuffer ſuch Members amongſt them, that have no more Faith or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thin Knights of the Poſt; that will juſtify what they dont know, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apothecaries Medicines and Honeſty: and the Doctors are imprudent too as well as wicked, or elſe they never would take the Deaths of the Patients on themſelves, or the Cure of them they know paſt cure. But it is not ſo obvious to the Citizens, that the Diſpenſary Doctors are all ſuch as would raiſe their Reputation only by faithfully ſerving the Publick; and that all the reſt oppoſe all ſuch Deſigns to get the Favour of the Apothecaries; that they are all baſe Apoſtates from their Profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I think it would ſhew but little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in a Phyſician after his Patient's Death, to tell the Patient's Friends he was killed, or incurable before he undertook him, or that the Medicines were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good, and that the Boy miſtook, when of ſuch things (tho they too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen) the Doctor is commonly ignorant. But when this honeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant was well enough to go abroad, he tells us,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That he was recommending the Advantages of the Diſpenſary, and the Integrity of the Phyſicians Subſcribers, but was ſurprized to hear many expreſs a Prejudice againſt it, without deſiring to know the Deſign of it; a notable Company about a Tea-table had been exclaiming, and ſaid, theyd go the old way till it came more in faſhion, ſince they did not know how many had been killed by the Apothecaries, they were eaſy not to find out new Occaſions of Trouble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Theſe were Merchants no doubt of the old Company, that were contented to trade upon the old Foundation, they had ſettled their Heads by a Diſh or two of Tea, and were willing to ſee others make out their Pretenſions. They were not willing to accuſe the Apothecaries of Murder, unleſs they could prove it, leſt they ſhould bring themſelves into Trouble. But,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'In other Viſits, he was <hi>ſtartled</hi> at the many ſcandalous Reports againſt the Subſcribers to the Diſpenſary. The firſt, ſays he, they contemned as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and ſenſeleſs Impoſtures; they, had too much <hi>Poetry</hi> in them for Truth. The other appeared ridiculouſly little, and very eaſily refuted. That their Phyſick is as dear as the Apothecaries, when we experience the Difference of 18 or 19 in 20 Shillings, their Goodneſs juſtified by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers Care in the Choice of every Drug, which they buy at the higheſt Prices; their Reputation anſwerable for every defect. That they have not Servants ſufficient, when they can increaſe their Number; and the want of Hands ſuppoſes the growing Buſineſs equal to defray the charge of more. But if the Subſcribers want the Univerſity Education or Capacity for their Employment, they may conſult the Apothecaries Liſt of the College, and find better if they can. If they deſtroy all the Patients, and the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0194501100:23"/>and their Confederates never want Succeſs, the want of Advocates will prevent the Trial, and nonſuit the Debate. If the Remedies are not good, the abuſed People will ſeaſonably complain; if they have no Buſineſs, the Diſpenſary will have none, and will be but a Collection of Pots and Glaſſes, and the Servants ſufficient to ſhew the uſeleſs Repoſitory.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Merchant in his further Adventures, meets with <hi>ſtartling Reperts</hi> againſt the Diſpenſary, no doubt he is concerned in ſupplying them with Drugs. I could wiſh he had given us the Poetical ones, they might have been a Diverſion, if not by their Wit, yet by their Folly; but what is the matter? Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ſo contemptible now, which before he boaſted of in the Diſpenſary as a Qualification with an Emphaſis, <hi>even Poetry,</hi> to bring up the Rear in thoſe that commend or belong to a Phyſician; now Poetical and Falſe go together. But he ſhould have confuted theſe great and harder Objections, as well as he has the little ones, to which he has anſwered very well, if the Merchant can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch what he has ſaid, that they will always ſell at the rate ſet down, which I am ſure will be leſs than they coſt.</p>
            <p>That the Diſpenſary always employ thoſe that have Skill, Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> or ſome other Apothecary-Doctors among them to buy the Drugs, and not truſt their Boys. That they will confeſs every defect: That their growing Buſineſs ſhall not perplex them, as it does the Apothecaries. That their Members, whether they came from the Shop, or the Schools, have Univerſity Learning, and as much Capacity for Phyſicians as they pretend to. That they will not deſtroy ſo many Patients as Apothecaries and other Doctors. But above all, that the Patients will be ſenſible of the Abuſes in Phyſick, and always complain when abuſed.</p>
            <p>But he tells us further.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That the People will in a little time apprehend, that their Intereſt as to Health and Expence is the Subject of the Controverſy, and that every one is both Judg and Party, and can give a definitive Sentence as far as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And here is no Law to be enacted by Majority of Voices, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to be put on the Liberty of any particular Perſon; he need not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a childiſh Dread, as if he were to be kidnapt away.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>To be plain, I am afraid the People will not ſoon experience that their Health and Expence, but their Expences, is the Subject of the Controverſy; but we know every one is not capable of being a Judg, or ſo unhappy as to be a Party. The People do not ſee the Depths of Satan in theſe things, and whence the fair Invitations proceed.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, we do not come to impoſe on you, you are at your Liberty, you need not be afraid of us, we come to ſeek your Health, and to do for you that which others cannot: Gentlemen, take our Remedies, our famous Orvie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0194501100:24"/>and other <hi>Arcanas</hi> at a very ſmall Price; here you have the whole Pack of 12 Remedics for the Price of one Shilling, which is inconſiderable to ſo great Benefits you will receive thereby; we are to be ſpoken with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is plauſible, and takes even upon a Stage. <hi>Tom. Saffold</hi> by repeated Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Aſſurances got an Eſtate. But,</p>
            <q>
               <p>'The Apothecaries (he tells us) complain with no Decorum, and the worſt Grace imaginable: You (to pleaſe the People) make your ſelves like the Apothecaries, you are become Doctor-Apothecaries; they have been theſe 40 years Apothecary-Doctors.'</p>
               <p>'But the Doctors reſtore the antient and cautious Practice, by providing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factual Remedies, and preventing deadly Miſtakes.'</p>
               <p>'The Apothecary leaves his concern to the wholeſale Trade and his Boy, is always abroad giving Advice. Can any two things be more alike in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance? Can they be juſtly diſpleaſed with you, who give your Care and Countenance to the trade of making Medicines, as the Apothecary in return puts a value upon yours, in pleaſing himſelf with the Practice of Phyſick?'</p>
               <p>'They reply, they are forced to it by the Peoples Importunity; ſo you are to ſend your Preſcriptions to the College, by thoſe who like a good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine at the intrinſick value: they are afraid the Diſpenſary will ruin the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries Trade, who are every day induſtriouſly deſtroying your Profeſſion. You are invaded with vaſt Numbers like a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Army, who ſlay without Quarter, reſerving a few Slaves to be cut off, if they bear not their Chains eaſily, or ſcruple any work they are put upon.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Apothecaries are graceleſs Fellows, they don't uſe the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum they ought in comparing the Doctors to themſelves, and do not handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh between Doctor- Apothecaries and Apothecary-Doctors; but it is certain, they both not only act after the like Method, but for the ſame Ends endeavour to pleaſe the People; and if the Doctor-Apothecaries reſtore the antient Practice, they do but imitate the Apothecary-Doctors, in taking care of the Preparation, as well as the Adminiſtration of Medicines: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either do enough to prevent all deadly miſtakes, is much to be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>The Apothecary leaves his concern to his Boy, but is ſeldom without the overſight, and aſſiſtance of his Man, who underſtands his Buſineſs, as well as the Doctor's Man at the College, or St. <hi>Martins-Lane.</hi> The one may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well do one Matter's Buſineſs, as well as the other ſerves 46: And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtands Pharmacy better than any of the 46 Doctors, not excepting him who was bred under the acute Maſter at <hi>Worceſter.</hi> But it is pity, either of them are forced to ſo much Buſineſs. If I could perſuade People to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0194501100:25"/>and Sobriety, they ſhould not ſo complain of much Buſineſs forced upon them.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why the Apothecary-Doctors value the Doctor-Apothecaries Buſineſs, <hi>&amp; Vice verſa,</hi> no doubt is, becauſe it is good to have two Strings to one Bow, or to have Cuſtomers come in at both Doors.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor-Apothecaries ſell Medicines at the Intrinſick Value, which the Apothecary-Doctors cannot afford: but if the Doctor-Apothecaries would alſo ſell Advice at the Intrinſick Value, they would certainly ruin their Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts; they are alike Fiſhers, but with different Baits, one catches by a Pretence of Advice at the Intrinſick Value, <hi>viz.</hi> little or nothing, but makes them pay ſo much the more for the Medicines; the other the Medicines almoſt at Intrinſick Value, <hi>viz.</hi> little or nothing, but expects his Gain in the Fees: and which Bait will take beſt being doubtful, they are between Hopes and Fear whoſe endeavours will ruin the other. But the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Army of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries makes the <hi>Swede</hi> tremble, yet encouraged by good Generals, they are not without hopes of Victory, and Reſolution never to be taken Priſoners.</p>
            <q>
               <p>'But (in other Converſations he ſays) he had better Succeſs, he perſwaded not a few to conſult thoſe of the Society at the approach of the Spring, and has had their Thanks, with large accounts of the difference of the old and new Practice of Phyſick. So many Converts in my Neighbourhood brought on me the Reſentments of my former Apothecary.'</p>
               <p>'He expoſtulated to me the ill Conſequence to their Trade, with bitter and envenomed Reflections on the Diſpenſary, and the Promoters of it. You ſhall judg from his manner of arguing, We govern all the Families; they believe us in every thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Men are abroad, or not in the Sick-Chamber, we recommend whom we pleaſe, and decry the oppoſite Party: Do you believe we will ſpare any of them? and haſtily plucked out a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Liſt printed at the deſire of the Maſter and Wardens, where our honeſt Phyſicians are diſtinguiſhed by Marks from their Honeſt Slaves; which being promiſcuous in the College Order, he blundred thrice, and ſhewed for Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains thoſe of their own Confederacy. But after ſome time he recovered, and told me, they were reſolved to maintain the Reputation of what they had done many Years, ſince there have not been more than 5 Phyſicians raiſed but by ſerving us; We call them topping Phyſicians, becauſe we put them on the People as we pleaſe. There are of ſeveral Sortments and different Abilities, who paſs by our Artifices for the greateſt Men: Has not one riſen conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by our Favour, who has employed much of his time in writing 3 Folio Poems, exploded by his Brother Poets and Phyſicians for the vileſt Bombaſt, every Expreſſion relating to Phyſick or Philoſophy proved to be trifling, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and falſe, and judged ſo even by us? Do not ſeveral of the College come
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0194501100:26"/>over, and betray all that paſſes? The reſt are afraid, and dare not be honeſt and juſt to their Patients. Will we pardon him who cures a Fever for one or two Pounds, when our Friends will raiſe the Bill to 10, 20, or 40 Pounds? He that brings in the Fidler, will make him play what Tunes, and as oft as he pleaſes. Does the Diſpenſary pretend to impoſe on the Publick, that we are not uſeful out of our Shops; who give Clyſters, dreſs Blyſters, and bleed when it is eaſy? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would not farther concern my ſelf, but only put him in mind, that one Sex was accommodated without them, and the other was the buſineſs of the Surgeon, who attends to theſe and the greater Caſes of Surgery abroad, without impediment to any part of his Profeſſion. Beſides, Bliſters often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd or corroded, to evacuate more freely, require more than the common treatment. I had been made ſenſible how that excellent and moſt uſeful Art of Surgery was invaded by theſe bold pretenders to every thing they do not underſtand; they bleed, without ſuſpecting the Nerve or Artery may lie in the way. They apply to Inflammations and Tumors, and keep in the putrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till the ſinuous Fiſtula or rotten Bone gives pain loud enough to call for the Surgeon.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> This Merchant I perceive was Broker to the Company, or Spokeſman to perſwade the People to buy the Doctors Remedies, and had got, as he ſays, many promiſes to conſult them at the time when People are perſwaded they ought to take Phyſick whether they need it or no, which is certainly eaſy Practice; and no doubt the People had cauſe to thank him for adviſing them to thoſe that would give the leaſt: People that are well had certainly better pay for Advice to go to ſh—t when they have need, than for the directing a Purge or two; and they muſt needs find a difference in the Practice, that being eaſier than this.</p>
            <p>No wonder the Apothecary, like a covetous dependant Preacher, is angry at him that converts his Flock into another Fold, and he has verily a great capacity to decry or recommend, as the Share of the Fleece engages him; but tho he of all Men may beſt know the Honeſty and Capacity of a Phyſician, yet I readily believe he is not always infallible, but may miſtake the Marks (being but ſmall) of honeſt Phyſicians, and may readily take ſome of any Confederacy for Villains: but if there have not been more than five Villains rais'd by the Apothecaries, they are not ſo bad as I could have believed them, yet they are much to be blam'd for putting any villains o top on the People, or repreſenting little fellows for great Men, but eſpecially for recommending the care of the Lives of the ſober People to <hi>Poets,</hi> whoſe bombaſt fictions will never cure any conſiderable Diſeaſes, whether <hi>Arthurs,</hi> the <hi>Diſpenſaries,</hi> or <hi>John Junior</hi>'s, who tho the Qualifications may recommend them all to the filly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who love Conceits) for ingenious Men, yet Criticks will let neither go
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0194501100:27"/>without Cenſure, but ſoon diſcover where the Muſe was up too ſoon, and fell into ſome <hi>Supine Nod</hi> or other: or <hi>when his Spirits ſtagnate like a Flood;</hi> or when <hi>he blazons in dread ſmiles his hideous Form,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the College are ſure a wretched ſort of Men, that ſome betray the reſt, and the reſt dare not be honeſt and juſt; and the Apothecaries are very unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, that they will not pardon him that cures a Fever at 1 or 2 Pounds, they might have ſaid Guineas, when I know the moſt Fevers may be cur'd at half the Rate, and the Doctor be a Gainer: and I believe were there nothing but the Muſick it ſelf to recommend theſe Artiſts, there would but ſew dance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Diſpenſary Clyſter-Pipe, who I don't queſtion have their uſeful Men in their concern, not only to give Clyſters, dreſs Bliſter, and bleed when it is eaſy, but alſo to accommodate even the one Sex when they have a mind to a Jigg. I am glad to hear the Merchant ſpeaks honourably of the Surgeons, and with ſome concern for their intereſt; and grant that they may mind buſineſs abroad without impediment to buſineſs at home: It is certainly as much the Surgeons concern to take care of the Pharmaceutick part as it is the Diſpenſaries, ſince they cannot truſt the Apothecaries. I am pleas'd that they are ſenſible the Surgeons are invaded by the Apothecaries as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it ſhews they are grown better natur'd ſince they themſelves perſecuted that Party for interloping: but the huge Ruſſian Army of the Apothecarys makes them willing to ſpeak the Poles fair, and not pretend to turn Dr. Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too, as well as Dr. Apothecaries; If they had, I ſhould have blam'd them for ſuppoſing the Nerves and Arteries lie between the Veins and the Skin, or that there is any need of cutting through both ſides of the Vein, or that Tumors are fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous before they are open, or that rotten Bones, or purulent Tumors are moſt painful.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But after various fortune abroad (ſays he) I was to meet a ſelect Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Merchants and other eminent Citizens. I determin'd to ask their Aſſiſtance and Counſel: I ſhow'd them your Papers, and laid before them the Informations relating to the College, and our own Intereſt: ſome were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Treaties abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at mine and our Friend's requeſt we came to debate of our own immediate concern. I was deſired to give you a further trouble, to remove the common <hi>Opprobrium</hi> on the Profeſſion, that it wants Certainty, and acts often by conjecture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that more ſcandalous, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarys ſeeing the Patient and you at the bed ſide, is able to give Phyſick himſelf. And (after our aſſertion or the Cheapneſs of the beſt Medicines, and ſome conteſts about it) that you would, as in our Papers for ſale by the Candle, give a pretty near eſtimate of the Value of every Preparation, and Compoſition or Simple now us'd in Phyſick. We muſt wait for this Account, on which the whole Controverſy depends; but the Company would not doubt of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0194501100:28"/>the eaſy prices of the moſt effectual Remedies (as are fit for the Uſe of the Prince, now the regard of all <hi>Europe</hi>) many of us having us'd of ſeveral Kinds, of which the Doſe was of no great Value.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Theſe were all ſelect Merchants of this new Company (we muſt ſuppoſe) becauſe their Counſel and Aſſiſtance was ſo neceſſary, and Intereſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman and his Friends were moſt diligent, they were for home Treaties, <hi>de laribus &amp; focis;</hi> but that trouble the Gentleman gave 'em, I believe will indeed be found one, 'ere the <hi>Opprobria</hi> of the Profeſſion are removed. That it is uncertain and conjectural in great part, is moſt certain, and granted by all knowing and modeſt Phyſicians; but it's certainly aſſerted by none ſo much as the Ignorant, and thoſe that are willing to deceive the People. I don't ſee how it ſhould be thought the greater Scandal, that the Apothecaries by ſeeing the Patient and Docto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s at the bedſide can become able to give Phyſick; for were it ſo, it would argue the Artiſt certain, and the Art eaſy: and that all that have to do with the Sick ſhould be able to give Phyſick, would certainly not only be a credit to the Profeſſion, but ſafe to the Patient; for one may recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy anothers miſtakes. But I believe here lies the ſcandal, that the Apothecary being skilful ſometimes is forc'd to diſcover the Doctor's defects in Care, in Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks, or in Pharmacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which laſt I think they have diſcovered ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance enough, and that they have not the beſt Medicines, their <hi>Pharmacopeia</hi> being their ſtandard, which is one of the worſt Collections in the World. But it is pleaſant that they talk of ſelling their Medicines by inch of Candle. And I believe we may wait a great while, 'ere theſe Merchants will give us an eſtimate of the value of every Preparation, Compoſition and Simple us'd in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; it will be ſo laborious and difficult a work, they will not have time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. If the whole Controverſy depends upon this, it will never be at an end: but the Company have been us'd ſo kindly in many things, they don't doubt of eaſy prices.</p>
            <p>If they are not kind to thoſe that are to carry on the Trade, it would be ſtrange. But that nothing but ſuch cheap Phyſick ſhould be fit for his Majeſty, looks as if they thought him poor, or not to deſerve the more precious Remedies, or at leaſt would have him furniſht out of their ſtock. But he goes on,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'After their lamenting the Poor, and the vile treatments of others, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved they would make their Acquaintance ſenſible of the generous Deſign of the College, and engage them to the moſt induſtrious publication of its Uſe, the only <hi>Panacea</hi> to the Sick; they would not doubt to convince the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and heedleſs Oppoſers.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If theſe Gentlemen had not made ſo great a noiſe about the Poor, and ſhewn ſuch great induſtry in inviting to buy their <hi>Panaceas,</hi> one might have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0194501100:29"/>believed ſomething of their Generoſity. But Mankind now adays are not ſo immoderately deſirous to ſerve one another, much leſs thoſe that have moſt need; we cannot but in charity think theſe Merchants are moſt willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their own Poor, who are not ſo hard to be convinc'd of any thing that may tend to their benefit. But,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'He goes on to tell us what the Apothecary muſt do, he muſt be obliged to keep his Shop, that all his Medicines may be made at home, and diſpens'd with his own hand, or under his careful inſpection, that his Apprentice may be imployed to learn his Trade, and be taken from the giddy ambition of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Profeſſion a little too far removed from his. That our Servants ſhall be ſent for the Phyſick, and Directions ſhall be left at our Houſes by the proper Hands; each of us ſending our Porters, the hurry and confuſion may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the Apothecaries and then Servants, by which many Patients Phyſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convey'd at one time, the deadly accidents that often happen may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our Meſſenger will find the Shop ſedately forwarding their Affair, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will wait the Mixture for his Maſter, by which the Poſſibility of a Miſtake will be prevented.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It is very hard that the Apothecary ſhould be oblig'd to keep his Shop, ſince the Doctor is reſolvd to ſend all his Bills to the Diſpenſary, and to underſell him in Medicines. I know no way the Apothecary can take, but to underſell the Doctor in Advice, and he may truſt his Man to make up his Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's as well as the Doctor can his at the Diſpenſary, the Caſe being the ſame. The Profeſſion of Phyſick, which the Apothecarys Boy is ſo ambitious t<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o ape, I agree has been too far removed from Pharmacy; and the Doctors do well in aping the Boy that would bring them together, which ought not to be ſeparate. But Porters, tho they may carry greater burdens of Phyſick at once, are not the fitteſt Meſſengers to convey the remedies to the Sick; he that makes up a Bill, may ſometimes ſave a Liſe by ſeeing the Patient. I have known one loſt 'ere now, which had the Apothecary's Boy ſeen, the Patient would have been ſaved.</p>
            <p>But if theſe things were done, he further adds: <q>
                  <p>The College will be ſafe from the temptations they now lie under, and from being in ſo large Numbers debaucht from their Virtue and indiſpenſible Duty to their Patients; and as the preſent 1000 (<hi>viz.</hi> Apothecaries) have two or three Apprentices each, which multiplying in proportion muſt raiſe the Prices of Phyſick, and the Quantity, and Induſtry of giving more, to the Ruin of their Credit with the People, there is no other method to preſerve themſelves. The Families will then make choice of a Phyſician from the viſible Succeſs of his Art; and not with the greateſt ſtupidneſs ask the Apothecary to bring one, ſince from your Members you are forc'd to make the greateſt profit of every Patient,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0194501100:30"/>which inclines him to a Phyſician moſt uſeful in that Caſe. 'Twas reſolv'd after youre anſwer of the Prices, to oblige the Phyſician to rate the Preſcript ſent to the Apothecary at the faireſt Profit, to be paid at furtheſt after the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and to prevent the ſipping of Cordials, and Pearl Juleps, as Uſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baugh at the Coffeehouſes, upon every little humour of taking, encouraged by the mean and vile cuſtoms of going upon tick till Chriſtmas.</p>
                  <p>A Modeſt Gentleman gave his aſſent with ſome doubt of ſucceſs, but he would propoſe theſe things to the beſt Advantage.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> 'Tis a thouſand pities the College have ſo many temptations to debauch them from their duty to their Patients. But it ſeems the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as bad as they are, have been the happy occaſion of reforming the honeſt part, by ſetting them an example of preſcribing their own Remedies; and 'tis but juſt the Doctors ſhould have a little Concern leſt their increaſe in Numbers ſhould ruin them. But yet the Doctors are ſo ſenſible of the Debauchery of the Apothecaries as well as of their own, that they dare not truſt them with the recommendation of a Phyſician, leſt they ſhould not recommend one of the honeſt part who would ſend the Bills to the College. The viſible Succeſs of his Art is certainly the beſt Character whereby one may chooſe a Phyſician; but if this were the only rule, none would have ever been choſe, for no Man has ſucceſs either in Curing or Killing till he has had ſome experience, which all our Doctors at firſt can't but want. Nor can the Apothecary be ſure who he ſhall have the beſt ſucceſs with till he has tried him, unleſs he had preingag'd the young Doctor to preſcribe largely, on condition he will cry him up, which is a Practice I muſt confeſs I have heard of. But how the new Company will enable or oblige the Old, and all Interlopers, to rate the Preſcripts, I can't ſee, or how they can pretend to it, with better reaſon than the Apothecary might rate the Doctors Fees. But if they could oblige the Patients to pay ready money, and leave the vile Cuſtom of going upon tick, not only the Apothecary but honeſt part of the Doctors would be oblig'd; yet if it were to be only at the recovery, none of the Merchants I believe would keep open ſhop long. How they will be able to prevent the People from ſipping other Cordials or Uſquebaugh when they have a mind to it, or the Apothecary from ſelling of it, a modeſt Gentleman may well doubt. But he gives us ſomething conſiderable as ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> Now ſtarts up at laſt a <hi>Lyncean</hi> Merchant, that can ſee the Men at their Bottle between two Stone Walls, and he doubts how the Wit and Banter of theſe <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Phanaticks will be repelled: But I think this Gentlemans Opticks not ſo admirable; tho he could ſee ſo far, he cannot ſee very near; for childiſh wantonneſs of Thought, and Deviations from good Senſe are very uncouth Characters of Wit and Learning, and very unlikely means to bring Men into eſteem; and the Signature ought to be taken not from ſuch Qualifications, or any of equal Importance, but ſomething above want of Senſe. The skilfulleſt Pilot, and moſt grave and learned Judg is certainly to be truſted with the Ship and Cauſe: And the manner of the Doctor's weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caſe, whether with Wit or none, is to be conſidered by thoſe that have Wit enough to do it, and how induced by Apothecaries, Viſitants, or whether by the Brokers to the old or new Company; which done, it will be better gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who is likely to merit applauſe; and he that does indeed do ſo, will moſt put down the Infamy Phyſicians have ſo often merited. But,</p>
            <p>How to keep People from doſing themſelves, and ſo making work for the Doctors, I do not know, as long as there are ſo many Medicines expoſed to ſale. That the Apothecaries ſhould hinder Diſſections, to me is a Myſtery, if the Friends are willing: or how the Doctors are ſo ſure to find the Boluſſes ſticking in the Paſſages of the Heart, or the Viſcera corrupted, I don't know: ſuch things I have known as poſitively aſſerted by them, as if they had been Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or had the famed Eyes of the <hi>Lynx,</hi> but Diſſection has diſcovered their Vanity. If all Merchants will controul their Families by the Direction of the Diſpenſary, and perſuade their Friends to their Reſolutions, the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries will ſoon be outed. Well but he goes on. <q>'When we were about to part, one of the Society, that had been ſilent ſome time, expreſſed himſelf with ſome heat from the relation he had to ſome of the Faculty; Let us not

Shall we look on unconcerned, when the Faculty and our ſelves are enſlaved, and oppreſt by the Number of the Apothecaries, originally their Servants? What is the Myſtery, but a Mechanick and handicraft Trade? They act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by the Ordinance and Direction of the Phyſician; the Medicines are all from their Appointment, the Drugs poudered, boiled, diſtilled, and mixed by their Order; What Books or Languages are underſtood by them, but the Diſpenſatory, or Receit Book? The Cook, Confectioner, and Perfumer have as much pretence to Learning, or the Knowledg of the Uſes of what they prepare. Have not our Servants the Skill to make up our Domeſtick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, many of them the ſame as theirs? The Under-Servant to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's Laboratory, while he cleanſes the Glaſſes, attends the Fires, ſpeedily diſcerns the Mechanick Part; tho the Deſign and Proceſs were given by the incomparable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> or the Faculty, and the Uſes only known to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Phyſician.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The whole Company of theſe Merchants without doubt were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Faculty, or they had not been ſo warm in the Concern: But this Gentleman had been long muſing, and he thought it neceſſary to add a little heat at laſt, it being the only Opportunity to raiſe the ſinking Reputation of thoſe, who have ſo long profeſſed themſelves one of the moſt uſeful, as well as learned Profeſſions; but I find the chief Cauſe of his heat was, the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of their common Intereſt, which I the rather believe, becauſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the reſt, that it is the number of the Apothecaries that is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and not the Honeſty of thoſe raſcally Mechanicks formerly their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; <hi>Davus perturbat omnia.</hi> But I muſt beg the Doctor's Pardon a little: the preſent Venders of Medicines were not Doctors Servants, tho that was the Original of the Trade; but thoſe Doctors, whoſe Servants turned Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were a ſort of Men who very well underſtood Pharmacy, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſpenſers did not till a few broken Apothecaries came to be Doctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. But the old Blades thought handy works no Diſgrace: <hi>Paracelſus</hi> the proudeſt of them thought the higheſt Title he could bear, was that of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of Mechanical Arcanas.</hi> If the preſent Apothecaries do nothing but by the Ordinance and direction of the Phyſician, why do they complain? but perhaps it is not the honeſt Phyſician's Orders they act by: I am ſure it is not the Orders of the skilful they obey in their Receit Book; if they had, there would not have been ſo many inſignificant and fooliſh Medicines there, and ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0194501100:33"/>few good ones, nor the <hi>ſecundum Artem</hi> wholly left to thoſe ignorant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, in which there often lies more than in the Receit it ſelf. But as to Language, I will engage to bring Apothecaries that underſtand more, even <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than ſome of the Learned Doctors of the Diſpenſary, beſides other liberal Sciences. Many of them, it muſt be confeſſed, are ignorant enough both in Language, and Cookery; but what ſhall be ſaid of the Cook, Confec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, or Perfumer, that knows not the uſes of what he prepares, or of the Wit that can ſuppoſe them ſuch ignorant Artiſts? Nor I believe would the Gentleman eſteem the Mechanick Part of Chymiſtry ſo very eaſy, if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it: for I muſt tell him there is more Art even in making a Fire than he ſeems to imagine; and the incomparable <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> had not he and his Operators too underſtood the Mechanick Part of ſome Proceſſes better than the Faculty, he would never have hid his Deſign in them, whatever the Faculty might by chance have ſtumbled upon. But the Doctor proudly aſſuming to the Faculty the ſole Knowledg of the uſes of Medicines, thereby ungratefully denies it that excellent Perſon, for the pleaſure he created them in the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be ſingly had given the Nation, by making it not wholly ignorant in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy, the chief Baſis of Medicine.</p>

            <p>SO much for the Merchant's Letter, or the Doctor in diſguiſe. We come now to the unmasked Phyſician's Anſwer. Let us ſee if we can find any thing more like the Product of a Pen uſed to preſcribe the beſt Medicines; and he anſwers the Drugſter as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'Sir, I perceive you lay the greateſt ſtreſs on the laſt enquiry of the low Prices of Medicines, becauſe you obſerve that the large Bills of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary are the beſt Argument with the People of his Ability to adviſe; and while they believe the Diſeaſe is treated very much by gueſs, they are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſolicitous who throws the Dice for their Lives: but you rather make choice of one, who has made it his only Buſineſs, has ſtudied, and practiſed all the Artifices of making them run to his purpoſe, than any common Hand.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the large Bills of the Apothecaries are the beſt Argument with the People of the Apothecaries Ability to adviſe, I do not ſee how ſo much ſtreſs can be laid on the Doctors ſelling a few Medicines at low Prices; that which argues the Ability of the Apothecary, ſhould methinks alſo argue the Skill of the Doctor: but the Doctor here talks too much like an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſomething elſe. It cannot be denied that both Doctors and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0194501100:34"/>uſe their Medicines very much like <hi>Dice;</hi> but whether the Doctor or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary has got more Artifices to make 'em run to his purpoſe, is not eaſy to ſay: I believe both have more than are good, he that pretends to ſell cheap does it to get more Cuſtomers; he that ſells dear, does it to get the more Money, and both have the ſame Deſign. But it is very true, there are ſome uncommon Gameſters.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'Further (ſays he) you will not deny that every Art has the means to attain its End. This is obvious in Manufactures, which are made better or worſe, according to the Skill of the Artificer. There are other Arts, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is periſhable from Cauſes above the Power and Controul of the Art, which Events are not imputable to the Artiſt. Navigation will conduct a Ship to the Port, but Storms, Rocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may loſe the Ship. The Husbandman and Gardiner act with proſpect of Succeſs, but extreme Rains, Drought and Blaſts deſtroy their hopes. The Phyſician pretends to know with as much certainty how animal Life may be preſerved, and by what means endangered, as they the Health and Growth of Vegetables. You may make an eſtimat to what Proportion animal Life may be prolonged, by obſerving that the Periods of the Lives of many Quadrupeds and Birds are ſuppoſed to be diſtinctly known.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Phyſician could have been contented to have his Art thought as certain as others, and he might have perſuaded the Merchants that ſo it is, if he had not unluckily dropped that modeſt Word <hi>pretends,</hi> which makes ſome think, it is indeed but a Pretence. But I hope he would not cunningly inſinuate, that the bare Suppoſition of the Knowledg of the Periods of the Lives of Beaſts and Birds, is the way to eſtimate what Doctors can do. Let us hear what has been ſuppoſed in this matter.</p>

            <p>But I hope he would not have the Merchants think, the new Diſpenſary-Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors can make Mens Lives as long as theſe ſuppoſed Periods. If they could ſo do, they would be rare Fellows, but bitterly peſtered with Practice. <q>
                  <p>'But yet Man's (he ſays) is the longeſt Period, and from <hi>Galen</hi>'s Obſervation that of the <hi>Britains.</hi> If in Navigation, the Veſſel muſt be moved by the Tide and Winds, and turned by the Rudder to a certain courſe: The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Body act as mechanically by the natural Neceſſity in Health; ſo in the Appearances of Diſeaſes, the Humours are by a natural tendency moved

               <hi>Remark.</hi> Either the Doctor is miſtaken, or <hi>Virgil,</hi> a better Poet than any of them, whatever <hi>Galen</hi> is: but under all, the Doctor's Intent is to perſuade us, that Diſpenſary Phyſicians can prolong Life. That Phyſicians do ſo truly define and deſcribe Diſeaſes, or have ſuch certain Experiences of their Cures, I muſt deny: Authors differ; if they did not, yet Men of great Buſineſs read but little, and remember leſs, and he's a very rare Fellow indeed, that has a Promptuary in his Noddle to ſerve him on all Occaſions; but whatever may have been done by former Phyſicians, ours are <hi>quot Homines tot Sententiae</hi> (except in ſome very common Caſes) both in their Definitions, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions for Diſeaſes, as any one will find that ſhall conſult divers Phyſicians ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, and compare their Accounts of a Diſeaſe and Preſcriptions for it; one will ſay 'tis this, another that; one will preſcribe one thing, another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But he ſays farther,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'You cannot doubt the efficacy of the Inſtruments in Phyſick, when in many Caſes the rich Cordials given improperly, or in large Quantities, act as Poiſons, and then in a little longer time as viſibly deſtroy; when the over doſing Vinous, or other Spirits, fire and inflame the Blood and Spirits: Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſtop the Motions, the Bark checks the ferment of a Fever, which cannot be cured but by Expulſion of the Venom: the effects of Vomits, Purges, Diaphoreticks, are owned by the vulgar Experience. The late but ſurer force of Labour, Temperance, Reſt, have been formerly owned in the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Diſeaſes. They are now rejected as the moſt nauſeous Phyſick, and the moſt difficult to be complied with: I need not acquaint you with the Mineral Waters, which are able to cool, and dilute, and purify the Blood, after it has been heated and corrupted by modiſh Living. Nature diſcovers to the Phyſician its ſureſt Methods of diſmiſſing the moſt common Fevers, by Bleeding, Sweats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the more difficult, it gives Indications how it would be aſſiſted or directed; at leaſt our Magazines of Obſervations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſail to furniſh in all Caſes parallel to them.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> That even Cordials may ſo eaſily act as Poiſons, and deſtroy, methinks is no inviting Argument of the efficacy of Medicines; nor can this appear but from the Errors of Phyſicians, who have found it ſo, which is no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0194501100:36"/>great Credit. Tho the effects of vulgar Medicines are known, the Time and Caſe where ſuch effects ſhould be produced; is not ſo well perceived. Labour, Temperance, and Reſt are certainly excellent Preſervatives, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſeaſes cannot be uſed: When a Man cannot ſo much as ſit up, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him Labour; when he is delirious, to order him to go to Reſt, would be very good Phyſick, if he could take it; but it is indeed difficult to be complied with, barely by the Doctor's Order. It is not ſo certain to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whether, and when the Mineral Waters do good or hurt: It was the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> that they do more hurt than good, taking one time with another; and it ſeems to be the Opinion of one of his Scholars, that all the real Benefit got by drinking the Waters, comes merely from the large Quantities of Water taken, and not by the Minerals wherewith they are impregnated and defiled; and he adviſes Perſons rather to drink at ſome pure Spring. Letter to a Gentleman, of <hi>Alkaly</hi> and <hi>Acids, p. ult.</hi> But the Air, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Diverſion of thoſe Places, may add very much to the Health of the Perſons, which is uſed to be attributed ſolely to the Waters; tho all this would not cure a Man, whoſe Blood is corrupted. Nature's Indications are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved or underſtood by Phyſicians, or always followed; but the Mode Practice prevails above them all: And the Magazines of Obſervations are not always open, or reſorted to by Phyſicians; but while a Man is looking for a parallel Caſe, the Patient is often dead. A Phyſician ought to have a better Rule, than the running to his Study to know what to do, where he is not ſure to find a true Parallel; the Author might be miſtaken, and not give a true or faithful account: Authors are apt to be ſomewhat guilty of the Crime of the <hi>petty Sorcerers,</hi> who make their virulent Medicines all <hi>Panaceas,</hi> if you will believe the Catalogues of Cures confidently affirmed in the Bills; when very likely the Diſeaſe never was worſe, or ſo bad as they make it, if the matter of Fact related had any Truth in it at all. He goes on:</p>
            <p>
               <q>'But if the Patient is overheated, and ſurfeited by too many Medicines; if the ſalutary Looſeneſs be ſtopped too ſoon, the Humours fix by Opiates, or the Bark, it's imputable to the Adviſer, not to the Art, which has given the ſtricteſt cautions on the like Conjunctures. It is not a reproach to the Art, if there are wanting Remedies equal to the Rage or Violence of ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which will not wait the effect, or are above the Force of any known Drug that can be brought to oppoſe them, any more than to the Stateſman, General, or Counſellor, when he cannot always warrant Succeſs. When after the ſteady uſe of Liquors which give a briskneſs to, but inflame the Spirits, ſpend the Strength of the Blood by heating it, give Life a pleaſant but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Motion, the Liver and other Parts ſhall be made ſcirrous and abceſſed, the <hi>Omentum</hi> rotten, the Fibers flaccid, ſhall the Art be accuſed, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the Art of Medicine were ſo certain as the Doctor would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his hoped-for Patients, the Artiſt would not ſo often overheat, yea or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-cool, or ſurfeit his Patients by ſo many Medicines: It will certainly be the Advantage of every Artiſt to do his work with the feweſt Tools, all the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they give one another are hardly ſufficient, fixing of Humors is what a Chymiſt would be glad to ſee the Doctor perform. To ſuppoſe there are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies wanting to equal the Force of any Diſeaſe, is to reproach the Author of Nature as if he had not goodneſs enough to provide a Remedy for every evil, or as if his Goodneſs were not greater than all Evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and to excuſe the Artiſt who ought to be blam'd that he hath not found out ſufficient Remedies, but lazily leaves them unknown.</p>
            <p>Some of the Doctors themſelves are ſteady Drinkers, but I believe never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were found with ſcirrous Livers, rotten <hi>Omentums,</hi> or flaccid Fibers caus'd by the briskneſs of the Blood. But if all Artiſts may be accus'd of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, it ſignifies not much what the Art is ſuppos'd; 'tis the Artiſt, the Patient muſt ſtand or fall by. He farther ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That the tendences and events of the Symptoms, and the Iſſue of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe may be known, and a probable Prognoſtick given, is own'd by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of the common People to give their Opinions. How often have you believed the preſumptuous Valuer of himſelf, who doubts every ones knowledg but his own; when he has aſſur'd you, had he come ſooner the Patient had not died; that another would have expired the next Day, if his advice had been wanting? The Writers of Government prove the Maxims of State from the Axioms of Phyſick, that one Part overnouriſht, ſtarves and enervates the others: That when every Part diſregards the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Whole, its Diſſolution is as certain, as when every Part is vitiated in a ſhatter'd Conſtitution.'</q>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Doctor would fain raiſe the Reputation of Phyſicians with the People, particularly the credit of the new Shopkeepers, but he does it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Arguments; the forwardneſs of the common People to prognoſticate, or run to the Fortuneteller to know the Succeſs of their Amours, Law-ſuits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no very convincing Argument that their Oracle is not a Cheat: nor is their Faith in the preſumptuous Valuer of himſelf, who ſo poſitively decrees what would have, or not have been, if this, or that; any aſſurance that he is, or can be what he pretends. But I believe the Doctors may be certain enough in their Prognoſticks of the Body Politick; that if the Apothecarys be over nouriſht, they will ſtarve the Doctors; or if the Diſpenſary be over fed (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be) they will ſtarve the Apothecaries and other Doctors: and if every Part diſregard the Intereſt of the Whole, the College will ſoon be diſſolved, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0194501100:38"/>God grant, unleſs they will effectually reform. <hi>Amen.</hi> But the Doctor adds,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'If therefore a Phyſician is ſuppos'd to have learnt whatever has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the different Affections and Diſorders from Childhood to Old-age, of the Sexes in all the Circumſtances, how Seaſons and Climates alter us, what changes are made by all ſorts of Diet, to have noted the Uſe and Site of all Parts by Anatomy, the Virtue of Medicines by the trial Chymiſtry affords, but eſpecially the Hiſtories of the almoſt innumerable Diſeaſes given by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, their Cauſes, Acceſs, Progreſs, Events and Conſequents of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and all Medicines, when he reflects on them, and compares them nicely with the Caſe under his care, you will not oppoſe him to a Rival who has not had Philoſophical Education, or the knowledg of any Language in which Phyſick is treated. When you have determin'd what time is requir'd to collect from many Writers whatever is uſeful to the ſafe and ſucceſsful Practice of Phyſick, I would deſire you to ſtate the Years wherein any thing certain can be acquir'd from the Preſcripts of the Art, without the Reaſons given, or any regiſter of the Succeſs. When Nature throws off the Common Diſorders of it ſelf, and is able to bear any ſort of Phyſick, the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plies the Sick with Medicines he does not want, to pay for attending, magnifies the Diſeaſe, and his Skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe the moſt uſual Ilneſſes, the Phyſician ſhews his Art by prognoſticating with integrity the aſſur'd ſucceſs, which is a richer Cordial than the Shops afford, and merits his Reward. But when there ſhall be <hi>nodus vindice d gnus,</hi> when <hi>dubiis trepidat victoria pennis;</hi> when the Experienc'd Phyſician will doubt whether Nature acts to its own Preſervation, or wants the Aſſiſtance of Art, he will examine the Effects of one Medicine before he riſques the Uſe of others; the ignorant and leſs ſearful Adviſer will not loſe the Opportunity of filling the Patient, and the Chamber to his own advantage. Theſe are the Caſes in which all the ſevereſt, and moſt juſt Obſervations of the preſent and former Ages muſt be conſulted: the leaſt Errors make the Fever deadly, tho not to be diſcover'd but by the moſt conſummate Artiſt. They only can diſcern when Nature, attackt in all Parts, the Spirits waſted, and Blood exhauſted, is eaſily over-born by an active Cordial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The People indeed are ſatisfied with the Apothecarys skill, who hears the Phyſicians diſourſe upon the Diſeaſe. Will you imagine he deſigns the ſureſt Inſtruction to his Scholar, who will ſet up for a Maſter next hour? But he makes up the Note, and ſees the Operation. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument-maker, tho he make the Knife and Forceps, will not pretend to uſe them as the Surgeon. I will, after you have conſider'd it, deſire your Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether you would communicate a Specifick efficacious Medicine to the Apothecary, which he would inſtantly make up for every Cuſtomer in the ſame, or as he thinks not much differing Caſes: Will any Merchant or Artificer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0194501100:39"/>the ſecret of his Buſineſs? But we cannot diſcover our Secrets to any but our own Profeſſion, which is the manner of applying the Medicine to the latent exigence of the Diſeaſe. Some Fevers go off, being only undiſturbed, Water is the richeſt Cordial in others, and the rich Compoſition procures to others a certain Malignity. Will you value the Surgeon from the tipping of his Inſtruments, or from his Judgment and Steadineſs of Hand in uſing them? The moſt common and ſimple may have a better effect than the moſt pompous Apparatus. The few of our coſtly Ingredients have been kept in uſe to cover the Fraud of Exaction, but ſpecially becauſe we pleaſe our ſelves, that they are deſigned for the uſe of the <hi>Grand Monde,</hi> while we pity the little People, who we imagine cannot live without them. But Providence hath otherwiſe provided in its grand Hoſpital, we are upon the Level there. The Poor do not want ſo much as the Rich, but may have the moſt valued ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and the beſt Chymical or Galenical Preparations at an expence they, or their Patrons with an eaſy Charity may bear.'</q>

               <hi>Remark.</hi> A Phyſician that is not ſuppoſed, but has indeed learned all that has been obſerved of the Affections, and Diſorders of the Sexes in all Ages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that knows the Site and Uſe of all Parts by Diſſections, the Virtues of Medicines by what Chymiſtry can do, that has at his Fingers ends the Hiſtories of Diſeaſes given by Authors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Conſequences of all Methods and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and can compare them nicely on every occaſion, is <hi>rara Avis in Terra Medicorum,</hi> I dare ſay not ever ſeen in <hi>Warwick-Lane,</hi> any more than among the Gliſter-pipers: The Gentlemen have not many of them ſo much as look'd into ſome of theſe things; particularly <hi>Chymea,</hi> that coy colley-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Gentlewoman, has not been courted much by them for her Gifts: and he that ſhould inſinuate himſelf to be one of her Followers, would not be thought likely to have had Philoſophical, or Academical Education, which the Doctor is ſo willing to boaſt of againſt the Apothecaries. But I muſt needs ſay, neither of the Adverſaries have been grounded as they ought in Philoſophy, eſpecially the Experimental; but as being an Apothecary does not make a Man incapable of it, ſo being of the College, yea of the Diſpenſary, does not neceſſarily include it. Many Apothecaries have attained the Latin Tongue, and ſomething of Greek, before put Apprentice, and may improve in Language, and read the Secrets which the Doctors did; but if none of them had ſo done, there are Engliſh Books enough written by ſome of the Faculty, that could write in no other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.

As the Apothecary plies the Sick with Medicines he does not want, ſo the Doctor will not be wanting to write, where there is no need but of a Fee; or to viſit, and adviſe ſome little thing or other, that the Patient may not think he ſees him for nothing: he will alike magnify his Art, and the Diſeaſe, tho both be little, and will give that moſt rich Cordial of aſſured Succeſs, which is very commonly indeed the beſt Medicine he gives, and gets the willingeſt Fee by; which he knows better than to refund, when time has diſcovered his Aſſurance not well grounded. But there are knotty and doubtful Diſeaſes he confeſſes, even to the experienced Phyſician, when in fear he knows not whether he had beſt preſcribe or no; he wiſely thinks he does beſt that tampers leaſt, and would have the Patients think ſuch a one deſerves his Fee beſt that has troubled them leaſt.

            <p>be the Man; ſuch a one perhaps may diſcern when he has exhauſted the Blood, and waſted the Spirits, and Nature will be overborn by an active Cordial. But the Doctor is afraid the People will think the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries skilful (that Gentleman has aſſur'd us, his Maſter was not) by hearing the Doctor talk, and by making up his Medicines, and ſeeing their Operations; tho he aſſures us he has been careful leſt he ſhould give him any ſure Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but if his Inſtructions by his Practice be ſo fallacious, he that deſigns to be skill'd will take a better Method to learn than the Sight of the fearful or confident Doctor's Practice can be, whoſe Inſtruments could he but know their uſe, as well as the Surgeon does his, there were more occaſion of Caution who looks on. There has been no great danger of Apothecaries learning
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0194501100:41"/>Efficacious Specificks of the Doctors, ſince they practiſe by the Diſpenſatory; or the Sick finding the Benefit, ſince it is diſhonourable to give a private Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine without Writing. But the manner of applying the Medicine to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Exigence of the Diſeaſe, he tells us, is the Doctors Secret; ſo not the Medicine it ſelf, or its artful Preparation: yet it is to be applied to ſomething <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> muſt we think it ſo to the Doctor, or is it that which is adapted to eſcape on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Eyes of the Apothecary? May not he poſſibly learn what Fevers will go off of themſelves, or to give them a Specifick that will only do no hurt? Cannot he diſguiſe a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Aqua ſimplex,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Bates</hi>'s <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropeg.</hi> to reckon the value of two or three Guineas for; and ſo ſave the charge of a Diſpenſatory coſtly malignant Compoſition? The Judgment of the Phyſician will never make either a bad Medicine valuable, or him ſo who has no good ones, any more than the tipping of the Inſtruments will render a Surgeon skilful, or the ſweetneſs of the Syrups and Conſerves recommend either the Dr. that preſcribes them, or the Apothecary that prepares them. But a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon that knows not whether his Inſtruments be good, cannot be thought very expert, any more than a Doctor that knows not the Medicines he preſcribes. The Doctors having but newly ſet up, and not made any great returns, would have us ſuppoſe common and cheap Medicines the beſt, that the leſs Stock may ſerve; rich active Medicines we cannot expect there, they ſo complain againſt them, they are but to cover the Fraud of the exacting Apothecaries. But that they may not loſe the ſmall Fiſh, the Poor are promiſed the moſt valued Simples, and the beſt Chymical and Galenical Preparations at a ſmall expence; which if they cannot pay, they muſt endeavour to get their Patrons to do for them: but whatever of the moſt valued Simples may be found in the Repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I will promiſe neither Poor nor Rich ſhall be able to purchaſe the beſt Chymical Preparations thence. He ſays further,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'To demonſtrate this, I will remove the Rubbiſh, and lay before you the Simples of the greateſt Virtue, and beſt Preparations, ſupported by the beſt Trials of Chymiſtry, and conſtant Experience. Gold, the great Idol of Mankind, muſt be rejected as uſeleſs, while it makes the World reſtleſs, and anxious to obtain it; it has in it ſelf no active Parts or energy to procure any Effect, it is not diſſolvable by any Humour in the Body; nothing there can alter it, or be altered by it: The compact heavy ſluggiſh Parts reſiſt the Impreſſion of every Animal Agent, which on the other ſide are ſecure from any Power it has. The golden Pill in the twiſting of the Bowels by its weight only, may open the paſſage, but it coſts you only for the Uſe of it. The leaſ Gold on Boles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> divert the Mind from the Taſt, only by the Pleaſure of ſeeing it; adds nothing to the Virtue, and only a trifle to the Expence: the Leaf may lie on the Mouths of the Veſſels undiſſolved, and it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0194501100:42"/>prevents the diſſolving of purging and alterative Pills if well gilded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to your good Fortune the Cover happens to be broken.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the Doctor would be plain, I ſuppoſe Gold is none of the Rubbiſh he would have removed from the Diſpenſary; tho he would not have it come too much into the Apothecaries Shop. But for the Credit of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, and its greateſt Maſters, I muſt tell him he is not ſupported by its beſt Trials: the greateſt Phyſicians and Chymiſts the World has had, affirm it capable of Preparation into very great Medicines; and even in Subſtance it has been ſuppoſed by no ſmall Men, to be of conſiderable Efficacy; witneſs the famed Cure of the King's Evil, where Gold muſt not be omitted or laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but the Diſeaſe returns. Doctors themſelves are very anxious to obtain this Rubbiſh, or they would never quarrel with the Apothecaries for getting it from them; and if it makes them ſo reſtleſs, it muſt needs have active Parts: <hi>quod agit agit</hi> is undoubtedly true. But methinks any Man that experiences the getting of Gold, may be ſenſible how refreſhing it is, and how it ſets all Wheels agoing. But to come a little nearer, if Gold were not diſſolvable in any of our Humours, it does not follow that it may not be a Medicine; What Humour will diſſolve burnt Hartshorn in the <hi>Decoct. album,</hi> Sulphur, ſome Gums, Woods, Stones, and other things commonly uſed by Doctors? But that Gold does not reſiſt the Impreſſion of every Animal Agent, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor might have known if he had been ſomething of a Chymiſt. That Body that the ſtrongeſt <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will not work upon, it eaſily tore to pieces by the addition of a little <hi>Sal-armoniack,</hi> and then by the addition of a little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> precipitated into a Pouder, perhaps the moſt active Body in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz. Aurum fulminans,</hi> which in ſome Caſes is not a contemptible Medicine; but when it ſhall be opened and volatilized, it will do what the Doctor never ſaw performed. Whether crude Gold does either good or hurt taken inwardly, is not very apparent; I believe the Doctor never ſaw the Guts twiſted (an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt would hardly think it poſſible) or was ſure they were untwiſted by the Golden Pill. If the Leaf may ſtop the Mouths of the Veſſels, which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is not certain of, the Animal would not be ſecure from its Power to obſtruct, which is ſometimes profitable, but the Doctor be ſure to contradict himſelf. If it would prevent the Diſſolution of the Pills, it might ſometimes be to the Patients good Fortune.</p>

               <q>'But <hi>Bezoar</hi> (ſays he) is rejected by moſt Phyſicians, who think on what they adviſe. It has the uſe of the Philoſophers Stone, procures Gold, or much Silver to every thing where it is a part: it adds to the Doſe only two Pence; but the very Name <hi>Bezoardick</hi> makes the cheapeſt Boles and Juleps paſs off at any Price.

            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Virtues of <hi>Bezoar</hi> have not been found ſo great as the Value, the Doctor is right here; it may ſerve as an Abſorbent, but other things eaſier to be purchaſed by young Shopkeepers will do. The ſame muſt be ſaid of Pearls, unleſs radically diſſolved: greater effects have not been found by them given in Subſtance, than may be procured by Oyſter Shells, or the like. But I am not of the Doctor's Opinion, that the Pearl Juleps take any of their Virtue from the Sugar, unleſs to pleaſe the Taſt, to which tho it be ſo grateful, it is not ſo to a Sick Stomach, and a Feveriſh Blood, being apt to ferment and trun ſour: Yet if any Gentleman or Lady is pleaſed to make uſe of either of theſe, it is to be had at the Shop at the College in <hi>Warwick-Lane,</hi> over againſt <hi>Froſt</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, and at the two gilded Spires in St. <hi>Martins Lane;</hi> the Doctor aſſures you cheap and good.

               <q>'Ambergreaſe and Musk are offenſive to many, from the Name as well as Scent, corrupt the Blood, and Spirits, and by altering the Breath make the uſe in Perfumes more neceſſary; the Confections and Waters are more wholeſom without them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> That Ambergreaſe and Musk corrupt the Blood and Spirits, the Doctor has never found by any certain Experiment, I believe; but that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the Spirits, moſt Authors agree with Doctor Experience. Some Perſons have a peculiar diſguſt at the moſt innocent thing; but otherwiſe grateful Scents are very welcome to Nature, and the ſmall Quantity that is given, they acting only by their Flavor or Odor, makes the uſe of them cheap enough. The Doctors need not fear the charge of keeping a little of them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'Our precious Stones coſt little (continues he) and are worth nothing. The Hyacinth, Smaragd. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> finely poudred, are as uſeful as Glaſs well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: the famous Confect of Hyacinth ſells two Pence the Doſe; Oil of Cinnamon, or other Chymical Oils given but to few Drops, are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed at the moſt inconſiderable Price in ſo ſmall a Quantity. Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> to be taken in Drops, or mixt up in Pills, theſe Drops will riſe to about a Farthing each. Cochineal promiſes to impart its Colour to the Blood, and diſmiſs the Paleneſs of the Checks; but we borrow it from the Dyers, at much leſs coſt than the former.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> It is true, the precious Stones the Doctors have ordered the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries to keep, and abuſed in Phyſick, are of very little worth, unleſs they are large; they ſhew the Igonrance of thoſe that have preſcribed them in their Receits, but ſome are to be commended for beginning to be wiſer. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Oils are of a great Value as to uſe, being the Eſſences of thoſe Herbs that yield them, but are commonly given in too ſmall a Quantity, or not us'd as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0194501100:44"/>they ought to produce the Effects they otherwiſe might. That Cochineal promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes its colour to the Blood, I never heard till now, or that any ſuppoſe it will tinge the Cheeks unleſs outwardly us'd: This notable Body is alſo given in too ſmall a Quantity to diſcover its Effects, tho the Price of it need not hinder its uſe. But the Doctor had rather be in the Fields.</p>
            <q>
               <p>'I divert you (ſays he) from the more pleaſant proſpect of the Gardens, Fields, Woods, Rivers, which plentifully afford us the moſt effectual and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Relief: their value in the Quantities us'd at one time are below any Coin, and the Cooking in ſmall proportions will not amount to much more.'</p>
               <p>'The Flowers, Fruits and Seeds, the Leaf, Root, Wood, and Bark are diſtil'd ſimply, or with Water, or Spirit of Wine; beaten with Sugar into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, boil'd into Syrups; compound the Pounders, Troches, and Pills; with Water or Wine, make the Decoctions, and Apozems. The Conſerves in the Doſe are a Farthing or two, the Syrups not much more; Pouders a Penny the Scruple, or half a Dram. The famous Gaſcoin Pouder without Bezoar; or 4 Pence the Doſe: Waters diſtil'd from Spirit of Wine therefore us'd in ſmall quantities, not dearer than a Glaſs of Wine. But the Ingredients better cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, or ſingly infus'd in a proper ſimple diſtil'd Water, would prove more Alexiterial, and deſerve the title of High Rich Cordial at a leſs Expence. When you have taſted the former Cordials in your Friends Chamber, have you not felt the Tumult in your Stomach of ſuch a Rabble of the Spices, which broil'd by the Fire diſturb you an your aſter, and make you pity his Condition under the often repeated Doſes? The Apozems Hepatick, Splenetick, Diuretick, or Sudorifick, are made at 2<hi>d.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> or 6<hi>d.</hi> the Quart in Spring Water, which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſent in little Glaſſes riſe beyond the Price of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> You may hence judg of our Oils, Ointments, and Plaſters; that the Surgeon reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Skill and Care, does not put you in mind of the Coſt he has been put to thro the whole Cure. You are well acquainted with the Prices of Drugs imported; as they are moſt of a hot Spicy Nature, their Doſe can be but ſmall, the Price proportionable. If many are abſurdly join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Quantity of each is ſo much the leſs. The Treacle of 60 Drugs does not claim a Penny the Doſe.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Vegetables diſtil'd ſimply are for the moſt part Simple, or no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; can ſerve only for Vehicles, but when kept a little are commonly corrupted, and ſome way ill taſted; ſome fair times of the Year is more wholeſom than moſt of their Preparations commonly in Uſe, if the ſick could but walk out and take it. The Diſtilling ſome of them with ſimple diſtil'd Water yields nothing but ſimple diſtil'd Water, and Spirit of Wine raiſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from others. A good Pharmaceutick muſt know the Nature of the thing,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0194501100:45"/>and adapt his Menſtrums, which the Learned have not well done in the <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory in many Receits: The huddling up a Farrago of different things with Honey, or Sugar, has not ſhown much of their skill, or the Reaſon of the Compoſition of their Pouders much appear'd. But our reform'd Doctor is of Opinion that the Ingredients inſus'd in a ſimple diſtill'd Water would be more Alexiterial, and be richer Cordials than diſtil'd from Spirit of Wine: but I think the Doctor canot be excus'd of Ignorance here, for Spirit of Wine is certainly a better Cordial than ſimple Water; every Porter knows the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence between the Cock and the Brandy-bottle. But thoſe things which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be diſtil'd with Spirit of Wine by thoſe that know what they do, are full of oily Parts which will not be extracted, and mixt with ſimple Water; and to give all things in ſubſtance would ſo clog the Stomach with the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of the Husks that hold the ſmall Proportion of Medicinal Juices, that no other Effect would be produced but the Oppreſſion of Nature. A rabble of Spices cannot be conjoyn'd by any that would have their ſingle Virtues to be ſeen; nor will they be broil'd in Spirit of Wine by one that knows how to work; and a ſmall Glaſs of a pure Cordial Spirit I'l engage ſhall remain more grateful to the Stomach of ſick or well, than half a Pint or a Pint of a muddy loathſom Infuſion or Decoction that will corrupt in a few days time. But I hope the Doctors of the Diſpenſary will not pretend to keep Oils, Ointments and Plaſters, theſe belong to the Surgeon, unleſs they will be ſo kind alſo as to let him have them at the intrinſick Value, that he may no more be cheated by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheracy.

               <q>'You may judg of the eaſy expence of what we adviſe by another view, the various Operations. The famous Vomitive is a Penny, Tartar Emetick not a Farthing, that of the Salt no more, Oximel the Value of the firſt; Pills for the Head, Stomach, Bowels, of different force, the price of a Penny; the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nephritick Antihyſterical Pills made of cheap Pouders, are valuable only for the Succeſs. I need not inform you how eaſily the fillings of Steel are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd. If you infuſe them with bitter Plants, or boil to a Syrup, you will readily eſtimate a Quart. All the Ecphractisk, or Deobſtruents, and Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Incraſſating, or Aſtringents, agree in their great uſe, and almoſt inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0194501100:46"/>cheapneſs. It muſt be own'd the Purges of Rhubard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be prized, but it is us'd but once a day, and not haſtily repeated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Doctor ſets up another inch of Candle, that you may have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view of the cheap pennyworths he has at his Shop: This famous Vomit is a Penny <hi>per</hi> Doſe, his head-Pills, ſtomach-Pills, bowel-Pills no more; cheaper than <hi>Tom Saffold's</hi> 18 for 18 pence, altho too cheap in any Man's own ſenſe: But the other that are valuable only for their ſucceſs (the true rule of valuing all Remedies) will often have no value at all. A few Doſes of Iron in a Quart of Water, you may have very cheap. Aperitives, and Aſtringents, the Keys of our Bodies, of ſuch great uſe, can hardly have any price. Rubard indeed, that ſo finely opens the Backdore, and ſhuts it after it, you muſt pay a little dearer for now and then; and if you meet with one of Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi>'s <hi>Medici ſtercorarii,</hi> he perhaps will preſcribe you nothing elſe. But he tells us farther,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'That out of theſe Drugs many kinds of Chymical Medicines are prepar'd at the Expence of only Fire, and the Uſe of the Glaſſes, in great quantities. If you pay for Spirit of Hartshorn, Sal-armon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tinct. of Caſtor, Amber-Saffron, the compound Elixirs, the Acid Spirits, or their Antagoniſts, the fixt Salts, the Vitriolate Tartar, or other digeſtives, one Shilling or two the ounce, you will with the Vehicle, after many days uſe, compute your daily expence of Phyſick. The Porter that drinks a cup of ſtronger Ale inſtead of many of the ſmaller, ſaves his time and his pocket, and is at a greater charge than the Patient.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If the Doctor had been us'd to Chymiſtry, he would have known that its preparations are not made at the mere expence of Fire, and uſe of Glaſſes, which were it ſo would not be a ſmall Expence; in many Preparations great Fires are us'd; and Glaſſes ſerve but once, ſometimes not once, but break, and loſe a thing of great value: beſides, there is ſometimes a large expence of time the moſt precious thing of all, and a great deal of labour. The very Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Chymical Spirits, Tinctures, fixt Salts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has aroſe much from the Sophiſtication. And tho the Doctor before diſliked ſpirituous and active Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, he now commends them by the Example of the prudent Porter who ſaves Time and Pocket, he might have ſaid Heart and Belly too, by drinking a little of the ſtronger Ale. Medicines of active parts are really the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, like keen Inſtruments, unleſs they happen in the hands of Fools or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that cut and ſlaſh they known not why. But ſays he,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'If in a Fever, the Small-pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Phyſician cools the Blood, and tempers the heat, ſhall the Apozem of almoſt the Saller Herbs, with cheap ſweetning Pouders, and cheaper Sal prunella, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Julep of ſimple Waters made to taſt a little of a Cordial water, raiſe the coſt higher than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0194501100:47"/>Sapports in Health? If the Blood and Spirits are oppreſt in the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſhall the Treacle, Mithridate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Aromaticks and Alexiterials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be eſteemed but from their effects of ſweating, and heating the Blood? If the Patient be not inceſſantly plied, and the Phyſician will have care when he has done enough for one day, and will give the Patient a little reſt, before he ſets him another Task: If the Fever truly intermits, has no Malignity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may uſe the Bark only prepared by poudering, which coſts no more than the Wine you drink it with. I have heard you extol the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Force of Opiates, from your Experience, in Cholick and Nephritick Pains. 'Tis true, that Plant has no equal among the Vegetables, nor does any Metal or Mineral pretend to rival it; but the richeſt Preparation of this great Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne raiſes no in quietude upon any other Circumſtance: The poor may have it as well as the richeſt, from a ſmall Charity, which will give the Donor the eaſe it procures to the Patients pain. It is not therefore demonſtrated, that in Sickneſs no Conſtitution can bear the uſe of more than two or three Shillings value in a Day? The deareſt Cordial Waters, and Alexiterial Pouders cannot in the time be uſed above that Price, without inflaming the Blood and Spirits into a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and forcing our common putrid Fevers into malignant. The milder Diaphoreticks, Diureticks and Alteratives don't pretend to be rated with the other; but in our common Fevers theſe aſſiſt Nature, the others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> In Fevers, and Small-pox, tho the Doctor ſeels his Sallets and other Coolers, or his ſweetning Pouders with his ſimple Juleps, very cheap; yet his cooling, and exhauſting the Blood, and thereby checking the Motion of Nature, in caſting off the Morbifick matter, often coſts the Patient dear, even his Life. If in Fevers more malignant, Treacle, Mithridate, and Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be eſteemed for their Virtues of ſweating, and heating the Blood; how can they be condemned ſo in milder Fevers? And why may not the cooling Apozems be uſed here, where there is more heat? But why may not Doctor err in cooling, and fixing too much, aſſoon as in heating and diſſolving too much? I ſhould think either Method may tire the Patient, or Nature it ſelf; but if thoſe things are given which ought to be given, <hi>viz.</hi> proper Medicines, it is natural to ſuppoſe they ought not to be any <hi>Gravamen,</hi> but a <hi>Levamen</hi> to Nature. The Bark is moſt of it faiſe, and every Doctor does not know the true, or beſt way to give it; and the falſe will coſt a Man dear ſometimes. <hi>Opium</hi> is a thing of great Force, but it has a Malignity in it, which none of our common Artiſts know how to ſeparate without ſpoiling it; if that were done, a Doſe might deſerve a Doctor's Fee: but I cannot yield to the Doctor, that it has not its equal among the Vegetables; there are many other Poiſons as effectual, and if skilfully prepared, of good uſe, tho none ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0194501100:48"/>much uſed; nor can I be perſuaded but that there are many Plants that have as eminent Virtues for their proper Ends, without ſo much Malignity, as <hi>Opium:</hi> Metals and Minerals, I muſt tell him, pretend to exceed it; the ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne Sulphur of <hi>Venus</hi> has its Virtue without its Poiſon, but the Doctor will laught at that as a <hi>Chymera.</hi> The ignorant will deny the being of that which is beyond their Skill. But I muſt tell him, we Chymiſts have known Reſt procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Preparation of Copper, when <hi>Opinium</hi> would not do it. The Doctor thinks he has demonſtrated, that no Patient can well take more than 2 or 3 Shillings a day in Phyſick; but if he had well demonſtrated, what they ought to expend in Fees for the intrinſick value of Advice, we might have had more Encouragement to come to their Shop: I wiſh he has ſhown how Cordial Alexiterial Medicines cure in malignant Fevers, and deſtroy in the commons and that the Mild aſſiſt Nature only in theſe, but not in the other. But to go on, ſays the Doctor,</p>
            <q>
               <p>'Where's then the Myſtery of raiſing the Bill to 1, 2, 3 or 4 Pounds each Day, by the Artifice of raiſing the Part equal to the whole, and ſending the Apozem, or Julep in little Parcels? The Electuary is ſold well at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> but the Boles come to each as much, tho it afford to Children 20 Boles. The contrivance of giving in a parcht Mouth, fur'd Throat, and nauſeating Stomach, an ill taſted Bole, when the languiſhing Patient can ſwallow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Liquids, has been reſerved for this Age. The Bole of fulſom Conſerve, or Treacle, is to be taken every 3d, 4th or 5th Hour, which diſpels all Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There's a little Julep ready to waſh it down: and this is of the greateſt Conſequence to the Apothecary; becauſe the Town has been uſed to pay 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> for each Bole, and not much leſs for the Draught to cleanſe the Mouth after it. This Advice was given to a Phyſician at his firſt entrance on the Stage, to order a Bole with a Draught every fourth Hour; which however it fare with the Patient, would recommend him to the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.'</p>
               <p>'The honeſt Phyſician mixes the Bole and Julep together, that the feeble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may drink his Cordial, to revive and compoſe him, without the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance of taking it at twice, and with Difficulty the other way.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> There's now no Myſtery of raiſing the Bill to ſo many Pounds, ſince the Doctor has diſcovered it; 'tis well when Men begin to have ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſcover one anothers unlawful Gains. The contrivance of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-taſted and fulſom, either Boles or any thing elſe, muddly horrid Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Infuſions at any time, is not proper for a nauſeating or well Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, a fur'd Throat, or parcht Mouth, and whatever they are mixt with, to delude the Stomach to admit them, it commonly ſuffers for it afterwards. I do not wonder at the Advice given to the Doctor, at his firſt entrance on the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0194501100:49"/>Stage; nor do I think the Mountebank, if he knew his Intereſt, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. But it is a ſtrange Character of an honeſt Phyſician, or Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Doctor, that he is one that mixes his Bole and Julep together, and won't let his Patient have the pleaſant reliſh of the Liq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or at laſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the horrid Taſt of the Bole: I hope he will order hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſome fine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thing or other, ſeeing he can afford things ſo cheap to waſh both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. In my Opinion it would be the part of a more honeſt, or at leaſt wiſer Phyſician, never to give any thing that will diſturb his Patient. But ſays the Doctor,</p>
            <p>
               <q>'I preſume you will allow the Corollary, that by much Phyſick divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little Parcels, and rated high, the Apothecary has in the Reward of his Attendance (which by the Phyſician is often excuſed) much greater Fees, often trebly or quadruply more than the Faculty. You will not be ſurpriſed, if it be aſſerted, that in a Bill of 10<hi>l.</hi> nine are the Rewards of his Advice, and Attendance. The People muſt accuſe their own Conduct, who never gratifying the Apothecary's Viſits, oblige him to bring in for every 3 or 4 Hours and ſeveral Days, as much as will anſwer one of the ends he propoſes to himſelf. Can he thus neglected by his Cuſtomers, with Safety to himſelf adviſe the Waters, Milk, Temperance, Repoſe, Exerciſe, a peculiar Diet, or the Country Air, by which obſtinate Diſeaſes are cured, to the reproach of the Compoſitions of the Shop? But what redreſs can be expected to theſe Grievances? There muſt be certain Rates ſet to all the Medicines, with the greateſt Encouragements to the Apothecaries to prepare them faithfully. They muſt bring their Number by the moſt proper Methods to be equal to the Occaſion the City has for uſing their Preparations. The former antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Methods muſt be revived, by which the People were eaſt without the preſent either Suſpicions, or Complaints. The Phyſicians lay under no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to impoſe on the Publick, they adviſed at their own Houſes in the Chronical, or leſs dangerous Diſorders, and diſtinguiſhed in their Viſits the Differences of the Condition of the Perſons, and Diſeaſes; and arrived to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, not by the baſeſt Arts, but their Care, and the Merit of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> The Burden of this long Song againſt the Apothecaries is ſtill, that they are too numerous for the Doctors, and get as much or more Money for their Medicines, than the Doctors can for Advice. But after all this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry againſt them for multiplying the Numbers of themſelves and Medicines, he confeſſes the Peoples Conduct is to be accuſed as the Cauſe as theſe Evils, by not gratifying the Apothecary with Fees for his Viſits; and ſo obliging him to bring in ſo many Medicines as will anſwer one End he propoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> a Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elyhood: If the People would be but ſo wiſe, as to give the Apothecary
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0194501100:50"/>his Fee for Advice or Attendance, and the College would be ſo good as not to perſecute him for taking it, he might afford his Wares as cheap as the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers in <hi>Warwick</hi> and St. <hi>Martins-Lanes,</hi> and might adviſe his Patients the moſt compendious and eaſy Method, and do for them as he would for himſelf, or own Family; he might keep a ſmaller and more ſelect Number of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and adviſe the Waters, Milk, Temperance, Repoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and live as well as the other Tradeſmen, and do the People more good, and leſs harm at leſs charge, than he does by every 3 or 4 Hours <hi>Repetaturs;</hi> and cure ſtubborn Diſeaſes, by hindering the Sick from taking the reproachful Phyſick either of the new or old Shops. But the Redreſs the Doctor propoſes of theſe Grievances, I think is ridiculous, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apothecaries to encourage them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Remedits faithfully, and give but few of them, muſt have their Medicins rates at a ſmall Price by the Doctors; which were it reaſonable, could not eaſily be done by thoſe Gentlemen, not yet well skilled in Drugs and Preparations. Yet this won't do alone, their Numbers muſt be reduced to equal the Occaſion the City has for their Preparations: How ſhall we know what Numbers will ſerve, or what Occaſions the City may have for their Preparations? ſome affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chymiſt would ſay, the City has no occaſion for any Galenical Stuff; and I to be free muſt ſay, for moſt of it. But what are the proper Methods to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, or which ought to be diſcarded, that the Remnant may live, by ſelling a few Medicines of ſmall Value? ſhall they be condemned to be hanged, and caſt Lots to ſave one in ten? Shall the greateſt Part be preſſed to fight the <hi>French,</hi> put in the Front and be ſlain by the Sword, or the Enemy, for being ſo unfortunate as to poſſeſs the fair Lady <hi>Pecunia,</hi> which the ruling Doctors are ſo paſſionately in love with? But after all I muſt tell him, I hate this wicked monopolizing Policy of men, that would get a good Trade into few Hands: This is not the way to have the People ſerved honeſtly, when they cannot go to him that will uſe them beſt; but the Commodities are ingroſſed, and ſold by a Combination. If the Apothecaries do increaſe more in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than other People, their own Increaſe will deſtroy them, the Trade will be good for nothing, and none will put their Sons to it; but their Apprentices ſerving 8, when other Trades do but 7 Years, would perſuade one they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not outgrow their Trade.</p>
            <p>What the antiquated Methods are the Doctor talks of, as deſirous to have revived, I don't know. But ſuch they muſt be, that the People will not eaſily ſuſpect or complain of the cheat, but be eaſy under it, while the Doctors eaſily get their Money. But if ſuch a Method were ever in uſe, or may be contrived, where the Phyſicians lie under no Temptation to impoſe on the Publick, that I ſhould be for; and ſuch wherein they might arrive to Reputation, not by baſe Arts, but by their Care, and the Merit of their Succeſs, that I ſhould
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0194501100:51"/>extremely like: But I think our honeſt Doctors and Merchants have not yet propoſed any ſuch Method, neither ſhall I now attempt it, but rather expect it in the honeſt Country-Phyſician's Anſwer to this long and tedious Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Country-Phyſician's Anſwer.</head>
            <p>SIR, that I may not wholly balk your Expectation, or neglect any thing wherein I may poſſibly do my Country any Service, I ſhall in as few Words as I can give you my Opinion of the Medicinal War you ſent me an account of, and the beſt Methods I can think of to bring it to an end; ſo that the Country which is the Seat of the War, may now and hereafter feel the leaſt of its ill effects. You know no one, that can be a capable Judg of theſe Matters, to be leſs intereſted than I; who have not practiſed theſe many Years with Apothecaries, or in any Confederacies; who have done nothing to oblige them, or diſoblige them, or had any Dependance upon them, or any others belonging to the Faculty, for Buſineſs, or Medicines to uſe in it, being by Profeſſion a clean Independent in Medicine, and ſo reſolve to ſtand on my own Legs, or fall.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you in the firſt Place, that I perceive the ground of the Quarrel here, is the very ſame as of that between the <hi>French</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>Self-intereſt,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt Party I believe will never yield to any thing, but for their own Advantage; and were I Plenipotentiary in the Affair, no Articles of Reconciliation ſhould ever be concluded between them, ſo as to unite them into a new Confederacy. There are too many of them combin'd ſtill, and the ſingle Parties at difference are either of them potent enough to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten too hard for the People. What the Doctor owns in his Concluſion would be very good, could it but be effected, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Phyſician lie under no Temptation to impoſe upon the People, and have no way to arrive to Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by his Care, and the Merit of his Succeſs. It would be a happy World, if Phyſicians, ſome of the moſt obnoxious Men in it to Temptations, were liable to none; the reſt of Men would doubtleſs be free. If they could not be tempted to impoſe on the Publick, and had no way to raiſe a Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by their Care and Succeſs; very few I think would be of any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But the ſtrengthening of Parties and Confederacies, to oppreſs others,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0194501100:52"/>or create Dependencies, is not the way to do this happy thing for their Souls, and the Peoples Bodies. But I will tell you in few Words, the beſt Policy to make them honeſt, and ſecure the People, is to break both the Armiss, that not a Man of them may act but in his ſingle Capacity; let there be none to command, none to obey, none acceſſary; but whoſoever is capable of the Buſineſs of a Phyſician, let him be Principal, and act in his concern independent upon any. But to leave allegorizing, and to repreſent the matter to you plainly; the true Method to raiſe the Reputation of Phyſicians, and to ſecure the People as much as may be from any damage they might ſuſtain by them, is this.</p>
            <p>That every Man that undertakes to act as a Phyſician, be skilled in all things pertaining to the Art, and that he himſelf perform, or at leaſt actually ſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, whatever belongs to the cure of Human Bodies; That there be no ſuch thing as Doctor, Surgeon, and Apothecary, as diſtinct and dependent Faculties; but that the one Thing, the Phyſician, be all of them, adviſing, preparing, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing his own Remedies, and doing whatever belongs to a Surgeon for his Patient, with his own Hands. Here every Man will ſtand and fall to himſelf, having no dependency on others, and himſelf reap the Fruit of his own doings whether good or evil.</p>
            <p>The one Grand Deſign of Phyſick is, <hi>the Recovery of the Patients;</hi> but there is a ſecond thing, which a Phyſician may honeſtly intend, <hi>his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Reputation,</hi> or if you will, <hi>honourable Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the attaining of theſe two Ends, as well as may be, it is moſt neceſſary that the Practitioner himſelf be ſo well accompliſhed, that he might act of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf independently, and ſo perform whatever belongs to his Profeſſion. That this is the only true Method of Phyſick, wherein its Ends may be beſt attained, may ſoon evidently appear, if we conſider a little. Whoſoever would deſerve the Name of a Phyſician, ought not only to be very well read in <hi>Phyſiology</hi> and <hi>Pathology,</hi> but to be vers'd in <hi>Experimental Philoſophy,</hi> the ground of all Phyſical Science: To have well ſtudied Nature in its intire and ſound State, and then to proceed to the Knowledg of its defects in order to remove them. But if a Man may be ſuppoſed to be never ſo well acquainted with the <hi>Phenomena</hi> and Nature of Diſeaſes; yet if he be ignorant of Medicine, the means to remove them, his other Knowledg is to little purpoſe: but he will be ignorant of the means to remove Diſeaſes, if he's not skilled in Pharmacy. If he does not underſtand the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> the Natures and Properties of thoſe Bodies that are to be uſed in healing, and the proper Methods and reaſons of adapting them to the uſe of the Sick, whatever he has of liberal Learning, is to little purpoſe: he muſt be a good <hi>Apothecary,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> or he can never bring thoſe Bodies he would uſe, effectually to perform their Ends in Nature. But if he could be ſupposd to underſtand theſe things in any tolerable Degree,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0194501100:53"/>without practiſing them, he may ſtill be at a loſs, the Remedies he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe may not be to be had, may be only pretended, or not duly prepar'd, whereby he may loſe the deſired Effect to his own diſcredit, and the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Patients. What Authors ſay of Remedies is not always true, and their goodneſs often depends on a Nicety of Preparation, which by miſchance, careleſneſs, or unskilfulneſs in Operation, often become good for nothing, and ſometimes not only ſo, but virulent and hurtful. To truſt to an Author for the Virtue of a Remedy we have never made, and don't underſtand the Nature of; to rely on an Apothecary or Chymiſt who has no other Deſign or Skill but to make, and ſell to the beſt Advantage, is not at all ſafe, and will not be done by a Man that duly values his Patients welfare, and his own reputation. The Prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Remedies with ones own hand is neceſſary, not only in order to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and faithful Preparation; but in the very Operation there is often more ſeen of the Reaſon and Nature of the thing, than can be found from all Authors put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and a great Part of Natural Philoſophy is manifeſt, and practically illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Analyſis, and Syntheſis of Bodies. In ſhort, a Phyſician ought to be ſo well vers'd in his buſineſs, that if there were no Books, nor no venders of Medicines, he would know which way to go to work to provide himſelf a ſufficient Apparatus for the curing of all Diſeaſes he deſigns to meddle with. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as External and Internal Diſeaſes are often complicated, and dependent one upon another; Fevers and other Diſtempers break out into Abceſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wounds, Bruiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produce Fevers, <hi>Deliria,</hi> and the like: it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Chirurgeons Hand ſhould grow upon the Phyſicians Arm, as that the Phyſicians Brain ſhould move and direct it. Will it not be a Diſgrace to a Phyſician, as well as a Damage to the Patient, that he muſt ſit ſtaring upon the diſtreſſed Object, while a Surgeon who is not always to be found, is ſent for in a Caſe where Phlebotomy is inſtantaneouſly requir'd? Is it not indeed diſhonourable, as well as diſadvantageous to him and his Patient, that he is but one Limb of a Healer, and muſt be beholden to another (perhaps wooden) Leg, calld in diſtinction a Surgeon, to perfect the Cure of a Bubo, Carbunkle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one who is ſuppos'd (if not wiſht) to be ignorant of the Internal Cauſes, Springs, and Effluxes of thoſe putrid Fountains? Or ſhall a Surgeon not bluſh to be ſo little a Phyſician, as that his Head cannot work as well as his Hand? muſt he needs call for one who perhaps has not ſtudied the Internal <hi>fomes</hi> of an Ulcer, to preſcribe him an internal Medicine, without which it cannot be healed? muſt he never let blood in the moſt needful Caſe, without the advice of one that cannot do it? or muſt the Patient be at the Charge of 3 diſtinct Operators, when one may, and ought to do all better, at the Charge of one of them? Beſides, this three legged Stool has often one Leg defective or ſhorter than another, by which defect the weak Patient often falls to the ground, when he might have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0194501100:54"/>held by one ſolid Baſis till he was able to riſe and walk. The Doctor, a Surgeon, if ignorant of one anothers buſineſs, will be very liable to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work one another; or if ever ſo well skill'd, they will divide the Care. The Surgeon will not ſo much value the Succeſs of what he does merely by the Doctors order, and the Doctor will not reckon himſelf to blame if the Surgeon does not perform his part well. So the Apothecary, to come again to the 3d Noun Adjective; which with the other 2 are now adays thought convenient and able to be equivalent to a Subſtantive the <hi>Healer,</hi> he will be ſatisfied either with Health, or Death, or long Sickneſs of the Patient, if he has but ſupply'd him with things according to the order of the Doctor: and he who is ſuppos'd to ſit at the helm of Life and Death, if the Veſſel miſcarry, will be apt to lay the blame upon the Errors, or Diſobedience of ſome one or other of the Mariners. But the little Ship of Man's Body being within the reach and guidance of one only Artiſt, he will have more care to perform what is requiſite to its ſafety, becauſe he only will have the Honour, the Reward, or the Blame of his good or ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I cannot forbear taking notice of another miſtake, ſomewhat akin to what we have been diſcourſing, and that is this: 'tis ſuppos'd that in the Multitude of Counſellors there is ſafety, when apply'd to Phyſicians. As for Apothecaries, and Surgeons, tho they be never ſo well skill'd, or chance to ſee farther into the caſe than the Doctor, or have a better Remedy than he knows, if they offer any thing, he will take it in diſdain, and no way admit what they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, of which I could give inſtances. But even in a Conſult of Doctors, there is indeed leſs ſafety: The diſgrace, or the credit will be divided amongſt them, whence the Care of the Sick will be the leſs. They will put the moſt Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to write, tho the greateſt Blockhead; none will much diſagree with the reſt: and if any one has a private Remedy more effectual, he will not adviſe that, or the reſt admit it without diſcovering what it is; they will eaſily agree not to diſgrace the Faculty by contradicting one another, who if they were ſeparate, they would be <hi>quot homines tot ſententiae;</hi> but one of the Doctors being more skilful than the reſt, if he were to act alone, would act freely, whenas ſhe moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being commonly the moſt modeſt, will be ſhy to be moſt forward, or to differ from the reſt, but will leave the preſcribing to the moſt Proud, and Confident, whom he will eaſily ſuffer to run away with the Credit or Blame of the ſucceſs, and content himſelf with his Fee. But if any one, with a more than ordinary Concern for the Patient diſlikes what the others adviſe, and offers a <hi>Noſtrum,</hi> or particular Method, they will be much diſguſted, and perhaps ſay, as in a Caſe I might name, it is a College-caſe, it muſt not be.</p>
            <p>But it would go better with the Sick, if inſtead of a Conſult of Doctors at the Patient's houſe, the one Phyſician he thinks fit to employ would conſult in his own behalf divers of his honeſt Brotherhood, and conſider their Opinions,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0194501100:55"/>and ſo act according as he ſhall then judg. But there are divers Objections I foreſee may be made againſt this Method of ſingle and independent Practice, which muſt be anſwered before I can well conclude the Subject; and they are of two ſorts, either ſuch as relate to the Method it ſelf, or to the Method in relation to, and under the preſent Circumſtances of Doctors, Chirurgeons, and Apothecaries.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it may be ſaid it is indecorous for a Phyſician to be concern'd with Manuals, diſhonourable for him, who muſt converſe with the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages: it is enough to make a Lady that is well, fall ſick, to have her Pulſe felt by a rough brown Hand. But I ſay, whatever may be the Niceneſs of a Beauiſh Doctor, or however a Lady that is wantonly ſick may like a finical Fellow, that is the moſt honourable and decorous Hand, that can bring the Sick moſt help.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Optima ſi profert Medicus Medicamina Morbis,</l>
               <l>Non pigeat prunis applicuiſſe Manus.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>A ſqueamiſh Doctor cannot more nauſeate any thing conducing to the Health of Men, than the handling ſome Chirurgical Caſes incident to all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but being the Members of his Fellow-Creatures, his helpful Hand can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abhor, with Honour or Honeſty, to do that for another, he would need, and think reaſonable in the like caſe to be done for himſelf; nor is it more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to ſhake the Urinal, <hi>vel Stercus Bacculo agitare;</hi> yea, or to turn over the Leaves of mouldy worm-eaten Authors, to inſpect the Relicts of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, than to open the Book of Nature it ſelf with ones own Hands, in Diſſections of Animals, and the <hi>Materia medica,</hi> tho there be ſomething both like Butchers and Colliers work, belonging to it. The Greateſt Men have done it; thoſe whom we are not aſhamed to follow as Maſters, but might with like Induſtry outgo, as far as they did thoſe that went before them. Nothing but the baſeſt Pride can diſdain to uſe thoſe Hands God has given us to the beſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, or think Mechanicks diſhonourable, which the greateſt Perſons (I may ſay Perſon) that ever appeared on the Stage of the World, diſdain'd not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. But</p>
            <p>A more material Objection, and indeed ſeeming Difficulty, is this, That it is a thing too great, a Task too heavy for one man to be well skill'd in, and to perform all things belonging to the Art of Healing. To which I reply, That as it is no way diſhonourable, but very much to a Man's Credit, to have both a Head and a Hand capable of doing whatever belongs to his Art; ſo it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and with diligence attainable. Any Boy of a Genius capable of doing any thing praiſe-worthy in Phyſick, if he be not abus'd, may by 16 have Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0194501100:56"/>enough to read any Latin Authors, and alſo have made a conſiderable Progreſs in the <hi>Greek,</hi> which by uſe, and the help of Tranſlations which are annex'd to moſt <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, he may in time compleat. As for other Languages, they are not ſo neceſſary, there being enough in theſe. And in learning of theſe Tongues, he may have read ſome Books of Phyſiology, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy. In 8 or 9 years more ſpent in diligent Reading, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of experimental Philoſophy and Pharmacy, with the ſight of Caſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by his Teachers, he may arrive to a capacity of doing creditably ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he has ſeen others do in all the parts of Healing, if he will but have the Modeſty and Honeſty not to undertake all Caſes rare and difficult, which many times puzzle Men of 50 years Practice. He may in that time be ſo far expert in all that belongs to the Cure of divers Diſeaſes, as that he may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and courageouſly undertake to cure 'em. But it will ſtill be objected by thoſe that would be thought worthy of a large Practice, That the Pharmaceutick and Chirurgick parts of Healing cannot be attended, by reaſon of the many Viſits the Importunity of the Sick obliges 'em to. But it may be anſwered, in many caſes Viſits are not neceſſary, the Patients may come home to the Doctors, and take the Medicines home with them; in ſome they need not be ſeen ſo oft: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, an ingenious Servant, a Pupil, will quickly come to take off a great deal of the Labour and Care in Preparation and Diſpenſation, and Conveyance of Medicines. There are ſome Preparations made by thoſe that have nothing to do in Medicine, as common Spirit of Wine, and divers others, in which there can be no conſiderable Deceit, which the Phyſician need not trouble himſelf to make. But above all, if Phyſicians would apply themſelves particularly to the Cure of ſome few Diſeaſes, ſome to theſe, ſome to others, they might be therein more expert, and eaſily provided with all things neceſſary for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Practice, without thoſe Defects and Damages to the Sick which ariſe from the common Diviſion of the Phyſicians work in every Diſeaſe, between two or three Perſons, each of whom is uſually unskill'd in ſome part of that which belongs to the Cure of any one Diſtemper. As if ſome would apply themſelves to the Cure of all ſorts of Fevers, others the Gout and Scorbute, others the Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and would undertake nothing but what they are well provided for, they might have more buſineſs perhaps, or at leaſt enough, and more Credit, and the Patients much more Comfort. But perhaps there may be ſome large Souls, that can neither be contented to ſubſerve a Clyſter, to ſpill the Balſam of Life by command, nor yet to be skilled in the cure of but ſome particular Diſeaſes; that think it little in a Phyſician, if he is not <hi>omnibus numeris completus,</hi> and cannot undertake all Diſeaſes. I ſay to theſe brave Souls, if they will but ſcorn to pretend, they may by Induſtry arrive to a capacity of honeſtly profeſſing themſelves Catholick Phyſicians, provided they will not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, nor undertake more Patients than they can well provide for, and by their Induſtry can be ſo happy as to acquire a few effectual and Catholick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0194501100:57"/>And I think they may get Money enough, tho they have no Under-workmen, and being greater Credit to their Profeſſion, and be a greater Bleſſing to the Age and Places they live in. I will profeſs, as to my ſelf, tho I refuſe no Caſes, except Lithotomy, and ſome few that require Accommodations in a Phyſician's Houſe, I deſire no more Patients than I can ſufficiently provide for with my own Hand and Eye, in whatſoever belongs to inward and outward Operations: And if any ſingular Caſe happens that I do not well ſee into, I can be content to conſult my Friends of the Faculty for my information, not to the Patient's Charge; or refer him to any of them that he or I, or any Friend can judg more expert in the Caſe: and what Money cannot be honeſtly and ingenuouſly got, I think is too much, and a Burden that will but help to ſink a Man into Miſery. And a mighty Practice, tho tolerably well performed for the real good of Mankind, is but a Life of mighty Care and Perplexity, not to be deſired by a wiſe man for his own ſake; but rather to be prevented by teaching the Rules of Health, communicating to other Phyſicians his Skill, and a modeſt refuſal of Caſes he does not yet thoroughly underſtand.</p>
            <p>But as to thoſe Objections that may ariſe againſt this Method of Practice, as relating to the preſent State of Phyſicians, Surgeons and Apothecaries in the City, and herewith to conſider more directly the ſtate of the Controverſy between the Doctors and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; it will be ſaid the Apothecaries are not ſo well skill'd in Phyſiology, Pathology, and the uſe of Medicines as they ſhould be, and ſo are uncapable of ſingle Practice. I anſwer, It is granted of a great part of them, and it is true of many of thoſe that call themſelves Doctors; but they of both ſorts might be capable of Practice, if they would deſire Skill as much as Money. It will be likewiſe ſaid, the Doctors are not skill'd in Pharmacy, Chymiſtry or Surgery. But it is to be anſwered, They may be, if Pride, Covetouſneſs and Lazineſs do not hinder 'em from doing their Duty. But it cannot be denied that ſome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries are as well skill'd in all theſe things, and ſo as fit to practiſe as ſome of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors their Antagoniſts, yea even of the Diſpenſary-men who ſwell ſo magiſterially. Had not ſome of them as mean Education as any? Were not ſome of them bred Apothecaries, or leſs to the purpoſe? Was not the very <hi>Acetabulum</hi> of the College bred to very little Language, hardly a clean <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, under a Country Apothecary, who, he himſelf ſays, was very little skill'd even in his own Profeſſion? Can a Licenſe be ſuppoſed to inſpire with Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in an inſtant? Or can another, bred a mere Scholar, uncapable of Divine Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Jacobitiſm, undetermin'd to Phyſick, of a ſudden become a Doctor by a Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Patent, and a compleat Artiſt in the Medicinal Faculty, with whom a Man of 1000<hi>l.</hi> a year may truſt his Life and precious Enjoyments? I muſt confeſs I never got any Skill on a ſudden by ſuch Inſpirations. I remember what <hi>Perſius</hi> ſays as to Poetry;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Nec fonte labra prolui Caballino,</l>

               <l>Memini ut repente, ſic Poeta prodirem.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>So ſay I as to Phyſick,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>I know not when, ſleeping in <hi>Phebus</hi> Beams,</l>
               <l>My heated Pate was fill'd with Phyſick Dreams;</l>
               <l>So that I waking found my ſelf a Man,</l>
               <l>Inſpir'd with Skill, a good Phyſician.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But the honeſt Part of the College, as they call themſelves, have ſet up Shops, where Medicines ſhall be well and honeſtly prepared, and thoſe Miſchiefs that have aroſe from truſting Apothecaries avoided; and ſo the Method propoſed, is to them needleſs. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it muſt here be confeſs'd, that they are ſo far commendable, as that they owning ſome of the Faults they have been guilty of, profeſs to do ſomething better. But what they do will not be enough; they are not yet well skilled in Pharmacy, eſpecially the chief Part of it, Pyrotechny; their Servants are not better skill'd than the Apothecaries, nor can they have that Care of the Succeſs of their Maſters Practice, as a Man would of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0194501100:58"/>his own: the Blame will not lie upon them, the Maſters don't always ſee what they do, nor can they always teach them what they ſhould do. Neither Maſters nor Servants have affur'd the People of more Skill or Honeſty than in the old way. But if any of them were real Artiſts, and had any great things, they would not communicate them; but if they uſed them, muſt ſo far act ſingly according to our Method. But the Force of the Objection againſt the Method I propoſe, lies in this; That conſidering the Doctors and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries are ſingly defective in not underſtanding the whole that belongs to the Art of Healing, they muſt practiſe ſome way or other dependently, or not at all; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d if the greateſt Part ſhould leave off Practice, 1. How ſhould they live? 2. How ſhall the People be ſupplied in their Neceſſities? I anſwer, many of them have got enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and may very well leave off, and take Care of ſecuring their own Health in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life by Repentance, or refuſe to undertake what they cannot do as they ſhould, till they can do their Duty. But thoſe that have not already laid up of the Mammon of Unrighteouſneſs, had better leave off quite, and take to ſomething they can more honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform, than abuſe their Neighbours, and ruin their own Souls. They can have no better Plea to continue in an evil Practice, than Bauds and Whores, who have not been bred to any other Employment. But as to the other Plea, how the People ſhall be ſerved; I anſwer, it is a queſtion, whether the preſent dependent Practice of Phyſick, taking one time with another, does more hurt or good; and to try the Experiment by leaving off Phyſick for 4 or 5 Years, till ſome ingenious Men were better accompliſhed, perhaps might be worth the People's while. But there are ſome that follow our Method, and have always done ſo, who might be more uſeful than ſome of them are, were the magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and haughty way of Practice by Preſcribing out of requeſt, and were the Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Patent no way able to perſecute or moleſt thoſe that are moſt capable of doing the Phyſician's Duty. But it will ſtill be replied, it will ſignify but little to perſuade Men againſt their Intereſt, the thing which all Men ſo vigorouſly proſecute. I anſwer, if what I have ſaid be not ſufficient to perſuade Phyſicians, that it is their Intereſt to be honeſt, and well accompliſhed in their Profeſſion, I would leave them, and addreſs my ſelf to the ſuffering People, eſpecially thoſe that govern, and propoſe to them two ways whereby Phyſicians might be excellently accompliſhed for their Buſineſs, and ſo more profitable to the People: for preſuppoſing the Perſons be ſufficiently accompliſhed in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and to have a Genius to Philoſophical and Medicinal Studies, or not to be admitted, they ſhould either ſerve, not ignorant Apothecaries or Doctors, but able independent Phyſicians as their Pupils, faithfully to be inſtructed a ſufficient Number of Years, on proper Conditions; as Medicine was taught of old. Or 2ly. That there ſhall be erected at <hi>London</hi> a School of Medicine, wherein ſhall always be a ſufficient Number of skilful Practitioners of all Parts of Medicine, who ſhould not only theoretically, but practically teach the Pupils all things that belong to the Profeſſion: and none ſhould be ſuffered to practiſe in <hi>England,</hi> but ſuch as being fit for Admiſſion had gone through all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Art, by continuance in this School ſo many Years, as ſhould be thought, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found ſufficient to qualify them. Which of theſe two Methods would be the beſt, I ſhall not now determine: either might be preferred in different reſpects. The laſt perhaps would be moſt liked, as ſeeming moſt honourable; the former might by an able Maſter be more eaſily accompliſhed, and both very well agree with what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> propoſes <hi>in Lege.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. He ſays nothing in it more to his purpoſe, than what he ſaid in his other Bills.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His deſign (apparent in them all) is to get Patients, Cuſtomers, and thereby Money. It cannot be ſuppos'd that 46 Leeches in our corrupt Times ſhould combine to carry on the Trade, merely for the Publick Good.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Means he ſtill uſes is no more than all Quacks uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to cry up themſelves, their Skill, and Honeſty, and the goodneſs and cheapneſs of their Remedies, their <hi>Noſtrums</hi> and <hi>Arcanas,</hi> and to tell of their great Practice, and at the ſame time to decry others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That to catch much Fiſh 'tis neceſſary to continue caſting the Net, one impreſſion of Bills will never bring in a Trade.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That he ſells his Bills (contrary to the charitable Cuſtom of other Quacks who give them <hi>gratis</hi>) the ſhorteſt of which at a penny a piece, may rob the People of above 4 <hi>l.</hi> more than the intrinſick Value.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That if the College be the ſtandard of what is creditable in Phyſicians, 'tis now no ſhame to put out Bills to get Patients.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That he has ſpent ſeven lines of his half Sheet in a Poſtſcript in anſwer to the Author of <hi>Bellum Medicinale;</hi> in which he accuſes him,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>of proſing an odd Method of bringing Phyſick and Surgery together.</hi> To which he replys;</p>
            <p>That the odneſs of the Method is no Argument againſt the goodneſs and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity thereof: but his Method was not only to bring Phyſick and Surgery toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to add Pharmacy alſo to them as a third thing, without which the Healer can't be his Crafts-maſter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He accuſes him, <hi>That he hath expos'd all the Doctors and Apothecaries.</hi> To which he replys;</p>
            <p>That his Accuſer hereby owns that they are capable of being expos'd, but he never deſign'd to expoſe, or thinks he has expos'd any of either Party but thoſe that deſerve it; and if any particular Perſon thinks himſelf touch'd, 'tis the Application makes the Aſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>For uſing Chymical Medicines only.</hi> But he replys;</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0194501100:61"/>
            <p>That he never profeſs'd to do ſo in his Book, or otherwiſe, but thinks him no very wiſe Man that ſhall ſpend Time, Labour, and Money on any Chymical Preparation, where a more eaſily preparable Medicine will do as well, whether Specifick, or other: But yet thinks it very well worth his while to work ſome even tedious, Chymical Preparations, knowing that there are Effects in healing to be wrought by Chymical Medicines, which no crude Simples, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds have ever been found ſufficient for. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He ſays he is no Chymiſt, not knowing that</hi> Aqua Regis <hi>diſſolves Gold only from the Spirit of Salt in the</hi> Sal Armoniack. But he excuſes him, That <hi>the Experiment may be too coſtly for him.</hi> To which he anſwers, If he that does not know that <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> diſſolves Gold only from the Spirit of Salt in the <hi>Sal Armon.</hi> is no Chymiſt, then Dr. <hi>P.</hi> is the Man by his own Argument will be proved to be no Chymiſt; for that which is not true, is not known to be ſo: but it is not true that <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> diſſolves Gold only from the Spirit of Salt in the <hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> for all that know the Nature and Uſes of Spirit of Salt, know it is no apt <hi>Menſtrum</hi> to diſſolve Gold, without the aſſociation of Spirit of Niter, which of it ſelf will not do it, but by both in conjunction it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily done; but the Spirit of Niter being the greateſt part of the Diſſolvent, has undoubtedly the greateſt ſhare in the action; ſo it can't be only from that Part which of it ſelf, or only is not ſufficient. Whatever will not do alone, can never be the <hi>only</hi> thing that does. But ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhould be told that tho there is materially, yet there is formally no Spirit of Salt in <hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> that Salt is not Spirit of Salt; and that he never ſaw a true Spirit of Salt in his Life: I don't know how he would be able to make out the contrary. But the Author of <hi>Bellum Medicinale,</hi> to prove againſt the Doctor the Action or Paſſion of an animal Subſtance with Gold, did not ſay, That common Salt is properly an Animal Subſtance (tho it is hardly ever wanting in Man's Body) or that the Volatile Salt in the <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> was the efficient of the Solution of Gold in <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> (whatever it may confer towards the effect) but added what the Doctor did not care to take notice of in his Poſtcript, <hi>viz.</hi> That Spirit of Urin (which certainly is an Animal Subſtance) precipitates the diſſolved Gold into <hi>Aurum F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lminans;</hi> in which Operation the Spirit of Urin has without all doubt ſome Action or Paſſion with Gold, the Calx of Gold made only with <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> having no fulminating Property.</p>
            <p>As for the coſtlineſs of the Experiment, <hi>Whether the Spirit of Salt only diſſolves Gold in Aqua Regis:</hi> If the Doctor ſuppoſes 8 or 900 Guineas muſt be ſpent, or that the Gold muſt be diſſolved by Pounds, it is confeſs'd the Experiment might be ſo coſtly; 'twere better being ignorant in the Matter, and skil'd only in ſome ſlight, whereby one might finger ſo much of the Metal. But the Doctor I muſt needs ſay talks here as if he were no Chymiſt, and could never ſpare his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0194501100:62"/>Gold to make the Trial, for Chymiſts know how to reduce their Gold again with very little loſs. But farther, I will engage to teach any Man how he may make <hi>ten</hi> Experiments of this Matter for <hi>five</hi> Pence charge, tho he ſhould not recover the Gold uſed in the tryal. But the</p>
            <p>Fifth and laſt thing laid to the Charge of the Author of <hi>Bellum Medicinale,</hi> is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in his Poſtſcript he makes the Dotor's Sum</hi> 870 l. <hi>too much, and probably</hi> 40 <hi>or</hi> 50 l.<hi>concluded the Apothecary's Bill.</hi> To which he anſwers; He will tell the Doctor a Story, and ſo leave him.</p>
            <p>There was a Gentleman on a time travelling on the Rode, and he fell among Thieves who rob'd him, as he teſtified before a Juſtice, of 1317 <hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> But whereas he was fooliſhly decoy'd into their hands, and very cowardly ſuffer'd himſelf to be rob'd by Perſons not ſo well arm'd as himſelf, he was aſham'd (like a Man cheated by an Alchymiſt, or a Whore) to proſecute the Felons; and ſo never ſtir'd in the matter, or ſought to apprehend them. But after ſome time it happen'd that they were diſcover'd by another Perſon (hating Villany) and accus'd of the Theft; but when they came to anſwer for themſelves, they pleaded that they were very Honeſt Men, and were abus'd by their Accuſer, for they took but 147 <hi>l.</hi> from the Gentleman. You ſilly Rogues, ſays the Judg, you have condemn'd your ſelves by acknowledging the Fact, and a Robbery great enough, there is now no need of farther Evidence, or of the Gentleman's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the larger Sum: Yet if he can be prevail'd with to appear againſt you, the Fact ſhall be made out in all its Circumſtances to your greater ſhame. But what you own you took is enough to make you Rogues that deſerve to be hanged with other Villains; God give you Repentance, and ſo Lord have Mercy upon you. But,</p>
