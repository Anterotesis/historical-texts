            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A General Hiſtory OF TRADE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Promiſed to Concern theſe Diſcourſes as little as poſſible with our Politicks, and with the Party Diſputes which are among us, and I'll keep my Word in it as well as it can be done; tho' I acknowledge it will be very Difficult to do ſo, when to the Nations great Diſquiet, we are juſt now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt going by the Bars about whether we ſhall Trade to <hi>France</hi> or No.</p>
            <p>It is Impoſſible to ſpeak of Trade in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and leave out entirely the Trade to <hi>France,</hi> and I fear it will be impoſſible, <hi>at leaſt to me,</hi> to ſay what may be neceſſary to be ſaid in order to ſet the Trade to <hi>France</hi> in a Clear View, without being Charg'd with Leaning to one Side or other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0488800800:3"/>Among the ſeveral Opinions about the Trade between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> I find none who have any true knowledge of the Trade in General, but what agree in this, That there ought to be ſome Trade opened with <hi>France</hi> ſeeing we have made Peace with them; Likewiſe all agree, That Trade, ſuch as it ſhall be, ought to be Settled and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Articles and Agreements between the Nations, which is the thing we call a Treaty of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Being thus agreed in the main Point, That ſome Trade muſt and ought to be Settled, and that a Treaty of Commerce ought to be made; the Queſtion remaining in Debate ſeems to be only, What degree of Trade with <hi>France</hi> ſhall be entred into, and under what Regulations, Reſtrictions, Duties and Prohibitions.</p>
            <p>Some are of the Opinion, That the Trade to <hi>France</hi> has always been a Loſing Trade, and that it will be ſo ſtill, and that as it lies at this time under Exceſſive Duties it will be prevented from being ſo, and that therefore all thoſe high Duties which are now lay'd upon the <hi>French</hi> Importations ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p>Others ſay, that as we have lay'd high Duties on the greateſt part of <hi>French</hi> Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations here, by which the Quantities Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will now be reduced: ſo the <hi>French</hi> have Loaded our Woollen Manufactures, and other Exportations thither with ſuch heavy Duties, or elſe with Total Prohibitions that effectually
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0488800800:4"/>
forecloſe the Trade ſo, That as you will Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port little from <hi>France,</hi> you will Export leſs to <hi>France,</hi> and the Ballance will run againſt you worſe in matters of Profit than it did before; theſe Men therefore are for taking off our high Duties on every Side, and leaving the Trade, as they ſay all Trade ought to be, Free and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened, except with ſuch moderate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions as may be no Grievance either to the Conſumer or the Importer.</p>
            <p>But a third ſort ſay, there is a Neceſſary Medium to be obſerv'd in this Caſe, and that ſeeing an Opportunity is put into our Hands upon the Occaſion of the Peace, to Settle this Trade to our Advantage, we ought to get all poſſible Burthens taken off from our Manufactures and other Exports from hence in <hi>France,</hi> and yet at the ſame time keep on ſuch part of our high Duties upon <hi>French</hi> Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported here, as may be ſufficient to reſtrain their Importation in too great quantities, ſo as to be prejudicial to our Trade in General, and cauſe an Over-ballance in the Trade to our Prejudice.</p>
            <p>The People who have had the Guiding this Great Affair ſay they have done this, and the oppoſite Party ſay they have not; one Side Challenges the other, THESE <hi>ſay,</hi> Trade is betray'd, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade ruin'd, the General Intereſt neglected, the Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> injur'd, and the <hi>French</hi> have too much Advantage; that they will Over-ballance us ſtill, and the Trade be yet to our loſs: On the other hand THOSE <hi>ſay,</hi> they have Secured the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commerce effectually
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0488800800:5"/>
to our Advantage, by Opening a Door to our Trade into <hi>France,</hi> having Obliged the <hi>Fr.</hi> King to take off all his Prohibitions and Additional Duties from our Importations <hi>there,</hi> back to the Tariff of 1664. and yet have ſhut the Door againſt the quantity of their Importations here, by leaving on great part of the Additional Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Trade was Loaded with during the War, ſo that the Prices of their Goods, particularly their Wines, Brandy, Silks, Linen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Principal part of their Importations here, will be ſo great, by reaſon of thoſe Duties remaining on by this Treaty, that the Conſumption will of Courſe be greatly ſhort of what it was uſually in thoſe times when, as the other alledge, their Importation ſo much Encreaſed and Overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd us. <hi>Again</hi> THESE <hi>ſay</hi> they have not left Duty enough on to leſſen the ſaid Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and that the Duties ought to have been ſtill Higher. THOSE <hi>ſay</hi> the Duties left are ſufficient; and that the Advantage is ſuch, and ſo great, as that they could not obtain any farther, nor indeed reaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon laying higher Duties on <hi>French</hi> Goods, unleſs they had at the ſame time Conſented that ſome part of the high Duties in <hi>France</hi> ſhould remain upon our Goods; which for the Encouragement of our Woollen Manufacture they thought it not proper to yield to, and they declare that they do think the high Duties which are to remain on <hi>French</hi> Goods here, are ſufficient to preſerve the Trade to the Advantage of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0488800800:6"/>If I can make any Judgment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſpute, it is, as near as can be, wholly Compriſed in this Abridgment: I ſhall not enter here into any part of the Queſtion, it being the buſineſs of a Hiſtory of Trade, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Relate than Decide the Diſpute. I am already Charg'd with being much farther Concern'd in the Difference than I really am; and I ſhall therefore avoid Diſputing any thing here, but Impartially ſtate the Queſtion, and lay down the ſtate of the ſeveral Duties and Prohibitions on both Sides, as they are now, while the Treaty is in Suſpenſe and not made Effectual; and as they are to be, if the ſaid Treaty is to take place; I ſhall afterward ſhew what the Difference is that will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the former Duties before the War, and thoſe, that if the Treaty take place, are to be the Settled Cuſtoms of the Trade; and then ſhall leave every Man, by the aſſiſtance of thoſe helps, to make a Judgment for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>In order to this, and for the information of thoſe who, tho' not Imediately Verſt in the Entries Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Inwards, or not ſo much Maſter of the Book of Rates as to know every thing without a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enquiry, are yet willing to know in Conciſe Terms, on what Foot the Trade now ſtands, and on what Foot it is to ſtand, that they may not, as moſt Men do, Diſpute without Book, and talk raſhly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Judgment without any Knowledge of the matter.</p>
            <p>I ſay, for the Information of ſuch as theſe, I have ſubjoyned proper Tables of the ſeveral Duties on <hi>French</hi> Goods, as they now are, and as they are to be if the Treaty of Comerce takes place.</p>

            <p>It is not the buſineſs of theſe Tracts, which according to their Title, are to be a Hiſtory of Trade, not a Diſpute about Trade; I ſay, it is not my buſineſs ſo much to Argue, as it is to Relate; and therefore I ſhall avoid the Diſpute: But altho' I do avoid Debating, it ſeems neceſſary to ſtate the Caſe upon which the Parties on either ſide are Debating ſo warmly, as it relates to the Levelling the Duties on the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Goods, to the ſame Rate which Goods of the like quality pay from other Countries.</p>
            <p>This Debate relates chiefly to the Trade of Wine from <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Sum of which Caſe is as follows:</p>
            <p>Before the war with <hi>France</hi> began, the Groſs of our Importations of Wines was from <hi>France</hi>; neither was there any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the quantities, as may appear by this brief Account,</p>

            <p>So that the Proportion, is about One to Fifty Eight; ſo much did the Importations of Wine from <hi>France,</hi> exceed the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wines from <hi>Portugal</hi>; as for the Wines from other Countries, they were not of the like kind, and therefore do not come into the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>All this while, altho' we had not ſo great an Export from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Portugal</hi> as we have had ſince, yet we had a very great and extended Trade; the reaſon of the Encreaſe ſhall be examin'd by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Wine Trade was not only little in quantity, but the Duties paid for it were greater than the Duties on <hi>French</hi> Wine for ſome years, by a very conſiderable Sum, as will appear by the Cuſtom-houſe.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0488800800:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>While the Trade of <hi>France</hi> ſtood at a ſtay, by reaſon of a ſtated Prohibition during the War, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> found the Demand for their Wines encreaſed to a degree, that at firſt their whole Kingdom could not ſupply; but as the proſpect of the War appeared like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue, and the Price the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave for the Wines was very encouraging, the Vineyards encreaſed every year to a very great degree, ſo that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Produce of Wine roſe from Five or Six Hundred Ton a year, to Seven or Eight Thouſand, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Import of the years ſince the War.</p>
            <p>Yet it muſt be allowed on one ſide too in abatement of quantity, that there have been ways and means made uſe of to Import great quantities of <hi>French</hi> Wines under the denomination of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Wines; alſo the <hi>Galitia</hi> Wines were, during the prohibition of Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> entred under the ſame Head; ſo that we are not to ſuppoſe all the Wines which are called <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Wines in the Cuſtom-houſe Books, to come really from <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened about the year 1703, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> being earneſtly ſollicited to break his Neutrality, and Joyn with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates in the late War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Confederates being willing almoſt upon any Terms to engage his <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Majeſty; the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> tho' willing to Engage, yet took that occaſion to make ſuch Conditions, as were particularly for the advantage of his Subjects in Matters of Trade, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0488800800:20"/>
with relation to their Wines: They knew well enough that the demand for their Wines in <hi>England,</hi> was occaſion'd only by the Prohibition aforeſaid, which by the accident of the War, was lay'd upon <hi>French</hi> Wines; They knew alſo, that when ever the War came to a Concluſion, and that by a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> the Trade for the <hi>French</hi> Wines ſhould be opened again in <hi>England,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tugal</hi> Wine would fall off again, and the <hi>French</hi> Wine would be the Common Draft of the Nation.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, they enter into a Treaty with Mr. <hi>Methuen</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, for the keeping the Duties upon <hi>French</hi> Wine up to a certain height in <hi>England</hi> after a Peace, and that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wine ſhould always pay a certain proportion leſs than the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Methuen</hi> ventur'd to agree to this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Condition was, That the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> ſhould take off all Prohibitions from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Clothes, and any other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures which were then Prohibited in <hi>Portugal</hi>; the Tenour of the ſaid Treaty, as it is Tranſlated in the Secretary's Offices here, is as follows: <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Her Sacred Royal Majeſty of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> may, in her own and the Name of her Succeſſors, be obliged at all times ſo to admit into <hi>Britain</hi> the Wines made of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Vineyards, that at no time what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether there be Peace or War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kingdoms of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0488800800:21"/>
any thing more may be demanded for the ſaid Wines, under the name of Duty or Cuſtoms, or any other Title whatever, directly or indirectly, than what the Third Part of the Duty or Cuſtoms being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, ſhall be demanded from an equal Quantity or Meaſure of <hi>French</hi> Wine, whither thoſe Wines ſhall be Imported into <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by Hogſheads, or Barrels, or any other Veſſels; but if this Abatement of Cuſtoms, as is preſumed to be made, ſhall be after any manner prejudiced or Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, it ſhall be Juſt and Lawful for his Sacred Royal Majeſty of <hi>Portugal,</hi> AGAIN to forbid the Woollen Cloaths, and the reſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Occaſion of the warm Diſputes among our Parties at this time, of which, without determining one way or other, or any way embarking theſe Tracts in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I ſhall give an Impartial Abſtract, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, as fairly as I can, the ſtate of the Queſtion, and what either Party alledge for themſelves in their Defence of, or Objections againſt this Treaty.</p>
            <p>The oppoſers of the Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France</hi> ſay, This is a fair, a juſt, and a reaſonable Treaty; That it is Sign'd, Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and Exchang'd with the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and ought to be kept Sacred. Whereas on the other hand, they ſay, the Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France,</hi> without any regard to the Stipulations of this Treaty, and taking
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0488800800:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no manner of notice of it, has effectually deſtroyed and overthrown it, by agreeing to Reduce the Duties on <hi>French</hi> Wines to an Equallity with the Wines of like quality from other Countries, which by conſequence includes the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines which are of like quality with the <hi>French,</hi> and that therefore the <hi>Portugal</hi> Treaty is thereby actually broken, the Faith and Honour of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation depreciated and forfeited, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it will be, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> will prohibit our Woollen Manufactures, nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our whole Trade: Nay, ſome go farther, and alledge, that the Peace with <hi>Pottugal</hi> is actually broken by this Infraction, and that our Trade to <hi>Portugal,</hi> which is ſo Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſo Advantageous, will be entirely loſt.</p>
            <p>I believe the Gentlemen cannot ſay, but that I have done juſtice to their Allegations, and given their Objections their full length, and I hope they will allow me to do the like on the other Side.</p>
            <p>The Advocates for the Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce alledge, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Trade to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> ſtands upon other Foundarions, that the Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France</hi> will have very little Influence upon it one way or other; That it is true, the Importation of Wine from <hi>Portugal</hi> will leſſen, tho' it is apparent that Importation will be greater many ways than ever it was before: But that our Exportation of Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to <hi>Portugal</hi> was ever very great, even
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0488800800:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before the War, when the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines made no figure at all in the Trade, and were not in all above 2 or 300 Ton in a Year; That the Encreaſe of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade in theſe late years, did not take its riſe from our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Wines, and conſequently will not feel any ſenſible decay or decreaſe, tho' we were never to take any more Wine of them.</p>
            <p>They farther alledge, That the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines will not be ſo greatly run down by the <hi>French</hi> Wine as was formerly, the humour of our Nation running all upon ſtrong Wines for theſe ſeveral years; ſo that it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that no <hi>French</hi> Wines are now in eſteem but the Rich high-priz'd Clarets, <hi>Puntacks,</hi> and ſuch like; That the price of their ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>French</hi> Wines is always high, and their quantity but ſmall; That the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wine will be bought at leaſt Ten or Twelve Pound <hi>per</hi> Ton Cheaper than thoſe Rich <hi>French</hi> Wines, and will be always wanted to make the Smaller <hi>French</hi> Wines Stronger, and the Pale <hi>French</hi> Wine Deeper, as was always the Caſe when the Trade was open, on occaſion of a bad Vintage in <hi>France</hi>; That altho' the Treaty with <hi>France</hi> does not preſerve the Inequality of the Duty between the <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Wine, ſo as to give the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the firſt, as was deſigned by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>; yet that the Inequality of the Price will always be an equivalent to it, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines being never bought at above 12<hi>l. per</hi> Ton, one with another; whereas
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0488800800:24"/>
theſe ſay, that the other Party have Printed, that the <hi>French</hi> Wine ſhall always Coſt 25<hi>l. per</hi> Ton in <hi>France</hi> after the Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus far they argue as to the Trade: As to the juſtice of Breaking the Treaty with <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> that is a Caſe by it ſelf; the People who are for the <hi>French</hi> Commerce, anſwer that part, by falling upon the Treaty it ſelf, and upon the People that made it; They ſay, it is a Treaty Inconſiſtent with the Conſtitution of <hi>Britain</hi> in its nature, and therefore is not to be kept, but is void of Courſe, and by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of things; That he who made it, had he not been gone to anſwer it in another World, ought to have anſwer'd for it at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, and ought to have been Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>They alledge that this Treaty Limits the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Crown, ſtipulating, That the Parliament ſhall not lay on any higher Duties than ſuch and ſuch mentioned in that Article, Pretending that a private Tranſaction of a Miniſter or Ambaſſador ſhall be binding, and and Conſequently Superiour to the Parliament; and that it is in the Power of an Ambaſſador to tell the Parliament what Taxes they ſhall not Lay, and by the ſame Rule may tell them what they ſhall Lay, which is a Power deſtructive to the Being and Nature of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and cannot be done; That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament has alone the Power to Determin what Duties ſhall, or ſhall not, be Lay'd upon the Exportations and Importations of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0488800800:25"/>
as well as upon any other things, and no Invaſion, that ſhall be made, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be made, upon that Power, can be binding to the People of <hi>England</hi>; that on this Account, it cannot be any Injuſtice, or any Illegal Act for the Parliament to confirm any other Treaty, which ſhall Contravene or Reſcind that Treaty.</p>
            <p>Again, they add, That the Treaty carries, in the Body of it, an expreſs Suppoſition, That the Parliament may ſee Reaſon to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travene, Break, or Reſcind it, and therefore makes Proviſion for ſuch an Incident in a Clauſe, which determins what it ſhall be Lawful for the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to do, if the ſaid Treaty ſhould be broken.</p>
            <p>This they alledge alſo, amounts to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Stipulation, That the Breach of this Traty, ſhall not be eſteem'd a Breach of the Peace between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>; for that when it ſays particularly, what it ſhall be Lawful for the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to do upon ſuch a Breach, it ſtrongly implies, That it ſhall not be Lawful for him to take any other meaſures in that Caſe, or carry his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment any farther than to the Prohibition of ſuch and ſuch Goods, as were Prohibited before.</p>
            <p>Another Debate ariſes alſo from this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Infraction of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Treaty, by the new Treaty of Commerce with <hi>France,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) That one Party alledges, That it is expreſly ſaid, in caſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their part, it ſhall be Lawful for the King

            <p>The Advocates for the Treaty Object, That tho' it is true, that the Words of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do expreſs it, in that manner, <hi>caeteriſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Lanificia</hi>; yet that the Word <hi>Rurſus</hi> Again, explains the meaning of it, That it ſhall be Lawful for the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Again to Prohibit, can ſignify nothing of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures, but what was Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited before.</p>
            <p>Then it remains to examine, what <hi>Britiſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures were Prohibited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. One ſide affirms, that no more were formerly Prohibited, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Cloths, and challenges the other to name, what other Woollen Manufactures were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, which indeed they have not done, contenting themſelves to affirm, that there were other Woollen Manufactures Prohibited in <hi>Portugal,</hi> without ſaying what they were.</p>
            <p>The Truth of this Caſe, is indeed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different, from what either Party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. There were indeed ſeveral Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> call them, Publiſhed, as I take it, in the Years 1688, 1692, and 1697, and in other Years, which were made to prevent the People of <hi>Portugal</hi> running into the new Faſhions, and change of Habits, according to the Cuſtoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi>; in order to which, I ſay thoſe Pragmaticks were made to forbid, not the Importing only, but wearing any of the medly or mixt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0488800800:27"/>
Cloths of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or any other Country.</p>

On the other hand, it is certain, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> did never refuſe to admit the Importation of any of our Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures into <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon any pretence whatſoever, except the ſaid Medly Cloths; and this, I think, without being partial to either ſide, I may take for an Aſſurance, that they were not Prohibited.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the Nature of the Trade between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> is ſuch, that altho' this Breach of the Clauſe ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, yet it does not ſeem, that the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> would at all admit them to prohibit Commerce with <hi>England,</hi> or to Prohibit the Woollen Manufactures in general, as ſome People ſuggeſt, and that on ſeveral Accounts; I ſhall name but three, as I ſaid before, becauſe I ſhall not make theſe Tracts, which are deſign'd to be Hiſtorical chiefly, meddle at all with the Controverſy on either ſide.<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe tho' we may not take off ſo great a quantity of their Wines as we did before, yet that we ſhould ſtill take off a very great quantity, and which it would be very well worth their while to diſpoſe of.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0488800800:28"/>2. That <hi>England</hi> is the only Market they have in the World, not for their Wines on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for the other capital Produce of their Country, ſuch as Oil and Fruit, which if they ſhould Prohibit a Trade with us, they could by no means find a vent for in any other Nation; the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking off but very few of them, and the <hi>French</hi> none at all.</item>
                  <item>3. That they are not able to carry on their Trade to <hi>Braſils,</hi> which is now encreaſed to ſuch a prodigious Degree, as from Eighteen or Twenty Two Sail of Ships to a Hundred and Forty Sail, neither without our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, or without the ſtocks of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who ſell the greateſt part of their Goods, to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Merchants, to be paid at the return of the Fleet from the <hi>Braſils.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I think however warm they are on both Sides in that part of the Quarrel, they Err in this, That they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade to be much more at the Mercy of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> than it really is; or than conſiſts with the Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade to have it be.</p>
            <p>If our Manufactures were not neceſſary to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> they could not be induced to take off ſuch a very great quantity yearly as they do, by the Argument of our taking off their Wines; for the utmoſt value of the Wines being not above Seventy or Eighty Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and the Export of our Woollen Manufactures amounting, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0488800800:29"/>
ſome ſay, to Eight Hundred Thouſand, and as others, to a Million of Pounds Sterling a year to <hi>Portugal,</hi> they would never make the taking off of Eight Hundred Thouſand Pounds in Wines, which is our part, be the Cauſe of their taking off a Million from us, which is their part, and pay the Nine Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twenty Thouſand Pound in Specie to procure it; this, I ſay, does not ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
            <p>But the true ſtate of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade ſtands thus: Upon the late Treaty with <hi>Portugal,</hi> their King perceiving that by our prohibiting the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Wine, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for his Country Wines was mightily encreaſed, and that the Profit to his Subjects was exceeding Great, by Planting more Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and Encreaſing the Vallue of the Lands, and by Conſequence of his Revenue; and likewiſe foreſeeing, that when-ever the <hi>French</hi> Trade ſhould be opened again, that Demand for <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines would fall again, Contriv'd to bring the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into a Treaty of Inequallity of Cuſtom, in favour of his Wines againſt the <hi>French, one third part,</hi> as by the Article quoted already appears; the Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for this Favour was the taking off the Prohibition upon our Woollen Mixt Cloth, as aforeſaid; but it does by no means ſtand with the Circumſtances of the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>'s Subjects, or the Nature of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that if this Article cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, he ſhould ſtop a Commerce, by which all the reſt of the Produce of his Country
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0488800800:30"/>
ſhould be carried off and conſum'd; this would ruin the whole Commerce of his Kingdom, and be ten fold more Diſadvantage to him one way, than it would be Advantage to him another.</p>
            <p>Again, the quantity of <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines Imported hither, take them one year with another, have been about Seven Thouſand Ton a year; this cannot be entirely ſunk, and I believe, if all was to happen that can happen by the Treaty, there cannot be leſs Imported into <hi>England,</hi> than one half of that quantity, the People being, as was noted above, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd ſo much to ſtrong Wines, that the <hi>French</hi> Trade cannot fully Anſwer their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and all the ſmall thin Wines of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the Banks of <hi>Loir,</hi> will now, probably, be little worth; ſo that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines cannot be ſuppoſed to ſink above one half; or ſuppoſe it may be about Four Thouſand Ton, which is Forty Thouſand Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> at Ten Pound <hi>per</hi> Ton, which Ten Pound <hi>per</hi> Ton in time of Peace, and open Trade, will be the top of the Market. Now it does not ſeem rational to me, I ſay, <hi>to Me, for I ſpeak my private Opinion,</hi> That the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould quarrel with <hi>England,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit our Trade, put a ſtop to a current Demand of a Million <hi>per Annum</hi> Import, which pays him a very great Revenue, put a ſtop to the Conſumption of all the other Growth of his Country which we take off, ſuch as Oil, Shumack, Figs, Salt, Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Salt excepted, no Nation but the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0488800800:31"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> can take thoſe Goods off, and all this for want of our taking Forty Thouſand Pounds worth of Wine.</p>
            <p>Add to this, That by this Method he would hinder the <hi>Engliſh</hi> taking off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining quantity of Wines alſo, which would be very conſiderable, and by the Calculation above, amounts to Forty Thouſand Pounds more; and ſo thro' us, quite out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of <hi>Port</hi> Wine, which, as it is now, the Draft will not eaſily be altered, and the Advantage of the Conſumption is ſo much the Intereſt of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> to preſerve, that no one can ſuppoſe they would be ſo weak, as to throw it away, without ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ground.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons, I cannot ſee room to think, That ſuppoſe the worſt, nay, ſuppoſing all the Conſequences which People fear as to the <hi>French</hi> Trade interfering with the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>; yet it not does ſeem reaſonable to think, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> will Prohibit any part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, much leſs the whole <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Trade, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
            <p>In this poſture, the State of the Diſpute ſeems to ſtand, and as every one is left to determine in favour of thoſe who they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove moſt; ſo I ſhall not engage againſt one Side or other, but Modeſtly and Calmly give my Thoughts upon the whole.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſh'd, that Party and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were left out of theſe Debates. Our Trade is an Eſſential Article, upon which the Felicity of the Nation very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0488800800:32"/>
and which muſt many ways receive an injury by theſe Obſtructions; nay, the very Debating theſe things, awakens the Enemies of our Commerce, and lets them into ſome parts of the Diſpute, which they ſhould rather be Ignorant of than know: <hi>For Example,</hi> 
               <list>
                  <item>1. While one Paper makes a very great ſtir, and lays a vaſt Weight upon the <hi>French</hi> falling upon our Manufactures, publiſhes how eaſie it is for them to get away all our Trade, how they Work Cheaper, and perform their Work as well as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they are able, not only to ſupply themſelves, but all the reſt of the World, nay, that they could come in upon us, and Under-ſell us at our own Doors; while they do thus, I ſay, they do an irreparable Injury to their own Country.</item>
                  <item>2. On the other hand, While the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Paper publiſhes, the great Advantages of our Nation in the Treaty, over the <hi>French,</hi> and how it is in our hands, to make the <hi>French</hi> Trade be to the Gain of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſo many Thouſand Pounds a Year. This is alarming the <hi>French,</hi> and telling them we have made Fools of them in the Treaty, by which we ſet them to Work to retrieve it by all poſſible Methods; and perhaps, at laſt, to find ſome ſhift to get out of the Nooſe, and turn the Advantage againſt us; things they are very dexterous in doing.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0488800800:33"/>To deſcend a little farther in theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and Diſcourſe them Impartially, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reflecting either on one Party or another, It is my Judgment, that the Extremes on both theſe Sides, are very deſtructive at this time to the General Intereſt of Trade in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no queſtion to be made, but the preſerving the Woollen Manufacture in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to be, as it ever was ſince we were firſt Maſters of it, OUR OWN, Excluſive of all other Nations in the World, is our great Concern, our true Intereſt, and is what the Wealth and Proſperity of this Nation really depends upon.</p>
            <p>There is no queſtion to be made, but every Nation round us, who are capable to make any Progreſs in ſuch an Attempt, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as much as in them lies, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate us, in a thing ſo prodigiouſly Gainful: The <hi>Dutch</hi> do it, the <hi>Flemmings</hi> have always done it, and the <hi>French</hi> have been now above Seventy Year, making gradual ſteps in it.</p>
            <p>What indefatigable, reſtleſs Induſtry, what Severe Application, what all poſſible Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from their Government, what their own neceſſity, which is the Spring of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is able to do: This is not wanting, nor has been wanting in <hi>France,</hi> during the long Reign of the moſt Politick and Potent Prince <hi>France</hi> ever knew, and they do all a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Circumſtances can do, to come to a Perfection in the Woollen Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0488800800:34"/>But they Labour under inſuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſtruggle with invincible Obſtacles, which ſmother the Flame of their Induſtry, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the want of Wooll; this is the main Caſe, and as Nature has it not, the Soil, the Clime does not produce it, they, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, cannot have it, but by the ſupply from us; nor are they wanting in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to get the Wooll from us, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> they Rummage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creek, and every Corner, run all Riſques, Buy, Bribe, Fetch and Carry, do all that deſperate Dilligence can do to get our Wooll, and too much Succeſs they have in their endeavour.</p>
            <p>But when all is done that can be done, the Wooll they get cannot be a quantity ſuitable to the Demand, or ſufficient to carry on a National Manufacture; and alſo it muſt be dearer by much than our Manufacturers have it at Home; the Expence, the Hazard, the Hands employ'd, the Freights, the Loſſes, all go into the Price of that which arives, and is made uſe of; then the Carriage when Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for Conveying it to Remote Places; this all adds to the Price, and is a damp upon the Manufactures, which it is not poſſible to avoid, and which muſt neceſſarily give the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our People, who have the Wooll at their own Doors.</p>
            <p>I cannot doubt, but our Government, may in time find out ſome better Method, than is yet put in practice, for the reſtraining this Export of Wooll, and for the putting a check
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0488800800:35"/>
upon the <hi>French</hi> Manufactures the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way; for nothing is more evedent, than that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll were effectually kept at Home, the <hi>French</hi> could never go on with their Manufacturing to any conſiderable degree, and the Government cannot but think it for the publick Service to have all poſſible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It is not the Buſineſs of this Tract, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what are the eſpecial Grievances of this Article, and why a Nation, to whoſe Intereſt it is ſo eſſential to prevent the Exportation of their Wooll, ſhould at the ſame time have the Laws for that purpoſe ſo ill Executed, as that in almoſt every part of the Kingdom the Wooll is carried Abroad, not with allowance, <hi>we cannot ſay that,</hi> but with an open Violence, and even ſometimes by Force and Blood, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Murthers, Fightings, and Breakings of the Peace, having hapned upon this Occaſion in many Parts: As if the <hi>French</hi> were come to that paſs, either of Inſolence in Dealing with us, or neceſſity of their own Side, that they were reſolved to fetch away our Wooll by Force; to this end they make little Deſcents and Invaſions upon us, ſuch I may rightly call them, for the carrying off our Wooll, Arm'd either with Money to draw, or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to drive thoſe, who, in Diſcharge of their Duty and Office, appear to oppoſe them. This is ſo well known, that I need not enter into Particulars, or enquire, where, when, and in what manner it is done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0488800800:36"/>It is ſufficient to ſay by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, That the Exportation of Wooll from Her Majeſty's Dominions is now ſo great, that unleſs ſome ſpeedy method be taken to redreſs this Grievance, and to put a ſtop to it, we may ſoon ſhake hands with our Foreign Trade, and ſee our Neighbours rivalling our Manufactures in a manner, which otherwiſe they could not hope to do.</p>
            <p>There are four Vents by which our Wooll is now Unhappily carried out of the Country, (<hi>viz.</hi>) 1. <hi>Rumney-Marſh,</hi> &amp;c. on the Coaſt of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which has been the Place made famous for many Years for that Wicked Trade, and where it was carried on, even during all the late War, with a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, like that of a Neutrality, as if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> had made a Ceſſation, or were two Neutral Nations, not concern'd in the War on either ſide; and as in the time of War, that corrupt Commerce was carried on, tho' not to ſo great a Degree as formerly, ſo much more now the Peace is made, is it renewed to a Degree equal to whatever it was before the War.</p>
            <p>Next to this, is the Coaſt of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as in the other parts, the <hi>French,</hi> practice the ſame thing, and have done ſo for a long time, tho' never with ſo Open and Bare-fac'd a Confederacy as they do now, and where the <hi>French</hi> Boats have found the way to ſhare with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as a Coaſt, altho' farther off from their own, yet where they are not in Danger of the Cruiſers and Cuſtom-Houſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0488800800:37"/>
Veſſels, who are employ'd on the Coaſt of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> on purpoſe to ſeize them at Sea.</p>
            <p>But here, as ſoon as the ſaid Wooll is on Board, they are Safe, and bending their Courſe directly over for <hi>Holland,</hi> they keep along that Shore to <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as they ſee Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I may in time, enter upon a more particular Enquiry into this part of that Corrupt Trade, and how it is managed on Shore, to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching a few private Men, but to the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing the Nation; and which, if it be not prevented, will, in a few Years, make a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alteration in the Face of our Trade.</p>
            <p>The next Outlet for our Wooll has been in <hi>Scotland</hi>: Before the Union of the two Kingdoms, the Exportation of their Wooll was free and allowed by their Law; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, their own Wooll was not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in <hi>France,</hi> as being too Coarſe for their Manufactures; yet they found a great Market for it in ſeveral parts of <hi>France,</hi> for their meaner ſort of Goods. But this was not all, as the Border of <hi>Scotland,</hi> adjoyning to <hi>England,</hi> was extended a great way from <hi>Berwick</hi> to <hi>Caliſle,</hi> for above Sixty Miles, it was not poſſible to keep the Paſſages ſo well guarded, but that great quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll were frequently, and almoſt daily, carried in Horſe Packs, by private ways into <hi>Scotland:</hi> In this Work they were generally ſo well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that altho' it was often diſcovered, by the Officers, yet they could not, without
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0488800800:38"/>
more aſſiſtance ſeize upon it; and before ſuch aſſiſtance could be procur'd, the Drivers of the Wooll, would get their Horſes over the Border, when the Officers, altho' they ſtood in view, had no more Power to act; ſo that by this means the quantity of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll Exported into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence into <hi>France,</hi> was very great, nor was there any way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
            <p>After the Union, the ſame Laws of Trade taking place in both Countries, the Wooll could no more be Exported from <hi>Scotland</hi> but by Stealth: But the Laws of that kind being very difficult to be Executed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Reaſon of the innumerable Number of Creeks and Coves along that Coaſt, the ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Officers, their remote Stations from one another, their ſmall Salaries, little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and the eaſyneſs of carrying the Wooll unſuſpected to the Sea Coaſt; the Exportation of Wooll, is now carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in that Country to an extravagant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and it is not eaſy to prevent the ſame.</p>
            <p>The laſt Article of this kind is <hi>Ireland,</hi> and here indeed, Wooll, ſeems to be one of the Principle Commodities of the Country. They Export it to <hi>France,</hi> not as if it was Prohibited, but rather as if it was the allowed Traffick of the Place: Whole Ships are Freighted with it, they are known when at Sea, by their being ſo light in their Loading; and our Sailors ſay to one another as they paſs them at Sea, <hi>There goes an</hi> Iriſh <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0488800800:39"/>This is farther Demonſtrable, from the ſtrange Change that is made in the Face of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Trade, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That whereas they crowded in their Wooll ſo faſt upon us in <hi>England,</hi> that our People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Glut of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll, and that it ſunk the Price of our own Wooll, which for want of a Trade, lay much on our Hand; now for theſe two Years paſt, the caſe is quite changed, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll is not to be had for Money.</p>
            <p>What can be the Reaſon of this? We know the quantity is not Diminſhed, nor is the Trade Encreaſed, that <hi>Ireland</hi> can Manufacture it at Home, and ſo cannot ſpare it for Exportation, that would be good news for <hi>Ireland</hi>; but the Truth of the Caſe is what I am upon above, <hi>viz.</hi> That the quantity goes off another way, the Channel is turn'd, they have a Secret Vent to <hi>France,</hi> and there goes away the Wooll.</p>
            <p>No Man need ſeek any farther for a Reaſon why, or an Account how, the <hi>French</hi> came to be Arrived at ſo great a Perfection in our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and to make ſuch great quantities as it is ſaid they do; here is the true Reaſon, and till this be prevented, it will never be otherwiſe; whereas, if the ſtream of Wooll were ſtopt from <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which are the Fountains, the <hi>French</hi> would never be in any Condition to do us any conſiderable Damage of that kind; for they really have not the Materials, they have not Wooll, neither can any part of the World ſupply them.</p>
            <p>The next Tract of this Kind, ſhall enquire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this part of Trade, and make ſome Eſſay at a Method to prevent, at leaſt leſſen, the Exportation of our Wooll, ſo as that the <hi>French</hi> ſhall not be able to break in upon our Trade; and then if the new Treaty of Commerce does really, as its Defenders alledge, open the Door of Trade, by taking off the Impoſitions upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures in <hi>France,</hi> it may be a means to recover our Trade in <hi>France,</hi> and render all the Attempts of Manufacturing in <hi>France,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bortive and Ineffectual.</p>
