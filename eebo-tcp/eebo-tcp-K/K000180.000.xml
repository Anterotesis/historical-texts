            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>I COMMIT this Comedy to the preſs with all poſſible
gratitude to the Public for the reception it has met: I cannot flatter myſelf
that the ſame applauſe will follow it to the cloſet; for as it owed much
to an excellent repreſentation, I have neither on this, nor any preceding
occaſion, conſidered myſelf other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as a ſharer only with the
Managers and Performers, who have diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the
exhibition of my trifling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. But it is not on the ſcore of
ſpectacle only that I am obliged to Mr. Garrick; I am both in the inſtance
of this Comedy, and in that of the Weſt Indian, materially indebted to his
judgment, and owe the good effect of many incidents in both to his
ſuggeſtion and advice: the correction of a real critic is as different from
that of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, as the operation of a ſurgeon from the ſtab of an
aſſaſſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0110602200:5"/>The Comedy, now ſubmitted to the reader, is
deſign'd as an attempt upon his heart, and as ſuch proceeds with little
deviation from mine; if it ſhould be thought therefore, that I have meant
well, the charge of having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted indifferently I ſhall patiently ſubmit
to: I have on this occaſion, (as on the two preceding ones) wholly reſted
my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon ſuch poor abilities, as I am maſter of; I am not
conſcious of having drawn any particular aſſiſtance, either in
reſpect of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or deſign, from the productions of others; altho' I
am far from preſuming to ſay or think, that I have ever exhibited any
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter purely original: The level manners of a poliſh'd country, like
this, do not ſupply much matter for the comic muſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in
variety and extravagance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore I have made any attempts at
novelty, I have found myſelf obliged either to dive into the lower claſs of
men, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take myſelf to the out-ſkirts of the empire; the center is too
equal and refined for ſuch purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Whether the reception of this Comedy may be ſuch, as ſhall
encourage me to future efforts, is of ſmall conſequence to the public; 
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0110602200:6"/> but if it ſhould chance to obtain ſome little credit
with the candid part of mankind, and it's author for once eſcape without
thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and unworthy aſperſions, which writers, who hide their
own names, fling on them who publiſh their's, my ſucceſs it may be hoped
will draw forth others to the undertaking with far ſuperior requiſites; and
that there are numbers under this deſcription, whoſe ſenſibility keeps
'em ſilent, I am well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded when I conſider how general it is for
men of the fineſt parts, to be ſubject to the fineſt feelings; and I
would ſubmit whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this unhandſome practice of abuſe, is not
calculated to create in the minds of men of genius, not only a diſinclination
to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in dramatic compoſitions, but a languid and unanimated manner of
executing them: It will drive men from a neceſſary confidence in their own
powers, and it will be thought convenient to get out of the torrent's way, by
mooring under the lee of ſome great name, either French or Italian, and
ſitting down contented with the humble, but leſs expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, taſk of
tranſlation. Should this take place, a cold elaborate ſtile will prevail in
our drama, clearly oppoſite to the national <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0110602200:7"/> character,
and not at all at uniſon with the taſte of our writers themſelves.
Correctneſs will become the chief object in view, by which, though much may
be avoided, little will be obtained: nothing great can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed on a
plain; turn to Shakeſpear, and you find the Alps not more irregular than his
genius; had the critics of his days marked his inaccuracies with that illiberal
ſpirit which ſeems reſerved for our time, the bold and daring ſallies
of the ſublimeſt Muſe would probably have been ſuppreſſed, and
neither the great Actor who has brought his ſcenes to life, nor the elegant

ſuch diſplay of their own genius in the celebration and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of

                  <p>IF Bridgemore has'nt ſhifted his abode, that is the houſe;
'twas there that eighteen years ago I loſt a wife, and left an infant
daughter. All-diſpoſing Providence, who haſt ordain'd me to this hour,
and thro' innumerable toils and dangers led me back to this affecting ſpot,
can it be wonder'd at, if I approach it with an anxious aching heart, uncertain
as I am if I have ſtill a child or not? What ſhall I do? If my Auguſta's
loſt, 'twere better I ſhould never enter thoſe ill-omen'd doors; if ſhe
ſurvives, how ſhall I diſcloſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and tell her ſhe has
ſtill a father? Oh, that unknown and unperceiv'd, I cou'd but catch a ſight
of her, gaze till I'd gratified my longing, and till this throbbing might
abate! I'll watch the door till ſomebody comes out, that I may ſpeak to.

years ago I conſign'd to him a cargo of great value from Scanderoon; if he
has robb'd me—but till I've ſeen my daughter, I'll ſuſpend enquiry.
Step with me into yonder tavern, there we'll concert the means of bringing
Bridgemore to an interview at Mr. Mortimer's. Come, my good benefactor, how

                  <p>I believe a little air will not be much amiſs for any of us.
Look at that girl; 'tis thus mortality encounters happineſs; 'tis thus the
inhabitant of earth meets that of heaven, with tears, with faintings, with
ſurprize: let others call this the weakneſs of our nature; to me it proves
the unworthineſs; for had we merits to entitle us to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the means
wou'd not be wanting to enjoy it.</p>

                  <p>Fear nothing; you will find him a new man; a deep inciſion has
let out the diſorder; and I hope a healthy regimen in time will heal the
wound; in ſhort I can't be idle; and now Frank is off my hands, I've once
more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to ſet this ricketty babe of quality upon his legs—Oh,
here he comes; why this is as it ſhould be; now you look like friends.</p>

Lady; your reproofs I bore with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure; but methinks was ſhe to
chide me, I ſhould ſink with ſhame.</p>

                  <p>You've nothing, my Lord Abberville, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend from me: I

                  <p>Give me thy hand, Auguſta—In the hope that I was
labouring for thy ſake, and in thy perſon that I ſhou'd reſtore the
proſtrate fortunes of an ancient houſe, I have toiled on through eighteen
years of weariſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture: crown'd with ſucceſs, I now at length
return, and find my daughter all my fondeſt hope could repreſent; but
paſt experience makes me provident; I would ſecure my treaſure; I would
beſtow it now in faithful hands—What ſay you, Sir, will you accept
the charge?

                  <p>Amen, ſay I. Live an example to the age; and when I read the

                  <p>O, Frank, 'tis hard to ſpeak the word, but you deſerve her;
yours is the road to happineſs; I have been loſt in error, but I ſhall

you: now begone; fly to the altars of your country lares; viſit that nurſe
of contemplation, ſolitude; and while you range your groves, that ſhook at
every rattle of the dice, aſk of your reaſon, why you was a gameſter.</p>

                  <p>Come, come, 'tis you that ſhou'd know better; in this poor

you, a citizen that ſhou'd be of the world, whoſe heart philoſophy and
travel might <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0110602200:76"/> have open'd, ſhou'd know better than to
join the cry with thoſe, whoſe charity, like the limitation of a brief,
ſtops ſhort at Berwick, and never circulates beyond the Tweed. By Heaven,
I'd rather weed out one ſuch unmanly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from the hearts of my
countrymen, than add another Indies to their empire.</p>
