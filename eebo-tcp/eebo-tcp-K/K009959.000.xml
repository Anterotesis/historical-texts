            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Year 1711, <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Prophet, who
formrrly Propheſied and Foretold you ſo many Remarkable
Things, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 1707; all which, as is well known, are
moſt exactly come to paſs; and having by my Knowledge and
Acquaintance for above One Hundred Years with the Stars, and
with utmoſt diligence applied my ſelf to know by the Aſpects of
Heavenly Bodies and other Methods; alſo what ſhall happen on
the Earth. I ſay, that I the aforeſaid <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
am moved, as well by Aſtrological Viſion, as the eſpecial <hi>Genius</hi>
of thoſe Powers which influences human Bodies, to make known
to the World what ſhall come to paſs.</p>
            <p>By this Prophetick Skill, I once amongſt other well known E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
Predicted and Foretold you, That <hi>John Partridge</hi> the
Almanack-maker ſhould Die, and be Buried on, or before ſuch a
day of the Month, which, as you all know, came to paſs to a
Moment.</p>
            <p>Having therefore obtained ſuch an undoubted Skill and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in theſe moſt uſeful and advantageous Things: I can no
longer refrain from letting my Country-men of this Nation, know
the great Revolutions of Kingdoms and States, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Things that ſhall ſuddenly come to paſs in the Earth. I am
alſo the more earneſtly moved to this great and wonderful Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
becauſe it is revealed to me by the ſame wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Skill, that ſuch great and terrible Things, ſuch ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Events, and ſuch Deſſolations, are preparing in the World,
and ſhall come to paſs this enſuing Year, as were never ſeen by
the Eyes of any Living, or would enter into the Conceptions of
any Man to foretell, had they not by an extraordinary acquired
Skill in knowing and determining ſuch Things, been foreſeen by

            <head>PROPHECY I.</head>
            <p>I Shall begin my Years of Wonders as the Courſe of
Nature begins it; Councils and Confederacies act
all the Courts and Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the time of
Year is only for ſuch Things; but as here the Seeds
of Blood are ſown, the plentiful Crop that is to follow,
derives from and is produced by the Private Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Men and Devils to diſturb the World.</p>
            <p>Three Scenes of Council ſhall this Month diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the World, what the Production or Effects ſhall
be of either of them, I ſhall farther lay open in my next;
theſe are Councils in this Nation, Councils of <hi>France,</hi>
Councils of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Councils of this Nation ſhall produce great Strife,
Faction and Malecontent ſtirs, with Heat and Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
among the ſeveral Parties that are among us, to the
great Encouragement of our Enemies, and to the great
Diſcouragement of good Men; yet the Calmneſs and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of ſome ſhall leſſen, or at leaſt protract the Danger
for a while; Diſputes of Eccleſiaſtick Affairs ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil
this Iſland, and thoſe People who regard neither
God nor Devil, ſhall make the greateſt ſtir about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
every Church (however ſafe) cries out they are
in danger, and the Debauchees of the Nation learn to
play the Phariſee, and ſay to their Neighbour, <hi>Stand off,
I am holier than thou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let <hi>Europe</hi> tremble at what is contriving now in the
Cabinets of Princes, which, like the Seeds of Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1090300500:4"/>
in the Body, will quickly break out in Feavors,
Fluxes, Cankers, Calentures, and all the Symbals of
the Bodily Diſtempers of Men in the Politicks of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> conſults now how to ſupport <hi>Spain,</hi> embroil
the Emperor, bring home the <hi>Swede,</hi> reſtore <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
doze <hi>Savoy,</hi> fright the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and divide the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
and he will in ſome Meaſure accompliſh them all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> conſults how to humble the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the <hi>Pole,</hi> and keep faſt the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>; but
the <hi>Swede</hi> will make a Cats Foot of the <hi>Turk.</hi> play him a
ſlipery Trick, get out of his hands, and leave him to
fight with the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> where the War
ſhall be bloody, cruel, ſucceſsful to neither ſide, and only
uſeful to ſhew God's Judgments on both.</p>

Struggles with themſelves to make their Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

            <p>The Confederates attempt vigorouſly to ſuccour King
<hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> but, <hi>O the Succeſs!</hi>—<hi>Spain</hi> not yet
ripe for Deliverance reſiſts her Friends, embraces her
Enemies, and ſtruggles hard againſt what ſhe believes ſhe
muſt at laſt ſubmit to.</p>
            <p>But this is not the Generation that muſt enjoy the
Fruit of this Strife, the Chiefs fight for the Poſſeſſion,
neither part obtain it, both take their long Journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the War is over, and the Game at Cheſs is left to

ſtill to defend themſelves againſt their own Happineſs.
<hi>Philip</hi> before he dies fights three Battles with the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and is Victor in two of them, but dies in <hi>May,</hi> and
leaves the War to be carried on with leſs Succeſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;

            <p>Now the <hi>Swedes</hi> prepare to break out of <hi>Pomeren,</hi> and
it appears that <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> are in a ſtrict Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy,

Corners of <hi>Europe</hi>; Kings and Emperors, ſhall flye
from this dreadful Enemy, but find no Receſs; Plague finds
them out, and as War ſpreads, Peſtilence goes hand in

            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> is all buſie in fitting out their Armies, the Drums
