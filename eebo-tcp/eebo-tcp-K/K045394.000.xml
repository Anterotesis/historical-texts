         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Becauſe a man's trials in trade being often greater, they give him freſh means of glorifying God, and proving the ſincerity of his religion. A man, who mixes in buſineſs, is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties. Theſe will lead him, if he be a good man, to look more to GOD, than he perhaps would otherwiſe do. He ſees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are ſnares all around him, this makes him watchful; he feels that the enemy within is too ready to betray him, this makes him humble himſelf; while a ſenſe of his own difficulties make him tender to the failings of others.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1194600800:12"/>it has a great deal to do with it. Covetouſneſs, a deſire to make a good bargain, may riſe up in your heart. Selfiſhneſs, a ſpirit of monopoly, a wiſh to get all, in order to diſtreſs others; theſe are evil deſires, and muſt be ſubdued. Some opportunity of unfair gain offers, in which there may be much ſin, and yet little ſcandal. Here a Chriſtian will ſtop ſhort; he will recollect, that "he who maketh haſte to be rich ſhall hardly be innocent." Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſin may be on the ſide of your dealer—<hi>be</hi> may want to overreach <hi>you</hi>—this is provoking—you are tempted to violent anger, perhaps to ſwear— Here is a freſh demand on you for a ſpirit of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and moderation, as there was before for a ſpirit of juſtice and ſelf-denial. If, by God's grace, you get the victory over theſe temptations, you are the better man for having been called out to them. Always provided, that the temptation be not of your own ſeeking. If you give way, and ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe temptations, don't go and ſay that trade and buſineſs have made you covetous, paſſionate, and proſane. No, no; depend upon it, you were ſo before; you would have had all theſe evil ſeeds lurking in your heart, if you had been loitering about at home and doing nothing, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſin of idleneſs into the bargain. When you are buſy, the devil often tempts you; when you are idle, you tempt the devil. If buſineſs and the world call theſe evil tempers into action, buſineſs and the world call that Religion into action too which teaches us to reſiſt them. And in this you ſee the Week-day fruit of the Sunday's piety. 'Tis trade and buſineſs in the Week which call us to put our Sunday readings, praying, and Church, going into practice.</p>
