            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the Preface to my former Volume, I have accounted for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and Method, and Stile of thoſe Relations of my Travels: What I have more to ſay of that kind, is chiefly with reference to what I now offer the Reader. Thus far I have thought fit to change my Method in this Volume, as to divide it into diſtinct Parts, becauſe the Matters it treats of are ſo different from one another, in point of Time, or other Circumſtances: But ſtill in each Part I have taken the ſame courſe of making ſeveral Chapters, that this Volume might retain ſome Uniformity with the other.</p>
            <p>The Firſt of theſe is that Account I promiſed of my Voyages from <hi>Achin</hi> in <hi>Sumatra,</hi> to ſeveral Places in the <hi>E. Indies;</hi> of which I forbore to particularize in the former Volume, for Reaſons there mentioned. I have now more than diſcharg'd my ſelf of that Promiſe: For I have improved my own Obſervations, eſpecially as to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> by thoſe of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who made a conſiderable ſtay in that Kingdom. I am abundantly ſatisfied my Self of their Ability and Integrity; the proper Qualifications in things of this Nature: And could I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their leave, the <hi>Reader</hi> alſo ſhould have had the Satisfaction of knowing to whom he was to aſcribe ſeveral of thoſe particulars: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I have taken frequent Occaſions to diſtinguiſh in general what I ſaw, from what I was informed of. This part is the <hi>Supplement</hi> of what is contained in the <hi>former Volume;</hi> and compleats the <hi>Voyage round the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Part contains what relates to the Time I ſpent in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> either as a Logwood-Cutter, or a Trader to them. This was before I made my Voyage round the World, as the <hi>Reader</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: And upon this Occaſion, therefore, I have gone ſo far back, as to ſpeak of my firſt entrance upon this Rambling kind of Life. For the Account it gives of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> and the Neighbouring parts of <hi>Jucatan</hi> and <hi>New Spain,</hi> &amp;c. I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to the Work it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Part is an Account of the Winds, and Weather, Storms, Tides, and Currents of the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> round the World; which may be of Uſe towards the Improvement of <hi>Navigation,</hi> and that part of <hi>Natural Hiſtory.</hi> 'Tis the ſubſtance of what I have remark't or learnt, about Things of that kind, in ſo long a courſe of Roving upon the Seas: And tho' I have not omitted to ſpeak of theſe Matters in the ſeries of my Voyages, as occaſion offered, yet I thought it might not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable,
<pb facs="tcp:0799400300:5"/>
to put them together in one View alſo by themſelves, in a Methodical Diſcourſe, ranging the ſeveral Particulars under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Heads.</p>
            <p>To render theſe things the more intelligible, I have prefixed pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Maps:</hi> One to each of the foregoing Parts; but two to this of the Winds, &amp;c. that the Variety of Trade-Winds might ſome way be Pictured, as it were, to the Eye; and the Reader might be the leſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be confounded with the Multiplicity of words, denoting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points of the Compaſs, or other Terms neceſſary to the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal part of the Diſcourſe. Theſe Maps contain the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> and ſo much towards each Pole as was of Uſe to my Deſign: And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection differs in this only from the Common Maps, that in order to ſhew the <hi>Atlantick</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Oceans each in one entire view, the Diviſion of the Hemiſpheres is made, not at the firſt Meridian, (reckoning from <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriffe,</hi>) nor at the 350th, as is uſual alſo, and as 'tis in the Globe-Map, prefixed to my firſt Volume, but at the 300th; yet ſtill retaining the common Graduation in the <hi>Equator,</hi> from that cuſtomary Meridian of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> or C. <hi>Verd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this mention of the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, there is one thing I would obſerve to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that I uſe that name not only for the North Sea, as 'tis called, but for this whole Ocean, on both ſides of the <hi>Equator</hi> between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> on one hand, and <hi>America</hi> on the other. If I be queſtioned for taking this Liberty, I ſhould think it enough to ſay, that I wanted a general name for this whole Ocean, and I could not find one more proper. And yet even as to the Reaſon of the thing, if the Diſcovery of a Sea to the South of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> or the <hi>Mexican</hi> Coaſt, were ground ſufficient for the extending the Name of the <hi>South Sea</hi> to all that largeſt Ocean of the World, tho' it lies Weſt rather of the whole Continent of <hi>America;</hi> much more may I be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a leſs conſiderable Enlargement of the Name of <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, which others have long ſince extended to ſo great a part of this Ocean, from its Original narrow Confines, the Neighbourhood of Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> I know that ſo much of this Ocean as lies South of the R. <hi>Niger,</hi> went uſually by the Name of the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Sea: Yet I can't learn a ſufficient Reaſon for it: For tho' 'tis true, that the Ancients call'd all the South parts of <hi>Africk</hi> to each Sea, <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> yet even upon this bottom, the Name of <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Sea ſhould have been left common to the Oceans on each ſide of the Cape of <hi>Good Hope.</hi> But if the Name muſt be appropriated, why to this on the Weſt of <hi>Africa?</hi> why not rather to that on its E. Coaſt? which lies nearer the <hi>Inward</hi> or more <hi>proper Aethiopia,</hi> now the <hi>Abiſſine</hi> Empire; and conſequently might better be called <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Sea. Accordingly I have ventured to call it ſo, <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>page</hi> 289. making it there the ſame as the <hi>Indian;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0799400300:6"/>
which I alſo make to be all the Ocean from the Eaſt Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> to the remoteſt of the <hi>E. India</hi> Iſlands, <hi>New Holland,</hi> and <hi>New Guinea:</hi> Tho' this Name alſo of <hi>Indian</hi> Sea has been underſtood, uſually, of narrower bounds. But be that as it will, I was for uſing comprehenſive Names; and therefore theſe three Names of <hi>Atlantick, Indian,</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Seas or Oceans, ſerve me for the whole Ambit of the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> and what elſe I have occaſion to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>To theſe three Parts is added a general <hi>Index</hi> of both <hi>Volumes.</hi> The firſt Volume ſhould not have been publiſhed without one, but that was reſerved to be annexed to this; that the Reader might not have the Trouble of turning over 2 Alphabets.</p>
            <p>Thus what I deſigned as an Appendix to the former <hi>Volume,</hi> is grown to its ſelf a Volume anſwerable to the other. And I am ſenſible there is one part of the intended <hi>Appendix</hi> yet behind; <hi>viz.</hi> The Deſcriprion of the <hi>South Sea</hi> Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilot Books, &amp;c. I confeſs I had thoughts of crowding it into this Volume: But beſides the dryneſs and fatigue of ſuch a Work, and the ſmall leiſure I had for it, I was quite diſcouraged from attempting it, when upon a nearer View of the matter I found in thoſe Deſcriptions and Charts a repugnance with each other in many particulars; and ſome things which from my own Experience I knew to be erroneous. Indeed as they are they may be very uſeful to Sailors in thoſe Parts, being generally right enough in the main: But I was loth to undertake a Work, much of which muſt have conſiſted in correcting Miſtakes, and yet have left unaviodable many more to be rectified. Others may have Time and Helps for this Affair; and future Diſcoveries may give greater Light to direct them. To me it ſhall ſuffice, that bating this one particular, I have here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perform what I had made the Publick expect from me.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Reader will find upon peruſing my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> that I then omitted to ſpeak particularly of the excurſions I made to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> to <hi>Malacca, Fort St. George,</hi> and <hi>Bencouli,</hi> from <hi>Achin</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Sumatra;</hi> together with the Deſcription I intended to give of thoſe parts. I do but juſt mention them there; but ſhall now proceed to a more diſtinct account of them.</p>
                  <p>And to keep to the order of time, the Reader may recollect, that my firſt departure from <hi>Achin</hi> was to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> along with Captain <hi>Weldon,</hi> about <hi>July</hi> 1688. as I have ſaid p. 505th. of my former Volume. I have there related in a page or two before, to how weak a condition my ſelf and my Companions were brought, through the fatigues of our paſſage from <hi>Nicobar</hi> to <hi>Achin:</hi> yet did not my weakneſs take me off from contriving ſome employment or expedition, whereby I might have a comfortable ſubſiſtence. Captain <hi>Weldon</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> touched here, to ſell the Slaves he had brought with him from <hi>Fort St. George;</hi> it being in his way to the Streights of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> whither he was bound. This afforded me the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of trying that Voyage, to which he kindly invited me, and to which I was the more incouraged becauſe he had a good Surgeon in his Ship, whoſe Advice I needed: and my friend Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> was particularly animated thereby; who had alſo reſolved upon this Voyage, and was in a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er condition than my ſelf. Beſides, Capt. <hi>Weldon</hi> promiſed to buy a Sloop at <hi>Tonquin,</hi> of which he would make me Commander, to go a trading Voyage from thence to <hi>Cochinchina, Champa, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodia,</hi> or ſome others of the adjacent Countries: which Trade has been ſcarce, yet has been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Country-men, and there were hopes it might turn to a good account; but this project came to nothing.</p>
                  <p>However, Captain <hi>Weldon</hi> having finiſhed his buſineſs at <hi>Achin,</hi> I ſet out thence with him thro' the Streights of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and we ſoon arrived at the Town of <hi>Malacca:</hi> of which Town and Country, I ſhall have a better occaſion to ſpeak hereafter. Here we found the <hi>Caeſar of London,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Wright,</hi> who came from <hi>Bombay,</hi> and was bound to <hi>China.</hi> He ſtopt here to water and refreſh, as is uſual for Ships to do that paſs theſe Streights. By him we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that three other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships had touched here, and were paſt on to the Faſtward ten days before. Theſe 3 Ships came from <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> in company with Captain <hi>Weldon:</hi> but his buſineſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Here Captain <hi>Weldon</hi> took in Wood and Water, and ſome of the <hi>Indian</hi> Inhabitans came aboard us in their Canoas, of whom we bought a few Coco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Plantains, and freſh Fiſh. We ſtaid here not above 24 hours; for the other Ships had filled moſt of their Water at other Iſlands near this, before we came up with them: for tho' Ships do uſually take in Water at <hi>Malacca</hi> Town, yet they do as frequently diſcharge it again at ſome of theſe Iſlands, and take in better.</p>
                  <p>We ſailed the next day, and kept near the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca</hi> ſhore; and there paſſing by the Mouth of the River <hi>Jihore,</hi> we left many other Iſlands on our Starboard ſide.</p>
                  <p>The River of <hi>Jihore</hi> runs by the City of that name, which is the ſeat of the little Kingdom of <hi>Jihore.</hi> This Kingdom lies on the Continent of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and conſiſts of the extremity or doubling of that Promontory. It abounds with Pepper, and other goood Commodities.</p>
                  <p>They are a <hi>Mahometan</hi> People, very warlike, and deſirous of Trade. They delight much in Shipping and going to Sea, all the neighbouring

They coaſt about in their own Shipping to ſeveral parts of <hi>Sumatra, Java,</hi> &amp;c. their Veſſels are but ſmall, yet very ſerviceable; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> buy up a great many of them at a ſmall price, and make good trading Sloops of them. But they firſt fit them up after their own faſhion, and put a Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to them, which the <hi>Jihorians</hi> don't uſe, tho' they are very good Seamen in their way; but they make their Veſſels ſharp at each end, tho' but one end is uſed as the Head: and inſtead of a Rudder, they have on each ſide the Stern a thing like a very broad Oar, one of which they let down into the Water at pleaſure, as there is occaſion to ſteer the Ship either to the one ſide or the other, always letting down that which is to the Leeward. They have Proes of a particular neatneſs and curioſity. We call them Half-moon Proes, for they turn up ſo much at each end from the Water, that they much reſemble a Half-moon, with the Horns upwards. They are kept very clean, ſail well, and are much uſed by them in their Wars. The People of <hi>Jiſhore</hi> have formerly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get a Commerce with our Nation. For what reaſon that trade is neglected by us, I know not. The <hi>Dutch</hi> trade very much there; and have lately endeavoured to bring the King, who is very young, to their bow.</p>
                  <p>At the farther end of the Streights of <hi>Malacca,</hi> among many other Iſlands, we ſailed by thoſe of <hi>Pulo Oro,</hi> and <hi>Pulo Timaon:</hi> which laſt is a place often touched at for wood, water, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, tho' we paſt by it. Among other things, there are great plenty of excellent Green Turtle among theſe Iſlands.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Iſland lies in about 13 d. North.

They are called <hi>Champella de la Mar,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from others lying farther down in the Bay of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> called <hi>Champello de Terra.</hi> Theſe laſt lye in about 16 d. 45 m. North, but the Iſlands of <hi>Champello de la Mar</hi> lye in about 13d. 45m. N.</p>
                  <p>Over againſt theſe laſt Iſlands, on the Main, there is a large navigable River empties it ſelf into the Sea. The City of <hi>Quinam</hi> ſtands on the banks of this River, and is ſaid to be the principal City of the Kingdom of <hi>Cochinchina.</hi> As to its diſtance from the Sea, its bigneſs, ſtrength, riches, &amp;c. I am yet in the dark: only I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that if a Ship is caſt away on this Kingdom, the Seamen that eſcape drowning and get aſhore become Slaves to the King. Captain <hi>John Tiler</hi> was thus ſerv'd, and deſpaired of ever getting his freedom; but after a conſiderable ſtay there he was taken notice of by the King, and upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of returning thither again to trade there, he was ſent away. I ſailed in a Veſſel of his after this: but I never found him inclin'd to Trade thither any more. However, notwithſtanding this their ſeverity to Shipwrackt People, I have beeen informed by Captain <hi>Tiler</hi> and others, that they have a deſire to Trade, tho' they are yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the means to attain it. This deſire of Trade, they ſeem to have taken up from ſome <hi>Chineſe</hi> Fugitives, who fled from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> when they conquered their Country: and being kindly received by theſe <hi>Cochinchineſe,</hi> and having among them many Artificers, they inſtructed their kind protectors in many uſeful Arts, of which they were wholly ignorant before. 'Tis probable this their cuſtom of ſeizing Shipwrackt Seamen may ſoon vaniſh by the coming in of Trade, which is already

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> advancing among them; for the Merchants of <hi>China</hi> do now drive ſome ſmall traffick among theſe people, and fetch thence ſome ſmall quantities of Pepper, <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Aguala</hi> Wood, which is much eſteemed for its rare ſcent, and is very valuable in other places of <hi>India.</hi> They alſo fetch Betle from hence, it growing here in great plenty. I have had no account of any Shipping the <hi>Cochinchineſe</hi> have of their own, but I have met with them in their open Boats of 4, 5, or 6 Tun; imploying themſelves chiefly in getting Pitch and Tar from <hi>Pulo Condore,</hi> in fiſhing about the Coaſt and Iſland to get Oyl, and in fetching <hi>Aguala</hi> Wood from the Bay of <hi>Siam;</hi> which, whether it grows there or no, I can't tell, but I have heard that 'tis only Drift-wood caſt aſhore by the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The ſeizing Shipwrackt men has been alſo a cuſtom at <hi>Pegu,</hi> but whether ſtill continued I know not. They lookt on ſuch as men preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, purpoſely for them to feed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and therefore the King ordered them to be maintained by his Subjects; neither was any work required of them, but they had liberty to beg. By this means they got food and rayment from the Inhabitants, who were zealouſly chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed; we kept a little without all the Iſlands, and coaſting 5 or 6 leagues further, we ſtood right over towards the N. E. Cod of the Bay of <hi>Tonquin.</hi> The Bay of <hi>Tonquin</hi> has its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance between the S.

I have ſeen many of their Ships, ſome of 100 Tun, with Outlagers on both ſides, and others like ordinary Jonks, without Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers; but am wholly ignorant of their Trade, any farther than what I have mentioned of their having Pearl Oyſters there, in the 7th Chapter of my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> page 174.</p>
                  <p>Near the Cod of the Bay of <hi>Tonquin</hi> there are abundance of ſmall Iſlands, of which I ſhall ſpeak more hereafter. The mouth of the Bay ſeems to be barred up with the great ſhole of <hi>Pracel,</hi> which lies ſtretched at length before it, yet leaving two wide Channels, one at each end; ſo that Ships may paſs in or out either way. And therefore even the Ships that are bound from the Streigths of <hi>Malacca</hi> or <hi>Siam</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> may as well paſs to and from within the ſhole as without.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Tonquin</hi> is about 30 leagues wide in the broadeſt place. There is good ſounding and anchoring all over it: and in the middle, where it is deepeſt, there is about 46 fathom water. There you have black Oaze, and dark Peppery Sand: but on the Weſt ſide there is reddiſh Oazy Sand. Beſide the other Iſlands before-mentioned, there are others of leſs note on the <hi>Cochinchina</hi> Coaſt; but none of them all above 4 or 5 miles from the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>In the bottom of the Bay alſo, there are ſome ſmall Iſlands, cloſe by the <hi>Tonquin</hi> ſhore: 2 of theſe are of eſpecial note, not for their bigneſs, but for Sea-marks for the 2 principal Rivers, or Mouth rather of the chief River of <hi>Tonquin.</hi> One of theſe Rivers or Mouths, is called <hi>Rokbo.</hi> It diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea near the the N.

About a League to the Weſtward of this Rivers mouth, there is a ſmall pretty high Iſland call'd <hi>Fiſhers Iſland.</hi> It lieth about 2 mile from the ſhore, and it hath good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring about it in 17 or 18 foot water: and therefore it is not only a Sea-mark for the River, but a ſecure place to ride in, and very convenient for Ships to anchor at, to ſhelter themſelves when they come hither, eſpecially if they have not a preſent opportunity to enter the River; either becauſe of coming too late in the year, or being hindred by bad weather.</p>
                  <p>The other River or Mouth, was that by which we entered; and 'tis larger and deeper than the former. I know not its particular name; but for diſtinction I ſhall call it the River of <hi>Domea;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Town of note, that I ſaw on its bank was ſo called. The mouth of the River is in lat. 20 d. 45 m. It diſembogues 20 leagues to the N. E. of <hi>Rokbo.</hi> There are many dangerous Sands and Shoals between theſe 2 Rivers, which ſtretch into the Sea 2 leagues or more: and all the Coaſt, even from the <hi>Cochinchina</hi> ſhore on the Weſt, to <hi>China</hi> on the Eaſt, admits of Shoals and Sands, which yet in ſome places lie ſtretched farther off from the ſhore than in others.</p>
                  <p>This River of <hi>Domea</hi> is that by which moſt <hi>European</hi> Ships enter, for the ſake of its depth: yet here is a Bar of near 2 mile broad, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is about half a mile broad, having Sands on each ſide. The depth of the River is various at different times and ſeaſons, by the relation of the Pilots who are beſt acquainted here: for at ſome times of the year here is not above 15 or 16 foot water on a ſpring tide; and at other times here are 26 or 27 foot. The higheſt tides are ſaid to he in the month of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>

                  <p>The Channel of the Bar is hard Sand, which makes it the more dangerous: and the Tides whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Sands, ſet divers ways in a Tides time; which makes it the more dangerous ſtill. Therefore Ships that come hither, commonly wait for a Pilot to direct them, and if they arrive when it is Nepe-tide, they muſt ſtay for a Spring before a Pilot will come off to take charge of them. The mark of this River is a great high ridgy Mountain in the Country, called the <hi>Elephant.</hi> This muſt be brought to bear N. W. by N: then ſteering towards the ſhore, the water runs ſhallower, till you come into 6 fathom, and then you will be 2 or 3 miles from the foot or entrance of the Bar, and about the ſame diſtance from a ſmall Iſland called <hi>Pearl Iſland;</hi> which will then bear neareſt N. N. E. Having theſe marks and depth, you may anchor, and wait for a Pilot.</p>
                  <p>The Pilots for this River are Fiſhermen, who live at a Village called <hi>Batſha,</hi> at the mouth of the River; ſo ſeated, that they can ſee all Ships that wait for a Pilot, and hear the Guns too, that are often fired as ſignals by <hi>Europeans,</hi> to give notice of their arrival.</p>
                  <p>It was in the road before the Bar, in ſight of the <hi>Elephant</hi> Land, that we found the <hi>Rainbow</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Captain <hi>Pool</hi> Commander, riding and waiting for a Pilot, when we and Captain <hi>Lacy</hi> arrived.

Being got over the Bar, we found it deeper, and the bottom ſoft Oaz. The River at its mouth is above a mile wide, but grows narrower as you run farther up. We had a moderate Sea-breeze, and having a good tide of flood, made the beſt of it to reach to our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring place.</p>
                  <p>Having run about 5 or 6 leagues up the River, we paſt by a Village called <hi>Domea.</hi> This is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Village: and 'twas the firſt of note that we ſaw ſtanding on the banks. 'Tis ſeated on the Starboard ſide going up, and ſo nigh the River, that the tide ſometimes waſhes the walls of the Houſes, for the tide riſes and falls here 9 or 10 foot. This Village conſiſts of about 100 Houſes. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships that trade here do always lye in the River before this Town, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen, by their annual returns hither from <hi>Batavia,</hi> are very intimate with the Natives, and as free here as at their own homes: for the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> in general are a very ſociable people, eſpecially the traders and poorer ſort: but of this more in its proper place. The <hi>Dutch</hi> have inſtructed the Natives in the art of Gardening: by which means they have abundance of Herbage for Sallading; which among other things is a great refreſhment to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when they arrive here.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the <hi>Dutch</hi> who come to trade in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, go no higher with their Ships than this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea,</hi> yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> uſually go about 3 mile farther up, and there lye at anchor during their ſtay in this Country. We did ſo at this time, and paſſing by <hi>Domea</hi> came to an anchor at that diſtance. The tide is not ſo ſtrong here as at <hi>Domea;</hi> but we found not one houſe near it: yet our Ships had not lain their many days before the Natives came from

This is no unuſual thing in other parts of <hi>India,</hi> eſpecially where Ships lye long at a place, the poorer ſort of Natives taking this opportunity to truck and barter; and by ſome little offices, or begging, but eſpecially by bringing Women to let to hire, they get what they can of the Seamen.</p>
                  <p>This place where our Ships rode at anchor was not above 20 miles from the Sea: but the Trade of the Kingdom is driven at <hi>Cachao,</hi> the principal City; where for that reaſon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Companies have each of them their Factors conſtantly reſiding. The City was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the River, about 80 miles from our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring place; and our Captains got themſelves in a readineſs to go up thither; it being uſual to ſend up the goods in the Country Boats, which are large and commodious enough; and the hire is pretty reaſonable both for the Veſſels, and the Men who manage them. They are <hi>Tonquineſe,</hi> and uſe both Oars and Sails. Our Factory at <hi>Cachao</hi> had news of our arrival before we came to an anchor, and immediately the chief of the Factory, with ſome of the King of <hi>Tonquin</hi>'s Officers, came down to us, by that time we had lain there about 4 or 5 days. The <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> Officers came to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Ships and Lading, and our Captains received them with great civility, firing of Guns, feaſting for two or three days, and preſents alſo at their return back to <hi>Cachao.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after their departure, the chief of the Factory returned thither again, and with him went our three Captains, and ſome others, among whom I got leave to go alſo. Captain <hi>Weldon</hi> had recommended me to the chief of the Factory, while he was aboard us: and my going up now to the

                  <p>We went from our Ships in the Country Boats we had hired, with the Tide of flood, and ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ebb: for the Tide runs ſtrong for 30 or 40 miles beyond the place where we left our Ships. Our Men contented themſelves with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their goods (The <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> being very light-finger'd) and left the managment of the Boats entirely to the Boats Crew. Their Boats have but one Maſt; and when the Wind is againſt them they take it down, and ply their Oars. As we advanced thus up the River, ſometimes rowing, ſometimes ſailing, we had a delightful proſpect over a large level fruitful Country. It was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally either Paſture or Rice-fields; and void of Trees, except only about the Villages, which ſtood thick, and appeared mighty pleaſant at a diſtance. There are many of theſe Villages ſtand cloſe to the Banks of the Rivers, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Trees on the backſide only, but open to the River.</p>
                  <p>When we came near any of theſe Villages, we were commonly encounter'd with Beggars, who came off to us in little Boats made of twigs, and plaiſtered over both inſide and outſide with Clay, but very leaky. Theſe were a poor Leprous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who for that reaſon are compell'd by the reſt to live by themſelves, and are permitted to beg publickly. As ſoon as they ſpied us they ſet up a loud doleful cry, and as we paſt by them we threw them out ſome Rice, which they received with great appearance of joy.</p>
                  <p>In about four days time we got to <hi>Hean,</hi> a Town on the Eaſt ſide of the River; which is here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: for a little before we came to <hi>Hean</hi> we met

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hean</hi> is about 60 miles from the place where we left our Ships, and about 80 from the Sea that way: But along the River or Channel <hi>Rokbo,</hi> where the Land trends more to the Southward, it ſeems to be farther diſtant from the Sea. 'Tis a conſiderable Town, of about 2000 Houſes: but the Inhabitants are moſt poor People and Soldiers, who keep a Garriſon there; tho' it has neither Walls, Fort, nor great Guns.</p>
                  <p>Here is one ſtreet belonging to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. For ſome years ago a great many lived at <hi>Cachao;</hi> till they grew ſo numerous, that the Natives themſelves were even ſwallowed up by them. The King taking notice of it, ordered them to remove from thence, allowing them to live any where but in the City. But the major part of them preſently forſook the Country, as not finding it convenient for them to live any where but at <hi>Cachao;</hi> becauſe that is the only place of Trade in the Country, and Trade is the Life of a <hi>Chineſe.</hi> However ſome of them were content to ſettle at <hi>Hean,</hi> where they have remained ever ſince.

There were two of theſe <hi>China</hi> Merchants who traded yearly to <hi>Japan,</hi> with raw and wrought Silks, bringing back Money chiefly. Theſe all of them wore long Hair braided behind, as their own Country faſhion was before the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Conqueſt.

They ride a-float in the middle of the River; for the Water does not riſe and fall much at this place: Neither is the flood diſcerned by the turning of the ſtream; for that always runs down, tho' not ſo ſwift near full Sea as at other times: for the tide preſſing againſt the ſtream, tho' faintly ſo far up the River, has not power to turn it, but only ſlackens its courſe, and makes the Water riſe a little.</p>
                  <p>The Governor or his Deputy gives his <hi>Chop</hi> or Paſs to all Veſſels that go up or down; not ſo much as a Boat being ſuffer'd to proceed without it.

                  <p>The Soil of this Country is generally very rich; That very low Land I ſpeak of towards the Sea, is moſt black Earth, and the mould pretty deep. In ſome places there's very ſtrong Clay. The Champian Land is generally yellowiſh or greyiſh earth, of a looſer and more friable ſubſtance than the former: yet in ſome places it has a touch of the Clay too. In the plain Country, near the Mountains laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there are ſaid to be ſome high ſteep rocks of Marble ſcattered up and down at unequal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which ſtanding in that large plain Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, are like ſo many great Towers or Caſtles: and they appear more viſible, becauſe the Land about them is not burdened with Wood, as in ſome places in its neighbourhood.</p>

The Country in general is very well watered; and by means of the great Navigable River and its Branches, it has the opportunity of Foreign Trade. This riſes about the Mountains in the North, or from beyond them; whence running Southerly toward the Sea, it paſſes thro' the before mentioned Plain of Marble Rocks, and by that time it comes to <hi>Cachao,</hi> which is about 40 or 50 miles to the South of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, 'tis about as broad as the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> yet ſo ſhallow in the dry Seaſon, as that it may be forded on Horſeback.

The other parts of the Province produce Lack and Silk, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Cachao,</hi> in the Heart of the Kingdom, lies between the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South Provinces: 'tis a Champian pleaſant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: the Soil is yellow or grey Earth: and 'tis pretty woody, with ſome Savannahs. It abounds with the two principal Commodities of their Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> Lack and Silk, and has ſome Rice: Nor are any of the Provinces deſtitute of theſe Commodities, tho' in different proportions, each according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Soil.</p>
                  <p>This Country has of its own growth all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Life of Man. They have little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for eatable Roots, having ſuch plenty of Rice; yet they have Yams and Potatoes for variety; which would thrive here as well as any where, were the Natives induſtrious to propagate them.</p>
                  <p>The Land is every where cloathed with Herbage of one kind or other; but the dry Land has the ſame Fate that moſt dry Lands have between the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> to be over-run with Purſlain; which growing wild, and being pernicious to other ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Herbs and Plants, they are at the pains to weed it out of their Fields and Gardens, tho' 'tis very ſweet, and makes a good Sallad for a hot Country.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſort of Herb very common in this Country, which grows wild in ſtagnant Ponds, and floats on the ſurface of the Water. It has a narrow, long, green thick Leaf. It is much eſteemed

This Country produces many other ſorts of wild Herbs; and their Gardens alſo are well furniſhed with pleaſant and wholeſome ones, eſpecially many Onions, of which here are great plenty.</p>
                  <p>Plantains and Bonanoes grow and thrive here as well as any where, but they are uſed here only as Fruit, and not for Bread, as in many places of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> Beſides theſe here are divers ſorts of excellent Fruits, both Ground-fruit and Tree fruit. The Ground-fruits are Pumpkins, Melons, Pine-apples, &amp;c. the Tree-fruits are Mangoes, a few Oranges, Limes, Coco-nuts, Guava's, Mulberries, their much eſteemed Betle, a Fruit called <hi>Lichea,</hi> &amp;c. The Oranges are of divers ſorts, and two of them more excellent than the reſt. One ſort is called <hi>Cam-chain,</hi> the other is call'd <hi>Cam-quit. Cam,</hi> in the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> Language, ſignifies an Orange, but what the diſtinguiſhing Words <hi>Cam</hi> and <hi>Quit</hi> ſignifie I know not.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cam-chain</hi> is a large Orange, of a yellowiſh colour: the rind is prety thick and rough; and the inſide is yellow like Amber. It has a moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſmell, and the taſte is very delicious. This ſort of Orange is the beſt that I did ever taſte; I believe there are not better in the World: A Man may eat freely of them; for they are ſo innocent that they are not denied to ſuch as have Fevers, and other ſick People.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cam-quit</hi> is a very ſmall round Fruit, not above half ſo big as the former. It is of a deep red colour, and the rind is very ſmooth and thin. The inſide alſo is very red, the taſte is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the <hi>Cam-chain,</hi> but it is accounted very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Fruit, eſpecially to ſuch as are ſubject to Fluxes; for it both creates and heightens that

Theſe 2 ſorts are very plentiful and cheap, and they are in ſeaſon from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> but then the <hi>Cham-chain</hi> becomes redder, and the rind is alſo thinner. The other ſorts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges are not much eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>The Limes of <hi>Tonquin</hi> are the largeſt I ever ſaw. They are commonly as big as an ordinary Limon, but rounder. The rind is of a pale yellow colour when ripe; very thin and ſmooth. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary juicy, but not near ſo ſharp or tart in taſte as the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Limes.</p>
                  <p>Coco-nnts and Guava's do thrive here very well: but there are not many of the latter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Betle</hi> of <hi>Tonquin</hi> is ſaid to be the beſt in <hi>India;</hi> there is great plenty of it; and 'tis moſt eſteemed when it is young, green and tender; for 'tis then very juicy. At <hi>Mindanao</hi> alſo they like it beſt green: but in other places of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> it is commonly chew'd when it is hard and dry.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lichea</hi> is another delicate Fruit. 'Tis as big as a ſmall Pear, ſomewhat long ſhaped, of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour, the rind pretty thick and rough, the inſide white, incloſing a large black kernel, in ſhape like a Bean.</p>
                  <p>The Country is in ſome part woody; but the low Land in general is either graſſy Paſture, or Rice Fields, only thick ſet with ſmall Groves, which ſtand ſcattering very pleaſantly over all the low-Country. The Trees in the Groves are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts, and moſt unknown to us. There is good Timber for building either Ships or Houſes, and indifferent good Maſts may here be had.</p>
                  <p>There is a Tree called by the Natives <hi>Pone,</hi> chiefly uſed for making Cabinets, or other Wares to be la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> Theſe grow plentifully in ſome places, eſpecially in the Champion Lands. Here are alſo Mulberry Trees in great plenty, to feed the Silk-worms, from whence comes the chief Trade in the Country. The Leaves of the old Trees are not ſo nouriſhing to the Silk-worms, as thoſe of the young Trees; and therefore they raiſe crops of young ones every year, to feed the Worms: for when the ſeaſon is over, the young Treees are pluckt up by the Roots, and more planted againſt the next year; ſo the Natives ſuffer none of theſe Trees to grow to bear Fruit. I heard of no Mulberries kept for eating, but ſome few raiſed by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants at <hi>Hean;</hi> and theſe bare but ſmall hungry Fruit.</p>
                  <p>Here is good plenty of Rice, eſpecially in the low Land, that is fatned by the overflowing Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. They have two crops every year, with great increaſe, if they have ſeaſonable Rains and Floods. One crop is in <hi>May,</hi> and the other in <hi>November:</hi> and tho' the low Land is ſometimes overflown with Water in the time of Harveſt, yet they matter it not, but gather the crop and fetch it home wet in their Canoas; and making the Rice faſt in ſmall bundles, hang it up on their Houſes to dry. This ſerves them for Bread-corn; and as the Country is very kindly for it, ſo their Inhabitants live chiefly of it.</p>
                  <p>Of Land-Animals in this Country there are Elephants, Horſes, Buffaloes, Bullocks, Goats, Deer, a few Sheep for the King, Hogs, Dogs, Cats, Lizards, Snakes, Scorpions, Centapees, Toads, Frogs, &amp;c. The Country is ſo very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that they have but few Deer or wild Game for hunting, unleſs it be in the remoter parts of the Kingdom. But they have abundance of Fowls both tame and wild. The tame Fowls are Cocks and Hens, and Ducks alſo in great plenty, of the ſame ſort with ours. The Inhabitants have little

There are alſo ſome Geeſe, Parrots, Partridges, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites, Turtle-Doves, &amp;c. with many ſorts of ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Birds. Of wild Water-fowls they have Ducks, Widgeons, Teals, Herons, Pellicans, and Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catchers, (which I ſhall deſcribe in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi>) and other ſmaller Water-fowls. The Duck, Widgeon, and Teal are innumerable: They breed here in the Months of <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> then they fly only in couples: but from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>March</hi> you will ſee over all the low watry Lands great Companies together: and I have no where ſeen ſuch large flights, nor ſuch plenty of Game. They are very ſhy ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſettled here; for now the Natives as well as they ſhoot them: but before their arrival the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> took them only with Nets, neither is this cuſtom left off yet. The Net that is uſed for this Game is made ſquare, and either bigger or leſs according as they have occaſion. They fix two Poles about 10 or 11 foot high, upright in the Ground, near the Pond, where the Ducks haunt; and the Net has a head-cord, which is ſtretched out ſtreight, made from the top of one Pole to the other; from whence the lower part of the Net hangs down looſe towards the Ground; and when in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they fly towards the Pond, many of them ſtrike againſt the Net, and are there entangled.</p>
                  <p>There is a kind of Locuſt in <hi>Tonquin,</hi> in great abundance. This Creature is about the bigneſs of the top of a Mans Finger, and as long as the firſt joynt. It breeds in the Earth, eſpecially in the Banks of Rivers and Ditches in the low Country. In the months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> which is the ſeaſon of taking them, being then only ſeen, this Creature firſt comes out of the Earth in huge

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> ſwarms. It is then of a whitiſh colour, having 2 ſmall Wings, like the Wings of a Bee: at its firſt coming out of the Earth it takes its flight; but for want of ſtrength or uſe falls down again in a ſhort time. Such as ſtrive to fly over the River, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall down into the Water and are drowned, or become a prey to the Fiſh of the River, or are carried out into the Sea to be devoured there: But the Natives in theſe Months watch the Rivers, and take up thence Multitudes, ſkimming them from off the Water with little Nets. They eat them freſh, broiled on the Coals; or pickle them to keep. They are plump and fat, and are much eſteemed both by rich and poor, as good wholeſome food, either freſh or pickled.</p>
                  <p>The Rivers and Ponds are ſtored with divers ſorts of excellent Fiſh, beſides abundance of Frogs, which they angle for, being highly eſteemed by the <hi>Tonquineſe.</hi> The Sea too contributes much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of poor People, by yielding plentiful ſtores of Fiſh, that ſwarm on this Coaſt in their ſeaſons, and which are commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before the River Fiſh. Of theſe here are divers ſorts, beſides Sea Turtle, which frequently come aſhore on the ſandy Bays in their ſeaſons to lay their Eggs. Here are alſo both Land-crabs and Sea-crabs good ſtore, and other Shell-fiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> Craw-fiſh, Shrimps, and Prawns. Here is one ſort of ſmall Fiſh much like an <hi>Anchovy,</hi> both in ſhape and ſize, which is very good pickled. There are other ſorts of ſmall Fiſh, which I know not the names of. One ſort of them comes in great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Balachaun</hi> is a compoſition of a ſtrong favour; yet a very delightſom Diſh to the Natives of this Country. To make it, they throw the mixture of Shrimps and ſmall Fiſh into a ſort of weak pickle made with Salt and Water, and put it into a tight earthen Veſſel or Jar. The pickle being thus weak, it keeps not the Fiſh firm and hard, neither is it probably ſo deſigned, for the Fiſh are never gutted. Therefore in a ſhort time they turn all to a maſh in the Veſſel; and when they have lain thus a good while, ſo that the Fiſh is reduced to a Pap, they then draw off the Liquor into freſh Jars, and preſerve it for uſe. The maſht Fiſh that remains behind is called <hi>Balachaun,</hi> and the liquor pour'd off is called <hi>Nuke-mum.</hi> The poor People eat the <hi>Balachaun</hi> with their Rice. 'Tis rank ſcented, yet the taſte is not altogether unpleaſant; but rather ſavory, after one is a little uſed to it. The <hi>Nuke-mum</hi> is of a pale brown colour, inclining to grey; and pretty clear. It is alſo very ſavory and uſed as a good ſauce for Fowls, not only by the Natives, but alſo by many <hi>Europeans,</hi> who eſteem it equal with <hi>Soy.</hi> I have been told that <hi>Soy</hi> is made partly with a fiſhy compoſition, and it ſeems moſt likely by the taſte: tho a Gentleman of my acquaintance, who was very intimate with one that ſailed often from <hi>Tonquin</hi> to <hi>Japan,</hi> from whence the true <hi>Soy</hi> comes, told me, that it was made only with Wheat, and a ſort of Beans mixt with Water and Salt.</p>
                  <p>Their way of Fiſhing differs little from ours: in the Rivers they take ſome of their Fiſh with Hook and Line, others with Nets of ſeveral ſorts. At the Mouths of the Rivers they ſet Nets againſt the Stream or Tide. Theſe have two long Wings opening on each ſide the Mouth of the Net, to guide the Fiſh into it; where paſſing through a narrow neck, they are caught in a bag at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> Where the Rivers mouth is ſo wide, that the wing of the Net will not reach from ſide to ſide, as at <hi>Batſha</hi> particularly it will not, there they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that defect, with long ſlender Canes, which they ſtick upright near one another in a row: for on both ſides of the River, when the tide runs ſtrong (which is the time that the Fiſh are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) the limber Canes make ſuch a rattling by ſtriking againſt each other, that thereby the Fiſh are ſcared from thence towards the Mouth of the Net, in the middle of the ſtream. Farther up the River, they have Nets made ſquare like a great ſheet. This ſort hath two long Poles laid acroſs each other. At this croſſing of the Poles a long Rope is faſtned; and the Net hangs down in a bag by its corners from them. To manage it there is a ſubſtantial poſt, ſet upright and firm in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and the top of it may be 8 or 10 foot above the water. On the top of this poſt there is a Mortice made to receive a long pole, that lies athwart like the Beam of a Balance: to the heavier end of which they tie the Rope, which holds the Net; and to the other end another Rope to pull up the Net on occaſion. The Fiſhermen ſink it with Stones to the Rivers bottom, and when they ſee any Fiſh come over it, one ſuddenly pulls the Rope at the oppoſite end of the Beam, and heaves Net and Fiſh out of the Water. They take a great deal of Fiſh this way: and ſometimes they uſe Drag-Nets, which go quite acroſs, and ſweep the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtagnant Ponds, ſuch as the <hi>Mandarins</hi> have commonly about their Houſes, they go in and trouble the water with their feet, till 'tis all mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and thick: and as the Fiſh riſe to the furface they take what they pleaſe with ſmall Nets, faſtned to a hoop, at the end of a pole.</p>

Theſe Markets are abundantly more ſtor'd with Rice (as being their chief ſubſiſtence, eſpecially of the poorer ſort) than either with Fleſh or Fiſh, yet wants there not for Pork, and young Pigs good ſtore, Ducks and Hens, plenty of Eggs, Fiſh great and ſmall, freſh and ſalted <hi>Balachaun</hi> and <hi>Nuke-Mum;</hi> with all ſorts of Roots, Herbs, and Fruits, even in theſe Country Markets. But at <hi>Cachao,</hi> where there are Markets kept every day, they have beſides theſe, Beef of Bullocks, Buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes Fleſh, Goats Fleſh, Horſe Fleſh, Cats and Dogs, (as I have been told) and Locuſts.</p>
                  <p>They dreſs their food very cleanly, and make ſavory: for which they have ſeveral ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in <hi>Europe;</hi> but they have many ſorts of diſhes, that would turn the Stomach of a Stranger, which yet they themſelves like very well, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, a diſh of raw Pork, which is very cheap and common. This is only Pork cut and minced very ſmall, fat and lean together; which being afterwards made up in balls, or rolls like Sauſages, and preſt very hard together, is then neatly wrapt up in clean Leaves, and without more ado, ſerved up to the Table. Raw Beef is another diſh, much eſteemed at <hi>Cachao.</hi> When they kill a Bullock they ſinge the hair off with Fire, as we ſinge Bacon-Hogs in <hi>England.</hi> Then they open it; and while the Fleſh is yet hot, they cut good Collops from off the lean parts, and put them into a very tart Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, where it remains 3 or 4 hours longer, till it is ſufficiently ſoaked, and then, without more trouble, they take it out, and eat it with great delight.

Elephants they eat alſo; and the Trunk of this Beaſt is an acceptable preſent for a Nobleman, and that too tho' the Beaſt dyes with Age or Sickneſs. For here are but few wild Elephants, and thoſe ſo ſhy, that they are not eaſily taken. But the King having a great number of tame Elephants, when one of theſe dyes, 'tis given to the poor, who preſently fetch away the Fleſh, but the Trunk is cut in pieces, and preſented to the <hi>Mandarins.</hi> Dogs and Cats are killed purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Shambles, and their Fleſh is much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by people of the beſt faſhion, as I have been credibly informed. Great yellow Frogs alſo are much admired, eſpecially when they come freſh out of the Pond. They have many other ſuch choice diſhes: and in all the Villages, at any time of the day, be it Market day or not, there are ſeveral to be ſold by poor people, who make it their Trade. The moſt common ſorts of Cookeries, next to boiled Rice, is to dreſs little bits of Pork, ſpitted 5 or 6 of them at once on a ſmall ſkiver, and roaſted. In the Markets alſo, and daily in every Village, there are Women ſitting in the Streets, with a Pipkin over a ſmall Fire, full of <hi>Chau,</hi> as they call it, a ſort of very ordinary Tea, of a reddiſh brown colour, and 'tis their ordinary drink.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Tonquin</hi> is in general healthy enough, eſpecially in the dry ſeaſon, when alſo it is very delightſom. For the ſeaſons of the year

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> at <hi>Tonquin</hi> and all the Countries between the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed into Wet and Dry, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as others are into Winter and Summer: But as the alteration from Winter to Summer, and <hi>vice verſa</hi> is not made of a ſudden, but with the interchangeable Weather of Spring and Autumn; ſo alſo towards the end of the dry ſeaſon, there are ſome gentle ſhowers now and then, that precede the violent wet months; and again toward the end of theſe, ſeveral fair days that introduce the dry time. Theſe ſeaſons are generally much alike at the ſame time of the year in all places of the Torrid Zone, on the ſame ſide of the <hi>Equator:</hi> but for 2 or 3 degrees on each ſide of it, the weather is more mixt and uncertain, (tho' inclining to the wet extreme) and is often contrary to that which is then ſettled on the ſame ſide of the <hi>Equator</hi> more toward the Tropick. So that even when the wet ſeaſon is ſet in, in the Northern parts of the Torrid Zone, it may yet be dry weather for 2 or 3 degrees North of the Line: and the ſame may be ſaid of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Latitudes and Seaſons. This I ſpeak with reſpect to the dryneſs or moiſture of Countries in the Torrid Zone: but it may alſo hold good of their Heat or Cold, generally: for as to all theſe qualities there is a further difference ariſes from the make or ſituation of the Land, or other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſes, beſides what depends on the reſpective latitude or regard to the Sun. Thus the Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and that of <hi>Bengal</hi> in the Eaſt, in much the ſame latitude, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot and moiſt; and whether their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being very low Countries, and the ſcarcity and faintneſs of the Sea-breezes, as in moſt Bays, may not contribute hereunto, I leave others to judge. Yet even as to the Latitudes of theſe places, lying near the Tropicks, they are generally upon that account alone more inclined to great Heats,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0799400300:41"/>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> than places near the Equator. This is what I have experienc'd in many places in ſuch Latitudes both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that the hotteſt parts of the World are theſe near the Tropicks, eſpecially 3 or 4 Degrees within them; ſenſibly hotter than under the Line it ſelf. Many reaſons may be aſſign'd for this, beſide the accidental ones from the make of the particular Countries, Tropical Winds, or the like. For the longeſt day at the Equator never exceeds 12 Hours, and the Night is always of the ſame length: But near the Tropicks the longeſt day is about 13 hours and an half; and an hour and an half being alſo taken from the Night, what with the length of the day, and the ſhortneſs of the night, there is a difference of three hours: which is very conſiderable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, at ſuch places as are about 3 Degrees within the Tropicks, or in the Lat. of 20 Deg. N. the Sun comes within 2 or 3 degrees of the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith in the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> and having paſt the Zenith, goes not above 2 or 3 degrees beyond it, before it returns and paſſeth the Zenith once more; and by this means is at leaſt 3 Months within 4 degrees of the Zenith: ſo that they have the Sun in a manner over their Heads from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May,</hi> till the latter end of <hi>July.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when the Sun comes under the Line, in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> it immediately poſts away to the North or the South, and is not 20 days in paſſing from 3 degrees on one ſide, to 3 degrees on the other ſide the Line. So that by his ſmall ſtay there, the heat cannot be anſwerable to what it is near the Tropick, where he ſo long continues in a manner Vertical at Noon, and is ſo much longer above the Horrizon each particular day, with the intervening of a ſhorter Night.</p>

And as to the Torrid Zone, the yearly Floods, and their cauſe, are every where as well known by People there, as the Rivers themſelves. In <hi>America</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in <hi>Campeachy</hi> Rivers, in <hi>Rio Grande,</hi> and others, 'tis a vaſt havock is made by theſe Floods; bringing down ſometimes Trees of an incredible bigneſs; and theſe floods always come at the ſtated ſeaſon of the Year. In the dry part of <hi>Peru,</hi> along the Coaſts of <hi>Pacifick</hi> Sea, where it never rains, as it ſeldom does in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they have not only Floods, but Rivers themſelves, made by the annual falling of Rain on the Mountains within Land; the Channels of which are dry all the reſt of the year.

                  <p>This is ordinarily the ſtate of their year: yet are not theſe various Seaſons ſo exact in the returns, but that there may ſometimes be the difference of a month, or more. Neither yet are the ſeveral Seaſons, when they do come, altogether alike in all years. For ſometimes the Rains are more violent and laſting, at other times more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and ſome years they are not ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce reaſonable Crops, or elſe they come ſo unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably as to injure and deſtroy the Rice, or at leaſt to advance it but little. For the Husbandry of this Country, and other Countreys in the Torrid Zone depends on the Annual Floods, to moiſten and fatten the Land, and if the wet ſeaſons prove more dry than ordinary, ſo as that the Rice-Land is not well dranched with the overflowing of the Rivers, the Crops will be but mean: and Rice being their Bread, the ſtaff of Life with them, if that fails, ſuch a populous Country as this cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being beholding to its Neighbours. But when it comes to that paſs, that they muſt be ſupplied by Sea, many of the poorer ſort ſell their Children to relieve their wants, and ſo preſerve their Lives, whilſt others that have not Children to ſell, may be famiſhed and dye miſerable in the Streets. This manner of Parents dealing with their Children is not peculiar to this Kingdom alone, but is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary in other places of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially on the Coaſts of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Coromandel.</hi> There a famine happens more frequently, and rages ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a degree beyond belief: for thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> are generally very dry, and leſs productive of Rice than <hi>Tonquin.</hi> Neither are they ſuch large Rivers to fatten the Land: but all their Crop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on Seaſons of Rains only, to moiſten the earth: and when thoſe ſeaſons fail, as they do very often, then they can have no Crop at all. Sometimes they have little or no rain in three or fore years, and then they periſh at a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable rate. Such a Famine as this hapned 2 or 3 years before my going to <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> which raged ſo ſore, that thouſands of people periſhed for want, and happy were they that could hold out till they got to the Sea-port Towns, where the <hi>Europeans</hi> lived, to ſell themſelves to them, tho' they were ſure to be tranſported from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try preſently. But the famine does never rage ſo much at <hi>Tonquin,</hi> neither may their greateſt ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city be ſo truly called a famine: for in the worſt of times there is Rice, and 'tis thro' the poverty of the meaner people, that ſo many periſh or ſell their Children, for they might elſe have Rice enough, had they money to buy it with: and when their Rice is thus dear, all other proviſions are ſo proportionably.</p>
                  <p>There is a further difference between the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and this of <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> that the more Rain they have there, the greater is their bleſſing: but here they may have too much rain for the lower part of the Kingdom; but that is rare. When this happens they have Banks to keep in the Rivers, and Ditches to drain the Land; tho' ſometimes to little purpoſe, when the floods are violent, and eſpecially if out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For if the floods come in their ſeaſons, tho' they are great, and drown all the Land, yet are they not hurtful; but on the contrary, very beneficial, becauſe the mud that they leave behind fattens the Land. And after all, if the low Land

                     <label type="milestone">

In the dry ſeaſons the low Lands have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that Channels are eaſily cut out of the River, to water them on each ſide. So that let the Seaſons be wet or dry this Country ſeldom ſuffers much. Indeed conſidering the Number of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and the poverty of the Major part, it is ſometimes here, as in all populous Countries, very hard with the poor, eſpecially the Trades-people in the large Towns. For the Trade is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the people are imployed according to the number of Ships that come thither, to fetch away their Goods: and if but few Ships come hither, as ſometimes it happens, then the poor are ready to famiſh for want of work, whereby to get a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And not only this, but moſt Silk Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are ſtockt with great multitudes of poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who work cheap and live meanly on a little Rice; which if it is not very cheap, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is here, the poor people are not able to maintain themſelves.</p>

                     <hi>TOnquin</hi> is very populous, being thick ſet with Villages; and the Natives in general are of a middle ſtature, and clean limb'd. They are of a Tawny <hi>Indian</hi> colour: but I think the faireſt and cleareſt that I ever ſaw of that Complexion: for you may perceive a bluſh or change of colour in ſome of their faces, on any ſudden ſurprize of paſſion; which I could never diſcern in any other <hi>Indians.</hi> Their faces are generally flattiſh, and of an oval form. Their noſes and lips are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable enough, and altogether graceful. Their hair is black, long and lank, and very thick; and they wear it hanging down to their ſhoulders.</p>

They do this when they are about 12 or 14 years old, both Boys and Girls: and during all the time of the operation they dare not take any nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, beſides Water, Chau, or ſome liquid thing, and not much of that neither, for fear, I judge, of being poyſon'd by the Dye, or Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that while this is doing they undergo very ſevere Penance: but as both Sexes, ſo all Qualities, the poor as well as the rich, muſt be in this faſhion: they ſay they ſhould elſe be like Brutes; and that would be a great ſhame to them to be like Elephants or Dogs; which they compare thoſe to that have white teeth.</p>
                  <p>They are generally dextrous, nimble, and active; and ingenious in any Mechannick Science they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. This may be ſeen by the multitude of fine Silks that are made here; and the curious Lacker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, that is yearly tranſported from thence. They are alſo laborious and diligent in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; but the Country being ſo very populous, many of them are extreme poor for want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: and tho' the Country is full of Silk, and other materials to work on, yet little is done, but when ſtrange Ships arrive. For 'tis the Money and goods that are brought hither, eſpecially by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> that puts life into them: for the Handicrafts men have not Money to ſet themſelves to work; and the Foreign Merchants are therefore forced to truſt them with advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, to the value of at leaſt a third, or half their goods; and this for 2 or 3 months or more, before they have made their Goods, and brought them in. So that they having no Goods ready by them, till they have Money from the Merchant ſtrangers, the Ships that trade hither muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

They are patient in labour, but in ſickneſs they are mightily dejected. They have one great fault extreme common among them, which is gaming. To this they are ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally addicted, Servants and all, that neither the awe of their Maſters, nor any thing elſe, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to reſtrain them, till they have loſt all they have, even their very Cloaths. This is a reigning Vice among the Eaſtern Nations, eſpecially the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> as I ſaid in the 15th Chaper of my former Volume. And I may add, that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> I found ſettled at <hi>Tonquin,</hi> were no leſs given to it than thoſe I met with elſewhere. For after they have loſt their Money, Goods and Cloaths, they will ſtake down their Wives and Children: and laſtly, as the deareſt thing they have, will play upon tick, and mortgage their Hair upon honour: And whatever it coſt 'em they will be ſure to redeem it. For a free <hi>Chineſe,</hi> as theſe are, who have fled from the <hi>Tartars,</hi> would be as much aſhamed of ſhort Hair, as a <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> of white Teeth.</p>
                  <p>The Cloaths of the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> are made either of Silk or Cotton. The poor people and Soldiers do chiefly were Cotton Cloath died to a dark tawny colour. The rich men and <hi>Mandarins</hi> commonly were Engliſh Broad-cloath: the chief colours are red or green.

Theſe Hats are as ſtiff as boards, and ſit not plyant to their heads: for which reaſon they have Bandſtrings or Necklaces faſtned to their Hats; which coming under their chins are there tyed, to keep their Hats faſt to their Heads. Theſe Hats are very ordinary things; they ſeldom wear them but in rainy weather. Their other Cloaths are very few and mean: a ragged pair of Britches commonly ſufficeth them. Some have bad Jackets, but neither Shirt, Stockings nor Shooes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> buildings are but mean. Their Houſes are ſmall and low: the Walls are either Mud, or Watle bedawbed over: and the Roofs are thatched, and that very ill, eſpecially in the Country. The Houſes are too low to admit of Chambers: yet they have here 2 or 3 partitions on the ground floor, made with a watling of Canes or Sticks, for their ſeveral uſes; in each of which there is a Window to let in the light. The Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are only ſmall ſquare holes in the Walls, which they ſhut up at night with a Board, fitted for that purpoſe. The Rooms are but meanly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; with a poor Bed or two (or more, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bigneſs of the family) in the inner Room. The outer Rooms are furniſhed with Stools, Benches, or Chairs to ſit on. There is alſo a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and on one ſide a little Altar, with two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe-pots on it; nor is any Houſe without its Altar.

                  <p>They dwell not in lone houſes, but together in Villages: 'tis rare to ſee a ſingle houſe by it ſelf. The Country Villages commonly conſiſt of 20, 30, or 40 houſes, and are thick ſeated over all the Country; yet hardly to be be ſeen till you come to their very doors, by reaſon of the Trees and Groves they are ſurrounded with. And 'tis as rare to ſee a Grove without a Village, in the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try near the Sea, as to ſee a Village without a Grove: but the high Lands are full of Woods, and the Villages there ſtand all as in one great Foreſt. The Villages and Land about them do moſt belong to great men, and the Inhabitants are Tenants that manure and cultivate the ground.</p>
                  <p>The Villages in the low Land are alſo ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great banks and deep ditches. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the whole Grove, in which each Village ſtands.</p>
                  <p>The banks are to keep the water from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing their gardens, and from coming into their houſes in the wet time, when all the Land about them is under water, 2 or 3 foot deep. The ditches or trenches are to preſerve the water in the dry time, with which they water their gardens when need requires. Every man lets water at pleaſure, by little drains that run inward from the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch, into his own garden; and uſually each mans yard or garden is parted from his neighbours by one of theſe little drains on each ſide. The houſes lie ſcattering up and down in the Grove; no where joyning to one another, but each apart, and fenced in with a ſmall hedge. Every houſe hath a ſmall gate or ſtile to enter into the garden firſt, for the houſe ſtands in the middle of it: and the gardens runs alſo from the backſide of the houſe

In the Gardens every Man has his own Fruit-trees, as Oranges, Limes, Betle; his Pumpkins, Melons, Pine-apples, and a great many Herbs. In the dry ſeaſon theſe Grovy dwellings are very pleaſant; but in the wet ſeaſon they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncomfortable: for tho' fenced in thus with banks, yet are they like ſo many Duck-houſes all wet and dirt: neither can they paſs from one Village to another, but Mid-leg or to their Knees in Water, unleſs ſometimes in Boats, which they keep for this purpoſe: But notwithſtanding theſe, they are ſeldom out of mire and wet, even in the midſt of the Village or Garden, ſo long as that ſeaſon laſts. The Inhabitants of the higher part of the Kingdom are not troubled with ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, but live more cleanly and comfortably, foraſmuch as their Land is never overflown with water: and tho' they live alſo in Villages or Towns as the former, yet they have no occaſion to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them with banks or trenches, but lie open to the Foreſt.</p>
                  <p>The Capital City <hi>Cachao,</hi> which ſtands in the high Country about 80 Miles from the Sea, on the Weſt ſide of the River, and on a pretty level, yet riſing Ground, lies open in the ſame manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wall, bank, or ditch. There may be in <hi>Cachao</hi> about 20000 Houſes. The Houſes are generally low, the walls of the Houſes are of mud, and the covering Thatch, yet ſome are built with Brick, and the covering with Pan-tile. Moſt of theſe Houſes have a Yard, or Back-ſide belonging to them. In each Yard, you ſhall ſee a ſmall arched building made ſomewhat like an Oven, about ſix foot high, with the Mouth on the Ground. It is built from top to bottom with brick, all over daub'd thick with mud and dirt. If any Houſe wants a yard, they have nevertheleſs ſuch a kind of Oven as this, but

The uſe of it is to thruſt their chiefeſt Goods into when a Fire happens: for theſe low thatch'd Houſes are very ſubject to take fire, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the dry times, to the Deſtruction of many Houſes in an inſtant, that often they have ſcarce time to ſecure their Goods in the arched Ovens, tho' ſo near them.</p>
                  <p>As every private Perſon hath this contrivance, to ſecure his own Goods, when a Fire happens, ſo the Government hath carefully ordered neceſſary means to be uſed for the preventing of Fire, or extinguiſhing it before it gets too great a Head. For in the beginning of the dry Seaſon every Man muſt keep a great Jar of Water, on the top of his Houſe, to be ready to pour down, as occaſion ſhall ſerve. Beſides this, he is to keep a long Pole, with a Baſket or Bowl at the end of it, to throw Water out of the Kennels upon the Houſes. But if the Fire gets to ſuch a head, that both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients fail, then they cut the Straps that hold the Thatch of the Houſes, and let it drop from the Rafters to the Ground. This is done with little trouble; for the Thatch is not laid on as ours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it tyed on by ſingle Leaves, as in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and many parts of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where they Thatch with <hi>Palmeto</hi> or Palm-tree Leaves: but this is made up in Panes of 7 or 8 foot ſquare, before it is laid on; ſo that 4 or 6 Panes, more or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bigneſs of the Houſe, will cover one ſide of it: and theſe Panes being only faſtned in a few places to the Rafters with Rattans, they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cut, and down drops half the covering at once. Theſe Panes are alſo better than looſe Thatch, as being more managable, in caſe any of them ſhould fall on or near the Oven where the Goods are, for they are eaſily dragg'd off to another

The neighbouring Houſes may this way be ſoon uncovered, before the Flame comes to 'em; and the Thatch either carried away, or at leaſt laid where it may burn by it ſelf. And for this purpoſe every Man is ordered to keep a long Pole or Bambo at his Door, with a Cutting-hook at the end of it, purpoſely for uncovering the Houſes: and if any Man is found without his Jar upon the Houſe, and his Bucket-Pole and long Hook at his Door, he will be puniſh'd ſeverely for his neglect. They are rigorous in exacting this: for even with all this caution they are much and often damaged by Fire.</p>
                  <p>The principal Streets in this City are very wide, tho' ſome are but narrow. They are moſt of them pav'd, or pitch'd rather, with ſmall Stones; but after a very ill manner. In the wet Seaſon they are very dirty; and in the dry time there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtagnant Ponds, and ſome Ditches full of black ſtinking Mud, in and about the City. This makes it unpleaſant, and a Man would think unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome too: yet it is healthy enough, as far as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, or could ever learn.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> who make this City their conſtant Reſidence, have two or three Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces in it, ſuch as they be. Two of them are very mean; they are built with Timber, yet have they many great Guns planted in Houſes near them, Stables for the Kings Elephants and Horſes, and pretty large ſquare ſpots of Ground for the Soldiers to draw themſelves up regularly before him. The Third Palace is called the Palace Royal. It is more magnificently built than the other two: yet built alſo with Timber, but all open as the Divans in <hi>Turky</hi> are ſaid to be. The Wall that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſeth it is moſt remarkable. It is ſaid to be 3 leagues in circumference. The heigth of this Wall is about 15 or 16 foot, and almoſt as many

It is faced up on both ſides with Brick: there are ſeveral ſmall Gates to go in and out at, but the main Gate faceth to the City. This they ſay is never opened, but when the <hi>Boua</hi> or Emperor goes in or comes out. There are two ſmaller Gates adjoyning to it, one on each ſide, which are opened on all occaſions, for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned there to paſs in and out; but Strangers are not permitted this liberty. Yet they may aſcend to the top of the Wall, and walk round it, there being Stairs at the Gate to go up by: and in ſome places the Walls are fallen down.</p>
                  <p>Within this Wall there are large Fiſh-ponds, where alſo there are Pleaſure-Boats for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's diverſion. I ſhall defer ſpeaking of him, whoſe Priſon this is, rather than Court, till the next Chapter, where I ſhall diſcourſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, who are very few, is pleaſantly ſeated on the North end of the City, fronting to the River. 'Tis a pretty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom low-built Houſe; the beſt that I ſaw in the City. There is a handſome Dining-room in the middle, and at each end convenient Apartments for the Merchants, Factors, and Servants belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Company to live in, with other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. This Houſe ſtands parallel with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and at each end of it there are ſmaller Houſes for other uſes, as Kitchin, Store-Houſes, &amp;c. run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a Line from the great Houſe towards the River, making two Wings, and a ſquare Court open to the River. In this ſquare ſpace, near the Banks of the River, there ſtands a Flag Staff, purpoſely for the hoyſing up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours on all occaſions: for it is the cuſtom of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen aboard, to let fly their Colours on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and all other remarkable Days.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing more in or about the City worth noting, but only a piece of Work on the ſame ſide, up the River. This is a maſſy Frame of Timber, ingeniouſly put together, and very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially placed on great Piles, that are ſet upright in the River, juſt by its Banks. The Piles are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven firmly into the Ground, cloſe one by another: and all the ſpace between them and the Bank is filled up with Stones, and on them great Trees laid a-croſs, and pinn'd faſt at each end to the Piles: ſo that the whole Fabrick muſt be moved before any part of it will yield. This piece of work is raiſed about 16 or 17 foot above the Water in the dry time: but in the wet Seaſon the Floods come within 2 or 3 foot of the top. It was made to reſiſt the violence of the Water in the rainy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for the Stream then preſſeth ſo hard againſt this place, that before this Pile was built, it broke down the Bank, and threatned to carry all before it, even to the ruining of the City, if this courſe had not timely been taken to prevent it. And ſo much the rather, becauſe there is a large Pond juſt within Land, and low Ground between it and the City: So that had it made but a ſmall breach into the Pond, it would have come even to the Skirts of the City. And tho' the City ſtands ſo high as that the Land-floods never reach it, yet the Land on which it ſtands being a ſort of yielding Sand, could not be thought capable of always reſiſting ſuch violence. For the natural Floods do very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make great changes in the River, breaking down

                  <p>But to return to the People. They are cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and civil to Strangers, eſpecially the trading People: But the great Men are Proud, Haughty and Ambitious; and the Soldiers very inſolent. The poorer ſort are very Thieviſh; inſomuch that the Factors and Strangers that traffick hither are forced to keep good Watch in the Night to ſecure their Goods, notwithſtanding the ſevere Puniſhments they have againſt Thieves. They have indeed great Opportunities of Thieving, the Houſes being ſo ſlightly built: But they will work a way under Ground, rather than fail; and uſe many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Stratagems. I am a Stranger to any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies uſed by them in Marriage, or at the Birth of a Child, or the like, if they uſe any: Polygamy is allowed of in this Country, and they buy their Wives of the Parents. The King and great Men keep ſeveral, as their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations lead them, and their Ability ſerves. The Poor are ſtinted for want of means more than deſire: For tho' many are not able to buy, much leſs to maintain one Wife; yet moſt of them make a ſhift to get one, for here are ſome very low prized ones, that are glad to take up with poor Huſbands. But then in hard times, the Man muſt ſell both Wife and Children, to buy Rice to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf. Yet this is not ſo common here as in ſome Places; as I before obſerved of the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> and <hi>Coromandel</hi> Coaſts. This cuſtom among them of buying Wives, eaſily degenerates into that other of hiring Miſſes, and gives great liberty to the young Women, who offer themſelves of then

There are of them of all prizes, from 100 Dollars to 5 Dollars, and the refuſe of all will be careſſed by the poor Seamen. Such as the <hi>Laſcars,</hi> who are <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> coming hither in Veſſels from <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> and other places; who yet have nothing to give them, but ſuch Fragments of Food, as their Commons will afford. Even the great Men of <hi>Tonquin</hi> will offer their Daughters to the Merchants and Officers, tho' their ſtay is not likely to be above 5 or 6 Months in the Country: neither are they affraid to be with Child by <hi>White</hi> Men, for thir Children will be much fairer than their Mothers, and conſequently of greater repute, when they grow up, if they be Girls. Nor is it any great charge to breed them here: and at the worſt, if their Mothers are not able to maintain them, 'tis but ſelling them when they are young. But to return, the Women who thus let themſelves to hire, if they have been ſo frugal as to ſave what they have got by theſe looſe Amours, they ſoon procure Huſbands, that will love and eſteem them well enough: and themſelves alſo will prove afterwards obedient and faithful Wives. For 'tis ſaid, that even while they are with Strangers, they are very faithful to them; eſpecially to ſuch as remain long in the Country, or make annual returns hither, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> generally do. Many of theſe have gotten good Eſtates by their <hi>Tonquin</hi> Ladies; and that chiefly by truſting them with Money and Goods. For in this poor Country 'tis a great advantage to watch the Market; and theſe female Merchants having ſtocks will mightily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, taking their opportunities of buying raw Silk in the dead time of the Year. With this they will employ the poor People, when work is ſcarce; and get it cheaper and better done, than when Ships are here: for then every man being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed

And by this means they will get their Goods ready againſt the Ships arrive, and before the ordinary working Seaſon, to the profit both of the Merchant and the <hi>Pagally.</hi>

                  <p>When a Man dies he is interr'd in his own Land, for here are no common Burying-places: And within a Month afterwards the Friends of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, eſpecially if he was the Maſter of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt make a great Feaſt of Fleſh and Fruit at the Grave. 'Tis a thing belonging to the Prieſts Office to aſſiſt at this ſolemnity; they are always there, and take care to ſee that the Friends of the deceaſed have it duly performed. To make this Feaſt they are obliged to ſell a piece of Land, tho' they have Money enough otherways: Which Money they beſtow in ſuch things as are neceſſary for the Solemnity, which is more or leſs, according to the quality of the deceaſed. If he was a great Man, there is a Tower of Wood erected over the Grave; it may be 7 or 8 Foot ſquare, and built 20 or 25 foot high. About 20 yards from the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are little Sheds built with Stalls, to lay the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on, both of Meat and Fruits of all ſorts, and that in great plenty. Thither the Country People reſort to fill their Bellies, for the Feaſt ſeems to be free for all Comers, at leaſt of the Neighbourhood. How it is dreſt or diſtributed about, I know not; but there the People wait till 'tis ready. Then the Prieſt gets within the Tower, and climbs up to the top, and looking out from thence, makes an Oration to the People below. After this the Prieſt deſcends, and then they ſet Fire to the Foundation of the Tower, burn it down to the Ground: and when this is done they fall to their Meat.

Theſe ſpend their time in gaming or ſporting, and you ſhall ſee the Streets full of People, both Citizens and Country Folks, gazing at ſeveral diverting Exerciſes. Some ſet up Swings in the Streets, and get Money of thoſe that will ſwing in them. The Frames are contrived like ours in the Fields about <hi>London</hi> in Holiday times: but they who ſwing ſtand upright in the lower part of the Swing, which is only a ſtick ſtanding on each end, being faſtned to a pendulous Rope, which they hold faſt with their hands on each ſide; and they raiſe themſelves to ſuch a prodigious heighth, that if the Swing ſhould break they muſt needs break their Limbs at beſt, if not kill themſelves outright. Others ſpend their time in drinking.

                  <p>The Betle Leaf is the great entertainment in the Eaſt for all Viſitants; and 'tis always given with the Arek ſolded up in it. They make up the Arek in pellets ſit for uſe, by firſt peeling off the outer green hard rind of the Nuts, and then ſplitting it length-ways in 3 or 4 parts, more or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its bigneſs.

In this Leaf thus ſpread with <hi>Chinam,</hi> they roll up a ſlice of <hi>Arek Nut,</hi> very neatly, and make a pellet of about an Inch long, and as big as the top of ones finger.

                  <p>It is accounted good breeding to commend the taſte or neatneſs of this preſent; and they all love to be flatter'd. You thereby extreamly pleaſe the Maſter of the Houſe, and ingage him to be your friend: and afterwards you may be ſure he will not fail to ſend his Servant with a preſent of Betle once in two or three mornings, with a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know how you do. This will coſt you a ſmall gratuity to the Servant, who joyfully acquaints his Maſter how gratefully you received the Preſent: and this ſtill engages him more; and he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement you with great reſpect whenever he meets you. I was invited to one of theſe New-years Feaſts by one of the Country, and accordingly went aſhore, as many other Seamen did upon like invitations. I know not what entertainment they had; but mine was like to be but mean, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſently left it. The ſtaple Diſh was Rice, which I have ſaid before is the common food: Beſides which, my friend, that he might the better entertain me and his others Gueſts, had been in the morning a fiſhing in a Pond not far from his houſe, and had caught a huge meſs of Frogs, and with great joy brought them home as ſoon as I came to his houſe. I wonder'd to ſee him turn out ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe creatures into a Baſket; and aſking him what they were for? he told me, to eat: but how he dreſt them I know not; I did not like his Dainties ſo well as to ſtay and dine with him.</p>
                  <p>The other great Feaſt they have, is after their <hi>May</hi>-crop is hous'd, about the beginning of <hi>June.</hi> At this Feaſt alſo they have publick Rejoycing; but much inferiour to thoſe of their New-years Feaſt.</p>

For they believe the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul: but the notion that they have of the Deity is very obſcure. Yet by the Figures which they make repreſenting this God, they manifeſtly ſhew that they do believe him to excel in ſight, ſtrength, courage and wiſdom, juſtice, &amp;c. For tho' their Idols, which are made in human ſhapes, are very different in their forms; yet they all repreſent ſomewhat extraordinary, either in the countenance, or in the make of the body or limbs. Some are very corpulent and fat, others are very lean, ſome alſo have many eyes, others as many hands, and all graſping ſomewhat. Their aſpects are alſo different, and in ſome meaſure repreſenting what they are made to imitate, or there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in their hands or lying by them, to illuſtrate the meaning of the Figure. Several paſſions are alſo repreſented in the countenance of the Image, as love, hatred, joy, grief. I was told of one Image that was placed ſitting on his Hams, with his Elbows reſting on his knees, and his Chin reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his 2 Thumbs, for the ſupporting his Head, which lookt drooping forwards: his Eyes were mournfully lifted up towards Heaven, and the figure was ſo lean, and the countenance and whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure was ſo ſorrowful, that it was enough to move the beholder with pity and compaſſion.

                  <p>I think the <hi>Mandarins</hi> and rich people ſeldom come to the <hi>Pagodas,</hi> but have a Clerk of their own, who reads the Petition in their own Courts or Yards: and it ſhould ſeem by this, that the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi> have a better ſenſe of the Deity, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People; for in theſe Yards, there is no Idol, before whom to perform the Ceremony, but 'tis done with Eyes lift up to Heaven. When they make this Petition they order a great deal of good meat to be dreſt, and calling all their Servants into the Court, where the Ceremony is to be perſormed, they place the food on a Table, where alſo 2 Incenſe-pots are placed, and then the <hi>Mandarin</hi> preſents a paper to the Clerk, who reads it with an audible voice. In the firſt place there is drawn up an ample account of all that God has bleſt him withal, as Health, Riches, Honour, Favour of his Prince, &amp;c. and long Life, if he be old; and towards the concluſion, there is a Petition to God for a continuance of all theſe bleſſings, and a farther augmentation of them; eſpecially with long life and favour of his Prince, which laſt they eſteem as the greateſt of all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. While this paper is reading the Maſter kneels down, and bows his face down to the Earth: and when the Clerk has done reading it, he puts it to the burning ruſhes, that are in the Incenſe-pot, where 'tis conſum'd.

                  <p>The <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> Language is ſpoken very much through the throat, but many words of it are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced through the teeth.

                  <p>They have Schools of Learning and Nurſeries to tutor youth.

                  <p>The Work-houſes where the Lacker is laid on, are accounted very unwholeſome, by reaſon of a poiſonous quality, ſaid to be in the Lack, which fumes into the Brains through the Noſtrils of thoſe that work at it, making them break out in Botches and Biles; yet the ſcent is not ſtrong, nor the ſmell unſavoury. The Labourers at this Trade can work only in the dry Seaſon, or when the drying North Winds blow: for as they lay ſeveral Coats of Lack, one on another, ſo theſe muſt all have time to be throughly dry, before an outer Coat can be laid on the former. It grows blackiſh of it ſelf, when expoſed to the Air; but the Colour is heightned by Oil and other ingredients mixt with it. When the outſide Coat is dry, they poliſh it to bring it to a gloſs. This is done chiefly by often rubbing it with the ball or palm of their Hands. They can make the Lack of any colour, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it ſo as to make therewith good Glew, ſaid to be the beſt in the World: It is alſo very cheap, and prohibited Exportation.

The King buys great Guns, and ſome pieces of Broad-cloath: but his pay is ſo bad, that Merchants care not to deal with him, could they avoid it.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> Religion, and Cuſtoms. Theſe 2 Kings they have at preſent, are not any way related in their Deſcent or Families: nor could I learn how long their Government has continued in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent form; but it appears to have been for ſome Succeſſions. The occaſion is variouſly reported; but ſome give this account of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Boua</hi>'s, or antient Kings of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> were formerly Maſters of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> and kept that Nation in ſubjection by an Army of <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept there, under a General or Deputy, who rul'd them. When <hi>Cochinchina</hi> threw off the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> Yoak, the King had two great Generals, one in <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> and another in <hi>Tonquin</hi> it ſelf. Theſe two Generals differing, he who was in <hi>Cochinchina</hi> revolted from his Soveraign of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> and by his Power over the Army there, made himſelf King of <hi>Cochinchina:</hi> ſince which theſe two Nations have always been at Wars; yet each Nation of late is rather on the defenſive part than on the offenſive. But when the General who commanded in <hi>Cochinchina</hi> had been thus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in his Revolt from under the <hi>Boua,</hi> the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> General took the Courage to do ſo too; and having gained the Affections of his Army, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the King, his Maſter, of all the Regal Power, and kept it with all the Revenues of the Crown in his own Hands: yet leaving the other the Title of King; probably, becauſe of the great zeal the People had for that Family. And thus the Kingdom came wholly into the Power of this <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> General, and his Heirs, who carry the Title of <hi>Choua;</hi> the <hi>Boua's</hi> of the Ancient Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly having only the ſhadow of that Authority they were formerly Maſters of. The <hi>Boua</hi> lives the Life of a kind of a Priſoner of State, within the old Palace, with his Women and Children; and diverts himſelf in Boats among his Fiſh-ponds

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> within the Palace Walls, but never ſtirs without thoſe bounds. He is held in great Veneration by all the <hi>Tonquineſe,</hi> and ſeemingly by the <hi>Choua</hi> alſo; who never offers any violence to him, but treats him with all imaginable reſpect. The People ſay they have no King but <hi>Boua;</hi> and ſeem to have ſad apprehenſions of the loſs they ſhould have, if he ſhould dye without an Heir: and whenever the <hi>Choua</hi> comes into his prefence, which is 2 or 3 times in the year, he uſeth abundance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to him, and tells him, that his very Life is at his ſervice, and that he governs and rules wholly to do him a kindneſs: and always gives him the upper hand. So alſo when any Ambaſſadors are ſent from the Emperor of <hi>China,</hi> they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their Meſſage to none but the <hi>Boua,</hi> and have their Audience of him. Yet after all this Pageantry, the <hi>Boua</hi> has only a few Servants to attend him, none of the <hi>Mandarins</hi> make their Court to him, nor is he allow'd any Guards: All the Magiſtracy and Soldiery, Treaſure, and the ordering of all Matters of Peace or War, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at the <hi>Choua</hi>'s diſpoſal; all preferment is from him, and the very Servants who attend the <hi>Boua,</hi> are ſuch only as the <hi>Choua</hi> places about him. Beſides theſe Servants, none are ever ſuffer'd to ſee the <hi>Boua,</hi> much leſs Strangers: So that I could learn nothing as to his Perſon. But as to the <hi>Choua,</hi> I have been informed that he is an angry, ill-natured, leprous Perſon. He lives in the ſecond Palace, where he has ten or twelve Wives; but what Children I know not. He governs with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Authority over the Subjects, and with great tyranny: for their Lives, Goods, and Eſtates are at his Command.

This Treaſure is buried in great Ciſterns full of Water, made purpoſely for that uſe: and to ſecure it, he keeps a great many Soldiers there; and commits the charge, both of them and the Treaſure, to the Governour of the Province, who is one of his principal Eunuchs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Choua</hi> has always a ſtrong guard of Soldiers about his Palace, and many large Stables for his Horſes and Elephants. The Horſes are about 13 or 14 hands high, and are kept very fat: there are 2 or 300 of them. The Elephants are kept in long Stables by themſelves, each having a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar room or partition, with a Keeper to dreſs and feed him. The number of the King's Elephants are about 150 or 200. They are watered and waſhed every day in the River.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Elephants are very gentle and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable, others are more indocil and unruly. When theſe rude ones are to paſs through the Streets, tho' only to be watered, the Rider or Dreſſer orders a Gong or Drum to be beaten before him, to warn People that an unruly Elephant is coming; and they preſently clear the Streets and give a paſſage for the Beaſt; who will do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to any that are in the way, and their Riders or Keepers cannot reſtrain him.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Choua</hi>'s Palace, there is a large parade, or ſquare place for the Soldiers to be drawn up. On one ſide there is a place for the <hi>Mandarins</hi> to ſit, and ſee the Soldiers exerciſe, on the other ſide there is a ſhed, wherein all the Cannon and heavy Guns are lodged. There may be 50 or 60 Iron Guns from Falcon to Demy-Culverin, 2 or 3 whole Culverin or Demi-Cannon, and ſome old Iron Mortars lying on logs. The Guns are mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Carriages, but the Carriages of theſe Guns are old and very ill made. There is one

It is of a taper bore; of a foot diameter at the mouth, but much ſmaller at the britch. It is an ill ſhaped thing, yet much eſteemed by them, probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was caſt here, and the biggeſt that ever they made. It was caſt about 12 or 13 years ago, and it being ſo heavy, they cou'd not contrive to mount it, but were beholding to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to put it into the Carriage; where it now ſtands more for a ſhow them ſervice. But tho this is but an ordinary piece of workmanſhip, yet the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> underſtand how to run Metals, and are very expert in temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth, wherewith they make their mould.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all the great Guns, that I ſaw or heard of in this Kingdom, neither are here any Forts, yet the King keeps always a great many Solders. 'Tis ſaid that he has always 70 or 80000 conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in pay. Theſe are moſt Foot, they are arm'd with <hi>Curtans</hi> or Sword, and Hand-Guns of 3 foot and an half or 4 foot in the Barrel. The bore is about the bigneſs of our Horſe Piſtols, they are all Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, and they are very thick and heavy. The Soldiers do all make their own Powder. They have little Engins for mixing the ingredients, and make as ſmall a quantity as they pleaſe. They know not how to corn it, and therefore it is in unequal lumps, ſome as big as the top of a mans Thumb, and ſome no bigger than a white Pea: neither have I ſeen any Powder well corn'd, that has been made in any of theſe Eaſtern Nations.</p>
                  <p>The Soldiers have each a Cartage Box covered with leather, after the manner of the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Privateers: but inſtead of Paper Cartages, theſe are filled with ſmall hollow Canes, each containing a load or charge of Powder; which they empty out of the Cane into the Gun; ſo that each Box has in it, as it were, ſo many Bandeleers. Their Arms are kept

When they march alſo in rainy weather, they have another Bambo, to cover their Guns. This is large enough to cover the whole Barrel, and very well lacker'd; ſo that it is not only handſome, but alſo preſerves the Gun dry.</p>
                  <p>The Soldiers when they march are led by an Officer, who is leader of the File: and every File conſiſts of 10 men: but as I have been informed by one who has ſeen them march, they don't keep their ranks in marching. The Soldiers are moſt of them luſty ſtrong well made men: for 'tis that chiefly recommends them to the Kings ſervice. They muſt alſo have good Stomachs, for that is a greater recommendation than the former; neither can any ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For which reaſon, when a Soldier comes to be liſted, his Stomach is firſt proved with Rice, the common ſubſiſtence of the ordinary People in this Kingdom: and according as he acquits himſelf in this firſt tryal of his manhood, ſo he is either diſcharged or entertain'd in the ſervice. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that at theſe Tryals they commonly eat 8 or 9 cups of Rice, each containing a pint, and they are ever afterwards eſteem'd and advanced, according to the firſt days ſervice: and the greateſt eaters are chiefly imploy'd as guards to the King, and commonly attend on his perſon. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Ngean</hi> breeds the luſtieſt men, and the beſt eaters: for that reaſon thoſe of that Province are generally imploy'd as Soldiers. After 30 years ſervice a Soldier may petition to be disbanded; and then the Village where he was born muſt ſend another Man to ſerve in his room.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> The Horſemen are but few, and armed with Bows, and long Spears or Lances, like the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks.</hi> Both theſe and the Foot Soldiers are very dexterous in uſing their weapons, and ſhoot very well either with Gun or Bow; for they are often exerciſed by ſhooting at Marks. The King orders a ſhooting match once a year, and rewards the beſt marks-man with a fine Coat, or about 1000 <hi>Caſh,</hi> as 'tis called, which is a ſumm above the value of a Dollar. The mark is a white earthen Cup, placed againſt a Bank. The diſtance they ſtand to fire at it is about 80 yards. He who breaks the firſt Cup has the fineſt Coat; for there are others alſo of leſs worth and finery for the reſt, that have the good fortune to break the other Cups, or <hi>Caſh</hi> in lieu of them. This is all at the Kings charge, who incourages this exerciſe very much, as a means to make them good Marks-men; and they generally prove ſuch. They will load and fire the quickeſt of any People. They draw the Rammer at one motion, and powring down the Powder and Bullet, they ram all down at one motion more. Then they withdraw the Rammer, and put it into its place, at 2 motions more. All the 4 motions are performed very dexterouſly and quick: and when they ſhoot at a mark, they level, and fire at firſt ſight, yet very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the King of <hi>Tonquin</hi> has no Forts, yet he keeps always a great many Soldiers in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Towns of his Kingdom; eſpecially on the S. W. part thereof, to check the <hi>Cochinchineſe,</hi> his implacable Enemies: and tho' there ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a pitch'd Battel between them, yet there are often Skirmiſhings, which keep the Soldiers on each ſide upon thier guards: and ſometimes there are conſiderable excurſions made by one or other party into the Enemies Territories, where they

The King alſo has always about 30000 near his perſon, and quarter'd in or about <hi>Cachao,</hi> ready on all occaſions. The dry ſeaſon is the time for his Armies to take the Field, or go againſt an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: for in theſe Countries there is no marching in the Wet ſeaſon. When he ſends an Army by Land on any expedition, the General, and other great Officers are mounted on Elephants. Theſe have neat little boarded Houſes or Caſtles faſtned on their backs, where the great men ſit in ſtate, ſecur'd from the Sun or Rain. They have no Field-pieces in their Armies, but inſtead thereof they carry on mens backs Guns that will carry a four ounce Shot. The barrels of theſe Guns are about 6 or 7 foot long: but tho' one man carries one of them on his back, yet he cannot hold it out to fire, like ſmall Guns, but reſts it on its Carriage, which is another Man's burden, and they two manage it between them. The Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is only a round piece of Wood, about 4 inches thick, and 6 or 7 foot long. One end of the Carriage is ſupported with two Legs, or a Fork of three foot high, the other reſts on the ground. The Gun is placed on the top, where there is an Iron Socket for the Gun to reſt in, and a Swivel to turn the Muzzel any way. From the britch of the Gun there is a ſhort ſtock, for the man who fires the Gun to traverſe it withal, and to reſt it againſt his ſhoulder. The uſe of theſe Guns is to clear a Paſs, or to fire over the Rivers, when the Enemy is ſo commodiouſly plac'd, that there is no other way to move him; and they are carry'd by theſe two men almoſt with as much eaſe as Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. In theſe Land-expeditions they carry but little Baggage, beſides their neceſſary Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and Provender: ſo that if they are routed they lightly ſcamper away; and generally

They alſo look after the Cuſtome, and ſee that all goods have paid, before they may paſs further. All Travellers are alſo ſearch'd by them, and ſtrictly examined; and if any perſons are taken only on ſuſpicion, they are uſed very ſeverely, till they can clear themſelves: ſo that no diſaffected or rebellious perſon can ſtir, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being preſently known; and this renders the King very ſafe in his Government.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Naval-force conſiſts only in a ſort of flat bottom Gallies, and theſe ſeemingly deſigned more for State than ſervice, except to tranſport Soldiers from one place to another. Theſe Veſſels are 50, 60, or 70 foot long, and about 10 or 12 foot broad in the waſte; and the 2 ends near as many foot high out of the water, eſpecially the hinderpart or Stern: but the waſte or middle of the Veſſel is not above 2 foot and an half from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that being the place, by which all the men go in and out. from thence towards each end, it is gently and very artificially raiſed, to a conſiderable heighth, ſo that the whole fabrick appears very graceful and pleaſant, as it moves on the water. The head or forepart is not altogether ſo high as the Stern, neither is there ſo much coſt beſtowed on it for ornament: for tho' it wants neither carv'd work or painting, yet 'tis not comparable to that of the Stern, which has great variety of carving and is curiouſly lacker'd and gilded.

They are beſt in the broad Rivers near the Sea, where they may take the advantage of the Tides to help them: for tho' they row pretty ſwift when they are light, yet when they have 60, 80, or 100 men aboard, as ſometimes they have, they are heavy and row ſlowly againſt the ſtream. Nevertheleſs when there is occaſion they muſt go againſt the ſtream a great way, tho' they perform it with great labour.</p>
                  <p>The Soldiers in theſe Veſſels are equipt with Bows, Swords, and Lances, and when many of them are ſent on any expedition, they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Squadrons. They are diſtinguiſhed by their ſeveral Flags of different colours; as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an expedition they made up the River, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of their Northern Neighbours, while we were there. There were then about 60 of theſe Galleys ſent out up the River; and they had from 16 to 40 Soldiers in each, all well armed. Their General was called <hi>Ungee Comei,</hi> who was a great <hi>Mandarin,</hi> and was the perſon appointed by the King to inſpect into our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traffick; being made director or protector of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, who uſed to ſpeak of him as a generous man. There were two more great Officers under him, each in a Veſſel by himſelf. Theſe three had Flags of diſtinction: the firſt was yellow, the ſecond blue, the third red or green. They went away from <hi>Cachao</hi> towards the Mountains, but did not return while we were there: but ſince we came from thence, I have been informed that the expedition prov'd fruitleſs, and that the General <hi>Ungee Comei</hi> was much diſgraced.</p>

Theſe Galley-Houſes are 50 or 60 paces from the River ſide; and when they bring the Galleys into them, there is a ſtrong Rope brought round the ſtern of the Veſſel, and both ends ſtretched along, one on each ſide: then 3 or 400 Men, ſtanding ready with the Rope in their Hands, wait for the ſignal; which being given by the beat of a Gong, they begin to draw withal their ſtrength; and making a great ſhrieking noiſe; they run her up in a trice into her place. This alſo is their Soldiers work, who having thus Houſed all their Galleys, return to their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Soldiers are employed alſo in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Watch and Ward, for the ſecurity of private Men, as well as in the King's buſineſs: and the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> are obſerv'd to keep good orders in the Night in all Towns and Villages; but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the great Cities, and eſpecially at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chao.</hi> There every Street is guarded with a ſtrong Watch, as well to keep ſilence, as to hinder any diſorder.

There is alſo a Rope ſtretched croſs the Street breaſt high, and no Man may paſs this place, till he is examin'd, unleſs he will venture to be ſoundly bang'd by the Watch. Theſe Men can handle their Weapon ſo well, that if they deſign miſchief, they will dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly break a Leg or Thigh-bone, that being the place which they commonly ſtrike at.

Theſe Watch-men are Soldiers, but belong to the Governor or ſome other Men of great Power, who will hear no Complaints againſt them, tho' never ſo juſtly made: and therefore they often put Men in the Stocks at their pleaſure, and in the Morning carry them before a Magiſtrate: who commonly fines the Priſoners to pay ſomewhat; and be it more or leſs, it falls part to the Magiſtrate. Neither dares any Man complain of injuſtice upon ſuch uſage, in this caſe eſpecially; tho' his cauſe be never ſo juſt: and therefore patience is in this Country as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for poor People, as in any part of the World.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding theſe Abuſes, they have one Cuſtom in the Adminiſtring Juſtice, that is pleaſing enough. For if a difference or quarrel at any time happens between 2 mean Men, and they are not to be reconciled without going before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, he uſually conſidering their Poverty, lays no heavy mulct on the Offender, but injoins him this as his penalty, that he ſhall treat the injur'd Perſon with a Jarr of Arack, and a Fowl, or a ſmall Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that ſo feaſting together, they may both drown all animoſity in good Liquor, and renew their Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>But if it be a Controverſy about a Debt, they take a very different Method. For the Debtors are many times order'd to be Priſoners in their Creditors houſes, where they are beaten, or kept with a log of Wood made faſt to their Legs, to hinder them from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away. Theſe poor Priſoners eat nothing but Rice and drink Water, and are tyranically inſulted over by their rigid Creditors, till the Debt is ſatisfied. Their Corporal Puniſhments upon Malefactors, and ſome times upon others are very ſevere. Some an loaden with Iron Chains faſtned to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>There is another ſort of puniſhing Inſtrument not unlike this, called a <hi>Gongo.</hi> This alſo is made to wear about the Neck, but is ſhaped like a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The ſides of it are 2 large Bamboes, of about 10 or 12 foot long, with ſeveral ſuch rounds or ſticks as Ladders have to keep the ſides aſunder; but much ſhorter: for the 2 ſide Bamboes are no farther aſunder, than to admit of a narrow room for the Neck; and the 2 rounds in the middle are much at the ſame diſtance from each other, on each ſide the Neck, forming a little Square: thro' which the Man looks as if he were carrying a Ladder on his Shoulders, with his Head thro' the rounds. If either of theſe Yokes were to be taken off in a ſhort time, as in 6, 9, or 12 hours, it would be no great matter: but to wear one of them a Month, 2, 3, or longer, as I have been informed they ſometimes do, ſeems to be a very ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet 'tis ſome comfort to ſome, that they have the Liberty to walk abroad where they will: but others are both yoak'd and impriſon'd: and the Priſoners in publick Priſons are uſed worſe than a Man would uſe a Dog, they being half ſtarved and ſoundly beaten to boot.</p>
                  <p>They have a particular puniſhment for ſuch as are ſuſpected to fire Houſes, or who are thought to have occaſioned the Fire through their neglect. The Maſter of the Houſe, where the Fire firſt breaks out, will hardly clear himſelf from ſuſpicion, and the ſeverity of the Law. The puniſhment in this caſe is to ſit in a Chair of 12 or 14 foot high, bare-headed, 3 whole days ſucceſſively in the hot ſcorching Sun: this Chair is ſet, for his greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, before the place where his Houſe ſtood.</p>

The Criminal is laid flat on his Belly on the Ground, with his Britches pluckt down over his Hams: in which poſture a luſty Fellow bangs his bare Britch with a ſplit Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, about 4 fingers broad, and 5 foot long. The number of his Blows are more or leſs; according to the nature of the Crime, or the pleaſure of the Magiſtrate; yet Money will buy favour of the Executioner, who knows how to moderate his ſtrokes for a Fee before-hand. Otherwiſe his blows uſually fall ſo heavy that the poor Offender may be lamed a Month or two. After a Man has ſuffered any of theſe puniſhments, he can never obtain any publick favour or employment.</p>
                  <p>They have no Courts of Judicature, but any ſingle Magiſtrate iſſues out his Warrants for the apprehending of Malefactors, and upon taking them immediately tries them: and as the Sentence is final, and without appeal, ſo 'tis no ſooner paſt, but 'tis executed alſo without more ado. Their puniſhment in capital crimes is uſually beheading. The Criminal is carried immediately from the Magiſtrates Houſe to his own: for there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of Execution, but the Malefactor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers near his own Houſe, or where the fact was committed. There he is placed ſitting on the Ground, with his Body upright, and his Legs ſtretched out: and the Executioner being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a large <hi>Curtane</hi> or Backſword, and ſtriking a full back blow on the Neck, at one ſtroke he ſevers the Head from the Body; the Head com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tumbling down into the owners lap, and the Trunk falling backward on the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Theft is not thought worthy of Death, but is puniſhed with cutting off ſome Member, or part of a Member, according to the degree of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For ſometimes only one joynt of a Finger

                  <p>The Magiſtrates and other great Men of this Kingdom are called <hi>Mandarins.</hi> Moſt of them in Office about the King are Eunuchs, and not only gelded, but alſo their Members cut quite off quite flat to their Bellies. Theſe, as I have been informed, are all very learned Men after their way, eſpecially in the Laws of the Country. They riſe gradually by their merit or favour, from one degree to another, as well they who are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Civil as in Military Affairs: And ſcarce place of truſt or profit goes beſide them. No Man is permitted to walk familiarly about the King's Palace without the leave of the Eunuch <hi>Mandarins;</hi> and for this Reaſon having ſuch free acceſs to the King themſelves, and excluding whom they will, they engroſs his favour. This is taken ſo much to Heart by ſome, that through envy and diſcontent, they often pine away, as is commonly ſaid, even to Death: And I heard of ſuch an one, who was called <hi>Ungee Thuan Ding: Ungee</hi> ſeems a Title of Honour among them.

'Tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they firſt put the Patient into a Sleep: But how long they are curing hm after the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is over, I know not.

This is done with great Ceremony: they cut the Throat of a Hen, and let the Blood fall into a Baſon of Arack. Of this Arack every Man has a ſmall draught given him to drink, after he has publickly declared his ſincerity and readineſs to ſerve his Prince. 'Tis eſteemed the ſolemneſt tye by which any Man can ingage himſelf. This way of giving ſolemn potions to drink, is uſed alſo in other Countries, on different occaſions. As particularly on the <hi>Gold Coaſt</hi> of <hi>Guinea;</hi> where when Men or Women are taxed for a Crime, be it of what Nature it will, but eſpecially Adultery, and the matter cannot be proved by Evidence, the <hi>Fetiſſero</hi> or Prieſt, decides the difference, by giving a Potion of bitter Water, to the Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: which if they refuſe to take, they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be guilty without farther proof: but if they drink it off, the event is ſaid to be, that if the Perſons be guilty, this Water immediately ſwells their bodies till they burſt; but if innocent, they are not hurt thereby. What tricks the <hi>Fetiſſero's</hi> may play in compounding this Water, I know not: but this kind of Tryal is frequent among them, and ſeems to be a remainder of the old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tryal by the Waters of jealouſy, ſpoken of in the 5th.

This potion is called Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and 'tis given by way of Trial upon any light ſuſpicion even of a ſmall injury.

                  <p>In their entertainments, and at their ordinary eating, inſtead of Forks and Spoons, they uſe two ſmall round ſticks about the length and bigneſs of a Tobacco Pipe. They hold them both in the right Hand, one between the fore Finger and Thumb; the other between the middle Finger and the fore Finger, as our Boys do their Snappers. They uſe them very dextrouſly, taking up the ſmalleſt grain of Rice with them; nor is it account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mannerly to touch the Food after it is dreſt, with their Hands: And tho' it be difficult for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to uſe them, being unaccuſtom'd to them, yet a little uſe will overcome that difficulty; and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that reſide here ought to learn this, as well as other cuſtoms of the Country, that are Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that ſo their Company may be more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

Nothing will ingage them more than to petition them on this account; and the Perſon thus ſolicited will not fail to procure a young Damſel for his Friend, be it but for a night or two, or for 4 or 5 Months.

At this time Captain <hi>Weldon</hi>'s <hi>Dutch</hi> Pilot, the chief Man whom he ſent in his Bark, was aboard Mr. <hi>Ludford</hi>'s: and when the ſuppoſed Pirates came up, Mr. <hi>Ludford</hi> and he made the Seamen row the Bark to meet them, and in a ſhort time got ſo near, that they fired at them. Theſe Men not expecting to have met ſuch a reception, for the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> have no Guns, but in the King's Gallies, thought to ſave themſelves by Flight: but were ſo eagerly purſued by Mr. <hi>Ludford,</hi> that at laſt they yielded to his Mercy, after they had loſt one Man in Fight. He, joyful of this ſucceſs, ſecured the Priſoners, and made the beſt of his courſe to the next Town on the Coaſt in his way; there deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Priſoners to the Magiſtrates, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a full relation of the Action.

When Mr. <hi>Ludford</hi> ſaw how hard it was like to go with him, he thought to clear himſelf, or leſſen his fine, by bringing Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Weldon</hi> into the ſnare; ſaying that he had no Guns in his Bark, but made uſe of Captain <hi>Weldon</hi>'s, and that Captain <hi>Weldon</hi>'s Pilot was aboard his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and aſſiſted in the Action. But neither did this help him: for upon trying the matter at <hi>Cachao,</hi> whither 'twas carried by Appeal, Captain <hi>Weldon</hi>'s Commiſſion ſaved him: ſo that Mr. <hi>Ludford</hi> was forced to pay the Money, which was more than he got by the Voyage. This might be a warning to him, how he meddled with <hi>Tonquin</hi> Pirates again; for it was not enough for him to plead that they came with an intent to rob him. Indeed if he had been robb'd, he might have been pitied by the Magiſtrates on complaint of his misfortune: but yet it is very probable, that if he ſhould have taken them in the very fact, poſſeſt of his Goods, theſe Vermin, would have had one hole or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to creep out at; ſo corrupt are the great Men of this Kingdom. And indeed 'tis not improbable that theſe Fellows were Fiſhermen, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buſineſs: For there is good Fiſhing in all the Bay of <hi>Tonquin</hi> clear round it, and there are many Boats that go out a fiſhing, and the Fiſhermen are generally very honeſt and harmleſs Men; except now and then, they attempt to make a prize of ſome poor Veſſel they meet, and can overcome by their numbers without fighting; for ſuch an one they board, and ſtrip all the Men naked even to there Skin. Among theſe Iſlands alſo, by report, their are plenty of Pearl Oyſters, that have good Pearls in them; but the Seamen are diſcouraged from fiſhing for them by the King, for he ſeizeth on all he finds.

Soon after this I went a ſecond time up to <hi>Cachao,</hi> not in a Boat as before, but on Foot along the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being deſirous to ſee as much of it as I could: and I hired a <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> for about a Dollar to be my Guide. This, tho' but a ſmall matter, was a great deal out of my Pocket, who had not above 2 Dollars in all, which I had gotten on board, by teaching ſome of our young Seamen Plain Sailing.</p>
                  <p>This was all I had to bear my own charges and my Guides; and 'twas the worſe with me, becauſe I was forced to make ſhort Journeys every Day by Reaſon of my Weakneſs: It was about the latter end of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1688, when we ſet out. We kept on the Eaſt-ſide of the River, where we found the Roads pretty dry, yet in ſome places dirty enough. We ferry'd over ſeveral Creeks and Brooks running into the great River, whese are Ferry Boats always plying, which have a few Caſh for their fare. The Feaver and Ague which I brought with me from <hi>Achin</hi> was gone: yet the Fruits I eat here, eſpecially the ſmall Oranges, brought me into a Flux. However tho' I was but weak, yet I was not diſcouraged from this Journey, being weary of lying ſtill, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of ſeeing ſomewhat that might further gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify my curioſity.</p>
                  <p>We found no Houſes of Entertainment on the Road, yet at every Village we came we got Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, and a Barbacue of ſplit Bambooes to ſleep on. The People were very civil, lending us an earthen Pot to dreſs Rice, or any thing elſe. Uſually after Supper, if the Day was not ſhut in, I took a ramble about the Village, to ſee what was worth taking notice of, eſpecially the <hi>Pagoda</hi> of

Theſe had the Image of either an Horſe, an Elephant, or both, ſtanding with the Head looking out of the Doors: The <hi>Pagodas</hi> themſelves were but ſmall and low. I ſtill made it dark Night before I returned to my Lodging, and then I laid me down to ſleep. My Guide carried my Sea-Gown, which was my covering in the night, and my Pillow was a Log of Wood: but I ſlept very well, tho' the weakneſs of my Body did now require better accommodation.</p>
                  <p>The third day after my ſetting out, about 3 a Clock in the afternoon, I ſaw before me a ſmall Tower; ſuch as I mentioned before, as erected for a time in honour of ſome great Perſon deceaſed. But I knew not then the meaning of it, for I had not ſeen the like before in the Country. As I came nearer to it, I ſaw a Multitude of People, moſt of them Men and Boys; and coming nearer ſtill, I ſaw a great deal of Meat on the Stalls, that were plac'd at a ſmall diſtance from the Tower. This made me conclude that it was ſome great Market, and that the Fleſh I ſaw was for ſale: Therefore I went in among the Croud, as well to ſee the Tower as to buy ſome of the Meat for my Supper, it being now between 4 and 5 a Clock in the Afternoon. My Guide could not ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> neither could I ſpeak the <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: So I aſkt him no queſtions about it; and he too went readily in with me; it may be not knowing my intent was to buy. Firſt I went round the Tower and viewed it: It was four-ſquare, each ſide about 8 foot broad: at the Ground the heighth of it was about 26 foot, but at the top ſomewhat narrower than at the bottom. I ſaw no door to enter into it: it ſeemed to be very ſlightly built, at leaſt covered with thin boards, which were all joyned cloſe together, and painted of a dark red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour. I then went on to the Stalls, which

I paſt by abundance of Oranges packt up in Baſkets, which I think were the faireſt I ever ſaw, and for quantity more than I had ſeen gathered all the time I was at <hi>Tonquin.</hi> I paſt by theſe, and ſeeing no other Fruit, I came to the Fleſh-Stalls, where was nothing but Pork, and this alſo was all cut into quarters and ſides of Pork: I thought there might be 50 or 60 Hogs cut up thus, and all ſeemed to be very good Meat. When I ſaw that there was none of it in ſmall pieces, fit for my uſe, I, as was cuſtomary in the Markets, took hold of a quarter, and made ſigns to the Maſter of it, as I thought, to cut me a piece of 2 or 3 Pound. I was ignorant of any ceremony they were about, but the ſuperſtitious People ſoon made me ſenſible of my errour: For they aſſaulted me on all ſides, buffeting me and renting my Cloaths, and one of them ſnatched away my Hat. My Guide did all he could to appeaſe them, and dragg'd me out of the Crowd: Yet ſome ſurly Fellows followed us, and ſeemed by their Countenance and Geſtures to threaten me; but my Guide at laſt pacify'd them and fetched my Hat, and we marched away as faſt as we could. I could not be informed of my Guide what this meant; but ſometime after, when I was return'd to our Ship, the Guide's Brother, who ſpoke <hi>Engliſh,</hi> told me, it was a Funeral Feaſt, and that the Tower was the Tomb which was to be burned; and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men who lived there told me the ſame. This was the only Funeral Feaſt that ever I was at among them, and they gave me cauſe to remember it: but this was the worſt uſage I received from any of them all the time that I was in the Country. When I was out of this trouble, my Guide and I marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> I was both weary and hungry, and I think my appetite was raiſed by ſeeing ſo much Food: For indeed at firſt ſight of it I concluded to have had a good Supper; but now I was likely to ſup only on Rice, or a Yam roaſted, and two Eggs, as I us'd to do. For tho' there were Fowls to be bought at every Houſe where I lay, yet my Pocket would not reach them; and for other Fleſh, there was none to be had, unleſs my way had lain thro' the Town when it was Market day with them.</p>
                  <p>Two Days after this I got with much ado to <hi>Hean,</hi> for my Flux encreaſed, and my ſtrength decreaſed.

The Biſhop's Palace is a pretty neat low Houſe, ſtanding at the North end of the Town, by the ſide of the River. 'Tis encompaſſed with a pretty high Wall, and has a large Gate to enter at. The Gate ſtands fronting to the Street, and runs up with Houſes on both ſides, and ends at the Palace. Within the Wall there is a ſmall Yard, that goes round the Palace; and at the farther end of the Yard there are ſmall lodging-rooms for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and other neceſſary Offices. The Houſe it ſelf is not very large nor high; it ſtands not in the middle of the Yard, but rather neareſt the Gate, which Gate is open all day, but ſhut in the Night. That part that fronts the Gate, has a pretty neat Room, which ſeems to be deſigned for the reception of Strangers: for it has no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with any other Room in the Houſe, tho' joyned to it as one building: the Door by which you enter it, fronts to the Gate, and this Dooor alſo ſtands open all the day.</p>

At the Door thereof, I found a ſmall Line hanging down, which I pull'd; and a Bell ringing within, gave notice of my being there: yet no Body appearing preſently, I went in and ſate down. There was a Table in the middle of the Room, and handſome Chairs, and ſeveral <hi>European</hi> Pictures hung upon the Walls.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before one of the Prieſts came into the Room to me, and received me very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy. With him I had a great deal of Diſcourſe: He was a <hi>French</hi> Man by Nation, but ſpoke <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> very well. It was chiefly in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> that we entertained each other, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood much better than I could ſpeak: yet I aſk'd him Queſtions, and made a ſhift to anſwer him to ſuch Queſtions as he aſked me; and when I was at a loſs in my <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> I had recourſe to <hi>Latin,</hi> having ſtill ſome ſmatterings of what I learnt of it at School in my youth. He was very free to talk with me, and firſt aſked me my buſineſs thither? I told him that my buſineſs was to <hi>Cachao,</hi> where I had been once before: that then I went by Water, but now I was moved by my curioſity to travel by Land, and that I could not paſs by any <hi>Europeans</hi> without a Viſit, eſpecially ſuch a famous place as this. He aſked me many other Queſtions, and particularly if I was a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick? I told him no, but falling then into a Diſcourſe about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he told me what Progreſs the Goſpel was like to make in theſe Eaſtern Nations. Firſt he began with the <hi>Nicobar</hi> Iſlands, and told me what I have related of that matter, in the 17 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> page 177, for this was the Perſon I there quoted, and from whom I had that Relation; as he told me he had it from the Friar, who wrote to him from <hi>Fort St. George.</hi> But

                  <p>But to proceed with the diſcourſe I had with the <hi>French</hi> Prieſt at <hi>Hean.</hi> He told me, that in <hi>Siom</hi> the Goſpel was in a very fair way to receive incouragement by the means of a <hi>French</hi> Biſhop there, and ſeveral Eccleſiaſticks he had with him there to aſſiſt him: That the great Miniſter of State, <hi>Conſtant Falcon,</hi> had embraced the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Faith; and that the King was very much inclined to it, the Courtiers alſo ſeeming well enough pleaſed with it. Inſomuch that 'twas hop'd that in a ſhort time the whole Nation would be converted: And that tho' the Country People in general were againſt it, yet by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the King and his Court, the reſt might come over by degrees; eſpecially becauſe the Prieſts had free Toleration to uſe their endeavours. As for <hi>Tonquin,</hi> he told me that the People in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral were inclined to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, but that the Government was wholly averſe to it: that the Miſſionaries who lived here did not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs to be Teachers of their Doctrine, but that they lived here under the notion of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and not as Clergy-Men; that this was a great Obſtacle to Chriſtianity, yet nevertheleſs they found ways to draw the People from their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: that at preſent they had about 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>000 Converts, and more coming in daily. He told me, that here were two Biſhops, I think both <hi>French</hi> Men; one of them was entitled the Biſhop of <hi>Aſcalon</hi> the other of <hi>Auran;</hi> and that here were

But ſince I have been informed, that theſe <hi>French</hi> Biſhops were not ſuffered to live at <hi>Cachao;</hi> neither may they at any time go thither without a Licence from the Governour; and ſuch a Licence alſo muſt be procur'd by the Favour of ſome <hi>Mandarin</hi> who lives at <hi>Cachao,</hi> for whom the Biſhop or other Miſſionary is to perform ſome trivial Work or other. For the Miſſioners living here are purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſkill'd in mending Clocks, Watches, or ſome Mathematical Inſtruments, of which the Country People are Ignorant; and this gives them the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being often ſent for to <hi>Cachao</hi> by the <hi>Mandarins:</hi> And when they are there, a ſmall job that would not require above 5 or 6 Hours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they will be twice as many days about, pretending great difficulty in the work; by which means they take their liberty, privately to teach their Diſciples that live there; and then alſo they enjoy themſelves with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, to whom they are always welcome.</p>
                  <p>As to the Converts theſe People have made, I have been credibly informed that they are chiefly of the very poor People, and that in the ſcarce times, their Alms of Rice have converted more than their preaching: and as to thoſe alſo who have been converted, as they call it, that is to Beads and new Images, and belief in the Pope, they have fallen off again, as Rice grew plentiful, and would no longer be Chriſtians than while the Prieſts adminiſtred Food to them. Yet I cannot think but that theſe People, who have ſuch Notions of a ſupreme Deity, might by the induſtry and example of good Men, be brought to embrace the Chriſtian Faith. But as things ſtand at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it ſeems very improbable that Chriſtianity ſhould fructify there: For as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and

                     <hi>Dutch</hi> in theſe parts of the World are too looſe Livers to gain Reputation to their Religion, ſo are the other <hi>Europeans,</hi> I mean the Miſſionary Prieſts, eſpecially the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but very blind Teachers. But indeed as the Romaniſts are the only Men who compaſs Sea and Land to gain Proſelytes, ſo they may ſeem to have one advantage over <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in theſe Idolatrous Countries, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them with ſuch kind of Objects for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip as they have been uſed to already: For the exchange is not great from <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols to Images of Saints, which may ſerve altogether as well for the poor Souls they convert, who are guided only by ſenſe. But then even here alſo, theſe People having been bred up in the belief of the goodneſs of their own Gods or Heroes, they will more hardly be brought over to change their own Idols for new ones, without ſome better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove theſe to be more valuable, than the Miſſionaries ordinarily are able to afford them: and If I may freely ſpeak my opinion, I am apt to think, that the groſs Idolatry of the Papiſts is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a prejudice, than advantage to their Miſſions: and that their firſt care ſhould be to bring the People to be virtuous and conſiderate, and their next, to give them a plain Hiſtory and Scheme of the Fundmental Truths of Chriſtianity, and ſhew them how agreeable they are to natural light, and how worthy of God.</p>

Then he aſked me many queſtions about the Coals, what were proper to be uſed, but that I could not ſatisfie him in. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to try to make a pound, and withal told me, that he had all the ingredients, and an Engine to mix them. I was eaſily perſwaded to try my ſkill, which I had never yet tried, not knowing what I might be put to before I got to <hi>England;</hi> and having drank a glaſs or two of Wine with him, I went to work; and it ſucceeded ſo well, that I pleaſed him extremely, and ſatisfied my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of trying the Receipt, and the Reader ſhall have the Hiſtory of the Operation, if he pleaſes. He brought me Sulphur and Salt-petre, and I weighed a portion of each of theſe, and of Coals I gathered up in the hearth, and beat to powder. While his Man mixed theſe in a little Engine, I made a ſmall Sieve of Parchment, which I pricked full of Holes, with a ſmall Iron made hot, and this was to corn it. I had 2 large Coco-nuts to roul in the Sieve, and work it thro' the holes to corn it. When it was dry we proved it, and it anſwer'd our expectation.

The Salt-petre was ſunk to the bottom of the Jars, but I mixt it and beat it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and corned it with Sieves which I made of my own old Parchment Draughts. I made thus 8 Barrels full of very good Powder before I went from thence. The <hi>French</hi> Prieſt told me in concluſion, that the Grandees make all their own Powder; and ſince I have been informed, that the Soldiers make Powder, as I have already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I ſpent the remainder of the day in the Palace with the Prieſt. He told me that the Biſhop was not well, otherwiſe I ſhould have ſeen him: and that becauſe it was a Fiſh day, I could not expect ſuch entertainment, as I might have had on another day; yet he ordered a Fowl to be broiled for my Dinner, and I dined by my ſelf. In the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening he ſent me out of the Palace, deſiring to be excuſed, that he could not entertain me all night: yet he ordered his Man to lodge me in a <hi>Tonquineſe</hi> Chriſtian Houſe not far from thence. The People were civil, but very poor, and my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as I had met with on the Road. I have ſince been told, that the new Chriſtians come to do their Devotion in the Palace at Night, and for that reaſon probably, I was ſo ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</p>
                  <p>I was now again pretty well refreſhed, and might have gone to <hi>Cachao</hi> City a foot: but fearing my ſtrength, I choſe to go by Water.

The Boat was about the bigneſs of a <hi>Graveſend</hi> Wherry, and was uſed purpoſely to carry Paſſengers, having a ſmall covering over-head to keep them dry when it rained. There were 4 or 5 more of theſe Boats, that went up this Tide full of Paſſengers. In our Boat were about 20 Men and Women, beſides 4 or 6 that rowed us. The Women choſe their places and ſate by themſelves, and they had much reſpect ſhewed them: but the Men ſtowed cloſe together, without ſhewing any reſpect more to one than to another, yet all very civil. I thruſt in among the thickeſt of them at firſt, but my Flux would not ſuffer me to reſt long in a place. About midnight we were ſet aſhore to refreſh our ſelves at a Baiting place, where there were a few Houſes cloſe by the Rivers ſide, and the people up, with Candles lighted, Arack and Tea, and little ſpits of Meat, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ready dreſt, to receive us. For theſe were all Houſes of entertainment, and probably got their living by entertaining Paſſengers. We ſtayed here about an hour, and then entered again on our Boat, and rowed forwards. The Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſpent the time in merry Diſcourſe, or Singing, after their way, tho' to us it ſeems like crying; but I was mute for want of a perſon I could converſe with. About 8 or 9 a clock the next day I was ſet aſhore: the reſt of the Paſſengers remained in the Boat, but whither they were bound I know not, nor whither the Boat went quite up to <hi>Cachao.</hi> I was now 5 or 6 mile ſhort of the City, but in a good path: for the Land here was pretty high, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and ſandy, and the Road plain and dry, and I reached <hi>Cachao</hi> by Noon.

This my weakneſs, joyned with my diſappointment; for I found that I was not like to be employed in any Voyage to the Neighbouring Countries, as it had been purpoſed to me, made me very deſirous of returning back again, as ſoon as might be: and it hapned opportunely, that Captain <hi>Weldon</hi> had by this time done his buſineſs, and was preparing for his departure.</p>
                  <p>I went therefore down the River again to our Ships, in a Veſſel our Merchants had hired, to carry their Goods aboard from <hi>Cachao.</hi> Among other freight, there were 2 Bells of about 500 weight each, which had been caſt at <hi>Cachao</hi> by the <hi>Tonquineſe,</hi> for my Lord <hi>Falcon,</hi> the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s chief Miniſter of State, and for the uſe of ſome of the Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Siam.</hi> The perſon who beſpoke them, and was to carry them, was Captain <hi>Brewſter,</hi> who had not very long before come from <hi>Siam</hi> in a Ship of that King's, and had been caſt away on the Coaſt of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> but had ſaved moſt of his Goods. With theſe he traded at <hi>Cachao,</hi> and among other goods he had purchaſed to return with to <hi>Siam,</hi> were theſe 2 Bells, all which he ſent down to be put on Board Captain <hi>Weldon</hi>'s Ship. But the Bark was no ſooner come to <hi>Hean,</hi> in going down the River, but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Hean</hi>'s Officers came on board the Bark and ſeized the 2 Bells in behalf of the chief of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory; who underſtanding they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> which they were not ſo ſure of as to the reſt of the goods, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> being then at War with the <hi>Siamers,</hi> he made this his pretence for ſeizing them, and got the Governor to aſſiſt him with his Authority: and the Bells were accordingly carried aſhore, and kept at <hi>Hean:</hi> This was thought a very ſtrange

What care was formerly taken to get us a Trade into the <hi>E. Indies,</hi> and othet Countries?

However, 'tis certainly for the intereſt of our Merchants to imploy ſit men in their Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſince the reputation of the Company riſeth or falls by the diſcreet management, or ill conduct of the Agents.

Neither ought this care to be neglected where we have the Trade to our ſelves, for there ought to be a fair underſtanding between us and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and care taken, that they ſhould have no reaſon to complain of unjuſt dealings, as I could ſhew where there has been; but 'tis an invidious ſubject, and all that I aim at is to give a caution. But to the matter in hand, it ſeemed to me that our Factory at <hi>Tonquin</hi> might have got a Trade with <hi>Japan:</hi> and to <hi>China</hi> as much as they pleaſed. I confeſs the continual Wars between <hi>Tonquin</hi> and <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> were enough to obſtruct the deſigns of making a Voyage to this laſt: and thoſe other places of <hi>Champa</hi> and <hi>Cambodia</hi> as they are leſs known, ſo was it more unlikely ſtill to make thither any profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Voyages: yet poſſibly the difficulties here alſo are not ſo great, but reſolution and induſtry would overcome them; and the profit would abundantly compenſate the trouble.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, we found there was no reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Bells: ſo we fell down from <hi>Hean</hi> to our Ships: and Captain <hi>Weldon</hi> coming to us in a few days, and Captain <hi>Brewster</hi> with him, to go as a Paſſenger in his ſhip, together with one or two more; and 2 Ships who came with us being alſo ready for their departure, we all weighed anchor, and took leave of <hi>Tonquin.</hi>

                  <p>Coming out of the Bay of <hi>Tonquin,</hi> we ſtood away Southward, having the Sholes of <hi>Pracel</hi> on our Larboard, and the Coaſts of <hi>Cochinchina, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> and <hi>Cambodia</hi> on our Starboard. I have juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned theſe Kingdoms in my former Volume; and here I have but little to ſay of them, having only ſail'd by them. But not altogether to fail the Readers expectation, I ſhall give a brief account of one or two particulars relating to <hi>Cambodia:</hi> for as to <hi>Champa</hi> I have nothing material to ſpeak; and <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> I have already ſpoken of in this Volume, as I went to <hi>Tonquin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Cambodia</hi> ſeems to be much ſuch a kind of Country within Land, as the lower parts of <hi>Tonquin:</hi> low Land, very woody, and little inhabited, lying on each ſide a great River that comes from the North a great way, and falls into the Sea over againſt <hi>Pulo Condore.</hi> I know not the particular product of <hi>Cambodia,</hi> but in the Veſſels mentioned in my former Vol. p. 399. as taken at <hi>Pulo Uby,</hi> and which came thither from <hi>Cambodia;</hi> there were beſides Rice, Dragons Blood, Lack, in great Jars, but it looked blackiſh and thick; and the yellow purging Gum, which we from thence call <hi>Cambodia,</hi> in great Cakes, but I know not whence they get it. This River and Kingdom (if it be one) is but little known to our Nation, yet ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> men have been there; particularly Captain <hi>Williams</hi> and Captain <hi>Howel,</hi> the laſt of whom I came acquainted with ſome time after this at <hi>Fort St George,</hi> and I had of him the following account, the particulars of which I have alſo had confirmed by the Seamen who where with them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Captains, with many more <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, had been for ſome time in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> and each of them commanded a

The Courſe of the River is generally from North to South: and they found the Land low on each ſide, with many large Creeks and Branches, and in ſome places conſiderable Iſlands. They bended their Courſe up that branch which ſeemed moſt conſiderable, having the Tide of flood with them, and the River commonly ſo wide, as to give them room to turn or make Angles where the bending of the River was ſuch as to receive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Eaſt, or South-Eaſt Sea-Wind. Theſe Reaches or Bendings of the River Eaſt and Weſt were very rare; at leaſt ſo as to make their Courſe be againſt the Sea-wind, which commonly blew in their Stern, and ſo freſh, that with it they could ſtem the Tide of Ebb. But in the night when the Land-winds came, they anchored, and lay ſtill till about 10 or 11 a Clock the next day, at which time the Sea-breezes uſually ſprang up again, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to continue their Courſe, till they came to the Iſland, where the Pirates inhabited. They preſently began to fire at them, and landing their Men, routed them, and burnt their Houſes and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; and taking many Priſoners, returned again.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Piratical People were by Nation <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who when the <hi>Tartars</hi> conquer'd their Country, fled from thence in their own Ships: as choſing

There they built a Town, and fenced it round about with a kind of Wood-pile, or Wall of great Timber Trees laid along, of the thickneſs of 3 or 4 of theſe Trees, and of about as many in heighth. They were provided with all ſorts of Planters Inſtruments, and the Land hereabouts was excellent good, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men told me, ſo that 'tis like they might have lived here happily enough, had their inclinations led them to a quiet Life: but they brought Arms along with them, and choſe to uſe them, rather than their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Husbandry: and they lived therefore moſtly by rapin, pillaging their Neighbours, who were more addicted to traffick than fighting. But the King of <hi>Siam</hi>'s Subjects having been long harraſſed by them at Sea, he firſt ſent ſome Forces by Land to drive them out of their Fort: till not ſucceeding that way, he entirely routed them by ſending theſe 2 Ships up the River. The 2 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captains having thus effected their buſineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of the River with many Priſoners: but the South Weſt Monſoon being already ſet in, they could not preſently return to <hi>Siam,</hi> and therefore went to <hi>Macao</hi> in <hi>China;</hi> as well to wait for the N.

They were well entertained there by the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Governor, and gave him their Priſoners: and upon the ſhifting of the Monſoon, they returned to <hi>Siam.</hi> There they were received with great applauſe.

For theſe ſervices the King gave every year to each of them, a great Silk Coat, on which were juſt 13 buttons.

                     <hi>Brewer's</hi> Streights are ſometimes paſſed by ſmall Ships, that ſail from <hi>Batavia</hi> to <hi>Malacca,</hi> becauſe for them it is a nearer cut, than to run ſo far as <hi>Pulo Timaon,</hi> or the Streights of <hi>Sincapore.</hi> In this Channel, tho' in ſome places we found but 14 or 15 foot Water, yet the bottom was ſoft Oaze: and it lies ſo among Iſlands, that there cannot go a

Captain <hi>Weldon</hi> had alſo a <hi>Dutch</hi>-man aboard who had been this way, and he profeſſing to know the Channel, incouraged our Captain to try it, which we affected very well, tho ſometimes we had but little more water than we drew. This made us make but an eaſy Sail, and therefore we were 7 or 8 days before we arrived at <hi>Malacca;</hi> but Captain <hi>Lacy</hi> was there 2 or 3 days before us.</p>
                  <p>Here we firſt heard of the Death of <hi>Conſtant Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> for whom Captain <hi>Brewſter</hi> ſeemed to be much concerned. There alſo we found, beſides ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Sloops, and our Companion Captain <hi>Lacy,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel of 35 or 40 Tuns. This Veſſel was bought by one Captain <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who was ſent by the Governor of <hi>Bencouli,</hi> in a ſmall Sloop, to trade about the Iſland of <hi>Sumatra</hi> for Pepper, but Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> being killed, the Sloop was brought hither by one Mr. <hi>Wells.</hi>

                  <p>Being thus inſenſibly fallen into the mention of this Captain <hi>Johnſon;</hi> and intending to defer what little I have to ſay of <hi>Malacca,</hi> till my coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again from <hi>Achin,</hi> I ſhall beſtow the reſt of this Chapter in ſpeaking of this Man's Tragedy, and other occurrences relating to it; which tho' of no great moment in themſelves, yet the Circumſtances I ſhall have occaſion to relate with them, may be of uſe to the giving ſome ſmall light into the ſtate of the oppoſite Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> which was the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

To go on therefore with his Story, it ſeems Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> was part owner of the ſmall <hi>Bencouli</hi> Sloop: but thinking it too ſmall for his turn, he came to <hi>Malacca,</hi> intending to buy a larger Sloop of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> if he could light of a bargain. He had

Of theſe ſort of Veſſels therefore the <hi>Dutch</hi>-men of <hi>Malacca</hi> have plenty, and can afford good pennyworths; and doubtleſs it was for this reaſon that Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> came hither to purchaſe a Sloop. Here he met with a bargain, not ſuch a Proe bottom reformed, but an old ill ſhaped thing, yet ſuch a one as pleaſed him. The <hi>Dutch</hi>-man who ſold him this Veſſel, told him withal, that the Government did not allow any ſuch dealings with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tho' they might wink at it: and that therefore the ſafeſt way for them both to keep out of trouble, would be to run over to the other ſide of the Streights, to a Town called <hi>Bencalis,</hi> on <hi>Sumatra;</hi> where they might ſafely buy and ſell, or exchange without any notice taken of them. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Johnſon</hi> accepting the offer, they ſailed both together over to <hi>Bencalis,</hi> a <hi>Malayan</hi> Town on that Coaſt, commanding the Country about it. There they came to an anchor, and Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> paying the price agreed on for the Veſſel, he had her deliver'd to him. The <hi>Dutch</hi>-man immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned over to <hi>Malacca</hi> again, leaving Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> with 2 Veſſels under his Command, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sloop that he brought from <hi>Bencouli,</hi> and this new-bought Veſſel. The <hi>Bencouli</hi> Sloop he ſent into a large River hard by, to Trade with the <hi>Malayans</hi> for Pepper, under the Command of Mr. <hi>Wells.</hi> He was no Seaman; but a pretty intelligent Perſon, that came firſt out of <hi>England</hi> as a Soldier, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After ſome ſtay there, he was ſent with Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> to aſſiſt him in this Pepper Expedition; more becauſe he could uſe his Pen, than his Hands in Sea ſervice. He had 3 or 4 raw Seamen with him to work the Sloop up into the River. Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſtayed near <hi>Bencalis</hi> to fit his new Veſſel: for with other neceſſaries ſhe wanted a new Boltſprit, which he intended to cut here, having a Carpenter with him for that purpoſe; as alſo to repair and fit her to his mind. He had alſo a few other raw Seamen, but ſuch as would have made better Landmen, they having ſerved the King of <hi>Siam</hi> as Soldiers: and they were but lately come from thence with the <hi>French,</hi> who were forced to leave that Country. But here in the <hi>Indies,</hi> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> are forced for want of better, to make uſe of any Seamen ſuch as they can get, and indeed our Merchants are often put hard to it for want of Seamen. Here are indeed <hi>Laſcars</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Seamen enough to be hired; and theſe they often make uſe of: yet they always covet an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man or 2 in a Veſſel to aſſiſt them. Not but that theſe <hi>Laſcars</hi> are ſome of them indifferent good Sailors, and might do well enough: but an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man will be accounted more faithful, to be employed on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moment; beſide the more free Converſation that may be expected from them, during the term of the Voyage. So that tho' oft times their <hi>Engliſh</hi> men are but ordinary Sailors, yet they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to ſome charge of which they could not be ſo capable any where but in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> Theſe Seamen would be in a manner wholly uſeleſs in <hi>Europe,</hi> where we meet with more frequent and hard ſtorms, but here they ſerve indifferent well,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> eſpecially to go and come with the Monſoons; but enough of that.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> being gone to purchaſe Pepper, Capt. <hi>Johnſon</hi> went aſhore about 5 or 6 Leagues from <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calis</hi> Town with his Carpenter, to cut a Boltſprit; there being there plenty of Timber Trees fit for his purpoſe. He ſoon choſe one to his mind, and cut it down. He and his Carpenter wrought on it the firſt and ſecond days without moleſtation. The 3d. day they were both ſet upon by a band of armed <hi>Malayans,</hi> who killed them both. In the evening the Sailors who were left aboard, lookt out for their Commander to come off: but night approaching without ſeeing or hearing from him. This put them in ſome doubt of his ſafety; for they were ſenſible enough, that the <hi>Malayans</hi> that inhabited thereabouts were very treacherous: as indeed all of them are, eſpecially thoſe who have but little Commerce with Strangers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all people ought to be very careful in dealing with them, ſo as to give them no advantage; and then they may Trade ſafe enough.</p>
                  <p>There were but 4 Seamen aboard Captain <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's</hi> Sloop. Theſe being terrified by the abſence of their Commander, and ſuſpecting the truth, were now very apprehenſive of their own ſafeties. They charged their Guns, and kept themſelves on their guards, expecting to be aſſaulted by the <hi>Malayans.</hi> They had 2 Blunderbuſſes, and 3 or 4 Muſkets: each man took one in his Hand, with a Caduce-box at his Waſte, and looked out ſharp for fear of any Enemy. While they were thus on their guard, the <hi>Malayans</hi> in 6 or 8 Canoas came very ſilently to attack the Sloop. They were about 40 or 50 Men, armed with Lances and Creſſes. The darkneſs of the night favoured their deſigns, and they were even aboard before the Seamen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. Then theſe began to Fire, and the

The Seamen reſolutely defended her, and drove them overboard again. Of the 4 Seamen, 2 were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wounded in the firſt attack. The <hi>Malay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took freſh Courage and entred again; and the 2 Seamen who were not wounded, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cloſe quarters in the Steerage; and there being Loop-holes to fire out at, they repulſed the <hi>Malayans</hi> again, forcing them into their Canoas. There bellies being now pretty full, they returned aſhore without hopes of conquering the Sloop. The poor Seamen were ſtill in fear, and kept watch all night; intending to ſell their Lives as dear as they could, if they had been attacked again. For they might not, neither did they expect quarter, from theſe Salvage <hi>Malayans:</hi> but they were no more aſſaulted. Theſe two that were wounded, dyed in a ſhort time.</p>

                  <p>It was 2 or 3 days before Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> came to them. He had not then received the Letter, and therefore they ſuſpected the <hi>Shabander</hi> of falſhood; tho' his men were yet very kind, and ſerviceable to the 2 Seamen. Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> had heard nothing of their diſaſters, but returned for want of Trade; at leaſt ſuch a full Trade as he expected. For tho' here is Pepper growing, yet not ſo much as might allure any one to ſeek after it: for the <hi>Dutch</hi> are ſo near, that none can come to Trade among them but by their permiſſion. And tho' the Natives themſelves were never ſo willing to Trade with any Nation, as indeed they are, yet the Dutch could ſoon hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, even by deſtroying them, if in order to it they ſhould ſet themſelves to produce much Pepper. Such ſmall quantities as they do at preſent raiſe up, or procure from other parts of the Iſland, is lickt by the Dutch, or by their friends of <hi>Bencalis</hi> for them: for the Town of <hi>Bencalis</hi> being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of theſe parts, and ſo nigh <hi>Malacca,</hi> as only parted by the narrow Sea or Streights, 'tis viſited by the Dutch in their ſmall Veſſels, and ſeems wholly to depend on a Trade with that Nation, not daring to Trade with any beſides: and I judge it is by the friendſhip of the Town, that the Dutch drive a ſmall Trade for Pepper in theſe parts, and by it alſo vend any of their own Commodities: and theſe alſo trading with their Neighbours into the Country, do bring their Cmmodities hither, Where the Dutch come for them. The People of <hi>Bencalis</hi> therefore, tho' they are <hi>Malayans,</hi> as the reſt of the Country, yet they are civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For Trade has a ſtrong influence upon all People, who have found the ſweet of it, bringing with it ſo many of the Conveniencies of Life as it does. And I believe that even the poor <hi>Americans,</hi> who have not yet taſted the ſweetneſs of it, might be allured to it by an honeſt and juſt Commerce: even ſuch of them as do yet ſeem to covet no more than a bare ſubſiſtence of meat and drink, and a clout to cover their nakedneſs. That large Continent hath yet Millions of Inhabitants, both on the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> and <hi>Peruvian</hi> parts, who are ſtill ignorant of Trade: and they would be fond of it, did they once experience it; tho' at the preſent they live happy enough, by enjoying ſuch fruits of the Earth, as nature hath beſtowed on thoſe places, where their Lot is fallen: and it may be they are happier now, than they may hereafter be, when more known to the <hi>Avaritious World.</hi> For with Trade they will be in danger of meeting with oppreſſion: men not being content with a free Traffick, and a juſt and reaſonable gain, eſpecially in theſe remote Countries: but they muſt have the Current run altogether in their own Channel, tho' to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the poor Natives they deal with, of their natural Liberty: as if all mankind were to be ruled by their Laws. The Iſlands of <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Java</hi> can ſufficiently witneſs this; the Dutch having in a manner ingroſt all the Trade of thoſe, and ſeveral of the Neighbouring Countries to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: not that they are able to ſupply the Natives with a quarter of what they want, but becauſe they would have all the produce of them at their own diſpoſal. Yet even in this they are ſhort, and may be ſtill more diſappointed of the Pepper Trade if other People would ſeek for it.

Indeed this place about <hi>Bencalis,</hi> is in a manner at their devotion; and for ought I know, it was through a deſign of being revenged on the <hi>Dutch</hi> that Capt. <hi>Johnſon</hi> loſt his life. I find the <hi>Malayans</hi> in general, are implacable Enemies to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and all ſeems to ſpring from an earneſt deſire they have of a free Trade, which is reſtrained by them, not only here, but in the Spice-Iſlands, and in all other places where they have any Power. But 'tis freedom only muſt be the means to incourage any of theſe remote People to Trade; eſpecially ſuch of them as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and whoſe inclinations are bent this way; as moſt of the <hi>Malayans</hi> are, and the major part of the People of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> even from the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> Eaſtward to <hi>Japan,</hi> both Continent and Iſlands. For tho' in many places, they are limited by the <hi>Dutch, Engliſh, Danes,</hi> &amp;c. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from a free Trade with other Nations, yet have they continually ſhewn what an uneaſineſs that is to them. And how dear has this Reſtraint coſt the <hi>Dutch?</hi> when yet neither can they with all their Forts and Guard-Ships ſecure the Trade wholly to themſelves, any more than the <hi>Barlaventa</hi> Fleet can ſecure the Trade of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> but enough of this matter.</p>
                  <p>You have heard before, that Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> came with his Sloop to <hi>Bencalis,</hi> to the great joy of the two Men, that were yet alive in Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Veſſel.

                  </p>
                  <p>They were all now ſo weakned, that they were but juſt enough to ſail one of the Veſſels. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſent to the <hi>Shabander</hi> of <hi>Bancalis,</hi> to deſire ſome of his Men, to help ſail the Sloops over to <hi>Malacca,</hi> but he refuſed it. Then they offered to ſell one of them for a ſmall matter, but neither would he buy. Then they offered to give him the ſmalleſt: To that he anſwered, that he did not dare to accept of her, for fear of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> and his Crew concluded to take the Pepper and all the Stores out of the ſmall Veſſel, and burn her, and go away with the other to <hi>Malacca.</hi> This they put in execution, and preſently went away, and opening Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Cheſt, they found 2 or 300 Dollars in Money. This with all his Writings, and what elſe they found of value, Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> took in his poſſeſſion. In a very ſhort time they got over to <hi>Malacca.</hi> There they ſtayed expecting the coming of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, to get a Pilot to Navigate the Sloop: for neither of them would undertake to Navigate her farther.

It reaches Eaſtward from that N. W. point of the Iſland, a great way along the Shore, towards the Streights of <hi>Malacca,</hi> for about 50 or 60 Leagues. But from <hi>Diamond</hi> point, which is about 40 Lagues from <hi>Achin,</hi> towads the Borders of the Kingdom, the Inhabitants, tho' belonging to <hi>Achin</hi> are in leſs ſubjection to it. Of theſe I can ſay but little; neither do I know the Bounds of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, either within Land, or along the Weſt Coaſt. That Weſt ſide of the Kingdom, is high and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous: as is generally the reſt of the Weſt Coaſt of the whole Iſland. The point alſo of <hi>Achin,</hi> or extremity of the Iſland, is High Land: but <hi>Achin,</hi> it ſelf and the Country to the Eaſtward, is lower, not altogether deſtitute of ſmall Hills, and every where of a moderate heighth, and a Champion Country, naturally very fit for cultivation.</p>
                  <p>There is one Hill more remarkable than ordinary, eſpecially to Seamen. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> call it, the <hi>Golden Mount:</hi> but whether this name is given it by the Natives, or only by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I know not. 'Tis near the N. W. end of the Iſland; and <hi>Achin</hi> ſtands but 5 or 6 mile from the bottom of it. 'Tis very large at the foot, and runs up ſmaller towards the head; which is raiſed ſo high, as to be ſeen at Sea 30 or 40 Leagues. This was the firſt Land that we ſaw coming in our Proe from the <hi>Nicobar Iſlands,</hi> mentioned in my former Voyage. The reſt of the Land, tho' of a good heighth, was then undiſcerned by us, ſo that this Mountain appeared like an Iſland in the Sea; which was the reaſon why our <hi>Achin Malayans</hi> took it for <hi>Pulo Way.</hi> But that Iſland, tho' pretty high Champion Land, was inviſible, when this <hi>Golden Mount</hi> appeared ſo plain, tho' as far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as that Iſland.</p>

There they anchor at what diſtances they pleaſe, according to the Monſoons or Seaſons of the Year. There is a ſmall Navigable River comes out into the Sea, by which Ships tranſport their Commodities in ſmaller Veſſels up to the City. The Mouth of this River is 6 or 7 Leagues from <hi>Pulo Rondo,</hi> and 3 or 4 from <hi>Pulo Way,</hi> and near as many from <hi>Pulo Gomez.</hi> The Iſlands are pretty high Champion Land, the Mold black or yellow, the Soil deep and fat, producing large tall Trees, fit for any uſes. There are Brooks of Water on the 2 great Iſlands of <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Gomez,</hi> and ſeveral ſorts of wild Animals; eſpecially wild Hogs in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p>The Mold of this Continent is different according to the natural poſition of it. The Mountains are Rocky, eſpecially thoſe towards the Weſt Coaſt, yet moſt that I have ſeen ſeems to have a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial covering of Earth, naturally producing Shrubs, ſmall Trees, or pretty good Graſs. The ſmall Hills are moſt of them cloathed with Woods; the Trees whereof ſeem by their growth to ſpring from a fruitful Soil: the Champion Land, ſuch as I have ſeen, is &amp;;some black, ſome grey, ſome reddiſh, and all of a deep Mold. But to be very particular in theſe things, eſpecially in all my Travels, is more than I can pretend to: tho' it may be I took as much notice of the difference of Soil as I met with it, as moſt Travellers have done, having been bred in my Youth in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> at a place called <hi>Eaſt Cocker</hi> near <hi>Yeovil</hi> or <hi>Evil:</hi> in which Pariſh there is a great Variety of Soil, as I have ordinarily met with any where, <hi>viz.</hi> black, red, yellow, ſandy, ſtony, clay, moraſs or ſwampy, &amp;c.

My Mother being poſſeſt of one of theſe Leaſes, and having of all theſe ſorts of Land, I came acquainted with them all, and knew what each ſort would produce, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wheat, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Maſlin, Rice, Beans, Peas, Oats, Fetches, Flax, or Hemp: in all which I had a more than uſual Knowledge for one ſo young; taking a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular delight in obſerving it: but enough of this matter.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Achin</hi> has in general a deep Mold: It is very well water'd with Brooks and ſmall Rivers, but none navigable for Ships of burthen. This of <hi>Achin</hi> admits not of any but ſmall Veſſels. The Land is ſome part very Woody, in other places Savannah; the Trees are of divers ſorts, moſt unknown to me by name. The Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Cabbage-trees grow here, but not in ſuch plenty as in ſome part of <hi>America.</hi> Theſe Trees commonly grow here, as indeed uſually where-ever they grow, in a Champion dry Ground, ſuch at leaſt as is not drowned or moraſſy; for here is ſome ſuch Land as that by the Rivers; and there grow Mangrove Trees, and other Trees of that kind. Neither is this Kingdom deſtitute of Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees ſit for building.</p>
                  <p>The Fruits of this Country are Plantains, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanoes, Guava's Oranges, Limes, Jacks, Durians, Coco-nuts, Pumple-noſes, Pomgranates, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, Magaſtans, Citrons, Water-melons, Muſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melons,

This Fruit is in ſhape much like the Pomgranate, but a great deal leſs. The outſide rind or ſhell is a little thicker than that of the Pomgranate, but ſofter, yet more brittle; and is of a dark red. The inſide of the ſhell is of a deep crimſon colour. Within this ſhell the Fruit appears in 3 or 4 Cloves, about the bigneſs of the top of a man's thumb. Theſe will eaſily ſeperate each from the other; they are as white as Milk, very ſoft and juicy, incloſing a ſmall black Stone or Kernel. The outſide rind is ſaid to be binding, and therefore many when they eat the Fruit, which is very delicious, do ſave the rind or ſhell, drying it and preſerving it, to give to ſuch as have Fluxes. In a ſmall Book, entituled, <hi>A new Voyage to the Eaſt-Indies,</hi> there is mention made of Mangaſtans, among the Fruits of <hi>Java:</hi> but the Author is miſtaken, in that he compares it to a Sloe, in ſhape, and taſte: Yet I remember there is ſuch a ſort of Fruit at <hi>Achin;</hi> and believe by the deſcription he gives of it, it may probably be the ſame that he calls the Mangaſtan, tho' nothing like the true Mangaſtan.</p>
                  <p>The Pumple-noſe is a large Fruit like a Citron, with a very thick tender uneven rind. The inſide is full of Fruit: It grows all in cloves as big as a ſmall Barly-corn, and theſe are all full of juice, as an Orange or a Lemon, tho' not growing in ſuch partitions. 'Tis of a pleaſant taſte, and tho' there are of them in other parts of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> yet theſe at <hi>Achin</hi> are accounted the beſt. They are ripe commonly about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and they are ſo much eſteemed, that Engliſh men carry them from hence to <hi>Fort St George,</hi> and make Preſents of them to their Friends there. The other Fruits mentioned here, are moſt of them deſcribed by me in my firſt Volume.</p>

The Natives have lately planted ſome quanities of this Grain, and might produce much more were they ſo diſpoſed, the Land being ſo fruitful. They have here a ſort of Herb or Plant called <hi>Ganga,</hi> or <hi>Bang.</hi> I never ſaw any but once, and that was at ſome diſtance from me. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me like Hemp, and I thought it had been Hemp, till I was told to the contrary. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of this Plant, that if it is infuſed in any Liquor, it will ſtupify the brains of any perſon that drinks thereof; but it operates diverſly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of the perſon. Some it makes ſleepy, ſome merry, putting them into a Laughing fit, and others it makes mad: but after 2 or 3 hours they come to themſelves again. I never ſaw the effects of it on any perſon, but have heard much diſcourſe of it. What other uſe this Plant may ſerve for I know not: but I know it is much eſteemed here, and in other places too whither it is tranſported.</p>
                  <p>This Country abounds alſo with Medicinal Drugs and Herbs, and with variety of Herbs for the Pot. The chief of their Drugs is Camphire, of which there are quanities found on this Iſland, but moſt of it either on the borders of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Southward, or more remote ſtill, without the precincts of it. This that is found on the Iſland <hi>Sumatra</hi> is commonly ſent to <hi>Japan</hi> to be refined, and then brought from thence pure, and tranſported whither the Merchants pleaſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. I know that here are ſeveral ſorts of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Herbs made uſe of by the Natives, who go often a ſimpling, ſeeming to underſtand their Virtues much, and making great uſe of them: but this being wholly out of my Sphere, I can give no account of them; and tho' here are plenty of Pot-Herbs,

                  <p>There are many other very profitable Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on this Iſland: but ſome of them are more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to other parts of it than <hi>Achin,</hi> eſpecially Pepper. All the Iſland abounds with that Spice, except only this North Weſt end; at leaſt ſo much of it, as is comprehended within the Kingdom of <hi>Achin.</hi> Whether this defect is through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or lazineſs of theſe People, I know not.</p>
                  <p>Gold alſo is found, by report, in many parts of this Iſland: but the Kingdom of <hi>Achin</hi> is at preſent moſt plentifully ſtored with it. Neither does any place in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> that I know of, yield ſuch quantities of it as this Kingdom. I have never been at <hi>Japan,</hi> and therefore can make no eſtimate of the great Riches of that Kingdom: but here I am certain there is abundance of it.</p>
                  <p>The Land Animals of this Country are Deer, Hogs, Elephants, Goats, Bullocks, Buffaloes, Horſes, Porcupines, Monkeys, Squirrils, Guanoes, Lizards, Snakes, &amp;c. Here are alſo abundance of Ants of ſeveral ſorts, and Woodlice, called by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> White Ants. The Elephants that I ſaw here were all tame: yet 'tis reported there are ſome wild; but I judge not many, if any at all. In ſome places there are plenty of Hogs; they are all wild, and commonly very poor. At ſome times of the Year, when the wild Fruits fall from the Trees, they are indifferent fat, or at leaſt fleſhy: and then they are ſweet and good: they are very numerous; and whether for that reaſon, or ſcarcity of Food, it is very rare to find them fat.

                  <p>The Fowls of this Country are Dunghil Fowls and Ducks; but I know of no other tame Fowls they have. In the Woods there are many ſorts of wild Fowls, <hi>viz.</hi> Maccaws, Parrots, Parakites, Pigeons, and Doves of 3 or 4 ſorts. There are plenty of other ſmall Birds; but I can ſay nothing of them,</p>
                  <p>The Rivers of this Country afford plenty of Fiſh.

Their Hair is black and lank, their Faces generally pretty long, yet graceful enough. They have black Eyes, middling Noſes, thin Lips, and black Teeth, by the frequent uſe of Betle. They are very lazy, and care not to work or take pains. The poorer ſort are addicted to theft, and are often puniſhed ſeverely for it.

                  <p>Their Houſes are built on Poſts, as thoſe of <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danao,</hi> and they live much after the ſame faſhion: but by reaſon of their Gold Mines, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſort of Strangers, they are richer, and live in greater plenty.

This thrives here well enough; but they are ſo proud, that it is againſt their Stomach to work: neither do they themſelves much trouble their heads about it, but leave it to be managed by their Slaves: and they were the Slaves brought lately by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> from the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> in the time of a Famin there, I ſpoke of before, who firſt brought this ſort of Huſbandry into ſuch requeſt among the <hi>Achineſe.</hi> Yet neither does the Rice they have this way ſupply one quarter of their occaſions, but they have it brought to them from their Neigbouring Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Fiſhermen are the richeſt working People: I mean ſuch of them as can purchaſe a Net; for thereby they get great profit; and this ſort of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is managed alſo by their Slaves.

But to proceed with theſe Weights, which they uſe either for Money or Goods, 100 <hi>Catty</hi> make a <hi>Pecul,</hi> which is 132<hi>l. Engliſh</hi> weight. Three hundred <hi>Catty</hi> is a <hi>Bahar,</hi> which is 396<hi>l.

To go thither they ſet out Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, towards <hi>Paſſange Jonca,</hi> and thence ſtrike up into the heart of the Country. I made ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning their getting Gold, and was told, that none but <hi>Mahometans</hi> were permitted to go to the Mines: That it was both troubleſom and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to paſs the Mountains, before they came thither; there being but one way, and that over ſuch ſteep Mountains, that in ſome places they were forced to make uſe of Ropes, to climb up and down the Hills.

That at the Mines it was ſo ſickly that not the half of thoſe that went thither did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return again; tho' they went thither only to Traffick with the Miners, who live there, being ſeaſoned: that theſe who go thither from the City ſtayed not uſually above 4 Months at the Mines, and were back again in about 6 Months from their going out. That ſome there made it their conſtant imployment to viſit the Miners once every Year: for after they are once ſeaſoned, and have found the profit of that Trade, no thoughts of danger can deter them from it: for I was credibly told, that theſe made 2000 <hi>per cent.</hi> of whatever they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with them, to ſell to the Miners: but they could not carry much by reaſon of the badneſs of the ways.

The Goods that they carry thither are ſome ſort of cloathing, and liquor. They carry their Goods from the City by Sea part of the way: Then they land ſomewhere about <hi>Paſſange Jonca,</hi> and get Horſes to carry their Cargo to the foot of the Mountains. There they draw it up with Ropes, and if they have much goods, one ſtays there with them, while the reſt march to the Mines with their load; and return again for the reſt. I had this relation from Captain <hi>Tiler,</hi> who lived at <hi>Achin,</hi> and ſpoke the Language of the Country very well. There was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado that uſed that trade, but was always at the Mines when I was here. At his Return to <hi>Achin</hi> he conſtantly frequented an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Punch-houſe, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Gold very freely, as I was told by the Maſter of the houſe. I was told alſo by all that I diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with about the Gold, that here they dig it out of the Ground; and that ſometimes they find pretty large lumps.</p>
                  <p>It is the product of theſe Mines that draws ſo many Merchants hither, for the Road is ſeldom without 10 or 15 ſail of Ships of ſeveral Nations. Theſe bring all ſort of vendible Commodities, as Silks, Chints, Muzlins, Callicoes, Rice, &amp;c. and as to this laſt, a man would admire to ſee what great quanities of Rice are brought hither by the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Danes</hi> and <hi>Chineſe:</hi> when any arrives, the Commanders hire each a Houſe to put their goods in. The Silks, Muzlins, Callicoes, Opium, and ſuch like rich Goods, they ſell to the <hi>Guzurats,</hi> who are the chief men that keep Shops here; but the Rice, which is the bulk of the Cargo, they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally retail. I have heard a Merchant ſay, he has received 60, 70, and 80<hi>l.</hi> a day for Rice, when it has been ſcarce; but when there are many ſellers,

Thus it riſes and falls as Ships come hither. Thoſe who ſell Rice keep one conſtantly attending to meaſure it out; and the very Grandees themſelves never keep a ſtock before hand, but depend on the Market, and buy juſt when they have occaſion. They ſend their Slaves for what they want, and the poorer ſort, who have not a Slave of their own, will yet hire one to carry a <hi>Meſs</hi> worth of Rice for them, tho' not one hundred paces from their own homes, ſcorning to do it themſelves. Beſides one to meaſure the Rice, the Merchants hire a man to take the Money; for here is ſome falſe Money, as Silver and Copper <hi>Meſs</hi> gilt over: Beſides, here are ſome true <hi>Meſs</hi> much worn, and therefore not worth near their value in tale. The Merchants may alſo have occaſion to receive 10 or 20<hi>l.</hi> at a time for other Commodities; and this too beſides thoſe little ſumms for Rice, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by his Broker, if he will not be cheated; for 'tis work enough to examin every piece: and in receiving the value of 10<hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Meſs,</hi> they will ordinarily be forc'd to return half or more to be chang'd; for the Natives are for putting off bad Money, if poſſibly they can. But if the Broker takes any bad Money, 'tis to his own loſs. Theſe ſort of Brokers are commonly <hi>Guzurats,</hi> and 'tis very neceſſary for a Merchant that comes hither, eſpecially if he is a Stranger, to have one of them, for fear of taking bad or light Money.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants are very welcome here, and I have heard that they do not pay ſo much Cuſtom as other Nations. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Free-men

But of all the Merchants that trade to this City, the <hi>Chineſe</hi> are the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.

They take up Houſes all by one another, at the end of the Town, next the Sea: and that end of the City is call'd the <hi>China Camp,</hi> becauſe there they always quarter, and bring their goods aſhore thither to ſell. In this Fleet come ſeveral Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Carpenters, Joyners, Painters, &amp;c. Theſe ſet themſelves immediately to work, making of Cheſts, Drawers, Cabinets, and all ſorts of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> Toys: which are no ſooner finiſh'd in their Working-houſes, but they are preſently ſet up in Shops and at the Doors to ſale. So that for two Months or ten Weeks this Place is like a Fair, full of Shops ſtuft with all ſort of vendible commodities, and People reſorting hither to buy: and as their goods ſell off, ſo they contract themſelves into leſs compaſs, and make uſe of fewer Houſes. But as their buſineſs decreaſes, their Gaming among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves increaſes; for a <hi>Chineſe,</hi> if he is not at work, had as lieve be without Victuals as without Gaming; and they are very dexterous at it.

The River of <hi>Achin</hi> near the City is always full of People of both Sexes and all Ages. Some come on purpoſe to waſh themſelves, for the Pleaſure of being in the Water: which they ſo much delight in, that they can ſcarce leave the River without going firſt into it, if they have any buſineſs brings them near. Even the ſick are brought to the River to waſh. I know not whether it is accounted good to waſh in all diſtempers, but I am certain from my own Experience, it is good for thoſe that have Flux, eſpecially Mornings and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for which reaſon you ſhall then ſee the Rivers fulleſt, and more eſpecially in the Morning.

                  <p>The Laws of this Country are very ſtrict, and offenders are puniſhed with great ſeverity.

                  <p>I never heard of any that ſuffer'd Death for Theft. Criminals, who deſerve death, are executed divers ways, according to the nature of the offence, or the quality of the offender. One way is by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paling on a ſharp Stake, which paſſeth up right from the Fundament through the Bowels, and comes out at the Neck. The Stake is about the bigneſs of a mans Thigh, placed upright, one end in the ground very ſirm; the upper ſharp end is about 12 or 14 foot high. I ſaw one man ſpitted in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and there he remain'd 2 or 3 days: but I could not learn his offence.</p>
                  <p>Noblemen have a more honourable death; they are allowed to fight for their lives: but the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe with whom they are to engage, ſoon put a period to the Combat, by the death of the Malefactor. The manner of it is thus; the perſon condemned is brought bound to the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. This is a large plain Field, ſpacious enough to contain thouſands of People. Thither the <hi>Achineſe,</hi> armed, as they uſually go, with their Creſſet, but then more eſpecially, reſort in Troops, as well to be ſpectators, as actors in the Tragedy. Theſe make a very large Ring, and in the midſt of the multitude the Criminal is placed, and by him ſuch Arms as are allowed on ſuch occaſions, which are, a Sword, a Creſſet, and a Lance. When the time is come to act, he is unbound, and left at his liberty to take up his fighting Weapons. The ſpectators being all ready, with each man his Arms in his hand, ſtand ſtill in their places, till the Malefactor advances, He commonly ſets out with a ſhriek, and daringly faces the multitude: but he is ſoon brought to the ground, firſt by Lances thrown at him, and afterwards by their Swords and Creſſets.

Nay, they are encouraged by their Maſters, who often lend them Money to begin ſome trade or buſineſs withal: Whereby the Servant lives eaſie, and with great content follows what his Inclination or Capacity fits him for; and the Maſter alſo, who has a ſhare in the gains, reaps the more profit, yet without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When one of theſe Slaves dies, his Maſter is Heir to what he leaves; and his Children, if he has any, become his Slaves alſo: unleſs the Father out of his own clear gains has in his life time had wherewithal to purchaſe their Freedom. The Markets are kept by theſe People, and you ſcarce

The Money-changers alſo are Slaves, and in general all the Women that you ſee in the ſtreets; not one of them being free. So are the Fiſher-men, and others who fetch Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in Canoas from <hi>Pulo Gomez,</hi> for thence thoſe of this City fetch moſt of their Wood, tho' there is ſcarce any thing to be ſeen but Woods about the City. Yet tho' all theſe are Slaves, they have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations or houſes to themſelves in ſeveral parts of the City, far from their Maſters Houſes, as if they were free People. But to return to the <hi>Shabander</hi> I was ſpeaking of, all Merchant Strangers, at their firſt arrival, make their Entries with him, which is always done with a good Preſent: and from him they take all their diſpatches when they depart; and all matters of importance in general between Merchants are determined by him.

                  <p>But to return to the Queen of <hi>Achin,</hi> I think Mr. <hi>Hackluit</hi> or <hi>Purchas,</hi> makes mention of a King here in our King <hi>James</hi> I. time. But at leaſt of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Years there has always been a Queen only, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who reſide there, have been of the Opinion that theſe People have been governed by a Queen <hi>ab Origine;</hi> and from the antiquity of the preſent conſtitution, have formed notions, that the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> who came to <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Queen of this Country: and the Author of an old Map of the World, which I have ſeen, was, it ſeems of this Opinion, when writing the old <hi>Hebrew</hi> names of Nations, up and down the ſeveral parts anciently known of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> he puts no other name in the Iſle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> but that of <hi>Sheba.</hi> But be that as it will, 'tis at preſent part of it under a Queen, tho' ſhe has little power or authority: for tho' there is ſeemingly abundance of reſpect and reverence ſhewn her, yet ſhe has little more than the title of a Sovereign, all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being wholly in the hands of the <hi>Oronkeys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While I was on my Voyage to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> the old Queen died, and there was another Queen choſen in her room, but all the <hi>Oronkeys</hi> were not for that Election; many of them were for chuſing a King.

This Army was on the Eaſt ſide of the River, and had all the Country on that ſide, and ſo much of the City alſo, as is on that ſide the River, under their Power: But the Queen's Palace and the main part of the City, which ſtands on the Weſt-ſide, held out ſtoutly. The River is wider, ſhallower, and more ſandy at the City, than any where elſe near it: yet not fordable at low Water. Therefore for the better communication from one ſide to the other, there are Ferry-boats to carry Paſſengers to and fro. In other places the Banks are ſteep, the River more rapid, and in moſt places very muddy: ſo that this place, juſt at the City it ſelf, is the moſt convenient to tranſport Men or Goods from one ſide to the other.</p>
                  <p>It was not far from this place the Army lay, as if they deſigned to force their paſſage here. The Queens party, to oppoſe them, kept a ſmall Guard of Soldiers juſt at the Landing-place. The <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bander</hi> of <hi>Achin</hi> had a Tent ſet up there, he being the chief manager of her Affairs: and for the more ſecurity, he had 2 or 3 ſmall braſs Guns of a Minion Bore planted by his Tent all the day, with their Muzzels againſt the River. In the Evening there were 2 or 3 great Trees drawn by an Elephant, and placed by the ſide of the River, for a Barricado againſt the Enemy: and then the Braſs Guns were drawn from the <hi>Shabander</hi>'s Tent, which ſtood not far from it, and planted juſt behind the Trees, on the riſing Bank: So that they looked over the Trees, and they might Fire over, or into the River, if the Enemy approached.

This was the Tone all night long; in the morning as ſoon as Sun was riſen, the Gu ns were drawn again to the <hi>Shabanders</hi> Tent, and the Trees were drawn aſide, to open the Paſſage from one ſide to the other: and every Man then went freely about his buſineſs, as if all had been as quiet as ever, only the <hi>Shabander</hi> and his Guard ſtaid ſtill in their ſtations: So that there was not any ſign of Wars, but in the night only, when all ſtood to their Arms: and then the Towns-people ſeemed to be in fear, and ſometimes we ſhould have a Rumour, that the Enemy would certainly make an attempt to come over.</p>

Yet ſome of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> fearing the worſt, would every night put their richeſt Goods into a Boat, ready to take their flight on the firſt Alarm. There were at this time not above 2 or 3 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families in the Town, and 2 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and one <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, beſides 2 or 3 <hi>Moors</hi> Ships of the Moguls Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the Road.

He had at this time about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty great Jars of <hi>Bengal</hi> Butter, made of Buffaloes Milk; and this Butter is ſaid alſo to have Lard or Hogs fat mixt with it, and rank enough in theſe hot Countries, tho' much eſteemed by all the <hi>Achineſe,</hi> who give a good price for it; and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo uſe it. Each of the Jars this came in contained 20 or 30 Gallons; and they were ſet in Mr. <hi>Driſcal</hi>'s Yard at <hi>Achin:</hi> What other Goods the Captain brought I know not.</p>
                  <p>But not long after this he being informed that the <hi>Moors</hi> Merchants reſiding here had carried off a great Treaſure aboard their Ships, in order to return with it to <hi>Surrat,</hi> and our Company having now Wars with the Great Mogul, Captain <hi>Thwait</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drew of all his Seamen, and ſeized on one of the <hi>Moors</hi> Ships, where he thought the Treaſure was. The biggeſt he let alone: She was a Ship that one Captain <hi>Conſtant</hi> took in the Road ſometime before, and having plundered her, he gave her to the Queen, of whom the <hi>Moors</hi> bought her again. The <hi>Moors</hi> Merchants had ſpeedy notice of this Action of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Thwait,</hi> and they preſently made their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Queen for ſatisfaction.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> It was 11 or 12 a Clock the next day, before we who lived aſhore heard of Captain <hi>Thwaits</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but ſeeing the <hi>Moors</hi> flock to Court, and not knowing what anſwer they had from the Queen, we poſted off to the Ships, for fear of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, as ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men had been while I was at <hi>Tonquin,</hi> on the like ſcore. Indeed I had at this time great cauſe to be afraid of a Priſon, being ſick of a Flux, ſo that a Priſon would have gone near to have killed me: yet I think it fared not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with me, for the Ships I fled to afforded me but little comfort. For I knew no man aboard the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothy,</hi> and could expect no comfort there. So I and the reſt went aboard the <hi>Nellegree,</hi> where we could more reaſonably expect relief, than in a Ship that came from <hi>England:</hi> for theſe which come ſo long a Voyage, are juſt victualled for the Service, and the Seamen have every one their ſtinted allowance, out of which they have little enough to ſpare to Strangers.</p>
                  <p>But tho' there were Victuals enough aboard the <hi>Nellegree,</hi> yet ſo weak as I then was, I had more mind to reſt my ſelf than to eat: and the Ship was ſo peſtered with Goods, that I could not find a place to hang up my Hammock in. Therefore it being fair weather, I made a ſhift to lye in the Boat that I came aboard in. My Flux was violent, and I ſlept but little; ſo I had the opportunity of obſerving the Moon totally Eclipſed, had I been in a condition to obſerve any thing. As ſoon as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Moon to be eclipſed, I gazed at it indeed, as I lay, till it was totally obſcured, which was a pretty while: but I was ſo little curious, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not ſo much as what day of the Month it was; and I kept no Journal of this Voyage, as I did of my other, but only kept an account of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particular Remarks and Obſervations as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to me. I lay three or four days thus in this

Thus that Fray was over, and we came aſhore again, recovered of the fright we had been in. In a ſhort time alſo after this, the <hi>Achineſe</hi> all agreed to own the new Queen, and ſo the War ended without any Bloodſhed.</p>
                  <p>I was perſwaded to waſh in the River, Mornings and Evenings, for the recovery of my Health: and tho' it ſeemed ſtrange to me before I tryed it, yet I found ſo much comfort in the firſt trial, that I conſtantly appyed my ſelf to it. I went into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till the water was as high as my waſte, and then I ſtooped down and found the water ſo cool and refreſhing to my Body, that I was always loth to go out again. Then I was ſenſible that my Bowels were very hot, for I found a great heat within me, which I found refreſht by the cool water. My Food was Salt-fiſh broyled, and boyled Rice mixt with <hi>Tire. Tire</hi> is ſold about the Streets there: 'tis thick ſower milk. It is very cooling, and the Salt-fiſh and Rice is binding: therefore this is thought there the proper food for the common people, when they have Fluxes. But the Richer Sort will have <hi>Sago,</hi> which is brought to <hi>Achin</hi> from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Milk of Almonds.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the ſtate of <hi>Achin,</hi> before I go off from it I ſhall add this ſhort account of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of year there, that their weather is much the ſame as in other Countries North of the Line, and their dry Seaſons, Rains, and Land-floods come much at the ſame time, as at <hi>Tonquin</hi> and other places of North Latitude.

I have ſeen it rain there for 2 or 3 days without intermiſſion; and the River running but a ſhort courſe, its head not lying very far within Land, it ſoon overflows; and a great part of the Street of the City, ſhall on a ſudden be all under water; at which time People row up and down the Streets in Canoas. That ſide of the City towards the River eſpecially, where the Foreign Merchants live, and which is lower ground, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under Water in the wet Seaſon: a Ships Long-boat has come up to the very Gate of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory laden with Goods; which at other times is ground dry enough, at a good diſtance from the River, and moderately raiſed above it. I did not find the heat there any thing different from other places in that Latitude; tho' I was there both in the wet and dry Seaſon. 'Tis more ſupportable than at <hi>Tonquin;</hi> and they have conſtantly the Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sea and Land Breezes every 24 Hours.</p>

I preſently did as I was ordered; and finding that I ſhould not go this Voyage. I ſold alſo my ſmall Cargo, which conſiſted only of ſome Coco-nuts and about 100 Nutmegs, which had the Shells on as they grew on the Trees.

The <hi>French</hi> were all ſent away ſome Months before, being not ſuffered to ſtay in the Kingdom: but before this Ship came from thence, the Broyls of State were over; for the new King being ſettled, all Tumults which commonly ariſe in theſe Countries at the Death of the King, were appeaſed. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were then deſired to ſtay there, and thoſe who had yielded up their Places and Offices, were even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to accept them again, for they owned that they had all ſerved the Nation faithfully. But not long before the Revolution, the Governour of <hi>Fort St. George</hi> ſent for all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from thence particularly, and from the Service of all other <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, to come and ſerve the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company at the Fort, or where elſe they ſhould ſend them.

                     <hi>Tyler</hi> was minded to ſell part of her. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they met about it, and the Veſſel was divided into four parts, three of which were purchaſed by Mr. <hi>Dalton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coventry,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Minchin,</hi> and Captain <hi>Tyler</hi> kept the 4th. The next day Capt. <hi>Minchin</hi> came off with an order to me to deliver him the poſſeſſion of the Ship, and told me, that if I liked to go his Mate, I might ſtill keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board till they had agreed on a Voyage. I was forced to ſubmit, and accepted a Mates Employ under Captain <hi>Minchin.</hi> It was not long before we were ordered for <hi>Malacca</hi> to buy Goods there. We carried no Goods with us, beſides 3 or 400 pound of Opium.</p>
                  <p>It was about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> 1689. when we ſailed from <hi>Achin.</hi> We were four white Men in the Veſſel, the Captain, and Mr. <hi>Coventry,</hi> who went Supercargo, my ſelf and the Boatſwain. For common Seamen we had 7 or 8 <hi>Moors:</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in theſe Country Ships the White-men are all Officers. Two days after we left <hi>Achin,</hi> being becalmed under the Shore, we came to an Anchor. Not long after a Ship coming in from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, came to an anchor about 2 mile a-head of us. Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> knew her to be a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Trangambar;</hi> and therefore we hoiſted out our Boat, and thought to have ſpoken with her: but a ſmall breeze ſpringing up, they weighed their Anchors and went away; neither would they ſpeak with us, tho' we made ſigns for them to ſtay. We weighed alſo and jogg'd on after them, but they ſailed better than we. We met little Winds and Calms, ſo that it was ſeven or eight days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we got as far as <hi>Diamond-point,</hi> which is about forty leagues from <hi>Achin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being about four leagues ſhort of that point, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Minchin</hi> deſired me to ſet the Land, and withal prick the Card, and ſee what Courſe we ought to

                  <p>After I had ſet the Land, I went into the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin to look over the Draught to ſee what courſe we muſt ſteer after we came about the Point. Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> followed me, and when I had ſatisfied my ſelf, he aſked me what courſe we muſt ſteer? I told him E. S. E. till 12 a clock, if the gale ſtood, and then we might hale more Southerly. He ſeemed to be ſtartled at it, and told me, that the Captain and he had been pricking the Card, and thought that S. E. or S. E. by S. courſe would do well at 8 a clock. I ſaid it was a good courſe to run aſhore; he argued a long time with me, but I perſiſted in my opinion, and when I told Captain <hi>Minchin</hi> of my opinion, he was well ſatisfied. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after this we had a pretty ſtrong Tornado out of the S. W. which obliged us to hand our Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail. When the ſtreſs of the weather was over, we ſet our ſails again, and went in to Supper, and ordered the Man at Helm not to come to the Southward of the E. S. E. We ſtayed in the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin till about 8 a clock, and then we came out to ſet the Watch. It was now very dark, by reaſon of a Thunder-Cloud that hung rumbling over the Land: yet by the flaſhes of lightning we plainly ſaw the Land, right a-head of us. I was much ſurprized, and ran into the Steeridge to look on the Compaſs, and found that we were ſteering S. S. E. inſtead of E. S. E. I clapt the Helm a Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and brought her to N. E. by E. and N. E. and we very narrowly eſcap'd being caſt away.</p>
                  <p>When we firſt went to Supper we were 3 leagues off Land, and then E. S. E. was a good courſe, the Land lying E. S. E. parallel with our courſe.</p>

I believe we had alſo ſome counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current, or Tide that help'd us in, for we were quickly got into a Bay within the points of Land. So that 'twas now abſolutely neceſſary to ſteer Northerly to get out of the Bay; and by this time Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> was ſatisfied with what I told him in the Evening, and was convinced of his Error. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to direct the Man at Helm, and the Wind continuing, I kept off till ten a clock: then I ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed E. S. E. till 12, and then haled up S. S.

                  <p>The Land from hence lying S. S.

                  <p>About a League before we came to that River, being within 2 mile of the Shore, we ſaw the Water of a muddy grey colour, and taſting it, ſound it to be ſweet. Therefore we preſently filled ſome of our Water Caſk; and 'tis an ordinary thing in ſeveral places to take up freſh Water at Sea, againſt the mouth of ſome River where it floats above the Salt-water: but we muſt dip but a little way down; for ſometimes if the Bucket goes but a foot deep it takes up Salt-water with the freſh.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening we had a fine Land Breeze, with which we ran along the Shore, keeping on a wind, and ſounding every now and then. At laſt we were got among the Sholes, at the mouth of that River, and puzled to get out again. The River

It ſeems to be very large, but it is not well known, but only to the Natives, who inhabit it; and they are not very ſociable; but are, by report, a ſort of Pirats living on rapin. In the Morning we ſaw a Sail ſtanding off to an Iſland called <hi>Pulo Verero,</hi> lying in Lat. 3 d. 30 m.

They came to an Anchor about 2 or 3 a clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: but the Wind ſlacken'd, and it was 8 a Clock at night before we came thither. We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored about a mile from them, and preſently hoyſed out our Boat to go aboard: for we judged that this was the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ship, that we ſaw when we came firſt from <hi>Achin.</hi> I went in the Boat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> told me, that Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> was Surgeon of her, the ſame Perſon who was with me in the Boat when I was ſet a ſhore at the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> Iſles, but was not ſuffered to ſtay with me.

For it ſeems they were extreamly afraid of us, inſomuch that the Commander, ſeeing us follow them in the morning, would not have touched at theſe Iſlands, tho' he was in great want of Water; and had not his Black Merchants fallen before him on their Knees, and even prayed him to take pity on them, they had not anchored here. Theſe Merchants were Inhabitants of <hi>Trangambar</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel.</hi> They having no Ships of their own, when the <hi>Danes</hi> fit out a Ship, on any Voyage that they are inclined to, theſe <hi>Moors</hi> are obliged to joyn Stock with them, and they firſt make an Offer of it to them as a kindneſs: and the <hi>Moors</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſirous to Trade, frequently accept of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on any Terms: but ſhould they be unwilling, yet dare they not refuſe, for fear of diſobliging the <hi>Danes,</hi> who are Lords of the place. In this Ship I found Mr. <hi>Coppenger:</hi> and he was the firſt that I had ſeen of all the Company that left me at the <hi>Nicobar</hi> Iſlands.

Theſe Shoals lye ten leagues from <hi>Pulo Arii,</hi> and continue till within 2 or 3 of the <hi>Malacca</hi> ſhoar. In the Channel there is 12 or 14 fathom water, but you may keep in 7 or 8 fathom on either ſide; and ſounding all the way, you may paſs on without danger.</p>
                  <p>We had a good gale at Weſt, which brought us in ſight of <hi>Pulo Parſalore:</hi> and ſo we kept ſounding till we came within the Shoar, and then we had the Town of <hi>Malacca</hi> about 18 leagues diſtant from us, to the S.

Being ſhot over to the <hi>Malacca</hi> ſhore, there is a good wide Channel to ſail in, you having the Shoals on one ſide, and the Land on the other; to which laſt you may come as nigh as you ſee convenient, for there is water enough, and good anchoring. The Tide runs pretty ſtrong here; the Flood ſets to the Eaſtward, and the Ebb to the Weſt: and therefore when there is little wind, and Ships cannot ſtem the Tide, they commonly anchor. But we being in with the <hi>Malacca</hi> Shoar, had a weſterly Wind, which brought us before <hi>Malacca</hi> Town, about the middle of <hi>October;</hi> and here I firſt heard that King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were crowned King and Queen of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Dane</hi> that left us at <hi>Pulo Verero</hi> was not yet arrived: for, as we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards underſtood, they could not find the way through the Sands, but were forced to keep along without them, and fetch a great Compaſs about, which retarded their Paſſage.</p>

There are alſo many of the Native <hi>Malayans</hi> inhabiting in ſmall Cottages on the Skirts of the Town. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Houſes are built with Stone, and the Streets are wide and ſtraight, but not paved. At the North Weſt of the Town there is a Wall and Gate to paſs in and out: and a ſmall Fort always guarded with Soldiers. The Town ſtands on a level low ground, cloſe by the Sea. The Land on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Town ſeems to be moraſſy, and on the Weſt ſide, without the Wall, there are Gardens of Fruits and Herbs, and ſome fair <hi>Dutch</hi> Houſes: but that Quarter is chiefly the habitation of the <hi>Malay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> On the Eaſt ſide of the Town, there is a ſmall River which at a Spring Tide will admit ſmall Barks to enter. About 100 paces from the Sea there is a Draw-bridge, which leads from the midſt of the Town to a ſtrong Fort, built on the Eaſt ſide of the River.</p>
                  <p>This is the chief Fort, and is built on a low level ground, cloſe by the Sea, at the Foot of a little ſteep Hill. Its form is ſemicircular, according to the natural poſition of the adjacent Hill. It fronts chiefly to the Sea, and having its foundation on firm Rocks, the Walls are carried up to a good height, and of a conſiderable thickneſs. The lower part of it is waſhed by the Sea every Tide. On the back of the Hill, the Land being naturally low, there is a very large Moat cut from the Sea to the River, which makes the whole an Iſland; and that back part is ſtockadoed round with great Trees, ſet up an end: ſo that there is no entring when once the Draw-bridge is haled up. On the Hill, within this Fort ſtands a ſmall Church big enough to receive all the Towns-people, who come hither on <hi>Sundays</hi> to hear Divine Service: and on the Main,

The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> at this place, by report, made uſe of the Native Women at their pleaſure, whether Virgins or Married Women; ſuch as they liked they took without control: and it is probable, they as little reſtrained their luſt in other places; for the Breed of them is ſcattered all over <hi>India;</hi> neither are there any People of more different Complexions than of that Race, even from the coal-black to a light tawney.

                     <hi>Malacca</hi> is a place of no great Trade, yet there are ſeveral <hi>Moors</hi> Merchants always reſiding here.

Some of them keep Tea-houſes, were for a Stiver a man has near a pint of Tea, and a little Porrenger of Sugar-candy, or other Sweet-meats, if he pleaſes. Others of them are Butchers: their chief fleſh is Pork, which you may have very reaſonably, either freſh or ſalted: Neither are you deſired to take any particular piece, but they will cut a piece at one place, and the like at another, either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for other Proviſions, their Rice is brought to them from abroad. Such Fruits as they have are much the ſame as I have already deſcribed and are proper to the Climate, as Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-apples, Oranges, Water-melons, Pumple-noſes, Mango's, &amp;c. but theſe are only in their Gardens, in no great plenty; and the Country is all covered with Wood, like one Foreſt: and moſt of our Walking-Canes uſed in <hi>England,</hi> are brought from thence. They have alſo a few Cattle, Bullocks, and Horſes, &amp;c. having but little Paſturage, but good ſtore of tame Fowl, Ducks, and Poultry. The principal perſon in the Town is the <hi>Shahander,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> man, next in power to the Governour, who lives in the Fort, and meddles not with Trade, which is the <hi>Shahander</hi>'s Province, who ſeems to be chiefly concerned about the Cuſtoms of Goods.</p>
                  <p>This Town has no great Trade, by what I could ſee, but it ſeems to be deſignedly built to command the paſſage of Shipping, going this way to the more <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations. Not but that Ships may paſs far enough out of reach of their Cannon; but Guardſhips belonging to the Town, and lying in the Road, may hinder others from paſſing. How the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> managed their Affairs I know not;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0799400300:172"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> commonly keep a Guardſhip here; and I have been told they require a certain Duty of all Veſſels that paſs this way, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only excepted: for all Ships touch at this place, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Wood, Water, and Refreſhment.</p>
                  <p>Two days after our arrival here, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ship came alſo to an Anchor; but reporting that they were bound to <hi>Jihore,</hi> to lade Pepper, the <hi>Dutch</hi> told them it was but in vain for them to ſeek a Trade there; for that the King of <hi>Jihore</hi> had agreed with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Trade only with them; and that to ſecure that Trade, they had a Guardſhip lying there. I had this account from the Surgeon, Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> who ſeemed a little concerned at it: becauſe when he told me this, he could not tell whether they ſhould proceed thither or no; but they did go thither, and ſound all this a ſham, and Traded there to their own and the Natives ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as he told me the next time I met him. This of <hi>Jihore</hi> being but a ſmall Kingdom on the ſame <hi>Malacca</hi> Coaſt, 'tis not of ſtrength ſufficient to reſiſt the power of the <hi>Dutch:</hi> neither could it benefit the <hi>Dutch</hi> to take it, ſhould they attempt it; for the people would probably forſake it, and it would be too great a charge for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to ſettle it themſelves. And therefore they only endeavour to ingroſs the Pepper Trade; and it is probable enough that the <hi>Dutch</hi> might ſometimes keep a Guardſhip there, as they do at other places, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at <hi>Queda, Pulo Dinding,</hi> &amp;c. For where there is any Trade to be had, yet not ſufficient to maintain a Factory; for where there may not be a convenient place to build a Fort, ſo as to ſecure the whole Trade to themſelves, they ſend their Guardſhips, which lying at the mouth of the Rivers, deter Strangers from coming thither, and keep the petty Princes in awe of them. They commonly make a

This probably cauſes ſo many petty Robberies and Piracies as are commited by the <hi>Malayans</hi> on this Coaſt. The <hi>Malayans,</hi> who inhabit on both ſides the Streights of <hi>Malacca,</hi> are in general a bold People, and yet I do not find any of them addicted to Robbery, but only the pilfering poorer ſort, and even theſe ſeverely puniſhed among the Trading <hi>Malayans,</hi> who love Trade and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. But being thus provoked by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and hindred of a free Trade by their Guard-ſhips, it is probable, they therefore commit Piracies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or connive at and incourage thoſe who do. So that the Pirates who lurk on this Coaſt, ſeem to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o it as much to revenge themſelves on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for reſtraining their Trade, as to gain this way what they cannot obtain in way of Traffick.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our concerns here. I have ſaid already, that we had only 3 or 400<hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> in Goods, the reſt was in Money to the value of 2000 Dollars in the whole: but we did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that we came hither purpoſely to trade, but that finding our Veſſel unfit for the Sea, we put in here to mend and repair her. Leave was granted us for this; and I prepared to hale our Veſſel aſhore, at the Weſt end of the Town, not far from the ſmall Fort. It is there ſoft Oazy ground, near a mile off ſhore, and it deepens very leiſurely, being ſhole water juſt by the ſhore; and when the Tide goes out, it leaves the Oaz dry a quarter of a mile from the ſhore: but a mile from ſhore, you have clean Sand, and about 4 fathom at low Water. Our Veſſel floated in cloſe to the Fort, and lay not 20 yards from it, and at low water it ſunk down into the mud: that we could not fit the after-part, as I would

But in ſhort, Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> found a Cuſtomer, and they found means to get it aſhore, while the Soldiers of the Fort were at dinner. The Cuſtomer was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man; and the price he was to pay for it was as much as he was worth: and finding it to be nought, he would have been off his Bargain; and when Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> would not releaſe him, he abſconded. But Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> having an Intereſt in the <hi>Shabander,</hi> he compell'd the Man's Wife to pay for the <hi>Opium,</hi> under the Name of Gold; for ſo Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> call'd it. The <hi>Shabander</hi> chid Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> for ſmugling with an inferiour, when he might have done it better with him: but ſtood his Friend in compelling the Woman, tho' unjuſtly, to pay for the <hi>Opium.</hi> I ſaw this <hi>Dutch</hi>-man on board his own Veſſel, when he had bought the <hi>Opium,</hi> and he was very penſive and ſad. He had a pretty fine Houſe without the Gates, and a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which maintained his Family with Pot-Herbs, Sallading, and Fruits, beſides ſome for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. This was managed by his Wife, and he himſelf had two Sloops; and either imployed them in Trading among the <hi>Malayans</hi> for Pepper, carrying them ſuch Commodities as they wanted, eſpecially <hi>Opium,</hi> or by hiring himſelf and Sloop to the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company, to go whither they would ſend him. It was not long ſince he had been at the Spice Iſlands with Rice, which he ſold at a profitable rate: but he told me he was not ſuffered to bring any Spice from thence, except eight or ten pound for his own ſpending: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there ſo much profit that way for him,

It was on this Home Trade that he was now bound, and the <hi>Opium</hi> had been very beneficial to him, had it been good: but he went away and ordered his Wife not to pay for it, but left Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> to take it again; and upon the <hi>Shabander</hi>'s compelling her to take it and pay for it, ſhe complained they were utterly undone, for the <hi>Opium,</hi> when it came to be examined was really very bad, and worth little or nothing.</p>
                  <p>Here Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> bought Irons Bars, Arack, Canes, and Rattans, wherewith we load our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which was now ſet afloat again. The <hi>Dutch</hi> brought moſt of our Goods aboard, and were more kind then I expected, for they had not uſed to Trade with us, and I believe the news of our Revolution in <hi>England</hi> had ſweetned them; for they often drank the Konings Health with us very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily. While we were here we made two new Cables of Rattans, each of them 4 Inches about. Our Captian bought the Rattans, and hired a <hi>Chineſe</hi> to work them, who was very expert at making ſuch wooden Cables. Theſe Cables I found ſerviceable enough after, in mooring the Veſſel with either of them; for when I carried out the Anchor, the Cable being thrown out after me, ſwam like Cork in the Sea: ſo that I could ſee when it was tight, which we cannot ſo well diſcern in our Hemp Cables, whoſe weight ſinks them down: nor can we carry them out but by placing two or three Boats at ſome diſtance aſunder,

                  <p>WE departed from <hi>Malacca</hi> towards <hi>Achin</hi> about the middle of <hi>November</hi> 1689. Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> being weary of Captain <hi>Minchin</hi>'s Company, had bought a ſmall Veſſel of 7 or 8 Tuns, and laded her alſo with the ſame kind of Goods. This he commanded himſelf, having a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Pilot, and 3 or 4 Mariners under him, and we ſet out both Ships in Company together. We had now in Captain <hi>Minchin</hi>'s Ship but 2 white Men, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and I, the Boatſwain being gone with Mr.

                     <hi>Coventry;</hi> but we took in as a Paſſenger one Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who having lately married a <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman at <hi>Malacca,</hi> came aboard us with her, to go as Paſſengers to <hi>Achin</hi> with us.</p>
                  <p>We had a Land Wind in the morning and about 11 a clock had the Wind at N. W. a pretty ſtrong gale: and at 12 our Fore-yard broke in the middle. We made ſigns to Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> to bear down to us; who weighing before was a mile to Windward of us; but he kept on, fearing to return, as having bought his Ship there by ſtealth: and we therefore returned alone into <hi>Malacca</hi> Road. As ſoon as we anchored, Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> was ſent aſhore to buy a new Yard; I gave him the length and bigneſs. It was Evening before he came aboard again, and he brought aboard an old Yard much too big and too long for us. This piece I ſhortned and ſhaped to my mind, and by 12 a clock at Night, had it fixed and ſlung, rigg'd and the Sail bent to it.</p>
                  <p>Then we weighed again having a ſmall land Wind; but the Tide of flood was againſt us, and drove us to the Eaſtward. When the Ebb came we jogg'd on, and got about three leagues, anchoring when the flood came, becauſe the Winds were againſt us. Thus we continued plying with the Ebb, and ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every flood, till we came to <hi>Pulo Parſelore,</hi> where the Captain told me he would not go out the ſame way we came in, as I would have perſuaded him, but kept the <hi>Malacca</hi> Shore aboard, and paſt within the Sholes. But in a few Hours after we ran upon a Shole, driven on it by the Tide of Flood, which here ſet to the Eaſtward, tho' by our reckoning it ſhould have been half Ebb, and the flood ſhould have ſet Weſtward, as we had it all the reſt of the way from <hi>Malacca:</hi> but the Sholes probably cauſed ſome whirling about of the Tide. However, the Sand we were ſtuck upon was not above 100 yards in circumference, and the flood being riſing we
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0799400300:179"/>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1688</label> waited the time of high Water, and then drove over it, having ſent our Boat to diſcover how the Sholes lay, while our Ship was a-ground: Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> all the while being in great fear, leſt the <hi>Malayans</hi> ſhould come off in their Boats and attack the Veſſel.</p>
                  <p>We were now afloat again, and ſoon got without all the Sholes: yet we did not ſtand over towards <hi>Sumatra,</hi> but coaſted along neareſt the <hi>Malacca</hi> ſhore, it being now moſt proper for us ſo to do yet; for having the Winds weſterly, we could not have beat under the other ſhore. 2 or 3 days after this we had ſight of ſome Iſlands called <hi>Pulo Sambilong,</hi> which in the <hi>Malayan</hi> Language ſignifies nine Iſlands, there being ſo many of them, lying ſcattering at unequal diſtances from each other. It was near one of theſe Iſlands, that Captain <hi>Minchin</hi> in a former Voyage was like to looſe his hand by a prick with a Cat-fiſhes Fin, as I have ſaid in my former Vol. p. 149. und tho' his hand was cured, yet he has loſt the uſe of it ever ſince; and is never likely to regain it more.</p>
                  <p>We ſtood in pretty near the ſhore, in hopes to gain a freſh Land Wind. About 10 a Clock the Land Wind came off, a gentle breez, and we coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the ſhore. But a ſmall Tornado coming off from the ſhore about midnight, we broke our Mizen Yard, and being near a <hi>Dutch</hi> Iſland called <hi>Pulo Dinding,</hi> we made in for it, and anchored there the Night enſuing, and found there a <hi>Dutch</hi> Sloop, mann'd with about 30 Soldiers at an anchor.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſmall Iſland lying ſo nigh the Main, that Ships paſſing by cannot know it to be an Iſland. It is pretty high Land and well watered with Brooks. The Mould is blackiſh, deep and fat in the lower Ground: but the Hills are ſomewhat Rocky yet in general very Wood. The Trees are of divers ſorts, many of which are good Timber, and large enough for any uſe. Here are alſo ſome good for Maſts and Yards; they being naturally

                  <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are the only Inhabitants, have a Fort on the Eaſt ſide, cloſe by the Sea, in a bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Iſland, which makes a ſmall Cove for Ships to anchor in. The Fort is built 4 ſquare, without Flankers or Baſtions, like a Houſe: every Square is about 10 or 12 yards. The Walls are of a good thickneſs, made of ſtone, and carried up to a good heighth, of about 30 foot, and covered over head like a dwelling Houſe. There may be about 12 or 14 Guns in it, ſome looking out at every Square. Theſe Guns are mounted on a ſtrong Platform, made within the Walls, about 16 Foot high; and there are ſteps on the out ſide to aſcend to the Door that opens to the Platform, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way into the Fort. Here is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and about 20 or 30 Soldiers, who all lodge in the Fort. The Soldiers have their lodging in the Platform among the Guns, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour has a fair Chamber above it, where h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In this Houſe there were two or three Rooms for their uſe, but the chiefeſt was the Governours Dining Room. This fronted to the Sea, and the end of it looked towards the Fort. There were two large Windows of about 7 or 8 Foot Square; the lower part of them about 2 or 3 foot from the Ground. Theſe Windows were wont to be left open all the day, to let in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Breeze; but in the night, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour withdrew to the Fort, they were cloſed with ſtrong ſhutters, and the Doors made faſt til<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe are in all reſpects, as to their Religion, Cuſtom, and manner of Living, like other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layans.</hi> Whether they are governed by a King or Raja, or what other manner of Government they live under, I know not. They have Canoas and Boats of their own, and with theſe they fiſh and traffick among themſelves: but the Tin Trade is that which has formerly drawn Merchant Strangers thither. But tho' the Country might probably yield great quanities of this Metal, and the Natives are not only inclinable, but very deſirous to trade with Strangers, yet are they now reſtrained by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have monopoliz'd that Trade to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It was probably for the lucre of this Trade that the <hi>Dutch</hi> built the Fort on the Iſland; but this not wholly anſwering their ends, by reaſon of the diſtance between it and the Rivers mouth, which is about 4 or 5 miles, they have alſo a Guardſhip commonly lying here, and a Sloop with 20 or 30 armed men, to hinder other Nations from this Trade. For this <hi>Tutaneg</hi> or Tin is a valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in the Bay of <hi>Bengal,</hi> and here purchaſed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, by giving other Commoditiesin exchange: neither is this Commodity peculiarly found here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, but farther Northerly alſo on the Coaſt; and particularly in the Kingdom of <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Dinding,</hi> no Strangers dare approach to trade; neither may any Ship come in hither but with conſent of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Therefore as ſoon as we came to an Anchor at the Eaſt end of the Iſland, we ſent our Boat a ſhore to the Governour, to deſire leave to wood, water, and cut a new Mizin yard. He granted our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and the Boat returned again aboard, and brought word alſo that Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> touch'd here to water, and went out that morning. The next morning betimes Captain <hi>Minchin</hi> ſent me aſhore to cut a Yard. I applyed my ſelf to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and deſired one of his Soldiers might go with me, and ſhew me the beſt Timber for that uſe; but he excuſed himſelf, ſaying, that his Soldiers were all buſie at preſent, but that I might go and cut any Tree that I lik'd. So I went into the Woods, where I ſaw abundance of very fine ſtrait Trees, and cut down ſuch a one as I thought fit for my turn: and cutting it of a juſt length, and ſtripping off the Bark, I left it ready to be fetcht away, and return'd to the Fort, where I dined with the Governour. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after dinner, our Captain, with Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> and his Wife came aſhore, and I went aboard. The Governour met them at Landing, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into the Dining Room I ſpoke of, where they treated the Govenour with Punch, made of Brandy, Sugar, and Lime-juice, which they brought with them from aboard: for here is nothing, not ſo much as the Governours drink, but what is brought from <hi>Malacca:</hi> no Herbs or Fruit growing here: but all is either fetch from <hi>Malacca,</hi> or is brought by the <hi>Malayans</hi> from the Main.

But to return to the Governour, he, to retalliate the Captains and Mr. <hi>Richard</hi>'s kindneſs, ſent a Boat a fiſhing, to get ſome better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Gueſts, than the Fort yielded at preſent. About 4 or 5 a Clock the Boat returned with a good Diſh of Fiſh. Theſe were immediately dreſt for Supper, and the Boat was ſent out again to get more, for Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> and his Lady to carry aboard with them. In the mean time the Food was brought into the Dining-Room, and placed on the Table. The Diſhes and Plates were of Silver, and there was a Silver Punch-Bowl full of Liquor. The Govenour, his Gueſts, and ſome of his Officers were ſeated, but juſt as they began to fall to, one of the Soldiers cried out, <hi>Malayans,</hi> and ſpoil'd the Entertainment; for immediately the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour without ſpeaking one word, leapt out of one of the Windows, to get as ſoon as he could to the Fort. His Officers followed, and all the Servants that attended were ſoon in motion. Every one of them took the neareſt way, ſome out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, others out of the Doors, leaving the 3 Gueſts by themſelves, who ſoon followed with all the haſte they could make, without knowing the meaning of this ſudden conſternation of the Governour and his People. But by that time the Captain and Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> and his Wife were got to the Fort, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who was arrived before, ſtood at the door to receive them. As ſoon as they were entred the Fort, the Door was ſhut, all the Soldiers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants being within already: nor was any man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to fetch away the Victuals, or any of the Plate: but they fired ſeveral Guns to give notice

For this Uproar was occaſioned by a <hi>Malayan</hi> Canoa full of armed Men that lay ſkulking under the Iſland, cloſe by the Shore: and when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Boat went out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to fiſh, the <hi>Malayans</hi> ſet on them ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and unexpected, with their Creſſets and Lances, and killing one or two, the reſt leapt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and got away, for they were cloſe by the Shore; and they having no Arms were not able to have made any reſiſtance. It was about a mile from the Fort: and being landed, every one of them made what haſte he could to the Fort, and the firſt that arrived was he who cried in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and frighted the Governour from Supper. Our Boat was at this time aſhore for water, and was filling it in a ſmall Brook by the Banquetting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. I know not whether our Boats Crew took notice of the Alarm, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> call'd to them; and bid them make haſte aboard, which they did; and this made us keep good watch all night, having all our Guns loaden and primed for ſervice. But it rained ſo hard all the night, that I did not much fear being attack'd by any <hi>Malayans;</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of our Sea-men, whom we took in at <hi>Malacca,</hi> that the <hi>Malayans</hi> ſeldom or never make any attack when it rains.

Captain <hi>Minchin</hi> was ſtill aſhore, and he being acquainted with it, deſired the Governor to ſend a Soldier, to ſhew our Men what Trees were beſt for our uſe: Which he did, and they preſently cut a ſmall Tree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We now waited only for a Land Wind to carry us out. The former part of the Night we had much Rain, with Thunder and Lightning, but no Wind. At one a Clock we had a ſmall Land Wind, and got up our Anchors. We got out before Day clear of the Iſland, and we ſteered along ſhore to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, intending to keep this ſhore aboard for 20 or 30 Leagues farther, if the Winds did not favour us; for the Sea Winds were now at N.

We ſtood over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as high as <hi>Pallacat;</hi> and having then a fair North Eaſt Wind, we run along the Coaſt till we came before <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> which was about the middle of <hi>January.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was much pleaſed with the beautiful proſpect this place makes off at Sea. For it ſtands in a plain Sandy ſpot of Ground, cloſe by the ſhore, the Sea ſometimes waſhing its Walls, which are of Stone and high, with Half Moons and Flankers, and a great many Guns mounted on the Battlements: ſo that what with the Walls and fine Buildings within the Fort, the large Town of <hi>Maderas</hi> without it, the Pyramids of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tombs, Houſes, and Gardens adjacent, and the variety of fine Trees ſcatter'd up and down, it makes as agreeable a Landskip as I have any where ſeen.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not my deſign to enter into a Deſcription of a place ſo well known to my Country-Men as this is. It may ſuffice to have mentioned it; and that after ſome Months ſtay here, and meeting with Mr. <hi>Moody</hi> and <hi>Jeoly</hi> the Painted Prince, I prepared to go for <hi>Sumatra</hi> again; to <hi>Bencouli,</hi> as I have ſaid in my former Vol. p. 512. I ſet out from <hi>Fort St. George</hi> with Captain <hi>Howel</hi> in <hi>July.</hi> 1690. we ſteered a pretty way along the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> before we ſtood over for <hi>Sumatra;</hi> and then made the beſt of our way for <hi>Bencouli.</hi> I have in that Volume ſpoken of my Arrival there: but having given no account of the place, I ſhall do it briefly now, and ſo ſhut up this <hi>Suppliment.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bencouli</hi> lies on the Weſt Coaſt of the Iſland of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,</hi> in about 4 d. S. Lat. It is a place noted enough at Sea; by reaſon of a high ſlender Hill in the Country. It has a ſmall Iſland before it within which Ships ride. The point of <hi>Stillabar</hi> lies 2 or 3

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1690</label> Leagues to the Southward of it, and runs out farther than any part of the Shore, making a ſmall Bay within it. Beſides theſe marks, when you come within 2 or 3 Leagues of the Shore, you'll ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fort fronting to the Sea, which makes a fine ſhow: On the N. W. of the Fort is a ſmall River, at the Mouth of which is a large Store-houſe to put Pepper in. About a quarter of a Mile from the Sea ſtands a ſmall <hi>Indian</hi> Village, cloſe by the River; on the ſame ſide that the Fort is on, and but a ſmall diſtance from it. The Houſes are ſmall and low, all built on Poſts, after the <hi>Malayan</hi> manner, as at <hi>Mindanao</hi> and <hi>Achin;</hi> for 'tis a Swamp that the Town ſtands on: But the <hi>Malayans</hi> uſually chooſe to build in ſuch low places near Rivers, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of waſhing themſelves, which they greatly delight in; as 'tis indeed a part of their Religion as <hi>Mahometans:</hi> And if they can, they will have their Houſes ſtand on Poſts over the River.</p>
                  <p>The Weather here is none of the pleaſanteſt. There are great Rains chiefly in <hi>September, October,</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> and pretty great Heats. But when the Wind blew hard, which 'twould often do, the Air would be chill: And the Sea-breezes in fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were generally pretty freſh and comfortable. The Land Winds coming over Swamps, uſually brought a Stink with them. 'Tis in general an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy Place; and the Soldiers of the Fort were ſickly and died very faſt. On the South ſide of the Fort is a fair champion Savannah, of a Mile or Two Square, called <hi>Greenhil.</hi> It produces long thick Graſs: The N. W. part of it fronts the Sea, and the S. E. is bounded with lofty Woods.</p>
                  <p>The Soil of this Country is very different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its different poſition: For within Land 'tis hilly, yet thoſe Hills are clothed with Trees; which ſhews it to be fruitful enough. The low Land, near the River, eſpecially near the Sea, is ſwampy, producing nothing but Reeds, or Bamboes:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0799400300:189"/>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1690</label> But the higher Ground, which is of a reaſonable heighth, is very fruitful. The Mould is deep, and is either black or yellow; and in ſome places Clay; or ſuch Mould as is very proper for making Bricks.</p>
                  <p>The Trees in the Woods are moſtly large bodied, ſtraight and tall: They are of divers ſorts, ſome or other of them fit for any uſes. The Fruits of the Country are much the ſame as at <hi>Achin</hi> and <hi>Malaca, viz.</hi> Limes, Oranges, Guava's, Plantains, Bonanoes, Coco Nuts, Jacks, Durains, Mangoes, Mangaſtans; Pomkins, Pine apples, and Pepper. The Roots are Yams, and Potatoes: Rice grows here pretty well alſo; but whether the Natives ſow enough for their own ſpending or no, I know not. The Land Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are Buffaloes, Bullocks, Deer, Wild Hogs, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupines, Guanoes, Lizards, &amp;c. The tame Fowls are Ducks and Dunghil Fowls, both in great plenty. The wild Fowl are Parrots, Parakites, Pidgeons, Turtle-Doves, and many ſort of ſmaller Birds.</p>
                  <p>The Natives alſo are ſwarthy <hi>Indians,</hi> like their Neighbours of <hi>Achin.</hi> They are ſlender, ſtraight, active, and induſtrious. They are ſociable and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Trade; but if they are affronted, they are treacherous and revengeful. They live together in Towns, and ſpeak the <hi>Malayan</hi> Language: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves in their Habit, Food, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms to other <hi>Malayans;</hi> who are all, ſo far as I learnt, of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion. There are ſome Mechanicks among them; a few Smiths: But moſt of them are Carpenters, and let themſelves out to hire to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the Fort. The Hatchets they work with are ſuch as they uſe at <hi>Mindanao,</hi> ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as to ſerve alſo for an Ads. Here are alſo Fiſhermen, who get a livelihood by Fiſhing; and there are ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh on the Coaſt, beſides plenty of Green Turtle: Such of the <hi>Malayans</hi> as live near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fort are uſually employed in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies Service, to work for

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1690</label> them: but the Country People are moſt Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They plant Roots, Rice, Pepper-buſhes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Pepper is the chief vendible Commodity in this Country, it thrives very well on all the Coaſt; but the greateſt quantity of what is exported from hence, is either brought down this River out of the Country, or fetched from <hi>Sillabar,</hi> or other places bordering on the Sea in ſmall Veſſels. Pepper grows plenty in other places of this Iſland; as at <hi>Indrapore, Pangaſanam, Jamby, Bancalis,</hi> &amp;c. It grows alſo on the Iſland <hi>Java,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Malacca, Malabar, Cochinchina,</hi> &amp;c. The Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi> is ſaid to produce the beſt; or at leaſt there the Natives take moſt care to have the beſt, by letting it grow till it is full ripe; for which reaſon it is larger and fairer than here, where they gather it too ſoon, to avoid loſing any: for as ſoon as it grows ripe 'tis apt to ſhed, and fall in waſte to the ground.</p>
                  <p>It was the Pepper Trade that drew our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants to ſettle here. For after <hi>Bantam</hi> was loſt, our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were wont to trade thither for this ſpice, were at a great loſs to regain the Pepper Trade, which now was in a manner fallen with the other ſorts of Spice into the hands of the <hi>Dutch:</hi> tho' the Pepper which we were wont to fetch from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi> did not all grow on this Iſland <hi>Java,</hi> nor perhaps the tenth part of it; for as I have been informed it came moſt from <hi>Sumatra,</hi> particularly from <hi>Bencooly,</hi> and the adjacent parts. For this Reaſon it behoved our Merchants to get an Intereſt here to prop up their declining Trade. Yet, as I have been told, the ſucceſs was more owing to the Natives of this place than themſelves; for that ſome of the <hi>Raja</hi>'s of the Country ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Fort St. George</hi> to invite the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hither to take poſſeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould get it; who are never ſlack to promote their Intereſt, and were now ſetting out on the ſame deſign. But however that were, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the good fortune to get hither firſt:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0799400300:191"/>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1690</label> though ſo narrowly, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were within an ace of preventing them, their Ships being in ſight before our Men got aſhore. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> coming thus too late, were put by their deſigns; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> immediately got aſhore ſome Guns, and ſtood ready to defend their intereſt. This might happen about the Year 1685, as I was informed; for they told me it was 5 or 6 years before I came hither: and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> immediately fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Fort, as I ſaid before, fronts to the Sea, and ſtands about 100 paces from the River. There has been a great deal of coſt beſtowed on it, but to little purpoſe; for 'tis the moſt irregular piece I ever ſaw. I told the Governor the beſt way was to new model it, and face it with Stone or Brick, either of which might be eaſily had. He ſaid he liked my Counſel, but being ſaving for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he rather choſe to repair it, by the making ſome Alterations: but ſtill to as little purpoſe, for 'twas all made ground and having no facing to keep it up, 'twould moulder away every wet ſeaſon, and the Guns often fall down into the Ditches. What was poſſible to be done I endeavoured to do while I was there. I made the Baſtions as regular as I could upon the Model they were made by: and whereas the Fort was deſigned to be a <hi>Pentagone,</hi> and there were but 4 of the Baſtions made, I ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out ground for a 5th, and drew a plan of it, which I gave the Government; and had I ſtaid longer I ſhould have made up the other Baſtion: but the whole Plan is too big by half for ſo ſorry a Gariſon; and the beſt way of mending it, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh all of it, and make a new one.</p>
                  <p>The Fort was but ſorrily governed when I was there; nor was there that care taken to keep a fair Correſpondence with the Natives in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as I think ought to be, in all Trading places eſpecially. When I came thither there were 2 Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Raja</hi>'s in the Stocks, for no other reaſon, but

Yet theſe <hi>Raja</hi>'s rule in the Country, and have a conſiderable number of Subjects: Who were ſo exaſperated at theſe Inſolencies, that, as I have ſince been informed, they came down and aſſanlt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fort, under the Conduct of one of theſe <hi>Raja</hi>'s. But the Fort, as bad as it is, is Guard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt ſuch indifferent Soldiers as they are: Who tho' they have Courage enough, yet ſcarce any Arms beſides Back-ſwords, Creſſets, and Lances, nor skill to uſe Artillery, if they had it. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time they made an Attempt to ſurprize the Fort, under pretence of a Cock match; to which they hoped the Garriſon would come out to ſhare in the Sport, and ſo the Fort left with ſmall Defence. For the <hi>Malayans</hi> here are great lovers of Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighting, and there were about 1000 of them got together about this Match, while their armed Men lay in ambuſh. But it ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>AMong other things referr'd to in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Volume, I mentioned an Account I intended to give of the Bay of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy,</hi> where I lived firſt and laſt about 3 Years.

                  <p>My Friends did not originally deſign me for the <hi>Sea,</hi> but bred me at <hi>School</hi> till I came to Years fit for a Trade. But upon the Death of my Father and Mother, they who had the diſpoſal of me, took other Meaſures; and having removed me from the <hi>Latine School</hi> to learn <hi>Writing</hi> and

                     <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> they ſoon after plac'd me with a Maſter of a Ship at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> complying with the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations I had very early of ſeeing the <hi>World:</hi> With him I made a ſhort Voyage to <hi>France:</hi> and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence, went to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> being then about eighteen Years of Age. In this Voyage I ſpent one <hi>Summer;</hi> but ſo pinched with the rigour of that cold Climate, that upon my return I was abſolutely againſt going to thoſe parts of the <hi>World,</hi> but went home again to my Friends. Yet going up a while after to <hi>London,</hi> the offer of a <hi>warm Voyage</hi> and a <hi>long</hi> one, both which I always deſired, ſoon carried me to Sea again. For hearing of an outward-bound <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Man, the <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Capt. <hi>Earning</hi> Commander, I entered my ſelf aboard, and was employed before the Maſt, for which my two former <hi>Voyages</hi> had ſome way qualified me. We went directly for <hi>Bantam</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Java,</hi> and ſtaying there about two Months, came home again in little more than a year; touching at St. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> of the <hi>Cape Verd</hi> Iſlands at our going out, and at <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> in our return. In this <hi>Voyage</hi> I gain'd more experience in Navigation, but kept no Journal. We arrived at <hi>Plymouth</hi> about two Months before <hi>Sir Robert Holms</hi> went out to fall upon the <hi>Dutch Smyrna</hi> Fleet: and the ſecond <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars breaking out upon this, I forbore going to Sea that Summer, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to my Brother in <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi> But growing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſtaying aſhore, I lifted my ſelf on board the <hi>Royal Prince,</hi> Commanded by Sir <hi>Edward Sprague,</hi> and ſerved under him in the Year 1673. being the laſt of the <hi>Dutch War.</hi> We had three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that <hi>Summer;</hi> I was in two of them, but falling very ſick, I was put aboard an Hoſpital Ship a day or two before the third Engagement, ſeeing it at a diſtance only; and in this Sir <hi>Edward Sprague</hi> was kill'd. Soon after I was ſent to <hi>Harwich,</hi> with

                  <p>By this time the War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and with my health, I recovered my old Inclination for the Sea. A Neighbouring Gentleman, Colonel <hi>Hellier</hi> of <hi>Eaſt-Coker</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> my Native Pariſh, made me a ſeaſonable offer to go and manage a Plantation of his in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> under one Mr. <hi>Whalley:</hi> for which place I ſet out with Capt. <hi>Kent</hi> in the <hi>Content</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was then about 22 Years old, and had never been in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and therefore, leſt I might be trapann'd and ſold as a <hi>Servant</hi> after my arrival in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> I agreed with Capt. <hi>Kent</hi> to work as a Seaman for my Paſſage, and had it under his hand to be cleared at our firſt arrival. We ſailed out of the River <hi>Thames</hi> in the beginning of the Year 1674. and meeting with favourable Winds in a ſhort time got into the Trade-wind, and went merrily along, ſteering for the Iſland <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> When we came in ſight of it Captain <hi>Kent</hi> told his Paſſengers, if they would pay his Port-Charges he would anchor in the Road, and ſtop whilſt they got refreſhment: But the Merchants not caring to part with their Money, he bore away, directing his Courſe towards <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Iſland that appeared in our view was St. <hi>Lucia.</hi> 'Tis diſtant from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> about 30 Leagues, and very wealthy in large Timber Trees fit for all uſes. For this reaſon 'tis often viſited by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> who ſtock themſelves here with Rollers, &amp;c. They have endeavoured to ſettle an <hi>Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi> there, but hitherto unſucceſsfully, becauſe of the <hi>Caribbe-Indians.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1674</label> but at certain Seaſons of the Year they viſit the Iſlands for their Pleaſure. <hi>Barbadoes</hi> was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much frequented by them; but ſince the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſettled there they have been forced to abandon it, and content themſelves in their Sea-Voyages, or with ſuch Iſlands only as are not poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Europeans;</hi> except where they have hopes of conquering; as they have done at St. <hi>Lucia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Near the Main where theſe <hi>Indians</hi> live, lies <hi>Tabago,</hi> which, when it was firſt ſettled by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> was much infeſted by them. Theſe <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as I have heard, had formerly Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on moſt of the <hi>Caribbe-Iſlands;</hi> and in their <hi>Sea Voyages</hi> did uſe to remain 3 Weeks or a Month at a time on an Iſland, and then remove to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo viſit moſt of them before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Main.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Vincent</hi> is another of theſe Iſlands lying near St. <hi>Lucia:</hi> We paſſed between them; and ſeeing a ſmoke on St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> we ſent our Boat aſhore there. Our men found ſome of the <hi>Caribbe-Indians,</hi> and bought of them Plantains, Bonanoes, Pine-Apples, and Sugar-Canes; and returning aboard again, there came with them a Canoa with 3 or 4 of the <hi>Indians.</hi> Theſe often repeated the word <hi>Captain Warner,</hi> and ſeemed to be in ſome diſquiet about him.

Where conforming himſelf to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms he became one of their Captains, and roved from one Iſland to another, as they did. About this time the <hi>Caribbees</hi> had done ſome ſpoil on our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations at <hi>Antego:</hi> and therefore Governour <hi>Warner</hi>'s Son by his Wife took a Party of Men and went to ſuppreſs thoſe <hi>Indians;</hi> and came to the Place where his Brother the <hi>Indian-Warner</hi> lived. Great ſeeming Joy there was at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but how far it was real the Event ſhewed; for the <hi>Engliſh Warner</hi> providing plenty of Liquor, and inviting his half Brother to be merry with him, in the midſt of his Entertainment ordered his Men upon a ſignal given to murder him and all his <hi>Indians;</hi> which was accordingly performed. The Reaſon of this inhumane Action is diverſly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſome ſay that this <hi>Indian Warner</hi> committed all the ſpoil that was done to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for that Reaſon his Brother kill'd him and his Men. Others that he was a great Friend to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and would not ſuffer his Men to hurt them, but did all that lay in his power to draw them to an amicable Commerce; and that his Brother kill'd him, for that he was aſhamed to be Related to an <hi>Indian.</hi> But be it how it will, he was call'd in queſtion for the Murder, and forced to come home to take his Tryal in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Such perfidious Doings as theſe, beſide the Baſeneſs of them, are great hindrances of our gaining an Intereſt among the <hi>Indians.</hi>

From hence we ſteered away for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in a ſhort time, bringing with us the firſt News they had of the Peace with the Dutch.</p>
                  <p>Here, according to my Contract, I was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſcharged; and the nevt day I went to the <hi>Spaniſh Town,</hi> call'd <hi>Sant' Jago de la Vega;</hi> where meeting with Mr. <hi>Whalley,</hi> we went together to Colonel <hi>Hellier</hi>'s Plantation in 16 <hi>Mile-Walk.</hi> In our way thither we paſt through <hi>Sir Tho. Muddiford</hi>'s Plantation, at the <hi>Angells,</hi> where at that time were <hi>Otta</hi> and <hi>Cacao Trees</hi> growing; and fording a pretty large River, we paſt by the ſide of it 2 or 3 Miles up the Stream, there being high Mountains on each ſide, The way to 16 <hi>Mile-Walk</hi> was formerly a great deal about, round a large Mountains; till Mr. <hi>Cary Hellier,</hi> the Colonel's Brother, found out this way. For being deſirous of making out a ſhorter cut, he and ſome others coaſted along the River, till they found it run between a Rock that ſtood up perpendicularly ſteep on each ſide, and with much difficulty they climbed over it. But a Dog that belonged to them, finding a hole to creep through the Rock, ſuggeſted to them that there was a hollow Paſſage; and he clear'd it by blowing up the Rock with Gunpowder, till he had made a way through it broad enough for a Horſe with a Pack, and high enough for a Man to ride through. This is called the <hi>Hollow Rock.</hi> Some other Places he levell'd, and made it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different good Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>He was a very ingenious Gentleman, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs had he lived, he might have propagated ſome advantagious Arts on that Iſland. He was once endeavouring to make <hi>Salt Petre</hi> at the <hi>Angells,</hi> but did not bring it to Perfection. Whether the

                  <p>I liv'd with Mr. <hi>Whalley</hi> at 16 <hi>Mile-walk</hi> for almoſt ſix Months, and then entred my ſelf into the Service of one Captain <hi>Heming,</hi> to manage his Plantation at <hi>St. Anns,</hi> on the North ſide of the Iſland, and accordingly rode from <hi>St. Jago de la Vega</hi> toward <hi>St. Anns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Road has but ſorry accommodations for Travellers. The firſt night I lay at a poor Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Hut, at the foot of <hi>Mount Diabolo</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> ſide of it, where for want of Clothes to cover me in the Night I was very cold when the Land-wind ſprang up.</p>
                  <p>This Mountain is part of the great Ridge that runs the length of the Iſland from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt;</hi> to the Eaſt 'tis call'd the <hi>Blew Mountain,</hi> which is higher than this. The next day croſſing Mount <hi>Diabolo,</hi> I got a hard Lodging at the Foot of it on the North ſide; and the third day after arrived at Captain <hi>Heming</hi>'s Plantation.</p>
                  <p>I was clearly out of my Element there, and therefore as ſoon as Captain <hi>Heming</hi> came thither I diſingaged my ſelf from him, and took my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage on Board a Sloop to <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Statham,</hi> who uſed to trade round the Iſland, and touched there at that time.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Port-Royal</hi> I ſailed with one Mr. <hi>Fiſhook,</hi> who traded to the North ſide of the Iſland, and ſometimes round it: and by theſe coaſting <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages</hi> I came acquainted with all the Ports and Bays about <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and with all their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; as alſo with the Benefit of the Land and Sea-winds.

                  <p>We ſailed from <hi>Port-Royal</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1675. in Company with Capt. <hi>Wren</hi> in a ſmall <hi>Jamaica</hi> Bark, and Capt. <hi>Johnſon</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of a Ketch belonging to <hi>New-England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Voyage is all the way before the Wind, and therefore Ships commonly ſail it in 12 or 14 Days; Neither were we longer in our Paſſage; for we had very fair Weather, and touch'd no where till we came to <hi>Triſt</hi> Iſland in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> which is the only place they go to. In our way thither we firſt ſailed by little <hi>Caimanes,</hi> leaving it on our Larboard ſide, and <hi>Key Monbrack,</hi> which are two ſmall Iſlands, lying South of <hi>Cuba.</hi> The next Land we ſaw was the Iſle of <hi>Pines;</hi> and ſteering ſtill Weſterly, we made <hi>Cape Corien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> and ſailing on the South ſide of <hi>Cuba,</hi> till we came to <hi>Cape Antonio,</hi> which is the Weſt end of it, we ſtretched over towards the <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> and fell in with <hi>Cape Catoch,</hi> which is in the extream part of that Promontory towards the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Land trends from this Cape one way South about 40 Leagues till you come to the Iſland <hi>Cozumel,</hi> and from thence it runs S. W. down into the Bay of <hi>Honduras.</hi> About 10 Leagues from <hi>Cape Catoch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and <hi>Cozumel,</hi> lies a ſmall Iſland called by the Spaniards <hi>Key-Muger,</hi> or <hi>Womens-Iſland;</hi> becauſe 'tis reported that when they went firſt to ſettle in theſe

                  <p>About 3 Leagues from <hi>Cape Catoch,</hi> and juſt againſt it is a ſmall Iſland called <hi>Loggerhead-Key;</hi> probably becauſe it is frequently viſited by a ſort of Turtle ſo call'd: near this Iſland we always find a great Ripling, which Seamen call the Rip-raps. This Cape, tho' it appears to be part of the Main, yet is divided from it by a ſmall Creek, ſcarce wide enough for a Canoa to paſs through, though by it 'tis made an Iſland. This I have been credibly informed of by ſome, who yet told me that they made a ſhift to paſs it in a Canoa.</p>
                  <p>The Cape is very low Land by the Sea, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher as you go further from the ſhore. It is all over-grown with Trees of divers ſorts, eſpecially Logwood; and therefore was formerly much frequented by the <hi>Jamaica</hi> Men, who came thither in Sloops to load with it, till all the Logwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees near the Sea were cut down; but now 'tis wholly abandoned, becauſe the Carriage of it to the ſhore repuires more labour, than the cutting, logging and chipping. Beſides they find better Wood now in the Bays of <hi>Campeachy</hi> and <hi>Honduras,</hi> and have but a little way to carry it; not about 300 Paces, when I was there: whereas at <hi>Cape Catoch</hi> they were forc'd to carry it 1500 Paces before they left that Place.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cape Catoch</hi> we coaſted along by the ſhore, on the North ſide of <hi>Jucatan</hi> towards <hi>Cape Condecedo.</hi> The Coaſt lies neareſt Weſt. The diſtance between theſe two Capes is about 80 Leagues. The ſhore lies pretty level without any viſible Points or Bendings in the Land. It is Woody by the ſhore, and full of ſandy Bays and lofty Mangroves.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place of note to the Weſt of <hi>Cape Catoch,</hi> is a ſmall Hill by the Sea, call'd the <hi>Mount,</hi> and

I was never aſhore here, but have met with ſome well acquainted with the Place, who are all of opinion that this Mount was not natural, but the Work of Men: And indeed it is very probable this place has been inhabited; for here are a great many large Ciſterns, ſuppoſed to have been made for the receiving of Rain-water, for there are no freſh Springs to be found here, the Soil being all ſandy and very ſalt. So that, as I have been credibly informed by an intelligent Perſon, the Spaniards do fetch of it to make Salt-Petre. He alſo told me, that being once there in a Privateer, and landing ſome Men on the Bay, they found about 100 Packs of this Earth bound up in Palmeto leaves; and a <hi>Spaniſh Mulatto</hi> to guard it. The Privateers at firſt ſight of the Packs were in hopes there had been Maiz or Indian Corn in them, which they then wanted; but opening them they found nothing but Earth; and examining the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto</hi> for what uſe it was, he ſaid to make Powder, and that he expected a Bark from <hi>Compeachy</hi> to fetch it away. He further told me, that taſting of it he found it very ſalt; as all the Earth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts was. So that 'tis not improbable that thoſe Ciſterns were made for the carrying on of Salt-Petre Work. But whatever was the deſign at firſt, it is now wholly laid aſide: for there is no uſe made of them; neither are there any Inhabitants near this Place.</p>
                  <p>Between the <hi>Mount</hi> and <hi>Cape Condecedo,</hi> cloſe by the Sea, are many little Spots of Mangrove Trees, which at a diſtance appear like Iſlands: but coming nearer, when other lower Trees appear, it ſhews like ragged and broken Ground; but at laſt all the Land preſents it ſelf to your view very even.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> The next place of note on this Coaſt is <hi>Rio de la Gartos,</hi> almoſt in the mid-way between <hi>Cape Cotoch</hi> and <hi>Cape Condecedo.</hi> This alſo is a very remarkable Place; for here are 2 Groves of High Mangroves, one on each ſide the River, by which it may be known very well. The River is but ſmall, yet deep enough for Canoas. The Water is good, and I know not any other Brook of freſh River on all the Coaſt from <hi>Cape Catoch</hi> till within 3 or 4 Leagues of <hi>Campeachy</hi> Town.</p>
                  <p>A little to the Eaſt of this River is a Fiſh-Range, and a ſmall Indian Hutt or two within the Woods; where the Indian Fiſhers who are ſubject to the Spaniards, lye in the Fiſhing-Seaſons, their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Families being farther up in the Country. Here are Poles to hang their Nets on, and Barbecues to dry their Fiſh. When they go off to Sea, they fiſh with Hook and Line about 4 or 5 Leagues from the ſhore, for <hi>Snappers</hi> and <hi>Gropers,</hi> which I have already deſcribed in my Voyage round the World. Chap. 4. pag. 91.</p>
                  <p>Since the Privateers and Logwood-ſhips have ſailed this way, theſe Fiſher-men are very ſhy, having been often ſnapp'd by them. So that now, when they are out at Sea, if they ſee a Sail, they preſently ſink their Canoas even with the edge of the Water; for the Canoas when they are full of Water, will ſink no lower, and they themſelves lye juſt with their heads above Water, till the Ship which they ſaw is paſs'd by or comes nigh. I have ſeen them under ſail, and they have thus vaniſhed on a ſudden. The Fiſh which they take near the Shore with their Nets, are <hi>Snooks, Dog-Fiſh,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Tarpoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tarpom</hi> is a large ſcaly Fiſh, ſhaped much like a Salmon, but ſomewhat flatter. 'Tis of a dull Silver Colour, with Scales as big as a Half Crown. A large <hi>Tarpom</hi> will weight 25 or 30 Pound. 'Tis good ſweet wholſome Meat, and the Fleſh ſolid and firm.

The Nets for this purpoſe are made with ſtrong double Twine, the Meſhes 5 or 6 Inches ſquare. For if they are too ſmall, ſo that the Fiſh be not intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein, he preſently draws himſelf a little back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then ſprings over the Net: Yet I have ſeen them taken in a Sain made with ſmall Meſhes in this manner.

Beſides theſe we had three Men in a Canoa, in which they mov'd ſide-ways after the Net; and many of the Fiſh in ſpringing over the Net, would fall into the Canoa: And by theſe means we ſhould take two or three at every draught.

This <hi>Key</hi> is not above 40 Paces long, and 5 or 6 broad, having only a little crooked Tree growing on it, and for that reaſon it is called <hi>One-Buſh-Key.</hi> It ſeems to be only a heap of Shells, for the Iſland is covered with them. The greateſt part are Oyſter-ſhells. There are a great many Oyſters-banks in this Lagune, and the adjacent Creeks; but none afford better, either for largeneſs or taſte, than the Bank about this Iſland. In the wet Seaſon the Oyſters as well of <hi>One-Buſh-Key</hi> as other Places here, are made freſh by the Freſhes running out of the Country: But in the dry time they are ſalt enough.

We had none but ſmall Arms to fire at their drinking Healths, and therefore the noiſe was not very great at a diſtance; but on Board the Veſſels we were loud enough till all our Liquor was ſpent: We took no Money for it, nor expected any; for Log-wood was what we came hither for, and we had of that in lieu of our Commodities after the rate of 5 Pound <hi>per</hi> Tun, to be paid at the Place where they cut it; and we went with our Long-boat to fetch ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.

This was accordingly done in a trice, and in leſs than an hour after the Breez ſprung up freſh, and we put right before the Wind. We had this advantage in it, that all the Sail we had did us ſervice; while on the contrary, thoſe who chaſed us, being three

At laſt the Wind freſhing on by the coming of a Tornado, we gained conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of them; ſo they fired a Gun and left their Chaſe, but we kept on crouding till Night; and then clapp'd on a Wind again and ſaw no more of them.</p>
                  <p>In about a Fortnight after this, we were got as far to the Eaſt as <hi>Rio de la Gartos,</hi> and there overtook us a ſmall <hi>Barmudoes</hi> Boat belonging to <hi>Jamaica</hi> which had not been above ten days come from <hi>Triſt,</hi> who ſailed much better than we did. Therefore our Merchant went on board of Her, for he ſaw we were like to have a long Paſſage; and Proviſion began to be ſcarce already, which he could not ſo well brook as we. Our Courſe lay all along againſt the Trade-wind.</p>
                  <p>All the hopes that we had was a good North, this being the only time of the Year for it: and ſoon after we ſaw a black Cloud in the N. W. (which is a ſign of a North, but of this more in my Diſcourſe of Winds) for two days, Morning and Evening. The third day it roſe apace and came away very ſwiftly. We preſently provided to receive it by furling all but our Main-ſail; intending with that to take the advantage of it. Yet this did us but little ſervice; for after an Hours time, in which it blew freſh at N. W. the Cloud went away, and the Wind came about again at E. N. E. the uſual trade in theſe Parts. We therefore made uſe of the Sea and Land-Breezes, as we had done before; and being now as high as the before mentioned <hi>Fiſhing Banks</hi> on the North of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> we ſo ordered our Buſineſs, that with the Land-winds we run over to the Banks; and while it was calm between the Land-winds and Sea-Breez, we put out our Hooks and Lines and

                  <p>Soon after this we got as high as the Mount, and then ſtood off about 30 Leagues from Land, in hopes to get better to Windward there, than near the ſhore; becauſe the Wind was at E. S. E. and S. E. by E. a freſh gale: continuing ſo 2 or 3 days. We ſteered off to the North, expecting a Sea-Breez at E. N. E. and the third day had our deſire. Then we tack'd and ſteered in again S. E. for the ſhore of <hi>Jucatan.</hi> Our Ketch, as I ſaid, was a heavy Sailer, eſpecially on a Wind: for ſhe was very ſhort; and having great round Bows, when we met a Head-Sea, as now, ſhe plunged and laboured, not going a-head, but tumbling like an Egg-ſhell in the Sea. It was my fortune to be at the Helm from 6 a Clock in the Evening till 8. The firſt 2 Glaſſes ſhe ſteered very ill; for every Sea would ſtrike her dead like a Log; then ſhe would fall off 2 or 3 Points from the Wind, though the Helm was a Lee; and as ſhe recovered, and made a little way, ſhe would come again to the Wind, till another Sea ſtruck her off again. By that time 3 Glaſſes were out the Sea became more ſmooth; and then ſhe ſteered very well, and made pretty freſh way through the Water. I was ſomewhat ſurprized at the ſudden Change, from a rough Sea to a ſmooth; and therefore looked over-board 2 or 3 times; for ſhe ſteered open on the Deck, and it being very fair Weather, all our Men were layn down on the Deck and fallen aſleep. My Captain was juſt behind me on the Quarter Deck faſt aſleep too, for neither he nor they dreaded any Danger, we being

                  <p>But while I was muſing on the ſudden alteration of the Sea, our Veſſel ſtruck on a Rock, with ſuch force that the Whipſtaff threw me down on my back: This frighted me ſo much that I cryed out, and bad them all turn out, for the Ship ſtruck. The ſurge that the Ship made on the Rock, avvakened moſt of our Men, and made them aſk, What the matter vvas? But her ſtriking a ſecond time, ſoon anſvvered the Queſtion, and ſet us all to vvork for our Lives. By good fortune ſhe did not ſtick, but kept on her way ſtill, and to our great comfort, the water was very ſmooth, otherwiſe we muſt certainly have been loſt; for we very plainly ſavv the Ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us: ſo we let go our Anchor, in 2 fathom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, clean White Sand: When our Sails vvere furled, and a ſufficient ſcope of Cable veered out, our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being yet in amaze, vvent into his Cabin, and moſt of us with him to vievv his draught, and we ſoon found vve were fallen foul of the <hi>Alcranes.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Alcranes</hi> are 5 or 6 low ſandy Iſlands, lying in the Lat. of about 23d.

All of them have good Anchoring on the Weſt ſides, where you may ride in what depths you pleaſe, from 10 to 2 Fathom Water, clean ſandy Ground. On ſome there are a fevv lovv Buſhes of Burton-vvood, but they are moſtly Barren and Sandy, bearing nothing but only a little Chicken-Weed; neither have they any freſh Water.

The Boobies being moſt numerous, have the greateſt portion of Land. The Egg-Birds, tho' they are many, yet being but ſmall, take up but little room to the reſt: Yet in that little part which they inhabit, they are ſole Maſters, and not diſturbed by their Neighbours. All three ſorts are very tame, eſpecially the Boobies, and ſo thick ſettled, that a Man cannot paſs through their Quarters, without coming within reach of their Bills, with which they continually peckt at us. I took notice that they ſat in Pairs; and therefore at firſt thought them to be Cock and Hen; but upon ſtriking at them, one flew away from each place, and that which was left behind ſeemed as malicious as the other that was gone. I admired at the boldneſs of thoſe that did not fly away, and uſed ſome ſort of violence to force them, but in vain; for indeed theſe were young Ones, and had not yet learned the uſe of their Wings, tho' they were as big and as well feathered as their Dams, only their Feathers were ſomething whiter and freſher. I took notice that an old one, either the Cock or Hen, always ſat with the young to ſecure them; for otherwiſe theſe fowls would prey on each other, the ſtrong on the weak, at leaſt thoſe of a different Kind would make bold with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: the Men-of-War-Birds as well as the Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies left Guardians to the Young, when they went off to Sea, leſt they ſhould be ſtarved by their Neighbours; for there were a great many old and lame Men-of-War-Birds that could not fly off to Sea to ſeek their own Food. Theſe did not inhabit among their Conſorts, but were either expelled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or elſe choſe to lye out at ſome diſtance

If one of theſe lame Birds found a young Booby not guarded, it preſently gave him a good poult on the back with his Bill to make him diſgorge, which they will do with one ſtroak, and it may be caſt up a Fiſh or two as big as a Mans Wriſt; this they ſwallow in a trice, and march off, and look out for another Prize. The ſound Men-of-War will ſometimes ſerve the old Boobies ſo off at Sea. I have ſeen a Man-of-War fly directly at a Booby, and give it one blow, which has cauſed it to caſt up a large Fiſh, and the Man-of-War flying directly down after it, has taken it in the Air, before it reach'd the Water.</p>
                  <p>There are abundance of Fiſh at ſome diſtance from theſe Iſlands, by which the Fowls inhabiting here, are daily ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>The Fiſh near the Iſland, are Sharks, Sword-Fiſhes, and Nurſes; all three ſorts delighting to be near ſandy Bays; thoſe that I ſaw here were but of a ſmall ſize, the Sword-Fiſh not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot long; neither were the Sharks much longer, and the Nurſes about the ſame length. The Nurſe is juſt like a Shark, only its Skin is rougher, and his uſed for making the fineſt Raſps. Here are many Seals: they come up to ſun themſelves only on two or three of the Iſlands, I don't know whether exactly of the ſame kind with thoſe in colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, but, as I have noted in my former Book, they always live where there is plenty of Fiſh.</p>

One Reaſon why we would have gone out to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was, becauſe from our Main-top we ſaw the Iſlands to the Southward of us, and being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, knew not whether we might find among them a Channel to paſs through; our ſecond reaſon was the hopes of making a better ſlant in for the ſhore, if we could weather the Eaſt end of the Riff. In order to this we weighed Anchor, keeping down by the ſide of the Riff till we were at the Weſt end of it, which was about a League from where we Anchored: then we ſtood off to the North, and there kept plying off and on to weather the Eaſt end of the Riff, three Days; but not being able to effect it, by reaſon of a ſtrong Current, ſetting to the N. W. we ran back again to the Weſt end of the Riff, and ſteered away for the Iſlands. There we Anchored and lay three or four days, and viſited moſt of them, and found plenty of ſuch Creatures, as I have already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Though here was great ſtore of ſuch good Food and we like to want, yet we did neither ſalt any, nor ſpend of it freſh to ſave our Stock. I found them all but one Man averſe to it, but I did heartily wiſh them of another mind, becauſe I dreaded wanting before the end of the Voyage; a hazard which we needed not to run, there being here ſuch plenty of Fowls and Seals, (eſpecially of the later) that the Spaniards do often come hither to make Oyl of their Fat; upon which account it has been viſited by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-men

By good fortune ſhe was not damnified: but his Company being but ſmall, and ſo deſpairing of ſetting her afloat again, they fell to contriving how to get away; a very difficult taſk to accompliſh, for it was 24 or 25 Leagues to the neareſt Place of the Main, and above 100 Leagues to <hi>Triſt,</hi> which was the next Engliſh Settlement.

We kill'd none of them (vvhich vve might eaſily have done) though Food began to be ſhort vvith us; indeed had it been in the Months of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> vve might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have gotten Turtle, for they frequent this Iſland ſome Years as much as they do little <hi>Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</hi> We ſtayed here but 3 or 4 Hours, and ſteered back for <hi>Pines,</hi> intending there to hunt for Beef or Hog, of both vvhich there is in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſecond day in the morning vve fell in vvith the Weſt-end of <hi>Pines,</hi> and running about 4 or 5 miles Northvvard, vve anchored in 4 fathom Water clean Sand, about 2 mile from the ſhore, and right againſt a ſmall Creek through the Mangroves into a vvide Lagune.</p>
                  <p>The Iſles of <hi>Pines</hi> lies on the South-ſide, tovvards the Weſt-end of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and is diſtant from it 3 or 4 Leagues. Cape <hi>Corientes</hi> on <hi>Cuba</hi> is five or ſix Leagues to the Weſtward of the Iſle of <hi>Pines.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pines</hi> and <hi>Cuba</hi> are many ſmall woody Iſlands ſcattered here and there, with Channels for Ships to paſs between; and by report there is good ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring near any of them. <hi>Jamaica</hi> Sloops do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſs through between <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Pines,</hi> when they are bound to Windward, becauſe there the Sea is always ſmooth: They are alſo certain to meet good Land-winds; beſides they can anchor

There is alſo plenty of Fiſh of many ſorts, but if they are not provided with Hooks, Lines, or Harpoons, or any other Fiſhing-Craft, nor meet with any Turtlers, <hi>Cuba</hi> will afford them Suſtenance of Hog or Beef. The great inconvenience of going in the inſide of <hi>Pines</hi> between it and <hi>Cuba,</hi> proceeds from a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon of about 40 Soldiers at Cape <hi>Corientes,</hi> who have a large Periago, well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Oars and Sails, and are ready to launch out, and ſeize any ſmall Veſſel, and ſeldom ſpare the Lives as well as the Goods of thoſe that fall into their Hands, for fear of telling Tales. Such Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies are frequently practiſed not only here, but alſo in ſeveral other places of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and that too with ſuch as come to Trade with their Country-men. The Merchants and Gentry indeed are no way guilty of ſuch Actions, only the Soldiers and Raſcality of the People; and theſe do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conſiſt of Mulatoes or ſome other ſort of Copper-colour'd Indians, who are accounted very Barbarous and Cruel.</p>
                  <p>The Iſle of <hi>Pines</hi> is about 11 or 12 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad. The Weſt end of it is low Mangrovy-Land; and within, which is a Lagune of about 3 or 4 Miles wide running to the Eaſtward, but how far I know not, with a ſmall Creek of 2 or 3 Foot Water, reaching to the Sea. The Lagune it ſelf is ſo ſhallow, eſpecially near the Iſland, that

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> you cannot bring a Canoa within 20 or 30 Paces of the ſhore. The South ſide of the Iſland is low, flat, and rocky; the Rocks are perpendicularly ſteep towards the Sea, ſo that there is no Anchoring on that ſide; but the Weſt-end very good in ſandy Ground. The Body of the Iſland is high Land, with many little Hills incompaſſing a high Pike or Mountain ſtanding in the middle. The Trees that grow here are of divers ſorts, moſt of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me. Red Mangroves grow in the low ſwampy Land againſt the Sea, but on the firm hilly part Pine-Trees are moſt plentiful. Of theſe here are great Groves of a good height and bigneſs, ſtreight and large enough to make Top-maſts, or ſtanding Maſts for ſmall Veſſels; at the Weſt end there is a pretty big River of freſh Water, but no coming at it near the Sea for red Mangroves, which grow ſo thick on both ſides of it, that there is no getting in among them.</p>
                  <p>The Land-Animals are Bullocks, Hogs, Deer, &amp;c. Here are ſmall Savannahs for the Bullocks and Deer to feed in, as well as Fruit in the Woods for the Hogs: Here are alſo a ſort of Racoons or Indian Conies, and in ſome places plenty of Land-Turtle, and Land-Crabs of two ſorts, white and black: Both of them make holes in the Ground like Conies, where they ſhelter themſelves all day, and in the Night come out to feed; they will eat Graſs, Herbs, or ſuch Fruit as they find under the Trees: The Manchaniel Fruit, which neither Bird nor Beaſt will taſte, is greedily devoured by them, without doing them any harm. Yet theſe very Crabs that feed on Manchaniel, are venemous both to Man and Beaſt that feeds on them, though the others are very good Meat; the white Crabs are the largeſt ſort; ſome of them are as big as a Mans two Fiſts joyned together; they are ſhaped like Sea-Crabs, having one large Claw, wherewith they will pinch very

Theſe white-ones built in wet ſwampy dirty Ground near the Sea, ſo that the Tide waſhes in their Holes; but the black Crab is more cleanly, delighting to live in dry Places, and makes its Houſe in ſandy Earth: black Crabs are commonly fat and full of Eggs; they are alſo accounted the better Meat, tho' both ſorts are very good.</p>
                  <p>Here are alſo a great many Alligators and Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles that haunt about this Iſland, and are ſaid to be the moſt daring in all the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> I have heard of many of their Tricks; as that they have followed a Canoa, and put their Noſes in over the Gunnal, with their Jaws wide open, as if ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Men in it: and that when they have been aſhore in the Night near the Sea, the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles have boldly come in among them, and made them run from their Fire, and taken avvay their Meat from them. Therefore when Privateers are hunting on this Iſland, they always keep Sentinels out to vvatch for theſe ravenous Creatures, as duly as they do in other Places for fear of Enemies, eſpecially in the Night, for fear of being devoured in their ſleep.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards of <hi>Cuba</hi> have here ſome Craules, <hi>i. e.</hi> Herds of Hogs, with a few Indians or Mula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes to look after them: Here are alſo Hunters that gain a livelihood by killing wild Hog and Beef.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland is reported to be very wet. I have heard many ſay, that it rains here more or leſs every day in the Year; but this I ſuppoſe is a miſtake, for there fell no rain about us, ſo long as we ſtayed

                  <p>We were no ſooner at an Anchor, but five of us went aſhore, leaving only the Cook and Cabbin-Boy aboard: We had but two bad fowling Pieces in the Ship; thoſe we took with us, with a deſign to kill Beef and Hog. We went into the Lagune, where we found Water enough for our Canoa, and in ſome Places not much to ſpare; when we were got almoſt over it, we ſaw 8 or 10 Bulls and Cows feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſhore cloſe by the Sea. This gave us great Hopes of good ſucceſs. We therefore rowed away aſide of the Cattle, and landed on a ſandy Bay, about half a mile from them: there we ſaw much footing of Men and Boys; the Impreſſions ſeemed to be about 8 or 10 days old, we ſuppoſed them to be the Track of Spaniſh Hunters. This troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us a little, but it being now their <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> we concluded that they were gone over to <hi>Cuba</hi> to keep it there, ſo we went after our Game; the Boatſwain and our Paſſenger <hi>Will. Wooders</hi> having one Gun, and perſuming on their ſkill in ſhooting, were permitted to try their fortune with the Cattle that we ſaw before we landed, while the Captain and my ſelfwith our own Gun ſtruck up directly into the Woods. The fifth Man, whoſe genius led him rather to fiſh than hunt, ſtayed in the Canoa: and had he been furniſhed with a Harpoon, he might have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more Fiſh than we did Fleſh, for the Cattle ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our two Men before they came nigh them, ran away; after that our Men rambled up into the Country to ſeek for ſome other Game.</p>
                  <p>The Captain and I had not gone half a Mile before we came among a Drove of near 40 great and ſmall wild Hogs. The Captain firing, wounded one of them, but they all ran away; and though we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Blood a good way, yet did not come up with him, nor with any other to get a ſecond ſhot;

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> however becauſe there was ſuch a great track of Hogs in the Woods, we kept beating about, being ſtill in hopes to meet with more Game before Night, but to no purpoſe, for we ſaw not one more that Day. In the Evening we returned to our Boat weary and vext at our ill ſucceſs. The Boatſwain and his Conſort were not yet returned, therefore we ſtayed till 'twas dark, and then went aboard without them: the next Morning betimes we went aſhore again, as well to try our fortune at Hunting, as to recover our two Men which we thought might now be returned to the place where they landed; but not ſeeing them, the Captain and I went again out to Hunt, but came back at Night with no better ſucceſs than before; neither did we ſee one Beef or Hog, though much track all the day. This day he that look'd to the Boat kill'd a young Sword-fiſh with the Boat-hook; there were a great many of them, as alſo Nurſes and Dog-fiſh, playing in ſhole Water; he had alſo diſcover'd a ſtream of Freſh Water, but ſo incloſed with thick red Mangroves, that 'twas impoſſible to fill any in Caſk; we could ſcarce get a little to drink. Our two Men that went out the day before, were not yet returned; therefore when 'twas dark we went aboard again, being much perplex'd for fear of their falling into the hands of the Spaniſh Hunters; if we had been certain of it, we would have ſail'd preſently, for we could not expect to redeem them again, but might have been taken our ſelves, either by them, or by the Cape Soldiers before mentioned. Indeed theſe thoughts about their danger and our own, kept me waking all Night. However the next Morning betimes we went aſhore again, and before we got into the Lagune we heard a Gun fired, by which we knew that our Men were arrived; ſo we fired another in anſwer and rowed away as faſt as we could to fetch them, deſigning to fail as ſoon as we came aboard; for by the flattering South and S. W.

W. therefore we did not ſee the black Cloud there, which is a ſure Prognoſtick of a North; when we came aſhore we found our two Men. They kill'd a Hog the firſt day, but loſing their way, were forced to march like Tigres all the next Day to get to us, and threw away moſt of their Meat to lighten themſelves, yet 'twas Night before they got to the ſide of the Lagune; and then being 3 or 4 Miles, ſtill from us, they made a fire and roaſted their Meat, and having fill'd their Bellies; lay down to ſleep, yet had ſtill a ſmall Pittance left for us. We preſently returned aboard, and feaſted on the remains of the Roaſtmeat, and being now pretty full, got up our Anchor and ſtood away to the South, coaſting along by the Iſland: and doubling the S. W. Point, we ſteered away E. S. E. We had the Wind, when we weighed at Weſt a moderate Gale, but veering about to the North, got at N. W. By that time we got to the South Weſt Point of <hi>Pines,</hi> and it now blew a fierce Gale, and held thus two Days, and then came to the N. N. W. blowing hard ſtill, and from thence to the North: then we edged away S. E. for it blew hard, and we could not bring her nearer the Wind. From the N. it came about to the N. N. E. then we knew than the heart of it was broke, however it blew hard ſtill: then it came about to the N. E. and blew about 4 hours, and ſo by degrees dyed away and edged more Eaſterly, till it came to the E. by N. and there it ſtood. We were in good hopes while the North continued, to have gotten to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> before it ceaſed, and were ſorry to find our ſelves thus diſappointed; for we could not ſee the Iſland, though we judged we could not be far from it; at Noon we had a good obſervation, and found ourſelves in the Latiude of the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>We now had not one bit of any kind of Food

All the Seamen but my ſelf, were for going to the South Keys, alledging that our Ship being ſuch a dull Sailer would never get to Wind-ward without the help of Sea and Land Breezes, which we could not expect at ſuch a diſtance as we were, being out of the ſight of any Land: and that it was probable that in three or four days time we might be among the South Keys, if we would put for it; and there we ſhould find Proviſion enough, either Fiſh or Fleſh. I told them that the Craft was in Catching it, and it was as probable that we might get as little Food in the Souths Keys, as we did at <hi>Pines,</hi> where, though there was plenty of Beefs and Hogs, yet we could not tell how to get any: beſides we might be ſix or ſeven days in getting to the Keys; all which time we muſt of neceſſity faſt, which if 'twere but two or three days, would bring us ſo low, that we ſhould be in a weak condition to Hunt. On the contrary, if they would agree to beat a day or two longer for the Iſland <hi>Jamaica,</hi> we might in all probability ſee, and come ſo near it, that we might ſend in our Boat and get Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion from thence, though we could not get in to Anchor: for by all likelihood we were not ſo far from the Iſland, but that we might have ſeen it, had it been clear; and that the hanging of the Clouds ſeemed to indicate to us, that the Land was obſcured by them. Some of them did acquieſce with me in my Opinion; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'twas agreed to put away for the South Keys, and accordingly we veered out our Sheets, trimm'd our Sails, and ſteered away N. N. W. I was ſo much disſatisfied, that I turned into my Cabbin, and told them we ſhould be all ſtarved.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'twas by meer accident that our Food laſted ſo long; for we carried two Barrels of Beef out with us to ſell, but 'twas ſo bad that none would buy it; which proved well for us: for after our own Stock was ſpent, this ſupplied us. We boiled every day two pieces of it; and becauſe our Peaſe were all eaten, and our Flour almoſt ſpent, we cut our Beef in ſmall bits after 'twas boiled, and boiled it again in Water, thicken'd with a little Flour, and ſo eat it altogether with Spoons. The little Pieces of Beef were like Plums in our Hodg-podg. Indeed 'twas not fit to be eaten any other way; for tho' it did not ſtink, yet it was very unſavory and black, without the leaſt ſign of Fat in it: Bread and Flour being ſcarce with us, we could not make Dough-boys to eat with it. But to proceed, I had not lain in my Cabbin above three Glaſſes, before one on the Deck cryed out, <hi>Land! Land!</hi> I was very glad at the News, and we all immediately diſcerned it very plain. The firſt that we ſaw was High-land, which we knew to be <hi>Blewfields-Hill,</hi> by a bending or Saddle on the Top, with two ſmall Heads on each ſide. It bore N. E. by E. and we had the Wind at E. therefore we preſently clapp'd on a Wind, and ſteered in N. N. E. and ſoon after we ſaw all the Coaſt, being not above 5 or 6 Leagues from it. We kept jogging on all the Afternoon, not ſtriving to get into any particular place; but where we could fetch, there we were reſolved to Anchor: The next day being pretty near the ſhore, between <hi>Blemfields Point,</hi> and <hi>Point-Nigrill,</hi> and having the Wind large enough to fetch the latter, we ſteered away directly thither; and ſeeing a ſmall Veſſel about two Leagues N.

Now Captain <hi>Johnſon</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> being bound again into the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> I took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of going a Paſſenger with him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſpend ſome time at the Logwood Trade; and accordingly provided ſuch neceſſaries as were required about it <hi>(viz.)</hi> Hatchets, Axes, Macheats, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Long Knives) Saws, Wedges, &amp;c. a Pavillion to ſleep in, a Gun with Powder and Shot, &amp;c. and leaving a Letter of Attorney with Mr. <hi>Fleming,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> as well to diſpoſe of any thing that I ſhould ſend up to him, as to remit to me what I ſhould order, I took leave of my Friends and Imbarked.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of <hi>Feb.</hi> 75, ---6. We ſailed from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and with a fair Wind and Weather, ſoon got as far as <hi>Cape Catoch;</hi> and there met a pretty ſtrong North, which laſted two days. After that the Trade ſettled again at E. N. E. which ſpeedily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us to <hi>Triſt</hi> Iſland. In a little time I ſetled my ſelf in the Weſt Creek of the Weſt Lagune with ſome old Logwood-Cutters, to follow the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them. But I ſhall proceed no farther with the Relation of my own Affairs, till I have

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> given a deſcription of the Country, and its Product, with ſome particulars of the Logwood-Cutters; their hunting for Beef, and making Hides, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I have in my former Voyage deſcribed the Coaſt from Cape <hi>Catoch</hi> to Cape <hi>Condecedo.</hi> Therefore I ſhall now begin where I then left off, and following the ſame method, proceed to give ſome Account of the Sea-coaſt of the Bay of <hi>Campeachy;</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently qualified for it by many little Excurſions that I made from <hi>Triſt</hi> during my Abode in theſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi> is a deep bending of the Land, contained between Cape <hi>Condecedo</hi> on the Eaſt, and a Point ſhooting forth from the High-Land of St. <hi>Martins</hi> on the Weſt. The diſtance between theſe two place is about 120 Leagues, in which are many large and navigable Rivers, wide Lagunes, &amp;c. Of all which I ſhall treat in their order, as alſo of the Land on the Coaſt; its Soil, Product, &amp;c. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome Obſervations concerning the Trees, Plants, Vegetables, Animals, and Natives of the Country.</p>
                  <p>From Cape <hi>Condecedo</hi> to the <hi>Salinas</hi> is 14 or 15 Leagues; the Coaſt runs in South: It is all a Sandy Bay between, and the Land alſo within is dry and ſandy, producing only ſome ſcrubbed Trees. Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way between theſe two Places you may dig in the Sand above High-water Mark, and find very good freſh Water.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Salina</hi> is a fine ſmall Harbour for Banks; but there is not above 6 or 7 Foot Water; and cloſe by the Sea, a little within the Land, there is a large Salt Pond, belonging to <hi>Campeachy</hi> Town, which yields abundance of Salt. At the time when the Salt Kerns, which is in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Country are ordered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to give their attendance, to rake it aſhore, and gather it into a great Pyramidal Heap, broad below and ſharp at the top,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0799400300:240"/>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> like the Ridge of a Houſe; then covering it all over with dry Graſs and Reeds, they ſet Fire to it; and this burns the out-ſide Salt to a hard black Cruſt: The hard Cruſt is afterwards a defence againſt the Rains that are now ſettled in, and preſerves the Heap dry even in the wetteſt Seaſon. The <hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe buſineſs I have told you, is to gather the Salt thus into Heaps, wait here by turns all the Kerning Seaſon, not leſs than 40 or 50 Families at a time; yet here are no Houſes for them to lie in, neither do they at all regard it; for they are relieved by a freſh ſupply of <hi>Indians</hi> every Week; and they all ſleep in the open Air, ſome on the Ground, but moſt in very poor Hammocks faſtned to Trees or Poſts, ſtuck into the Ground for that purpoſe. There Fare is no better than their Lodging; for they have no other Food, while they are here, but Tartilloes and Poſole. Tartilloes are ſmall Cakes made of the Flour of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn; and Poſole is alſo <hi>Indian</hi> Corn boiled, of which they make their Drink. But of this more hereafter, when I treat of the Natives and their manner of Living. When the Kerning Seaſon is over, the <hi>Indians</hi> march home to their ſettled Habitations, taking no more care of the Salt. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> who are owners of the Ponds, do frequently ſend their Barks hither for Salt, to load Ships that lye in <hi>Campeachy</hi> Road; and afterwards tranſport it to all the Ports in the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> eſpecially to <hi>Aluarado</hi> and <hi>Tompeck,</hi> two great Fiſhing Towns: and I think that all the Inland Towns thereabouts, are ſupplied with it; for I know of no other Salt Ponds on all the Coaſt, beſides this and thoſe before mentioned. This <hi>Salina</hi> Harbour was often viſited by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Logwood-Cutters in their way from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to <hi>Triſt.</hi> And if they found any Barks here, either light or laden, they made bold to take and ſell both the Ships and the <hi>Indian</hi> Sailors that belonged to them. This they

This was done openly, for the Ships were carried into the <hi>Havanna,</hi> there ſold, and the Men impriſoned without any Redreſs.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Salinas</hi> to <hi>Campeachy</hi> Town, is about 20 Leagues; the Coaſt runs S. by W. The firſt 4 Leagues of it, along the Coaſt, is drowned Mangrove-Land, yet about two Mile South of the <hi>Salina,</hi> about 200 Yards from the Sea, there is a freſh Spring, which is viſited by all the <hi>Indians</hi> that paſs this way either in Bark or Canoa; there being no Water beſides near it; and there is a ſmall dirty Path leads to it thro' the Mangroves; after you are paſt theſe Mangroves, the Coaſt riſeth higher with many ſandy Bays, where Boats may conveniently land, but no freſh Water till you come to a River near <hi>Campeachy</hi> Town. The Land further along the Coaſt is partly Mangrovy but moſt of it dry Ground, and not very fruitful; producing only a few ſcrubbed Buſhes: and there is no Logwood growing on all this Coaſt, even from Cape <hi>Catoch</hi> to <hi>Campeachy</hi> Town.</p>
                  <p>About ſix Leagues before you come to <hi>Campeachy,</hi> there is a ſmall Hill called <hi>Hina,</hi> where Privateers do commonly Anchor and keep Sentinels on the Hill, to look out for Ships bound to the Town: There is plenty of good Fire-wood, but no Water; and in the Surf of the Sea, cloſe by the ſhore, you find abundance of Shell-fiſh, called by the <hi>Engliſh, Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofs,</hi> becauſe the under part or Belly of the Fiſh is flat, and ſomewhat reſembling that Figure in ſhape and Magnitude; but the Back is round like a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;

                  <p>There are three ſmall low ſandy Iſlands, about 25 or 26 Leagues from <hi>Hina,</hi> bearing North from it, and 30 Leagues from <hi>Campeachy.</hi> On the South ſide of theſe Iſlands there is good Anchorage; but neither Wood nor Water: and as for Animals, we ſaw none, but only great numbers of large Rats and Plenty of Boobies, and Men-of-War-Birds. Theſe Iſlands are call'd the <hi>Triangles,</hi> from the Figure they make in their Poſition. There are no other at any diſtance from the ſhore, but theſe and the Alcranies, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former Chapter, in all this Coaſt that I have ſeen.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Hina</hi> to <hi>Campeachy,</hi> as I have ſaid before, is about 6 Leagues. <hi>Campeachy</hi> is a fair Town, ſtanding on the ſhore in a ſmall bending of the Land; and is the only Town on all this Coaſt, even from Cape <hi>Catoch</hi> to <hi>La vera Cruz,</hi> that ſtands open to the Sea. It makes a fine ſhew, being built all with good ſtone. The Houſes are not high, but the Walls very ſtrong; the Roofs flattiſh, after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion, and covered with Pantile. There is a ſtrong Cittadel or Fort at one end, planted with many Guns, where the Governour reſides with a ſmall Garriſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. Though this Fort commands the Town and Harbour, yet it has been twice taken. Firſt by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Mims;</hi> who about the Year 1659. having ſummoned the Governour, and afterwards ſtayed 3 days for an Anſwer before he landed his Men, yet then took it by Storm, and that only with ſmall Arms. I have been told that when he was adviſed by the <hi>Jamaica</hi> Privateers, to take it by Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem in the Night, he replyed, that he ſcorned to ſteal a Victory; therefore when he went againſt it, he gave them warning of his Approach, by his

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> Drums and Trumpets; yet he took the Fort at the firſt Onſet, and immediately became Maſter of the Place.</p>
                  <p>It was taken a ſecond time by <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Privateers, about the Year 1678, by ſurprize. They landed in the Night about two Leagues from the Town, and marching into the Country, lighted on a Path that brought them thither. The next Morning near Sun-riſing, they entred the Town, when many of the Inhabitants were now ſtirring in their Houſes, who hearing a noiſe in the Street, looked out to know the Occaſion; and ſeeing armed Men marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Fort, ſuppoſed them to be ſome Soldiers of their own Garriſon, that were returned out of the Country for about a Fortnight or 3 Weeks before, they had ſent out a Party to ſuppreſs ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> then in Rebellion; a thing very common in this Country. Under favour of this Suppoſition, the Privateers marched through the Streets, even to the Fort, without the leaſt Oppoſition. Nay, the Townſ-People bad them <hi>Good Morrow;</hi> and Congratulated their ſafe return; not diſcovering them to be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till they fired at the <hi>Sentinels</hi> on the Fort-wall, and peſently after began a furious Attack; and turning two ſmall Guns, which they found in the Parade, againſt the Gates of the Fort, they ſoon made themſelves Maſters of it. The Town is not very rich, though as I ſaid before, the only <hi>Sea-port</hi> or all this Coaſt. The chiefeſt Manufacture of the Country is Cotton-Cloth; this ſerves for cloathing the <hi>Indians,</hi> and even the poorer ſort of <hi>Spaniard</hi> wear nothing elſe. It is uſed alſo for making Sails for Ships, and remitted to other parts for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides Cotton-Cloth, and Salt fetched from the <hi>Salinas,</hi> I know of no other vendible Commodity exported hence. Indeed formerly this place was the Scale of the whole <hi>Logwood-Trade;</hi> which is there

                  <p>The place where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did then cut it, was at a River called <hi>Champeton,</hi> about 10 or 12 Leagues to Leeward of <hi>Campeachy</hi> Town; the Coaſt from thence South, the Land pretty high and rocky. The Native <hi>Indians</hi> that lived hereabouts, were hired to cut it for a Ryal a Day, it being then worth 90, 100 or 110<hi>l. per Tim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Engliſh had taken <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and began to cruiſe in this Bay, they found many Barks laden with it, but not knowing its value then, they either ſet them adrift or burned them, ſaving only the Nails and Iron work; a thing now uſual among the Privateers; taking no notice at all of the Cargo; till Capt. <hi>James,</hi> having taken a great Ship laden with it and brought her home to <hi>England,</hi> to fit her for a Privateer; beyond his Expectation, ſold his Wood at a great rate; tho' before he valu'd it ſo little that he burned of it all his Paſſage home. After his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the Engliſh viſiting this Bay, found out the Place where it grew, and if they met no Prize at Sea, they would go to <hi>Champeton</hi> River, where they were certain to find large Piles cut to their Hand, and brought to the Sea ſide ready to be ſhipp'd off. This was their Common Practice; till at the laſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent Soldiers thither to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Depredations.</p>
                  <p>But by this time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> knew the Trees, as growing; and underſtanding their value, began to rummage other Coaſts of the Main, in ſearch of it, till, according to their deſire, they found large Groves of it, firſt at Cape <hi>Catoch;</hi> (which, as I have ſaid before, was the firſt Place where they ſettled to Logwood-cutting) and loaded many Veſſels from thence to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and other Places. But it growing ſcarce there, they found out the Lagune of <hi>Triſt</hi> in the

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1675</label> Bay of <hi>Campeachy;</hi> where they followed the ſame Trade, and have ever ſince continued it, even to the time of my being here: But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>From the River <hi>Champeton</hi> to <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> is about 18 Leagues; the Coaſt S. S. W. or S. W. by S. Low-land with a ſandy Bay, againſt the Sea, and ſome Trees by the ſhore, with ſmall <hi>Savannahs,</hi> mixt with ſmall ſhrubby Woods within Land all the way. There is only one River between <hi>Champeton</hi> and <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> called <hi>Port Eſcondedo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Port-Royal</hi> is a broad entrance into a Salt <hi>Lagune,</hi> of 9 or 10 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 wide, with 2 Mouths, one at each end. This Mouth of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> hath a Barr, whereon there is 9 or 10 Foot Water. Within the Barr it is deep enough, and there is good Anchoring on either ſide. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is about a Mile over, and two Miles in length; it hath fair ſandy Bays on each ſide, with ſmooth Landing.</p>
                  <p>Ships commonly anchor on the Weather or Eaſt ſide next <hi>Champeton,</hi> both for the convenience of ſome Wells they dug on the Bays by the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers and Log-wood-Cutters, as alſo to ride more out of the Tide, which here runs very ſtrong. This Place is remarkable enough, becauſe from hence the Land trends away Weſt, and runs ſo for about 65 or 70 Leagues farther.</p>
                  <p>On the Weſt ſide of this Harbour is a low Iſland, call'd by Us <hi>Port-Royal-Iſland;</hi> which makes one ſide of the Mouth, as the Main does the other: It is about 2 Miles wide and 3 Leagues long, running Eaſt and Weſt. The Eaſt end of this Iſland is ſandy and pretty clear of Woods, with ſome Graſs, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall prickly Bur, no bigger than a Grey Pea, which renders it very troubleſome to thoſe that walk bare-foot, as the Bay-Men often do. There are ſome Buſhes of Burton-wood: and a little further to the Weſt grow large <hi>Sapadillo-Trees,</hi> whoſe Fruit is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0799400300:246"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> long and very pleaſant. The reſt of the Iſland is more woody, eſpecially the North ſide, which is full of white Mangrove cloſe to the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>On the Weſt ſide of this Iſland, is another ſmall low Iſland, called <hi>Triſt,</hi> ſeparated from the former by a ſmall Salt Creek, ſcarce broad enough for a Canoa to paddle through.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iſland Triſt</hi> is in ſome Places three Miles wide, and about 4 Leagues in length; running E. and W. The Eaſt end is ſwampy and full of white Mangroves; and the South ſide much the ſame: The Weſt part is dry and ſandy, bearing a ſort of long Graſs, growing in Tufts very thin. This is a ſort of Savannah, with ſome large <hi>Palmeto-Trees</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it. The North ſide of the Weſt end is full of <hi>Coco-Plum Buſhes,</hi> and ſome Grapes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Coco-Plum Buſh</hi> is about 8 or 9 Foot high, ſpreading out into many Branches. Its Rind black and ſmooth, the Leaves oval and pretty large, and of a dark Green. The Fruit is about the bigneſs of a Horſe-Plum, but round; ſome are black, ſome white, others reddiſh: The Skin of the Plum is very thin and ſmooth; the inſide white, ſoft and woolly, rather fit to ſuck than bite, incloſing in the Middle a large ſoft Stone. This Fruit grows commonly in the Sand near the Sea; and I have taſted ſome that have been ſaltiſh; but they are commonly ſweet and pleaſant enough, and accounted very wholſom.</p>
                  <p>The Body of the <hi>Grape-Tree</hi> is about two or three Foot in Circumference, growing 7 or 8 Foot high, then ſends forth many Branches, whoſe Twigs are thick and groſs; the Leaves are ſhaped much like an Ivy Leaf, but broader and more hard; the Fruit is as big as an ordinary Grape, growing in Bunches or Cluſters among the Twigs all over the Tree; it is black when ripe, and the inſide reddiſh, with a large hard Stone in the middle. This Fruit is very pleaſant and wholſom, but of little ſubſtance, the Stones
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0799400300:247"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> being ſo large: The Body and Limbs of the Tree are good Fewel, making a clear ſtrong Fire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often uſed by the Privateers to harden the Steels of their Guns when faulty.</p>
                  <p>The Animals of this <hi>Iſland</hi> are, <hi>Lizards, Guanoes, Snakes</hi> and <hi>Deer:</hi> Beſide the common ſmall <hi>Lizard,</hi> there is another ſort of a large kind, call'd a <hi>Lyon-Lizard:</hi> This Creature is ſhap'd much like the other, but almoſt as big as a Man's Arm, and it has a large Comb on its Head; when it is aſſaulted it ſets its Comb up an end; but otherways it lies down flat: Here are two or three ſorts of Snakes: ſome very large, as I have been told.</p>
                  <p>At the Weſt end of the <hi>Iſland</hi> cloſe by the Sea, you may dig in the Sand 5 or 6 foot deep, and find good freſh Water: There are commonly Wells ready made by Seamen to water their Ships; but they ſoon fill up, if not cleared; and if you dig too deep, your Water will be Salt. This <hi>Iſland</hi> was ſeldom clear of Inhabitants when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> viſited the Bay for Logwood; for the biggeſt Ships did always ride here in 6 or 7 fathom Water cloſe by the ſhore; but ſmaller Veſſels ran up 3 Leagues farther to <hi>One-Buſh-Key,</hi> of which in my former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Mouth or Entrance into this Lagune is between <hi>Triſt,</hi> and <hi>Beef-Iſland,</hi> and is about 3 mile wide. It is ſhoal without, and only two Channels to come in: The deepeſt Channel on the Spring Tide, has 12 Foot Water. It lyes near the middle of the Mouth; hard Sand on the Bar; the Weſt Channel is about 10 Foot Water; and lyes pretty near <hi>Beef-Iſland:</hi> you run in with the <hi>Sea-Breez,</hi> and ſound all the way; taking your ſounding from <hi>Beef-Iſland</hi> ſhore. The bottom is ſoft Oaz, and its ſhoals gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually. Being ſhot in within <hi>Beef-Iſland</hi> Point, you will have three Fathom; then you may ſtand over towards <hi>Triſt,</hi> till you come near the ſhore, and

This Lagune is call'd by the <hi>Spaniards, Laguna Termina,</hi> or the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gune of Tides, becauſe they run very ſtrong here. Small Veſſels, as Barks, Periagoes or Canoas may ſail thro' this Lagune, from one Mouth to the other, or into ſuch Creeks, Rivers, or ſmaller Lagunes, as empty themſelves into this, of which here are many: The firſt of note on the Eaſt part of this Lagune, as you come in at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> is the River <hi>Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This River, though but ſmall, yet is big enough for <hi>Periagoes</hi> to enter. It diſembogues on the South ſide near the middle of the Lagune. There was formerly an <hi>Indian</hi> Village named <hi>Summaſenta,</hi> near the Mouth of the River; and another large <hi>Indian</hi> Town, called <hi>Chucquebul,</hi> 7 or 8 Leagues up in the Country. This latter was once taken by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers; by whom I have been informed, that there were about two thouſand Families of Indians in it, and two or three Churches, and as many Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Friers, though no white Men beſide. The Land near this River yields plenty of Logwood.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Summaſenta</hi> River to <hi>One-Buſh-Key</hi> is 4 or 5 Leagues, the ſhore running Weſt.

                  <p>Ths wild <hi>Pine</hi> is a Plant ſo called, becauſe it ſomewhat reſembles the Buſh that bears the Pine: they are commonly ſupported, or grow from ſome Bunch, Knot or Excreſcence of the Tree, where they take root, and grow upright. The Root is ſhort and thick, from whence the Leaves riſe up in folds one within another, ſpreading off at the top: They are of a good thick Subſtance, and about 10 or 12 Inches long. The out-ſide Leaves are ſo compact as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rain-water as it falls. They will hold a Pint and a half, or a Quart; and this Water refreſhes the Leaves and nouriſhes the Root. When we find theſe <hi>Pines,</hi> we ſtick our Knives into the Leaves juſt above the Root, and that lets out the Water, which we catch in our Hats, as I have done many times to my great relief.</p>

Among theſe the Logwood-Trees thrive beſt, and are very plentiful; this being the moſt proper Soil for them: for they do not thrive in day Ground; neither ſhall you ſee any growing in rich black mould. They are much like our White-Thorns in <hi>England;</hi> but generally a great deal bigger:

The leaves are ſmall and ſhaped like the Common White-Thorn-Leaf, of a paliſh Green. We always chuſe to cut the old black-rinded Trees; for theſe have leſs ſap, and require but little pains to chip or cut it. The ſap is white, and the heart red: The heart is uſed much for dying; therefore we chip off all the white ſap, till we come to the heart; and then it is fit to be tranſported to <hi>Europe.</hi> After it has been chip'd a little while, it turns black; and if it lyes in the Water it dyes it like Ink; and ſometimes it has been uſed to write with. Some Trees are 5 or 6 Foot in Circumference: and theſe we can ſcarce cut into Logs ſmall enough for a Man's Burthen, without great Labour; and therefore are forced to blow them up. It is a very ponderous ſort of wood, and burns very well, making a clear ſtrong fire, and very laſting. We always harden the Steels of our Fire-Arms, when they are faulty, in a <hi>Logwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,</hi> if we we can get it, but otherways, as I ſaid before, with <hi>Burton wood</hi> or the Grape-tree. The true <hi>Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> I think grows only in the Country of <hi>Jucatan;</hi> and even there but only in ſome Places near the Sea. The chiefeſt places for it are either here or at Cape <hi>Catoch,</hi> and on the <hi>South</hi> ſide of <hi>Jucatan</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Honduras.</hi> There are other ſorts of Wood much like it in colour, and uſed for dying alſo; ſome more eſteemed, others of leſſer value.

And at <hi>Tunqueen,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> there is alſo ſuch another ſort: I have not heard of any more in any part of the World. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Land as you go farther from the Sea riſeth ſtill ſomewhat higher; and becomes of a more plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Mould: There the Trees are generally of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort; growing higher and taller than the Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvood-trees or any near them: Beyond this, you ſtill enter in large Savannahs of long Graſs, two or three Miles wide; in ſome Places much more.</p>
                  <p>The Mould of the Savannahs is generally black and deep, producing a courſe ſort of ſedgy Graſs: In the latter end of the dry time, vve ſet fire to it, which runs like Wild-fire, and keeps burning as long as there is any Fewel; unleſs ſome good ſhovver of Rain put it out: Then preſently ſprings up a new green Crop, vvhich thrives beyond all belief.

                  <p>The Animals of this Country are, Horſes, Bullocks, Deer, Warree, Precary, Squaſhes, Poſſums, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Ant Bears, Sloths, Armadilloes, Porcupines, Land-turtle, Guanoes, and Lizards of all kinds.</p>
                  <p>The Squaſh is a four-footed Beaſt, bigger than a Cat: Its Head is much like a Foxes; with ſhort Ears and a long Noſe. It has pretty ſhort Legs, and ſharp Claws, by which it will run up Trees like a Cat. The Skin is covered with ſhort fine yellowiſh Hair. The fleſh of it is good, ſweet, wholeſom Meat. We commonly ſkin and roaſt it; and then we call it Pig; and I think it eats as well. It feeds on nothing but good Fruit; therefore we find them moſt among the Sapadillo-Trees; This Creature never rambles very far: and being taken young, will become as tame as a Dog; and be as roguiſh as a Monkey.</p>
                  <p>The Monkies that are in theſe Parts are the uglieſt I ever ſaw. They are much bigger than a Hare, and have great Tails about two foot and a half long. The under ſide of their Tails is all bare, with a black hard ſkin; but the upper ſide, and all the Body is covered with courſe, long, black, ſtaring Hair. Theſe Creatures keep together 20 or 30 in a Company, and ramble over the Woods; leaping from Tree to Tree. If they meet with a ſingle Perſon they will threaten to devour him. When I have been alone I have been afraid to ſhoot them, eſpecially the firſt time I met them. They were a great Company dancing from Tree to Tree, over my Head; chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making a terrible Noiſe; and a great many grim Faces, and ſhewing Antick Geſtures.

The Tails of theſe Monkies ars as good to them as one of their Hands; and they will hold as faſt by them. If two or more of us were together they would haſten from us. The Females with their young ones are much troubled to leap after the Males; for they have commonly two: one ſhe carries under one of her Arms; the other ſits on her back, and claſps her tvvo fore Paws about her Neck. Theſe Monkies are the moſt ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len I ever met with; for all the Art we could uſe, would never tame them. It is a hard matter to ſhoot one of them, ſo as to take it; for if it gets hold with its Clavvs or Tail, it will not fall as long as one breath of Life remains. After I have ſhot at one and broke a Leg or an Arm, I have pitied the poor Creature to ſee it look and handle the vvounded Limb; and turn it about from ſide to ſide. Theſe Monkies are very rarely, or (as ſome ſay) never on the Ground.</p>

This Creature feeds on Ants; therefore you alvvays find them near an Ants Neſt or Path. It takes its Food thus. It lays its Noſe down flat on the Ground, cloſe by the Path that the Ants travel in, (whereof here are many in this Country) and then puts out his Tongue athwart the Path: the Ants paſſing forwards and

They ſmell very ſtrong of Ants, and taſte much ſtronger; for Ihave eaten of them. I have met with theſe Creatures in ſeveral places of <hi>America,</hi> as well as here; (<hi>i. e.</hi> in the <hi>Sambaloes</hi>) and in the <hi>South-Seas</hi> on the <hi>Mexican Continent.</hi>

This Creature feeds on Leaves, whether indifferently of all ſorts, or only on ſome particular kinds, I know not.

It takes them up 8 or 9 Minutes to move one of their Feet 3 Inches forward; and they move all their four Feet one after another, at the ſame ſlow rate; neither will ſtripes make them mend their pace; which I have tryed to do, by whipping them; but they ſeem inſenſible, and can neither be frighted, or provoked to move faſter.</p>

The Shell is joynted in the middle of the back; ſo that ſhe can turn the fore-part of her body about which way ſhe pleaſes. The Feet are like thoſe of a Land-Turtle, and it has ſtrong Claws wherewith it digs holes in the Ground like a Cony. The fleſh is very ſweet and taſtes much like a Land-Turtle.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Porcupine</hi> being a Creature well known, I'll paſs it in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>The Beaſts of prey that are bred in this Country are Tigre-Cats, and (as is reported by our Men) Lions. The Tigre-Cat is about the bigneſs of a Bull-Dug, with ſhort Legs, and a truſs Body, ſhaped much like a Maſtiff, but in all things elſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> its Head, the colour of its Hair, and the manner of its Preying, much reſembling the Tigre, only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs. Here are great numbers of them: They prey on young Calves or other Game; whereof here is plenty. And becauſe they do not want Food, they are the leſs to be feared. But I have wiſht them farther off, when I have met them in the Woods; becauſe their aſpect appears ſo very ſtately and fierce. I never did ſee any Lion in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but I have been informed by two or three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that they did ſee Lions here: But I am aſſured, that they are not numerous.</p>
                  <p>Here are a great many poiſonous Creatures in this Country; more particularly Snakes of divers ſorts, ſome yellow, ſome green, and others of a dun Colour, with black and yellowiſh ſpots. The yellow

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> Snake is commonly as big as the ſmall of a Man's Leg; and 6 or 7 Foot long. Theſe are a lazy ſort of Creatures; for they lye ſtill and prey on Lizards, Guanoes, or other ſmall Animals that come in their way.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that ſometimes they lirk in Trees: and that they are ſo mighty in ſtrength, as to hold a Bullock faſt by one of his Horns, when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to come ſo near that ſhe can twiſt her ſelf about the Limb of the Tree and the Horn at once. Theſe are accounted very good Meat by ſome, and are eaten frequently: I my ſelf have tryed it for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, but cannot commend it. I have heard ſome Bay-men report, that they have ſeen ſome of this kind here as big as an ordinary Man's Waſte; but I never ſaw any ſuch.</p>
                  <p>The green Snakes are no bigger about than a Man's Thumb, yet 4 or 5 Foot long: The Backs are of a very lively green colour, but their Bellies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to yellow. Theſe are commonly in Buſhes among the green Leaves, and prey upon ſmall Birds. This I have often ſeen, and was once in danger to be bit by one before I ſaw it: For I was going to take hold of a Bird that fluttered and cryed out juſt by me, yet did not fly away, neither could I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the reaſon till reaching out my hand, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the head of a Snake cloſe by it; and looking more narrowly, I ſaw the upper part of the Snake, about two or three Inches from his Head, twiſted about the poor Bird.</p>
                  <p>What they feed on beſides Birds I know not, but they are ſaid to be very venemous.</p>
                  <p>The dun coloured Snake is a little bigger than the green Snake, but not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot long; theſe we ſhould often ſee in and about our Huts; but did not kill them, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Mice, and are very nimble in chacing thoſe Creatures. Beſides Snakes, here are Scorpions

Theſe are Creatures ſomewhat reſembling Lizards, but larger; their Bodies about the thickneſs of a Man's Arm, having four ſhort Legs, and ſmall ſhort Tails; their colour a dark brown. Theſe Creatures live in old hollow Trunks of Trees, and are commonly found in wet ſwampy Ground, and are ſaid to be very poiſonous.</p>
                  <p>Here are alſo a ſort of Spiders of a prodigious ſize, ſome near as big as a Man's fiſt, with long ſmall Legs like the Spiders in <hi>England,</hi> they have two Teeth, or rather Horns an Inch and a half, or two Inches long, and of a proportionable bigneſs, which are black as Jett, ſmooth as Glaſs, and their ſmall end ſharp as a Thorn; they are not ſtrait but bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe Teeth we often preſerve. Some wear them in their Tobacco pouches to pick their Pipes. Others preſerve them for Tooth-Pickers, eſpecially ſuch as were troubled with the Toothach; for by report they will expel that pain, tho' I cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it of my own Knowledge. The backs of theſe Spiders are covered with a dark yellowiſh Down, as ſoft as Velvet. Some ſay theſe Spiders are vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; others not; whether is true I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>Tho' this Country be ſo often over-flown with Water; yet it ſwarms with Ants, of ſeveral ſorts; <hi>viz.</hi> great, ſmall, black, yellow, &amp;c. The great black Ant ſtings or bites almoſt as bad as a Scorpion; and next to this the ſmall yellow Ants bite is moſt painful; for their ſting is like a ſpark of fire; and they are ſo thick among the boughs in ſome places, that one ſhall be covered with them before he is aware. Theſe Creatures have Neſts on great Trees, placed on the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Limbs: ſome of their Neſts are as big as a Hogſhead; this is their Winter Habitation; for in the wet Seaſon they all repair to theſe their Cities:

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> Here they preſerve their Eggs. Ants-Eggs are as much eſteemed by the Planters in the Weſt-Indies for feeding their Chickens, as Great Oat-meal with us in <hi>England.</hi> In the dry Seaſon when they leave their Neſts, they ſwarm over all the Woodland; for they never trouble the Savannahs: You may then ſee great Paths made by them in the Woods of three or four Inches broad beaten as plain as the Roads in <hi>England.</hi> They go out light, but bring home heavy Loads on their backs, all of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and equal in bigneſs: I never obſerved any thing beſides pieces of green Leaves, ſo big that I could ſcarce ſee the Inſect for his Burthen; yet they would march ſtoutly, and ſo many ſtill preſſing after, that it was a very pretty ſight, for the Path lookt prefectly green with them. There was one ſort of Ants of a black Colour, pretty large, with long Legs; theſe would march in Troops, as if they were buſie in ſeeking ſomewhat; they were always in haſt, and followed their Leaders exactly, let them go whither they would; theſe had no beaten Paths to walk in, but rambled about like Hunters: Sometimes a Band of theſe Ants would happen to march through our Huts, over our Beds, or into our Pavilions, nay, ſometimes into our Cheſts; and there ranſack every part; and where-ever the foremoſt went, the reſt all came after: We never diſturbed them, but gave them free liberty to ſearch where they pleaſed; and they would all march off before night. Theſe Companies were ſo great, that they would be two or three hours in paſſing by, though they went very faſt.</p>
                  <p>The Fowls of this Country are Humming Birds, Black Birds, Turtle Doves, Pigeons, Parrots, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites, Quames, Correſoes, Turkies, Carrion Crows, Subtle Jacks, Bill Birds, Cockrecoes, &amp;c. The Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Bird is a pretty little feather'd Creature, no bigger than a great over-grown Waſp, with a black Bill no bigger than a ſmall Needle, and his Legs and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0799400300:263"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> Feet in proportion to his body. This Creature does not wave his Wings like other Birds when it flies, but keeps them in a continued quick motion like Bees or other Infects, and like them makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual humming Noiſe as it flies. It is very quick in motion, and haunts about Flowers and Fruit, like a Bee gathering Hony, making many near addreſſes to its delightful Objects, by viſiting them on all ſides, and yet ſtill keeps in motion, ſometimes on one ſide, ſometime on the other; as often rebounding a foot or two back on a ſudden, and as quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again, keeping thus about one Flower five or ſix minutes, or more. There are two or three ſorts of them, ſome bigger than others, but all very ſmall, neither are they coloured alike; the largeſt are of a blackiſh colour.</p>
                  <p>The Black Bird is ſomewhat bigger than ours in <hi>England;</hi> it has a longer Tail, but like them in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: They are ſometimes called Chattering Crows, becauſe they chatter like a Magpy.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Turtle Doves <hi>(viz.)</hi> white breſted Doves, dun coloured Doves, and ground Doves. The white breaſts are the biggeſt; they are of a blewiſh gray Colour with white Breaſts; theſe are fine, round and plump, and almoſt as big as a Pigeon. The next ſort are all over of a dun, leſſer than the former, and not ſo round. The ground Dove much bigger than a Sky-Lark, of a dull grey, very round and plump, and commonly runs in pairs on the ground, and probably thence have their name. The other two ſorts flie in pairs, and feed on Berries, which they commonly gather themſelves from the Trees where they grow; and all threes ſorts are very good Meat.</p>
                  <p>Pigeons are not very common here; they are leſs than our Wood Queſts, and as good food.</p>
                  <p>The Quam is as big as an ordinary Hen Turkey, of a blackiſh dun Colour; its Bill like a Turkeys;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0799400300:264"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> it flies about among the Woods; feeds on Berries, and is very good meat.</p>
                  <p>The Correſo is a larger Fowl that the Quam: The Cock is black, the Hen is of a dark brown. The Cock has a Crown of black Feathers on his Head, and appears very ſtately. Theſe live alſo on Berries, and are very good to eat; but their Bones are ſaid to be poiſonous; therefore we do either burn or bury them, or throw them into the Water for fear our Dogs ſhould eat them.</p>
                  <p>Carrion Crows are blackiſh Fowls about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ravens; they have bald Heads, and rediſh bald Necks like Turkeys; and therefore by Strangers that come newly from <hi>Europe,</hi> are often miſtaken for ſuch. Theſe live wholly on fleſh, (and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Carrion Crows:) There are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them; They are heavy, dull Creatures, and by their perching long at one place they ſeem to be very lazy: yet they are quick enough to find out their Prey; for when we hunt in the Woods or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannahs, as ſoon as we have killed a Beaſt, they will immediately flock about us from all parts, and in leſs than an hours time there will be two or three hundred, though at firſt there was not one to be ſeen. I have ſometimes admired from whence ſo many came ſo ſuddenly; for we never ſee above two or three at a place, before they come to feaſt on a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Carrion Crows are all over white, but their Feathers look as if they were ſullied: They have bald Heads and Necks like the reſt; they are of the ſame bigneſs and make; without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but in Colour; and we never ſee above one or two of theſe white ones at a time; and 'tis ſeldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have ſeen of the King Carrion Crows, but could not perceive them to be bigger than the reſt; neither were the black ones, their Companions, ſo unmannerly as to let them eat without Company; they are very vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious, and will diſpatch a Carcaſs in a Trice: For that reaſon the Spaniards never kill them, but fine any one that ſhall: And I think there is alſo an Act in <hi>Jamaica</hi> that prohibits their deſtruction; and the Logwood-Cutters, tho' under no ſuch obligation, yet are ſo zealouſly ſuperſtitious, that none will hurt them for fear of receiving ſome damage after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Subtle Jacks are Birds as big as Pidgeons; they are moſtly blackiſh; the tips of their Wing Feathers are yellowiſh, as are alſo their Bills. They have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and wonderful cunning way of building dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any others: Their Neſts hang down from the boughs of lofty Trees, whoſe Bodies are clean without limbs for a conſiderable height: The branches to which they faſten them, are thoſe that ſpread fartheſt out from the body; and the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of thoſe boughs are only uſed by them.

The Thread that faſtens the Neſt to the twig is made of long Graſs (as is alſo the Neſt it ſelf) very ingeniouſly twiſted together: It is but ſmall at the twig; but near the Neſt grows thicker. The Neſt has a hole in the ſide for the Bird to enter at, and 'tis very pretty to ſee twenty or thirty of them hanging round a Tree. They are all called by the Engliſh <hi>Subtle Jacks,</hi> becauſe of this uncommon way of building.</p>
                  <p>There are two or three ſorts of Bill-Birds, ſo called by the Engliſh, becauſe their Bills are almoſt as big as themſelves. The largeſt I ever ſaw are about the ſize of Engliſh Wood-peckers, and much like them: There are others of a ſmaller ſort; but they are not often met with, and I never ſaw many of them.</p>
                  <p>Cockrecoes are ſhort winged Birds, coloured like Partridge, but ſomewhat leſſer; neither are they ſo plump and round. They have long Legs, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to run on the Ground among Woods in ſwam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Places or near Creeks. They make a loud Noiſe Mornings and Evenings, and Anſwer one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very prettily; and they are extraordinary ſweet Meat.</p>
                  <p>The Water-Fowls are Duck and Mallard; Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lews, Herons, Crabcatchers, Pelicans, Cormorants, Fiſhing-Hawks, Men-of-War-Birds, Boobies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Ducks, <hi>viz.</hi> The Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy, the Whiſtling and the common Duck.

                  <p>Here are two ſorts of Curlews different in bigneſs and colour; the greater are as big as Turkeys, with long Legs and long crooked Bills, like a Snipes, in length and bigneſs proportionable to the Bulk of their Bodies: They are of a dark colour; their Wings black and white; their Fleſh black, but very ſweet and wholeſom: They are call'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> double Curlews, becauſe they are twice as big as the other ſort.</p>
                  <p>The ſmall Curlews are of a duſky brown, with long Legs and Bills like the former: their Fleſh is moſt eſteemed as being the ſweeteſt.</p>

                  <p>Crabcatchers are ſhaped and coloured like Herons, but they are ſmaller: They feed on ſmall Crabs no bigger than ones Tumb, of which there is great plenty.</p>
                  <p>Pelicans are large flat-footed Fowls, almoſt as big as Geeſe, and their Feathers in colour like them: they have ſhort Legs, long Necks, and their Bills are about two Inches broad and 17 or 18 long; the fore part of their Necks or Breaſts is bare, and covered with a ſoft, ſmooth, yet looſe Skin, like that about the Necks of Turkies: This Skin is of the colour of their Feathers, mixt with a dark and light grey, ſo axactly interwoven that it appears very beautiful. They are a very heavy Bird, and ſeldom fly far, or very high from the Water: They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſit on Rocks at ſome diſtance from the ſhore, where they may look about them. They ſeem to be very melancholy Fowls, by their perching all alone: they ſit as if they were ſleeping, holding their Heads upright, and reſting the ends of their

                  <p>Cormorants are juſt like young Ducks in ſhape, having ſuch Feet and Bills: They are black with white Breaſts, and live on ſmall Fiſh which they take near the ſhore, or on Worms which they get out of the Mud at low Water. They taſte very fiſhy, yet are indifferent good Meat, they being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fat.</p>
                  <p>Fiſhing Hawks are like our ſmalleſt ſort of Hawks in colour and ſhape, with ſuch Bills and Talons; They perch upon ſtumps of Trees or dry Limbs that hang over the Water about Creeks, Rivers or againſt the Sea: and upon ſight of any ſmall Fiſh near them, they Skim along juſt over them, and ſnatching up the Prey with their Talons, preſently riſe again without touching the Water with their Wings. They don't ſwallow the Fiſh whole as all other Fiſhing Fowls, that ever I ſaw do, but tear it with their Bills and eat it Piece-Meal.</p>
                  <p>The Lagunes, Creeks and Rivers are plentifully ſtored with great variety of Fiſh <hi>(viz.)</hi> Mullets, Snooks, Tenpounders, Tarpoms, Cavallies, Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cootas, Gar-fiſh, Stingrays, Spaniſh Mackril, with many others.</p>
                  <p>Tenpounders are ſhaped like Mullets, but are ſo full of very ſmall ſtiff Bones, intermixt with the Fleſh, that you can hardly eat them.</p>
                  <p>Parricootas are long Fiſh, with round Bodies like Mackril: They have very long Mouths and ſharp Teeth; they are about 8 or 10 Inches round, and three Foot and half long. They commonly haunt in Lagunes among Iſlands, or in the Sea near the ſhore. They are a floating Fiſh, and greedily take the Hook, and will ſnap at Men too in the Water. We commonly take them when we are under ſail, with a Hook towing after our Stern. They are firm well-taſted Fiſh; but 'tis dangerous

                  <p>Divers Perſons are of Opinion that theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are poyſonous in ſome Places only, and that but at ſome times of the Year. I know that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ſome have been injured by eating them, and that at different Seaſons of the Year; therefore Seamen commonly taſte the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before they venture any further; and if that has a biting taſte like Pepper, they eſteem the fiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom, but if not, they eat it: and yet I have found even this Rule fail too. I judge the Head and the Parts near it, to be chiefly venomous.</p>
                  <p>Gar-fiſh are round, but neither ſo big nor long as the former; but what is more peculiar, they have long bony Snouts, like the Sword-fiſh, only as the Sword-fiſhes Snout is flat, and indented like a Saw on each ſide; ſo on the contrary theſe have their Snouts like a Spear, round, ſmooth and ſharp at the end, and about a foot long. Theſe area ſort of floaty or Flying Fiſh: for they ſkip along a Foot or two above the Water, for the length of twenty or thirty Yards: then they juſt touch the edge of the Water, and ſpring forward ſo much farther, and them touch the Water, and ſpring forward again, a great many times before they ceaſe. They dart them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch a force that they ſtrike their Snout through the ſides of a Cotton-Tree Canoa; and we often fear that they will ſtrike quite through our very Bodies.—They are extraordinary ſweet Fiſh.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> The Ray is a flat Fiſh, like Skate, and I have ſeen three ſorts of them; <hi>viz.</hi> the Stingray, the Raſpray and the Whipray. The Stingray and Raſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray are much a like in ſhape; but the former has three or four ſtrong ſharp Prickles, near two Inches long, at the Root of its Tail, which are ſaid to be very venomous, but the reſt of his Skin is ſmooth. The Raſpray has a rough knotty Skin wherewith Raſps are made: the Skins of the largeſt are ſo rough, that the Spaniards in ſome Places grate their Caſſavy with them, which is a Root very common all over the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and of which the Spaniards and Engliſh frequently make their Bread; but the faireſt Skins are uſed to cover Surgeons Inſtrument Caſes, and other ſuch fine Things; but of late they are counterfeited. I have been told that in <hi>Turkey</hi> Aſſes Skins are ſtamped with ſmall hard Seeds, which gives them Impreſſions like Raſpray.</p>
                  <p>The Whipray differs from the other two ſorts, having a ſmall, but longer Tail, and ending with a Knob, ſhaped like a Harpoon. All theſe three ſorts are much about a Foot and half broad. There is yet another ſort of theſe flat Fiſh of the Whipray kind, but of a prodigious bigneſs; <hi>viz.</hi> three or four Yards ſquare, and their Tails as long: theſe we call Sea-Devils; they are very ſtrong Fiſh, and are ſometimes Gameſom; but they make an odd Figure when they leap out of the Water, tumbling over and over.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> Alligators are alſo in great numbers in all the Creeks, Rivers and Lagunes in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy;</hi> and I think that no part of the Univerſe is better ſtock'd with them.</p>
                  <p>The Alligator is a Creature ſo well known every where, that I ſhould not deſcribe it, were it not to give an Account of the difference between it and the Crocodile; for they reſemble each other ſo nearly in their ſhape and bulk, as alſo in their Natures, that they are generally miſtaken for the ſame Species; only the one ſuppoſed to be the Male, the other the Female: Whether they are ſo or not, the World may judge by the following Obſervations. As to their Bulk and length, I never ſaw any ſo large as ſome I have heard and read of; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my beſt Judgment, though I have ſeen Thouſands, I never met with any above ſixteen or ſeventeen Foot long, and as thick as a large Colt. He his ſhaped like a Lizard, of a dark brown colour, with a large head and very long Jaws, with great ſtrong Teeth, eſpecially two of a Remarkable Length, that grow out of, and at the very end of the under Jaw in the ſmalleſt part, on each ſide one; there are two holes in the upper Jaw to receive theſe, otherways he could not ſhut his Mouth. It has 4 ſhort Legs and Broad Claws, with a long Tail. The Head, Back and Tail is fenced with pretty hard Scales, joyned together with a very thick tough Skin: Over its Eyes there are two hard ſcally Knobs, as big as a Mans Fiſt, and from the Head to the Tail, along the Ridge of his Back 'tis full of ſuch knotty hard Scales, not like Fiſh-Scales, which are looſe, but ſo united to the Skin, that it is all one with it, and can't be taken aſunder, but with a ſharp Knife. From the Ridge of the Back down on the Ribs towards the Belly, (which is of a duſky yellow colour like a Frog) there are many of theſe Scales, but not ſo ſubſtantial nor ſo thick placed as the other.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0799400300:272"/>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> Theſe Scales are no hindrance to him in turning; for he will turn very quick, conſidering his length. When he goes on Land his Tail drags on the Ground.</p>
                  <p>The Fleſh ſmells very ſtrong of Muſk; eſpecially four Kernels or Cods that are always found about them, two of which grow in the Groin, near each Thigh; the other two at the Breaſt, one under each Fore-leg, and about the bigneſs of a Pullets Egg; therefore when we kill an Alligator, we take out theſe, and having dried them wear them in our Hats for a perfume. The Fleſh is ſeldom eaten but in caſe of Neceſſity, becauſe of it ſtrong ſcent.</p>
                  <p>Now the Crocodile hath none of theſe Kernels, neither doth his Fleſh taſte at all Muſky, therefore eſteemed better Food. He is of a yellow colour, neither hath he ſuch long Teeth in his under Jaw. The Crocodile's Legs alſo are longer, and when it runs on Land, it bears its Tail above the Ground, and turns up the tip of it in a round bow, and the Knots on the back are much thicker, higher and firmer than thoſe of the Alligator; and differ alſo as to the Places where they are found. For in ſome Parts, as here in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> are abundance of Alligators, where yet I never ſaw nor heard of any Crocodiles. At the Iſle <hi>Grand Caymanes,</hi> there are Crocodiles, but no Alligators. At <hi>Pines</hi> by <hi>Cuba,</hi> there are abundance of Crocodiles, but I cannot ſay there are no Alligators, tho' I never ſaw any there. Both Kinds are called <hi>Caymanes,</hi> by the Spaniards; therefore probably they may reckon them for the ſame. And I know of no other difference, for they both lay Eggs alike, which are not diſtinguiſhable to the Eye: They are as big as a Gooſe-Egg, but much longer, and good Meat; yet the Alligators Eggs taſte very muſky: They prey both alike in either Element,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> for they love Fleſh as well as Fiſh, and will live in either freſh or ſalt Water. Beſide theſe Creatures, I know none that can live any where, or upon any ſort of Food, like them. 'Tis reported, that they love Dogs Fleſh better than any other Fleſh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. This I have ſeen with my own Eyes, that our Dogs were ſo much afraid of them, that they would not very willingly drink at any great River or Creek where thoſe Creatures might lurk and hide themſelves, unleſs they were (through Neceſſity) conſtrained to it; and then they would ſtand five or ſix Foot from the brink of the Creek or River, and bark a conſiderable time before they would Adventure nearer; and then even at the ſight of their own Shadows in the Water, they would again retire to the Place from whence they came, and bark vehemently a long time; ſo that in the dry Seaſon, when there was no freſh Water but in Ponds and Creeks, we uſed to fetch it our ſelves and give it our Dogs; and many times in our Hunting, when we came to a large Creek that we were to paſs through, our Dogs would not follow us; ſo that we often took them in our Arms, and carried them over.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the fore-mentioned difference between the Alligator and Crocodile; the latter is accounted more fierce and daring then the Alligator: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we go to the Iſles of <hi>Pines</hi> or <hi>Grand Caymanes</hi> to hunt, we are often moleſted by them, eſpecially in the Night. But in the Bay of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy,</hi> where there are only Alligators, I did never know any Miſchief done by them, except by accident Men run themſelves into their Jaws.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> In the very height of the dry time ſeven or eight Men (Engliſh and Iriſh) went to a place called <hi>Pies Pond,</hi> on <hi>Beef-Iſland,</hi> to hunt. This Pond was never dry, ſo that the Cattle drew hither in ſwarms, but after two or three days hunting they were ſhy, and would not come to the Pond till Night, and then if an Army of Men had lain to oppoſe them, they would not have been debarr'd of Water. The Hunters knowing their Cuſtom, lay ſtill all Day, and in the Night viſited this Pond, and killed as many Beefs as they could. This Trade they had driven a Week, and made great profit. At length an Iriſh-man going to the Pond in the Night, ſtumbled over an Alligator that lay in the Path: The Alligator ſeized him by the Knee; at which the Man cries out, <hi>Help! help!</hi> His Conſorts not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the matter was, ran all away from their Huts, ſuppoſing that he was fallen into the Clutches of ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of whom they were afraid every dry Seaſon.

                  <p>THE Logwood-Cutters (as I ſaid before) inhabit the Creeks of the Eaſt and Weſt Lagunes, in ſmall Campanies, building their Huts cloſe by the Creeks ſides for the benefit of the Sea-Breezes, as near the Logwood Groves as they can, removing often to be near their Buſineſs: yet when they are ſettled in a good open Place, they chuſe rather to go half a Mile in their Canoas to work, than loſe that convenience. Tho' they build their Huts but ſlightly, yet they take care to thatch them very well with Palm or Palmeto Leaves, to prevent the Rains, which are there very violent, from ſoaking in.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> For their Bedding they raiſe a Barbecue, or wooden Frame 3 Foot and a half above Ground on one ſide of the Houſe; and ſtick up four Stakes, at each corner one, to faſten their Pavilions; out of which here is no ſleeping for Moſkitoes.</p>
                  <p>Another Frame they raiſe covered with Earth for a Hearth to dreſs their Victuals: and a third to ſit at when they eat it.</p>
                  <p>During the wet Seaſon, the Land where the Logwood grows is ſo overflow'd, that they ſtep from their Beds into the Water perhaps two Foot deep, and continue ſtanding in the wet all Day, till they go to. Bed again; but nevertheleſs account it the beſt Seaſon in the Year for doing a good days La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in.</p>
                  <p>Some fell the Trees, others ſaw and cut them into convenient Logs, and one chips off the Sap, and he is commonly a principal Man; and when a Tree is ſo thick, that after it has lodg'd, it remains ſtill too great a Burthen for one Man, we blow it up with Gun-powder.</p>
                  <p>The Logwood-Cutters are generally ſturdy ſtrong Fellows, and will carry Burthens of three or four hundred Weight; but every Man is left to his choice to carry what he pleaſeth, and commonly they agree very well about it: For they are contented to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour very hard.</p>
                  <p>But when Ships come from <hi>Jamaica</hi> with Rum and Sugar, they are too apt to miſ-pend both their Time and Money. If the Commanders of theſe Ships are Free, and treat all that come the firſt Day with Punch, they will be much reſpected, and every Man will pay honeſtly for what he drinks afterwards; but if he be niggardly, they will pay him with their worſt Wood, and commonly they have a ſtock of ſuch lay'd by for that purpoſe; nay, they will cheat them with hollow Wood fill'd with dirt in the middle and both ends plugg'd up

                  <p>In ſome places, eſpecially in the Weſt Creek of the Weſt Lagune, they go a hunting every <hi>Saturday</hi> to provide themſelves with Beef for the Week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>The Cattle in this Country are large and fat in <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April:</hi> At other times of the Year they are ſleſhy, but not fat, yet ſweet enough. When they have kill'd a Beef, they cut it into four Quarters, and taking out all the Bones, each Man makes a hole in the middle of his Quarter, juſt big enough for his Head to go through, then puts it on like a Frock, and trudgeth home; and if he chances to tire, he cuts off ſome of it, and flings it away.</p>
                  <p>It is a diverſion pleaſant enough, though not without ſome danger, to hunt in a Canoa; for then the Cattle having no other feeding Places than the ſides of the Savannahs, which are ſomewhat higher Ground than the middle, they are forced ſometimes to ſwim; ſo that we eaſily come to ſhoot them, when they are thus in the Water.</p>
                  <p>The Beaſt, when ſhe is ſo hard purſued that ſhe cannot eſcape, turns about and comes full tilt at the Canoa, and ſtriking her Head againſt the Prow, drives her back 20 or 30 Paces; then ſhe ſcampers away again: But if ſhe has received a wound, ſhe commonly purſues us till ſhe is knock'd down. Our chiefeſt care is to keep the head of the Canoa to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her; for if ſhe ſhould ſtrike againſt the broad ſide, it would indanger over-ſetting it, and conſequently wetting our Arms and Ammunition. Beſides, the Savannahs at this time ſwarm with Alligators, and therefore are the more dangerous on that account.</p>

Their chief Subſiſtence then is on young Cattle, or ſuch Carkaſſes as we leave behind us, which in the Dry Seaſon feed the Carrion-Crows; but now are a Prey to the Alligators. They remain here till the Water drains off from the Land; and then confine themſelves to the Stagnant Ponds; and when they are dry, they ramble away to ſome Creek or River.</p>
                  <p>The Alligators in this <hi>Bay</hi> are not ſo fierce as they are reported to be in other Places; for I never knew them purſue any Man, although we do frequently meet them; nay, they will flee from us: and I have drank out of a Pond in the dry time, that hath been full of them, and the Water not deep enough to cover their backs, and the compaſs of the Pond ſo ſmall that I could get no Water, but by coming within two Yards of the Alligators Noſe; they lying with their Heads towards mine as I was drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and looking on me all the while.

There were ſix in Company, who had a Hundred Tuns ready cut, log'd and chip'd, but not brought to the Creeks ſide, and they

                  <p>When I came hither, they were beginning to bring it to the Creek: And becauſe the Carriage is the hardeſt Work, they hired me to help them at the rate of a Tun of Wood <hi>per</hi> Month; promiſing me that after his Carriage was over, I ſhould ſtrike in to work with them, for they were all obliged in Bonds to procure this 100 Tuns jointly together, but for no more.</p>
                  <p>This Wood lay all in the Circumference of 5 or 600 Yards, and about 300 from the Creek-ſide in the middle of a very thick Wood, unpaſſable with Burthens. The firſt thing we did was to bring it all to one Place in the middle, and from thence we cut a very large Path to carry it to the Creeks ſide. We laboured hard at this Work 5 Days in the Week; and on Saturdays went into the Savannahs and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Beeves.</p>
                  <p>When we killed a Beef, if there were more than four of us, the Overplus went to ſeek freſh Game, whilſt the reſt dreſs'd it.</p>
                  <p>I went out the firſt Sunday and complyed very well with my Maſter's Orders, which was only to help drive the Cattle out of the Savannahs into the Woods, where two or three Men lay to ſhoot them: And having kill'd our Game, we marched Home with our Burthens.

I was ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at this; but however, I knew I ſhould find my way out, as ſoon as the Sun was a little lower. So I ſat down to reſt my ſelf; reſolving however to run no farther out of my way; for the Sun being ſo near the Zenith, I could not diſtinguiſh how to direct my Courſe. Being weary and almoſt faint for want of Water, I was forced to have recourſe to the Wild-Pines, and was by them ſupplied, or elſe I muſt have periſhed with Thirſt. About three a Clock I went due North, as near as I could judge, for the Savannah lay Eaſt and Weſt, and I was on the South ſide of it.</p>
                  <p>At Sun-ſet I got into the clear open Savannah, being about two Leagues wide in moſt Places, but how long I know not.

Here I found my ſelf four or five Mile to the Weſt of the Place where I ſtragled from my Companions.

But about a Mile farther, I ſpied ten or twelve Quams perching on the Boughs of a Cotton-Tree. Theſe were not ſhy, therefore I got well enough under them; and having a ſingle Bullet (but no ſhot) about me, fired at one of them, but miſs'd it, though I had before often kill'd them ſo. Then I came up with, and fired at 5 or 6 Turkies, but with no better ſucceſs. So that I was forced to march forward ſtill in the Savannah, toward the Creek; and when I came to the Path that led to it through the Woods, I found (to my great Joy) a Hat ſtuck upon a Pole: and when I came to the Creek I found another. Theſe were ſet up by my Conſorts, who were gone home in the Evening, as Signals that they would come and fetch me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſat down and waited for them; for although I had not then above three Leagues home by Water, yet it would have been very difficult, if not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to have got thither over Land, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe vaſt unpaſſable Thickets abounding every where along the Creeks ſide; wherein I have known ſome puzzled for two or three days, and have not advanced half a Mile, though they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured extreamly every day. Neither was I diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of my hopes; for within half an Hour after my arrival at the Creek, my Conſorts came, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Man his Bottle of Water, and his Gun, both to hunt for Game and to give me notice by Firing, that I might here them; for I have known ſeveral Men loſt in the like manner, and never heard of afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Such an Accident befel one Captain <hi>Hall</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> who came hither in a <hi>Boſton</hi> Ship, to take in Logwood, and was fraighted by two Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

One Morning the Captain deſigning to hunt, took five of his Men, with his Mate, as alſo his Merchant Mr. <hi>Cane</hi> along with him. They Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Eaſt end of the Iſland, which is low <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove-land;</hi> the Savannah is a conſiderable diſtance from the Sea, and therefore troubleſom to get to it. However, unleſs they would row four or five Leagues farther, they could not find a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place; beſide, they doubted not of Mr. <hi>Canes</hi> ſkill to conduct them. After they had followed him a Mile or two into the Woods, the Captain ſeeing him to make a Halt (as being in ſome doubt) to conſider of the way, told him in deriſion, that he was but a ſorry Woodſman, and that he would ſwing him but twice round, and he ſhould not gueſs the way out again; and ſaying no more to him went forwards, and bid his Seamen follow him, which they did accordingly. Mr. <hi>Cane,</hi> after he had recollected himſelf, ſtruck off another way, and deſired them to go with him: But inſtead of that, they were all for following the Captain. In a ſhort time Mr. <hi>Cane</hi> got out of the Woods into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, and there kill'd a good fat Cow, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering it, made it fit for Carriage, ſuppoſing the Captain and Crew would ſoon be with him. But after waiting 3 or 4 hours, and firing his Gun ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, without hearing any Anſwer, took up his Burden and returned towards the Sea-ſide; and upon giving a Signal a Boat came and brought him aboard. In the Mean time the Captain and his Men after 4 or 5 Hours ranging the Woods, began to grow tired, and then his Mate happily truſting more to his own Judgment, left him and the four Seamen, and about

                  <p>When he came Aboard he gave an Account where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and in what a condition he left the Captain and his Men; but it being then too late to ſeek him, the next Morning very early Mr. <hi>Cane</hi> and two Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men taking Directions from the Mate (who was ſo fatigued that he could not ſtir) where he had left the Captain, went aſhore, and at length came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in call of him, and at laſt found him laid down in a Thicket, having juſt ſenſe to call out ſometimes, but not ſtrength enough to ſtand; ſo they were forced to carry him to the Sea-ſide. When they had a little refreſhed him with Brandy and Water, he told them how his Company had fainted for Thirſt, and drop'd down one after another, though he ſtill incouraged them to be chearful and reſt themſelves a while, till he got ſome ſupplies of Water for them; that they were very patient, and that two of his Men held out till five a Clock in the Afternoon, and then they fainted alſo; but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proceeded in queſt of his way till night; and then fell down in the place where they then found him.</p>
                  <p>The two Seamen carried the Captain Aboard, while Mr. <hi>Cane</hi> ſcarched about for the reſt, but to no purpoſe; for he returned without them, and could never hear of them afterwards.</p>
                  <p>This was a warning to me never to ſtraggle from my Conſorts in our Hunting. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>When my Months Service was up, in which time we brought down all the Wood to the Creek ſide, I was preſently pay'd my Tun of Logwood; with which, and ſome more that I borrow'd, I bought a little Proviſion, and was afterwards entertained as a

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> Companion at work with ſome of my former Maſters; for they preſently broke up Conſort-ſhips, letting the Wood lye till either Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> came to fetch it, according to his Contract, or elſe till they ſhould otherwiſe diſpoſe of it. Some of them immediately went to <hi>Beef-Iſland</hi> to kill Bullocks for their Hides, which they preſerve by pegging them out very tite on the Ground. Firſt they turn the fleſhy ſide, and after the hair upwards, letting them lye ſo till they are very dry. 32 ſtrong Pegs as big as a Man's Arm, are required to ſtretch the Hide as it ought to be. When they are dry they fold them in the middle from Head to Tail, with the Hair outward; and then hang them croſs a ſtrong pole ſo high that the ends may not touch the Ground, 40 or 50, one upon another, and once in 3 Weeks or a Month they beat them with great Sticks, to ſtrike off the Worms that breed in the Hair, and eat it off, which ſpoils the Hide. When they are to be ſhip'd off, they ſoak them in ſalt Water to kill the remaining Worms; and while they are yet wet they fold them in 4 folds, and afterwards ſpread them abroad again to dry. When they are fully dry, they fold them up again, and ſo ſend them Aboard. I was yet a Stranger to this Work, therefore remained with 3 of the old Crew to cut more Logwood. My Conſorts were all three Scotch-men; one of them named <hi>Price Morrice</hi> had lived there ſome Years, and was Maſter of a pretty large Periago; for without ſome ſort of Boat, here is no ſtirring from one place to another. The other two were young Men that had been bred Merchants, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Duncam Campbell;</hi> and Mr. <hi>George</hi>—Theſe two not liking either the Place or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, waited an opportunity of going away by the firſt Ship that came hither to take in Logwood. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly not long after the above-mentioned. Capt. <hi>Hall</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> came hither on that deſign, and was

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> fraighted by them with 40 Tun. It was agreed that <hi>George</hi> ſhould ſtay behind to cut Logwood; but <hi>Campbell</hi> ſhould go to <hi>New-England</hi> to ſell this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and bring back Flower, and ſuch other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that were proper to purchaſe Hides and Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in the Bay. This retarded our buſineſs; for I did not find <hi>Price Morrice</hi> very intent at Work: for 'tis like he thought he had Logwood enough. And I have particularly obſerved there, and in other Places, that ſuch as had been well-bred, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally moſt careful to improve their Time, and would be very induſtrious and frugal, when there was any probability of conſiderable Gain. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſuch as had been inur'd to hard Labour, and got their Living by the ſweat of their Brows, when they came to a plenty, would extravagantly ſquander away their Time and Money in Drinking and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bluſter.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, I kept to my Work by my ſelf, till I was hindred by a hard, red and angry Swelling like a Boyl, in my right Leg; ſo painful that I was ſcarce able to ſtand on it: but I was directed to roaſt and apply the Roots of White Lillies (of which here is great plenty, growing by the Creek ſides) to draw it to a head. This I did three or four Days, without any benefit. At laſt I perceived two White Specks in the middle of the Boil; and ſqueezing it, two ſmall white Worms ſpurted out: I took them both up in my Hand, and perceived each of them to be inveſted with three Rows of black, ſhort, ſtiff Hair, running clear round them; one Row near each end; the other in the middle; each Row diſtinct from other; and all very regular and uniform. The Worms were about the bigneſs of a Hens Quill, and about three fourths of an Inch long.</p>
                  <p>I never ſaw Worms of this ſort breed in any Man's Fleſh. Indeed <hi>Guinea Worms</hi> are very frequent in ſome Places of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſao;</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> They breed as well in Whites as Negroes: And becauſe that Iſland was formerly a Magazin of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, while the Dutch drove that Trade with the Spaniards, and the Negroes were moſt ſubject to them; 'twas therefore believed that other People took them by Infection from them. I rather judge that they are generated by drinking bad Water; and 'tis as likely that the Water of the other Iſland of <hi>Aruba</hi> and <hi>Bonariry</hi> may produce the ſame Effects; for many of thoſe that went with me from thence to <hi>Virginia</hi> (mentioned in my former Volume) were troubled with them after our arrival there: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly I my ſelf had one broke out in my Ancle, after I had been there five or ſix Months.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Worms are no bigger than a large brown Thread, but (as I have heard) five or ſix Yards long; and if it breaks in drawing out, that part which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Fleſh will putrifie, and be very painful, and indanger the Patients Life; or at leaſt the uſe of that Limb: and I have known ſome that have been ſcarified and cut ſtrangely, to take out the Worm. I was in great torment before it came out: my Leg and Ancle ſwell'd and look'd very red and angry; and I kept a Plaiſter, to it, to bring it to a Head. At laſt drawing off my Plaiſter out came about three Inches of the Worm; and my pain abated preſently. Till then I was Ignorant of my Malady; and the Gentlewoman, at whoſe Houſe I was, took it for a Nerve; but I knew enough what it was, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently roll'd it up on a ſmall Stick. After that I opened it every Morning and Evening, and ſtrained it out gently, about 2 Inches at a time, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome pain, till at length I had got out about two Foot.</p>
                  <p>Riding with one Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> who was going to a Negro to have his Horſe cured of a gall'd Back, I aſked the Negro if he could undertake my Leg: and which he did readily; and in the mean

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> time I obſerved his Method in curing the Horſe; which was this. Firſt he ſtrok'd the ſore Place, then applying to it a little rough Powder, which looked like Tobacco Leaves dryed and crumbled ſmall, and mumbling ſome Words to himſelf, he blew upon the part three times, and waving his Hands as often over it, ſaid, it would be well ſpeedily. His Fee for the Cure was a White Cock.</p>
                  <p>Then coming to me, and looking on the Worm in my Ancle, he promiſed to cure it in three Days, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding alſo a White Cock for his pains, and uſing exactly the ſame Method with me, as he did with the Horſe. He bad me not open it in three Days; but I did not ſtay ſo long; for the next Morning the Cloath being rubb'd off, I unbound it, and found the Worm broken off, and the Hole quite healed up. I was afraid the remaining part would have given ſome trouble, but have not felt any pain there from that day to this.</p>
                  <p>To return. I told you how I was interrupted in following my Work, by the Worms breeding in my Leg. And to compleat my misfortune, preſently after we had the moſt violent Storm, for above 24 Hours, that ever was known in theſe Parts. An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which I ſhall give more particularly in my <hi>Diſcourſe of Winds</hi> and ſhall now only mention ſome Paſſages.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſaid, we were four of us in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at this Place cutting Logwood: and by this Storm were reduced to great Inconveniencies; for while that laſted we could dreſs no Victuals, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There were 4 Ships riding here, when the Storm began: but at our arrival we found only one, and hoped to have got ſome Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it, but found very cold entertainment: For we could neither get Bread nor Punch, nor ſo much as a Dram of Rum, though we offered them Money for it. The Reaſon was, they were already over-charged with ſuch as being diſtreſſed by the Storm, had been forced to take Sanctuary with them: Seeing we could not be ſupplied here, we aſked which way the other three Ships were driven? they told us that Capt. <hi>Prout</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> was driven towards <hi>Triſt,</hi> and 'twas probable he was carried out to Sea, unleſs he ſtruck on a Sand, called the <hi>Middle Ground;</hi> that Capt. <hi>Skinner</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> was driven towards <hi>Beef-Iſland;</hi> and Captain <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> drove away towards <hi>Man-of-War Lagune.</hi>

The Head of his Ketch was dry, and at the Stern, there was above 4 foot Water.

The Eaſtermoſt part for about three Leagues from <hi>Triſt</hi> is Low and Mangrovy; at the end of which there is a ſmall ſalt Creek, deep enough at high Water for Boats to paſs.</p>
                  <p>From this Creek to the Weſt end, is 4 Leagues all ſandy Bay, cloſed on the backſide with a low Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, abounding with thick prickly Buſhes, like a White-thorn; bearing a whitiſh hard ſhell-Fruit, as big as a Sloe, much like a Calla-baſh. The Weſt end is waſhed with the River St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Paul.</hi> This end is over-grown with red Mangroves. About 3 Leagues up from the Mouth of this River ſhoots forth a ſmall Branch, running to the Eaſtward, and dividing <hi>Beef-Iſland</hi> from the Main on the South, and afterwards makes a great Lake of freſh Water, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Freſh Water Lagune.</hi> This afterward falls into a Salt Lake, called <hi>Man-of-War Lagune;</hi> which empties it ſelf into <hi>Laguna Termina,</hi> about 2 Leagues from the South Eaſt Point of the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>The inſide or middle of this Iſland is a Savannah, bordered all round with Trees, moſt Mangrovy; either black, white or red, with ſome Logwood.</p>

They build every Man his own Houſe, and tye up their Hammacks between two Trees; wherein they ſleep till their Houſes are made.

They clear no more Ground than what they actually employ for their Subſiſtance. They make no Paths: but when they go far from Home; they break now and then a Bough; letting it hang down; which ſerves as a Mark to guide them in their return. If they happen to be diſcovered by other Indians, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting ſtill among the Spaniards, or do but miſtruſt it, they immediately ſhift their Quarters to another Place.

                  <p>The Engliſh Logwood-Cutters happened once to come hither, whilſt <hi>John d' Acoſta</hi> was there; and he hearing their Guns, made towards them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to forbear firing; becauſe it would make the Cattle wild; but told them that any time when they wanted Beef, if they ſent to him he would hor as many as they pleaſed, and bring the Meat to their Canoas. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> thankfully accepted his Offer; and did never after ſhoot his Cattle; but ſent to him, when they wanted; and he (according to his Promiſe) ſupplied them. This created him ſo much Friendſhip, that they intended when they returned to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> to bring him a preſent, and Goods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Trade with him; which would have been very Advantagious to both Parties: but ſome of his Servants acquainted the Townſmen of it, at his return to <hi>Campeachy.</hi> And they being Jealous of the Engliſh, and envying him, complained to the Governour; who preſently caſt him into Priſon, where he remained many Years: This happened about the Year 71 or 72. Thus the Project of Trading with the Engliſh miſcarried here, and <hi>John d' Acoſta</hi> was forced to relinquiſh his Right of this

                  <p>This way of Hockſing Bullocks ſeems peculiar to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> eſpecially to thoſe that live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who are very dextrous at it. For this Reaſon ſome of of them are conſtantly employed in it all the Year; and ſo become very expert. The <hi>Hockſer</hi> is mounted on a good Horſe, bred up to the Sport; who knovv ſo well vvhen to advance or retreat upon occaſion, that the Rider has no trouble to manage him. His Arms is a Hockſing Iron, which is made in the ſhape of a Half Moon, and from one corner to the other is about 6 or 7 Inches; vvith a very ſharp Edge.</p>
                  <p>This Iron is faſtned by a Socket to a Pole about 14 or 15 Foot long. When the Hockſer is mounted, he lays the Pole over the Head of his Horſe, with the Iron forward, and then rides after his Game; and having overtaken it, ſtrikes his Iron juſt above the Hock, and Hamſtrings it. The Horſe preſently wheels off to the left; for the wounded Beaſt makes at him preſently with all his force; but he ſcampers away a good diſtance before he comes about again. If the Hamſtring is not quite cut aſunder with the ſtroke, yet the Bullock by continual ſpringing out his Leg, certainly breaks it: and then can go but on three Legs, yet ſtill limps forward to be revenged on his Enemy. Then the Hockſer rides up ſoftly to him and ſtrikes his Iron into the Knee of one of his fore-Legs; and then he immediately tumbles down. He gets off his Horſe, and taking a ſharp-pointed ſtrong Knife, ſtrikes it into his Pole, a little behind the Horns, ſo dextrouſly that at one blow he cuts the ſtring of his Neck; and down falls his Head. This they call <hi>Poling.</hi> Then the Hockſer immediately Mounts, and Rides after more Game, leaving the other to the

                  <p>The right Ear of the Hockſing-Horſe by the weight of the Pole lay'd conſtantly over it when on Duty, hangs down always, by which you may know it from other Horſes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> pick and chufe only the Bulls and old Cows, and leave the young Cattle to breed; by which means they always preſerve their Stock entire. On the contrary, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> kill without diſtinction; yea, the young rather than the old; without regard of keeping up their Stock. <hi>Jamaica</hi> is a remarkable Inſtance of this our Folly, in this Particular. For when it was firſt taken by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> the Savannahs were well ſtockt with Cattle; but were ſoon all deſtroy'd by our Souldiers, who ſuffered great Hardſhips afterwards for it: and it was never ſtock'd again till Sir <hi>Thomas Linch</hi> was Governour. He ſent to <hi>Cuba</hi> for a ſupply of Cattle, which are now grown very plentiful, becauſe every Man knows his own proper Goods. Whereas before, when there was no Property, each Man deſtroyed as faſt as he could. The <hi>French</hi> (I think) are greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had it not been for the great care of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in Stocking the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> with Hogs and Bullocks, the Privateers muſt have ſtarved. But now the Main, as well as the Iſland, is plentiful provided; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> the Iſlands of <hi>Cuba, Pines, Hiſpaniola, Portarica,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> is dangerous for a ſingle Man to fire at them, or to venture through the Savannahs. For the old Bulls that have been formerly ſhot, will make at him: and they will all draw up in Battalia to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon our approach; the old Bulls in the Front; behind them the Cows, in the ſame manner; and behind them the young Cattle. And if we ſtrive to wheel about to get in the Reer, the Bulls will certainly face about that way, and ſtill preſent a Front to us. Therefore we ſeldom ſtrive to ſhoot any out of a great Herd; but walk about in the Woods, cloſe by the Savannah; and there we light of our Game. The Beaſt makes directly at the Hunter, if it be deſperately wounded (as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced my ſelf) but if but ſlightly, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly run away. The old Hunters tell us, that a Cow is more dangerous of the two; becauſe they ſay, ſhe runs at her Enemy with her Eyes open; but the Bull ſhuts his, ſo that you may eaſily avoid him. But this I cannot affirm upon my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and rather doubt the truth of it; for I knew one ſhrewdly gor'd by a Bull. He was a Conſort with Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> in the Weſt Lagune; where having tir'd themſelves with cutting of Logwood, they took an occaſion to go in their Canoa to <hi>Beef-Iſland,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves there a fortnight or three Weeks; becauſe here were ſeveral ſorts of Fruits, and plenty of Cabbage to eat with their freſh Beef, which they could not fail to meet with. They came to a Place call'd the <hi>Salt-Greek;</hi> and there built them a Hut. About 4 a clock while Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> lay down to ſleep, his Conſort march'd out into the Savannah, about a Mile from their Huts; and there coming within ſhot of a Bull, wounded him deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but yet the Bull had ſtill ſo much ſtrength left as to purſue and overtake his Adverſary, trampling on him; and goring his Thigh, ſo that he was not able

The Bull by this time was ſpent, and fell down dead by him: And there the Man had alſo periſhed, if Mr. <hi>Barker</hi> had not come the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſeek him; who finding him by the dead Beaſt, took him on his Back, and lug'd him home to their Hut. The next day he put him in his Canoa, and delivered him aboard a Ship, into the hands of a Surgeon, who cured him in a little time.</p>
                  <p>I told you we left Capt. <hi>Chandler,</hi> with a deſign of going to <hi>Beef-Iſland,</hi> to ſpend ſome time in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Pies Pond,</hi> before mentioned. But before we came thither we went a ſhore to kill a Beef for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; where I was ſurprized with an odd accident. Paſſing throught a ſmall Savannah, about 2 or 3 Foot deep, we ſmelt a ſtrong ſcent of an Alligator; and preſently after I ſtumbled over one, and fell down immediarely. I cry'd out for help; but my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, inſtead of aſſiſting me, ran away towards the Wood.

                  <p>THE River St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſprings from the high Mountains of <hi>Chiapo,</hi> about 20 Leagues within the Country, which are ſo called from a City not far diſtant. Its firſt Courſe is Eaſterly for a conſiderable length, till it meets with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on that ſide: then it turns ſhort about North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till within 12 Leagues of the Sea. And laſtly, it divides its ſelf into two Branches. The Weſtern Branch falls into the River <hi>Tobaſco;</hi> the other keeps its Courſe till within 4 Leagues of the Sea; then divides it ſelf again. The Eaſtermoſt of theſe Branches ſeparates <hi>Beef-Iſland</hi> from the Main; and falls into <hi>Man-of-War Lagune,</hi> as is before related. The other keeps its Courſe and Name till it falls into the Sea, between <hi>Beef-Iſland</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſco Iſland;</hi> where it is no broader than the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Graveſend.</hi> There is a Bar at its Entrance, but of what depth I know not; over which ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels may paſs well enough by the Benefit of the Tide. It is both deeper and broader after you are in; for there it is 15 or 16 Foot Water, and very good Riding. By Report of the Privateers who have been up this River, it is very broad before it

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> parts; and beyond that farther in the Country, has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers large Indians Towns built on its Banks: the chief of which is called <hi>Summaſenta;</hi> and many large Cacao and Plantains walks: the Soil on each ſide being very fruitful. The unmanur'd Land is overgrown with lofty Trees of many ſorts, eſpecially the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or Cabbage; of the latter there are whole Groves; and in ſome Places (eſpecially a little way from the Rivers ſide) great Savannahs full of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, Horſes, and other Animals; amongſt which the Mountain Cow (called by the Spaniards <hi>Ante</hi>) is moſt remarkable.</p>
                  <p>This Beaſt is as big as a Bullock of two Years old. It is ſhaped like a Cow in Body; but her Head much bigger. Her Noſe is ſhort, and the Head more compact and round. She has no Horns. Her Eyes are round, full, and of a prodigious ſize. She has great Lips, but not ſo thick as the Cows Lips. Her Ears are in proportion to the Head, rather broader than thoſe of the Common Cow. Her Neck is thick and ſhort. Her Legs alſo ſhorter than ordinary. She has a pretty long Tail; thin of Hairs, and no Bob at the end. She has courſe thin Hair all over her Body. Her Hide is near two Inches thick. Her fleſh is red; the grain of it very fine. The Fat is white, and all together it is ſweet wholſom Meat. One of them will weigh 5 or 600 Weight.</p>
                  <p>This Creature is always found in the Woods near ſome large River; and feeds on a ſort of long thin Graſs, or Moſs, which grows plentifully on the Banks of Rivers; but never feeds in Savannahs, or Paſtures of good Graſs, as all other Bullocks do. When her Belly is full, ſhe lies down to ſleep by the brink of the River; and at the leaſt Noiſe ſlips into the Water: where ſinking down to the bottom, tho' very deep, ſhe walks as on dry Ground. She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run faſt, therefore never rambles far from the River; for there ſhe always takes Sanctuary, in caſe

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> of danger. There is no ſhooting of her, but when ſhe is aſleep.</p>
                  <p>They are found, beſide this Place, in the Rivers in the Bay of <hi>Honduras;</hi> and on all the Main from thence as high as the River of <hi>Darien.</hi> Several of my Conſorts have kill'd them there, and knew their Track, which I my ſelf ſaw in the Iſthmus of <hi>Darien;</hi> but ſhould not have known it, but as I was told by them. For I never did ſee one, nor the Track of any but once. The Impreſſion in the Sand, ſeemed much like the Track of a Cow, but I was well aſſured that none of our common Cows could live in that Place: neither are there any near it by many Miles.</p>
                  <p>My Conſorts than gave me this Relation, and ſince I have had the ſame from other Engliſh-men as well as Spaniards.</p>

But for further ſatisfaction, I have here infected two Accounts of the <hi>African Hippopotamus,</hi> as they were ſent; the one of the Honourable Perſon before-mentioned, from Captain <hi>Covent</hi> of <hi>Porbury,</hi> near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a Gentleman of great Ability and Experience, as well as known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, who uſed to Trade to <hi>Angola:</hi> The other to my ſelf, from my worthy Friend Captain <hi>Rogers,</hi> as he has ſeen them in the River <hi>Natal,</hi> in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 30, on the Eaſt ſide of the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> twice as big. He graſes on the ſhore, and dungs like a Horſe. Is of a dark-brown, but glittering in the Water. His pace is but ſlow on the ſhore; in the Water more ſwift. He there feeds on ſmall Fiſh and what he can get; and will go down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in 3 Fathom Water. For I have watch'd him; and he hath ſtaid above half an hour before he aroſe. He is very miſchievous to white Men. I have known him open his Mouth and ſet one Tooth on the Gunnel of a Boat, and another on the ſecond Strake from the Keel (which was more than four foot diſtant) and there bit a hole through the Plank, and ſunk the Boat; and after he had done, he went away ſhaking his Ears. His ſtrength is incredibly great; for I have ſeen him in the Waſh of the ſhore, when the Sea has toſſed in a Dutch-man's Boat, with 14 Hogſheads of Water in her, upon the ſaid Beaſt; and left it dry on his Back; and another Sea came and fetch'd the Boat off, and the Beaſt was not hurt, as far as I could perceive. How his Teeth grow in his Mouth I could not ſee; only that they were round like a Bow, and about 16 Inches long; and in the biggeſt part more than 6 Inches about. We made ſeveral ſhot at him; but to no purpoſe, for they would glance from him as from a Wall. The Natives call him a <hi>Kittimpungo,</hi> and ſay he is <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſo,</hi> which is a kind of a God; for nothing, they ſay can kill him: And if they ſhould do to him, as the White Men do, he would ſoon deſtroy their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noas and Fiſhing-Nets. Their Cuſtom is when he comes near their Canoas, to throw him Fiſh; and then he paſſeth away, and will not meddle with their Fiſhing Craft. He doth moſt miſchief when he can ſtand on the Ground; but when a-float, hath only power to bite. As our Boat once lay near the ſhore, I ſaw him go under her, and with his Back lift her out of the Water; and overſet her with 6 Men aboard: but, as it happened, did them no harm.

The Hoofs of his Feet are Cloven in the middle: And it has two ſmall Hoofs above the Footlock, which bending to the Ground when it goes, make an Impreſſion on the Sand like four Claws. His Tail is ſhort and tapering like a Swines; without any Bob at the end. This Beaſt is commonly fat and very good Meat. It grazeth aſhore in wet ſwampy Ground near Rivers or Ponds; but retires to the Water, if puruſed. When they are in the Water, they will ſink down to the bottom; and there walk as on dry Ground. They will run almoſt as faſt as a Man; but if chaſed hard, they will turn about and look very fierce, like a Boar; and fight if put to it. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

                  <p>The Weſt branch of the River St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after it has run 8 or 9 Leagues N. W. loſeth it ſelf in <hi>Tobaſco</hi> River about 4 Leagues from the Sea, and ſo makes the Iſland <hi>Tobaſco,</hi> which is 12 Leagues long, and 4 broad at the North end: for from the River St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the mouth of <hi>Tobaſco</hi> River, is accounted 4 Leagues; and the Shore lies Eaſt and Weſt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt League on the Eaſt is <hi>Mangrove Land,</hi> with ſome Sandy Bay, where Turtle come aſhore to lay their Eggs.</p>

For this fruit is full of ſmall ſeeds; which being ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed whole by the Cattle, are voided whole by them again; and then taking root in their Dung, ſpring up abundantly.</p>
                  <p>Here are alſo Deer in great numbers; theſe we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtantly find feeding in the Savannahs Mornings and Evenings. And I remember an unlucky Accident whilſt I was there. Two or three Men went out one Evening purpoſely to hunt; when they were in the ſpots of Savannahs, they ſeparated to find their Game, and at laſt it ſo happened, that one of them fired at a Deer and killed it, and while he was ſkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, he was ſhot ſtark dead by one of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, who fired at him, miſtaking him for a Deer. The poor Man was very ſorry for ſo ſad a miſchance; and for fear of the dead Man's Friends, durſt never go back again to <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The River of <hi>Tobaſco</hi> is the moſt noted in all the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> and ſprings alſo from the high Mountains of <hi>Chiapo;</hi> but much more to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Paul.</hi> From thence it runs N. E. till within 4 Leagues of the Sea, where it receives the fore-mentioned Branch of St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and then runs North till it falls into the Sea. Its Mouth is about two Miles wide, and there is a Bar of Sand lying off it, with not above 11 or 12 foot Water; but a Mile or two within the Mouth, at a nook or bending of the River on the Eaſt-ſide there is three Fathom, and good Riding, without any danger from the ſtrength of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The Tide flows up about four Leagues in the dry Seaſon, but in the Rains not ſo far; for then the Freſhes make the Ebb run very ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>During the Norths it over-flows all the low Land

                  <p>This River, near its Mouth, abounds with Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, with ſome Snooks, and <hi>Manatee</hi> in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; there being good feeding for them in many of its Creeks, eſpecially in one place on the Starbord ſide about 2 Leagues from the Sea, which runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land 2 or 300 paces, and then opens very wide, and is ſo ſhoal that you may ſee their backs above Water as they feed; a thing ſo rare, that I have heard our <hi>Muſketo-Men</hi> ſay, they never ſaw it any where elſe; on the leaſt noiſe they will all ſcamper out into the <hi>River:</hi> yet the <hi>Muſketo-men</hi> ſeldom miſs of ſtriking them. There are a ſort of Freſh-water <hi>Manatee,</hi> not altogether ſo big as the Sea kind, but otherwiſe exactly alike in ſhape and taſt, and I think rather fatter. The Land by the Rivers, eſpecially on the Starbord ſide, is ſwampy, and overgrown with Trees.</p>
                  <p>(Here are alſo abundance of Trees, the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I ever ſaw, till I came to the <hi>Gallapagos</hi> Iſlands in the S. Seas) <hi>viz. Mangroves, Macaws,</hi> and other ſorts that I know not. In ſome places near the River ſide, further up the Country, are Ridges of dry Land, full of lofty Cabbage and Cotton Trees, which make a very pleaſant Landſkip. There is no Settlement within 8 Leagues of the River's Mouth, and then you come to a ſmall Breaſt-work, where there is commonly a <hi>Spaniard</hi> with 8 or 9 <hi>Indians</hi> poſted on each ſide the River, to watch for Boats coming that way: And becauſe there are divers Creeks running in from the Savannahs, ſome of theſe Sentinesl are ſo placed in the Woods, that they may look into the Savannahs, for fear being ſurprized on the back ſide: Yet for all their caution, theſe Sentinels were ſnap'd by <hi>Captain Nevil,</hi> Commander of a ſmall <hi>Brigantine,</hi> in a ſecond Expedition that he made to take the Town called <hi>Villa de Moſe.</hi> His

But the ſecond time he got into a Creek, a League below theſe Sentinels, and there dragging his Canoas over ſome Trees that were laid croſs it, purpoſely to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his paſſage, he came in the night upon their backs in their ſeveral Poſt; ſo that the Town, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of his coming by their firing as they ſhould have done, was taking without any reſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Villa de Moſe</hi> is a ſmall Town ſtanding on the Starboard ſide of the River, 4 Leagues beyond this Breaſt-work. 'Tis inhabited chiefly by <hi>Indians,</hi> with ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> there is a Church in the middle, and a Fort at the Weſt end, which commands the River. Thus far Ships come to bring goods, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>European</hi> Commodities; <hi>viz.</hi> Broad-cloth, Serges, Perpetuana's, Kerſies, Thred-Stockings, Hats, Oſnabrugs white and blew, Kentins, Platilloes, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannias, Hollandilloes, Iron-work, &amp;c. They arrive here in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> and ſtay till <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> ſelling their Commodities, and then load chiefly with <hi>Cacao,</hi> and ſome <hi>Sylveſter.</hi> All the <hi>Merchants</hi> and petty Traders of the Country Towns come hither about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> to Traffick, which makes this Town the chiefeſt in all theſe parts, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy</hi> excepted; yet there are but few Rich Men that live here. Sometimes Ships that come hither load Hides and Tallow, if they cannot fraight with Cacao. But the chiefeſt place for Hides is a Town lying on a Branch of this River, that comes out a League below the Breaſt-work, where <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Barks uſually lade once a Year; but I can give no further account of it. Four Leagues beyond <hi>Villa de Moſe</hi> further up the River lies <hi>Eſtapo,</hi> inhabited partly with <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but moſt <hi>Indians,</hi> as generally the Towns in this Country are: It's ſaid to be pretty rich; ſtands cloſe by the River, on the South ſide, and is ſo built between two Creeks, that there is but one Avenue leading to it; and ſo well guarded

In his way thither he took <hi>Villa de Moſe,</hi> and left a Party there to ſecure his Retreat. If he had taken <hi>Eſtapo,</hi> he deſigned to paſs on to <hi>Halpo,</hi> a Rich Town, three Leagues farther up the River, and from thence to viſit <hi>Tacatalpo,</hi> lying 3 or 4 Leagues beyond, which is accounted the wealthieſt of the three: the Spaniards call it <hi>Tacatalpo de Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erra:</hi> whether to diſtinguiſh it from another Town of that name, or to denote its nearneſs to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, I know not. 'Tis the beſt Town on this River, having three Chnrches, and ſeveral Rich Merchants; and between it and <hi>Villa de Moſe</hi> are many large Cacao Walks on each ſide the River.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen a ſort of white Cacao brought from hence, which I never met with any where elſe. It is of the ſame bigneſs and colour on the outſide, and with ſuch a thin huſky Coat as the other; but the inner ſubſtance is white, like fine Flower; and when the outward Coat is broken, it crumbles as a lump of Flower doth. Thoſe that frequent the Bay call it <hi>Spama,</hi> and affirm that it is much uſed by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> of thoſe parts, to make their Chocolate froth, who therefore ſet a great value on it. But I never yet met with any in <hi>England</hi> that knew it, except the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Carbery,</hi> who was pleaſed to tell me he had ſeen of it.</p>
                  <p>The Land on the South ſide of the River is low Savannahs or Paſture: The ſide where the Town of <hi>Villa de Moſe</hi> ſtands, is a ſort of grey ſandy Earth; and the whole Country, the Up-land I mean, ſeems to be much the ſame: But the Low-land is of a black deep Mould, and in ſome places very ſtrong Clay; and there is not a Stone to be found in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

The <hi>Cacao Tree</hi> thrives here very well; but the Nuts are ſmaller than the <hi>Caraccus Nuts;</hi> yet Oyly and Fat whilſt new. They are not plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the Sea, as they are on the Coaſt of <hi>Caraccus,</hi> but at leaſt 8 or 10 Miles up in the Country. The Cacao-walks belong chiefly to the Spaniards; and are only planted and dreſs'd by Indians, hired for that purpoſe; yet the Indians have of their own, Plantain-walks, Plantations of Maiz, and ſome ſmall Cacao-walks; about which they ſpent the chiefeſt of their time. Some employ themſelves to ſearch in the Woods for Bees that build in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Trees: and get a good livelihood by the Honey and Wax. Theſe are of two ſorts: One pretty large; the other no bigger, but longer, than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary black Fly: in other reſpects, juſt like our common Bees; only of a darker colour. Their Stings are not ſtrong enough to enter a Man's Skin; but if diſturbed, they will fly at one as furiouſly as the Great Bees; and will tickle, but cannot hurt you. Their Honey is white and clear; and they make a great deal of it. The Indians keep of them tame, and cut hollow Trunks for them to make their Combs in. They place one end of the Log (which is ſaw'd very even) on a Board, leaving a hole for the Bees to creep in at: and the upper end is covered with a Board, put cloſe over it. The young and luſty Indians (ſuch as want Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment) hire themſelves to the Spaniards. They Work cheap, and are commonly paid in ſuch Goods as the Spaniards do not value. And I have been told that they are obliged to Work for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, one day in a Week, <hi>gratis:</hi> But whether this Priviledge belongs only to the <hi>Padres,</hi> or to the Laity alſo, I know not. The Indians inhabiting theſe Villages, live like Gentlemen in Compariſon

                  <p>This Country is very fruitful; yelding plentiful Crops of Maiz; which is there chiefeſt Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. After it is boiled they bruiſe it on ſuch a Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing-Stone as Chocolate is ground on. Some of it they make into ſmall thin Cakes, called <hi>Tartilloes.</hi> The reſt they are put into a Jar till it grows ſowr; and when they are thirſty, mix a handful of it in a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaſh of Water, which gives it a ſharp pleaſant taſte, then ſtraining it through a large Callabaſh prick'd full of ſmall Holes to keep out the Huſks, they drink it off. If they treat a Friend with this Drink, they mix a little Honey with it; for their Ability reaches no higher: And this is as acceptable to them as a Glaſs of Wine to us. If they travel for two or three Days from Home, they carry ſome of this ground Maiz in a Plantain Leaf, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaſh at their Girdles to make their drink, and take no farther care for Victuals, till they come home again. This is called <hi>Poſole:</hi> And by the Engliſh <hi>Poorſoul.</hi> It is ſo much eſteemed by the Indians, that they are never without ſome of it in their Houſes.</p>
                  <p>Another way of Preparing their Drink, is to parch the Maiz, and then grind it to Powder on the Rubbing-ſtone, putting a little <hi>Anatta</hi> to it; which grows in their Plantations, and is uſed by them for no other purpoſe. They mix it all

                  <p>In long Journeys they prefer this Drink before Poſole.</p>
                  <p>They feed abundance of Turkies, Ducks and Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill Fowls, of which the Padre has an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and is very ſtrict in gathering his Tithe: and they dare not kill any except they have his Leave for it.</p>
                  <p>They plant Cotton alſo for their Cloathing. The Men wear only a ſhort Jacket and Breeches. Theſe with a Palmeto-Leaf Hat is their <hi>Sundays</hi> Dreſs; for they have neither Stockings nor Shoes; neither do they wear theſe Jackets on Week Days. The Women have a Cotton-Petticoat, and a large Frock down to their Knees; the Sleeves to their Wriſts, but not gathered. The Boſom is open to the Breaſt, and Imbroidered with black or red Silk, or Grogram Yarn, two Inches broad on each ſide the Breaſt, and clear round the Neck. In this Garb, with their Hair ty'd up in a Knot behind, they think themſelves extream fine.</p>
                  <p>The Men are obliged by the Padres (as I have been inform'd) to Marry when they are Fourteen Years old, and the Women when Twelve: And if that Age they are not provided, the Prieſt will chuſe a Virgin for the Man (or a Man for the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) of Equal Birth and Fortune; and joyn them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards give ſeveral Reaſons for this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That it preſerves them from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucher, and makes them Induſtrious.—That it brings them to pay Taxes, both to the King and Church; for as ſoon as they are Married they pay to both.—And that it keeps them from ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling out of their own Pariſh, and ſettling in another, which would by ſo much leſſen the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres

They love each other very well; and live comfortably by the ſweat of their Brows: They build good large Houſes, and inhabit altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Towns. The ſide Walls are Mud or Watling, plaiſter'd on the inſide; and thatch'd with Palm or Palmeto Leaves.</p>
                  <p>The Churches are large, built much higher than the Common Houſes, and covered with Pantile: and within adorned with Coarſe Pictures and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saints; which are all painted tauny like the Indians themſelves. Beſides theſe Ornaments, there are kept in the Curches Pipes, Hautboys, Drums, Vizars and Perruques for their Recreation at ſolemn Times; for they have little or no Sport or Paſtime but in Common, and that only upon Saints Days, and the Nights enſuing.</p>
                  <p>The Padres that ſerve here, muſt learn the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Language before they can have a Benefice. As for their Tithes and other Incoms, Mr. <hi>Gage,</hi> (an Engliſh Man) hath given a large Account of them in his <hi>Survey</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> But however, this I will add of my own knowledge, that they are very dutiful to their Prieſts; obſerving punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Orders: and behave themſelves very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly and reverently in their Preſence.</p>
                  <p>They are generally well ſhaped, of a middle ſize; ſtreight and clean Limbed. The Men more ſpare, the Women plump and fat, their Faces are round and flat, their Foreheads low, their Eyes little, their Noſes of a middle ſize, ſomewhat flattiſh: full Lips; pretty full but little Mouths: white Teeth, and their Colour of a dark tauny, like other Indians. They ſleep in Hammacks made with ſmall Cords like a Net, faſtned at each end to a Poſt. Their Furniture is but mean, <hi>viz.</hi> Earthen Pots to boil their Maiz in, and abundance of Callabaſhes.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1766</label> River <hi>Checapeque</hi> is 7 Leagues. The Coaſt lies Eaſt and Weſt; all Woody low Ground, ſandy Bay, and good Anchoring; but there falls in a pretty high Sea on the ſhore, therefore but bad Landing; yet Canoas may with care run in, if the Men are ready to leap out, as ſoon as ſhe touches the Ground; and then ſhe muſt immediately be drag'd up out of the Surf. And the ſame caution and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity is to be uſed when they go off again. There is no freſh Water between <hi>Tobaſco</hi> River and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeque.</hi> This latter is rather a ſalt Creek than a River; for the Mouth of it is not above 20 Paces wide, and about 8 or 9 Foot Water on the Bar; but within there is 12 or 13 Foot at low Water, and good riding for Barks, half a Mile within the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>This Creek runs in E. S. E. about two Miles, and then ſtrikes away South up into the Country. At its Mouth between it and the Sea is a bare ſandy Point of Land: Where, on the ſide next the River, cloſe by the Brink of it (and no where elſe) you may ſcrape up the Sand (which is courſe and brown) with your Hands, and get freſh Water; but if you dig lower the Water will be ſalt. Half a Mile within the Mouth, when you are paſt the ſandy Point, the Land is wet and ſwampy, bearing only Mangroves on each ſide for 4 or 5 Leagues up; and after that firm Land: where you will find a Run of freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being all ſalt till you come thither. A League beyond this is a Beef Eſtantion or Farm of Cattle, belonging to an Indian Village.

But how groſly they are miſtaken, I have ſatisfied the World already. And for this part of the Country, though it is rich in Land, yet it has not the leaſt appearance of any Mine, neither is it thick inhabited with Spaniards: And if I am not deceived, the very Indians in the heart of the Country, are ſcarce their Friends.</p>
                  <p>The Town of note on the S. Sea, is <hi>Teguantapeque;</hi> and on the N. Seas <hi>Keyhooca</hi> is the chiefeſt near this River.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Keyhooca</hi> is a large rich Town of good Trade, about 4 Leagues from the River <hi>Guaſickwalp,</hi> on the Weſt fide.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Country is pleaſant enough in the dry Seaſon; but when the furious North Winds rage on the Coaſt, and violently drive in the Sea, it ſuffers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, being ſo much overflown, that there is no travelling.

                  <p>From the River <hi>Guaſickwalp</hi> the Land runs Weſt 2 or 3 Leagues, all low Land with ſandy Bay to the Sea, and very woody in the Country. About three Leagues to the Weſt of it the Land trends away to the North for about 16 Leagues; riſing higher alſo even from the very Shore, as you go up within Land, making a very high Promontory called St. <hi>Martins</hi> Land; but ending in a pretty bluff point; which is the Weſt Bounds of the Bay of <hi>Campeachy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this bluff Point to <hi>Alvarado</hi> is about 20 Leagues; the firſt four of it a high rocky ſhore, with ſteep Cliffs to the Sea; and the Land ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what woody. Afterwards you paſs by very high Sand-Hills by the Sea; and an extraordinary great Sea falls in on the ſhore, which hinders any Boats from Landing. Within the Sand-hills again the Land is lower, pretty plain and fruitful enough in large Trees.</p>
                  <p>The River of <hi>Alvarado</hi> is above a Mile over at the Mouth, yet the entrance is but ſhole, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sands for near two Mile off the ſhore, clear from ſide to ſide, nevertheleſs there are two Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels through theſe Sands. The beſt, which is in the middle, has 12 or 14 Foot Water. The Land on each ſide of the Mouth is high <hi>Sand-banks,</hi> above 200 Foot high.</p>
                  <p>This River comes out of the Country in three Branches, meeting altogether juſt within the Mouth, where it is very wide and deep. One of theſe Branches comes from the Eaſtward: Another from the Weſtward: And the third, which is the true River of <hi>Alvarado</hi> and the biggeſt, comes directly out of the Country, oppoſite to the Sand-hills, about a Mile Weſt of the Rivers Mouth.

Beſides ſalt Fiſh, they export from hence abundance of dry Cod-Pepper, and ſome pickled and put in Jars. This Pepper is known by the Name of <hi>Guinea Pepper.</hi> Yet for all this Trade, 'tis but a poor Place, and has been often taken by the Privateers, chiefly to ſecure their Ships while they ſhould go up in their Canoas to the rich Towns within Land, which notwithſtanding they never yet attempted, by reaſon that <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſo near, they were ſtill afraid of being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued both by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> from thence, and ſo never durſt proſecute their deſigns on the Country Towns.</p>
                  <p>Six Leagues Weſt from <hi>Alvarado</hi> there is another large Opening out into the Sea; and it is reported to have a Communication by a ſmall Creek with this River of <hi>Alvarado;</hi> and that Canoas may paſs through it from one River to the other. And at this Opening is a ſmall Fiſhing Village. The Land by the Sea is a continued high Sand-bank, and ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Sea, that it is impoſſible to land with Boat or Canoa.</p>

There is a good Harbour before it, made by a ſmall Iſland, or Rock rather, juſt in its Mouth; which makes it very Commodious.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1676</label> ſent to all the chief Towns in the Country, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>Mexico,</hi> where, tho' but a hungry ſort of Food, they are mightily eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>The Account I have given of the <hi>Campeachy</hi> Rivers, &amp;c. was the reſult of the particular Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I made in cruiſing about that Coaſt, in which I ſpent 11 or 12 Months. For when the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Storm,</hi> before-mentioned took us, I was but juſt ſettling to Work, and not having a ſtock of Wood to purchaſe ſuch Proviſion as was ſent from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> as the old <hi>Standards</hi> had; I, with many more in my circumſtances, was forced to range about to ſeek a ſubſiſtance in Company of ſome Privateers then in the Bay. In which rambles we viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Rivers, from <hi>Triſt</hi> to <hi>Alvarado;</hi> and made many Deſcents into the County among the Villages there, where we got Indian-Corn to eat with the Beef, and other Fleſh that we got by the way, or Manatee and Turtle, which was alſo a great ſupport to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alvarado</hi> was the Weſtermoſt place I was at Thither we went in two Barks with 30 Men in each and had 10 or 11 kill'd and deſperately wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in taken the Fort; being four or five Hours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in that Service, in which time the Inhabitants having plenty of Boats and Canoas, carried all their Riches and beſt Moveables away. It was after Sun-ſet before the Fort yielded; and growing dark, we could not purſue them, but reſted quietly that Night; the next day we kill'd, ſalted and ſent aboard 20 or 30 Beefs, and a good quanity of Salt-fiſh, and Indian Corn, as much as we could ſtow away. Here were but few Hogs, and thoſe eat very fiſhy, therefore we did not much eſteem them: but of Cocks, Hens and Ducks were ſent aboard in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. The tame Parrots we found here were the largeſt and faireſt Birds of their kind that I ever ſaw in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Their colour was yellow
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0799400300:326"/>
and red, very courſly mixt; and they would prate very prettily; and there was ſcarce a Man but what ſent aboard one or two of them. So that with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, Cheſts, Hen-Coops and Parrot-Cages, our Ships were full of Lumber, with which we intended to ſail: But the ſecond Day after we took the Fort, having had a Weſterly Wind all the Morning, with Rain, 7 Armadilloes that were ſent from <hi>La Verd Cruz</hi> appeared in ſight, within a Mile of the Bars, coming in with full ſail; but they could ſcarce ſtem the Current of the River; which was very well for us; for we were not a little ſurprized. Yet we got under ſail, in order to meet them; and clearing our Decks by heaving all the Lumber over-board, we drove out over the Bar, before they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: But they being to Wind-ward, forced us to exchange a few ſhot with them. Their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was called the <hi>Toro.</hi> She had 10 Guns and 100 Men; another had 4 Guns and 80 Men: The reſt having no great Guns, had only 60 or 70 Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, armed with Muſkets, and the Veſſels barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed round with Bull-hides Breaſt high. We had not above 50 Men in both Ships, 6 Guns in one and two in the other. Aſſoon as we were over the Bar, we got our Larboard-Tacks aboard and ſtood to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as nigh the Wind as we could lye. The Spaniards came away quartering on us; and our Ship being the Head-moſt, the <hi>Toro</hi> came directly towards us, deſigning to board us. We kept firing at her, in hopes to have lamed either Maſt or Yard; but failing, juſt as ſhe was ſhearing aboard, we gave her a good Volley, and preſently clapp'd the Helm a Weather, wore our Ship, and got our Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tacks aboard, and ſtood to the Weſtward; and ſo left the <hi>Toro,</hi> but were ſaluted by all the ſmall Craft as we paſt by them, who ſtood to the Eaſtward after the <hi>Toro,</hi> that was now in purſuit and cloſe by our Conſort. We ſtood to the Weſtward
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0799400300:327"/>
till we were againſt the River's Mouth; then we tackt, and by the help of the Current that came out of the River, we were near a Mile to Wind-ward of them all. Then we made ſail to aſſiſt our Conſort, who was hard put to it; but on our approach the <hi>Toro</hi> edged away towards the Shore, as did all the reſt, and ſtood away for <hi>Alvarado:</hi> And we, glad of the Deliverance, went away to the Eaſtward, and viſited all the Rivers in our return again to <hi>Triſt;</hi> and ſearched the Bays for <hi>Munjack</hi> to carry with us for the Ship's uſe, as we had done before for the uſe both of Ships and Canoa's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Munjack</hi> is a ſort of Pitch or Bitumen, which we find in Lumps, from three or four pounds to thirty pounds in a lump; waſhed up by the Sea, and left dry on all the Sandy-Bays on all this Coaſt: It is in Subſtance like Pitch, but blacker; it melts by the Heat of the Sun, and runs abroad as Pitch would do if expoſed, as this is, on the Bays: The ſmell of it is not ſo pleaſant as Pitch, neither does it ſtick ſo firmly as Pitch, but it is apt to peel off from the Seams of Ships Bottoms; however we find it very uſeful here where we want Pitch; and becauſe it is commonly mixed with Sand by lying on the Bays, we melt it and refine it very well before we uſe it; and commonly temper it with Oyl or Tallow to correct it; for though it melts by the heat of the Sun, yet it is of a harſher Nature than Pitch. I did never find the like in any other Part of the World, neither can I tell from whence it comes.</p>
                  <p>And now the Effects of the late Storm being almoſt forgot, the Lagune Men ſettled again to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and I among the reſt fell to Work in the Eaſt Lagune, where I remained till my departure for <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0799400300:328"/>
I will only add as to this Logwood-Trade in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that I take it to be one of the moſt profitable to <hi>England,</hi> and it neareſt reſembles that of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland;</hi> ſince what ariſes from both, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of bare Labour; and that the Perſons imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein are ſupported by the Produce of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country.</p>
                  <p>It is not my Buſineſs to determine how far we might have a right of cutting Wood there, but this I can ſay, that the Spaniards never receive leſs Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from the Perſons who generally follow that Trade, than when they are employed upon that Work.</p>
                  <p>While I was here the laſt time, Capt. <hi>Gibbs</hi> arriv'd in a Ship of about 100 Tuns, and brought with him 20 ſtout <hi>New-England Indians</hi> that were taken in the Wars there, deſigning to have ſold them at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> but not finding a good Market, brought them hither to cut Logwood, and hired one Mr. <hi>Richard Dawkins</hi> to be their Overſeer, who carried them to work at <hi>Summaſenta:</hi> But it ſo happened that about a Week after, the Captain came thither in his Boat from <hi>One-Buſh-Key</hi> where his Ship lay, and the Overſeer having ſome Buſineſs, deſired leave to be abſent for two or three Days: But as ſoon as he and the Seamen were gone, the Indians taking their Opportunity killed the Captain and marched off, deſigning to return to their own Country by Land: They were ſeen about a Month afterward, and one of them was taken near the River <hi>Tondelo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I had ſpent about ten or twelve Months at the Logwood Trade, and was grown pretty well acquainted with the way of Traffick here, I left the Imployment, yet with a deſign to return hither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had been in <hi>England;</hi> and accordingly went from hence with Captain <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> bound to <hi>Jamaica.</hi> We ſailed from <hi>Triſt</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0799400300:329"/>
ginning of <hi>April,</hi> 1678. and arrived at <hi>Jamaica</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> where I remained a ſmall time, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for <hi>England</hi> with Captain <hi>Leader</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> I arriv'd there the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſame Year: and at the beginning of the following Year, I ſet out again for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> in order to have gone thence to <hi>Campeachy;</hi> but it proved to be a Voyage round the World, of which the Publick has already had an Account, in my former Volume, and the Firſt Part of This.</p>

                     <p>I Shall reduce what I have to ſay on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſome general Heads; beginning with the Trade-winds, as being the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>Trade-Winds are ſuch as do blow conſtantly from one Point or Quarter of the Compaſs, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0799400300:335"/>
the Region of the World moſt peculiar to them is from about 30 d. North, to 30 d. South of the Equator.</p>
                     <p>There are divers ſorts of theſe Winds; ſome blowing from Eaſt to Weſt, ſome from South to North, others from Weſt to Eaſt, &amp;c. Some are conſtant in one Quarter all the Year; ſome blow one half the Year one way, and the other ſix Months quite contrary; and others blow ſix Months one way, and then ſhifting only eight or ten Points, continue ſix Months more, and then return again to their former Stations, as all theſe ſhifting Trade-Winds do; and ſo as the Year comes about, they alternately ſucceed each other in their proper Seaſons.</p>
                     <p>There are other ſorts, called Sea-Winds and Land-winds, differing much from any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the one blowing by Day, the other by Night, conſtantly and regularly ſucceeding each other.</p>
                     <p>Within the Torrid Zone alſo are violent Storms, as fierce, if not fiercer, than any are in other Parts of the World. And as to the Seaſons of the Year, I can diſtinguiſh them there, no other way than by <hi>Wet</hi> and <hi>Dry;</hi> and theſe wet and dry Seaſons do as ſucceſſively follow each other, as Winter and Summer do with us.</p>
                     <p>Here are alſo ſtrong Currents, ſometimes ſetting one way, ſometimes another; which though it is hard to deſcribe, with that accuracy which is deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet I ſhall give as particular an Account of them, as alſo of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Winds,</hi> as my own Obſervations, and the Judicious Informations from others, will afford me Matter to do.</p>

                     <p>Of all Winds before-mentioned, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to treat diſtinctly; beginning with the <hi>True</hi> Trade-VVind
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0799400300:336"/>
firſt, which I call the <hi>General</hi> Trade-VVind at Sea; becauſe all other Trade-VVinds, whether conſtant or ſhifting, ſeem to have their dependance on ſome accidental Cauſe; whereas the Cauſe of theſe, be it what it will, ſeems uniformand conſtant.</p>
                     <p>Theſe General Trade-VVinds are only in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick Ocean which parts <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>America,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Ocean, and in the <hi>Great South-Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all theſe Seas, except juſt under or near the Line, they conſtantly blow without Intermiſſion, as well to the South, as to the North of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, but not with equal force at all Times, nor in all Latitudes; Neither do theſe conſtant Trade-VViuds uſually blow near the ſhoar, but only in the Ocean, at leaſt 30 or 40 Leagues off at Sea, clear from any Land; eſpecially on the VVeſt Coaſt, or ſide of any Continent: For indeed on the Eaſt ſide, The Eaſterly VVind being the true Trade-VVind, blows almoſt home to the ſhore; ſo near as to receive a check from the Land-VVind; and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to admit of the Sea-Breez, by which it is drawn from its Courſe frequently 4 or 5 Points of the Compaſs: But of the Sea-Breez I ſhall ſpeak in its place.

Wind in 40 d. or go out of our Channel with a North Eaſt Wind; which ſometimes alſo fails us not till we come into a true Trade-wind; but this is only accidental, therefore is not the Wind that I ſpeak of; but between 32 and 28 I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know nor hear, that the true Trade-wind failed.</p>
                     <p>If in coming from <hi>England,</hi> we have a North Eaſterly Wind that brings us hither (<hi>i. e.</hi> into the true Trade-wind) it ſometimes ſtays at North Eaſt, eſpecially if we keep near the <hi>African</hi> Shore, as <hi>Guinea</hi> Ships do, till we are near the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and then comes to the E. N. E. where it ſettles; but commonly it ſettles there in 28 d. if we are ſo far off Shore as to receive the true Trade. VVhen the VVind is thus ſettled, we have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fair Weather, and a clear Sky, eſpecially if the Sun is in any Southern Sign; but if in a Northern Sign, the Weather is uſually cloudy.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, when we are in South Lat. in the Atlantick, if the Sun is in Northern Signs, the Sky is clear, but if in Southern Signs, the Sky is cloudy. This I once experienced to my ſorrow, in my return from <hi>Bantam,</hi> in the Year 1671. VVe had cloudy VVeather and briſk VVinds, while we were croſſing the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Ocean and had a very good Paſſage alſo about the <hi>Cape of good Hope;</hi> where we had fair clear VVeather; And ſteering from thence, for the Iſland St. <hi>Hellena,</hi> where we thought to VVater and refreſh, as all our <hi>Engliſh Eaſt India</hi> Ships do, we miſt it for want of an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi> For before we came to the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the Sky was again clouded, ſo that we ſeldom ſaw the Sun or Stars, till we were quite paſt the <hi>Iſland.</hi> However we found the Iſle of <hi>Aſcention,</hi> where we ſtruck two Turtle, (for this was not the laying time, but the beginning of the <hi>Cooting</hi> or Ingendring Seaſon; therefore ſome few
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0799400300:338"/>
only were drawn hither.) This was the latter end of <hi>November.</hi> From the time that we thought our ſelves to the VVeſt of St. <hi>Hellena,</hi> we had our VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſured out to us, 2 Pints a Man <hi>per</hi> day, till we came into our Channel. This was the firſt time that I began to know the value of freſh VVater; for we took in none in all our way home from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi> But ſo much for this Digreſſion.</p>
                     <p>The VVinds, as I ſaid before, as we run to the Southward from <hi>England,</hi> do firſt ſettle in the E. N. E. about the Lat. of 28d. or be ſure between that and 24d. eſpecially when the Sun is to the Southward of the Line; but in <hi>May, June</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> you will find the Winds at E. by S. or E. S. E.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Winds, whether we meet them to the North of the Eaſt, or to the South of it, we find blowing a moderate Gale from our firſt meeting them in 30 or 28d. till we come to the Tropick, there we find the Trade ſtronger: It commonly blows a good Topſail-gale, as we ſail large: And if we were to ſail on a Wind, our lower Sails would be enough.</p>
                     <p>Theſe briſk Gales blow in the Atlantick Ocean, and North of the Equator, from the Lat. of 23 to 12 or 14 conſtantly, between the E. N. E. and the E. but between 10 or 12 degrees and the Line, they are not ſo freſh nor conſtant, to that Point; for in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the South Winds do oft times blow even to 11d. or 12d. of North Lat. keeping between the S. S. E. and the S. S. W. or S. W. but in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January</hi> the true Trade blows within 3d. or 4d. of the Equator. And as the Sun returns again to the Northward, ſo the Southerly Winds do increaſe and draw more to the Northward of the Line, till <hi>July,</hi> and them gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally withdraw back again towards the Line: VVhen the Sun is in Southern Signs, 'tis the beſt time of the Year to croſs the Line, if bound to the Southward;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0799400300:339"/>
for beſides the benefit of the true Trade, to bring a Ship near the Line, the Wind is then more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and freſh, the Weather clearer, and the Winds which at other times are between the S. S. E. and S. S. W. are now at S. E. or S. E. and by E. but in our Summer Months we find nothing but Calms and Tornadoes; and tho' Tornadoes do uſually riſe againſt the ſettled Wind; yet but few Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will endeavour to take the Advantage of the Winds that come from them, but rather furl their Topſails, hall up their Corſes, and lye ſtill till the guſt of Wind is paſt, except neceſſity requires haſte; for the ſudden Tornadoes do not continue long; and beſides often very violent and fierce, ſo that a Ship with her ſails looſe, would be in danger to be over-ſet by them, or at leaſt loſe Maſts or Yards, or have the Sails ſplit; beſides the Conſternation that all Men muſt needs be in at ſuch a time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Ship, by any unforeſeen accident, ſhould prove unruly, as by the miſtake of the Man at Helm, or he that Conns, or by her broaching to againſt all endeavours, which often happens when a fierce guſt comes; which tho' it does not laſt long, yet would do much damage in a ſhort time; and tho' all things ſhould fall out well, yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it would not compenſate the danger: For 'tis much if a Ship ſails a Mile before either the Wind dyes wholly away, or at leaſt ſhifts about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the South. Nor are we ſure that theſe Winds will continue 3 Minutes before they ſhift; and ſometimes they fly round faſter than the Ship will, tho' the Helm lies for it; and all Seamen know the danger of being taken a-back in ſuch Weather.</p>
                     <p>But what has been ſpoken of the Southerly Winds, Calms, and Tornadoes is to be underſtood of the Eaſt ſide of the Atlantick to as far Weſt as the Longitude of 359d. or thereabouts; for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weſterly we find the Winds commonly at S.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0799400300:340"/>
E. even in croſſing the Line, and a very briſk gale; 'tis for that reaſon our experienced <hi>Guinea</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders do keep to the Southward of the Line, till they are about that Longitude. Some run over nearer the <hi>American</hi> Shore before they croſs the Line; Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Commanders do alſo croſs the Line, coming from <hi>India</hi> near the <hi>American</hi> Coaſt, and find briſk Gales at S. E. all the times of the Year; but going to the <hi>Indies,</hi> they ſteer away South, from the Iſland St. <hi>Jago,</hi> where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Water and meet the Winds in that Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But of this enough.</p>
                     <p>The Winds near the Line in the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean and South Sea are different from this, yet there the Winds are alſo Southerly and therefore different from what they are farther off, for 2 d. or 3d. on each ſide the Line, the Winds are commonly very uncertain, and oftentimes there are perfect Calms, or at leaſt very ſmall Winds and ſome Tornadoes in the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Sea. In the <hi>South Seas,</hi> near and under the Line, the Winds are at South 130 Leagues off from the Shoar, but how farther off I know not; there the Winds are but ſmall, yet conſtant, and the Weather clear from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>September;</hi> but about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> there are Torna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; yet in both the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Sea, and the <hi>South Sea,</hi> the Winds near or under the Line, are often at South; yet theſe Winds do not blow above 2 or 3 d. to the North or South of the Line, except near ſome Land; but in the Atlantick Sea, as I have ſaid before, the South and South Weſt Winds do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blow even to 10 or 12 d. North of the Line. And for the South Winds to blow conſtantly near the Line in the Atlantick, between <hi>Cape Verd</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and <hi>C. Blanco</hi> in <hi>Brazil,</hi> is no wonderful thing, if a Man will but conſider thoſe Promontories that ſhoot out from the Continents on each ſide the Sea; one on the North, the other on the South ſide of the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0799400300:341"/>
leaving but a ſmall ſpace clear for the Winds to blow in; where there is always a pretty briſk Gale, eſpecially on the <hi>American</hi> ſide. And as within 2 or 3 d. of the Equator, it is moſt ſubject to Calms and Tornadoes and ſmall faint Breezes in other Seas not pend up as this is. So this Sea, except juſt in the very opening between both Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is much more ſubject to it than any other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially on the Eaſt ſide: that is, from the Bite or the Inland corner of the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> to 28 or 30 d. diſtance Weſt: But this ſeems not to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the effects of the Line, but owing partly to the nearneſs of the Land to the Line, which ſhoots out from the Bite of <hi>Guinea,</hi> even to <hi>Cape St. Anns,</hi> almoſt in a parallel with the Equator (allowing for the Bays and Bendings) and this is 23 or 24 d. of Longitude, and not above 80 Leagues from the Line in ſome Places: So that this part of the Sea between the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> and the Line or 2 d. South of it, lying, as it were, between the Land and the Line, is ſeldom free from bad Weather; eſpecially from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>September;</hi> but when the Sun is withdrawn towards the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> then there is ſomething better Weather there.</p>
                     <p>And in the Sea under the Line between the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Promontory and the <hi>American,</hi> it is free from Tornadoes and Calms, and more ſubject to fair Weather and freſh Breezes. Therefore both our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Ships, when outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, endeavour to Croſs the Line as near as they can in the mid Channel, between both Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; and although they meet the Winds ſome times at S. S. E. or at S. S. W. or farther Eaſterly or VVeſterly; yet will they not run above a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Eaſt, or a degree to the VVeſt of the mid Channel, before they tack again, for fear of meeting with the ſoaking Current on the VVeſt, or Calms on the Eaſt ſide; either of which would be alike prejudicial to their Courſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0799400300:342"/>
The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in their Voyages to <hi>Brazil,</hi> take the ſame method, and get to the South of the Line before they fall in with the Land, for fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leward of <hi>Cape St. Auguſtine,</hi> for there are ſo many things which make that a difficult Cape to paſs, that hardly any Man would try to do it, but at a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>But our <hi>Guinea</hi> Ships do generally paſs on to their Ports on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> at any time of the Year, without uſing ſuch Methods; becauſe their Buſineſs lies moſtly on the North of the Line, where they always find a fair VVeſterly VVind. But in their returns from thence, they croſs the Line, and run 3 or 4d. to the Southward of it, where they meet the Wind between the S. S. E. and the S. S. W. and a briſk gale: with this VVind, they run away in the ſame parallel 35 or 36 d. before they croſs the Line again to the Northward, which is about midway between the Extreams of both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories, there they find a briſk gale, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> or where they pleaſe. Some run VVeſt 40 d. before they croſs the Line, and find ſtrong Gales; whereas ſhould they come from <hi>Old Callabar,</hi> or any other Place in the <hi>Bite,</hi> on the North of the Line, and ſteer away VVeſt, thinking to gain their Paſſage the ſooner becauſe it is the neareſt way, they would doubtleſs be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, as many Men have been: For if they keep near the Line, they meet with great Calms; and if they keep near the Land, they meet with VVeſterly VVinds; and if they keep in the middle between both, they muſt of neceſſity meet with both Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, as alſo with Tornadoes, eſpecially in <hi>May, June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By which means ſome Ships, if they go any of theſe three ways now cautioned againſt, ſpend more time in going from the <hi>Bite</hi> to <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ship will do if it croſs the Line in the right
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0799400300:343"/>
Places before-mentioned, in going to the <hi>Barbadoes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes unexperienced <hi>Guinea</hi> Maſters in their return from thence, after they have croſs'd the Line from N. to S. and are in a fair way to gain a ſpeedy Paſſage, will be ſo obſtinate in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after they have run 26, 28 or 30 d. Weſt from <hi>Old Callabar</hi> (with a fair Wind) to ſteer away W. by N. or W. N. W. it being the directeſt Courſe they can ſteer for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> then they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity keep within a degree of the Line, while they are running 2 or 300 Leagues, which may prove to be a long time in doing, becauſe of the uncertainty of the Winds near the Equator; therefore they that croſs it near the middle, between both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories, or near the <hi>American</hi> Coaſt, when they are minded to fall away to the Northward, ſteer away N. W. or N. W. by N. and ſo depreſs or raiſe a degree in running 28 Leagues at moſt; therefore (which is beſt) they are but a ſhort time near the Equator: And beſides, in thus croſſing it in the middle between both Promontories, they ſeldom miſs of a Wind: for the Wind in theſe Seas has no other Paſſage, but between theſe two Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid already on this Head, has been chiefly of the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> and of that too moſtly about the Line, becauſe it is the moſt difficult Place to paſs in going to the Southward. In other Seas, as in the <hi>Eaſt-India Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Great South Sea</hi> there is no ſuch difficulty to paſs any way, becauſe there is Sea-room enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming into ſuch Inconveniencies, as we meet with in the Atlantick; and as to the Winds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Line and the Tropicks, in the <hi>Eaſt-Indian Sea</hi> and the <hi>South Sea,</hi> they are in their Latitudes, as I ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> in South Latitude, at E. S. E and in North Lat. at E. N. E. blowing conſtantly freſh Breezes, eſpecially in the South Seas, even
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0799400300:344"/>
from within a degree or two of the Line, on each ſide to the Tropick, or to 30 degrees of Lat. And this I may truly ſay, That neither the Atlantick nor the <hi>Eaſt-Indian Seas</hi> have the true Trade-Winds ſo conſtant nor briſk at all times of the Year, and in all Latitudes, as they are here. For being once got in the Trade, I mean without the verge of the coaſting Trade-Wind, it blows a very briſk gale all over the Ocean. Capt. <hi>Eaton</hi> experienced this in ſailing from the <hi>Gallapagos</hi> Iſlands to the <hi>Ladrones,</hi> in the latter end of the Year 1685. We had the like experience, ſailing from <hi>Cape Corientes</hi> to <hi>Guam</hi> the Year after (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by my Journal of that Run, in my Voyage round the World. Chap. 10. Pag. 185.) And as for the Wind to the Southward of the Line, I had great Experience of it in my ramble there with Capt. <hi>Sharp;</hi> and ſince that Capt. <hi>Davis,</hi> in his return out of the South Sea, had greater Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe he took his departure from the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapagos</hi> Iſlands alſo, and ſteering W. S. W. from thence, till he met the True Trade at E. S. E. he ſteered directly South, clear from the Line, till he got to the Southward of the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and ſo quite without the Trade.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Sea, between the Lat of 30 d. and 4 degrees South of the Equator, the true Breez is at E. S. E. or S. E. by E. yet not ſo conſtant nor briſk as in the South Seas; beſides that part of it which lyes to the Northward of the Line, has not ſuch a conſtant ſteady Breez, but is more ſubject to Calms, and near the ſhoar to ſhifting Winds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Seaſons of the Year.</p>

                  <p>The South part of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> are in one Lat. both Coaſts trending North and South; both on the Weſt ſide of their Continents; both in South Lat. and tho' they do not lye exactly parallel, by Reaſon of ſome Capes or Bendings in the Land, yet are the Winds much alike on both Coaſts, all the Year long.</p>
                  <p>On the Coaſt of <hi>Angola</hi> the Winds are between the S. VV. and S. And on the Coaſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them between the S. S. VV. and S. S. E. But this the Reader muſt take notice of, That the Trade-winds that blow on any Coaſt, except the North Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> whether they are conſtant, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0799400300:346"/>
blow all the Year, or whether they are ſhifting VVinds, do never blow right in on the Shoar, nor right along Shoar; but go ſlanting, making an accute Angle of about 22 degrees. Therefore as the Land trends more Eaſterly or VVeſterly from the North or South on theſe Coaſts, ſo the VVinds do alter accordingly; as for example, where the Land lies N. and S. the VVind would be at S. S. VV. but where the Land lies S. S. W. the Trade would be at S. VV. But if the Land lies S. S. E. then the Wind would be at South. This is ſuppoſed of Coaſts lying on the VVeſt ſide of any Continent, and on the South ſide of the Equator, as the two Coaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> are; but the North part of <hi>Africa</hi> has the Trade blowing off from the ſhoar, two or three Points.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Southerly VVinds do blow conſtantly all the Year long, on both the Coaſts of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica;</hi> they are briſk, and blow farther off from the Coaſts than any ſhifting Winds.</p>
                  <p>On the Coaſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> theſe VVinds blow 140 or 150 Leagues off Shore, before you can perceive them to alter; But then as you run farther off, ſo the Wind will come about more Eaſterly, and at about 200 Leagues diſtance it ſettles at E. S. E. which is the true Trade.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Angola</hi> and <hi>Brazil</hi> the Winds are much as they are in the South Seas, on the Weſt ſide of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Coaſt; only near the Line, within 4 degrees of it, in South Lat. the Wind holds in the S. S. W. or S. W. for 28 or 30 d. of Longitude, and ſo it may in the ſame Lat. in the South Seas, for ought I know; for it was at South, as far as any of us were, which was 200 Leagues.</p>
                  <p>As the Coaſts of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Angola</hi> have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Trade-winds, ſo has the Coaſt of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Guinea.</hi> And as the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> lies North and South, ſo thoſe lye nearer Eaſt and Weſt.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0799400300:347"/>
According to the Courſe of the general Trade the Winds ſhould be Eaſterly on theſe Coaſts; but here we meet with the quite contrary; for from the Lat. of 10 d. North to 20 d. North on the Coaſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Winds are conſtantly near the Weſt on all the Coaſt, except check'd ſometimes with Tornadoes, which do commonly riſe againſt the Wind, the ſame is obſerved on the Coaſt of <hi>Ango<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> where there are Tornadoes alſo: But the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> is not ſubject to any, yet on that Coaſt there are ſometimes Calms two or three days together off of the Bay of <hi>Arica,</hi> between the Lat. of 16 and 23. In the Lat. of 19 you ſhall have Calms 30 or 40 Leagues off Shore, but not ſo far on either ſide the Bay, neither are ſuch Calms uſual on the Coaſts of <hi>Angola</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi> only after a Tornado, as is common in other Places.</p>
                  <p>As the Coaſts of <hi>Angola</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> do in moſt things run parallel each with other; ſo do the Coaſts of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Guinea:</hi> And if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, the VVinds on both theſe Coaſts are much alike; Both theſe Coaſts do begin at the Bite or Bending of the Land, where the other two Parallel Lands do end; for as the <hi>Mexican</hi> Continent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at or near <hi>Panama,</hi> which is 8 or 9 degrees North of the Equator; ſo that part of <hi>Guinea,</hi> which I ſpeak of, begins about <hi>Old Callabar,</hi> in about 4 or 5 degrees of North Lat.</p>
                  <p>The Land trends away VVeſterly from both theſe Places ſome hundreds of Leagues; and tho' not on one Point of the Compaſs, becauſe of the ſmall Points, Bays and Bending in the Land, yet the VVinds that on more regular Shores, keep their conſtant Courſe, and blow in upon the Shore, about two Points from the Sea, do alſo here on the <hi>Guinea</hi> Coaſt, blow on the Shore from the VVeſt Quarter, and as the Land lies pointing in on the Shore, even from <hi>Cape Mount</hi> to <hi>Old Callabar,</hi> which is above
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0799400300:348"/>
400 Leagues; and that with ſuch conſtancy that the Eaſt part of that Coaſt is called the <hi>Leeward Coaſt;</hi> and the Weſt part the <hi>Windward Coaſt;</hi> And yet this is ſo contrary to the general Opinion of Seamen, concerning the Courſe of the Winds, that nothing but their own Experience will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the Truth of it; for thus they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reaſon; <hi>Barbadoes</hi> is the Eaſter-moſt of the <hi>Carribbe</hi>-Iſlands, therefore the reſt are ſaid be to Leeward of it, and ſo of any other Iſland; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it uſually holds true, becauſe the Winds there are commonly at Eaſt; but this Counter Wind on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> aſtoniſhes moſt Seamen that have ſeen nothing like what they meet with here. There are other Coaſts where the Winds ſhift ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, as on the Coaſt of <hi>Carraccos,</hi> and the South ſide of the Bay of <hi>Mexico, i. e.</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Campechy,</hi> and all the <hi>Carribbe</hi> Iſlands. Indeed there may be ſometimes ſome ſmall flurts of a We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly VVind on theſe Coaſts, but neither conſtant, certain or laſting.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this was the great ſtumbling Block that we met with in running from the <hi>Gallapagos Iſlands</hi> for the Iſland <hi>Cocos,</hi> mentioned in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book, Chap. 5. Pag. 111.</p>
                  <p>But that part of <hi>Africa,</hi> which lies between <hi>Cape Verd</hi> in 14d. North, and <hi>Cape Bayedore</hi> in 27. has commonly Northerly Winds; or between the N. and N. E. very freſh gales; therefore our <hi>Guinea</hi> Ships, bound to <hi>Guinea</hi> ſtrive to keep near that Shore, and oft times make the Capes: And being to the Southward of <hi>Cape Blanco,</hi> which lyes in Lat. about 21. they are ſometimes ſo troubled with the Sand, which the Wind brings off Shore, that they are ſcarce able to ſee one another: Their Decks are alſo ſtrewed with it, and their Sails all red, as if they were tanned with the Sand that ſticks to them, it being of a reddiſh colour.</p>

From <hi>Cape Verd</hi> to <hi>Cape St. Anns,</hi> which is about 6 degrees North, the Trade is between the E. and S. E. from <hi>Cape St. Anns,</hi> to <hi>Cape Palmas,</hi> in about 4 d.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Coaſts where the VVinds do uſually ſhift, are ſome in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> as that part of the Coaſt between <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios,</hi> and <hi>Cape La Vera</hi> chiefly: The Coaſt of <hi>Brazil;</hi> the Bay of <hi>Panama</hi> in the South Seas, and all the Coaſt of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> even from the River <hi>Natal,</hi> which is in the Lat. of 30d. South, on the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Africa,</hi> beyond the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> to the North-Eaſt Parts of <hi>China,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all the Bays between. The Iſlands alſo have their Annual changes; Of all theſe I ſhall treat in their order, beginning firſt with that Coaſt which lyes between <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios</hi> and <hi>Cape La Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:</hi> And I the rather begin with this part firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this part of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> is all that is ſubject to change; neither is the change altogether
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0799400300:351"/>
ſo orderly, or certain as the <hi>Monſoons</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or the ſhifting Winds on the Coaſt of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Common Trade-Wind on this Coaſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweea the N. E. and the Eaſt; This Trade blows conſtantly from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>November,</hi> but is often check'd with Tornadoes in the Months of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> eſpecially between the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Darien</hi> and <hi>Coſtarica;</hi> but to Wind-ward there is a more ſerene Air, and a brisker Wind: From <hi>October</hi> till <hi>March</hi> there are Weſterly Winds, not conſtant, nor violent, but blowing moderately ſometimes 2 or 3 Days or a Week; and then the Breez may blow again as long. Theſe VVinds are moſt in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January;</hi> before and after theſe two Months the Trade-VVind is only check'd a Day or two near the full or change of the Moon; and when the VVeſterly VVinds blow longeſt and ſtrongeſt on the Coaſt, the Eaſterly Trade-wind blows off at Sea, as at other times. Near <hi>Cape La Vela,</hi> the true Trade blows within 8 or 10 Leagues off the Shore, when the Weſterly Winds blow on the Coaſt, except in a ſtrong North, which turns the Trade-Wind back, and on the <hi>Coſtorica,</hi> and between it and the River <hi>Darien,</hi> the Weſterly Winds, as they are more frequent and laſting, than toward <hi>Cape La Vela,</hi> ſo alſo they blow farther of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> at Sea, as ſometimes as far as to 20 or 30 Leagues from the Shore.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Ships bound to Windward, if they have far to go, either take the opportunity of the Weſterly Wind-Seaſon, or elſe go through the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> and ſtretch away to the North, till they get into a variable Winds way, and then run to the Eaſtward as far as they think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent before they ſtretch to the Southward again. All that are bound from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to <hi>Guinea</hi> muſt take this courſe, if they ſail from <hi>Jamaica</hi> (becauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0799400300:352"/>
they muſt paſs thro' the Gulph of <hi>Florida</hi>) but from other Iſlands they may ſtretch away directly to the North, and uſe the ſame method.</p>
                  <p>But if Ships have only a ſmall way to Sail to Wind-ward, they make uſe of the Sea and Land Breezes, making no account of the time of the Year.</p>
                  <p>The Winds on the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> are from <hi>September</hi> till <hi>March</hi> at E. N. E. and from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>September</hi> again they are at South.</p>
                  <p>The Winds in the Bay of <hi>Panama</hi> are from <hi>September</hi> till <hi>March</hi> Eaſterly, and from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>September</hi> again they are at S. and S. S. W.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> Eaſtwards, as far as the River <hi>Natal,</hi> which lies in 30 d. South Latitude, and <hi>Cape Corientes</hi> in Lat. of 24 degrees South, the Winds from <hi>May</hi> to <hi>October</hi> are conſtantly from the Weſt to the North Weſt within 30 Leagues of the Shore: They blow hardeſt at North Weſt. When the Wind comes to North Weſt, it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtormy and tempeſtuous Weather, attended with much Rain, and then the Weather is cold and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. From <hi>October</hi> till <hi>March</hi> the Winds are Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly from the E. N. E. to the E. S. E. you have then very fair Weather: The E. N. E. Winds are pretty freſh, but the Winds at E. S. E. are ſmall and faint, ſometimes affording ſome drops of Rain.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cape Corientes</hi> to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> from <hi>October</hi> till the middle of <hi>January</hi> the Winds are variable, but moſt times Northerly, and oft ſhifting round the Compaſs: The ſtrongeſt Winds are at North; theſe are often very violent and ſtormy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with much Rain, and thus it blows about the Iſland of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> and the adjacent Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtorms are commonly preceded by a great Sea out of the North. From <hi>January</hi> till <hi>May</hi> the Winds are at N. E. or N. N. E. ſine freſh gales and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0799400300:353"/>
fair VVeather. From <hi>May</hi> till <hi>October</hi> the VVind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are Southerly, in <hi>July, Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi> then are great Calms in the Bay of <hi>Pate</hi> and <hi>Melende,</hi> and a ſtrong Current ſetting into the Bay: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ships that have occaſion to paſs this way in thoſe three Months, ought to keep at leaſt 100 Leagues from the Coaſt to avoid being driven by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent into the Bay; for theſe Calms do ſometimes laſt 6 Weeks, yet off at Sea, at the diſtance of 100 Leagues the Winds are freſh a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> South. At the entrance into the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> near <hi>Cape Guardefuer</hi> there are commonly very hard gales and turbulent Weather, even when the Calms are ſo great in the Bay of <hi>Melende,</hi> and not above 10 or 12 Leagues at Sea from the ſaid <hi>Cape,</hi> there is alſo very fair Weather, and pretty freſh Gales.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> from <hi>May</hi> till <hi>October,</hi> the Winds are ſtrong at S. VV. and the Current ſetting out ſtrong, ſo that there is no entring into that Sea in thoſe Months, except you keep cloſe to the South Shore, there you have Land-VVinds, and an eddy Current. In the Months of <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> the VVind ſhuffles about to the North, and at laſt ſettles at N. E. then comes fair VVeather on this Coaſt; and ſo continues till the <hi>Monſoon</hi> ſhifts, which is in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May;</hi> then it firſt takes one flurry at North, and from thence veers to the Eaſt, and ſo about to the South, and there it ſettles.</p>
                  <p>The Account of this Coaſt from the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> hither, I had from Capt. <hi>Rogers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this hither-moſt part of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> even from the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> which Coaſt lies neareſt N. E. and S. VV. hath its ſhifting Seaſons, ſo the other Parts of <hi>India,</hi> from the Gulph of <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Cape Comorin,</hi> has its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Annual change, and from <hi>Comorin,</hi> clear round the Bay of <hi>Bengal,</hi> the change is no leſs; and even from thence, through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0799400300:354"/>
and Eaſtwards as far as <hi>Japan,</hi> the ſhifting Trade-Winds do alternately ſucceed each other as duly as the Year comes about.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that the Trade-Wind in all theſe Places, ſhould be exactly on one Point of the Compaſs: For I have already ſhown, that theſe Trade-Winds on any Coaſt do commonly blow ſlanting in on the Shore about 2 or 3 Points; therefore in Bays where the Land lies on ſeveral Rombs, the Winds muſt alter accordingly. Tho' that Rule does not hold altogether true in Bays that are deep, but is chiefly meant for a pretty ſtreight Coaſt, which lies near alike; allowing for Points of Land and ſmall Coves, which make no alteration: But on the ſides and in the bottom of large Bays, ſuch as the Bay of <hi>Bengall,</hi> the Bay of <hi>Siam,</hi> &amp;c. the VVind differs much on one ſide of the Bay from what it does on the other; and both ſides differ from the conſtant Trade on the open Coaſt; yet all ſhift in the ſhifting Seaſons, which are <hi>April</hi> and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> at one and the ſame time, to their oppoſite Points: I mean on the open Coaſt, for in ſome Bays there is a little alteration from that general Rule.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſhifting VVinds in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Monſoons;</hi> one is called the Eaſt <hi>Monſoon,</hi> the other the VVeſt <hi>Monſoon.</hi> The Eaſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> ſets in about <hi>September</hi> and blows till <hi>April;</hi> then ceaſeth, and the VVeſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> takes place and blows till <hi>September</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>And both the Eaſt and VVeſt <hi>Monſoons</hi> blow in their Seaſons ſlanting in on the Coaſt, as is before deſcribed: The Eaſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> brings fair VVeather; the VVeſt brings Tornadoes and Rain. For, (as I ſaid before in the firſt Chap. of the General Trade-VVind at Sea) when the Sun comes to the North of the Linethen all Places North of the Equator, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Tropicks, are troubled with Clouds and Rain, but when the Sun is in Southern Signs then the Sky is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0799400300:355"/>
clear. And as moſt of the Trading Countries in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially thoſe on the Main Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, do lye between the Line and the Tropick of <hi>Cancer:</hi> So theſe Countries are all ſubject to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Seaſons already deſcribed. But the Iſlands lying under the Line, and to the South between the Line and the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> have contrary Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to theſe. Yet do they change at the ſelf-ſame time.</p>
                  <p>The difference between the <hi>Monſoons</hi> on the North of the Line, and the <hi>Monſoons</hi> on the South of the Line is that in <hi>April,</hi> when the Weſt <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon</hi> ſets in to the North of the Line, the S. S. W. VVinds ſets in to the South of the Lat. and is called the S. S. VV. <hi>Monſoon.</hi> And in <hi>September</hi> when the Eaſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> ſets in to the North of the Line, the N. N. E. VVind blows in South Lat. and is called the N. N. E. <hi>Monſoon.</hi> And whereas the Weſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> is accompanied with Tornadoes and Rain in North Lat. the S. S. W. <hi>Monſoon,</hi> which blows at the ſame time in South Lat. is accompanied with fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as the Eaſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> is attended with fair Weather in North Lat. the N. N. E. <hi>Monſoon,</hi> which blows at the ſame time in South Lat is attended with Tornadoes and very bad Weather. And tho' theſe Winds do not ſhift exactly at one time in all Years; yet <hi>Sept.</hi> and <hi>Apr.</hi> are always accounted the turning Months, and do commonly participate of both ſorts of Winds. For theſe <hi>Monſoons</hi> do as conſtantly ſhift by turns, as the Year comes about. And by means of this change of Wind, Ships have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to ſail from one part of <hi>India,</hi> with one Wind, and return with the contrary: So that moſt of the Navigation in <hi>India</hi> depends on the <hi>Monſoons.</hi> And Ships do conſtantly wait for theſe Changes; and the Merchants fit out to any Place according as the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year draws on: And whereſoever they go they certainly diſpatch their buſineſs ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0799400300:356"/>
back again with the next or contrary <hi>Monſoon:</hi> For here is no ſailing to and from any Place, but with the <hi>Monſoon;</hi> One carries them out, the other brings them back. Neither do I know how it were poſſible for Merchants in theſe Parts to Trade by Sea from one Country to another, were it not for theſe ſhifting <hi>Monſoons.</hi> For, as I have ſaid before, moſt of the Trading Kingdoms in <hi>India</hi> do lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Line, and the Tropick of <hi>Cancer.</hi> And the Land lies ſo to the North, that Ships cannot go to the North of the Tropick, and by that means get into variable Winds way; as they may and do in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> when they are bound far to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Neither could it be any advantage to ſtand off to Sea, as they may in the South Sea; for that would be of little moment, becauſe they would then come ſo near the Line, that they would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lyable to Tornadoes and Calms; and ſhould they croſs the Line and run to the Southward of it, thinking that way to gain their Paſſage, it is likely they might ſucceed no better there: For that part of the Sea which lies to the Southward of the Line is open and free to the true Trade, which ſeldom fails: But indeed that Wind would carry them to the Southward quite beyond the Trade into a variable VVinds-way. But the Sea is not open there, for Ships to paſs ſo far to the Eaſtward as to gain their Ports.</p>
                  <p>For our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships that are bound to <hi>Siam, Tunqueen, China,</hi> &amp;c. cannot get thither but in the Seaſon of the Weſt <hi>Monſoon,</hi> tho' they go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>England;</hi> and though, after they are paſt the <hi>Cape,</hi> they have the convenience to ſtretch to the Eaſtward, as far as the Land will permit, yet they cannot go ſo far as is convenient before they will be obliged to ſteer down within the Courſe of the Trade-Winds, which would obſtruct their Paſſage, if they were as conſtant here as in other Places. And therefore if theſe Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0799400300:357"/>
                     <hi>Monſoons</hi> did not conſtantly ſucceed each other, Ships could not paſs but one way; they might ſail to the Weſtward, but there they muſt lye up, or be 3 or 4 Years in their return from a place which may be failed in 6 Weeks, yet I ſay that to Places near each other, Ships may and do very often ſail againſt the <hi>Monſoon,</hi> and that with ſucceſs: For here are Sea and Land-Breezes under the ſhore, and in many Places good Anchoring, by which means Ships may ſtop when they find the Current againſt them: But Voyages of a great diſtance cannot be made only with Land and Sea-Winds without ſome other helps.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> we have theſe helps of Land-Winds and Sea-Breezes by which we ſail from one place to another, provided they are no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance aſunder, and perform our Voyages well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but when we are to ſail a great way to the Eaſtward againſt the Trade-Wind, then we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as is ſaid before, either to paſs thro' the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> if we are far to Leeward, or elſe to paſs between the Iſlands, and ſo ſtretch away to the Northward, till we are clear out of the Trade, and ſo get our Longitude that way. So in the South Seas alſo, and on the Coaſts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> the Coaſt of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> between the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> and the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> there are Sea and Land Breezes, which may be made uſe of to ſail againſt the Trade, if the Voyages be ſhort: But when we are to ſail a great way againſt the Trade-Wind, we muſt not wholly depend on the Sea and Land Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; for then we ſhould be a long time in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Voyages. In ſuch Caſes we have recourſe to other helps, ſuch as Providence has ſupplied theſe Seas with, which ſeems to be wanting in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> as for example, in the South Seas &amp; on the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> where the Sontherly Winds blow conſtantly all the Year, there Ships that are bound to the Southward ſtretch off to the Weſtward till they are out of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0799400300:358"/>
Coaſting Trade-Wind, and there meet with the true Trade at E. S. E. with which they ſail as far as they pleaſe to the Southward, and then ſteer in for their Port. So on the Coaſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> where the Coaſting Trade is weſterly, there they run off to Sea, till they meet the true E. N. E. Trade; and then ſtretch away to the Northward, as far as their Port; and Ships that come from the <hi>Philipines,</hi> bound for the Coaſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſtretch away to the North, as far as 40 degrees, to get a Wind to bring them on the Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo all Ships bound to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have paſt the Line in the Atlantick Ocean, ſtretch away to the Southward beyond the Trade, and then ſtand over to the Eaſtward, towards the Cape; ſo in returning home, after they have croſt the Line to the Northward, they ſteer away North, with the Wind at E. N. E. till they are to the Northward of the Trade-Wind, and then direct their Courſe Eaſterly. All <hi>Guinea</hi> Ships and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Ships do the ſame in their returns: And this is the Benefit of an open Sea. But to return.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Monſoons</hi> among the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Iſlands that lye to the Southward of the Line, as I ſaid before, are either at N. N. E. or S. S. W. Theſe alſo keep time, and ſhift, as the <hi>Monſoons</hi> do, to the North of the Line, in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> but near the Line, as a degree or two on each ſide, the Winds are not ſo conſtant. Indeed there they are ſo very uncertain, that I cannot be particular ſo as to give any true Account of them: Only this I know, that Calms are very frequent there, as alſo Tornadoes and ſudden Guſts; in which the Winds fly in a moment quite round the Compaſs.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>SEA-Breezes, generally ſpeaking, are no other than the Common Trade-Wind of the Coaſts on which they blow, with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that whereas all Trade-Winds, whether they are thoſe that I call the general Trade-Winds at Sea, or coaſting Trade-Winds, either conſtant or ſhifting, do blow as well by Night as by Day, with an equal briſkneſs, except when Tornadoes happen; So contrarily Sea-Winds are only in the Day, and ceaſe in the Night; and as all Trade-Winds blow conſtantly near to one Point of the Compaſs, both where the conſtant Trade-Winds are, or where they ſhift; on the contrary theſe Sea-Winds do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them in this, that in the Morning when they firſt ſpring up, they blow commonly as the Trade-Winds on the Coaſt do, at or near the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0799400300:360"/>
ſame Point of Compaſs; but about Mid-Day they fly off 2, 3 or 4 Points further from the Land, and ſo blow almoſt right in on the Coaſt, eſpecially in fair Weather; for then the Sea-Breezes are trueſt; as for inſtance, on the Coaſt of <hi>Argola</hi> the Land lies almoſt North and South, there the Trade-Wind is from the S. S. W. to the S. W. the true Sea-Breezes near the ſhore are at W. by S. or W. S. W. and ſo of any other Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sea-Breezes do commonly riſe in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about Nine a Clock, ſometimes ſooner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times later: they firſt approach the ſhore, ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if they were afraid to come near it, and of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they make ſome faint breathings, and as if not willing to offend, they make a halt, and ſeem ready to retire. I have waited many a time both aſhore to receive the pleaſure, and at Sea to take the benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>It comes in a fine, ſmall, black Curle upon the Water, when as all the Sea between it and the ſhore not yet reach'd by it, is as ſmooth and even as Glaſs in Compariſon; in half an Hour's time after it has reached the ſhore it fans pretty briſkly, and ſo increaſeth gradually till 12 a Clock, then it is commonly ſtrongeſt, and laſts ſo till 2 or 3 a very briſk gale; about 12 at Noon it alſo veers off to Sea 2 or 3 Points, or more in very fair Weather. After 3 a Clock it begins to dye away again, and gradually withdraws its force till all is ſpent, and about 5 a Clock, ſooner or later, according as the Weather is, it is lull'd aſleep, and comes no more till the next Morning.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Winds are as conſtantly expected as the day in their proper Latitudes, and ſeldom fail but in the wet Seaſon. On all Coaſts of the Main, whethre in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or <hi>Guinea,</hi> they riſe in the Morning, and withdraw towards the Evening, yet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0799400300:361"/>
Capes and Head-Lands have the greateſt benefit of them, where they are higheſt, riſe earlier, and blow later.</p>
                  <p>Bays contrarily have the diſadvantage, for there they blow but faintly at beſt, and their continuance is but ſhort. Iſlands that lye neareſt Eaſt and Weſt, have the benefit of theſe Winds on both ſides equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for if the Wind is at S. W. or S. W. and by S. on the South ſide of any Iſland, then on the North ſide it would be at N. W. or N. W. by N. <hi>i. e.</hi> in fair Weather; but if turbulent Weather it would be E. S. E. on the Southſide, and E. N. E. on the other: But this true Sea Breez does not veer ſo far out, except only near the ſhore, as about 3 or 4 Leagues diſtant; for farther than that, you will find only the right Coaſting Trade-Wind. This I have experienced in ſeveral Parts of the World, particularly at <hi>Jamaica;</hi> about which I have made many Voyages, both on the North and the South ſide, where I have experienced the Sea-Breezes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to differ; for on the South ſide I have found the true Sea-Wind after 12 a Clock, and in very fair Weather at S. or S. S. E. though it ſprung up in the Morning at E. S. E. or S. E. And on the North ſide I have found the Sea-Breeze at N. or N. N. E. though it roſe in the Morning at E. N. E. but whether there may be the like difference about ſmaller Iſlands, as at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, tho' I am apt to believe there is not. So much far the Sea-Winds, next of the Land-Breezes.</p>
                  <p>Land Breezes are as remarkable as any Winds that I have yet treated of; they are quite contrary to the Sea-Breezes; for thoſe blow right from the ſhore, but the Sea-Breez right in upon the ſhore; and as the Sea-Breezes do blow in the Day and reſt in the Night; ſo on the contrary, theſe do blow in the Night and reſt in the Day, and ſo they do alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0799400300:362"/>
ſucceed each other. For when the Sea-Breezes have performed their Offices of the Day, by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on their reſpective Coaſts, they in the Evening do either withdraw from the Coaſt, or lye down to reſt: Then the Land-VVinds, whoſe Office is to be breath in the Night, moved by the ſame order of Divine Impulſe, do rouze out of their private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and gently fan the Air till the next Morning; and then their taſk ends and they leave the Stage.</p>
                  <p>There can be no proper time ſet when they do begin in the Evening, or when they retire in the Morning, for they do not keep to an hour; but they commonly ſpring up between 6 and 12 in the Evening, and laſt till 6, 8, or 10 in the Morning. They both come and go away again earlier or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the VVeather, the Seaſon of the Year, or ſome accidental Cauſe from the Land: For on ſome Coaſts they do riſe earlier, blow fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher, and remain later than on other Coaſts, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>They are called Land-VVinds, becauſe they blow off ſhore contrary to the Sea-Breez, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Coaſt lies: Yet I would not ſo be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if theſe VVinds are only found to breathe near the ſhores of any Land, and not in the Inland Parts of ſuch Countries remote from the Sea; for in my Travels I have found them in the very heart of the Countries that I have paſſed through; as particularly on the Iſthmus of <hi>Darien,</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica:</hi> Both which places I have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled over from Sea to Sea; yet becauſe theſe are but ſmall Tracts of Land in compariſon with the two main Bodies of Land of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> and thoſe vaſt Regions in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> lying within the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, I cannot determine whether the Land-VVinds are there, as I have fonnd them in my ſmall Travels: therefore I ſhall only confine this particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

                     </gap> of <hi>Darien;</hi> there I have found the Land-Winds it the middle of the Country blowing all Night, and till 10 or 11 a Clock in the Morning, before I could perceive the Sea-Breeze to ariſe, and that not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable many times, but by the flying of the Clouds, eſpecially if I was in a Valley; and it was in Vallies that I did chiefly perceive the Land-Winds, which blew in ſome places one way, in others contrary, or ſide-ways to that according as the Vallies lay pend up between the Mountains; and that without any reſpect to either the North or the South Seas, but indeed near either ſide of the Land, they always bent their courſe towards the neareſt Sea, unleſs there was any Hill between them and the Sea, and then they took their Courſe along in the Vallies; but from both ſhores, as well from the North as the South they blow right forth into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>In the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica</hi> theſe Land-Winds are in the middle of the Country, alſo I have found them ſo, as I travelled from one ſide of the Iſland to the other, having lain 2 Nights by the way, as I had before obſerved them, when I liv'd at 16 Miles Walk, where I continued about 6 Months; but there and in other Iſlands the Land-Winds do blow towards the neareſt ſhores, and ſo from thence off to Sea, whether the ſhore's lye Eaſt, Weſt, North or South.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Winds blow off to Sea, a greater or leſs diſtance according as the Coaſt lies more or leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Sea-Winds: For in ſome Places we find them briſk 3 or 4 Leagues off ſhore; in other Places not ſo many Miles, and in ſome Places they ſcarce peep without the Rocks, or if they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in very fair Weather make a ſally out a Mile or 2, they are not laſting, but ſuddenly vaniſh away,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0799400300:364"/>
though yet there are every Night as freſh Land-Winds aſhore at thoſe Places as in any other part of the World.</p>
                  <p>Places moſt remarkable for the feweſt or fainteſt Land-Winds, are thoſe that lye moſt open to the Common Trade-Winds, as the Eaſt ends of any Iſlands where the Trade-Winds do blow in upon the Shore, or the Head-Lands on Iſlands or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents that are open to the Sea-breez, eſpecially where the Trade-Wind blows down ſide-ways, by the Coaſt; for there ſuch Head-Lands as ſtretch fartheſt out to Sea are moſt expoſed to Winds from the Sea; and have the leſs benefit of the Land-Breezes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give a few Inſtances of either. And firſt of all begin with the N. E. and S. E. Points of the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica:</hi> Theſe Points are at the Eaſt end of the Iſland, one is at the very Extreme of the North ſide towards the Eaſt, the other on the South Extreme towards the ſame Point; at theſe two Places we ſeldom light of a Land-Wind; nor very often at the End of the Iſland between them, except near the ſhore. For that Reaſon the <hi>Sloop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of <hi>Jamaica</hi> that Trade round the Iſland are commonly put to their Trumps, when they come there in their Voyages: For if they meet no Land-Wind they are obliged to beat about by turning to Wind-ward againſt the Sea-breez in the Day time; they then curſe theſe Points of Land, and are fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly apt to believe that ſome <hi>Daemon</hi> haunts there.</p>
                  <p>And if they are 2 or 3 days in beating about (as ſometimes they are) when they return to <hi>Port-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> they will talk as much of their Fatigues, as if they had been beating a Month to double the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> though indeed the Men are briſk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and manage their Sloops very well; which alſo are generally very good Boats to ſail on a Wind. I think they are the beſt ſmall Trading-Boats in the King's Dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0799400300:365"/>
Point <hi>Pedro</hi> on the <hi>South-ſide</hi> of the Iſland, is another very bad Point to double, if a <hi>Ship</hi> come from the Weſt-end of the Iſland; This Point runs out far into the <hi>Sea,</hi> and is not only deſtitute of the Common Land-VVinds. But if there is any Current ſetting to Leeward, here the <hi>Sloop-men</hi> meet it. Therefore they are many times longer beating about it, then about the two former Points of the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beſtowing ſome Curſes upon it. Nay ſome Captains of Privateers, when they have been beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, have ſtood cloſe into the Point, and fired their Guns to kill the old <hi>Daemon</hi> that they ſay inhabits there to diſturb poor <hi>Seamen.</hi> I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated theſe odd Paſſages to ſhew how ignorant Men are that cannot ſee the Reaſon of it. And becauſe I am not willing to leave my Reader in the dark, I ſhall give a few Inſtances more on this ſubject. The North ſide of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> at the entrance into the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> gives us another Inſtance of bad Land-VVinds; and commonly where the Land-VVinds are ſcanty, the Sea-Breezes are but indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent neither. This will partly appear by what I have obſerved of them on this Coaſt between <hi>Cape Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach;</hi> and <hi>Cape Condecedo</hi> at the entrance of the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> which two places are about Eighty Leagues diſtant; for there the Land trends Eaſt and Weſt. It is a ſtreight Coaſt and lies all of it equally expoſed to the Trade-VVind, which is commonly there at E. N. E. To the VV. of theſe Places the Sea and Land-VVinds do as duly ſucceed each other, as on any other Coaſt, but here they are each of them of a Baſtard kind; for the Sea-Breezes are at N. E. by E. which is no better than a Coaſt Trade-VVind, and the Land-VVind is at E. S. E. or S. E. by E. whereas if the Winds were as true there as on other Coaſts, the Sea-Breez would be at N. N. E
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0799400300:366"/>
ſometimes at N. and the Land-Winds would be at S. S. E. and S. as they are indeed cloſe under the ſhore; which if they do at any time come off from, they are very faint. The Land on this Coaſt is low and even, and the Land-Winds aſhore are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty briſk.</p>
                  <p>The Capes on the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Coaſt in the <hi>South Seas,</hi> will more fully make it appear, that Head-Lands do ſeldom afford any Land-Winds. I ſhall only Inſtance in <hi>Cape Paſſao,</hi> in Lat. 8 Minutes <hi>South, Cape St. Laurence,</hi> in Lat. 1 d.—<hi>South,</hi> and <hi>Cape Blanco,</hi> in 3 d.—<hi>South.</hi> I have paſs'd by them all ſeveral times and at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Seaſons; yet did never find any Land-winds there, though between theſe Places there are very good Land-winds. Therefore <hi>Ships</hi> that ſail to the <hi>Southward</hi> againſt the Breeze, muſt beat it about by hard Labour, eſpecially about <hi>Cape Blanco,</hi> for that lyes more expoſed than the other 2: and if there is any Current, as commonly, the Spaniards are a long time getting about, ſometimes a Fortnight or 3 Weeks; and when they have ſplit their <hi>Sails,</hi> which are ſeldom very good, they run back to <hi>Guiaquill</hi> to mend them again. We found it hard getting about, tho' our <hi>Sails</hi> were good; and I think we could work our <hi>Ships</hi> better than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ever able to do in thoſe <hi>Seas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already given ſeveral Inſtances of ſuch Places, as have no Land-winds, or at leaſt but very ordinary ones; I ſhall next proceed in order to ſhew where the ſtrongeſt or beſt Land-Winds are met with; and then I ſhall ſpeak of thoſe Places where there blows a moderate and indifferent Gale between both Extreams: That ſo any one may judge by the Lying of the Land, whether it may afford a good Land-wind or know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0799400300:367"/>
The briſkeſt Land-winds are commonly in deep Bays, in great Lakes within Land, and among great Ranges of Iſlands or ſmall Keys that lye near the ſhore: I ſhall give Inſtances of all theſe. And as for Bays, I ſhall firſt pitch on the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> which lies between <hi>Cape Condecedo</hi> and the High-Land of <hi>St. Martin;</hi> between both theſe Places the Land-winds are as briſk 2 or 3 Leagues off at <hi>Sea,</hi> as in any Place that I know. In the Cod or Middle of the Bay, the Land trends from Eaſt to Weſt, there the <hi>Sea-Breezes</hi> are at North, and the Land-winds at South; they commonly begin to blow at 7 or 8 a Clock in the Evening, and continue till 8 or 9 the next Morning, in the dry <hi>Seaſon</hi> eſpecially. In that Bay there is an Iſland, call'd by the <hi>Engliſh Beef-Iſland</hi> from the multitude of Bulls and Cows that inhabit it. The ſmell of theſe wild Cattle is driven off to <hi>Sea,</hi> by the Land-winds ſo freſh, that by it Maſters of <hi>Ships</hi> ſailing in the Night on this Coaſt have known where they were, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anchored that Night, and come into the Iſland of <hi>Triſt</hi> the next Day; whereas they would otherwiſe have paſt farther to the Weſtward quite out of their way, if they had not ſmell'd the ſtrong ſcent of theſe Cattle.</p>
                  <p>So all the bottom of the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> even from the High-Land of <hi>St. Martin</hi> down to <hi>Lavera Cruz,</hi> and from thence Northerly towards the River <hi>Meſchaſipi</hi> affords good Land-winds and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breezes. The Bay of <hi>Honduras</hi> alſo, and almoſt all the Coaſt between it and <hi>Cape La Vela,</hi> affords the like, allowing for the Capes and Points of Land, which lye between; where it fails more or leſs, as the <hi>Points</hi> do lye more or leſs expoſed to the Sea-Breezes.</p>
                  <p>So in the <hi>South Seas,</hi> the Bays of <hi>Panama, Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>quil, Paita,</hi> &amp;c. have their freſh Land-winds and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breezes. But in ſome Places, as particularly at <hi>Paita,</hi> the Land-winds do not ſpring up till 12 a Clock in

the Night, but then are always very freſh, and laſt till 7 or 8 the next Morning; and they are conſtant all the Year long: Whereas in the Bay of <hi>Panama,</hi> and alſo in all the Bays and Coaſts of the other, or North ſide of <hi>America</hi> already deſcribed, they are not ſo conſtant in the wet <hi>Seaſon</hi> as they are in the dry.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi> will alſo afford us Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Land-winds that blow in <hi>Logunes:</hi> As for Inſtance, the <hi>Lagune</hi> of <hi>Triſt,</hi> which is about 9 or 10 Leagues long and 3 broad, is barricadoed from the Sea by the Iſland of <hi>Triſt.</hi> There the Land-winds blow in the dry <hi>Seaſon</hi> from 5 or 6 a Clock in the Evening, till 9 or 10 in the Morning. There are two other <hi>Lagunes</hi> lying within that, and parted from it by low <hi>Mangrove-Land:</hi> there the Land-winds are freſher and the Sea-Breeze duller, and of a leſs continuance, than in the <hi>Lagune</hi> of <hi>Triſt.</hi> Nay, ſometimes the Land-wind blows all Day; ſo in the <hi>Lagune</hi> of <hi>Maracabo</hi> to Wind-ward of <hi>Cape Alta Vola,</hi> the Land-winds are very freſh and laſting. The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Lagune</hi> of <hi>Venizuella</hi> or <hi>Comana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes in the fore-mentioned <hi>Lagunes,</hi> the Land-winds do blow for 3 or 4 Days and Nights together, ſcarce ſuffering the Sea-Breez to breath there; though at the ſame time the Sea-Breez may blow freſh out at Sea: and if the Sea-Breez at ſuch times ſhould make a bold <hi>Sally</hi> into theſe <hi>Lagunes,</hi> it would be but of a ſhort continuance. On the other Hand at Capes and Head-Lands more expoſed to Sea-Breezes, the Land-winds are ſhier of coming there, than the Sea-winds are into <hi>Lagunes.</hi> Neither may we forget the Harbour of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> for there are very good Land-winds. It is compaſſed in on one ſide with a long Neck of Sand, and many ſmall Iſlands at the mouth of it, and within there is a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0799400300:369"/>
pretty deep Lake, in which are conſtant Sea and Land-winds, by which the Wherry-men run with full ſail, both to <hi>Legamy</hi> or <hi>Paſſage Fort,</hi> from the Town and back again. They go away with the Sea-Breeze, and return with the Land-wind. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paſſengers that have occaſion to go either way, wait for the coming of theſe Winds, except their Buſineſs requires haſt: for then they are rowed againſt the Breez; and tho' the Land-winds do ſometimes fail or come very late, yet the Wherries ſeldom ſtay beyond their conſtant Hours of 7 or 8 a Clock, and ſometimes the Land-winds do come by 3 or 4, but when they come ſo early it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly after a Tornado from the Land. This may ſuffice as to the Land-winds in Lakes or Bays.</p>
                  <p>As to what may be ſpoken concerning the Land-winds among Iſlands, I ſhall only mention 2 Places, both of them in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> the firſt are the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Cuba,</hi> which are abundance of ſmall Iſlands bordering on the <hi>South ſide</hi> of <hi>Cuba,</hi> reaching in length from Eaſt to Weſt, or near thoſe Points as the Iſland lies, about 70 Leagues; and in ſome Places reaching near 20 Leagues from the ſaid Iſland. Among theſe Iſlands, even from the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of them, quite home to <hi>Cuba,</hi> there are very briſk Land-winds. They ſpring up early in the Evening, and blow late in the Morning. The <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> Turtlers viſit theſe <hi>Keys</hi> with good ſucceſs for Turtle all the Year long, and from thence bring moſt of their Turtle wherewith the Market of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> is ſerved. The other Iſlands I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the <hi>Sambaloe</hi> Iſlands betwixt <hi>Cape Samblaſs</hi> and <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> tho' they are not ſo large a Range as the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Cuba,</hi> yet do they afford very good Land-winds; near as good as the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Cuba</hi> do. And thus much for the Places where the beſt as well as where the ſcantieſt or fainteſt Land-winds are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0799400300:370"/>
found. I ſhall next give ſome Inſtances of the Medium between both Extreams.</p>
                  <p>I have already ſhewn that Capes and ſuch Head-Lands as lye out fartheſt from the reſt of the ſhore, are thereby moſt expoſed to the Sea-winds, and conſequently the Land-winds are there much fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in other Places, eſpecially in deep Bays or Lagunes within Land, or among Iſlands and ſmall Keys near the Land; All which is no more than my own experience has taught me. I ſhall now ſhew how the Land-winds blow on Coaſts that do lye more level. As all Coaſts have their Points and bendings, ſo accordingly the Land-winds are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher or fainter, as you come either towards theſe bendings or towards intermitting Points or Head-Lands.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give an Inſtance of this by ſhewing how the Winds are on the Coaſt of <hi>Coraccos.</hi> It is as ſtreight a <hi>Shore</hi> as I can pitch on, yet full of ſmall Bays, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from each other by a like number of Ridges of High-Land, that ſhoot forth their Heads a little way without the Bays on each ſide. There in the Night or Morning, while the Land-wind blows, we find freſh Gales out of the Bays: but when we come abreaſt of the Head-Lands, we find it Calm; yet ſee the Breeze curling on the Water on both ſides of us, and ſometimes get a ſpurt of it to help us forward: and having recovered the Wind out of the next Bay, we paſs by the Mouth of it preſently, till we come to the next Head; and there we lye becalmed as before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Bays are not above half a Mile or a Mile wide; neither are the Heads much wider; but theſe Heads of the Ridges lying in between the Bays, have ſteep Cliffs againſt the Sea; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have met the like ſteep Cliffs againſt the Sea, I have ſeldom found any Land-Winds. But in all other Places where the Bays ſtrike deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land, there we find the Land-winds more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0799400300:371"/>
laſting and ſtrong; and where the Points are farther out, there are ſtill the leſs Land-winds, and the briſker Sea-Breezes. For the Capes and ſmaller Points on all ſhores ſeem to be ſo many Barricadoes to break off the violence of the Sea-Breezes; for this we always find when we are turning to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being to Leeward of a Cape, that the Breez is moderate, eſpecially if we keep very near the ſhore; but when once we come within a Mile, more or leſs of the Cape and ſtand off to Sea, as ſoon as we get without it, we find ſuch a huſſing Breez, that ſometimes we are not able to ply againſt it, but in the Night we find a freſh Land-wind to Leeward; tho' when we come to the Cape we find it Calm; or perhaps ſometimes meet with a Sea-wind. The Land-Breezes on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> between <hi>Cape St. Anns</hi> and <hi>Cape Palmas,</hi> (mentioned in the ſecond Chapter of this Diſcourſe,) are at E. blowing briſk 4 Leagues off ſhore: the Sea-winds there are at S. W. The Land-winds on the Coaſt of <hi>Angola</hi> are at E. N. E. the Sea-winds at W. S. W. theſe are very true Winds of both kinds.</p>
                  <p>The Land-winds on the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico</hi> in the <hi>South Seas,</hi> are in moſt Places right off from the ſhore, elſe the Fiſher-men could never go out to Sea, as they do, on Bark-Loggs. And as the Land-winds are true there, ſo are the Sea-Breezes alſo; for with the Land-wind they go out to Fiſh, and return in again with the Sea-winds. In ſome Places they uſe Seals-Skins inſtead of Bark-Loggs; they are made ſo tight that no Bladder is tighter. To theſe they have long Necks like the Neck of a Bladder, into which they put a Pipe and blow them up, as we do Bladders; two of theſe being faſtned together, a Man ſets a-ſtride them, having one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and the other behind him; and ſo ſits firmer than in a Troopers Saddle. His Paddle is like a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0799400300:372"/>
Quarter-ſtaff, with a broad Blade at each end; with this he ſtrikes the <hi>Sea</hi> back, firſt on one ſide, and then on the other, with each end of his Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and ſo gives himſelf freſh way through the Water.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> alſo there are true Sea-Breezes, as well on the Iſlands, as on the Main. On Iſlands, as at <hi>Bantam</hi> in the Iſland <hi>Java,</hi> and at <hi>Achin</hi> in the Iſland <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and in many Places on the Iſland <hi>Mindanao:</hi> And on the Main alſo, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly at <hi>Fort St George</hi> on the Coaſt <hi>Coromandel.</hi> There the Land-winds blow right off from the ſhore, and the Sea-winds right in; but ſometimes they come ſlanting in; and about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> they blow from the N. E. or N. N. E. I found them ſo when I came on the Coaſt, and being adviſed of it by Mr. <hi>Coventry,</hi> in whoſe Sloop I then was, I fell in with the Land 10 or 12 Leagues to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Fort, and had a briſk Northerly Sea-wind to bring me into the Road.</p>
                  <p>I think theſe Inſtances are enough to ſhew how theſe Land-winds do uſually blow in moſt parts of the World; ſhould I be very particular, 'tis not a larger Treatiſe then I intend this to be, would hold a quarter-part of it. But I have been more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>South Seas,</hi> becauſe theſe Land-winds are of more uſe there than in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> For though ſometimes Men in the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> do turn againſt the <hi>Monſoons,</hi> yet they do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally tarry for them before they budge.</p>
                  <p>Indeed theſe Winds are an extraordinary bleſſing to thoſe that uſe the Sea in any part of the World, within the Tropicks; for as the conſtant Trade-winds do blow, there could be no ſailing in theſe Seas: But by the help of the Sea and Land-Breezes, Ships will ſail 2 or 3 hundred Leagues; as particularly from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> to the <hi>Lagune</hi> of <hi>Triſt,</hi> in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0799400300:373"/>
the Bay of <hi>Campeachy;</hi> and then back again, all againſt the Trade-wind; And I think this is one of the longeſt Voyages that is uſed of this kind. If any of our <hi>Jamaica Sloops</hi> do go to <hi>Triſt,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to carry their Wood to <hi>Curaſao,</hi> then they put through the Gulph of <hi>Florida.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo that come from any part of the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and are bound to any Place to Windward of the Iſland <hi>Cuba,</hi> are wont to put through the Gulph, and ſo ſtretch away to the Northward, till they come clear of the Trade, and then ſtand away as far as they pleaſe to the Eaſtward; This is alſo the uſual way from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> though ſometimes they turn up by the <hi>Carribbee</hi> Iſlands, only taking the Benefit of theſe Sea and Land-winds. So alſo <hi>Ships</hi> may and do paſs from <hi>Portobello</hi> to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> or to <hi>St. Martha,</hi> or to any other Place, by the help of theſe Breezes, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is not too far. So by taking the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theſe Winds, Sloops in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> ſail clear round the Iſlands, or to any part of them, in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>In the South Seas alſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages from <hi>Panama</hi> to <hi>Lima,</hi> by taking the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theſe Winds, do ſail as high as <hi>Cape Blan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o;</hi> but in all their Voyages to the Southward of that Cape, they ſtand quite off to Sea into the Trade. Thus you ſee the uſe and advantage of them.</p>
                  <p>The Seamen that ſail in <hi>Sloops</hi> or other ſmall Veſſels in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> do know very well when they ſhall meet a briſk Land-Wind, by the Foggs that hang over the Land before Night; for it is a certain ſign of of a good Land-Wind, to ſee a thick Fogg lye ſtill and quiet, like Smoak over the Land, not ſtirring any way; and we look out for ſuch Signs when we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0799400300:374"/>
are plying to Windward. For if we ſee no Fog over the Land, the Land-wind will be but faint and ſhort that Night. Theſe ſigns are to be obſerved chiefly in fair Weather: for in the wet <hi>Seaſon</hi> Foggs do hang over the Land all the Day, and it may be neither Land-wind nor Sea-Breeze ſtirring. If in the Afternoon alſo in fair Weather, we ſee a Tornado over the Land, it commonly ſends us forth a freſh Land-Wind.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Land-winds are very cold, and though the Sea-Breezes are always much ſtronger, yet theſe are colder by far. The Sea-Breezes indeed are very comfortable and refreſhing; for the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time in all the Day is about 9, 10 or 11 a Clock in the Morning, in the interval between both Breezes: For then it is commonly Calm, and then People pant for breath, eſpecially if it is late before the Sea-Breez comes, but afterwards the Breez allays the heat. However, in the Evening again after the Sea-Breez is ſpent, it is very hot till the Land-wind ſprings up, which is ſometimes not till 12 a Clock or after.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon Men when they go to Bed uncloath themſelves and lye without any thing over them: Nay, the ordinary ſort of People ſpread mats at their Doors, or elſe in their Yards, in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and lye down to ſleep in the open Air.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> at <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> alſo Men take their Cotts or little Field-Beds, and put them into the Yards, and go to ſleep in the Air: And Seamen aboard Ships in theſe hot Countries lye on the Deck, till the Land-wind comes.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Jamaica</hi> or <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> have ſomewhat to cover themſelves when the Land-wind comes, beſide a Pillow on their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0799400300:375"/>
Breaſt, or between their Arms. But Seamen who have wrought hard all Day, lye naked and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Air, it may be all Night long, before they awake, without any covering, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they have had their doſe of Punch. But next Morning they are ſcarce able to budge, being ſtiff with cold, that brings them to Fluxes, and that to their Graves; and this is the fate of many ſtout and brave Seamen: and it is a great pity that Maſters of Ships have ſo little regard for their Men, as not by ſome good Orders, to prohibit this dangerous Cuſtom of lying abroad and naked in the Nights.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Shall begin with the <hi>Summaſenta-Winds,</hi> as they are called, which blow in the Bay of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy.</hi> Theſe are Winds that come in the Months of <hi>Feb. March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and they blow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Bay between the High-Land of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Cape Condecedo;</hi> which Places are about 120 Leagues aſunder. They are, properly ſpeaking, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sea-Breezes nor true Land-winds, yet in reſpect of their blowing in ſome meaſure from the ſhore, they are in that ſomewhat of kin to the Land-winds. Theſe Winds are commonly at E. S. E. in the Cod or Middle of the Bay where the Land lies E. and W. and the true Land-winds there are at S. S. E. but from thence towards <hi>Cape Condecedo,</hi> the Land trends away N. E. and N. N. E. and N. So that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Land-winds there reſpecting the Land from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0799400300:377"/>
whence they blow; but then they differ both from Sea and Land-Breezes in reſpect to their duration: For theſe <hi>Summaſenta-Winds</hi> blow 3 or 4 Days, ſometimes a Week, both Night and Day before they ceaſe. They are commonly dry Winds and blow very freſh, and Ships that go from <hi>Triſt</hi> with Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood at the time when theſe Winds blow, will be at <hi>Cape Condecedo</hi> in 3 or 4 Days; whereas if they go at any other time, it will take up 8 or 10 Days, tho' ſeldom more than that: For here are good Land-winds and Sea-Breezes at other times.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Winds are commonly colder than the Sea-winds, though not ſo cold as the Land-winds, yet ſtronger than either. I never could perceive that theſe Winds did make any alteration on our Bodies different from other Winds. But the Tides when theſe Winds blow on that Coaſt, are very ſmall, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the <hi>Lagunes</hi> of <hi>Triſt;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>thagena</hi> there are a peculiar ſort of Winds that blow in the Months of <hi>April, May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> ſo very fierce, that Ships are not able to ply to Windward on that Coaſt while theſe Winds laſt. Theſe Winds blow about 40 or 50 <hi>Leagues</hi> to <hi>Windward</hi> of <hi>Carthagena</hi> Town, and about 10 to Leeward of it. They are very fierce from the middle of the Channel between it and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola,</hi> and ſo continue almoſt to the Coaſt of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena.</hi> Tho' they are ſometimes a little fainter within 2 or 3 <hi>Leagues</hi> of the ſhore, eſpecially Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Evenings. They commonly riſe in the Morning before day, ſometimes at 3 or 4 a Clock, and ſo continue till 9, 10 or 11 at Night, and thus they will blow 10 or 11 Days together very fiercely. At this time the Land-winds beſides their ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance are very faint and blow but a little way off ſhore: So that from 10 or 11 at Night till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0799400300:378"/>
Morning 'tis quite Calm and not one breath of Wind from a <hi>League</hi> diſtant off the ſhore; tho' 3 or 4 further off you'll find the Breez, and nearer a ſmall <hi>Land-Wind.</hi> Theſe Winds are at E. N. E. as the Common Trade is; whereas the Sea-Breezes are at N. E. by N. or N. N. E.</p>
                  <p>While theſe fierce Winds ſtay, the Sky is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly clear without any Cloud to be ſeen; tho' doubtleſs 'tis imperceptibly hazy, for then the Sun does not give a true black ſhade on the Ground, but very faint and duſky. The Horizon too looks very duſky, thick and hazy, and while the Sun is near the Horizon, either in the Morning or Evening, it looks very red. Sometimes, tho' but ſeldom, when theſe Winds blow the Sky is over-caſt with ſmall Clouds, which afford ſome drizling ſmall Rain. But tho' theſe Winds are ſo fierce on the Coaſt of <hi>Carthage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> yet both to Windward and to Leeward at the diſtances before-mentioned, the Breezes blow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as at other times. For the Sea and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds do there keep their conſtant and regular Courſes. Neither are the Coaſts of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> or <hi>Jamaica</hi> troubled with theſe fierce Winds, any nearer than half Channel over as was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>It has not been my fortune to have been on this Coaſt when theſe Winds have blown, yet I have had the Relation of it ſo often, and from ſo many Perſons that I am very well ſatisfi'd of the truth of it: Nay, it is ſo generally known among the <hi>Jamaica</hi> Seamen and Privateers that they call a <hi>Talkative Perſon</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, a <hi>Carthagene-Breeze.</hi> I remember 2 or 3 Men that went by that Name, and I knew them by no other, tho' I was in the ſame Ship with them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months.</p>
                  <p>Some of our Engliſh Frigots that have been ſent to <hi>Jamaica</hi> have experienced theſe Breezes when the Governour has ſent them upon buſineſs to that Coaſt: For plying between <hi>Portobello</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> when they have been within 10 Leagues of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0799400300:379"/>
have met with the Sea Breez ſo ſtrong that they have been forced to riff their Topſail, which even then they could not maintain, but have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to furle it quite up; and ſo with only their lower Sails, which ſometimes they have been forced to riff too, have been beating 8 or 10 Days, to get only ſo many Leagues; which tho' at laſt they have done, yet has it been with much trouble, and not without damage to their Sails and Rigging. Neither can I forget a <hi>Squadron</hi> of French Frigots, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Count <hi>de Eſtrees,</hi> that came to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and demanded leave of the Governour to Wood and Water there; which becauſe it ſeemed ſtrange that they ſhould want in coming only from <hi>Petit Guavas;</hi> it was demanded of them why they came from thence ſo ill provided? They ſaid they went from <hi>Petit Guavas</hi> over to the Coaſt of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> with a deſign to have plyed to Wind-ward under that ſhore, but met the Breezes ſo hard on the Coaſt, that they were not able to hold up their ſides againſt it, and for that Reaſon ſtood back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Petit Guavas;</hi> but not being able to fetch it, therefore they came to Wood and Water at <hi>Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> deſigning to go from thence thro' the Gulph: And tho' the Pilots of <hi>Jamaica</hi> did all conclude that the Breeze-time was paſt by more than a Month, yet the Governour gave them leave to Wood and Water at <hi>Blew-fields Bay,</hi> and ſent one Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> to be their Pilot thither.

                  <p>In the <hi>South Seas</hi> on the <hi>Mexican</hi> Coaſt, between <hi>Cape Blanco</hi> in the <hi>Lat.</hi> of 9 D. 56 M.

They are very briſk Winds, but not violent: I have been in one of them when w

went from <hi>Caldera</hi> Bay, bound to <hi>Realeja</hi> mentioned in my Voyage round the World, Chap. 5. Pag. 118. which blew at <hi>North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> there are Winds call'd by the <hi>Portugueſe Terrenos,</hi> becauſe they blow from the <hi>Land.</hi> Theſe are not thoſe <hi>Land-Winds</hi> that I have already treated of; for theſe blow only in <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Aug.</hi> and are in ſeveral reſpects quite contrary to them. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true <hi>Land-Winds</hi> blow only in the Night, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Evenings and Mornings; on the contrary, theſe blow 3 or 4 Days without intermiſſion; nay ſometimes a Week or 10 Days together: and as the true Nocturnal <hi>Land-Winds</hi> are very cold, on the contrary theſe are the hotteſt of all Winds I ever heard of: They come with hot Blooms, ſuch as I have mentioned in my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> Chap. 20. Pag. 530. Theſe <hi>Winds</hi> are at <hi>Weſt,</hi> and they blow only in the Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which is the <hi>Weſt Monſoon-Seaſon,</hi> tho' the proper <hi>Monſoon</hi> then on this Coaſt is S. W. When theſe hot Winds come, the better ſort of People at <hi>Fort St. George</hi> keep cloſe: They alſo ſhut up their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Doors to keep them out; and I have heard Gentlemen that lived there ſay, that when they have been thus ſhut up within Doors, they have been ſenſible when the Wind ſhifted by the Change they have felt in their Bodies. And notwithſtanding that theſe Winds are ſo hot, yet the Inhabitants don't ſweat while they laſt, for their Skins are hard and rough, as if they had been parched by the Fire, eſpecially their Faces and Hands, yet does it not make them ſick. The Sands which are raiſed by theſe Winds are a great annoyance to thoſe whoſe buſineſs lyes abroad, and who can't keep their Houſes. For many times they wheel about and raiſe the <hi>Sands</hi> ſo thick, that it flies like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that lye in the road at that time have their Decks covered with this <hi>Sand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi> they have of theſe ſons of Winds alſo, but not at the ſame time of the Year. For as theſe on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel</hi> blow in the Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the <hi>Weſt Monſoon</hi> Reigns; on the contrary on the <hi>Malabar</hi> Coaſt they blow in the Months of <hi>December, January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> when the Eaſt or North Eaſt <hi>Monſoon</hi> blows: for then the Eaſterly Wind, which is then the true <hi>Monſoon,</hi> comes from over the <hi>Land</hi> of this Coaſt; This being the <hi>Weſt-ſide,</hi> as the Coaſt of <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel</hi> is the <hi>Eaſt-ſide</hi> of this long <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Promontory.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Perſon</hi> Gulph is as remarkable for theſe hot Winds as either of the former; they come there in the Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Monſoon</hi> time; and the heat there by all Accounts does by far exceed that on the other two Coaſts.</p>
                  <p>The European Merchants that are imployed in the Ports within the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do leave their Coaſt, Habitations and Buſineſs there, during theſe hot Months, and ſpend their time at <hi>Iſpahan</hi> till the Air is more agreeable to their Bodies; but their <hi>Servants</hi> muſt indure it. And if any <hi>Ships</hi> are there, then the <hi>Seamen</hi> alſo muſt do as well as they can. 'Tis reported the Commanders do keep Bathing-Troughs full of Water to lye and wallow in, and hide their Bodies from the noiſom hot Blooms. I was never in any of theſe hot <hi>Winds,</hi> for I went from <hi>Fort St. George</hi> before they came on the Coaſt.</p>

On the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> there are a particular ſort of Land-winds, which are very remarkable; not for their Heat, as thoſe laſt-mentioned, but for their exceeding Cold and Searching Nature. They are called <hi>Harmatans.</hi> I have had an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them from ſeveral who have Traded to <hi>Guinea;</hi> but more eſpecially from a very Senſible and Experienced Gentleman, Mr <hi>Greenhill,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of His Majeſties Navy at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> who upon my Requeſt, was pleaſed to ſend me the following Account: which the Reader cannot have better than in his own Words.

The uſual Time of their blowing is between the latter part of <hi>December,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>February;</hi> before and beyond which Seaſons, they never exceed. They are of ſo very cold, ſharp and piercing a Nature, that the Seams of the Floors of our Chambers and the Sides and Decks of our Ships (as for as they are above Water) will open ſo wide, as that with facility you may put a Caulking Iron a conſiderable way into them; in which condition they continue ſo long as the <hi>Harma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> blows, (which is ſometimes two or three, and very rarely five Days, which is the very utmoſt I ever obſerved or heard of) and when they are gone, they cloſe again and are as tight as if it never had been.

                        <p>This I accidentally experimented by expoſing a couple of Goats to the Aſperity thereof; which in four hours ſpace or thereabouts; were depriv'd of Life. Nay we our ſelves (unleſs aſſiſted by the like Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and the benefit of ſome ſweet Oyls to correct the Air) cannot fetch our Breath ſo-freely as at other times; but are almoſt ſuffocated with too frequent and Acid Reſpirations. They generally blow between the E. and E. N. E. to the Northward of which they never exceed, being the moſt ſettled and ſteddy (but freſh) Gale, I ever obſerv'd; coming without Thunder, Lightning or Rain; but cloſe gloomy Weather; the Sun not ſhining all the time: And when they expire, the Trade-wind (which conſtantly blows on that Coaſt at W.

                           </gap> Night, till near that time the next Morning: During which interval, we are troubled with ſlinking Fogs and Miſts off Shore, which by return of the Sea Breezes upon the oppoſite Points are all driven away;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0799400300:384"/>
and we have the benefit of them, in a curious freſh Gale, till about 5 in the Afternoon.</p>
                        <p>And here let me Note it for a general Obſervation, That in theſe and all eother Places within the Tropicks (as far as ever I took notice) the Wind is drawn by the Land. For if an Iſland or Head-Land, were inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a circular Form, the Sea and Land-Breezes fall in Diametrically oppoſite to that part where you are. So that if you are on the South ſide, the Sea-Breez ſhall be at South, and the Land-Breez (when it comes in its Seaſon) at North.</p>
                        <p>In getting on the Coaſt, we indeavour to fall in with <hi>Cape Mount</hi> or <hi>Cape Miſerada,</hi> which is about 18 Leagues to the E. S. Eaſtward thereof; and after that we double <hi>Cape Palmas</hi> (whence as aforeſaid, the Land trends away E. by N.) the Current near the ſhore ſets upon that Point down into the <hi>Bite.</hi> But in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, we as much attempt (if poſſible) to lay hold of <hi>St. Thomas;</hi> and thence to run to the Southward of the <hi>Line,</hi> perhaps 3 or 4 Degrees; for the further Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly we go, the ſtronger we find the Gales, and more beneficial for getting off the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt; but thoſe who keep to the Northward thereof, generally meet with more Calms; and conſequently longer Voyages enſue. In or about thoſe Latitudes we continue, till we are got between 25 and 30 Degrees to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Cape Lopez de Gonſalvo,</hi> and then we croſs again to go either for <hi>England</hi> or the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> But by the way let me obſerve to you, that when once we are to the Weſtward of the ſaid <hi>Cape,</hi> and in South Latitude, the <hi>Current</hi> ſets Northerly, and the Wind to 20 Degrees of Latitude, is at E. S. E. as (to the like number of Degrees) on the North ſide of the Line it blows at E. N. E. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever obſerve any Mutation of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unleſs in the Tornado-Seaſon, when during their blowing, they commonly ſet to Wind-ward; tho' perhaps the Moon upon Full and Change, may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0799400300:385"/>
have the like influence there, as in other Places; but I never took any particular notice thereof.</p>
                        <p>The ſaid <hi>Tornadoes</hi> uſually come in the beginning of <hi>Apr.</hi> and ſeldom relinquiſh the <hi>Gold Coaſt</hi> till <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> commences, and with frequent viſits make us ſenſible of their Qualities. We have ſometimes three or four in a day; but then their continuance is but ſhort; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not above two hours, and the ſtrength or fury (it may be) about a quarter or half an Hour; but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with prodigious Thunder, Lightning and Rain; and the violence of the Wind ſo extraordinary, as that it has ſometimes roled up the Lead wherewith the Houſes are cover'd, as cloſe and compactly, as poſſible it could be done by the Art of Man. The Name implies a variety of Winds: But the ſtrength of them is generally at <hi>S. E.</hi> and by Ships that are bound off the Coaſt, they are made uſe of to get to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall conclude with that moſt worthy Obſervation of the Seaſon wherein the Rains begin; which on the <hi>Gold Coaſt</hi> is about the 10th of <hi>April</hi> and this may be generally remarked, from 15 d. N. to 15 d. South La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that they follow the Sun within 5 or 6 d. And ſo proceed with him till be has touched the <hi>Tropick,</hi> and returns to the like Station again. This I ſhall illuſtrate by the following Example, <hi>Viz. Cape Corſo</hi> Caſtle lies in 4 d. 55 North. About the 10th of <hi>April</hi> the Sun has near 12 degrees N. Declination. At that time the Rains begin, and continue with the Inhabitants of that Place, until he has performed his Courſe to the greateſt obliquity from off the Equator, and returned to the like Poſition South. The ſame I ſuppoſe may be obſerved, and underſtood of other places within the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks.</hi>

                           <p>I have made ſome Remarks on it, as having found the like of what be aſſerts, in other places.

                           <p>I ſhall give you the trouble of a ſmall Relation of a Paſſage to <hi>Loango</hi> in the Year 1693. When we came ſo far to the <hi>Southward</hi> as 2 d. 40 m. N. Lat. and 8 d. 25 m. Longi. <hi>Weſtward</hi> from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lundi,</hi> it being 31 ſt of <hi>March</hi> we had ſmall Wind at S. S. W. and S. W. with ſhowers of Rain. There we met with prodigious ſhoals of Fiſh, conſiſting chiefly of <hi>Albicores</hi> and <hi>Bonetoes.</hi> There were alſo great numbers of Sharks; ſome 10 or 12 foot long. For diverſion we catch'd above an 100 of them at times. The other Fiſh we took as we had occaſion, freſh and freſh: and one day we caught a Barrel of them with empty Hooks. Theſe ſhoals of Fiſh kept us Company till we were under the Equator in Long 4 d. 3 m. Eaſtward of the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lundy.</hi> This was <hi>April</hi> 27. we had the Winds at S. E. and S. E. by E. freſh Gales and clear Weather; but a mighty Leeward Current. At the Fiſhes parting with us that day, I caught an <hi>Albicore</hi> that weighed 75<hi>l.</hi> It is a mighty ſtrong Fiſh, ſo that the Fiſhing-Craft muſt be very ſtrong to take them.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Loango</hi> I find to lye in Lat. 4d. 30m. S. and Longi. 18d. 8m. Eaſtward from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lundy:</hi> from whence I took my departure, bound for <hi>Jamaica, Oct.</hi> 7. 1693.</p>

ſtand off to the Weſtward with Larboard Tacks on Board, till we get 14 d. Long. to the Weſtward of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ango.</hi> And there we find the Winds veerable from S. S. E. to S. E. freſh Gales. When we get 34 d. to the Weſtward of <hi>Loango,</hi> we are then 16d. Weſtward from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lundy:</hi> and there we find the Winds veerable from S. E. by E. to E. by S. and Eaſt; and ſo they continue blowing freſh as we will ſtill run to the Weſtward between the Lat. of 3 and 4 d. South, till we make the Iſland <hi>Fernando de Noronho,</hi> which I find to lye in Lat. 3 d. 54m. 30ſ. South. And by the Experience of two Voyages have found its Longi. 40 d. 59 m. Weſtward from <hi>Loango,</hi> and 22 d. 51 m. from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lundy.</hi> This Iſland appears with a very high Pyramid. And when we come cloſe to it, the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid looks like a large Cathedral. On the N. W. ſide is a ſmall Bay to anchor in. But Ships muſt come pretty near the ſhore, becauſe it is deep Water. Here is plenty of Fiſh. And on the Iſland is ſome freſh Water, and low ſhrubs of Trees. We could ſee no living Creature on it but Dogs. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inhabited by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> having then War with them, took it, and carried the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> all away. The Body of the Iſland I judge to be about 4 Miles long, lying N. E. and S. W. near on the North ſide are ſome Rocks, pretty high above Water; and many Birds, as <hi>Sea Gulls</hi> and <hi>Man-of-War-Birds</hi> (which are ſomething like our <hi>Kites</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) I find the Current ſets ſtrong to the N. W. The variation very little. From thence I ſteered N. VV. with freſh Gales S. E. and at E. S. E. in order to croſs the Equator, and deſigning to make the Iſland <hi>Tobago:</hi> which by my Run from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Iſland, I find to lye in Lat. 11 d. 33 m. North Longi. VVeſtward of <hi>Fernando,</hi> 28 d. 19 m. The <hi>Meridian</hi> diſtance from <hi>Fernando</hi> 1721 Miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by my reckoning or Journal <hi>Tobago</hi> is VVeſt from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of the Iſle of <hi>Lundy</hi> 51 d. 10 m.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0799400300:390"/>
In this Paſſage between the ſaid Iſlands we find ſtrange Ripling and Cockling Seas, ready to leap in upon the Ships Deck; which makes us think the Current to be ſtrong: And it ſeems to be occaſioned by the great River on the main Land; which is not far from us in this Paſſage. <hi>Tobago</hi> is an high Iſland with a brave ſandy Bay on the S. W. ſide, where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had formerly a great Fort, till moleſted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War. From this Iſland I ſhaped my Courſe for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and found the N. E. Corner to lye in Lat. 18 d. North; and in Longi. Weſt from <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago</hi> 13 d. The <hi>Meridian</hi> diſtance from <hi>Tobago</hi> is 749 Miles Weſt. In our paſſage we ſaw no Land or Iſland, till we made the N. E. end of <hi>Jamaica:</hi> which lyeth in Longi. Weſt from the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> 64 d. 10 m. and VVeſt from the City of <hi>Loango</hi> 82 d. 18 m. I ſhall only add that I am of Opinion that the <hi>Gallopagos</hi> Iſlands do lye a great deal further to the Weſtward than our <hi>Hydrographers</hi> do place them, according as Mr. <hi>Dampier</hi> hints, <hi>p.</hi> 100 of his <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age round the World.</hi> I am,</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of Storms.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Storms leſs frequent, but more fierce between the Tropicks. Preſages of their coming of Norths, the times and Places where they blow: Signs of their approach: N. Banks. A Chocolatta North. A North beneficial to Ships going from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy</hi> to <hi>Jamaica.</hi> A very uncommon way of wearing a Ship in a North. Of Souths, the Times and Places where they Blow. A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a South at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and at the Bay of <hi>Campeachy:</hi> Much Fiſh kill'd by that Storm. Of Hurricanes. A Deſcription of a terrible one at <hi>Antegoe,</hi> where abundance of Fiſh and Sea Fowls were deſtroyed by it. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween North Banks, and the Clouds before an Hurricane: the latter adorned with radiant Colours. Tuffoons in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> the ſame with Hurricanes in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Of Monſoons in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> A Storm called by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi> the <hi>Elephanta,</hi> which is the violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Monſoon of that Seaſon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>STorms within the Tropicks are generally known to us by ſome Name or other, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from other common Winds: and tho' Storms are not ſo frequent there, as they are in Latitudes nearer the Poles; yet are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs expected yearly in their proper Months; and when they do come, they blow exceeding fierce,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0799400300:393"/>
though indeed ſome years they do not come at all or at leaſt do not blow with that fierceneſs as at other times. And as theſe Winds are commonly very fierce, ſo are they but of a ſhort continuance, in compariſon with Storms that we meet with in higher Latitudes.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> there are three ſorts, <hi>viz. Norths, Souths</hi> and <hi>Hurricanes:</hi> In the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> there are only two ſorts, <hi>viz. Monſoones</hi> and <hi>Tuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe ſorts of violent Storms, except the <hi>Norths,</hi> are expected near one time of the year: and this is taken notice of by thoſe that have been in any of them; that they give certain Preſages of their being at hand, ſeveral hours before they come. Norths are violent Winds, that frequently blow in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Mexico</hi> from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>March:</hi> They are chiefly expected near the full or change of the Moon, all that time of the year, but they are moſt violent in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January.</hi> Theſe Winds are not confined to the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Mexico</hi> only, but there they are moſt frequent, and rage with the greateſt Violence. They blow on the North ſide of <hi>Cuba</hi> very fierce too, and in the Gulph of <hi>Florida;</hi> as alſo about <hi>Hiſpaniola, Jamaica,</hi> &amp;c. and in the Channel between <hi>Jamaica</hi> and <hi>Portabel;</hi> and in all the Weſt Indian Sea between the Iſlands and the Main as high as the Iſland <hi>Trinidado.</hi> But from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> Eaſtward, except on the North ſide of the Iſland <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> they blow no harder than a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty briſk Sea Wind. They are here at W. N. W. or N. W. though in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Mexico</hi> they blow ſtrongeſt at N. N. W. and this is the Seaſon of Weſterly Winds in theſe Eaſt parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> as I have before noted in the third Chapter of this Diſcourſe. I ſhall be moſt particular of them that blow in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and what Signs they give us before hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0799400300:394"/>
Commonly before a North the Weather is very ſerene and fair, the Sky clear, and but little Wind; and that too veering from its proper Point, or the common Trade-Wind of the Coaſt; and breathing gently at S. at S. W. and Weſt a Day or two before the North comes. The Sea alſo gives notice of a Storm, by an extraordinary and long Ebb. For a Day or two before a North, there will be hardly any diſcernable Flood, but a conſtant ebbing of the Sea. And the Sea-Fowls alſo before a Storm, do commonly hover over the Land, which they do not at other times uſe to do, in ſuch great flights and numbers. All theſe Signs concurring, may give any Man notice of an approaching Storm, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt remarkable Sign of a North, is a very black Cloud in the N. W. riſing above the Horizon to about 10 or 12 degrees: the upper edge of the Cloud appears very even and ſmooth, and when once the upper part of the Cloud is 6, 8, 10 or 12 degrees high, there it remains in that even form parallel to the Horizon without any motion; and this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 2 or 3 Days before the Storm comes: At other times not above 12 or 14 hours, but never leſs.</p>
                  <p>This Cloud lying ſo near the Horizon, is not ſeen but in the Mornings or Evenings, at leaſt it does not appear ſo black as then; this is called by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Seamen a <hi>North Bank,</hi> and when ever we ſee ſuch a Cloud in that part of the World, and in the Months before mentioned, we certainly provide for a Storm; and tho' ſometimes it may happen that ſuch a Cloud may appear ſeveral Mornings and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings, and we may not feel the effects of it, or but very little; yet we always provide againſt it; for a North never comes without ſuch a foreboding Cloud. But if the Winds alſo whiffle about to the South, with fair flattering Weather, it never ſails. While the Wind remains at S. S. W. or any thing to the South of the Weſt, it blows very faint; but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0799400300:395"/>
when once it comes to the North of the Weſt, it begins to be briſk and veers about preſently to the North Weſt, where it blows hard; yet does it not ſtay there long before it veers to the N. N. W. and there it blows ſtrongeſt and longeſt. Sometimes it continues 24 or even 48 hours, and ſometimes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. When the Wind firſt comes to the N. W. if the black Cloud riſes and comes away, it may chance to give but one flurry, like that of a Tornado; and then the Sky grows clear again; and either the Wind continues at N. W. blowing only a briſk Gale, which the <hi>Jamaica</hi> Seamen call a <hi>Chocolatt North,</hi> or elſe it veers about again to the Eaſt, and ſettles there. But if when the Wind comes to the N. W. the Cloud ſtill remains ſettled, the Wind then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues blowing very fierce even ſo long as the black Bank continues near the Horizon. It is commonly pretty dry and clear, but ſometimes much Rain falls with a North: and tho' the Clouds which bring Rain, come from the N. W. and N. N. W. yet the black Bank near the Horizon ſeems not to move till the Heart of the Storm is broke. When the Wind ſtarts from the N. N. W. to the N. 'tis a ſign that the Violence of the Storm is paſt, eſpecially if it veers to the Eaſt of the North; for then it ſoon flies about to the Eaſt, and there ſettles at its uſual Point and brings fair Weather: But if it goes back from the N. to the N. W. it will laſt a day or two longer, as fierce as before; and not without a great deal of Rain.</p>
                  <p>When our <hi>Jamaica</hi> Logwood-ſhips are coming loaden out of the Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi> in the North Seaſon, they are glad to have a North. For a good North will bring them almoſt to <hi>Jamaica;</hi> neither have any of our Veſſels miſcarried in one of theſe Storms that I did ever hear of, though ſometimes much ſhattered; but the Spaniards do commonly ſuffer by them, and there is ſeldom a Year but one
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0799400300:396"/>
or more of them are caſt away in the Bay of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy</hi> in this Seaſon: for they don't work their ſhips as we do ours. They always bring their ſhips too under a Foreſail and Mizan, but never under a Mainſail and Mizan, nor yet under the Mizan alone; but we generally bring too under Mainſail and Mizan; and if the Wind grows too fierce we bring her under a Mizan only; and if we cannot maintain that, then we balaſt our Mizan: which is by riffing and taking up great part of the Sail. If after all this, the Winds and Seas are two high for us, then we put before it, but not before we have tryed our utmoſt, eſpecially if we are near a Leeſhore. On the contrary, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> (as I ſaid before) lye under a Foreſail and Mizan: But this muſt needs be an extraordinary ſtrain to a Ship, eſpecially if ſhe be long. Indeed there is this convenience in it, when they are minded to put away before it, 'tis but halling up the Mizan, and the Foreſail veers the Ship preſently: and I judge it is for that Reaſon they do it. For when the Wind comes on ſo fierce that they can no longer keep on a Wind, they put right afore it, and ſo continue till the Storm ceaſeth, or the Land takes them up (<hi>i. e.</hi> till they are run a-ſhore.) I knew two <hi>Spaniards</hi> did ſo, while I was in the Bay. One was a Kings ſhip, called the <hi>Piſcadore.</hi> She run aſhore on a Sandy Bay, a Mile to the Weſtward of the River <hi>Tobaſco.</hi> The other was come within 4 or 5 Leagues of the ſhore, and the Storm ceaſing, ſhe eſcaped ſhipwreck, but was taken by Captain <hi>Hewet,</hi> Commander of a Privateer, who was then in the Bay. Her Mainmaſt and Mizan were cut down in the ſtorm. Both theſe Ships came from <hi>La Vera Cruz,</hi> and were in the North ſide of the Bay when firſt the ſtorms took them. And tho' we don't nſe this method, yet we find means to wear our ſhips as well as they; for if after the Mizan is hall'd up
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0799400300:397"/>
and furled, if then the ſhip will not wear, we muſt do it with ſome Headſail, which yet ſometimes puts us to our ſhifts. As I was once in a very violent ſtorm, ſailing from <hi>Virginia,</hi> mentioned in my <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age round the World,</hi> we ſcudded before the Wind and Sea ſome time, with only our bare Poles; and the ſhip by the miſtake of him that con'd, broched too, and lay in the Trough of the Sea; which then went ſo high that every Wave threatned to overwhelm us. And indeed if any one of them had broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Deck, it might have foundred us. The Maſter, whoſe fault this was, rav'd like a mad Man, and called for an Axe to cut the Mizan Shrouds, and turn the Mizan Maſt over Board: which indeed might have been an Expedient to bring her to her courſe again. Cap. <hi>Davis</hi> was then Quarter-maſter, and a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Seamen than the Maſter. He did him hold his hand a little, in hopes to bring her ſome other way to her courſe: The Captain alſo was of his Mind. Now our Main-yard and Fore-yard were lowered down a Port laſt, as we call it, that is down pretty nigh the Deck, and the Wind blew ſo fierce that we did not dare to looſe any Head-ſail, for they muſt have blown away if we had, neither could all the Men in the ſhip have furled them again; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had no hopes of doing it that way. I was at this time on the Deck with ſome others of our Men; and among the reſt one Mr. <hi>John Small<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on,</hi> who was the main Inſtrument at that time of ſaving us all. Come ſaid he to me, let us g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a little way up the Fore-ſhrouds, it may be that may make the Ship wear; for I have been doing it before now. He never tarried for an Anſwer, but run for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preſently, and I followed him. We went up the Shrouds Half-maſt up, and there we ſpread abroad the Flaps of our Coats, and preſently the Ship wore. I think we did not ſtay there above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0799400300:398"/>
again, but in this time the Wind was got into our Mainſail, and had blown it looſe; and tho' the Main-yard was down a Port-laſt and our Men were got on the Yard as many as could lye one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beſides the Deck full of Men, and all ſtriving to furl that Sail, yet could we not do it, but were forced to cut it all along by the Head-rope, and ſo let it fall down on the Deck.</p>
                  <p>Having largely treated of Norths, I ſhall next give ſome account of Souths.</p>
                  <p>South Winds are alſo very violent Winds. I have not heard any thing of theſe ſorts of Storms, but at <hi>Jamaica</hi> or by <hi>Jamaica</hi> Sailers. The time when they blow at <hi>Jamaica</hi> is about <hi>June, July or Auguſt,</hi> Months that Norths never blow in. The greateſt ſtreſs of Wind in theſe ſtorms is at South, from whence its probable they are named <hi>Souths.</hi> In what they differ from the <hi>Hurricanes</hi> that rage among the <hi>Carribee Iſlands,</hi> I know not, unleſs in this, that they are more Conſtant to one Point of the Compaſs, or that they come ſooner in the Year than <hi>Hurricanes</hi> do, but thoſe Storms call'd <hi>Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> had never been known at <hi>Jamaica</hi> when I was there. Yet ſince I have heard that they have felt the fury of them ſeveral times. But I was at <hi>Jamaica</hi> when there happened a violent South. It made great havock in the Woods; and blew down many great Trees; but there was no great damage done by it. <hi>Port Royal</hi> was in great danger then of being waſhed away, for the Sea made a breach clear through the Town; and if the violence of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had continued but a few hours longer, many of the Houſes had been waſhed away: For the Point of Land on which that Town ſtands, is Sand; which began to waſh away apace: but the Storm cealing, there was no further damage. This was in <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Year 1674.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0799400300:399"/>
I was afterwards in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> when we had a much more violent Storm than this, called alſo by the Logwood-Cutters a <hi>South.</hi> It happened ſome time in <hi>June</hi> 1676.</p>
                  <p>I was then cutting Logwood in the Weſtern Creek of the Weſt Lagune. Two days before this ſtorm began, the Wind whiffled about to the South, and back again to the Eaſt, and blew very faintly. The Weather alſo was very fair, and the Men-of War-Birds came hovering over the Land in great numbers; which is very unuſal for them to do. This made ſome of our Logwood-Cutters ſay, that we ſhould have ſome Ships come hither in a ſhort time; for they believed it was a certain token of the arrival of Ships, when theſe Birds came thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering over the Land. And ſome of them ſaid they had lived at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where it was generally taken notice of: and that as many of theſe Birds as they ſaw hovering over the Town, ſo many Ships there were coming thither. And according to that Rule they fooliſhly gueſt that here were a great many Ships coming hither at that time: Tho' 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they could imagine there could be the hundredth part of the Ships arrive, that they ſaw Birds fly over their Heads. But that which I did moſt admire was, to ſee the Water keep ebbing for two Days together, without any flood, till the Creek, where we lived, was almoſt dry. There was commonly at low Water 7 or 8 foot Water; but now not above 3, even in the middle of the Creek.</p>
                  <p>About 4 a Clock the 2d day after this unuſual Ebb, the Sky looked very black, and the Wind ſprung up freſh at S. E. and increaſing. In leſs than two hours time it blew down all our Huts, but one; and that with much labour we propt up with Poſts, and with Ropes caſt over the Ridge, and faſtning both ends to ſtupms of Trees, we ſecured the Roof from flying away. In it we huddled altogether till the ſtorm ceaſed. It
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0799400300:400"/>
rained very hard the greateſt part of the ſtorm, and about two hours after the Wind firſt ſprang up, the Waters flowed very faſt in. The next Morning it was as high as the Banks of the Creek: which was higher than I had ever ſeen it before.</p>
                  <p>The Flood ſtill increaſed, and run faſter up the Creek than ever I ſaw it do in the greateſt Spring-Tide; which was ſomewhat ſtrange, becauſe the Wind was at South, which is right off the ſhore on this Coaſt. Neither did the Rain any thing a bate, and by 10 a Clock in the Morning the Banks of the Creek were all overflown. About 12 at Noon we brought our Canoa to the ſide of our Hut, and faſtned it to the ſtump of a Tree that ſtood by it; that being the only refuge that we could now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; for the Land a little way within the Banks of the Creek is much lower than where we were: So that there was no walking through the Woods becauſe of the Water. Beſides, the Trees were torn up by the Roots, and tumbled down ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a-croſs each other, that it was almoſt impoſſible to paſs through them.</p>
                  <p>The ſtorm continued all this Day and the Night, following till 10 a Clock: then it began to abate, and by two in the Morning it was quite calm.</p>
                  <p>This ſtorm made very ſtrange work in the Woods by tearing up the Trees by the Roots: The Ships alſo riding at <hi>Triſl</hi> and at <hi>One-Buſh-Key,</hi> felt the fury of it to their ſorrow; for of four that were riding at <hi>One-Buſh-Key,</hi> three were driven away from their Anchors, one of which was blown into the Woods of <hi>Beef-Iſland.</hi> And of the four Ships that were at <hi>Triſt,</hi> three alſo were driven from their Anchors, one of which was caſt up about 20 Paces beyond high Water Mark on the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Triſt.</hi> The other two were driven off to Sea; and one of them was never heard of ſince.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak next of <hi>Hurricanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are violent ſtorms, raging chiefly among the <hi>Carribee Iſlands;</hi> though, by Relation, <hi>Jamaica</hi> has of late been much annoyed by them; but it has been ſince the time of my being there. They are expected in <hi>July, Auguſt</hi> or <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtorms alſo as well as the Norths or Souths, give ſome ſigns of their approach before they come on. I have not been in any one of them my ſelf, but have made enquiry of many Men that have, and they all agree that either they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by flattering unuſual ſmall Winds and very fair Weather, or by a great glut of Rain, or elſe by both Rains and Calms together.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give an Inſtance of one that gave ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It happened at <hi>Antego</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1681. I had the Relation of it from Mr. <hi>John Smallbone,</hi> before mentioned, who was Gunner of a Ship of 120 Tuns and 10 Guns, Commanded by Capt. <hi>Gadbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this ſtorm it rained two days exceſſively, then it held up two or three days more: but the Sky was clouded and appear'd to be much troubled, yet but little Wind. The Planters by this, were certain of a Hurricane, and warned the Ship-Commanders to provide for it, eſpecially Capt. <hi>Gadbury;</hi> who had careen'd his Ship in <hi>Muskito Cove</hi> in <hi>St. John's Harbour,</hi> but a little before, and by this warning given him by the Planters, had gotten his Goods on
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0799400300:402"/>
Board again, which though all he had, yet was but about half his lading of Sugar, Moloſſes and Rum. He alſo moored his Ship as ſecure as he could, with all his Cablesand Anchors, beſides ſome Cables which he had made faſt aſhore to great Trees. And about 7 a Clock that evening that the ſtorm came, he drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, went aſhore with all his Men, and retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a poor Planters Houſe about half a Mile from the ſhore. By that time he and his Men were arrived at the Houſe, which was before 8 a Clock; the Wind came on very fierce at N. E. and veering about to the N. and N. W. ſettled there, bringing with it very violent Rains. Thus it continued about four hours, and then fell flat calm, and the Rain ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>In this Calm he ſent 3 or 4 of his Men down to the <hi>Cove</hi> to ſee what condition the Ship was in, and they found her driven aſhore dry on the Sand, lying on one ſide, with the Head of her Maſt ſticking into the Sand; after they had walked round her and view'd her a while, they return'd again to the Capt. to give him an Account of the Diſaſter, and made as much haſte as they could, becauſe the Wind began to blow hard at S. W. and it blew ſo violently before they recover'd the Houſe, that the Boughs of the Trees whipt them ſufficiently before they got thither; and it rained as hard as before. The little Houſe could ſcarce ſhelter them from the wet; for there was little beſide the Walls ſtanding: For the 1ſt Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Guſt blew away great part of the Ridg and moſt of the Thatch. Yet there they ſtayed till the next Morning, and then coming to the Ship found her almoſt upright; but all the Goods that were in the Hold were waſh'd out, and the Sugar was waſh'd out of the Cask. Some of the Rum they found; a Cask in one place and a Cask in another: ſome on the ſhore, and ſome half a Mile in the Woods; and ſome ſtav'd againſt the Trees and leek'd out; for it ſeems there had been a violent Motion in the Sea, as well
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0799400300:403"/>
as in the Air. For in the beginning of the Night when the N. E. Guſt raged, the Sea ebb'd ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, or elſe was driven off the ſhore by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Wind ſo far, that ſome Ships riding in the Harbour in 3 or 4 fathom Water, were a ground; and lay ſo till the S. W. Guſt came, and then the Sea came rowling in again with ſuch prodigious fury, that it not only ſet them a-float, but daſh'd many of them on the ſhore. One of them was carried up a great way into the Woods: another was ſtrangely hurl'd on two Rocks that ſtood cloſe by one another; with her Head reſting on one Rock, and her Stern on the other: And thus ſhe lay like a Bridge between the two Rocks, about 10 or 11 Foot above the Sea, even in the higheſt Tides; for the Tides do uſually riſe here but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, not above 2 or 3 Foot, but in theſe Hurricanes it always ebbs and flows again prodigiouſly.</p>
                  <p>It was not the Ships only that felt the fury of this Storm, but the whole Iſland ſuffered by it; for the Houſes were blown down, the Trees tore up by the Roots, or had their Heads and Limbs ſadly ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, neither was there any Leaves, Herbs or green Thing left on the Iſland, but all look'd like Winter. Inſomuch that a Ship coming thither a little after, that uſed that Trade, could ſcarce believe it to be the ſame Iſland. Neither did the fury of this Storm light only here, for <hi>Nevis</hi> and St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> had their ſhares alſo; but <hi>Mountſurat</hi> felt little of it, tho' not above a Fortnight after there happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Storm, as violent as this, and raged extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, but did little damage at <hi>Nevis</hi> and St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers. Antego</hi> had a great ſhare of this too. Capt. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Ship, that lay a-ground before it came, was by it hurled over to the oppoſite part of the Harbour, and there thrown dry on the Sand.</p>
                  <p>The day after the ſtorm, the ſhore was ſtrew'd with Fiſh of divers ſorts, as well great as ſmall;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0799400300:404"/>
ſuch as Porpoiſes, Sharks, &amp;c. and abundance of Sea Fowls alſo were deſtroyed by it.</p>
                  <p>I would not have any Man think that theſe Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes, or any other Storms, do always give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their coming exactly alike: For there may be ſome difference in thoſe ſigns, tho' all of them be plain enough if well obſerved. Beſides ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are duplicated, ſometimes only ſingle ſigns, and ſometimes the ſigns may be more viſible and plain than at other times: when by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental cauſe thoſe ſigns may be leſs viſible by Reaſon of ſome high Hill or Mountain that may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd between you and the Horizon, eſpecially if any Hill lies N. E. from you, which is the Quarter that Hurricanes do commonly riſe in.</p>
                  <p>The Clouds that precede a Hurricane are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the North Banks, in this, that whereas the Clouds preceding Norths are uniform and regular; of an exact blackneſs even from the Horizon to the upper edg of it, and that as ſtreight and even as a Line ſtretched out. On the contrary, the Hurricane-Clouds tower up their Heads, preſſing forwards as if they all ſtrove for precedency; yet ſo linked one within another, that all move alike. Beſides, the edges of theſe Clouds are guilded with various and afrighting Colours, the very edg of all ſeems to be of a pale fire colour, next that of a dull yellow, and nearer the Body of the Cloud of a Copper Colour, and the Body of the Cloud which is very thick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears extraordinary Black: and altogether it looks very terrible and amazing even beyond expreſſion. Tho' I have never been in any Hurricane in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> yet I have ſeen the very Image of them in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and the effects have been the very ſame; and for my part I know no difference between a Hurricane among the Carribee Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and a Tuffoon on the Coaſt of <hi>China</hi> in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0799400300:405"/>
                     <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> but only the Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I am apt to believe that both Words have one ſignification, which is a <hi>violent Storm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have given a large Account of one of theſe in my <hi>Voyage round the World:</hi> Chapter XV. Page 414. That gave warning by flattering Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before hand, and a very diſmal Cloud, ſet out with ſuch colours as I have before deſcribed, riſing in the N. E. from whence the violence of the firſt Guſt came, which was wonderful fierce and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with extraordinary hard Rain; then it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fell calm about an hour, and then the Wind came about at S. W. and blew as fierce as it did before at N. E. which is much like the Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane before-mentioned at <hi>Antego,</hi> but of a longer continuance than that: Beſides, in both places they blow at one time of the Year, which is in <hi>July, Auguſt</hi> or <hi>September;</hi> and commonly near the Full or Change of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>Another thing that we muſt alſo take notice of is, that both Places are North of the Equator, though not exactly in one Latitude.</p>
                  <p>But of theſe Tuffoons I ſhall ſay no more now, having deſcribed them particularly in my Voyage to <hi>Tonquin,</hi> Chap. II. Pag. 36.</p>
                  <p>The Monſoons in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> are the next to be treated of; by which I do not mean the Coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade-wind, ſo called, which I have already deſcribed in Page 21. of this Diſcourſe; for tho' [<hi>Monſoon</hi>] is a general word for the Wind there, diſtinguiſhed by Eaſt or Weſt, according to the Points from whence they blow; yet it ſometimes alſo ſignifies a <hi>Storm,</hi> as I now take it. And it is eaſie to be underſtood, when it is uſed in reference to the Trade-wind, or when ſpoken of a Storm; for if applied to a Storm, 'tis expreſs'd by ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pethite going before: As Violent, Terrible,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0799400300:406"/>
&amp;c. without any diſtinction of Eaſt or Weſt, which is commonly uſed in ſpeaking of the Trade-Wind.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Monſoons or Storms on the Coaſt of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romandel</hi> are expected either about <hi>April</hi> or <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> which are accounted the two ſhifting Months. For in theſe two Months the Winds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhift and turn from that Point, on which they have blown ſeveral Months before, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Points of the Compaſs; as from Eaſt to Weſt, or the contrary: but commonly this ſhift is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a turbulent Sky, which ends in a violent ſtorm of Wind, or exceſſive Rains, or both: And this is called alſo the breaking up of the Monſoon. It was in one of theſe that I paſt from <hi>Nicobar</hi> Iſland to <hi>Sumatra,</hi> mentioned in my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> Chap. XVIII. Page 496. This was the <hi>April</hi> Monſoon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Septemb</hi> Monſoons are generally more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than theſe laſt: yet by the Account I have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had from <hi>Fort</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> they have ſuffered ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much by one of the <hi>April</hi> Monſoons (if it may be ſo called) for it came before its uſual time, even before it could be expected.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>September</hi> Monſoons, tho' the time of the Year is ſo well known, and the warnings of their approach almoſt certain; yet our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Merchants have had very conſiderable loſſes there; for the ſtreſs of the Winds blows right in upon the ſhore, and often hurries the Ships from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and toſſes them in a moment on the ſandy Bay.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the want of a ſecure Place to Ride in, is the greateſt Inconvenience of that Factory, a Place doubtleſs deſigned by the Engliſh from its Original to be the Center of the Trade of theſe Parts. For all our Factories, and the Trade in general, Eaſt from Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi> are now ſubordinate to this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0799400300:407"/>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> had once a place of Conſequence, called <hi>Pallacat,</hi> on this Coaſt, about 20 Leagues to the North of it; but they withdrew moſt of their Families and Effects from thence in the Year 1691. mentioned in my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> Chap. XX. Page 522. And it is very probable that theſe rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winds might be one cauſe of this their deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, whatever was the Motive of ſettling here; for they have ſecure Harbours, and Roads enough in <hi>India,</hi> which we to our great diſadvantage very much want.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the Monſoons.</p>
                  <p>Theſe (as I have told you) blow fierceſt in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and, as I have been informed, blow on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points of the Compaſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſtormy Monſoons on the <hi>Mallabar</hi> Coaſt differ from theſe on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> in that they are more common, and laſt even from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> which is as long as the common Weſt Monſoon laſts, though not ſo frequent and laſting in the beginning of the Monſoon, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end.</p>
                  <p>The Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> afford very bad Weather, for then there is hardly any intermiſſion; but a continued troubled Sky full of black Clouds which pour down exceſſive Rains, and often very fierce Winds. But towards the breaking up of the Monſoon, they have one very terrible Storm called by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> the <hi>Eliphanta,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the bad Weather. For after that they put to Sea without fear of any more Storms that Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe violent Winds blow directly in upon the ſhore; and they dam up the Harbours on this Coaſt, eſpecially that of <hi>Goa,</hi> ſo that no Ships can go in or come out then; but after the violent Winds are paſt, the Channel opens again, and ſo continues till the next Seaſon.</p>

This Relation I had from a very ingenious Gentleman who was at <hi>Goa</hi> during the bad Weather.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only take notice that theſe Storms are alſo at the ſame time of the Year, when the Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes and Souths are in the Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> and the Tuffoons on the Coaſts of <hi>China, Tunqueen, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinchina</hi> and <hi>Cambodia</hi> in the Eaſtern Parts of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and that all theſe Places are to the North of the Equator.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Wet and Dry Seaſons on the North ſide of the Equator; and on the South of it. Places fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for much dry Weather; as part of <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> A Compariſon between thoſe Coaſts. Of raining Coaſts; as <hi>Guinea.</hi> Why <hi>Guinea</hi> more ſubject to Rains than the oppoſite Coaſt of <hi>Brazil.</hi> The time of Sugar-making.

Mountains more ſubject to Rains than Low Land; An inſtance of this at <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica.</hi> The Iſle of <hi>Pines</hi> near <hi>Cuba,</hi> a wet Place. So is alſo <hi>Gorgonia</hi> in the South Seas. The manner how Tornadoes ariſe.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS Summer and Winter are the two moſt different Seaſons in our Climate; ſo the Dry and the Wet are within the torrid Zone; and are always oppoſite to each other. They are often called by Europeans <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer,</hi> but more generally, <hi>Dry</hi> and <hi>Wet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Seaſons on each ſide of the Equator, are as different as the Seaſons of Summer and Winter are in temperate Climates, or near each Pole. For as 'tis Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer near the North Pole, when 'tis Winter near the South Pole, and the contrary: ſo when 'tis fair and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0799400300:410"/>
dry Weather North of the Equator, 'tis bluſtering and rainy Weather South of it, and the contrary; except within a few degrees of the Line, and that in ſome places only.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo this difference between the Torrid and Temperate Zones, either North or South of the Equator; that when it is fair and dry Weather in the one, it is Winter in the other: and when it is wet in the one, it is Summer in the other. I ſpeak now of Places lying on the ſame ſide of the Equator: For as the Sun when it paſſes the Equinox, and draws towards either of the Tropicks, begins to warm their reſpective Poles, and by how much the nearer he approaches, by ſo much is the Air without the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks clear, dry and hot. On the contrary, within the Torrid Zone (though on the ſame ſide of the Line) the farther the Sun is off, the drier is the Weather. And as the Sun comes nearer, the sky grows more cloudy and the Weather more moiſt: for the Rains follow the Sun, and begin on either ſide of the Equator, within a little while after the Sun has croſt the Equinox, and ſo continue till after his return back again.</p>
                  <p>The wet Seaſon on the North ſide of the Equator in the torrid Zone, begins in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> and ſo continues till <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The dry Weather comes in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> and continues till <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In South Latitudes the Weather changes at the ſame times, but with this difference, that the dry Months in South Latitude, are wet Months in North Latitude, and the contrary, as I have ſaid before. Yet neither do the wet or dry Seaſons ſet in or go out exactly at one time, in all Years; neither are all places ſubject to wet or dry Weather alike. For in ſome places it rains leſs than in others; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is more dry Weather. But generally
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0799400300:411"/>
Places that lye under the Line, or near it, have their greateſt Rains in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Head-Lands or Coaſts that lye moſt expoſed to the Trade-winds have commonly the beſt ſhare of dry Weather. On the contrary, deep Bays or bendings of the Land, eſpecially ſuch as lye near the Line, are moſt ſubject to Rains. Yet even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Bays or Bendings, there is a great deal of difference in the Weather as to dry or wet; for the Weather, as well as the Winds ſeem to be much influenced by accidental Cauſes; and thoſe Cauſes themſelves, whatever they are, ſeem to be ſubject to great variation.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed with Matter of Fact; I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the drieſt Coaſts; and firſt with that of <hi>Peru,</hi> from 3 d. South 30 d. South. There it never Rains, neither at Sea for a good diſtance off ſhore, as for 250 or 300 Leagues; no nor on the ſhore for a conſiderable way within Land; though exactly how far I know not; yet there are ſmall Miſts, ſometimes in a Morning for two or three Hours; but ſeldom continuing after 10 a Clock; and there are Dews alſo in the Night.</p>
                  <p>This Coaſt lies N. and S. it has the Sea open to the Weſt, and a chain of very high Mountains running a long ſhore on the Eaſt, and the Winds conſtantly Southerly, as I ſaid before in the ſecond Chapter of Winds.</p>
                  <p>In which Head I have made a Compariſon as well of the Winds on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> in the ſame Latitude, as of the lying of the Coaſts. Only there is this difference, that the coaſting Trade-winds on the American ſide do blow further from the Land than thoſe on the African ſide. Which difference may probably ariſe from the diſporportion of the Mountains that are in the two Continents; for 'tis known that the <hi>Andes</hi> in <hi>America</hi> are ſome of the higheſt Mountains in the World, but whether there
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0799400300:412"/>
are any on the Continent of <hi>Africa</hi> in thoſe Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ſo high, I know not. I have not heard of any, at leaſt none ſuch are viſible to Seamen.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeak of the Weather on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican Coaſt, which though 'tis not ſo dry as the Coaſt of <hi>Peru,</hi> yet is it the next to it. The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is very dry from <hi>March</hi> till <hi>October,</hi> which is the dry Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>The rainy Seaſon, which is from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>March,</hi> is moderate, without that exceſs that is in moſt other Places in thoſe Latitudes; ſo that the wetteſt Seaſon can only be called ſo from ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhowers of Rain.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Tornadoes, but not ſo many as are in any other Places, both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> the <hi>Peruvian Coaſt</hi> excepted. And if the height of the <hi>Andes</hi> are the cauſe that the true Eaſt Breez does not take place in the Pacifick Sea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 200 Leagues diſtance from the ſhore, when yet the Trade blows within 40 Leagues of the African Coaſt; that Coaſt may perhaps be ſuppoſed to want ſuch high Mountains. And if thoſe American Mountains do ſtop the Winds from their Career, why may they not as well break the Clouds before they reach near the ſhore, and be the cauſe of the dry Weather there? And ſeeing both Coaſts do lye alike, and the Wind is alike; why ſhould not the Weather be the ſame; were it not for the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Mountains of theſe Coaſts? For the Eaſt ſide of thoſe Mountains are ſupplied with Rain enough, as may be known by the great Rivers that diſembogue from thence into the Atlantick Sea; whereas the Rivers on the South Sea Coaſt are but very few and ſmall; ſome of which do wholly dry away for a good part of the Year; but yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly break out again in their Seaſons, when the Rains in the Country do come, which always fall on
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0799400300:413"/>
the Weſt ſide of thoſe Mountains, and this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>February.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I have ſpoken before of dry Coaſts, ſo now I ſhall ſpeak of rainy ones. I ſhall begin with the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> from Cape <hi>Lopos,</hi> which lies one degree South, taking in the Bite or Bending of the Land, and all the Coaſt Weſt from thence, as far as Cape <hi>Palmas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a very wet Coaſt, ſubject to violent Tornadoes and exceſſive Rains, eſpecially in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt:</hi> In thoſe Months there is ſcarce any fair Day. This Coaſt lies all of it very near the Equator, and no where above 6 or 7 degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſo that from its nearneſs to the Equator only, we might probably conjecture that it is a rainy Coaſt; for moſt places lying near the Line are very ſubject to Rains: yet ſome more than others; and <hi>Guinea</hi> may be reckoned among the wetteſt Places in the World. There may be Places where the Rains continue longer, but none are more violent while they laſt.</p>
                  <p>And as its nearneſs to the Line may be a great cauſe of its moiſture; ſo by its ſituation alſo one would gueſs that it ſhould be ſubject to a great deal of Rain; becauſe there is a great Bite or Bending in of the Land, a little to the North of the Line; and from thence the Land ſtretcheth Weſt parallel with the Line. And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Circumſtances ſingly taken, according to my obſervations do ſeldom fail, but more eſpecially where they both meet. Yet there may be other cauſes that may hinder thoſe Effects, or at leaſt ſerve to allay the violence of them, as they do on ſome other Coaſts. I ſhall only inſtance in the oppoſite Coaſt of <hi>America</hi> between the North Cape, which lies North of the Equator, and Cape <hi>Blanco</hi> on <hi>Brazil,</hi> in South Latitude. Now this Land lies much after the Form of the Coaſt of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> with this difference, that one Coaſt lies in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0799400300:414"/>
South Lat. the other lies North of the Equator, both of theſe Promontories lay parallel with the Equator, and there's not much difference in their diſtance from it; but that which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that one juts out Weſtward, the other Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and ſo one is the very Weſtermoſt Land of the Continent of <hi>Africa,</hi> the other is the Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Land of the Continent of <hi>America:</hi> The one has only an eddy Wind, which ſeems to me to be the Effect of two contrary Winds: The other Coaſt lies open to the Trade, and never wants a Breez. And the former is troubled with Tornadoes and violent Rains during the wet Seaſon, which is <hi>May, June, July, Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September:</hi> But the extreameſt wet Months are <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt;</hi> when it Rains in a manner continually. <hi>April</hi> and <hi>October</hi> alſo ſometimes are wet Months.</p>
                  <p>The other Coaſt on the <hi>American</hi> Continent, which lies open to the E. and N. E. or S. E. and which enjoys the freer Trade-Wind, is leſs ſubject to Rain; only as it lies near the Line, it has its part, but not to exceſs, nor in any compariſon with <hi>Guinea.</hi> And as the Line is to the N. of it, ſo its wet Months are from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>April,</hi> and the dry Seaſon from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>October.</hi> And theſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reach even to 6 or 7 degrees North of the Line: Which I do not know to be ſo in any other part of the World again. Indeed Cape <hi>Lopes</hi> in <hi>Guinea,</hi> is in one degree South, yet participates of the ſame Weather that the reſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> has, which lies to the North of the Line.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why <hi>Europeans</hi> do account the dry Seaſon Summer, and the wet Seaſon Winter, is becauſe the dry Seaſon is their Harveſt time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our Plantations, where we chiefly make Sugar; for then the Canes are as yellow as Gold. They have then indeed leſs juice, but that little there is, is very ſweet. Whereas in the wet Seaſon, tho'
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0799400300:415"/>
the Canes are ripe, and come to their Maturity; yet do they not yield ſuch quantities of Sugar, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſo good, tho' the pains in boiling it be alſo greater. Therefore in Northern Climates, as all our Plantations are in, they commonly begin to work about making of Sugar at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> after the dry Seaſon has brought the Canes to a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But in South Climates, as on the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> they begin to work in <hi>July.</hi> Some Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there are in the North Latitudes alſo near the Line, where the Weather bears time with the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in South Lat. as at <hi>Suranam,</hi> which tho' it is in North Lat. yet are the Seaſons there the ſame as in South Latitudes; but I know not ſuch another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance any where. And tho' the dry Seaſon is the time to gather in the Canes, and the wet Seaſon to plant, yet are they not ſo limited as to make uſe only of theſe Seaſons for either, but do it chiefly for their beſt convenience; for they may plant at any time of the Year, and that with good ſucceſs, eſpecially after a moderate ſhower of Rain, which often happens even in the dry Seaſons.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt proceed.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid before, that Bays have greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Rain than Head-Lands.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi> is a good Inſtance of this, for the Rains are very great there, eſpecially in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi> On the contrary, the Coaſt from Cape <hi>Catoch,</hi> to Cape <hi>Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cedo,</hi> which lies more expoſed to the Trade, has not near the Rains as the Bay of <hi>Campeachy</hi> hath.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Honduras</hi> alſo is very wet, and all that bending Coaſt from Cape <hi>Gratia de Dios,</hi> even to <hi>Carthagena.</hi> But on the Coaſt of <hi>Caraccos,</hi> and about Cape <hi>La Vela,</hi> where the Breezes are more brisk, the Weather is more moderate. Whereas in thoſe little Bays between, there is ſtill a difference: For in the Bay of <hi>Mericaya,</hi> which lies a little to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0799400300:416"/>
the Eaſt of Cape <hi>La Vela,</hi> there is much more Rain than at or near the Cape.</p>
                  <p>The Bay of <hi>Panama</hi> alſo will furniſh us with a proof of this, by its Immoderate Rains; eſpecially the South ſide of it, even from the Gulph of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> to Cape St. <hi>Francis;</hi> the Rains there are from <hi>April</hi> till <hi>November;</hi> but in <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they are moſt violent.</p>
                  <p>There are many ſmall Bays alſo Weſt from the Bay of <hi>Panama,</hi> which have their ſhares of theſe wet Seaſons, as the Gulph of <hi>Dulce, Caldera</hi> Bay, <hi>Amapala,</hi> &amp;c. but to the Weſt of that, where the Coaſt runs more plain and even, there are not ſuch wet Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet many times very violent Tornadoes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> alſo has many Bays that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to very violent Rains, as the Bay of <hi>Tonqueen,</hi> that of <hi>Siam,</hi> the bottom and the Eaſt ſide of the Bay of <hi>Bengall.</hi> But on the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> which is the Weſt-ſide of that Bay, the Weather is more moderate; that being an even, plain, low Coaſt. But on the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar,</hi> which is on the Weſt ſide of that Promontory, the Land is high and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and there are violent Rains. Indeed the Weſt ſides of any Continents are wetter than the Eaſt ſides, the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> only excepted; in the former of which the drineſs may be occaſioned (as is ſaid before) by the height of the <hi>Andes.</hi> And 'tis probable that the violence of the Rains near thoſe Mountains falls chiefly on the Eaſt-ſides of them, and ſeldom reaches to their Tops: which yet if the Rains do, they may there be broke in pieces, and reach no further. For, among other Obſervations, I have taken notice, that Mountains are ſupplied with more Rains than low Lands; I mean the low Land bordering on the Sea. As for inſtance, the South ſide of <hi>Jamaica</hi> beginning at <hi>Leganea,</hi> and from thence away to the Weſtward, as far as Black River, including all the plain Land and Savannahs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0799400300:417"/>
about St. <hi>Jago de la Vego, Old Harbour</hi> and <hi>Withy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> Savannahs. This is a plain level Country for many Miles lying near Eaſt and Weſt, having the Sea on the South, and bounded with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the North.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Mountains are commonly ſupplied with Rain before the low Lands. I have known the Rains to have begun there three Weeks before any has fallen in the plain Country, bordering on the Sea; yet every Day I have obſerved very black Clouds over the Mountains, and have heard it Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there. And thoſe very Clouds have ſeemed by their Motion to draw towards the Sea, but have been check'd in their Courſe, and have either returned towards the Mountains again, or elſe have ſpent themſelves before they came from thence, and ſo have vaniſhed away again, to the great Grief of the Planters, whoſe Plantations and Cattle have ſuffered for want of a little Moiſture. Nay, theſe Tornadoes have been ſo nigh, that the Sea Breeze has dyed away, and we have had the Wind freſh out of the Clouds, yet they have vaniſhed, and yielded no Rain to the low parch'd Lands.</p>
                  <p>And I think that the want of ſeaſonable Showers is one of the greateſt Inconveniencies that this part of the Country ſuffers; for I have known in ſome very dry Years, that the Graſs in the Savannahs has been burned and wither'd for want of Rain, and the Cattle have periſhed thereby for want of Food. The Plantations alſo have ſuffered very much by it; but ſuch dry Seaſons have not been known on the North-ſide of the Iſland, where the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are bordering on the Sea, or at leaſt but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance off it. For there they are ſupplied with ſeaſonable Showers almoſt all the Year, and even in the dry time it ſelf, near the Full and Change of the Moon. But in the wet Seaſon, the Rains are more violent, which is their Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0799400300:418"/>
As for the Valleys in the Country, they are not ſubject to ſuch Droughts as the plain Land by the Sea, at leaſt I have not obſerved it my ſelf, nor have I heard it mentioned by others.</p>
                  <p>The Iſle of <hi>Pines</hi> near <hi>Cuba,</hi> is ſo noted a Place for Rain, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inhabiting near it on <hi>Cuba,</hi> ſay, that it Rains more or leſs every Day in the Year, at one Place or another. It is generally ſpoken alſo and believ'd by Privateers, for it has been oft viſited by them. I have been there my ſelf, but cannot confirm that Report. However, it is well known to be a very wet and rainy Place.</p>
                  <p>It is but a ſmall Iſland of about 9 or 10 Leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad; and in the midſt is a high picked Mountain, which is commonly clouded; and the Privateers ſay that this Hill draws all the Clouds to it; for if there is not another Cloud to be ſeen any where elſe, yet this Hill is ſeldom or never clear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gorgonia</hi> in the South Seas alſo has the ſame Report. It is much ſmaller than <hi>Pines.</hi> I have mentioned it in my <hi>Voyage round the World.</hi> Chap. VII. Page 172.</p>
                  <p>This Iſle lies about 4 Leagues from the Main: but the Iſle of <hi>Pines</hi> not above 2, and is a great deal bigger than it. The Main againſt <hi>Gorgonia</hi> is very low Land; but <hi>Cuba</hi> near <hi>Pines</hi> is pretty high, and the Mountain of <hi>Pines</hi> is much bigger and higher than the Hill of <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> which yet is of a good height, ſo that it may be ſeen 16 or 18 Leagues off; and tho' I cannot ſay that it Rains every Day there, yet I know that it Rains very much and extraordinary hard.</p>
                  <p>I have been at this Iſle three times; and always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound it very rainy, and the Rains very violent. I remember when we touch'd there in our return from Capt. <hi>Sharp,</hi> we boiled a Kettle of Chocolate before we clean'd our Bark; and having every Man
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0799400300:419"/>
his Callabaſh full, we began to ſup it off, ſtanding all the time in the Rain; but I am confident not a Man among us all did clear his Diſh, for it rained ſo faſt, and ſuch great drops into our Callabaſhes, that after we had ſup'd off as much Chocolate and Rain-water together as ſufficed us, our Callabaſhes were ſtill above half full; and I heard ſome of the Menſwear that they could not ſup it up ſo faſt as it rained in: At laſt I grew tir'd with what I had left, and threw it away; and moſt of the reſt did ſo likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>As Clouds do uſually hover over Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſo do they alſo keep near the Land. I have mentioned ſomething of this in my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> Chap. X. Page 283. where I have ſaid, that in making Land we commonly find it Cloudy over the Land, tho' 'tis clear every where beſide: And this may ſtill confirm what I have ſaid in the foregoing Diſcourſe, that Hills are commonly cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for high Land is the firſt diſcerned by us, and that, as I ſaid before, is commonly clouded. But now I ſhall ſpeak how we find the Clouds, when we are but a little way from Land, either coaſting along the ſhore, or at an Anchor by it. I hope the Reader will not imagine that I am going to prove that it never Rains at Sea, or but very little there; for the contrary is known to every Body, and I have already ſaid in this Diſcourſe of Winds in my firſt Chapter, That there are very frequent Tornadoes in ſeveral Seas, eſpecially near the Equator, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea. Other Seas are not ſo much troubled with them; neither is the <hi>Atlantick</hi> ſo to the North or South of the Line; eſpecially at any conſiderable diſtance from the ſhore, but yet 'tis very probable however, that the Sea has not ſo great a portion of Tornadoes as the Land hath. For when we are near the ſhore within the Torrid Zone, we often ſec it Rain on the Land, and perceive it to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0799400300:420"/>
very cloudy there, when it is fair at Sea, and ſcarce a Cloud to be ſeen that way. And tho' we have the Wind from the Shore, and the Clouds ſeeming to be drawing off, yet they often wheel about again to the Land, as if they were Magnetically drawn that way: Sometimes indeed they do come off a little; but then they uſually either return again or elſe inſenſibly vaniſh; and that's the Reaſon that Seamen when they are ſailing near the Shore and ſee a Tornado coming off, they don't much mind it, but cry, <hi>The Land will devour it:</hi> But however, ſometimes they fly off to Sea; and 'tis very rare that Tornadoes ariſe from thence; for they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally riſe firſt over the Land, and that in a very ſtrange manner; for even from a very ſmall Cloud ariſing over the top of a Hill, I have often ſeen it increaſe to ſuch a bulk, that I have known it Rain for 2 or 3 Days ſucceſſively. This I have obſerved both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and in the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North Seas.</hi> And 'tis impoſſible for me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how oft I have been diſturbed by ſuch ſmall Clouds that appeared in the Night. 'Tis uſual with Seamen in thoſe parts to ſleep on the Deck, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for Privateers; among whom I made theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. In Privateers, eſpecially when we are at an Anchor, the Deck is ſpread with Mats to lie on each Night. Every Man has one, ſome two; and this with a Pillow for the Head, and a Rug for a Covering, is all the Bedding that is neceſſary for Men of that Employ.</p>
                  <p>I have many times ſpread my Lodging, when the Evening has promiſed well, yet have been forced to withdraw before Day; and yet it was not a little Rain that would afright me then; neither at its firſt coming could I have thought that ſuch a ſmall Cloud could afford ſo much Rain: And oftentimes both my ſelf and others have been ſo deceived by the appearance of ſo ſmall a Cloud, that thinking the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0799400300:421"/>
Rain would ſoon be over, we have lain till we were dropping wet, and then have been forced to move at laſt. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>I have conſtantly obſerved, that in the wet Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have had more Rain in the Night than in the Day; for tho' it was fair in the Day, yet we ſeldom eſcaped having a Tornado or two in the Night. If we had one in the Day, it roſe and came away preſently, and it may be we had an Hour's Rain, more or leſs; but when it came in the Night, tho' there was little appearance of Rain, yet we ſhould have it 3 or 4 hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but this has commonly been nigh the Shore; and we have ſeen thick Clouds over the Land, and much Thunder and Lightning; and to our appearance, there was more Rain there than we had; and probably out farther off at Sea, there might be ſtill leſs, for it was commonly pretty clear that way.</p>

                  <p>And by the way Note. That,</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Tides</hi> I mean Flowings and Ebbings of the Sea, on or off from any Coaſt. Which property of the Sea ſeems to be Univerſal, though not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly alike on all Coaſts, neither as to Time nor the height of the Water.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Currents</hi> I mean another Motion of the Sea, which is different from Tides in ſeveral Reſpects, both as to its Duration, and alſo as to its Courſe.</p>
                  <p>Tides may be compar'd to the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land-Breezes,</hi> in reſpect to their keeping near the ſhoar; tho' indeed they alternately flow and ebb twice in 24 hours. Contrarily the Sea Breezes blow on the ſhoar by Day, and the Land Winds off from it in the Night, yet they keep this Courſe as duly in a manner as the Tides do. Neither are the Tides, nor thoſe Breezes, far from the Land.</p>
                  <p>Currents may be compar'd to the <hi>Coaſting Trade-Winds,</hi> as keeping at ſome farther diſtance from the ſhoar, as the Trade-winds do; and 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they are much influenced by them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a general belief, eſpecially among Seamen, That the Tides are governed by the Moon: That their Increaſe and Decreaſe, as well as their Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motions, are influenced by that Planet; tho' ſometimes accidental Cauſes in the Winds may hinder the true regularity thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0799400300:424"/>
We are taught, as the firſt Rudiments of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to ſhift our Tides; <hi>i. e.</hi> to know the Time of full Sea in any Place; which indeed is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known by all Engliſh Sailors, becauſe the Tides are more regular in our Channel, than in other parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>But my ſubject being to ſpeak of the Tides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or near the Tropick, I leave thoſe in places nearer <hi>England</hi> to be diſcourſed on by Coaſters, who are the only knowing Men in this Myſtery: They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Experience gained more knowledge in it than others; and that is always the beſt Maſter.</p>
                  <p>I have not been on any Coaſt in the World, but where the Tides have ebb'd and flow'd, either more or leſs; and this I have commonly obſerv'd, that the greateſt Indraughts of Rivers or Lagunes, have commonly the ſtrongeſt Tides. Contrarily ſuch Coaſts as are leaſt ſupplied with Rivers or Lakes have the weakeſt Tides; at leaſt they are not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible. Where there are great Indraughts either of Rivers or Lagunes, and thoſe Rivers or Lagunes are wide, tho' the Tide runs very ſtrong into the Mouths of ſuch Rivers or Lagunes, yet it does not flow ſo high as in ſuch Places where the Rivers or Lakes are bounded in a narrow Room, tho' the Tides do run of an equal ſtrength at the Mouths o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Entrances of either. Neither do the Tides flow ſo much on or about Iſlands remote from the main Land, as they do on the Coaſts of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall firſt give ſome Inſtances of theſe general Obſervations, and then proceed to Particulars.</p>
                  <p>The Places that I ſhall mention ſhall be ſuch as I have been in my ſelf, and where I have made the Obſervations before mentioned; I ſhall begin with the Lagune of <hi>Trieſt,</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Place is very remarkable, in that it has two Mouths of a conſiderable bigneſs; the one is about a Mile and half wide, and about two Mile thro',

                     </gap> than the former.</p>
                  <p>The Tides that flow or ebb in all the Lagunes paſs in or out at the two Mouths before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which makes them run very ſwift, inſomuch, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have named that Great Lagune <hi>Laguna Termina,</hi> or, the Lake of Tides; becauſe the Tides are ſo very ſtrong in thoſe two Mouths. Yet, tho' the Tides do run ſo ſwift at the Mouth of the Lagune, they do not riſe in height proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that ſwiftneſs; for the greateſt Tides here do not riſe or fall above 6 or 7 Foot, except forced by extraordinary Cauſes, as Storms, or the like: Of which I have ſpoken before.</p>
                  <p>I could alſo inſtance in the Channel; between the 2 Capes of <hi>Virginia,</hi> where the Tides do run very ſwift; yet the Floods and Ebbs are not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſwiftneſs of the Tides between the Capes. There are not indeed ſuch Lagunes, as at <hi>Trieſt</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Campeachy;</hi> but there are many wide Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and abundance of ſmaller Creeks. Beſides, in ſome places there is low Land, which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown by the Tides; ſo that all the Water that runs in with ſuch ſwiftneſs within the Capes is inſenſibly ſwallowed up there.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are inſtances of ſtrong Tides, occaſioned by great Indraughts; yet where there is but little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Falling of the Water in compariſon with the ſtrength of the Tides at the Mouths of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draughts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall only mention two Rivers in the South Sea, that I have taken Notice of in my <hi>Voyage round the World, (viz.)</hi> the Gulph of <hi>St. Michael;</hi> and the River of <hi>Guiaquill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Gulph of <hi>St. Michael</hi> there are many large Rivers, which all diſembogue into a Lagune of 2 or 3 Leagues wide. This Lagune is barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed from the Sea with ſome ſmall low Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grovy Iſlands, and between them are Creeks and Channels, through which the Tides make their daily paſſes into the Lagune; and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rivers, and ſo back again; many times over-flowing the ſaid Iſlands, and leaving the tops of the lower Trees above Water.</p>
                  <p>The Rivers that run into this Lagune are pretty narrow and bounded on each ſide with ſteep Banks, as high as the Floods uſe to riſe, and but very little higher. For at High-water, and on a Spring-tide, the Water is almoſt, or altogether even with the Land.</p>
                  <p>The Lagune at the Mouth of the Rivers is but ſmall, neither is there any other way for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to force it ſelf into, beſide the Lagune and Rivers; and therefore the Tides do riſe and fall here 18 or 20 Foot.</p>
                  <p>The River of <hi>Guiaquil,</hi> in this reſpect, is much the ſame with the Gulph of <hi>St. Michael;</hi> but the Lagunes near it are larger. Here the Tides riſes and fall 16 Foot perpendicular.</p>
                  <p>I don't know of any other ſuch Places in all the South Seas; yet there are other large Rivers on the Coaſt, between theſe Places; but none ſo remarkable for high Tides. The great Tides in the Gulph of <hi>St. Michael</hi> have doubtleſs been the occaſion of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which ſome hold, that there's a ſubterranean Communication between the North and the South Seas; and that the Iſthmus of <hi>Darien</hi> is like an Arched Bridge, under which the Tides make their conſtant Courſes, as duly as they do under <hi>London-Bridge.</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0799400300:427"/>
And more to confirm this Opinion ſome have ſaid, that there are continual and ſtrange Noiſes made by thoſe Subterranean Fluxes and Refluxes; and that they are heard by the Inhabitants of the Iſthmus; and alſo that Ships ſailing in the Bay of <hi>Panama</hi> are toſs'd to and fro at a prodigious rate: Sometimes (ſay they) they are by the boiling of the Water, daſh'd againſt Iſlands; and in a moment left dry there, or ſtaved in pieces; at other times they are drawn or ſuck'd up, as 'twere, in a Whirl-pool, and ready to be carried under Ground into the North Seas, with all Sails ſtanding. They have ſaid alſo, that when the Tide flows, eſpecially on a Spring, the Iſlands in the Bay are all over-flown; nay, and even the Country for a great way together: and then nothing is to be ſeen but the tops of Trees. But if this were ſo, 'tis much that I, and thoſe that I was with, ſhould not have heard or ſeen ſomething of it: For I paſs'd the Iſthmus twice, and was 23 Days in the laſt Trip that I made over it; but yet did I never hear of any Noiſes under Ground there. I ſailed alſo in the South Seas (taking in both times that I was there) near 3 Years: and ſeveral Months of it I was in the Bay of <hi>Panama.</hi> And after I went away, thoſe of our Crew, that remained there, ſpent a great deal more time in that Bay. Yet did they never meet with ſuch ſtrange Whirl-Pools, but found as pleaſant ſailing there, as any where in the World. Neither did I ever hear any of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Indians</hi> make mention of any ſuch thing in all my Converſe with them; which certainly they would have done, if they had ever experienced it, had it been only to terrifie us, and ſcare us away from their Coaſts.</p>
                  <p>I remember indeed our Country-man Mr. <hi>Gage,</hi> gives ſome hints of theſe ſtrange Currents in this Bay, in his Book, called, <hi>A New Survey of the</hi> Weſt-Indies, from <hi>p.</hi> 538 to 440. but I am afraid he took
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0799400300:428"/>
moſt of it upon truſt from others; or elſe he was Sea-ſick all that little Voyage: for he gives a very imperfect and lame Account of that Buſineſs, as if he underſtood not what he wrote. I ſhould diſlike his whole Book for that one ſtories ſake, if I did not know that he has writ candidly upon other Matters; but I think I have ſaid enough of this. To proceed then.</p>
                  <p>As to the great Tides, which are reported to be in theſe Seas, I have given inſtances of them, but they are not ſo great as is reported; neither do they ebb and flow ſo much any where as in the Gulph of <hi>St. Michael</hi> only: where indeed they flow over thoſe ſmall low Mangrove Iſlands, at the Mouth of the Lagune, and leave only the tops of the low Trees above Water, for thoſe Iſlands are very low, neither do they afford any high Trees. But however, the Iſlands at the Mouth of the Gulph, before you come to theſe low ones, are near over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown; yet are they very ſmall and low, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with other Iſlands in the Bay of <hi>Panama.</hi> And indeed, ſhould the Iſlands in that Bay be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown, the City of <hi>Panama</hi> would ſoon be many Yards under Water. But ſo far is this from being true, that the <hi>Pearl Iſlands,</hi> which are very flat and low, are yet never overflown. For there the Tide riſeth and falls not above 10 or 11 Foot on a Spring, at the Southermoſt end of them, which is almoſt oppoſite to the Gulph of <hi>St. Michael,</hi> and not above 12 or 14 Leagues diſtant from it. And yet there it flows more than it does at or near <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> or any other Place in the Bay (except juſt at the Mouths of Rivers) by 2 or 3 Foot. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that report is wholly groundleſs.</p>
                  <p>But to go on.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo obſerved, that Iſlands lying afar off at Sea, have ſeldom ſuch high Tides as thoſe that are near the Main, or as any Places on the Main it ſelf;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0799400300:429"/>
as for example, at the <hi>Gallapagos Iſlands,</hi> which lie about 100 Leagues from the Main; the Tides don't riſe and fall above a Foot and half, or two Foot, which is leſs than they do on the Coaſt of the Main. For on moſt places of the Main it riſes and falls 2 or 3 Foot, more or leſs, according as the Coaſt is more or leſs expoſed to Indraughts or Rivers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Guam,</hi> one of the <hi>Ladrone</hi> Iſlands, is alſo another inſtance of this. There the Tide riſeth not above 2 or 3 Foot at moſt. In the Bay of <hi>Panama</hi> the Tides do keep a more conſtant and regular Courſe than on other places on the Coaſts of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico;</hi> it was for that reaſon I called them Currents in ſome places (mentioned in my <hi>Voyage round the World,</hi> as particularly near <hi>Guatuloa,</hi> on the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Continent,</hi> in Chap. IX. Page 238.) but it was truly a Tide (which there I called a Current) and it ſets to the Eaſtward as the Ebb doth to the Weſt. The Tides there do riſe and fall about 5 Foot, as they do on moſt parts of that Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Ria Leja</hi> they riſe and fall about 8 or 9 Foot.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Amapala</hi> they alſo riſe and fall about 8 or 9 Foot, and the Flood there runs to the Eaſt, and the Ebb to the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>In the Gulph of <hi>Dulce</hi> and <hi>Neicoya</hi> River, they riſe to 10 or 11 Foot; but on the Coaſt of <hi>Peru</hi> they don't riſe ſo high, eſpecially on all the Coaſt between Cape <hi>St. Francis</hi> and the River <hi>Guiaquil;</hi> there the Flood runs to the South, and the Ebb to the North.</p>
                  <p>At the Iſland <hi>Plata</hi> the Tide riſes and falls 3 or 4 Foot; but from Cape <hi>Blanco,</hi> in about 3 d. South, to 30 d. South, the Tides are ſmaller; there they riſe and fall not above a Foot and a half, or 2 Foot. The Flood on this Coaſt ſets to the South, and the Ebb to the North.</p>

                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0799400300:430"/>
In all my Cruiſings among the Privateers, I took notice of the riſings of the Tides; becauſe by knowing it, I always knew where we might beſt hall aſhore and clean our ſhips: which is alſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved by all Privateers.</p>
                  <p>In moſt Places of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Tide flows but little over what it does in our Channel.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> alſo the Tides are but ſmall on moſt Coaſts, neither are they ſo regular as with us.</p>
                  <p>The moſt irregular Tides that I did ever meet with, are at <hi>Tonqueen</hi> in about 20d. North Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and on the Coaſt of <hi>New Holland,</hi> in about 17d. South. In both theſe places, the neap Tides are ſcarce diſcernable. Thoſe of <hi>Tonqueen</hi> are deſcribed at large by Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> who was imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Page 471.) yet in that Spring that we deſigned to hall off, in order to be gone from thence, we did all take more particular notice of it than in the preceding Springs; for many had not taken notice of it before: And therefore the Major part of the Company, ſuppoſing that it was a miſtake in us who made thoſe former Obſervations, expected to hall off the Ship the third Tide after the Change; but our Ship did not float then, nor the next Tide neither, which put them all into an amazement, and a great Conſternation too: For many thought we ſhould never have got her off at all, but by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging away the Sand; and ſo clearing a Paſſage for her into the Sea. But the ſixth Tide cleared all thoſe doubts; for the Tide then roſe ſo high, as to float her quite up; when being all of us ready to work we hall'd her off; and yet the next Tide was higher than that, by which we were now all throughly ſatisfied, that the Tides here do not keep the ſame time as they do in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I muſt alſo obſerve, That here was no River, nor Lagune, nor any other Indraught on the Land near us, that might occaſion theſe great Tides; tho' 'tis very probable that the great Bending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>New Holland</hi> and <hi>New Guinea,</hi> may have both Rivers and Lagunes, which may cauſe theſe great Tides; or elſe there may be a Paſſage of the Sea between both Places; as it is laid down in ſome Draughts: Or if neither of theſe, there may be at leaſt a large and deep Sound.</p>
                  <p>This is the more probable, becauſe of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Flood that ſets to the Eaſt-ward in all that Sea, between <hi>New Holland,</hi> and the Iſlands lying North of it, which we moſt ſenſibly perceived, when we were near <hi>New Holland:</hi> And ſuch a Tide as this muſt of neceſſity have a greater Indraught than barely a River or Lagune; and 'tis the more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0799400300:434"/>
likely ſtill, that this Tide ſhould have a Paſſage through between <hi>New Holland</hi> and <hi>New Guinea,</hi> or at leaſt a deep Sound there; becauſe it keeps along by the Main, and doth not run in among the Iſlands to the North of it. And beſides, the Northermoſt Promontory of <hi>New Holland</hi> ſhoots down almoſt to the Line, which ſeems to be a Barrier to it on that ſide; therefore it may in reaſon be ſuppoſed to have its Paſſage ſome other way; but of this gueſs, I have ſaid enough.</p>
                  <p>In the Streights of <hi>Malacca</hi> the Flood ſets to the Eaſt, and the Ebb to the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>I have found the Tides at <hi>Malacca</hi> Town, to riſe and fall about ſix Foot on a Spring. I had the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of two Spring-Tides, when I was Captain <hi>Minchins</hi> Mate, as is before-mentioned in my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from <hi>Achin</hi> to <hi>Malacca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Eaſt ſide of the African Coaſt, between the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> and the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> the Tide keeps its conſtant Courſe. The Flood runs to the Southward; the Ebb to the North-ward. And at a Spring-tide in the Rivers on that Coaſt, the Tide riſes and falls ſix Foot, eſpecially in the River of <hi>Natal,</hi> in Lat. 30 d. South.</p>
                  <p>I have this Relation from Capt. <hi>Rogers,</hi> who is a very Ingenious Perſon, and well experienced on that Coaſt; and is now gone Commander of a ſmall Veſſel thither to Trade.</p>
                  <p>Having already largely treated of Tides, I come now to ſpeak ſomewhat of Currents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0799400300:435"/>
CUrrents and Tides differ many ways; for Tides run forward, and back again, twice every 24 Hours: on the contrary Currents run a Day, a VVeek, nay, ſometimes more, one way: and then, it may be, run another way.</p>
                  <p>In ſome particular Places they run ſix Months one way, and ſix Months another.</p>
                  <p>In other Places they conſtantly run one way on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a day or two, about full Moon, and then they run ſtrong againſt the former Courſe; and after that, return the ſame way again:</p>
                  <p>In ſome Places they run conſtantly one way, and never ſhift at all.</p>
                  <p>The force of Tides is generally felt near the ſhore; whereas Currents are at a remote diſtance; neither are the Effects of them ſenſibly diſcerned by the riſing or falling away of the VVater as thoſe of the Tides are; for theſe commonly ſet along ſhore.</p>
                  <p>'Tis generally obſerved by Seamen, that in all Places where Trade-winds blow, the Current is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by them, and moves the ſame way with the VVinds; but 'tis not with a like ſwiftneſs in all Places; neither is it always ſo diſcernable by us in the wide Ocean, as it is near to ſome Coaſt; and yet it is not ſo diſcernable neither, very near any Coaſt, except at Capes and Promontories, that ſhoot far forth out into the Sea; and about Iſlands alſo the Effects of them are felt more or leſs, as they lye in the way of the Trade-Winds.</p>

The greater Iſlands as <hi>Hiſpaniola, Jamaica</hi> and <hi>Cuba</hi> have only ſome particular Capes or Head-Lands, expoſed to Currents, as Cape <hi>Tiberoon</hi> on <hi>Hiſpaniola, Point Pedro,</hi> and the N. E. Point of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Cape de Cruz, Cape Corientes,</hi> and <hi>Cape Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios</hi> on <hi>Cuba:</hi> But of all the Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> there are none more ſenſible of Currents than <hi>Corriſao</hi> and <hi>Aruba,</hi> nor any Capes on the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſo remarkable for Currents as <hi>Cape Roman,</hi> which ſhoots out againſt the Sea, between thoſe two Places, as alſo <hi>Cape Coquibaco</hi> and <hi>Cape La Vela</hi> to Leeward, all three on the ſame Head-Land, which ſhoots forth far, without any other Land on the Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſuch Head-Land till you come to <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios,</hi> which is about 260 Leagues to Leeward. Indeed to the Eaſtward there is Land that trends out almoſt ſo far, within 150 Leagues of it: <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The Iſland <hi>Trinidado</hi> and the Land againſt it; and there alſo are great Currents. But I ſhall firſt ſpeak of the Currents between <hi>Cape La Vela</hi> and <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Currents at <hi>Cape La Vela</hi> do ſeldom ſhift, therefore Ships that ply to Wind-ward to get about it, do not ply near the ſhore, but ſtand off to Sea, till they come in ſight of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and then back again, till within about 6 or 8 Leagues of the Cape, but not nearer. But in the Weſterly Wind-Seaſon, which is from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>March,</hi> Ships of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meet Weſterly Winds that laſt two or three Days with which they may run to the Eaſtward, without any trouble.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Cape La Vela</hi> and <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios,</hi> the Currents are much different from what they are againſt the Cape: and this ſeems to proceed from the make of the Land; for the ſhore between the

                  <p>Here, in the Weſterly Wind-Seaſon, the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſets to the Weſtward conſtantly; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtronger than at other times. At about four Leagues off ſhore, you find it, and ſo it continues till you are 20,—25,—or 30 Leagues off. Beyond that you meet with an Eaſterly Wind; and if there is any Current it runs alſo to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: therefore Ships that are bound to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, muſt run off to Sea Thirty or Forty Leagues to get a Wind, or elſe if they have but a little way to go, they muſt ply cloſe under the ſhore, that ſo they may Anchor when they pleaſe: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they will be carried away to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Fourteen or Sixteen Leagues in a Nights time; and that too, tho' they have a faint Eaſterly Wind, as frequently they meet with, tho' 'tis the Weſterly Wind-Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>To the Eaſt of <hi>Cape Roman,</hi> as high as the Iſland <hi>Trinidado,</hi> you meet only a ſoaking faint Current, ſetting to the Weſtward, except only near ſuch places as ſhoot out fartheſt into the Sea, as about the <hi>Teſtegos,</hi> which are ſmall Iſlands lying to Wind-ward of the Iſland <hi>Margarita.</hi> Between thoſe Iſlands and the Main, you meet with a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrong Current: therefore it is hard getting to the Eaſt-ward there; but on all the Coaſt, between <hi>Cape Roman</hi> and the Head-Land, ſhooting out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Teſtegos,</hi> you may ply up with the Land and Sea-Breezes.</p>
                  <p>From thence, till you come as high as the Eaſt-end of <hi>Trinidado Iſle,</hi> you meet with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrong Current.</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0799400300:438"/>
From the Eaſt-end of <hi>Trinidado,</hi> till you come to <hi>Surinam,</hi> though you meet an Eaſterly Current, yet 'tis poſſible to beat it up with the Land and Sea-Breezes.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Surinam</hi> alſo to <hi>Cape Blanco,</hi> you may turn it up, though to be ſure you'll meet with Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſetting to the Weſt; except near the Full of the Moon; and then on all the Coaſts before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, we commonly meet with Currents, ſetting to the Eaſtward; at leaſt then it ſlackens and ſtands ſtill, if it doth not run to the Eaſt-ward. But when you are come as far to the Eaſt as <hi>Cape Blanco,</hi> on the North of <hi>Brazil,</hi> you meet with a Current always againſt you; and ſo from thence Southerly, as far as Cape <hi>St. Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no dealing with this Promontory; for it ſhoots out ſo far into the Sea, and thereby lies ſo expoſed to the Sea-Breezes and the Currents, that ſoak down between <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Brazil,</hi> that it is quite contrary to reaſon to think there ſhould not always be a ſtrong Current ſetting to the N. W</p>
                  <p>I have before hinted, That in all Places where the Trade blows, we find a Current ſetting with the Wind, which is not ſo perceptible in the wide Sea as nearer the Shores; yet even there the force of the Winds conſtantly blowing one way, may, and probably does, move the ſurface of the Water along with it.</p>
                  <p>From hence it may be inferred, that the Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Winds on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the true Trade between it and <hi>Brazil,</hi> gently move the ſurface of the Sea with it, and the Trade being moſtly at S. E. drives the Sea to the Northward, ſlanting in on the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil;</hi> which being there ſtopp'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0799400300:439"/>
by the Land, bends its Courſe Northerly toward <hi>Cape St. Auguſtine:</hi> And after it has doubled that great Promontory, it falls away more gently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Coaſt of <hi>Surinam;</hi> and from thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>VVeſt-Indies.</hi> For after it has doubled that Promontory, it has more room to ſpread it ſelf, and thereby becomes weaker in motion, being agitated by the Trade-winds, which to the North of the Line, we find commonly blowing at E. N. E and this ſtill bears the Sea ſlanting down along the Coaſt to the Weſtward. And probably 'tis for this reaſon, that we find the Current ſetting ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt near thoſe Head-Lands before-mentioned. Whereas at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and other of the Caribbee Iſlands, we find only a ſoaking Current, ſuch as ſeems to ariſe only from the conſtancy of the Trade-winds blowing there, and not from an original Current, from the South part of the Atlantick: which, as I ſaid before, doubles about <hi>Cape St. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and ſo Coaſts along pretty nigh the ſhore.</p>
                  <p>The Currents about the Iſland <hi>Trinidado,</hi> and at <hi>Curriſao</hi> and <hi>Aruba,</hi> as alſo between them and <hi>Cape Roman</hi> ſeem to indicate as much. The Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents alſo between <hi>Cape Roman,</hi> and <hi>Cape La Vela</hi> indicate the ſame.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cape La Vela</hi> the Currents ſet ſtill to the Weſtward, towards <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios;</hi> but in a direct Line, and not borrowing or ſlanting in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhore. For, as I ſaid before, it is a large Bay, and Currents commonly ſet from one Head-Land to another; ſo that Bays have ſeldom any; or if they have, they are only Counter Currents. And theſe Counter Currents too do ſet from one Point to another, without interfering with the little Bays between. And 'tis alſo very probable that theſe Counter Currents, ſuchas we meet with in this Bay,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0799400300:440"/>
in their Seaſons, after they have ſurrounded the Bay, and are got as far to the Eaſt as <hi>Cape La Vela,</hi> wheel off there, and turn about again with the Stream to the Weſtward, like an Eddy in a River.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Cape Gratia de Dios</hi> the Current ſets away N. W. towards <hi>Cape Catoch,</hi> and ſo paſſes away to the Northward, between Cape <hi>Catoch</hi> on <hi>Jucatan,</hi> and Cape <hi>Antonio</hi> on <hi>Cuba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Channel between thoſe two Capes, we commonly find a ſtrong Current ſetting to the Northward: And here I have found them extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>On the North ſide of <hi>Jucatan,</hi> as you paſs into the Bay of <hi>Campeachy,</hi> you meet with a ſmall ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Current to the Weſtward, even down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Bay of <hi>Mexico;</hi> but on the North ſide of the Bay of <hi>Mexico</hi> the Current ſets to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And 'tis probable that is the reaſon, that the Spaniards, coming from <hi>La Vera Cruz,</hi> keep that ſhore aboard. And 'tis as probable that the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which ſets to Leeward, on all the Coaſt from Cape <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> to Cape <hi>Catoch,</hi> never enters the Bay of <hi>Mexico;</hi> but bends ſtill to the Northward, till 'tis check'd by the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore; and then wheels about to the Eaſt, till it comes nearer the Gulphs Mouth, and there joyning with the ſoaking Current that draws down on the North ſides of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> and <hi>Cuba,</hi> paſſes altogether with great ſtrength through the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> which is the moſt remarkable Gulph in the World for its Currents; becauſe it always ſets very ſtrong to the North. Yet near the ſhores on each ſide this Gulph, there are Tides, eſpecially on the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore; and Ships may paſs which way they pleaſe, if they are acquainted.</p>
                  <p>It has formerly been accounted very dangerous to meet with a North in this Gulph; and for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Then beſides, if a North take a Ship in the Gulph, the Wind blowing againſt the Current makes an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sea, and ſo thick come the Waves one after another that a ſhip can't poſſibly live in it; yet of late they go through at all times of the Year, and if a North takes them in the Gulph, they put a way right before the Wind and Sea, with a ſmall Head-Sail; yet the Current is then as ſtrong or ſtronger then at other times; and forces them back, ſtern foremoſt againſt both Wind and Sea: For tho' the ſurface of the Sea is raiſed in Waves and driven violently with the Winds to the Southward, yet the Current under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath runs ſtill to the Northward; neither is it any ſtrange thing to ſee two different Currents at one place and time, the ſuperficial Water running one way, and that underneath running a quite contrary: For ſometimes at an Anchor, I have ſeen the Cable carryed thus by two different Streams, the under part having been doubled one way, and the upper part the contrary.

Within 5 Leagues off the ſhore you have the Tide, and not a Current; and being paſt 50 Leagues off ſhore, the Current either ceaſeth quite, or is imperceptible.</p>
                  <p>On the Coaſt of <hi>India,</hi> North of the Line, the Current ſets with the Monſoon, but does not ſhift altogether ſo ſoon, ſometimes not by 3 Weeks or more, and then never ſhifts again till after the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon is ſettled in the contrary way.

                  <p>It would be a moſt ridiculous thing for a Man here to be ſeen without a Tallow Cap. But Boys are not ſuffered to wear any, till they come to Maturity; and then they begin to build upon their Heads. The Women have only ſhort Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats which reach from the Waſte to the Knee. When it Rains they cover their Bodies with a ſimple Cows-hide, thrown over their Shoulders like a Blanket.</p>

                  <p>When they are thus attired, their Heads a little intoxicated and the Muſick playing they'll skip about merrily, and ſhake their Tails to ſome purpoſe; but are very innocent in their Mirth.</p>
                  <p>Every Man may have as many Wives as he can purchaſe and maintain: And without buying here are none to be had; neither is there any other Commodity to be bought or ſold but Women.</p>
