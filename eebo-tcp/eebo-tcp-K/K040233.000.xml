            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Father of the following little Offspring, being very well convinc'd of the natural Weakneſs of this his puny Child, did never intend to truſt it abroad without the <hi>LEADING STRINGS</hi> of <hi>Action;</hi> had not the Fear of thoſe, who, like Cowards, are afraid of their own Shadows, aſſiduouſly oppos'd the Repreſentation; being terribly apprehenſive that the Strength of a poor Baby <hi>Monoſyllable</hi> might affect the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of a <hi>Drawcanſir.</hi>—Such is the Force of Self-Conviction!—But as this Infant is oblig'd to walk alone, by many who are reſolv'd on it's Appearance, it's Father moſt humbly deſires the good-natur'd Town will not tumble the little Creature into the Dirt; but that they will help it forward over the Kennels of Detraction; and, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Tenderneſs of it's Age, keep the barking Curs, the Critics, at a Diſtance.— And to excite them to this Benevolence, here
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0601100300:4"/>
follow the Memoirs of the cruel and affecting Period of its Birth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Piece of <hi>Fun,</hi> Son to the Father, and Grandſon to the Grandfather of the ſame Name, was conceiv'd, in a Fit of Laughter, about the 8th of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year 1752. —His Mother advanc'd happily in her Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, and there were great Hopes of a fine Offspring; but, unhappily, juſt before the Time of her Delivery, Meaſures were taken, by a certain great Man, to make her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; excited, as ſome ſay, to this Piece of Barbarity, by an old Woman's Propheſy which he keeps by him (caſt in <hi>leaden</hi> Characters) in a Cheſt of <hi>Braſs</hi> ſecured, like the <hi>fortunate Tickets</hi> of a Lottery, by <hi>ſeven Locks:</hi> And of which Propheſy the following is a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript:</p>
            <q>
               <l>When <hi>Fun</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Has a Son</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Drawcanſir</hi>'s Race is run.</l>
            </q>
            <p>However childiſh and ridiculous it may ſeem for a Man to be affected with ſuch idle Stuff as this, it is not unprecedented or extravagantly ſtrange; ſince Tradition tells us, that <hi>Saturn,</hi> Father of <hi>JUPITER,</hi> the Great Grandfather of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and many other auguſt Perſonages, were equally mov'd, by ſuch Inſtigations, to much the ſame Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0601100300:5"/>Notwithſtanding, however, all ſuch malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Meaſures were taken, the full Time of Pregnancy advanc'd, and the Child was hourly expected; when a <hi>poſitive Order</hi> came down, that <hi>Mrs. FUN,</hi> who then lay at the <hi>Caſtle-Tavern, Pater-noſter-Row,</hi> muſt not be brought to-bed within the Walls, leſt the Child, which was ſuſpected to be a Baſtard, ſhould bring a Scandal on the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity</hi> of the City. Upon this, even while the Lady lay crying out, the Father waited on the chief Perſonage of the <hi>Liberties,</hi> with Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Child was very honeſtly got, and that none but very creditable People were at the Labour; complaining, at the ſame Time, that the ſame Privilege had been permitted an <hi>old Woman</hi> of <hi>a very bad Character,</hi> one <hi>Mother Midnight,</hi> who had often practis'd her Profeſſion there, tho' it was now denied others. —'Twas all in vain: The Gentleman, though he behav'd with a great deal of Politeneſs and Good-manners, was ſo prepoſſeſs'd againſt the whole Family of <hi>FUN,</hi> which had been falſely repreſented to him as of no Character or Reputation, that he not only forbid the Men Midwives doing their Duty, but ſent others to ſee his Orders duly executed.—What could now be done?—<hi>Mrs. FUN</hi> was, in the midſt of her Travail, remov'd; and, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body daring to give her Aſſiſtance, her poor Offspring almoſt periſhed in the Birth. But
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0601100300:6"/>
Nature had been liberal, the <hi>Stamina</hi> were ſound, and branched out for Life. 'Tis true, indeed, its Features were ſo defac'd, that the ſtrong <hi>Likeneſs</hi> in them was almoſt loſt; and a Weakneſs, which will be laſting as it's Life, is the Conſequence of the Uſage it then met with.—If, after all, then, it ſhould fail of anſwering thoſe Expectations the Town had of it, in Embrio; it will undoubtedly be thought, there is Reaſon enough to excuſe all the Imperfections and Failings it is unhappily afflicted with; ſince theſe are ſo far from being its Faults, that they are Misfortunes which muſt infallibly engage the Protection of every candid, tender-hearted, <hi>chriſtian</hi> Reader!</p>

            <l>Whoſe <hi>Self</hi> I am?—And for your Information,</l>
            <l>Hear my Birth, Parentage and Education:</l>
            <l>My Sire was, thirty Years ago, in Vogue;</l>
            <l>His Name was <hi>WIT,</hi> an arch, diverting Rogue;</l>
            <l>My Mother's Name was <hi>HUMOUR,</hi> low and poor,</l>
            <l>Reduc'd for Want ſometimes to play the Whore.</l>
            <l>Who beſt repaid what ſhe was pleas'd to grant,</l>
            <l>Was <hi>RIBALDRY,</hi> her favourite Gallant.</l>
            <l>Now, little Delicacy dwelt in either,</l>
            <l>For, as I'm told, they <hi>all Three</hi> lay together.</l>
