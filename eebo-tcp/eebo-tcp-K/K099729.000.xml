            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Homer</hi> uſed the

<hi>Virgil,</hi> from <hi>Ennius,</hi> in his HEROICKS, render'd his

and our contemporary <hi>Paſtoral Writers,</hi> by
reviving the antiquated <hi>Engliſh</hi> terms, by chuſing
and culling the fineſt Words of our Glorious AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESTORS.
In the Steps of theſe, our Swain has
ventur'd to tread; and where the Phraſe in uſe
was not ſuited to the ſoftneſs and ſimplicity of
his CHARACTERS, as he is acquainted with the
Dialect of moſt Counties in <hi>England,</hi> has from
thence drawn the tendereſt Expreſſions, as he
thought, and beſt adapted to the ſimplicity of his
ſentiments. Induced, I ſuppoſe, to take theſe
Liberties in Paſtoral, by what that excellent
Judge of Poetry Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> has laid down on
that Poem. How beautiful, ſays he, is the old
Paſtoral BALLAD, beginning thus,

And into Language how much finer than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's,
has he turn'd a Thought of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0118704400:4"/>

                  <l>Where twelve gay Signs in meet array are ſeen.</l>
               </q>
This great Man adds, that by imitating the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity
of the <hi>Dorick,</hi> by the help of the old obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete
<hi>Roman</hi> Language, <hi>Virgil</hi> might have attain'd
as much of the Air of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> as <hi>Phillips</hi> hath
that of <hi>Spencer,</hi> by uſing the antiquated ENGLISH.</p>
            <p>Fewer Old-words, indeed, has our preſent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the incomparable <hi>Paſtorals</hi> of Mr: <hi>Phillips</hi>: But in
return, has often made uſe of thoſe once introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
As his CHARACTERS are particularly ſimple
and tender, much alſo has he imitated <hi>Spencer</hi>'s
manner, of changing the vulgar dreſs, as 'twere,
of his Words, yet leaving the Main Body ſo as to
be known. <hi>Homer</hi>'s manner of performing this
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhows in the 21 Chap. of his <hi>Poeſie</hi>:

               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. Virgil</hi> did it, by changing
ILLI into OLLI, and the like. <hi>Milton</hi> by altering
HERMIT into EREMITE; ENTERPRIZE into EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIZE,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Spencer</hi> by affixing <hi>y</hi> and <hi>a</hi> before,

               <pb facs="tcp:0118704400:5"/>
This Liberty every good heroick Writer has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
And well knew <hi>Spencer,</hi> that Paſtoral ſtill
more required it. He has given us, in his <hi>Fairy-Queen,</hi>
a new Language: The reaſon muſt be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Scene lyes in a new Place. But how
much more has he done it in his Paſtorals.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Among other places, in the Preface to her <hi>HOMER.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>D'acier,</hi> and many Frenchmen, complain of
the penury and ſtiffneſs of their Language, thro'
the want of this. And Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> obſerves, that
the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did the like. Yet muſt I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that even among the Paſtoral Writers, no
one but <hi>Theocritus, Spencer,</hi> and our preſent <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Swains, durſt ever venture themſelves in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Path,
being affraid and unwilling to forgo
that Honour which either a refin'd Language or
a ſublime one procures: But then muſt we add,
that from thence it is, that no Critick, but who
dares not ſtir a ſtep without Leading-ſtrings, as
<hi>Scaliger, Rapin,</hi> &amp;c, has ever allow'd any elſe to
be Paſtoral Writers.</p>
            <p>But is any One diſſatisfied with our rural STILE,
read he a full Vindication of one much more ſo:
ſuch he'll find before <note n="†" place="bottom">Folio Edition.</note> 
               <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Paſtorals; and
by his Friend Mr. <hi>Harvey.</hi> For who knows not,
<pb facs="tcp:0118704400:6"/>
that his Language was equally uncommon in his
Day, and in <hi>Our</hi>'s; Our TONGUE receiving no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Alteration in one hundred Years. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Ben. Johnſon, Hooker, Our Common-Prayer Book,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Reader will obſerve I here only bring ſome
few <hi>Authorities</hi>; The reaſon that I my ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
laying down any thing concerning the true
Paſtoral Language is, becauſe we ſhall ſee, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
a Diſcourſe in a ſhort time on the Nature
of this kind of Poetry. Where that TENDER in
the Language, which is agreeable to Paſtoral, will
be conſidered; and diſtinguiſh'd from the TENDER
which is ſuitable to the Epick, and that which the
Tragick Poem requires.</p>
            <p>Conclude we then with what the Learned <hi>Baſil
Kennet</hi> ſays, in his Life of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> after
ſpeaking of his ruſtick Stile. <hi>As for our ſelves,</hi>
