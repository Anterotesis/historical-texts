            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE following Comedy is formed on a plan of Monſieur de Fontenelle's, never intended for the ſtage, and printed in the eighth volume of his works, under the title of Le Teſtament.</p>
            <p>The ſcene of that piece is laid in Greece, and the embarraſſing circumſtances depend on ſome peculiarities in the cuſtoms of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Slaves likewiſe, as is uſual in the Grecian Comedy, act as confidantes to the principal perſonages. The Author, therefore, hopes he may be excuſed for having made the ſtory Engliſh, and his own; for having introduced a new character, and endeavoured to heighten thoſe he found already ſketched out. The delicacy of the ſentiments in Philonoe and Eudamidas, he has inviolably adhered to, wherever he could inſert them properly, in his Caelia and Sir John Dorilant; and would willingly flatter himſelf, that he has made great and not contemptible additions to their characters, as well as to the others.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who will give themſelves the trouble to read both pieces, will ſee where the Author is, or is not indebted to that elegant French Writer.</p>

                  <p>Girls are not quite ſo ignorant as you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, Mr. Modely; Caelia will underſtand you, take my word for it, and does underſtand you. As to your men of judgment and ſenſe, here is my brother now; I take him to be full as reaſonable as yourſelf, and ſomewhat older; and yet with all his philoſophy, he has brought himſelf to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination at laſt, to fulfill the father's will, and marry this green girl. I am ſorry to tell you ſo, Mr. Modely, but he will certainly marry her.</p>

                  <p>Let him marry her. I ſhould perhaps do it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if I was in his place. He was an intimate friend of her father's. She is a great fortune, and was given to him by will. But do you imagine, my dear Araminta, that if he was left to his own choice, without any bias, he would not rather have a woman nearer his own years? He might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt be her father.</p>

                  <p>That is true. But you will find it difficult to perſuade me, that youth in a woman is ſo inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable an objection. I fancy, Mr. Modely, it may be got over. Suppoſe I leave you to think of it.—(I cannot get this right.)—

                  <p>That ſhews your ignorance; I am ten years younger than he is. My dreſs and the company I keep, give a youth and vivacity to me, which he muſt always want. An't I a man of the town? O that town, Belmour! Could I but have met theſe ladies there, I had done the buſineſs.</p>

                  <p>Never.—Sir Harry Beverley, the father of this girl, lived always in the country, and divided his time between his books and his hounds.

                  <p>No, no!—She has a deviliſh deal of that kind of ſenſe, which is acquired by early reading. I have heard her talk occaſionally, like a queen in a tragedy, or at leaſt like a ſentimental lady in a comedy,

                  <p>Yes, yes, I have read her.

                  <p>Why that is ſomewhat ſurprizing. But the truth of the caſe was, they were thoroughly acquainted, and each conſidered party as the foible of the other.

Here, here, ſit down, and tell me plainly and honeſtly without equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reſervation, is Modely indifferent to you? Nay, nay,—look me in the face; turn your eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. One judges greatly by the eyes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a woman. Your poor papa uſed to ſay that my eyes reaſoned better than my tongue. — Well, and now tell me without bluſhing, is Modely indifferent to you?</p>

Lard! I remember when your poor papa —he, he, he— but we have no time for old ſtories.

                  <p>PRITHEE don't teize me ſo; I vow, couſin Modely, you are almoſt as peremptory as my daughter. She truly was teaching me decorum juſt now, and plaguing me with her delicacies, and her ſtuff. I tell you Sir John will be in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den immediately, this is always his hour of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and when he comes, I ſhall lay the whole affair before him, with all its concatenation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and I warrant you bring it about.</p>

                  <p>I have no doubt, madam, of the tranſcendency of your ladyſhip's rhetorick; it is on that I entirely rely. But I muſt beg leave to hint, that Araminta already ſuſpects my paſſion, and ſhould it be openly declared, would undoubtedly prevail that inſtant with her brother to forbid me the houſe.</p>

the world, muſt ſee the neceſſity of concealing it, at leaſt for a time. I beg pardon for offering what may have even the diſtant appearance of inſtruction. But it is Sir John's delicacy which muſt be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally alarmed with apprehenſions of her diſregard for him; and I am ſure your ladyſhip's manner of doing it, will ſhew him where he might much better place his affections, and with an undoubted proſpect of happineſs.</p>

                  <p>My dear, dear brother, you are enough to ſpoil any woman in the univerſe. I tell you again and again, the girl is a good girl, an excellent girl, and will make an admirable wife. You may truſt one woman in her commendations of another; we are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0152602800:29"/>
not apt to be too favourable in our judgments, eſpecially when there is beauty in the caſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SIR JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>You charm me when you talk thus. If ſhe is really all this, how happy muſt the man be who can engage her affections. But alas! Araminta, in every thing which regards me, it is duty, not love, which actuates her behaviour. She ſteals away my very ſoul by her attentions, but never once expreſſes that heart-felt tenderneſs, thoſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic feelings.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
                  <p>Ha—ha — ha!—O my ſtars!— Sympathetic feelings!—Why, would you have a girl of her age have thoſe ſympathetic feelings, as you call them! If ſhe had, take my word for it, ſhe would coquet it with half the fellows in town before ſhe had been married a twelvemonth. Beſides, Sir John, you don't conſider that you was her father's friend; ſhe has been accuſtomed from her infancy to reſpect you in that light; and our fathers friends, you know, are always old people, grey beards, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, enemies to youth, and the deſtruction of gayety.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SIR JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>But I was never ſuch.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
                  <p>You may imagine ſo; but you always had a grave turn. I hated you once myſelf.</p>

to-night.—But let that paſs: As the caſe now ſtands, if I was not already ſo near akin to you, you have the temper in the world which I ſhould chuſe in a huſband.</p>

                  <speaker>SIR JOHN</speaker>
                  <p>That is obliging, however.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
                  <p>Not ſo very obliging perhaps neither. It would be merely for my own ſake, for then would I have the appearance of the moſt obedient ſympathetic wife in the univerſe, and yet be as deſpotic in my govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an eaſtern monarch. And when I grew tired, as I probably ſhould do, of a want of contradiction, why, I ſhould find an eaſy remedy for that too— I could break your heart in about a month.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SIR JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't trifle with me, 'tis your ſerious advice I want; give it me honeſtly as a friend, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as a ſiſter.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
                  <p>Why I have done it, fifty times. What can I ſay more? If you will have it again you muſt. This then it is in plain terms.—But you are ſure you are heartily in love with her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, that we will take for granted; and now you want to know what is right and proper for you to do in the caſe. Why, was I in your place, I ſhould make but ſhort work with it. She knows the circumſtances of her father's will, therefore, would I go immediately to her, tell her how my heart ſtood inclined, and hope ſhe had no objections to comply, with what it is not in her power to refuſe.</p>

                  <p>You would not have me talk thus abruptly to her?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>ARAMINTA.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I would. It will ſave a world of trouble. She will bluſh perhaps at firſt, and look a little aukward, (and by the by ſo will you too); but if ſhe is the girl I take her for, after a little irreſolute geſture, and about five minutes converſation, ſhe will drop you a curteſy with the demure humility of a Veſtal, and tell you it ſhall be as you and her mama pleaſes.</p>

                  <p>Yes indeed does it. His fondneſs for her might naturally make him wiſh to place her with a perſon of your known excellence of character; for my own part, had I died, I ſhould have wiſhed it myſelf.—I don't believe you have your equal in the world.— Nay, dear Sir John, 'tis no compliment.—This I ſay might make him not attend to the impropriety of the thing, and the reluctance a gentleman of your good ſenſe and judgment muſt undoubtedly have to accede to ſo unſuitable a treaty. Eſpecially as he could not but know there were women of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world, who would be proud of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance where the proſpect of felicity, was ſo inviting and unqueſtionable.</p>

                  <p>CAELIA in love with me! Egad the thing is not impoſſible; my friend Modely may have been a little miſtaken. Sir John was very ſerious when he told me of it; and though I proteſted to him that I had never made the leaſt advances, he ſtill perſiſted in his opinion.—The girl muſt have have told him ſo herſelf.—Let me recollect a little. —She is always extremely civil to me; but that indeed ſhe is to every body.—I do not remember any thing particular in her looks; but I ſhall watch them more narrowly the next time I ſee her.—She is very handſome; and yet in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, notwithſtanding Modely's infidelity, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta is much the finer woman.—Suppoſe— No, that will not do.</p>

                  <p>Dear, dear, he never was mentioned. I muſt confeſs that I was ſo provoked with Sir John's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural behaviour, that I could not help telling him that Caelia had a lover, and in the houſe too. Your ſituation with regard to Araminta made him never dream of you, and conſequently all his ſuſpicions turned on Belmour.</p>

                  <speaker>LADY.</speaker>
                  <p>O ay, with all my heart, couſin Modely. For though I may ſay it without vanity, that nobody has a more clear apprehenſion of things when the mental faculty is totally undiſturbed; yet, when I am in a trepidation, nobody upon earth can be more glad of advice.</p>

                  <p>Thus far is certain, that Belmour diſclaims all knowledge of the affair, and with an appearance of ſincerity; but even that is doubtful.

                  <p>Well then — is your heart your own?</p>
                  <p>O Caelia, that heſitation confirms my fears. You cannot anſwer in the affirmative, and have too much humanity for what I feel, to add to my torments. —Good God! — and is it poſſible, that an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a few days, ſhould entirely obliterate the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive aſſiduity, the tender anxieties which I have ſhewn for years!—But I underſtand it all too well. Mine were the aweful, though heart-felt attentions of a parent; his, the ſprightly addreſs of a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lover. His eaſy aſſurance has won upon your affections, and what I thought <hi>my</hi> greateſt merit, has undone me.</p>

my confuſion; pity it now, and whilſt I lay my heart open before you, be again that kind, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous friend, which I have always found you.</p>

                  <p>It is in vain for me to diſſemble an ignorance of your meaning, nor would I if I could. I own I have been too much pleaſed with Mr. Modely's conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>

                  <p>Let me go on.—His intended marriage with Araminta, gave him a freedom in this family which it was not my buſineſs to reſtrain. His attentions to my mother, and the friendly manner in which he executed ſome commiſſions of conſequence to her, gave him frequent opportunities of talking to me. I will confeſs too, that his appearance and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtruck me. But I was ſo convinced of his real paſſion for Araminta, that I never dreamt of the leaſt attachment to me, till—</p>

                  <p>I know it was ſo intended, but his behaviour this morning, and the interceſſions of my mother, had, I own, won upon me ſtrangely, and induced me to believe that I only was the object of his purſuits.</p>

                  <p>She told me indeed there was a favoured lover, and my ſuſpicions fell very naturally upon Belmour. Nay, even now, nothing but that lovely ſincerity— which undoes me—could make me credit this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy of Modely.—O Caelia! what a heart have I loſt!</p>

                  <p>Marry her, my dear Araminta? Can you think it poſſible, that I ſhould have ſo prepoſterous a thought? No, my behaviour ſhall deſerve her, but not over-rule her inclinations. Were I to ſeize the tender opportunity of her preſent diſpoſition, the world would aſcribe it to her fortune; and I am ſure my deceaſed and valuable friend, however kindly he meant to me in the affair, never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I ſhould make his daughter unhappy.</p>

                  <p>Ah ſiſter, you are willing to diſpoſe of her any way. That worthleſs lover of yours ſtill hangs about your heart, and I have avoided ſeeing him on your account, as well as Caelia's.</p>

                  <p>You had better ſay nothing. Your ſpirits at preſent are too much alarmed.—I have ſent for Caelia hither, a ſhort hour may determine the fates of all of us. I know my honourable intentions will give her great uneaſineſs.

A man of your diſcretion will undoubtedly be guilty of no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. But a third perſon ſometimes, where the parties concerned are a little too much influenced by their paſſions, has occaſioned very ſubſtantial, and very uſeful effects.

                  <speaker>SIR JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>Not in the leaſt, madam, I have no blame to caſt upon you for any part of your conduct. Your youth and inexperience, joined to the goodneſs of your heart, are ſufficient apologies for any ſhadow of indiſcretion which might appear in your behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I am afraid mine was not ſo irreproachable. However, Caelia, I ſhall endeavour to make you all the amends in my power; and to ſhew you that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0152602800:66"/>
it is your happineſs, not my own, which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my anxiety.</p>
                  <p>Your father's will is but too clear in its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the purity of his heart never meant to promote my felicity at the expence of yours. You are therefore, madam, entirely at liberty from this moment, to make your choice where you pleaſe. This paper will entitle you to that authority, and this will enable you to beſtow your fortune where you beſtow your hand.—Take them, my dear! —Why are you ſo diſturbed?—Alas, Caelia, I ſee too plainly the cauſe of theſe emotions. You only wiſh the happy man to whom you have given your heart, loved you as I do!—</p>
                  <p>But I beg pardon; and will only add one cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which my duty demands of me, as your guardian, your protector, and your father's friend. —You have been a witneſs of Modely's tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with my ſiſter. Have a care therefore, Caelia; be ſure of his firm attachment before you let your own hurry you into a compliance. Theſe papers give you up all power on my part; but as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer, I ſhall be always ready to be conſulted.</p>

What friend, what lover have I, to engroſs my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? I never had but one, and he has caſt me off for ever.—O, Sir, give me the papers, and let me return them where my ſoul longs to place them.</p>

                  <p>YOU find, Mr. Belmour, that I have ſeen your partialities, and like a woman of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I have confeſſed my own. Your behaviour to your friend is generous beyond compariſon, and I could almoſt join in the little ſtratagem you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, merely to ſee if he deſerves it.</p>

                  <speaker>BELMOUR.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, madam, you miſtake him utterly. Vanity is his ruling vice; an idle affectation of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs among the ladies, which makes fools admire, and boys envy him, is the maſter paſſion of his giddy heart. The ſevere checks he has met with to-day, have ſufficiently opened his underſtanding; and the real poſſeſſion of one valuable woman, whom he dreads to loſe, will ſoon convince him how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable his folly has made him.</p>

                  <p>I am afraid, Mr. Belmour, a man who has half his life been purſuing bubbles, without perceiving their inſignificance, will be eaſily tempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0152602800:79"/>
the chace. The poſſeſſion of one reality will hardly convince him that the reſt were ſhadows. And a woman muſt be an ideot indeed, who thinks of fixing a man to herſelf after marriage, whom ſhe could not ſecure before it. To begin with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, O fie, Mr. Modely.</p>

                  <p>Is as idle as our converſation on the ſubject. I beg your pardon for the compariſon; as I do, for having ſent for you in this manner. But I thought it neceſſary that both you and Mr. Modely ſhould know my real ſentiments, undiſguiſed by paſſion.</p>

                  <p>I don't know what to ſay to it, it is a piece of mummery which I am ill ſuited for at preſent. But if an opportunity ſhould offer, I muſt confeſs I have enough of the woman in me, not to be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the charms of an innocent revenge.—But this other intricate buſineſs, if you can aſſiſt me in that, you will oblige me beyond meaſure. There are two hearts, Mr. Belmour, worthy to be united! Had my brother a little leſs honour, and ſhe a little leſs ſenſibility—But I know not what to think of it.</p>

                  <p>Honour, Mr. Modely! 'tis a ſacred word. You ought to ſhudder when you pronounce it. Honour has no exiſtence but in the breaſt of truth. 'Tis the harmonious reſult of every virtue combined. — You have ſenſe, you have knowledge; but I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, Mr. Modely, tho' parts and knowledge, without the dictates of juſtice, or the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, may make a bold and miſchievous member of ſociety even courted by the world, they only, in my eye, make him more contemptible.</p>

                  <p>You may think, perhaps, it is only an idle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair with a lady, what half mankind are guilty of, and what the conceited wits of your acquaintance will treat with raillery. Faith with a woman! ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous! —But let me tell you, Mr. Modely, the man who even ſlightly deceives a believing and a truſting woman, can never be a man of honour.</p>

                  <p>I own the truth of your aſſertions. I feel the aweful ſuperiority of your real virtue. Nor ſhould any thing have dragged me into your preſence, ſo much I dreaded it, but the ſincereſt hope of making you happy.</p>

                  <p>Believe me, Sir, 'tis more; 'tis real unaffected paſſion. Her innocent ſoul ſpeaks through her eyes the honeſt dictates of her heart. In our laſt conference, notwithſtanding her mother's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; notwithſtanding, what I bluſh to own, my utmoſt ardent ſolicitations to the contrary, ſhe perſiſted in her integrity, tore the papers which left her choice free, and treated us with an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which added charms to virtue.</p>

                  <p>Belmour, as well as myſelf, and lady Beverley, was a witneſs of the truth of them. I thought it my duty to inform you, as I know your delicacy with regard to her. And indeed I would in ſome meaſure endeavour to repair the injuries I have offered to your family, before I leave it for ever. —O Sir John, let not an ill-judged nicety debar you from a happineſs, which ſtands with open arms to receive you. Think what my folly has loſt in Araminta; and, when your indignation at the affront is a little reſpited, be bleſt yourſelf, and pity me. —

                  <p>To ſhew how willing I am to conceal every thing, now I have had my little female revenge, as my brother has promiſed us the fiddles this evening, Mr. Modely, as uſual, ſhall be my part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the dance.</p>

                  <p>Why then, brother, as we all ſeem in a ſtrange dilemma, why may'nt we have one dance in the garden? it will put us in good humour.</p>

                  <p>Come, lady Beverley, you muſt lay aſide all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities. If I have behaved improperly to you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I moſt ſincerely aſk your pardon, and hope the anxieties I have been under will ſufficiently plead my excuſe; my future conduct ſhall be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable.

                  <p>Here have I placed my happineſs, and here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it. O Caelia, if the ſeriouſneſs of my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould hereafter offend you, impute it to my infirmity; it can never proceed from want of affection.</p>
                  <q>

               <l>WELL, ladies, am I right, or am I not?</l>
               <l>Should not this fooliſh paſſion be forgot;</l>
