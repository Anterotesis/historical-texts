            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here haſt thou, in thy maturer Age, taught Poetry to tickle not the Fancy, but the Pride of the Patron. Comedy from thee learns a grave and ſolemn Air; while Tragedy ſtorms loud, and rends the affrighted Theatres with its Thunder. To ſooth thy wearied Limbs in Slumber, Alderman Hiſtory tells his tedious Tale; and again to awaken thee, Monſieur Romance performs his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Tricks of Dexterity. Nor leſs thy well-fed Bookſeller obeys thy Influence. By thy Advice the heavy, unread, Folio Lump, which long had dozed on the duſty Shelf, piece-mealed into Numbers, runs nimbly through the Nation. Inſtructed by thee ſome Books, like Quacks, impoſe on the World by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Wonders; while others turn Beaus, and truſt all their Merits to a gilded Outſide. Come, thou jolly Subſtance, with thy ſhining Face, keep back thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but hold forth thy tempting Rewards; thy ſhining, chinking Heap; thy quickly-convertible Bank-bill, big with unſeen Riches; thy often-varying Stock; the warm, the comfortable Houſe; and,

laſtly, a fair Portion of that bounteous Mother, whoſe flowing Breaſts yield redundant Suſtenance for all her numerous Off-ſpring, did not ſome too greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wantonly drive their Brethren from the Teat. Come thou, and if I am too taſteleſs of thy valuable Treaſures, warm my Heart with the tranſporting Thought of conveying them to others. Tell me, that through thy Bounty, the prattling Babes, whoſe innocent Play hath often been interrupted by my Labours, may one Time be amply rewarded for them.</p>
               <p>And now this ill-yoked Pair, this lean Shadow and this fat Subſtance, have prompted me to write, whoſe Aſſiſtance ſhall I invoke to direct my Pen?</p>

Thou, who doſt ſow the generous Seeds which Art nouriſhes, and brings to Perfection. Do thou kindly take me by the Hand, and lead me through all the Mazes, the winding Labyrinths of Nature. Initiate me into all thoſe Myſteries which profane Eyes never beheld. Teach me, which to thee is no difficult Taſk, to know Mankind better than they know themſelves. Remove that Miſt which dims the Intellects of Mortals, and cauſes them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Men for their Art, or to deteſt them for their Cunning in deceiving others, when they are, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Objects only of Ridicule, for deceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Strip off the thin Diſguiſe of Wiſdom from Self-Conceit, of Plenty from Avarice, and of Glory from Ambition.

               <p>And thou, O Learning, (for without thy Aſſiſtance, nothing pure, nothing correct, can Genius produce) do thou guide my Pen.

               <p>Laſtly, come Experience long converſant with the Wiſe, the Good, the Learned, and the Polite. Nor with them only, but with every Kind of Character from the Miniſter at his Levee, to the Bailiff in his Spunging-Houſe; from the Dutcheſs at her Drum, to the Landlady behind her Bar.

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>What befel Mr.</hi> Jones <hi>on his Arrival in</hi> London.</head>
               <p>THE learned Dr. <hi>Miſaubin</hi> uſed to ſay, that the proper Direction to him was, <hi>To Dr.</hi> Miſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, <hi>in the World;</hi> intimating, that there were few People in it to whom his great Reputation was not known, And, perhaps, upon a very nice Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Matter, we ſhall find that this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance bears no inconſiderable Part among the many Bleſſings of Grandeur.</p>
               <p>The great Happineſs of being known to Poſterity, with the Hopes of which we ſo delighted ourſelves in the preceding Chapter, is the Portion of few. To have the ſeveral Elements which compoſe our Names, as <hi>Sydenham</hi> expreſſes it, repeated a thouſand Years hence, is a Gift beyond the Power of Title and Wealth; and is ſcarce to be purchaſed, unleſs by the Sword and the Pen. But to avoid the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Imputation, while we yet live, of being <hi>one whom No-body knows,</hi> (a Scandal, by the by, as old as the Days of <hi>Homer</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See the 2d Odyſſey, ver. 175.</note>) will always be the envied Portion of thoſe, who have a legal Title either to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Eſtate.</p>
               <p>From that Figure, therefore, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer, who brought <hi>Sophia</hi> to Town, hath already made in this Hiſtory, the Reader will conclude, doubtleſs, it

muſt have been an eaſy Matter to have diſcovered his Houſe in <hi>London,</hi> without knowing the particular Street or Square which he inhabited, ſince he muſt have been one <hi>whom every Body knows.</hi> To ſay the Truth, ſo it would have been to any of thoſe Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are accuſtomed to attend the Regions of the Great: For the Doors of the Great are generally no leſs eaſy to find, than it is difficult to get Entrance into them. But <hi>Jones,</hi> as well as <hi>Partridge,</hi> was an entire Stranger in <hi>London;</hi> and as he happened to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive firſt in a Quarter of the Town, the Inhabitants of which have very little Intercourſe with the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of <hi>Hanover</hi> or <hi>Groſvenor</hi> Square, (for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> Lane) ſo he rambled about ſome Time, before he could even find his Way to thoſe happy Manſions, where Fortune ſegregates from the Vulgar, thoſe magnanimous Heroes, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of antient <hi>Britons, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors being born in better Days, by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Kinds of Merit, have entailed Riches and Honour on their Poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> being at length arrived at thoſe terreſtrial <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, would now ſoon have diſcovered his Lordſhip's Manſion; but the Peer unluckily quitted his former Houſe when he went for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and as he was juſt entered into a new one, the Fame of his Equipage had not yet ſufficiently blazed in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood: So that after a ſucceſsleſs Enquiry 'till the Clock had ſtruck Eleven, <hi>Jones,</hi> at laſt, yielded to the Advice of <hi>Partridge,</hi> and retreated to the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Gate</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> that being the Inn where he had firſt alighted, and where he retired to enjoy that Kind of Repoſe, which uſually attends Perſons in his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>Early in the Morning he again ſet forth in Purſuit of <hi>Sophia;</hi> and many a weary Step he took to no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Purpoſe than before. At laſt, whether it was that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0618300103:12"/>
Fortune relented, or whether it was no longer in her Power to diſappoint him, he came into the very Street which was honoured by his Lordſhip's Reſidence; and being directed to the Houſe, he gave one gentle Rap at the Door.</p>
               <p>The Porter, who, from the Modeſty of the Knock, had conceived no high Idea of the Perſon approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conceived but little better from the Appearance of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who was dreſt in a Suit of Fuſtian, and had by his Side the Weapon formerly purchaſed of the Serjeant; of which, tho' the Blade might be compoſed of well-tempered Steel, the Handle was compoſed only of Braſs, and that none of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. When <hi>Jones,</hi> therefore, enquired after the young Lady, who had come to Town with his Lordſhip, this Fellow anſwered ſurlily, <q rend="inline">'That there were no Ladies there.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> then deſired to ſee the Maſter of the Houſe; but was informed that his Lordſhip would ſee no Body that Morning. And upon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more preſſing, the Porter ſaid, <q rend="inline">'He had poſitive Orders to let no Perſon in; but if you think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,' ſaid he, 'to leave your Name, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Lordſhip; and if you call another Time, you ſhall know when he will ſee you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> now declared, <q rend="inline">'that he had very particular Buſineſs with the young Lady, and could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without ſeeing her.</q> Upon which the Porter, with no very agreeable Voice or Aſpect, affirmed, <q rend="inline">'That there was no young Lady in that Houſe, and, conſequently, none could he ſee; adding, Sure you are the ſtrangeſt Man I ever met with; for you will not take an Anſwer.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have often thought, that by the particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Cerberus</hi> the Porter of Hell, in the 6th <hi>Aeneid, Virgil</hi> might poſſibly intend to ſatyrize the Porters of the great Men in his Time; the Picture, at leaſt, reſembles thoſe who have the Honour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0618300103:13"/>
at the Doors of our great Men. The Porter in his Lodge, anſwers exactly to <hi>Cerberus</hi> in his Den, and, like him, muſt be appeaſed by a Sop, before Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs can be gained to his Maſter. Perhaps <hi>Jones</hi> might have ſeen him in that Light, and have recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Paſſage, where the Sybil, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an Entrance for <hi>Aeneas,</hi> preſents the Keeper of the <hi>Stygian</hi> Avenue with ſuch a Sop. <hi>Jones,</hi> in like Manner, now began to offer a Bribe to the human <hi>Cerberus,</hi> which a Footman overhearing, inſtantly advanced, and declared, <q rend="inline">'if Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> would give him the Sum propoſed, he would conduct him to the Lady.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> inſtantly agreed, and was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with conducted to the Lodging of Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> by the very Fellow who had attended the Ladies thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Day before.</p>
               <p>Nothing more aggravates ill Succeſs than the near Approach to Good. The Gameſter, who loſes his Party at Piquet by a ſingle Point, laments his bad Luck ten Times as much as he who never came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Proſpect of the Game. So in a Lottery, the Proprietors of the next Numbers to that which wins the great Prize, are apt to account themſelves much more unfortunate than their Fellow-Sufferes. In ſhort, theſe kind of hair-breadth Miſſings of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, look like the Inſults of Fortune, who may be conſidered as thus playing Tricks with us, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly diverting herſelf at our Expence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> who more than once already had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this frolickſome Diſpoſition of the Heathen God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like Manner: For he arrived at the Door of Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> about ten Minutes after the Departure of <hi>Sophia.</hi> He now addreſſed himſelf to the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Woman belonging to Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> who told him the diſagreeable News, that the Lady was gone, but could not tell him whither; and the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0618300103:14"/>
Anſwer he afterwards received from Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> herſelf. For as that Lady made no doubt but that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was a Perſon detached from her Uncle <hi>Weſtern,</hi> in Purſuit of his Daughter, ſo ſhe was too generous to betray her.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Jones</hi> had never ſeen Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> yet he had heard that a Couſin of <hi>Sophia</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Gentleman of that Name. This, however, in the preſent Tumult of his Mind, never once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to his Memory: But when the Footman, who had conducted him from his Lordſhip's, acquainted him with the great Intimacy between the Ladies, and with their calling each other Couſin, he then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Story of the Marriage which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly heard; and as he was preſently convinced that this was the ſame Woman, he became more ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Anſwer which he had received, and very earneſtly deſired Leave to wait on the Lady herſelf; but ſhe as poſitively refuſed him that Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> who, though he had never ſeen a Court, was better bred than moſt who frequent it, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any rude or abrupt Behaviour to a Lady. When he had received, therefore, a peremptory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, he retired for the preſent, ſaying to the waiting Woman, <q rend="inline">'That if this was an improper Hour to wait on her Lady, he would return in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; and that he then hoped to have the Honour of ſeeing her.'</q> The Civility with which he uttered this, added to the great Comelineſs of his Perſon, made an Impreſſion on the Waiting-Woman, and ſhe could not help anſwering; <q rend="inline">'Perhaps, Sir, you may: And, indeed, ſhe afterwards ſaid every Thing to her Miſtreſs, which ſhe thought moſt likely to prevail on her to admit a Viſit from the handſome young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; for ſo ſhe called him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> very ſhrewdly ſuſpected, that <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf was now with her Couſin, and was denied to him;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0618300103:15"/>
which he imputed to her Reſentment of what had happened at <hi>Upton.</hi> Having, therefore, diſpatched <hi>Partridge</hi> to procure him Lodgings, he remained all Day in the Street, watching the Door where he thought his Angel lay concealed; but no Perſon did he ſee iſſue forth, except a Servant of the Houſe. And in the Evening he returned to pay his Viſit to Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> which that good Lady at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to admit.</p>
               <p>There is a certain Air of natural Gentility, which it is neither in the Power of Dreſs to give, nor to conceal. Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> as hath been before hinted, was poſſeſſed of this in a very eminent Degree. He met, therefore, with a Reception from the Lady, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different from what his Apparel ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and after he had paid her his proper Reſpects, was deſired to ſit down.</p>
               <p>The Reader will not, I believe, be deſirous of knowing all the Particulars of this Converſation, which ended very little to the Satisfaction of poor <hi>Jones.</hi> For though Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> ſoon diſcovered the Lover, (as all Women have the Eyes of Hawks in thoſe Matters) yet ſhe ſtill thought it was ſuch a Lover, as a generous Friend of the Lady ſhould not betray her to. In ſhort, ſhe ſuſpected this was the very Mr. <hi>Blifil,</hi> from whom <hi>Sophia</hi> had flown; and all the Anſwers which ſhe artfully drew from <hi>Jones,</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Allworthy'</hi>s Family, confirmed her in this Opinion. She therefore ſtrictly denied any Knowledge concerning the Place whither <hi>Sophia</hi> was gone; nor could <hi>Jones</hi> obtain more than a Permiſſion to wait on her again the next Evening.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jones</hi> was departed, Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated her Suſpicion concerning Mr. <hi>Blifil,</hi> to her Maid; who anſwered, <q rend="inline">'Sure, Madam, he is too pretty a Man, in my Opinion, for any Woman in the World to run away from. I had rather fancy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0618300103:16"/>
it is Mr. <hi>Jones.—</hi>'Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> ſaid the Lady, what <hi>Jones?</hi>'</q> For <hi>Sophia</hi> had not given the leaſt Hint of any ſuch Perſon in all their Converſation: But Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> had been much more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and had acquainted her Siſter <hi>Abigail</hi> with the whole Hiſtory of <hi>Jones,</hi> which this now again relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> no ſooner received this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than ſhe immediately agreed with the Opinion of her Maid; and, what is very unaccountable, ſaw Charms in the gallant, happy Lover, which ſhe had overlooked in the ſlighted Squire. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>'Betty,</hi> ſays ſhe, 'you are certainly in the right: He is a very pretty Fellow, and I don't wonder that my Couſin's Maid ſhould tell you ſo many Women are fond of him. I am ſorry now I did not inform him where my Couſin was: And yet if he be ſo terrible a Rake as you tell me, it is a Pity ſhe ſhould ever ſee him any more; for what but her Ruin can happen from marrying a Rake and a Beggar againſt her Father's Conſent. I proteſt, if he be ſuch a Man as the Wench deſcribed him to you, it is but an Office of Charity to keep her from him; and, I am ſure, it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwiſe, who have taſted ſo bitterly of the Misfortunes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſuch Marriages.'</q>

               <p>Here ſhe was interrupted by the Arrival of a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which was no other than his Lordſhip; and as nothing paſſed at this Viſit either new or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or any Ways material to this Hiſtory, we ſhall here put an End to this Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>A Project of Mrs.</hi> Fitzpatrick, <hi>and her Viſit to Lady</hi> Bellaſton.</head>
               <p>WHEN Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> retired to Reſt, her Thoughts were entirely taken up by her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Sophia</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jones.</hi> She was, indeed, a little offended with the former, for the Diſingenuity which ſhe now diſcovered. In which Meditation ſhe had not long exerciſed her Imagination, before the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conceit ſuggeſted itſelf: That could ſhe poſſibly become the Means of preſerving <hi>Sophia</hi> from this Man, and of reſtoring her to her Father, ſhe ſhould, in all human Probability, by ſo great a Service to the Family, reconcile to herſelf both her Uncle and her Aunt <hi>Weſtern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this was one of her moſt favourite Wiſhes, ſo the Hope of Succeſs ſeemed ſo reaſonable, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained but to conſider of proper Methods to accompliſh her Scheme. To attempt to reaſon the Caſe with <hi>Sophia,</hi> did not appear to her one of thoſe Methods: For as <hi>Betty</hi> had reported from Mrs. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> that <hi>Sophia</hi> had a violent Inclination to <hi>Jones,</hi> ſhe conceived, that to diſſuade her from the Match, was an Endeavour of the ſame Kind as it would be, very heartily and earneſtly to entreat a Moth not to fly into a Candle.</p>
               <p>If the Reader will pleaſe to remember, that the Acquaintance which <hi>Sophia</hi> had with Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> was contracted at the Houſe of Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and muſt have grown at the very Time when Mrs. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi> lived with this latter Lady, he will want no Information, that Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> muſt have been acquainted with her likewiſe. They were, beſides, both equally her diſtant Relations.</p>
               <p>After much Conſideration, therefore, ſhe reſolved to go early in the Morning to that Lady, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0618300103:18"/>
to ſee her, unknown to <hi>Sophia,</hi> and to acquaint her with the whole Affair. For ſhe did not in the leaſt doubt, but that the prudent Lady, who had often ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed romantic Love, and indiſcreet Marriages, in her Converſation, would very readily concur in her Sentiments concerning this Match, and would lend her utmoſt Aſſiſtance to prevent it.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution ſhe accordingly executed; and the next Morning before the Sun, ſhe huddled on her Cloaths, and at a very unfaſhionable, unſeaſonable, unviſitable Hour went to Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> to whom ſhe got Acceſs, without the leaſt Knowledge or Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of <hi>Sophia,</hi> who though not aſleep, lay at that Time awake in her Bed, with <hi>Honour</hi> ſnoring by her Side.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> made many Apologies for this early, abrupt Viſit, at an Hour when, <q rend="inline">'ſhe ſaid, ſhe ſhould not have thought of diſturbing her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but upon Buſineſs of the utmoſt Conſequence.'</q> She then opened the whole Affair, told all ſhe had heard from <hi>Betty;</hi> and did not forget the Viſit which <hi>Jones</hi> had paid to herſelf the preceding Evening.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> anſwered with a Smile, <q rend="inline">'Then you have ſeen this terrible Man, Madam; pray is he ſo very fine a Figure as he is repreſented? For <hi>Etoff</hi> entertained me laſt Night almoſt two Hours with him. The Wench I believe is in Love with him by Reputation.'</q> Here the Reader will be apt to wonder, but the Truth is that Mrs. <hi>Etoff</hi> who had the Honour to pin and unpin the Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> had received complete Information concerning the ſaid Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and had faithfully conveyed the ſame to her Lady laſt Night (or rather that Morning) while ſhe was undreſſing; on which Accounts ſhe had been detained in her Office above the Space of an Hour and half.</p>

pleaſed with the Narratives of Mrs. <hi>Etoff</hi> at thoſe Seaſons, gave an extraordinary Attention to her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Jones,</hi> for <hi>Honour</hi> had deſcribed him as a very handſome Fellow, and Mrs. <hi>Etoff</hi> in her Hurry added ſo much to the Beauty of his Perſon to her Report, that Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> began to conceive him to be a kind of Miracle in Nature.</p>
               <p>The Curioſity which her Woman had inſpired, was now greatly increaſed by Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> who ſpoke as much in Favour of the Perſon of <hi>Jones,</hi> as ſhe had before ſpoken in Diſpraiſe of his Birth, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Fortune.</p>
               <p>When Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> had heard the whole, ſhe anſwered gravely, <q rend="inline">'Indeed Madam, this is a Matter of great Conſequence. Nothing can certainly be more commendable than the Part you act, and I ſhall be very glad to have my Share in the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a young Lady of ſo much Merit, and for whom I have ſo much Eſteem.'</q>

               </p>
               <p>The Lady pondered a little upon this, and thus anſwered—<q rend="inline">'Why, no, Madam, I think not. <hi>Di Weſtern</hi> hath deſcribed her Brother to me to be ſuch a Brute, that I cannot conſent to put any Woman under his Power who hath eſcaped from it. I have heard he behaved like a Monſter to his own Wife; for he is one of thoſe Wretches who think they have a Right to tyrannize over us, and from ſuch I ſhall ever eſteem it the Cauſe of my Sex to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue any Woman who is ſo unfortunate to be under their Power.—The Buſineſs, dear Couſin, will be only to keep Miſs <hi>Weſtern</hi> from ſeeing this young Fellow, till the good Company, which ſhe will

               </head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Jones</hi> had walked within Sight of a certain Door during the whole Day, which, though one of the ſhorteſt, appeared to him to be one of the longeſt in the whole Year. At length the Clock having ſtruck five he returned to Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> who, though it was a full Hour earlier than the decent Time of viſiting, receiv'd him very civilly; but ſtill perſiſted in her Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance concerning <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> in aſking for his Angel, had drop'd the Word Couſin; upon which Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Then, Sir, you know we are related, and as we are, you will permit me the Right of enquiring into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of your Buſineſs with my Couſin.'</q> Here <hi>Jones</hi> heſitated a good while, and at laſt anſwered, He had a conſiderable Sum of Money of hers in his Hands, which he deſired to deliver to her. He then produced the Pocket-book, and acquainted Mrs. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi> with the Contents, and with the Method in which they came into his Hands. He had ſcarce fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Story when a moſt violent Noiſe ſhook the whole Houſe. To attempt to deſcribe this Noiſe to thoſe who have heard it would be in vain, and to aim at giving any Idea of it to thoſe who have never heard the like, would be ſtill more vain: For it may be truly ſaid,</p>

               <p>In ſhort a Footman knocked, or rather thundered at the Door. <hi>Jones</hi> was a little ſurpriſed at the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0618300103:22"/>
Sound, having never heard it before; but Mrs. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi> very calmly ſaid, that as ſome Company were coming, ſhe could not make him any Anſwer now; but if he pleaſed to ſtay till they were gone, ſhe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ſhe had ſomething to ſay to him.</p>
               <p>The Door of the Room now flew open, and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puſhing in her Hoop ſideways before her, entered Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> who having firſt made a very low Curteſy to Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> and as low a one to Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> was uſhered to the upper End of the Room.</p>
               <p>We mention theſe minute Matters for the Sake of ſome Country Ladies of our Acquaintance, who think it contrary to the Rules of Modeſty to bend their Knees to a Man.</p>
               <p>The Company were hardly well ſettled, before the Arrival of the Peer lately mentioned cauſed a freſh Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>here being over, the Converſation began to be (as the Phraſe is) extremely brilliant. However, as nothing paſt in it which can be thought material to this Hiſtory, or, indeed, very material in itſelf, I ſhall omit the Relation; the rather as I have known ſome very fine polite Converſation grow extreamly dull, when tranſcribed into Books, or repeated on the Stage. Indeed this mental Repaſt is a Dainty, of which thoſe who are excluded from polite Aſſemblies, muſt be contented to remain as ignorant as they muſt of the ſeveral Dainties of <hi>French</hi> Cookery, which are only ſerved at the Tables of the <hi>Great.</hi> To ſay the Truth, as neither of theſe are adapted to every Taſte, they might both be often thrown away on the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Jones</hi> was rather a Spectator of this elegant Scene, than an Actor in it; for though in the ſhort Interval before the Peer's Arrival, Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> firſt, and afterwards Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> had addreſſed ſome of their Diſcourſe to him; yet no ſooner was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0618300103:23"/>
the noble Lord entered, than he engroſſed the whole Attention of the two Ladies to himſelf; and as he took no more Notice of <hi>Jones</hi> than if no ſuch Perſon had been preſent, unleſs by now and then ſtaring at him, the Ladies followed his Example.</p>
               <p>The Company had now ſtaid ſo long, that Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> plainly perceived they all deſigned to ſtay out each other. She therefore reſolved to rid herſelf of <hi>Jones,</hi> he being the Viſitant, to whom ſhe thought the leaſt Ceremony was due. Taking therefore an Opportunity of a Ceſſation of Chat, ſhe addreſſed herſelf gravely to him, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Sir, I ſhall not poſſibly be able to give you an Anſwer To-night, as to that Buſineſs; but if you pleaſe to leave Word where I may ſend to you To-morrow.'</q>—</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>An Adventure which happened to Mr.</hi> Jones, <hi>at his Lodgings, with ſome Account of a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who lodged there, and of the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, and her two Daughters.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE next Morning as early as it was decent, <hi>Jones</hi> attended at Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick'</hi>s Door, where he was anſwered that the Lady was not at Home; an Anſwer which ſurpriſed him the more, as he had walked backwards and forwards in the Street from Break of Day; and if ſhe had gone out, he muſt have ſeen her. This Anſwer, however, he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to receive, and not only now, but to five ſeveral Viſits which he made her that Day. To be plain with the Reader, the noble Peer, had from ſome Reaſon or other, perhaps from a Regard for the Lady's Honour, inſiſted that ſhe ſhould not ſee Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> whom he looked on as a Scrub, any more; and the Lady had complied in making that Promiſe to which we now ſee her ſo ſtrictly adhere.</p>
               <p>But as our gentle Reader may poſſibly have a better Opinion of the young Gentleman than her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and may even have ſome Concern, ſhould it be apprehended, that during this unhappy Separation from <hi>Sophia,</hi> he took up his Reſidence either at an Inn, or in the Street; we ſhall now give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Lodging, which was indeed in a very reputable Houſe, and in a very good Part of the Town.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> then had often heard Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> mention the Gentlewoman at whoſe Houſe he uſed to lodge when he was in Town. This Perſon, who as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0618300103:25"/>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> likewiſe knew, lived in <hi>Bond-Street,</hi> was the Widow of a Clergyman, and was left by him at his Deceaſe, in Poſſeſſion of two Daughters, and of a compleat Set of Manuſcript Sermons.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two Daughters, <hi>Nancy,</hi> the elder, was now arrived at the Age of ſeventeen, and <hi>Betty,</hi> the younger at that of ten.</p>
               <p>Hither <hi>Jones</hi> had diſpatched <hi>Partridge,</hi> and in this Houſe he was provided with a Room for himſelf in the ſecond Floor, and with one for <hi>Partridge</hi> in the fourth.</p>
               <p>The firſt Floor was inhabited by one of thoſe young Gentlemen, who, in the laſt Age were called Men of Wit and Pleaſure about Town, and properly enough: For as Men are uſually denominated from their Buſineſs or Profeſſion, ſo Pleaſure may be ſaid to have been the only Buſineſs or Profeſſion of thoſe Gentlemen to whom Fortune had made all uſeful Occupations unneceſſary. Play-Houſes, Coffee-Houſes and Taverns were the Scenes of their Rendezvous, Wit and Humour were the Entertainment of their looſer Hours, and Love was the Buſineſs of their more ſerious Moments. Wine and the Muſes conſpired to kindle the brighteſt Flames in their Breaſts; nor did they only admire, but ſome were able to celebrate the Beauty they admired, and all to judge of the Merit of ſuch Compoſitions.</p>
               <p>Such therefore were properly called the Men of Wit and Pleaſure; but I queſtion whether the ſame Appellation may, with the ſame Propriety, be given to thoſe young Gentlemen of our Times, who have the ſame Ambition to be diſtinguiſhed for Parts. Wit certainly they have nothing to do with. To give them their due, they ſoar a Step higher than their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and may be called Men of Wiſdom and Vertù (take heed you do not read Virtue). Thus at an Age when the Gentlemen abovementioned employed their Time in toaſting the Charms of a Woman, or in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0618300103:26"/>
making Sonnets in her Praiſe; in giving their Opinion of a Play at the Theatre, or of a Poem at <hi>Will'</hi>s or <hi>Button'</hi>s; theſe Gentlemen are conſidering of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to bribe a Corporation, or meditating Speeches for the Houſe of Commons, or rather for the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines. But the Science of Gaming is that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others employs their Thoughts. Theſe are the Studies of their graver Hours, while for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements they have the vaſt Circle of Connoiſſeur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Painting, Muſic, Statuary, and natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, or rather <hi>unnatural,</hi> which deals in the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and knows nothing of Nature, except her Monſters and Imperfections.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jones</hi> had ſpent the whole Day in vain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> he returned at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate to his Apartment. Here while he was vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grief in private, he heard a violent Uproar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Stairs; and ſoon after a female Voice begged him for Heaven's Sake to come and prevent Murder. <hi>Jones,</hi> who was never backward on any Occaſion, to help the Diſtreſſed, immediately ran down Stairs; when ſtepping into the Dining-room, whence all the Noiſe iſſued, he beheld the young Gentleman of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and <hi>Vertù</hi> juſt before mentioned, pinned cloſe to the Wall by his Footman, and a young Woman ſtanding by, wringing her Hands, and crying out, <q rend="inline">'He will be murdered, he will be murdered; and indeed the poor Gentleman ſeemed in ſome Danger of being choaked,'</q> when <hi>Jones</hi> flew haſtily to his Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and reſcued him juſt as he was breathing his laſt, from the unmerciful Clutches of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Though the Fellow had received ſeveral Kicks and Cuffs from the little Gentleman, who had more Spirit than Strength, he had made it a kind of Scruple of Conſcience to ſtrike his Maſter, and would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with only choaking him; but towards <hi>Jones</hi> he bore no ſuch Reſpect: He no ſooner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0618300103:27"/>
found himſelf a little roughly handled by his new Antagoniſt, than he gave him one of thoſe Punches in the Guts, which, tho' the Spectators at <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'</hi>s Amphitheatre have ſuch exquiſite Delight in Seeing them, convey but very little Pleaſure in the Feeling.</p>
               <p>The luſty Youth had no ſooner received this Blow, than he meditated a moſt grateful Return; and now enſued a Combat between <hi>Jones</hi> and the Footman, which was very fierce, but ſhort; for this Fellow was no more able to contend with <hi>Jones,</hi> than his Maſter had before been to contend with him.</p>
               <p>And now Fortune, according to her uſual Cuſtom, reverſed the Face of Affairs, the former Victor lay breathleſs on the Ground, and the vanquiſhed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had recovered Breath enough to thank Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> for his ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance: He received likewiſe the hearty Thanks of the young Woman preſent, who was indeed no other than Miſs <hi>Nancy,</hi> the eldeſt Daughter of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Footman having now recovered his Legs, ſhook his Head at <hi>Jones,</hi> and with a ſagacious Look, cry'd,—O d—n me, I'll have nothing more to do with you, you have been upon the Stage, or I am d—nably miſtaken: And indeed we may forgive this his Suſpicion; for ſuch was the Agility and Strength of our Heroe, that he was perhaps a Match for one of the firſt Rate Boxers, and could with great Eaſe, have beaten all the muffled <note n="*" place="bottom">Leſt Poſterity ſhould be puzzled by this Epithet, I think proper to explain it by an Advertiſement which was publiſhed <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. 1747.

His Maſter foaming with Wrath, ordered his Man immediately to ſtrip, to which the latter very readily agreed, on Condition of receiving his Wages. This Condition was preſently complied with, and the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was diſcharged.</p>
               <p>And now the young Gentleman whoſe Name was <hi>Nightingale,</hi> very ſtrenuouſly inſiſted that his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer ſhould take Part of a Bottle of Wine with him; to which <hi>Jones,</hi> after much Entreaty, conſented; tho' more out of Complaiſance than Inclination; for the Uneaſineſs of his Mind fitted him very little for Converſation at this Time. Miſs <hi>Nancy</hi> likewiſe, who was the only Female then in the Houſe, her Mamma and Siſter being gone to the Play, condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to favour them with her Company.</p>
               <p>When the Bottle and Glaſſes were on the Table, the Gentleman began to relate the Occaſion of the preceding Diſturbance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I hope, Sir, ſaid he to <hi>Jones,</hi> you will not, from this Accident, conclude, that I make a Cuſtom of ſtriking my Servants; for I aſſure you this is the firſt Time I have been guilty of it in my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and I have paſſed by many provoking Faults in this very Fellow, before he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me to it; but when you hear what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened this Evening, you will, I believe, think me

excuſeable. I happened to come home ſeveral Hours before my uſual Time, when I found four Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Cloth at Whiſk by my Fire;—and my <hi>Hoyle,</hi> Sir,—my beſt <hi>Hoyle,</hi> which coſt me a Guinea, lying open on the Table, with a Quantity of Porter ſpilt on one of the moſt material Leaves of the whole Book. This, you will allow, was provoking; but I ſaid nothing till the reſt of the honeſt Company were gone, and then gave the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a gentle Rebuke, who, inſtead of expreſſing any Concern, made me a pert Anſwer, <q rend="inline">'"That Servants muſt have their Diverſions as well as other People; that he was ſorry for the Accident which had happened to the Book; but that ſeveral of his Acquaintance had bought the ſame for a Shilling; and that I might ſtop as much in his Wages if I pleaſed:"</q> 'I now gave him a ſeverer Reprimand than before, when the Raſcal had the Inſolence to—In ſhort he imputed my early coming Home to—In ſhort, he caſt a Reflection,—He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Name of a young Lady, in a Manner—In ſuch a Manner that incenſed me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Patience, and in my Paſſion, I ſtruck him.'</q>

               <p>Our Company had not ſat long before they were joined by the Mother and Daughter, at their Return from the Play.

that at their breaking up, the young Gentleman ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired his further Acquaintance. Miſs <hi>Nancy</hi> was well pleaſed with him; and the Widow, quite charm'd with her new Lodger, invited him with the other, next Morning to Breakfaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> on his Part, was no leſs ſatisfied. As for Miſs <hi>Nancy,</hi> tho' a very little Creature, ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pretty, and the Widow had all the Charms which can adorn a Woman near fifty. As ſhe was one of the moſt innocent Creatures in the World, ſo ſhe was one of the moſt chearful. She never thought, nor ſpoke, nor wiſhed any ill, and had conſtantly that Deſire of pleaſing, which may be called the happieſt of all Deſires in this, that it ſcarce ever fails of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its Ends, when not diſgraced by Affectation. In ſhort, though her Power was very ſmall, ſhe was in her Heart one of the warmeſt Friends. She had been a moſt affectionate Wife, and was a moſt fond and tender Mother.</p>
               <p>As our Hiſtory doth not, like a News-Paper, give great Characters to People who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again; the Reader may hence conclude, that this excellent Woman will hereafter appear to be of ſome Importance in our Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>Jones</hi> a little pleaſed with the young Gentleman himſelf, whoſe Wine he had been drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He thought he diſcerned in him much good Senſe, though a little too much tainted with Town Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; but what recommended him moſt to <hi>Jones</hi> were ſome Sentiments of great Generoſity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, which occaſionally dropt from him; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly many Expreſſions of the higheſt Diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Affair of Love. On which Subject the young Gentleman delivered himſelf in a Language which might have very well become an <hi>Arcadian</hi> Shepherd of Old, and which appeared very extraordinary when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0618300103:31"/>
proceeding from the Lips of a modern fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but he was only one by Imitation, and meant by Nature for a much better Character.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>What arrived while the Company were at Breakfaſt, with ſome Hints concerning the Government of Daughters.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OUR Company brought together in the Morning the ſame good Inclinations towards each other, with which they had ſeparated the Evening before; but poor <hi>Jones</hi> was extreme diſconſolate; for he had juſt received Information from <hi>Partridge,</hi> that Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> had left her Lodging, and that he could not learn whither ſhe was gone. This News highly affected him, and his Countenance, as well as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, in Defiance of all his Endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifeſt Indications of a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind.</p>
               <p>The Diſcourſe turned at preſent, as before, on Love; and Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> again expreſſed many of thoſe warm, generous, and diſintereſted Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this Subject, which wiſe and ſober Men call romantic, but which wiſe and ſober Women ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally regard in a better Light. Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> (for ſo the Mrs. of the Houſe was called) greatly approved theſe Sentiments; but when the young Gentleman appealed to Miſs <hi>Nancy,</hi> ſhe anſwered only, <q rend="inline">'That ſhe believed the Gentleman who had ſpoke the leaſt, was capable of feeling the moſt.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Compliment was ſo apparently directed to <hi>Jones,</hi> that we ſhould have been ſorry had he paſſed it by unregarded. He made her indeed a very polite An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and concluded with an oblique Hint, that her own Silence ſubjected her to a Suſpicion of the ſame
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0618300103:32"/>
Kind: For indeed ſhe had ſcarce opened her Lips ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, or the laſt Evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I am glad <hi>Nanny,</hi> ſays Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath made the Obſervation; I proteſt I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his Opinion.

She hath not ſpoke twenty Words this Week.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here their Converſation was interrupted by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a Maid-Servant, who brought a Bundle in her Hands, which, ſhe ſaid, <q rend="inline">'was delivered by a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Mr. <hi>Jones.</hi>'</q> She added, <q rend="inline">'that the Man immediately went away, ſaying, it required no Anſwer.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> expreſſed ſome Surprize on this Occaſion, and declared it muſt be ſome Miſtake: But the Maid perſiſting that ſhe was certain of the Name, all the Women were deſirous of having the Bundle imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately opened; which Operation was at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by little <hi>Betſy,</hi> with the Conſent of Mr. <hi>Jones;</hi> and the Contents were found to be a Domino, a Maſk, and a Maſquerade Ticket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> was now more poſitive than ever, in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theſe Things muſt have been delivered by Miſtake; and Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> herſelf expreſſed ſome Doubt, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'ſhe knew not what to think.'</q> But when Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> was aſked, he delivered a very different Opinion. <q rend="inline">'All I can conclude from it, Sir,' ſaid he, 'is, that you are a very happy Man: For I make no doubt but theſe were ſent you by ſome Lady whom you will have the Happineſs of meeting at the Maſquerade.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had not a ſufficient Degree of Vanity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any ſuch flattering Imagination; nor did Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> herſelf give much Aſſent to what Mr. <hi>Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale</hi> had ſaid, 'till Miſs <hi>Nancy</hi> having lifted up the

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> and Miſs <hi>Nancy</hi> now both agreed with Mr. <hi>Nightingale;</hi> nay, <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf was almoſt perſuaded to be of the ſame Opinion. And as no other Lady but Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> he thought, knew his Lodging, he began to flatter himſelf with ſome Hopes that it came from her, and that he might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſee his <hi>Sophia.</hi> Theſe Hopes had ſurely very little Foundation; but as the Conduct of Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick,</hi> in not ſeeing him according to her Promiſe, and in quitting her Lodgings, had been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived ſome faint Hopes, that ſhe (of whom he had formerly heard a very whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Character) might poſſibly intend to do him that Service, in a ſtrange Manner, which ſhe declined do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by more ordinary Methods. To ſay the Truth, as nothing certain could be concluded from ſo odd and uncommon an Incident, he had the greater Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to draw what imaginary Concluſions from it he pleaſed. As his Temper therefore was naturally ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, he indulged it on this Occaſion, and his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination worked up a thouſand Conceits, to favour and ſupport his Expectations of meeting his dear <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> in the Evening.</p>
               <p>Reader, if thou haſt any good Wiſhes towards me, I will fully repay them, by wiſhing thee to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of this ſanguine Diſpoſition of Mind: Since, after having read much, and conſidered long on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Happineſs which hath employed ſo many great Pens, I am almoſt inclined to fix it in the Poſſeſſion of this Temper; which puts us; in a Manner, out of the Reach of Fortune, and makes us happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0618300103:34"/>
her Aſſiſtance. Indeed the Senſations of Pleaſure it gives are much more conſtant, as well as much keener than thoſe which that blind Lady beſtows; Nature having wiſely contrived, that ſome Satiety and Languor ſhould be annexed to all our real Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, leſt we ſhould be ſo taken up by them, as to be ſtopt from further Purſuits. I make no Manner of doubt but that, in this Light, we may ſee the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary future Chancellor juſt called to the Bar, the Archbiſhop in Crape, and the Prime Miniſter at the Tail of an Oppoſition, more truly happy than thoſe who are inveſted with all the Power and Profit of theſe reſpective Offices.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> having now determined to go to the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade that Evening, Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> offered to conduct him thither. The young Gentleman, at the ſame Time, offered Tickets to Miſs <hi>Nancy</hi> and her Mother; but the good Woman would not accept them. She ſaid, <q rend="inline">'She did not conceive the Harm which ſome People imagined in a Maſquerade; but that ſuch extravagant Diverſions were only proper for Perſons of Quality and Fortune, and not for young Women who were to get their Living, and could, at beſt, hope to be married to a good Tradeſman.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>—<q rend="inline">'A Tradeſman! cries <hi>Nightingale,</hi> you ſhan't undervalue my <hi>Nancy.</hi> There is not a Nobleman upon Earth above her Merit.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O fie! Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi>' anſwered Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> 'you muſt not fill the Girl's Head with ſuch Fancies: But if it was her good Luck (ſays the Mother with a Simper) to find a Gentleman of your generous Way of thinking, I hope ſhe would make a better Return to his Generoſity, than to give her Mind up to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Pleaſures. Indeed where young Ladies bring great Fortunes themſelves, they have ſome Right to inſiſt on ſpending what is their own:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0618300103:35"/>
and on that Account, I have heard the Gentlemen ſay, a Man has ſometimes a better Bargain with a poor Wife, than with a rich one.—But let my Daughters marry whom they will, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make them Bleſſings to their Huſbands:—I beg, therefore, I may hear of no more Maſquerades. <hi>Nancy</hi> is, I am certain, too good a Girl to deſire to go; for ſhe muſt remember when you carried her thither laſt Year, it almoſt turned her Head, and ſhe did not return to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to her Needle, in a Month afterwards.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though a gentle Sigh which ſtole from the Boſom of <hi>Nancy,</hi> ſeemed to argue ſome ſecret Diſapprobation of theſe Sentiments, ſhe did not dare openly to oppoſe them. For as this good Woman had all the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo ſhe had preſerved all the Authority of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and as her Indulgence to the Deſires of her Children, was only reſtrained, by her Fears for their Safety and future Welfare, ſo ſhe never ſuffered thoſe Commands, which proceeded from ſuch Fears, to be either diſobeyed or diſputed. And this the young Gentleman who had lodged two Years in the Houſe, knew ſo well, that he preſently acquieſced in the Refuſal.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> who grew every Minute fonder of <hi>Jones,</hi> was very deſirous of his Company that Day to Dinner at the Tavern, where he offered to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to ſome of his Acquaintance; but <hi>Jones</hi> begged to be excuſed, <q rend="inline">'as his Cloaths, he ſaid, were not yet come to Town.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>To confeſs the Truth, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was now in a Situation, which ſometimes happens to be the Caſe of young Gentlemen of much better Figure than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In ſhort, he had not one Penny in his Pocket; a Situation in much greater Credit among the ancient Philoſophers, than among the modern wiſe Men who live in <hi>Lombard</hi> Street, or thoſe who frequent <hi>White'</hi>s
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0618300103:36"/>
Chocolate Houſe. And, perhaps, the great Honours which thoſe Philoſophers have aſcribed to an empty Pocket, may be one of the Reaſons of that high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in which they are held in the aforeſaid Street and Chocolate-Houſe.</p>
               <p>Now if the antient Opinion, that Men might live very comfortably on Virtue only, be, as the modern wiſe Men juſt above-mentioned pretend to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, a notorious Error; no leſs falſe is, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that Poſition of ſome Writers of Romance, that a Man can live altogether on Love: For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever delicious Repaſts this may afford to ſome of our Senſes or Appetites, it is moſt certain it can afford none to others. Thoſe, therefore, who have placed too great a Confidence in ſuch Writers, have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced their Error when it was too late; and have found that Love was no more capable of allaying Hunger, than a Roſe is capable of delighting the Ear, or a Violin of gratifying the Smell.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, therefore, all the Delicacies which Love had ſet before him, namely, the Hopes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sophia</hi> at the Maſquerade; on which, however ill-founded his Imagination might be, he had volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly feaſted during the whole Day, the Evening no ſooner came, than Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> began to languiſh for ſome Food of a groſſer Kind. <hi>Partridge</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this by Intution, and took the Occaſion to give ſome oblique Hints concerning the Bank-bill, and when thoſe were rejected with Diſdain, he collected Courage enough once more to mention a Return to Mr. <hi>Allworthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>'Partridge,</hi> cries <hi>Jones,</hi> you cannot ſee my Fortune in a more deſperate Light than I ſee it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and I begin heartily to repent, that I ſuffered you to leave a Place, where you was ſettled, and to follow me. However, I inſiſt now on your return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Home; and for the Expence and Trouble which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0618300103:37"/>
you have ſo kindly put yourſelf to on my Account, all the Cloaths I left behind in your Care, I deſire you would take as your own. I am ſorry I can make you no other Acknowledgment.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſpoke theſe Words with ſo pathetic an Accent, that <hi>Partridge,</hi> among whoſe Vices Ill-Nature or Hardneſs of Heart were not numbered, burſt into Tears; and after ſwearing he would not quit him in his Diſtreſs, he began with the moſt earneſt Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to urge his return Home. <q rend="inline">'For Heaven's Sake, Sir,' ſays he, 'do but conſider: What can your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour do?

Do what you will, Sir, or go wherever you pleaſe, I am reſolved not to deſert you.—But pray, Sir, conſider,—Do pray, Sir, for your own Sake, take it into your Conſideration; and I'm ſure,' ſays he, 'that your own Good-Senſe will bid you return Home.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'How often ſhall I tell thee, anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> that I have no Home to return to.

His laſt Words were,—O <hi>Partridge,</hi> they ſtill ring in my Ears—His laſt Words were, when he gave me a Sum of Money, what it was I know not, but conſiderable I'm ſure it was.—His laſt Words were—I am reſolved from this Day forward, on no Account, to converſe with you any more.'</q>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0618300103:38"/>
a conſiderable Sum; he knew not how much; and what was become of the Money?</p>
               <p>In both theſe Points he now received full Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; on which he was proceeding to comment, when he was interrupted by a Meſſage from Mr. <hi>Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> who deſired his Maſter's Company in his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>When the two Gentlemen were both attired for the Maſquerade, and Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> had given Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for Chairs to be ſent for, a Circumſtance of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs occurred to <hi>Jones,</hi> which will appear very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to many of my Readers. This was how to procure a Shilling; but if ſuch Readers will reflect a little on what they have themſelves felt from the Want of a thouſand Pound, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to execute a favourite Scheme, they will have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Idea of what Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> felt on this Occaſion. For this Sum, therefore, he applied to <hi>Partridge,</hi> which was the firſt he had permitted him to advance, and was the laſt he intended that poor Fellow ſhould advance in his Service. To ſay the Truth, <hi>Partridge</hi> had lately made no Offer of this Kind; whether it was that he deſired to ſee the Bank-bill broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that Diſtreſs ſhould prevail on <hi>Jones</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Home, or from what other Motive it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I will not determine.</p>

               <p>OUR Cavaliers now arrived at that Temple, where <hi>Heydegger,</hi> the great <hi>Arbiter Deliciarum,</hi> the great High-Prieſt of Pleaſure preſides; and, like other Heathen Prieſts, impoſes on his Votaries by the pretended Preſence of the Deity, when in reality no ſuch Deity is there.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> having taken a Turn or two with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0618300103:39"/>
his Companion, ſoon left him, and walked off with a Female, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Now you are here, Sir, you muſt beat about for your own Game.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> began to entertain ſtrong Hopes that his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> was preſent; and theſe Hopes gave him more Spirits than the Lights, the Muſic, and the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; though theſe are pretty ſtrong Antidotes againſt the Spleen. He now accoſted every Woman he ſaw, whoſe Stature, Shape, or Air, bore any Reſemblance to his Angel. To all of whom he endeavoured to ſay ſomething ſmart, in order to engage an Anſwer, by which he might diſcover that Voice which he thought it impoſſible he ſhould miſtake. Some of theſe anſwered by a Queſtion, in a ſqueaking Voice, <hi>Do you know me?</hi> Much the greater Numbers ſaid, <hi>I don't know you, Sir;</hi> and nothing more. Some called him an impertinent Fellow; ſome made him no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at all; ſome ſaid, <hi>Indeed I don't know your Voice, and I ſhall have nothing to ſay to you;</hi> and many gave him as kind Anſwers as he could wiſh, but not in the Voice he deſired to hear.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was talking with one of theſe laſt, (who was in the Habit of a Shepherdeſs) a Lady in a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino came up to him, and ſlapping him on the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whiſpered him, at the ſame Time, in the Ear, <q rend="inline">'If you talk any longer with that Trollop, I will acquaint Miſs <hi>Weſtern.</hi>'</q>

               <p>The Maſk walked haſtily to the upper end of the innermoſt Apartment before ſhe ſpoke, and then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwering him, ſat down, and declared ſhe was tired. <hi>Jones</hi> ſat down by her, and ſtill perſiſted in his Entreaties; at laſt the Lady coldly anſwered,

                  <q rend="inline">'I imagined Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> had been a more diſcerning Lover, than to ſuffer any Diſguiſe to conceal his Miſtreſs from him.

               <p>Though the Reader may have already conceived no very ſublime Idea of the Virtue of the Lady in the Maſk; and tho' poſſibly ſhe may hereafter appear not to deſerve one of the firſt Characters of her Sex; yet, it is certain, theſe generous Sentiments made a ſtrong Impreſſion upon her, and greatly added to the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had before conceived for our young Heroe.</p>
               <p>The Lady now, after a Silence of a few Moments, ſaid, <q rend="inline">'She did not ſee his Pretenſions to <hi>Sophia</hi> ſo much in the Light of Preſumption, as of Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Young Fellows, ſays ſhe, can never have too aſpiring Thoughts. I love Ambition in a young Man, and I would have you cultivate it as much as poſſible. Perhaps you may ſucceed with thoſe who are infinitely ſuperior in Fortune, nay, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced there are Women,—but don't you think me a ſtronge Creature, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> to be thus giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Advice to a Man, with whom I am ſo little acquainted, and one with whoſe Behaviour to me I have ſo little Reaſon to be pleaſed?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Jones</hi> began to apologize, and to hope he had not offended in any thing he had ſaid of her Couſin. —To which the Maſk anſwered, <q rend="inline">'And are you ſo little verſed in the Sex, to imagine you can well

affront a Lady more, than by entertaining her with your Paſſion for another Woman? If the Fairy Queen had had no better Opinion of your Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhe would ſcarce have appointed you to meet her at a Maſquerade.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had never leſs Inclination to an Amour than at preſent; but Gallantry to the Ladies was among his Principles of Honour; and he held it as much incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him to accept a Challenge to Love, as if it had been a Challenge to Fight. Nay, his very Love to <hi>Sophia</hi> made it neceſſary for him to keep well with the Lady, as he made no doubt but ſhe was capable of bringing him into the Preſence of the other.</p>
               <p>He began therefore to make a very warm Anſwer to her laſt Speech, when a Maſk in the Character of an old Woman, joined them. This Maſk was one of thoſe Ladies who go to a Maſquerade only to vent Ill-nature, by telling People rude Truths, and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, as the Phraſe is, to ſpoil as much Sport as they are able. This good Lady therefore, having obſerved <hi>Jones,</hi> and his Friend, whom ſhe well knew, in cloſe Conſultation together in a Corner of the Room, concluded ſhe could no where ſatisfy her Spleen better than by interrupting them. She attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them therefore, and ſoon drove them from their Retirement; nor was ſhe contented with this, but purſued them to every Place which they ſhifted to avoid her; till Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> ſeeing the Diſtreſs of his Friend, at laſt relieved him, and engaged the old Woman in another Purſuit.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Jones</hi> and his Maſk were walking together about the Room, to rid themſelves of the Teazer, he obſerved his Lady ſpeak to ſeveral Maſks, with the ſame Freedom of Acquaintance as if they had been barefaced. He could not help expreſſing his Surpriſe at this, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Sure, Madam, you muſt have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Diſcernment to know People in all Diſguiſes.'</q>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0618300103:43"/>
To which the Lady anſwered, <q rend="inline">'You cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Thing more inſipid and childiſh than a Maſquerade to the People of Faſhion, who in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral know one another as well here, as when they meet in an Aſſembly or a Drawing-room; nor will any Woman of Condition converſe with a Perſon with whom ſhe is not acquainted. In ſhort, the Generality of Perſons whom you ſee here, may more properly be ſaid to kill Time in this Place, than in any other; and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longeſt Sermon. To ſay the Truth, I begin to be in that Situation myſelf, and if I have any Faculty at gueſſing, you are not much better pleaſed. I proteſt it would be almoſt Charity in me to go Home for your Sake.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I know but one Charity equal to it, cries <hi>Jones,</hi> and that is to ſuffer me to wait on you Home. Sure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Lady, you have a ſtrange opinion of me, to imagine, that upon ſuch an Acquaintance, I would let you into my Doors at this Time o'Night. I fancy you impute the Friendſhip I have ſhewn my Couſin, to ſome other Motive. Confeſs honeſtly; don't you conſider this contrived Interview as little better than a downright Aſſignation? Are you uſed, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> to make theſe ſudden Conqueſts? I am not uſed, Madam, ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> to ſubmit to ſuch ſudden Conqueſts; but as you have taken my Heart by Surprize, the reſt of my Body hath a Right to follow; ſo you muſt pardon me if I reſolve to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you wherever you go.'</q> He accompanied theſe Words with ſome proper Actions; upon which the Lady, after a gentle Rebuke, and ſaying their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity would be obſerved, told him, <q rend="inline">'She was going to ſup with an Acquaintance, whither ſhe hoped he would not follow her; for if you ſhould, ſaid ſhe, I ſhall be thought an unaccountable Creature, though my Friend indeed is not cenſorious, yet I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0618300103:44"/>
hope you won't follow me: I proteſt I ſhall not know what to ſay, if you do.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Lady preſently after quitted the Maſquerade, and <hi>Jones,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſevere Prohibition he had received, preſumed to attend her. He was now reduced to the ſame Dilemma we have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, namely, the want of Shilling, and could not relieve it by borrowing as before. He therefore walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boldly on after the Chair in which his Lady rode, purſued by a grand Huzza from all the Chairmen preſent, who wiſely take the beſt Care they can to diſcountenance all walking afoot by their Betters. Luckily however the Gentry who attend at the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra-Houſe were too buſy to quit their Stations, and as the Lateneſs of the Hour prevented him from meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of their Brethren in the Street, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Moleſtation, in a Dreſs, which, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seaſon, would have certainly raiſed a Mob at his Heels.</p>
               <p>The Lady was ſet down in a Street, not far from <hi>Hanover-Square,</hi> where the Door being preſently opened, ſhe was carried in, and the Gentleman, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ceremony, walked in after her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> and his Companion were now together in a very well-furniſhed and well-warm'd Room, when the Female ſtill ſpeaking in her Maſquerade Voice, ſaid, ſhe was ſurprized at her Friend, who muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely have forgot her Appointment; at which after venting much Reſentment, ſhe ſuddenly expreſt ſome Apprehenſion from <hi>Jones,</hi> and aſked him what the World would think of their having been alone toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Houſe at that Time of Night? But inſtead of a direct Anſwer to ſo important a Queſtion, <hi>Jones</hi> began to be very importunate with the Lady to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk, and at length having prevailed, there appeared not Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> but the Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> herſelf.</p>
               <p>It would be tedious to give the particular Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0618300103:45"/>
which conſiſted of very common and ordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, and which laſted from two till ſix o'Clock in the Morning. It is ſufficient to mention all of it that is any wiſe material to this Hiſtory. And this was a Promiſe that the Lady would endeavour to find out <hi>Sophia,</hi> and in a few Days bring him to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with her, on Condition that he would then take his Leave of her. When this was thoroughly ſettled, and a ſecond Meeting in the Evening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at the ſame Place, they ſeparated; the Lady returned to her Houſe, and <hi>Jones</hi> to his Lodgings.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JONES</hi> having refreſhed himſelf with a few Hours Sleep, ſummoned <hi>Partridge</hi> to his Preſence; and delivering him a Bank Note of fifty Pounds, ordered him to go and change it. <hi>Partridge</hi> received this with ſparkling Eyes, though when he came to reflect farther, it raiſed in him ſome Suſpicions not very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Honour of his Maſter; to theſe the dreadful Idea he had of the Maſquerade, the Diſguiſe in which his Maſter had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad all Night, contributed. In plain Language, the only Way he could poſſibly find to account for the Poſſeſſion of this Note, was by Robbery; and, to confeſs the Truth, the Reader, unleſs he ſhould ſuſpect it was owing to the Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> can hardly imagine any other.</p>
               <p>To clear therefore the Honour of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and to do Juſtice to the Liberality of the Lady, he had really received this Preſent from her, who, though ſhe did not give much in to the Hackney Charities of the Age, ſuch as building Hoſpitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, entirely void of that Chriſtian Virtue; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

(very righty I think) that a young Fellow of Merit, without a Shilling in the World, was no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Object of this Virtue.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> had been invited to dine this Day with Mrs. <hi>Miller.</hi> At the appointed Hour therefore the two young Gentlemen, with the two Girls, attended in the Parlour, where they waited from three till almoſt five before the good Woman appeared. She had been out of Town to viſit a Relation, of whom, at her Return, ſhe gave the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account,</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I hope, Gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; I am ſure if you knew the Occaſion.—I have been to ſee a Couſin of mine, about ſix Miles off, who now lies in.—It ſhould be a Warning to all Perſons (ſays ſhe, looking at her Daughters) how they marry indiſcreetly. There is no Happineſs in this World, without a Competency. O <hi>Nancy!</hi> how ſhall I deſcribe the wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which I found your poor Couſin; ſhe hath ſcarce lain in a Week, and there was ſhe, this dreadful Weather, in a cold Room, without any Curtains to her Bed, and not a Buſhel of Coals in her Houſe to ſupply her with Fire: Her ſecond Son, that ſweet little Fellow, lies ill of a Quinzy in the ſame Bed with his Mother, for there is no other Bed in the Houſe. Poor little <hi>Tommy!</hi> I believe, <hi>Nancy,</hi> you will never ſee your Favourite any more, for he is really very ill. The reſt of the Children are in pretty good Health; but <hi>Molly,</hi> I am afraid, will do herſelf an Injury; ſhe is but thirteen Years old, Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and yet, in my Life, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw a better Nurſe: She tends both her Mother and her Brother; and what is wonderful in a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo young, ſhe ſhows all the Chearfulneſs in the World to her Mother; and yet I ſaw her.—I ſaw the poor Child, Mr <hi>Nightingale,</hi> turn about,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0618300103:47"/>
and privately wipe the Tears from her Eyes.'</q> Here Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> was prevented, by her own Tears, from going on, and there was not, I believe, a Perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who did not accompany her in them; at length ſhe a little recovered herſelf, and proceeded thus, <q rend="inline">'In all this Diſtreſs the Mother ſupports her Spirits in a ſurpriſing Manner. The Danger of her Son ſits heavieſt upon her, and yet ſhe endeavours as much as poſſible to conceal even this Concern, on her Huſband's Account. Her Grief, however, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gets the better of all her Endeavours; for ſhe was always extravagantly fond of this Boy, and a moſt ſenſible, ſweet-tempered Creature it is. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt never was I more affected in my Life, than when I heard the little Wretch, who is hardly yet ſeven Years old, while his Mother was wetting him with her Tears, beg her to be comforted.—Indeed, Mamma, cry'd the Child, I ſhan't die, God Almighty, I'm ſure, wont take <hi>Tommy</hi> away; let Heaven be ever ſo fine a Place, I had rather ſtay here and ſtarve with you and my Papa, than go to it.—Pardon me, Gentlemen, I can't help it, (ſaus ſhe, wiping her Eyes) ſuch Senſibility and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a Child—And yet, perhaps, he is leaſt the Object of Pity, for a Day or two will, moſt probably, place him beyond the Reach of all human Evils. The Father is indeed moſt worthy of Compaſſion. Poor Man, his Countenance is the very Picture of Horror, and he looks rather like one dead than alive. Oh Heavens! what a Scene did I behold at my firſt coming into the Room! The good Creature was lying behind the Bolſter, ſupporting at once both his Child and his Wife. He had nothing on but a thin Waiſtcoat, for his Coat was ſpread over the Bed, to ſupply the Want of Blankets—When he roſe up, at my Entrance, I ſcarce knew him. As comely a Man, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi>

within this Fortnight, as you ever beheld; Mr. <hi>Nightingle</hi> had ſeen him. His Eyes ſunk, his Face pale, with a long Beard. His Body ſhivering with Cold, and worn with Hunger too; for my Couſin ſays, ſhe can hardly prevail upon him to eat.—He told me himſelf in a Whiſper—he told me—I can't repeat it—he ſaid he could not bear to eat the Bread his Children wanted. And yet, can you believe it, Gentlemen? In all this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, his Wife has as good a Cawdle as if ſhe lay in, in the midſt of the greateſt Affluence; I taſted it, and I ſcarce ever taſted better—The Means of procuring her this,' he ſaid, he believed was ſent him by an Angel from Heaven; I know not what he meant, for I had not Spirits enough to aſk a ſingle Queſtion.'</q>

Nay, the very Children, the youngeſt, which is not two Years old, excepted, feel in the ſame Manner; for they are a moſt loving Family; and if they had but a bare Competency, would be the happieſt People in the World.

But I am ſo far from deſiring to exhibit ſuch Pictures to the Public, that I would wiſh to draw a Curtain over thoſe that have been lately ſet forth in certain <hi>French</hi> Novels; very bungling Copies of which have been preſented us here, under the Name of Tranſlations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> grew ſtill more and more impatient to ſee <hi>Sophia;</hi> and finding, after repeated Interviews with Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> no Likelihood of obtaining this by her Means; for, on the contrary, the Lady began to treat even the Mention of the Name of <hi>Sophia</hi> with Reſentment; he reſolved to try ſome other Method. He made no Doubt but that Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> knew where his Angel was, ſo he thought it moſt likely, that ſome of her Servants ſhould be acquainted with the ſame Secret. <hi>Partridge</hi> therefore was employed to get acquainted with thoſe Servants, in order to fiſh this Secret out of them.</p>
               <p>Few Situations can be imagined more uneaſy than that to which his poor Maſter was at preſent reduced; for beſides the Difficulties he met with in diſcovering
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0618300103:52"/>
                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> beſides the Fears he had of having diſobliged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er, and the Aſſurances he had received from the Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> of the Reſolution which <hi>Sophia</hi> had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and of her having purpoſely concealed herſelf from him, which he had ſufficient Reaſon to believe might be true; he had ſtill a Difficulty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which it was not in the Power of his Miſtreſs to remove, however kind her Inclination might have been. This was the expoſing of her to be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited of all her Father's Eſtate, the almoſt inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſequence of their coming together without a Conſent, which he had no Hopes of ever obtaining.</p>
               <p>Add to all theſe the many Obligations which Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> whoſe violent Fondneſs we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; ſo that by her Means he was now become one of the beſt dreſs'd Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Town; and was not only relieved from thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Diſtreſſes we have before mentioned, but was actually raiſed to a State of Affluence, beyond what he had ever known.</p>
               <p>Now though there are many Gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their Conſciences to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the whole Fortune of a Woman, without making her any Kind of Return; yet to a Mind the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſtill to maintain the Roſes in her Cheeks; but theſe, like Flowers forced out of Seaſon by Art, had none of that lively blooming Freſhneſs with which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at the proper Time, bedecks her own Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. She had, beſides, a certain Imperfection, which renders ſome Flowers, tho' very beautiful to the Eye, very improper to be placed in a Wilderneſs of Sweets, and what above all others is moſt diſagreeable to the Breath of Love.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Jones</hi> ſaw all theſe Diſcouragements on the one Side, he felt his Obligations full as ſtrongly on the other; nor did he leſs plainly diſcern the ardent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whence theſe Obligations proceeded, the extreme Violence of which if he failed to equal, he well knew the Lady would think him ungrateful; and, what is worſe, he would have thought himſelf ſo. He knew the tacit Conſideration upon which all her Favours were conferred; and as his Neceſſity obliged him to accept them, ſo his Honour, he concluded, forced him to pay the Price. This therefore he reſolved to do, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Miſery it coſt him, and to devote himſelf to her, from that great Principle of Juſtice, by which the Laws of ſome Countries oblige a Debtor who is no otherwiſe capable of diſcharging his Debt to become the Slave of his Creditor.</p>
               <p>While he was meditating on theſe Matters, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the following Note from the Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'A very fooliſh, but a very perverſe Accident hath happened ſince our laſt Meeting, which makes it improper I ſhould ſee you any more at the uſual Place. I will, if poſſible, contrive ſome other Place by To-morrow. In the mean Time, Adieu.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſappointment, perhaps, the Reader may conclude was not very great; but if it was, he was quickly relieved; for in leſs than an Hour afterwards another Note was brought him from the ſame Hand, which contained as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0618300103:54"/>
                  <q rend="inline">'I have altered my Mind ſince I wrote, a Change, which if you are no Stranger to the tendereſt of all Paſſions, you will not wonder at. I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſee you this Evening, at my own Houſe, whatever may be the Conſequence. Come to me exactly at ſeven; I dine abroad, but will be at Home by that Time. A Day, I find, to thoſe that ſincerely love ſeems longer than I imagined.'</q>

               </p>
               <p>To confeſs the Truth, <hi>Jones</hi> was leſs pleaſed with this laſt Epiſtle than he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from complying with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Entreaties of Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> with whom he had now contracted much Intimacy and Friendſhip. Theſe Entreaties were to go with that young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his Company to a new Play, which was to be acted that Evening, and which a very large Party had agreed to damn, from ſome Diſlike they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Author, who was a Friend to one of Mr. <hi>Nightingale'</hi>s Acquaintance. And this Sort of Funn, our Heroe, we are aſhamed to confeſs, would willingly have preferred to the above kind Appointment; but his Honour got the better of his Inclination.</p>
               <p>Before we attend him to this intended Interview with the Lady, we think proper to account for both the preceding Notes, as the Reader may poſſibly be not a little ſurprized at the Imprudence of Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton</hi> in bringing her Lover to the very Houſe where her Rival was lodged.</p>
               <p>Firſt then the Miſtreſs of the Houſe where theſe Lovers had hitherto met, and who had been for ſome Years a Penſioner to that Lady, was now become a Methodiſt, and had that very Morning waited upon her Ladyſhip, and after rebuking her ſeverely for her paſt Life, had poſitively declared, that ſhe would,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0618300103:55"/>
on no Account, be inſtrumental in carrying on any of her Affairs for the future.</p>
               <p>The Hurry of Spirits into which this Accident threw the Lady, made her deſpair of poſſibly finding any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Convenience to meet <hi>Jones</hi> that Evening; but as ſhe began a little to recover from her Uneaſineſs at the Diſappointment, ſhe ſet her Thoughts to work, when luckily it came into her Head to propoſe to <hi>Sophia</hi> to go to the Play, which was immediately conſented to, and a proper Lady provided for her Companion. Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> was likewiſe diſpatched with Mrs. <hi>Etoff</hi> on the ſame Errand of Pleaſure; and thus her own Houſe was left free for the ſafe Reception of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> with whom ſhe promiſed herſelf two or three Hours of uninterrupted Converſation, after her Return from the Place where ſhe dined, which was at a Friend's Houſe in a pretty diſtant Part of the Town, near her old Place of Aſſignation, where ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged herſelf before ſhe was well apprized of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution that had happened in the Mind and Morals of her late Confidante.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Jones</hi> was juſt dreſs'd to wait on Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton,</hi> when Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> rapp'd at his Door; and being admitted, very earneſtly deſired his Company below Stairs to drink Tea in the Parlour.</p>
               <p>Upon his Entrance into the Room, ſhe preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a Perſon to him, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'This, Sir, is my Couſin, who hath been ſo greatly beholden to your Goodneſs, for which he begs to return you his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt Thanks.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Man had ſcarce entered upon that Speech, which Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> had ſo kindly prefaced, when both <hi>Jones</hi> and he looking ſtedfaſtly at each other, ſhowed

at once the utmoſt Tokens of Surprize. The Voice of the latter began inſtantly to faulter; and, inſtead of finiſhing his Speech, he ſunk down into a Chair, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="inline">'It is ſo, I am convinced it is ſo!'</q>

               <p>

If any Perſon had ever a Right to the Pleaſure you mention, I am convinced it is yourſelf. My Couſin tells me, ſhe acquainted you with the Diſtreſs in which ſhe found us. That, Sir, is all greatly removed, and chiefly by your Goodneſs.—My Children have now a Bed to lie on,—and they have—they have—eternal Bleſſings reward you for it,—they have Bread to eat. My little Boy is recovered; my Wife is out of Danger, and I am happy. All, all owing to you, Sir, and to my Couſin here, one of the beſt of Women. Indeed, Sir, I muſt ſee you at my Houſe.—Indeed my Wife muſt ſee you, and thank you.—My Children too muſt expreſs their Gratitude.—Indeed, Sir, they are not without a Senſe of their Obligation; but what is my Feeling when I reflect to whom I owe, that they are now capable of expreſſing their Gratitude.—Oh, Sir! the little Hearts which you have warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had now been cold as Ice without your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.—'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Jones</hi> attempted to prevent the poor Man from proceeding; but indeed the Overflowing of his own Heart would of itſelf have ſtopped his Words. And now Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> likewiſe began to pour forth Thankſgivings, as well in her own Name, as in that of her Couſin, and concluded with ſaying, ſhe doubted not but ſuch Goodneſs would meet a glorious Reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered, <q rend="inline">'He had been ſufficiently reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already. Your Couſin's Account, Madam, ſaid he, hath given me a Senſation more pleaſing than I have ever known. He muſt be a Wretch who
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0618300103:58"/>
is unmoved at hearing ſuch a Story; how tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then muſt be the Thought of having happily acted a Part in this Scene. If there are Men who cannot feel the Delight of giving Happineſs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I ſincerely pity them, as they are incapable of taſting what is in my Opinion, a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a higher Intereſt, and a ſweeter Pleaſure, than the ambitious, the avaritious, or the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man can ever obtain.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Hour of Appointment being now come, <hi>Jones</hi> was forced to take a haſty Leave, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had heartily ſhaken his Friend by the Hand, and deſired to ſee him again as ſoon as poſſible; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, that he would himſelf take the firſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of viſiting him at his own Houſe. He then ſtept into his Chair, and proceeded to Lady <hi>Bellaſton'</hi>s, greatly exulting in the Happineſs which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to this poor Family; nor could he forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting without Horror on the dreadful Conſequences which muſt have attended them, had he liſtened ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Voice of ſtrict Juſtice, than to that of Mercy when he was attacked on the high Road.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> ſung forth the Praiſes of <hi>Jones</hi> during the whole Evening, in which Mr. <hi>Enderſon,</hi> while he ſtayed, ſo paſſionately accompanied her, that he was often on the very Point of mentioning the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Robbery. However, he luckily recalled himſelf, and avoided an Indiſcretion which would have been ſo much the greater, as he knew Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> to be extremely ſtrict and nice in her Principles. He was likewiſe well appriſed of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity of this Lady; and yet ſuch was his Gratitude, that it had almoſt got the better both of Diſcretion and Shame, and made him publiſh that which would have defamed his own Character, rather than omit any Circumſtances which might do the fulleſt Honour to his Benefactor.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Jones</hi> was rather earlier than the Time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and earlier than the Lady, whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival was hindered not only by the Diſtance of the Place where ſhe dined, but by ſome other croſs Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, very vexatious to one in her Situation of Mind. He was accordingly ſhewn into the Drawing-Room, where he had not been many Minutes before the Door opened, and in came—no other than <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> herſelf, who had left the Play before the End of the firſt Act; for this, as we have already ſaid, being a new Play, at which two large Parties met, the one to damn, and the other to applaud, a violent Uproar, and an Engagement between the two Parties had ſo terrified our Heroine, that ſhe was glad to put herſelf under the Protection of a young Gentleman, who ſafely conveyed her to her Chair.</p>
               <p>As Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> had acquainted her that ſhe ſhould not be at Home till late, <hi>Sophia</hi> expecting to find no one in the Room, came haſtily in, and went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to a Glaſs which almoſt fronted her, without once looking towards the upper End of the Room, where the Statue of <hi>Jones</hi> now ſtood motionleſs.—In this Glaſs it was, after contemplating her own love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Face, that ſhe firſt diſcovered the ſaid Statue; when inſtantly turning about, ſhe perceived the Reality of the Viſion: Upon which ſhe gave a violent Scream, and ſcarce preſerved herſelf from fainting, till <hi>Jones</hi> was able to move to her, and ſupport her in his Arms.</p>
               <p>To paint the Looks or Thoughts of either of theſe Lovers is beyond my Power. As their Senſations, from their mutual Silence, may be judged to have been too big for their Utterance, it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0618300103:60"/>
that I ſhould be able to expreſs them: And the Misfortune is, that few of my Readers have been enough in Love, to feel by their own Hearts what paſt at this Time in theirs.</p>
               <p>After a ſhort Pauſe, <hi>Jones,</hi> with faultering Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, ſaid,—<q rend="inline">'I ſee, Madam, you are ſurprized.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Surprized! anſwered ſhe; Oh Heavens!

                  <q rend="inline">'Of me?' anſwered <hi>Sophia:</hi> 'Hath Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> then any ſuch important Buſineſs with me?'</q>

                  <hi>Sophia</hi> took the Pocket-Book, and was going to ſpeak, when he interrupted her, thus;—<q rend="inline">'Let us not, I beſeech you, loſe one of theſe precious Moments which For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath ſo kindly ſent us.—O my <hi>Sophia,</hi> I have Buſineſs of a much ſuperior Kind.—Thus, on my Knees, let me aſk your Pardon.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'My Pardon?' cries ſhe;—'Sure, Sir, after what is paſt you cannot expect, after what I have heard'</q>—<q rend="inline">'I ſcarce know what I ſay, anſwered <hi>Jones.</hi> 'By Heavens!

               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> ſtood trembling all this while. Her Face was whiter than Snow, and her Heart was throbbing through her Stays. But at the mention of <hi>Upton,</hi> a Bluſh aroſe in her Cheeks, and her Eyes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had ſcarce lifted up, were turned upon <hi>Jones</hi> with a Glance of Diſdain. He underſtood this ſilent Reproach, and replied to it thus: <q rend="inline">'O my <hi>Sophia,</hi> my only Love, you cannot hate or deſpiſe me more for what happened there, than I do myſelf: But yet do me the Juſtice to think, that my <hi>Heart</hi> was never unfaithful to you. <hi>That</hi> had no Share in the Folly I was guilty of; it was even then unalterably yours.

But if my Heart had not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, ſhe, into whoſe Company I accidentally fell at that curſed Place, was not an Object of ſerious Love. Believe me, my Angel, I never have ſeen her from that Day to this; and never intend, or deſired to ſee her again.'</q> 
                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> in her Heart, was very glad to hear this; but forcing into her Face an Air of more Coldneſs than ſhe yet had aſſumed; Why, ſaid ſhe, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> do you take the <q rend="inline">'Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a Defence, where you are not accuſed? If I thought it worth while to accuſe you, I have a Charge of an unpardonable Nature indeed.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What is it, for Heaven's Sake?'</q> anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> trembling and pale, expecting to hear of his Amour with Lady <hi>Bellaſton.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh, ſaid ſhe, how is it poſſible! Can every Thing noble, and every Thing baſe, be lodged together in the ſame Boſom?'</q> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> and the ignominious Circumſtance of having been <hi>kept,</hi> roſe again in his Mind, and ſtopt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0618300103:62"/>
his Mouth from any Reply. <q rend="inline">'Could I have expected, proceeded <hi>Sophia,</hi> ſuch Treatment from you? Nay, from any Gentleman, from any Man of Honour? To have my Name traduced in Public; in Inns, among the meaneſt Vulgar! To have any little Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that my unguarded Heart may have too lightly betray'd me to grant, boaſted of there! Nay, even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my Love!'</q> Nothing could equal <hi>Jones'</hi>s Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at theſe Words of <hi>Sophia;</hi> but yet, not being guilty, he was much leſs embarraſſed how to defend himſelf, than if ſhe had touched that tender String, at which his Conſcience had been alarmed. By ſome Examination he preſently found, that her ſuppoſing him guilty of ſo ſhocking an Outrage againſt his Love, and her Reputation, was entirely owing to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge'</hi>s Talk at the Inns, before Landlords and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for <hi>Sophia</hi> confeſſed to him, it was from them that ſhe received her Intelligence. He had no very great Difficulty to make her believe that he was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent of an Offence ſo foreign to his Character; but ſhe had a great deal to hinder him from going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly home, and putting <hi>Partridge</hi> to Death, which he more than once ſwore he would do. This Point being cleared up, they ſoon found themſelves ſo well pleaſed with each other, that <hi>Jones</hi> quite forgot he had begun the Converſation with conjuring her to give up all Thoughts of him; and ſhe was in a Temper to have given Ear to a Petition of a very different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For before they were aware, they had both gone ſo far, that he let fall ſome Words that ſounded like a Propoſal of Marriage. To which ſhe replied, <q rend="inline">'That, did not her Duty to her Father forbid her to follow her own Inclinations, Ruin with him would be more welcome to her, than the moſt affluent Fortune with another Man.'</q> At the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word Ruin he ſtarted, let drop her Hand,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0618300103:63"/>
which he had held for ſome Time, and ſtriking his Breaſt with his own, cried out, <q rend="inline">'Oh, <hi>Sophia,</hi> can I then ruin thee? No; by Heavens, no! I never will act ſo baſe a Part. Deareſt <hi>Sophia,</hi> whatever it coſts me, I will renounce you; I will give you up: I will tear all ſuch Hopes from my Heart, as are inconſiſtent with your real Good. My Love I will ever retain, but it ſhall be in Silence; it ſhall be at a Diſtance from you; it ſhall be in ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Land; from whence no Voice, no Sigh of my Deſpair, ſhall ever reach and diſturb your Ears. And when I am dead'</q>—He would have gone on, but was ſtopt by a Flood of Tears which <hi>Sophia</hi> let fall in his Boſom, upon which ſhe leaned, without being able to ſpeak one Word. He kiſſed them off, which, for ſome Moments, ſhe allowed him to do without any Reſiſtance; but then recollecting herſelf, gently withdrew out of his Arms; and, to turn the Diſcourſe from a Subject too tender, and which ſhe found ſhe could not ſupport, bethought herſelf to aſk him a Queſtion ſhe had never had Time to put to him before, <q rend="inline">'How he came into that Room?'</q> He begun to ſtammer, and would, in all Probability, have raiſed her Suſpicions by the Anſwer he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give, when, at once, the Door opened, and in came Lady <hi>Bellaſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having advanced a few Steps, and ſeeing <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Sophia</hi> together, ſhe ſuddenly ſtopt; when after a Pauſe of a few Moments, recollecting herſelf with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Preſence of Mind, ſhe ſaid,—tho' with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Indications of Surprize both in Voice and Countenance—<q rend="inline">'I thought, Miſs <hi>Weſtern,</hi> you had been at the Play?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Sophia</hi> had had no Opportunity of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jones,</hi> by what Means he had diſcovered her, yet as ſhe had not the leaſt Suſpicion of the real Truth, or that <hi>Jones</hi> and Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0618300103:64"/>
ſo ſhe was very little confounded: And the leſs, as the Lady had, in all their Converſations on the Subject, entirely taken her Side againſt her Father. With very little Heſitation, therefore, ſhe went through the whole Story of what had happened at the Playhouſe, and the Cauſe of her haſty Return.</p>
               <p>The Length of this Narrative gave Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> an Opportunity of rallying her Spirits, and of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in what Manner to act. And as the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of <hi>Sophia</hi> gave her Hopes that <hi>Jones</hi> had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd her, ſhe put on an Air of Good-Humour, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I ſhould not have broke in ſo abruptly upon you, Miſs <hi>Weſtern,</hi> if I had known you had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> fixed her Eyes on <hi>Sophia</hi> whilſt ſhe ſpoke theſe Words. To which that poor young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, having her Face overſpread with Bluſhes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, anſwered, in a ſtammering Voice, <q rend="inline">'I am ſure, Madam, I ſhall always think the Honour of your Ladyſhip's Company.</q>—<q rend="inline">'I hope, at leaſt,' cries Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> 'I interrupt no Buſineſs.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'No, Madam, anſwered <hi>Sophia,</hi> our Buſineſs was at an End. Your Ladyſhip may be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I have often mentioned the Loſs of my Pocket-Book, which this Gentleman having very luckily found, was ſo kind to return to me with the Bill in it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> ever ſince the Arrival of Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> had been ready to ſink with Fear. He ſat kicking his Heels, playing with his Fingers, and looking more like a Fool, if it be poſſible, than a young boody Squire, when he is firſt introduced into a polite Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. He began, however, now to recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and taking a Hint from the Behaviour of Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> who, he ſaw, did not intend to claim any Acquaintance with him, he reſolved as entirely to affect the Stranger on his Part. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Ever ſince
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0618300103:65"/>
he had had the Pocket-Book in his Poſſeſſion, he had uſed great Diligence in enquiring out the Lady whoſe Name was writ in it; but never till that Day could be ſo fortunate to diſcover her.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> had, indeed, mentioned the Loſs of her Pocket-Book to Lady <hi>Bellaſton;</hi> but as <hi>Jones,</hi> for ſome Reaſon or other, had never once hinted to her that it was in his Poſſeſſion, ſhe believed not one Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of what <hi>Sophia</hi> now ſaid, and wonderfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the extreme Quickneſs of the young Lady, in inventing ſuch an Excuſe. The Reaſon of <hi>Sophia'</hi>s leaving the Play-houſe met with no better Credit; and though ſhe could not account for the Meeting between theſe two Lovers, ſhe was firmly perſwaded it was not accidental.</p>
               <p>With an affected Smile, therefore, ſhe ſaid—<q rend="inline">'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Miſs <hi>Weſtern,</hi> you have had very good Luck in recovering your Money. Not only as it fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of a Gentleman of Honour, but as he happened to diſcover to whom it belonged. I think you would not conſent to have it advertiſed.—It was great good Fortune, Sir, that you found out to whom the Note belonged.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'O Madam, cries <hi>Jones,</hi> it was incloſed in a Pocket-Book, in which the young Lady's Name was written.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'That was very fortunate indeed, cries the Lady;—And it was no leſs ſo, that you heard Miſs <hi>Weſtern</hi> was at my Houſe; for ſhe is very little known.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had at length perfectly recovered his Spirits; and as he conceived he had now an Opportunity of ſatisfying <hi>Sophia,</hi> as to the Queſtion ſhe had aſked him juſt before Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> came in, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus: Why, Madam, anſwered he, <q rend="inline">'it was by the luckieſt Chance imaginable I made this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. I was mentioning what I had found, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0618300103:66"/>
the Name of the Owner, the other Night, to a Lady at the Maſquerade, who told me, ſhe believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe knew where I might ſee Miſs <hi>Weſtern;</hi> and if I would come to her Houſe the next Morning, ſhe would inform me. I went according to her Appointment, but ſhe was not at Home; nor could I ever meet with her till this Morning, when ſhe directed me to your Ladyſhip's Houſe. I came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and did myſelf the Honour to aſk for your Ladyſhip; and upon my ſaying that I had very particular Buſineſs, a Servant ſhewed me into this Room; where I had not been long before the young Lady returned from the Play.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon his mentioning the Maſquerade, he look'd very ſlyly at Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> without any Fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarked by <hi>Sophia;</hi> for ſhe was viſibly too much confounded to make any Obſervations. This Hint a little alarmed the Lady, and ſhe was ſilent; when <hi>Jones,</hi> who ſaw the Agitations of <hi>Sophia'</hi>s Mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take the only Method of relieving her, which was by retiring: But before he did this, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I believe, Madam, it is cuſtomary to give ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on theſe Occaſions;—I muſt inſiſt on a very high one for my Honeſty;—It is, Madam, no leſs than the Honour of being permitted to pay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Viſit here.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir, replied the Lady, I make no Doubt that you are a Gentleman, and my Doors are never ſhut to People of Faſhion.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> then, after proper Ceremonials, departed, highly to his own Satisfaction, and no leſs to that of <hi>Sophia;</hi> who was terribly alarmed leſt Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> ſhould diſcover what ſhe knew already but too well.</p>
               <p>Upon the Stairs <hi>Jones</hi> met his old Acquaintance Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> who, notwithſtanding all ſhe had ſaid againſt him, was now ſo well-bred to behave with great Civility. This Meeting proved indeed a lucky

               <p>And ſurely there are no Perſons who may ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly challenge a Right to this commendable Deviation from Truth, as young Women in the Affair of Love; for which they may plead Precept, Education, and above all, the Sanction, nay, I may ſay, the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Cuſtom, by which they are reſtrained, not from ſubmitting to the honeſt Impulſes of Nature (for that would be a fooliſh Prohibition) but from owning them.</p>

               <p>AS ſeveral Gentlemen in theſe Times, by the wonderful Force of Genius only, without the leaſt Aſſiſtance of Learning, perhaps, without being well able to read, have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Figure in the Republic of Letters; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Critics, I am told, have lately begun to aſſert, that all kind of Learning is entirely uſeleſs to a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, indeed, no other than a kind of Fetters on the natural Spritelineſs and Activity on the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is thus weighed down, and prevented
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0618300103:72"/>
from ſoaring to thoſe high Flights which otherwiſe it would be able to reach.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine, I am afraid, is, at preſent, carried much too far: For why ſhould Writing differ ſo much from all other Arts? The Nimbleneſs of a Dancing-Maſter is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move; nor doth any Mechanic, I believe, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Tools the worſe by knowing how to uſe them. For my own Part, I cannot conceive that <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> would have writ with more Fire, if, inſtead of being Maſters of all the Learning of their Times, they had really been as ignorant as moſt of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the preſent Age. Nor do I believe that all the Imagination, Fire, and Judgment of <hi>Pitt</hi> could have produced thoſe Orations that have made the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>England</hi> in theſe our Times a Rival in Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> if he had not been ſo well read in the Writings of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> as to have transfuſed their whole Spirit into his Speeches, and with their Spirit, their Knowledge too.</p>
               <p>I would not here be underſtood to inſiſt on the ſame Fund of Learning in any of my Brethren, as <hi>Cicero</hi> perſwades us is neceſſary to the Compoſition of an Orator. On the contrary, very little Reading is, I conceive, neceſſary to the Poet, leſs to the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and the leaſt of all to the Politician. For the firſt, perhaps, <hi>Byſſe'</hi>s Art of Poetry, and a few of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Poets, may ſuffice; for the ſecond, a moderate Heap of Plays; and for the laſt, an indifferent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of political Journals.</p>
               <p>To ſay the Truth, I require no more than that a Man ſhould have ſome little Knowledge of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which he treats, according to the old Maxim of Law, <hi>Quam quiſque norit artem in eâ ſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat.</hi> With this alone a Writer may ſometimes do tolerably well; and indeed without this, all the other Learning in the World will ſtand him in little ſtead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0618300103:73"/>
For Inſtance, let us ſuppoſe that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero, Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> could have met all together, and have clubbed their ſeveral Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to have compoſed a Treatiſe on the Art of Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent Treatiſe which Mr. <hi>Eſſex</hi> hath given us on that Subject, entitled, <hi>The Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of genteel Education.</hi> And, indeed, ſhould the excellent Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> be prevailed on to ſet <hi>Fiſt</hi> to Paper, and to complete the aboveſaid Rudiments, by delivering down the true Principles of Athletics, I queſtion whether the World will have any Cauſe to lament, that none of the great Writers, either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern, have ever treated about that noble and uſeful Art.</p>
               <p>To avoid a Multiplicity of Examples in ſo plain a Caſe, and to come at once to my Point, I am apt to conceive, that one Reaſon why many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have totally failed in deſcribing the Manners of upper Life, may poſſibly be, that in Reality they know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>This is a Knowledge unhappily not in the Power of many Authors to arrive at. Books will give us a very imperfect Idea of it; nor will the Stage a much better: The fine Gentleman formed upon reading the former will almoſt always turn out a Pedant, and he who forms himſelf upon the latter, a Coxcomb.</p>
               <p>Nor are the Characters drawn from theſe Models better ſupported. <hi>Vanbrugh</hi> and <hi>Congreve</hi> copied Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but they who copy them draw as unlike the preſent Age, as <hi>Hogarth</hi> would do if he was to paint a Rout or a Drum in the Dreſſes of <hi>Titian</hi> and of <hi>Vandyke.</hi> In ſhort, Imitation here will not do the Buſineſs. The Picture muſt be after Nature herſelf. A true Knowledge of the World is gained only by Converſation, and the Manners of every Rank muſt be ſeen in order to be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0618300103:74"/>
Now it happens that this higher Order of Mortals is not to be ſeen, like all the reſt of the Human Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, for nothing, in the Streets, Shops, and Coffee-houſes: Nor are they ſhewn, like the upper Rank of Animals, for ſo much apiece. In ſhort, this is a Sight to which no Perſons are admitted, without one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Qualifications, <hi>viz.</hi> either Birth or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; or what is equivalent to both, the honourable Profeſſion of a Gameſter. And very unluckily for the World, Perſons ſo qualified, very ſeldom care to take upon themſelves the bad Trade of Writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer Sort, as it is a Trade which many think re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no Kind of Stock to ſet up with.</p>
               <p>Hence thoſe ſtrange Monſters in Lace and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, in Silks and Brocades, with vaſt Wigs and Hoops; which, under the Name of Lords and Ladies, ſtrut the Stage, to the great Delight of Attornies and their Clerks in the Pit, and of Citizens and their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices in the Galleries; and which are no more to be found in real Life, than the Centaur, the Chimera, or any other Creature of mere Fiction. But to let my Reader into a Secret, this Knowledge of upper Life, though very neceſſary for the preventing Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, is no very great Reſource to a Writer whoſe Province is Comedy, or that Kind of Novels, which like this I am writing, is of the comic Claſs.</p>
               <p>What Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſays of Women is very applicable to moſt in this Station, who are indeed ſo entirely made up of Form and Affection, that they have no Character at all, at leaſt, none which appears. I will venture to ſay the higheſt Life is much the dulleſt, and affords very little Humour or Entertainment. The various Callings in lower Spheres produce the great Variety of humorous Characters; whereas here, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept among the few who are engaged in the Purſuit of Ambition, and the fewer ſtill who have a Reliſh for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0618300103:75"/>
Pleaſure, all is Vanity and ſervile Imitation. Dreſſing and Cards, eating and drinking, bowing and curteſying, make up the Buſineſs of their Lives.</p>
               <p>Some there are however of this Rank, upon whom Paſſion exerciſes its Tyranny, and hurries them far beyond the Bounds which Decorum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes; of theſe, the Ladies are as much diſtinguiſhed by their noble Intrepidity, and a certain ſuperior Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Reputation, from the frail ones of meaner Degree, as a virtuous Woman of Quality is by the Elegance and Delicacy of her Sentiments from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Wife of a Yeoman or Shopkeeper. Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton</hi> was of this intrepid Character; but let not my Country Readers conclude from her, that this is the general Conduct of Women of Faſhion, or that we mean to repreſent them as ſuch. They might as well ſuppoſe, that every Clergyman was repreſented by <hi>Thwackum,</hi> or every Soldier by Enſign <hi>Northerton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not indeed a greater Error than that which univerſally prevails among the Vulgar, who borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Opinion from ſome ignorant Satyriſts, have affixed the Character of Lewdneſs to theſe Times. On the contrary, I am convinced there never was leſs of Love Intrigue carried on among Perſons of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than now. Our preſent Women have been taught by their Mothers to fix their Thoughts only on Ambition and Vanity, and to deſpiſe the Pleaſures of Love as unworthy their Regard; and being afterwards, by the Care of ſuch Mothers, married without having Huſbands, they ſeem pretty well confirmed in the Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Sentiments; whence they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the dull Remainder of Life, with the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of more innocent, but I am afraid more childiſh Amuſements, the bare Mention of which would ill ſuit with the Dignity of this Hiſtory. In my humble Opinion, the true Characteriſtick of the preſent <hi>Beau</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0618300103:76"/>
                  <hi>Monde,</hi> is rather Folly than Vice, and the only Epithet which it deſerves is that of <hi>Frivolous.</hi>

He then returned a thouſand Thanks to his dear <hi>Sophia</hi> in a Whiſper, and begged her to leave him to read her Letter; ſhe preſently departed, not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing much grateful Senſe of his Generoſity.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> now came from behind the Curtain. How ſhall I deſcribe her Rage? Her Tongue was at firſt incapable of Utterance; but ſtreams of Fire dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her Eyes, and well indeed they might, for her Heart was all in a Flame. And now as ſoon as her Voice found Way, inſtead of expreſſing any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt <hi>Honour,</hi> or her own Servants, ſhe began to attack poor <hi>Jones.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You ſee, ſaid ſhe, what I have ſacrificed to you, my Reputation, my Honour,—gone for ever! And what Return have I found?

Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent Girl to you, what Security could you have,

that I ſhould not act the ſame Part by yourſelf? A Moment's Reflection will, I am ſure, convince you, that a Man with whom the Secrets of a Lady are not ſafe, muſt be the moſt contemptible of Wretches. Very well, ſaid ſhe—I need not inſiſt on your becoming this contemptible Wretch in your own Opinion; for the Inſide of the Letter could inform me of nothing more than I know already. I ſee the Footing you are upon.'</q>—Here enſued a long Converſation, which the Reader, who is not too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, will thank me for not inſerting at length.

And theſe Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> having expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great Deſire and Curioſity to hear, he began and related to her his whole Hiſtory, without once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Name of <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Kind of Sympathy in honeſt Minds, by Means of which they give an eaſy Credit to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> believed all which <hi>Jones</hi> told her to be true, and expreſt much pity and Concern for him. She was beginning to comment on the Story, but <hi>Jones</hi> interrupted her: For as the Hour of Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation now drew nigh, he began to ſtipulate for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Interview with the Lady that Evening, which he promiſed ſhould be the laſt at her Houſe; ſwearing, at the ſame Time, that ſhe was one of great Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that nothing but what was entirely innocent was to paſs between them; and I do firmly believe he intended to keep his Word.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> was at length prevailed on, and <hi>Jones</hi> departed to his Chamber, where he ſat alone till Twelve o'Clock, but no Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> appeared.</p>
               <p>As we have ſaid that this Lady had a great Affection for <hi>Jones,</hi> and as it muſt have appeared that ſhe really had ſo, the Reader may perhaps wonder at the firſt Failure of her Appointment, as ſhe apprehended him
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0618300103:97"/>
to be confined by Sickneſs, a Seaſon when Friendſhip ſeems moſt to require ſuch Viſits. This Behaviour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Lady, may, by ſome, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our Fault; for our Buſineſs is only to record Truth.</p>

of this Kind, you will give me leave to examine it. Can you, with Honour, be guilty of having, under falſe Pretences, deceived a young Woman and her Family, and of having, by theſe Means, treacherouſly robbed her of her Innocence?

Can Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour bear the Thought, that this Creature is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, helpleſs, defenceleſs young Woman? A young Woman who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who hath placed the utmoſt Confidence in your Promiſes; and to that Confidence hath ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed every Thing which is dear to her?

And what is this World, which you would be aſhamed to face, but the Vile, the Fooliſh, and the Profligate? Forgive me, if I ſay ſuch a Shame muſt proceed from falſe Modeſty, which always attends falſe Honour as its Shadow.—But I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there is not a Man of real Senſe and Goodneſs in the World, who would not honour and applaud the Action.

On the one Side, ſee this poor, unhappy, tender, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Girl, in the Arms of her wretched Mother, breathing her laſt. Hear her breaking Heart in Agonies ſighing out your Name; and lamenting, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than accuſing, the Cruelty which weighs her down to Deſtruction. Paint to your Imagination the Circumſtances of her fond, deſpairing Parent, driven to Madneſs, or, perhaps, to Death, by the Loſs of her lovely Daughter. View the poor, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Orphan-Infant: And when your Mind hath dwelt a Moment only on ſuch Ideas, conſider your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the Cauſe of all; the Ruin of this poor, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, worthy, defenceleſs Family. On the other Side, conſider yourſelf as relieving them from their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Sufferings. Think with what Joy, with what Tranſports, that lovely Creature will fly to your Arms. See her Blood returning to her pale Cheeks, her Fire to her languid Eyes, and Raptures to her tortured Breaſt. Conſider the Exultations of her Mother, the Happineſs of all. Think of this little Family made, by one Act of yours, complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy. Think of this Alternative, and ſure I am miſtaken in my Friend, if it requires any long Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, whether he will ſink theſe Wretches down for ever, or, by one generous, noble Reſolution, raiſe them all from the Brink of Miſery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, to the higheſt Pitch of human Happineſs. Add to this but one Conſideration more; the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it is your Duty ſo to do—That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery from which you will relieve theſe poor People, is the Miſery which you yourſelf have wilfully brought upon them.'</q>

Nay, believe me, I had many Struggles with my Paſſion, before I could prevail with myſelf to write that cruel Letter, which hath cauſed all the Miſery in that unhappy Family. If I had no Inclinations to conſult but my own, I would marry her Tomorrow Morning; I would, by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but you will eaſily imagine how impoſſible it would be to prevail on my Father to conſent to ſuch a Match; beſides, he hath provided another for me; and Tomorrow, by his expreſs Command, I am to wait on the Lady.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I have not the Honour to know your Father,' ſaid <hi>Jones;</hi> 'but ſuppoſe he could be perſuaded, would you yourſelf conſent to the only Means of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe poor People?' 'As eagerly as I would purſue my Happineſs,' anſwered <hi>Nightingale;</hi> 'for I never ſhall find it in any other Woman.—O my dear Friend, could you imagine what I have felt within theſe twelve Hours for my poor Girl, I am convinced ſhe would not engroſs all your Pity. Paſſion leads me only to her; and if I had any fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Scruples of Honour, you have fully ſatisfied them: Could my Father be induced to comply with my Deſires, nothing would be wanting to compleat my own Happineſs, or that of my <hi>Nancy.</hi>'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Then I am reſolved to undertake it,' ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 'You muſt not be angry with me, in whatever Light it may be neceſſary to ſet this Affair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwiſe be long hid from him; for Things of this Nature make a quick Progreſs, when once they get abroad, as this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily hath already.

If you will therefore tell me where I may find the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I will not looſe a Moment in the Buſineſs; which while I purſue, you cannot do a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Action, than by paying a Viſit to the poor Girl.

               <p>
                  <hi>Nightingale</hi> immediately conſented to the Propoſal; and now having acquainted <hi>Jones</hi> with his Father's Lodging, and the Coffee-houſe where he would moſt probably find him, he heſitated a Moment, and then ſaid, <q rend="inline">'My dear <hi>Tom,</hi> you are going to undertake an Impoſſibility. If you knew my Father, you would never think of obtaining his Conſent.—Stay, there is one Way—Suppoſe you told him I was already married, it might be eaſier to reconcile him to the Fact after it was done; and, upon my Honour, I am ſo affected with what you have ſaid, and I love my <hi>Nancy</hi> ſo paſſionately, I almoſt wiſh it was done, whatever might be the Conſequence.'</q>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>What paſſed between</hi> Jones <hi>and old Mr.</hi> Nightingale, <hi>with the Arrival of a Perſon not yet mentioned in this Hiſtory.</hi>

               <p>NOtwithſtanding the Sentiment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſt, which denies the Divinity of Fortune; and the Opinion of <hi>Seneca</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe; <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> who was, I believe, a wiſer Man than either of them, expreſly holds the contrary; and certain it is there are ſome Incidents in Life ſo very ſtrange and unaccountable, that it ſeems to require more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Skill and Foreſight in producing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0618300103:110"/>
Of this Kind was what now happened to <hi>Jones,</hi> who found Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> the elder in ſo critical a Minute, that Fortune, if ſhe was really worthy all the Worſhip ſhe received at <hi>Rome,</hi> could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived ſuch another. In ſhort the old Gentleman and the Father of the young Lady whom he intended for his Son, had been hard at it for many Hours; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atter was juſt now gone, and had left the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Thoughts that he had ſucceeded in a long Contention which had been between the two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the future Bride and Bridegroom; in which both endeavoured to over-reach the other, and as not rarely happens in ſuch Caſes, both had retreated fully ſatisfied of having obtained the Victory.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman whom Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> now viſited, was what they call a Man of the World, that is to ſay, a Man who directs his Conduct in this World, as one who being fully perſuaded there is no other, as reſolved to make the moſt of this. In his early Years he had been bred to Trade, but having acquired a very good Fortune, he had lately declined his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or to ſpeak more properly, had changed it from dealing in Goods to dealing only in Money, of which he had always a plentiful Fund at Command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful Advantage; ſometimes of the Neceſſities of private Men, and ſometimes thoſe of the Public. He had indeed converſed ſo entirely with Money, that it may be almoſt doubted, whether he imagined there was any other thing really exiſting in the World; this at leaſt may be certainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing elſe to have any real Value.</p>
               <p>The Reader will, I fancy, allow, that Fortune could not have culled out a more improper Perſon for Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to attack with any Probability of Succeſs, nor could the whimſical Lady have directed this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack at a more unſeaſonable Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0618300103:111"/>
As Money then was always uppermoſt in this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Thoughts, ſo the Moment he ſaw a Stranger within his Doors, it immediately occurred to his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that ſuch Stranger was either come to bring him Money, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of theſe Thoughts prevailed, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a favourable or unfavourable Idea of the Perſon who approached him.</p>
               <p>Unluckily for <hi>Jones,</hi> the latter of theſe was the Aſcendant at preſent; for as a young Gentleman had viſited him the Day before, with a Bill from his Son for a Play Debt, he apprehended at the firſt Sight of <hi>Jones,</hi> that he was come on ſuch another Errand. <hi>Jones</hi> therefore had no ſooner told him that he was come on his Son's Account, than the old Gentleman, being confirmed in his Suſpicion, burſt forth into an Exclamation, 'That he would loſe his Labour.' <q rend="inline">'Is it then poſſible, Sir,' anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> 'that you can gueſs my Buſineſs?' If I do gueſs it, replied the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I repeat again to you, you will loſe your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. What, I ſuppoſe you are one of thoſe Sparks who lead my Son into all thoſe Scenes of Riot and Debauchery, which will be his Deſtruction; but I ſhall pay no more of his Bills I promiſe you. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he will quit all ſuch Company for the future. If I had imagined otherwiſe I ſhould not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Wife for him; for I would be inſtrumental in the Ruin of no Body.' 'How, Sir, ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> and was this Lady of your providing?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Pray Sir,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the old Gentleman, 'how comes it to be any Concern of yours?'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Nay, dear Sir,' replied <hi>Jones,</hi> 'be not offended that I intereſt myſelf in what regards your Son's Happineſs, for whom I have ſo great an Honour and Value. It was upon that very Account I came to wait upon you. I can't expreſs the Satisfaction you have given me by what you ſay for I do aſſure you your Son is a Perſon for whom
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0618300103:112"/>
I have the higheſt Honour.—Nay, Sir, it is not eaſy to expreſs the Eſteem I have for you, who could be ſo generous, ſo good, ſo kind, ſo indulgent to provide ſuch a Match for your Son; a Woman who, I dare ſwear, will make him one of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Men upon Earth.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any thing which ſo happily introduces Men to our good Liking, as having conceived ſome Alarm at their firſt Appearance; when once thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions begin to vaniſh, we ſoon forget the Fears which they occaſion, and look on ourſelves as indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our preſent Eaſe, to thoſe very Perſons who at firſt rais'd our Fears.</p>
               <p>Thus it happened to <hi>Nightingale,</hi> who no ſooner found that <hi>Jones</hi> had no Demand on him, as he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, than he began to be pleaſed with his Preſence. <q rend="inline">'Pray, good Sir, ſaid he, be pleaſed to ſit down. I do not remember to have ever had the Pleaſure of ſeeing you before; but if you are a Friend of my Son, and have any thing to ſay concerning this young Lady, I ſhall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy, it will be his own Fault if ſhe doth not. I have diſcharged my Duty, in taking Care of the main Article. She will bring him a Fortune capable of making any reaſonable, prudent, ſober Man happy.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Undoubtedly, cries <hi>Jones,</hi> for ſhe is in herſelf a Fortune; ſo beautiful, ſo genteel, ſo ſweet-tempered, and ſo well educated; ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a moſt accompliſhed young Lady; ſings admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well, and hath a moſt delicate Hand at the Harpſichord.' 'I did not know any of theſe Matters, anſwered the old Gentleman, for I never ſaw the the Lady; but I do not like her the worſe for what you tell me; and I am the better pleaſed with her Father for not laying any Streſs on theſe Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our Bargain. I ſhall always think it a Proof of his Underſtanding. A ſilly Fellow would have

the utmoſt Satisfaction; and when the Father had very bitterly reviled his Son, and pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Beggary upon him, the Uncle began in the following Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'If you was a little cooler, Brother, I would aſk you whether you love your Son for his Sake, or for your own. You would anſwer, I ſuppoſe, and ſo I ſuppoſe you think, for his Sake; and doubtleſs it is his Happineſs which you intended in the Marriage you propoſed for him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Now, Brother, to preſcribe Rules of Happineſs to others, hath always appeared to me very abſurd, and to inſiſt on doing this very tyrannical. It is a vulgar Error I know; but it is nevertheleſs an Error. And if this be abſurd in other Things, it is moſtly ſo in the Affair of Marriage, the Happineſs of which depends entirely on the Affection which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts between the Parties.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I have therefore always thought it unreaſonable in Parents to deſire to chuſe for their Children on this Occaſion, ſince to force Affection is an impoſſible Attempt; nay, ſo much doth Love abhor Force, that I know not whether through an unfortunate but incureable Perverſeneſs in our Natures, it may not be even impatient of Perſuaſion.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'It is, however, true, that though a Parent will not, I think, wiſely preſcribe, he ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on this Occaſion, and in Strictneſs perhaps ſhould at leaſt have a negative Voice. My Nephew therefore, I own, in marrying without aſking your Advice, hath been guilty of a Fault. But honeſtly ſpeaking, Brother, have you not a little promoted this Fault? Have not your frequent Declarations on this Subject, given him a moral Certainty of your Refuſal, where there was any Deficiency in Point of Fortune? nay, doth not your preſent Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe ſolely from that Deficiency? And if he hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0618300103:117"/>
failed in his Duty here, did not you as much exceed that Authority, when you abſolutely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained with him for a Woman without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whom you yourſelf never ſaw, and whom if you had ſeen and known as well as I, it muſt have been Madneſs in you, to have ever thought of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her into your Family.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Still I own my Nephew in a Fault; but ſurely it is not an unpardonable Fault. He hath acted indeed without your Conſent, in a Matter in which he ought to have aſked it; but it is in a Matter in which his Intereſt is principally concerned; you yourſelf muſt and will acknowledge, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his Intereſt only, and if he unfortunately dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from you, and hath been miſtaken in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Happineſs, will you, Brother, if you love your Son, carry him ſtill wider from the Point? Will you encreaſe the ill Conſequences of his ſimple Choice? Will you endeavour to make an Event certain Miſery to him, which may accidentally prove ſo? In a Word, Brother, becauſe he hath put it out of your Power to make his Circumſtances as affluent as you would, will you diſtreſs them as much as you can?'</q>

               <p>THO' the Reader may have long ſince concluded Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> to be a Member (and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable one) of the Great World, ſhe was in reality a very conſiderable Member of <hi>the Little World;</hi> by which Appellation was diſtinguiſhed a very worthy and honourable Society which not long ſince flouriſhed in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Among other good Principles upon which this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was founded, was one very remarkable; for as it was a Rule of an honourable Club of Heroes, who aſſembled at the cloſe of the late War, that all the Members ſhould every Day fight once at leaſt; ſo 'twas in this, that every Member ſhould, within the twenty four Hours, tell at leaſt one merry Fib, which was to be propagated by all the Brethren and Siſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>Many idle Stories were told about this Society, which from a certain Quality may be perhaps not unjuſtly ſuppoſed to have come from the Society them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As, that the Devil was the Preſident, and that he ſat in Perſon in an elbow Chair at the upper End of the Table; but upon very ſtrict Enquiry, I find there is not the leaſt Truth in any of thoſe Tales, and that the Aſſembly conſiſted in reality of a Set of very good ſort of People, and the Fibs which they propagated were of a harmleſs Kind, and tended only to produce Mirth and good Humour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edwards</hi> was likewiſe a Member of this comical Society. To him therefore Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> applied as a proper Inſtrument for her Purpoſe, and furniſhed him with a Fib, which he was to vent whenever the Lady gave him her Cue; and this was not to be till

the Evening when all the Company but Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> and himſelf were gone, and while they were engaged in a Rubbers at Whiſt.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> then began as follows: <q rend="inline">'The Fault is not mine, Madam; It lies in the Dulneſs of the Age that doth nothing worth talking Of—O la! tho' now I think on't, there hath a terrible Accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen poor Col. <hi>Wilcox.—</hi>Poor <hi>Ned—</hi>You know him my Lord, every body knows him; faith! I am very much concerned for him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'What is it, pray?'</q> ſays Lady <hi>Bellaſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Why, he hath killed a Man this Morning in a Duel, that's all.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip, who was not in the Secret, aſked gravely, whom he had killed; to which <hi>Edwards</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q rend="inline">'A young Fellow we none of us know; a <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> Lad juſt come to town, one <hi>Jones</hi> his Name is; a near Relation of one Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> of whom your Lordſhip I believe hath heard. I ſaw the Lad lie dead in a Coffee-houſe.—Upon my Soul he is one of the fineſt Corpſes I ever ſaw in my Life.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> who juſt began to deal as <hi>Tom</hi> had menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned that a Man was killed, ſtopt her Hand, and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with Attention, (for all Stories of that Kind affected her) but no ſooner had he arrived at the latter part of the Story, than ſhe began to deal again; and having dealt three Cards to one, and ſeven to another,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0618300103:135"/>
and ten to a third, at laſt dropt the reſt from her Hand, and fell back in her Chair.</p>
               <p>The Company behaved as uſually on theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The uſual Diſturbance enſued, the uſual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was ſummoned, and <hi>Sophia</hi> at laſt, as it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, returned again to Life, and was ſoon after, at her earneſt Deſire, led to her own Apartment; where, at my Lord's Requeſt, Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> acquainted her with the Truth, attempted to carry it off as a Jeſt of her own, and comforted her with repeated Aſſurances, that neither his Lordſhip, nor <hi>Tom,</hi> though ſhe had taught him the Story, were in the true Secret of the Affair.</p>
               <p>There was no farther Evidence neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> how juſtly the Caſe had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him by Lady <hi>Bellaſton;</hi> and now at her Return into the Room, a Scheme was laid between thoſe two noble Perſons, which, though it appeared in no very heinous Light to his Lordſhip, (as he faithfully promiſed, and faithfully reſolved too, to make the Lady all the ſubſequent amends in his Power by Marriage;) yet many of our Readers, we doubt not, will ſee with juſt Deteſtation.</p>
               <p>The next Evening at ſeven was appointed for the fatal Purpoſe, when Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> undertook that <hi>Sophia</hi> ſhould be alone, and his Lordſhip ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to her. The whole Family were to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the Purpoſe, moſt of the Servants diſpatched out of the Houſe, and for Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> who, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſuſpicion, was to be left with her Miſtreſs till his Lordſhip's Arrival, Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> herſelf was to engage her in an Apartment as diſtant as poſſible from the Scene of the intended Miſchief, and out of the Hearing of <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Matters being thus agreed on, his Lordſhip took his Leave, and her Ladyſhip retired to Reſt, highly pleaſed with a Project of which ſhe had no reaſon to doubt the Succeſs, and which promiſed ſo effectually
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0618300103:136"/>
to remove <hi>Sophia</hi> from being any future Obſtruction to her Amour with <hi>Jones,</hi> by a Means of which ſhe ſhould never appear to be guilty, even if the Fact appeared to the World; but this ſhe made no doubt of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by huddling up a Marriage, to which ſhe thought the raviſhed <hi>Sophia</hi> would eaſily be brought to conſent, and at which all the reſt of her Family would rejoice.</p>
               <p>But Affairs were not in ſo quiet a Situation in the Boſom of the other Conſpirator. His Mind was toſt in all the diſtracting Anxiety ſo nobly deſcribed by <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Between the Acting of a dreadful Thing,</l>
                  <l>And the firſt Motion, all the Interim is</l>
                  <l>Like a Phantaſma, or a hideous Dream:</l>
                  <l>The Genius and the mortal Inſtruments</l>
                  <l>Are then in Council; and the State of Man,</l>

               <p>Though the Violence of his Paſſion had made him eagerly embrace the firſt Hint of this Deſign, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as it came from a Relation of the Lady, yet when that Friend to Reflection, a Pillow, had placed the Action itſelf in all its natural black Colours before his Eyes, with all the Conſequences which muſt, and thoſe which might probably attend it; his Reſolution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side; and after a long Conflict which laſted a whole Night between Honour and Appetite, the former at length prevailed, and he determined to wait on Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> and to relinquiſh the Deſign.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> was in Bed, though very late in the Morning, and <hi>Sophia</hi> ſitting by her Bedſide, when the Servant acquainted her that Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Parlour, upon which her Ladyſhip deſired him to ſtay, and that ſhe would ſee him preſently; but the Servant was no ſooner departed than poor
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0618300103:137"/>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> began to intreat her Couſin not to encourage the Viſits of that odious Lord (ſo ſhe called him though a little unjuſtly) upon her Account. <q rend="inline">'I ſee his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,' ſaid ſhe, 'for he made downright Love to me Yeſterday Morning; but as I am reſolved never to admit it, I beg your Ladyſhip not to leave us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone together any more, and to order the Servants that if he enquires for me I may be always denied to him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>'La! Child,' ſays Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'you Country Girls have nothing but Sweet-Hearts in your Head; you fancy every Man who is civil to you is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love. He is one of the moſt gallant young Fellows about Town, and I am convinced means no more than a little Gallantry. Make Love to you indeed! I wiſh with all my Heart he would, and you muſt be an arrant mad Woman to refuſe him.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'But as I ſhall certainly be that mad Woman,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'I hope his Viſits ſhall not be intruded on me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>'O Child,' ſaid Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'you need not be ſo fearful, if you reſolve to run away with that <hi>Jones,</hi> I know no Perſon who can hinder you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Upon my Honour, Madam,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'your Ladyſhip injures me. I will never run away with any Man; nor will I ever marry contrary to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Inclinations.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'Well Miſs <hi>Weſtern,'</hi> ſaid the Lady, 'if you are not in a Humour to ſee Company this Morning, you may retire to your own Apartment; for I am not frightned at his Lordſhip, and muſt ſend for him up into my Dreſſing-Room.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> thanked her Ladyſhip and withdrew; and preſently afterwards <hi>Fellamar</hi> was admitted up Stairs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>By which it will appear how dangerous an Advocate a Lady is, when ſhe applies her Eloquence to an ill Purpoſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEN Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> heard the young Lord's Scruples, ſhe treated them with the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain with which one of thoſe Sages of the Law, called <hi>Newgate</hi> Solicitors, treats the Qualms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in a young Witneſs. <q rend="inline">'My dear Lord,' ſaid ſhe, 'you certainly want a Cordial. I muſt ſend to Lady <hi>Edgely</hi> for one of her beſt Drams. Fie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it! have more Reſolution. Are you frightned by the Word Rape? Or are you apprehenſive—? Well, if the Story of <hi>Helen</hi> was modern, I ſhould think it unnatural. I mean the Behaviour of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> not the Fondneſs of the Lady; for all Women love a Man of Spirit. There is another Story of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Ladies,—and that too, I thank Heaven, is very ancient. Your Lordſhip, perhaps, will admire my Reading; but I think Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> tells us they made tolerable good Wives afterwards. I fancy few of my married Acquaintance were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed by their Huſbands.' 'Nay, dear Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton,'</hi> cried he, 'don't ridicule me in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 'Why, my good Lord,' anſwered ſhe, do you think any Woman in <hi>England</hi> would not laugh at you in her Heart whatever Prudery ſhe might wear in her Countenance?—You force me to uſe a ſtrange Kind of Language, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my Sex moſt abominably: But I am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with knowing my Intentions are good, and that I am endeavouring to ſerve my Couſin; for I think you will make her a Huſband notwithſtanding this; or, upon my Soul, I would not even perſuade her to fling herſelf away upon an empty Title.

Certain it is they ſunk deeper into his Lordſhip, than any Thing which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> could have ſaid on the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> perceiving ſhe had fired the young Lord's Pride, began now, like a true Orator, to rouſe other Paſſions to its Aſſiſtance. <q rend="inline">'My Lord,' ſaid ſhe, in a graver Voice, 'you will be pleaſed to remember you mentioned this Matter to me firſt; for I would not appear to you in the Light of one who is endeavouring to put off my Couſin upon you. Fourſcore thouſand Pounds do not ſtand in Need of an Advocate to recommend them. Nor doth Miſs <hi>Weſtern,'</hi> ſaid he, 'require any Recommendation from her Fortune; for in my Opinion, no Woman ever had half her Charms.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, yes, my Lord;' replied the Lady, looking in the Glaſs, 'there have been Women with more than half her Charms, I aſſure you; not that I need leſſen her on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

                  <q rend="inline">'Well ſpoken, my Lord,' anſwered the Lady. 'I promiſe you no Diſappointment ſhall happen from my Side; and within this Week I am convinced I ſhall call your Lordſhip my Couſin in Public.'</q>

The Remainder of this Scene conſiſted entirely of Raptures, Excuſes, and Compliments, very pleaſant to have heard from the Parties; but rather dull when related at ſecond Hand.

               <p>THE Clock had now ſtruck Seven and poor <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> alone and melancholy, ſat reading a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.

               <p>Here the Book dropt from her Hand, and a Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Tears ran down into her Boſom. In this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation ſhe had continued a Minute, when the Door opened, and in came Lord <hi>Fellamar. Sophia</hi> ſtarted from her Chair at his Entrance; and his Lordſhip advancing forwards, and making a low Bow ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I am afraid, Miſs <hi>Weſtern,</hi> I break in upon you abruptly.'</q>

                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> confus'd as ſhe was, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Bombaſt (and very properly, I think,) with a Look of inconceivable Diſdain. My Lord then made another and a longer Speech of the ſame Sort. Upon

which <hi>Sophia,</hi> trembling, ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Am I really to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Lordſhip to be out of your Senſes?

               <p>If the Reader's Imagination doth not aſſiſt me, I ſhall never be able to deſcribe the Situation of theſe two Perſons when <hi>Weſtern</hi> came into the Room. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> tottered into a Chair, where ſhe ſat diſordered, pale, breathleſs, burſting with Indignation at Lord <hi>Fellamar;</hi> affrighted, and yet more rejoiced at the Arrival of her Father.</p>

               <p>AFFAIRS were in the aforeſaid Situation when Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> arrrived at Mrs. <hi>Miller'</hi>s, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jones</hi> out from the Company, as we have before ſeen, with whom, when ſhe found herſelf alone, ſhe began as follows.</p>

He carried her off, ſwearing ſhe ſhould marry Mr. <hi>Blifil;</hi> that's for your Comfort? and for poor me, I am turned out of Doors.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> anſwered <hi>Jones</hi> you frightned me out of my Wits. I imagined ſome moſt dreadfuled ſudden Accident had happened to <hi>Sophia;</hi> ſomething, compared to which, even the ſeeing her married to <hi>Blifil</hi> would be a Trifle; but while there is Life, there are Hopes, my dear <hi>Honour.</hi> Women in this Land of Liberty cannot be married by actual brutal Force.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'To be ſure, Sir, ſaid ſhe, 'that's true. There may be ſome Hopes for you; but alack-a-day! what Hopes are there for poor me? And to be ſure, Sir, you muſt be ſenſible I ſuffer all this upon your Account. All the Quarrel the Squire hath to me is for taking your Part, as I have done, againſt Mr. <hi>Blifil.'</hi>

                  <q rend="inline">'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> anſwered he, 'I am ſenſible of my Obligations to you, and will leave nothing in my Power undone to make you amends.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Alas, Sir, ſaid ſhe, what can make a Servant amends. for the Loſs of one Place, but the getting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether as good!'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Do not deſpair, Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 'I hope to reinſtate you again in the ſame.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Alack-a-day, Sir, ſaid ſhe, how can I flatter myſelf with ſuch Hopes, when I know it is a Thing impoſſible; for the Squire is ſo ſet againſt me: and yet if you ſhould ever have my Lady, as to be ſure I now hopes heartily you will; for you are a generous good natured Gentleman, and I am ſure you loves her, and to be ſure ſhe loves you as dearly as her own Soul; it is a Matter in vain to deny it; becauſe as why, every Body that is in the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my Lady, muſt ſee it; for, poor
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0618300103:156"/>
dear Lady, ſhe can't diſſemble; and if two People who loves one another a'n't happy, why who ſhould be ſo? Happineſs don't always depend upon what People has; beſides, my Lady has enough for both. To be ſure therefore as one may ſay, it would be all the Pity in the World to keep two ſuch Loviers aſunder; nay, I am convinced for my Part, you will meet together at laſt; for if it is to be, there is no preventing it. If a Marriage is made in Heaven, all the Juſtices of Peace upon Earth can't break it off. To be ſure I wiſhes that Parſon <hi>Supple</hi> had but a little more Spirit to tell the Squire of his Wickedneſs in endeavouring to force his Daughter contrary to her Liking; but then his whole Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is on the Squire, and ſo the poor Gentleman, though he is a very religious good ſort of Man, and talks of the Badneſs of ſuch Doings behind the Squire's Back, yet he dares not ſay his Soul is his own to his Face. To be ſure I never ſaw him make ſo bold as juſt now, I was afeard the Squire would have ſtruck him.—I would not have your Honour be melancholy, Sir, nor diſpair; Things may go better, as long as you are ſure of my Lady, and that I am certain you may be, for ſhe never will be brought to conſent to marry any other Man. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am terribly afeard the Squire will do her a Miſchief in his Paſſion: For he is a prodigious paſſionate Gentleman, and I am afeard too the poor Lady will be brought to break her Heart, for ſhe is as tender-hearted as a Chicken; it is pity methinks, ſhe had not a little of my Courage. If I was in Love with a young Man, and my Father offered to lock me up, I'd tear his Eyes out, but I'd come at him; but then there's a great Fortune in the Caſe, which it is in her Father's Power either to give her, or not; that, to be ſure, may make ſome Difference.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Jones</hi> gave ſtrict Attention to all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Harangue, or whether it was for want of any

Vacancy in the Diſcourſe, I cannot determine; but he never once attempted to anſwer, nor did ſhe once ſtop, till <hi>Partridge</hi> came running into the Room, and informed him that the great Lady was upon the Stairs.</p>
               <p>Nothing could equal the Dilemma to which <hi>Jones</hi> was now reduced. <hi>Honour</hi> knew nothing of any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that ſubſiſted between him and Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton,</hi> and ſhe was almoſt the laſt Perſon in the World to whom he would have communicated it. In this Hurry and Diſtreſs, he took (as is common enough) the worſt Courſe, and inſtead of expoſing her to the Lady, which would have been of little Conſequence, he choſe to expoſe the Lady to her; he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to hide <hi>Honour,</hi> whom he had but juſt time to convey behind the Bed, and to draw the Curtains.</p>
               <p>The Hurry in which <hi>Jones</hi> had been all Day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on Account of his poor Landlady and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the Terrors occaſioned by Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> and the Confuſion into which he was thrown by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Arrival of Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> had altogether driven former Thoughts out of his Head; ſo that it never once occurr'd to his Memory to act the Part of a ſick Man; which indeed, neither the Gayety of his Dreſs, nor the Freſhneſs of his Countenance would have at all ſupported.</p>
               <p>He received her Ladyſhip therefore rather agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to her Deſires than to her Expectations, with all the good Humour he could muſter in his Countenance, and without any real or affected Appearance of the leaſt Diſorder.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> no ſooner entered the Room, than ſhe ſquatted herſelf down on the Bed: <q rend="inline">'So, my dear <hi>Jones,'</hi> ſaid ſhe, you find nothing can detain me long from you. Perhaps I ought to be angry with you, that I have neither ſeen nor heard from you all Day; for I perceive your Diſtemper would have ſuffered you to come abroad; Nay, I ſuppoſe you have not ſat in your Chamber all Day dreſt up

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay, Lady <hi>Bellaſton,'</hi> ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 'I am ſure your Ladyſhip will not upbraid me with neglect of Duty, when I only waited for Orders. Who, my dear Creature, hath Reaſon to complain? Who miſſed an Appointment laſt Night, and left an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Man to expect, and wiſh, and ſigh, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh?'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Do not mention it, my dear Mr. <hi>Jones,'</hi> cries ſhe. 'If you knew the Occaſion, you would pity me. In ſhort, it is impoſſible to conceive what Women of Condition are obliged to ſuffer from the Impertinence of Fools, in order to keep up the Farce of the World.

the Law of Arms. As this Objection did not occur to Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> who was ignorant of any other Woman being there but herſelf, ſhe waited ſome time in great Aſtoniſhment for an Anſwer from <hi>Jones,</hi> who conſcious of the ridiculous Figure he made, ſtood at a Diſtance, and not daring to give the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Anſwer, gave none at all. Nothing can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more comic, nor yet more tragical than this Scene would have been, if it had laſted much longer. The Lady had already changed Colour two or three times; had got up from the Bed and ſat down again, while <hi>Jones</hi> was wiſhing the Ground to ſink under him, or the Houſe to fall on his Head, when an odd Accident freed him from an Embaraſſment out of which neither the Eloquence of <hi>Cicero,</hi> nor the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks of a <hi>Machiavel</hi> could have delivered him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out utter Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>This was no other than the Arrival of young <hi>Nightingale</hi> dead drunk; or rather in that State of Drunkenneſs which deprives Men of the Uſe of their Reaſon, without depriving them of the Uſe of their Limbs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> and her Daughters were in Bed, and <hi>Partridge</hi> was ſmoaking his Pipe by the Kitchen Fire; ſo that he arrived at Mr. <hi>Jones'</hi>s Chamber Door with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out any Interruption. This he burſt open, and was entering without any Ceremony, when <hi>Jones</hi> ſtarted from his Seat, and ran to oppoſe him; which he did ſo effectually, that <hi>Nightingale</hi> never came far enough within the Door to ſee who was ſitting on the Bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nightingale</hi> had in Reality miſtaken <hi>Jones'</hi>s Apart<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment for that in which himſelf had lodged; he there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſtrongly inſiſted on coming in, often ſwearing that he would not be kept from his own Bed. <hi>Jones</hi> however, prevailed over him, and delivered him in to the Hands of <hi>Partridge,</hi> whom the Noiſe on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0618300103:160"/>
And now <hi>Jones</hi> was unwillingly obliged to return to his own Apartment, where at the very Inſtant of his Entrance he heard Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> venting an Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, though not a very loud one; and at the ſame time, ſaw her flinging herſelf into a Chair in a vaſt Agitation, which in a Lady of a tender Conſtitution would have been an Hyſteric Fit.</p>
               <p>In reality the Lady, frightened with the Struggle between the two Men, of which ſhe did not know what would be the Iſſue, as ſhe heard <hi>Nightingale</hi> ſwear many Oaths he would come to his own Bed, attempted to retire to her known Place of Hiding, which to her great Confuſion ſhe found already oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by another.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Is this Uſage to be borne, Mr. <hi>Jones?'</hi> cries the Lady, '—baſeſt of Men!—What Wretch is this to whom you have expoſed me?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Wretch!' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> burſting in a violent Rage from her Place of Concealment—'marry come up!—'Wretch forſooth!—As poor a Wretch as I am, I am honeſt, that is more than ſome Folks who are richer can ſay.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> inſtead of applying himſelf directly to take off the Edge of Mrs. <hi>Honour'</hi>s Reſentment, as a more experienced Gallant would have done, fell to curſing his Stars, and lamenting himſelf as the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Man in the World; and preſently after, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> he fell to ſome very abſurd Proteſtations of Innocence. By this time the Lady having recovered the Uſe of her Reaſon, which he had as ready as any Woman in the World, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on ſuch Occaſions, calmly replied; <q rend="inline">'Sir, you need make no Apologies, I ſee now who the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is; I did not at firſt know Mrs. <hi>Honour;</hi> but now I do, I can ſuſpect nothing wrong between her and you; and I am ſure ſhe is a Woman of too good Senſe to put any wrong Conſtructions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Viſits to you; I have been always her Friend,

and it may be in my Power to be much more ſo hereafter.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> was altogether as placable, as ſhe was paſſionate. Hearing therefore Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> aſſume the ſoft Tone, ſhe likewiſe ſoftened her's. —'I'm ſure, Madam,' ſaid ſhe, <q rend="inline">'I have been always ready to acknowledge your Ladyſhip's Friendſhips to me; ſure I never had ſo good a Friend as your Ladyſhip—and to be ſure now I ſee it is your Ladyſhip that I ſpoke to, I could almoſt bite my Tongue off for very mad.—I Conſtructions upon your Ladyſhip—to be ſure it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Servant as I am to think about ſuch a great Lady—I mean I was a Servant: for indeed I am no Body's Servant now, the more miſerable Wretch is me.—I have loſt the beſt Miſtreſs.'</q>—Here <hi>Honour</hi> thought fit to produce a Shower of Tears. —'<q rend="inline">'Don't cry, Child.' ſays the good Lady, 'Ways perhaps my be found to make you amends.

               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> followed her down Stairs, often offering her his Hand, which ſhe abſolutely refuſed him, and go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At his Return up Stairs, a long Dialogue paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> while ſhe was adjuſting herſelf after the Diſcompoſure ſhe had undergone. The Subject of this was his Infidelity to her young Lady; on which ſhe enlarged with great Bitterneſs but <hi>Jones</hi> at laſt found means to reconcile her, and not only ſo, but to obtain a Promiſe of moſt inviolable Secrecy, and that ſhe would the next Morning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

And here perhaps it may be proper to account for the Eſcape which this young Gentleman had made from his Uncle, and for his Appearance in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which we have ſeen him the Night before.</p>
               <p>Now when the Uncle had arrived at his Lodgings with his Nephew, partly to indulge his own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (for he dearly loved his Bottle) and partly to diſqualify his Nephew from the immediate Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Purpoſe, he ordered Wine to be ſet on the Table; with which he ſo briſkly ply'd the young Gentleman; that this latter, who though not much uſed to Drinking, did not deteſt it ſo as to be guilty of Diſobedience or of want of Complaiſance by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, was ſoon completely finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Juſt as the Uncle had obtained this Victory, and was preparing a Bed for his Nephew, a Meſſenger arrived with a Piece of News, which ſo entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted and ſhocked him, that he in a Moment loſt all Conſideration for his Nephew, and his whole Mind became entirely taken up with his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
               <p>This ſudden and afflicting News was no leſs than that his Daughter had taken the Opportunity of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the firſt Moment of his Abſence, and had gone off with a Neighbouring young Clergyman; againſt whom tho' her Father could have had but one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, namely, that he was worth nothing, yet ſhe had never thought proper to communicate her Amoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> even to that Father; and ſo artfully ſhe managed, that it had never been once ſuſpected by any, till now that it was conſummated.</p>
               <p>Old Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> no ſooner received this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than in the utmoſt Confuſion he ordered a Poſt-Chaiſe to be inſtantly got ready, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his Nephew to the Care of a Servant, he directly left the Houſe, ſcarce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0618300103:164"/>
The Uncle being thus departed, when the Servant came to attend the Nephew to Bed, had waked him for that Purpoſe, and had at laſt made him ſenſible that his Uncle was gone, he, inſtead of accepting the kind Offices tendered him, inſiſted on a Chair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called; with this the Servant, who had received no ſtrict Orders to the contrary, readily complied; and thus being conducted back to the Houſe of Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> he had ſtaggered up to Mr. <hi>Jones'</hi>s Chamber, as hath been before recounted.</p>
               <p>This Bar of the Uncle being now removed (though young <hi>Nightingale</hi> knew not as yet in what Manner) and all Parties being quickly ready, the Mother Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and his Love ſtept into a Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Coach, which conveyed him to Doctor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; where Miſs <hi>Nancy</hi> was, in vulgar Language, ſoon made an honeſt Woman, and the poor Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in the pureſt Senſe of the Word, one of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of all human Beings.</p>
               <p>And now Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> having ſeen his good Offices to that poor Woman and her Family brought to a happy Concluſion, began to apply himſelf to his own Concerns; but here leſt many of my Readers ſhould cenſure his Folly for thus troubling himſelf with the Affairs of others, and leſt ſome few ſhould think he acted more diſintereſtedly than indeed he did, we think proper to aſſure our Reader, that he was ſo far from being unconcerned in this Matter, that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndeed a very conſiderable Intereſt in bringing it to that final Conſummation.</p>
               <p>To explain this ſeeming Paradox at once, he was one who could truly ſay with him in <hi>Terence, Homo ſum: Nihil humani a me alienum puto.</hi> He was never an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wretchedneſs to the higheſt Pitch of Joy without conveying great Felicity to himſelf; more perhaps than worldly Men often purchaſe to themſelves by undergoing the moſt ſevere Labour, and often by wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the deepeſt Iniquity.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Readers who are of the ſame Complexion with him will perhaps think this ſhort Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains abundance of Matter; while others may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably wiſh, ſhort as it is, that it had been totally ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as impertinent to the main Deſign, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they conclude is to bring Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or if poſſible, to a more deplorable Cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe.</p>

                  <hi>Jones</hi> had juſt read over theſe three Billets when Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> came into the Room. <q rend="inline">'Well, <hi>Tom,'</hi> ſaid he, 'any News from Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> after laſt Night's Adventure?'</q> (for it was now no Secret to any one in that Houſe who the Lady was.) <q rend="inline">'The Lady <hi>Bellaſton?</hi>
                  </q> anſwered <hi>Jones</hi> very gravely.—<q rend="inline">'Nay, dear <hi>Tom,</hi>' cries <hi>Nightingale,</hi> 'don't be ſo reſerved to your Friends.

                  <q rend="inline">'And did you really then know the Lady at the Maſquerade?'</q> ſaid <hi>Jones.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, upon my Soul, did I,' ſaid <hi>Nightingale,</hi> 'and have given you twenty Hints of it ſince, though you ſeemed always ſo tender on that Point, that I wou'd not ſpeak plainly.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0618300103:167"/>
yet as he was thoroughly ignorant of the Town and had very little Acquaintance in it, he had yet no Knowledge of that Character which is vulgarly called a Demirep; that is to ſay, a Woman that intrigues 'with every Man ſhe likes, under the Name and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Virtue; and who, though ſome over-nice Ladies will not be ſeen with her, is viſited (as they term it) by the whole Town; in ſhort, whom every Body knows to be what no Body calls her.</p>
               <p>When he found, therefore, that <hi>Nightingale</hi> was perfectly acquainted with his Intrigue, and began to ſuſpect that ſo ſcrupulous a Delicacy as he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto obſerved, was not quite neceſſary on the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he gave a Latitude to his Friend's Tongue, and deſired him to ſpeak plainly what he knew, on had ever heard of the Lady.</p>

And yet I muſt deſert her, or be guilty of the blackeſt Treachery to one, who deſerves infinitely better of me than ſhe can: A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, my <hi>Nightingale,</hi> for whom I have a Paſſion which few can have an Idea of.

She is remarkably liberal where ſhe likes; though, let me tell you, her Favours are ſo prudently beſtowed, that they ſhould rather raiſe a Man's Vanity, than his Gratitude.'</q> In ſhort, <hi>Nightingale</hi> proceeded ſo far on this Head, and told his Friend ſo many Stories of the Lady, which he ſwore to the Truth of, that he entirely removed all Eſteem for her from the Breaſt of <hi>Jones;</hi> and his Gratitude was leſſened in Proportion. Indeed he began to look on all the Favours he had received, rather as Wages than Benefits, which not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated

her, but himſelf too in his own Conceit, and put him quite out of Humour with both. From this Diſguſt, his Mind, by a natural Tranſition, turned towards <hi>Sophia:</hi> Her Virtue, her Purity, her Love to him, her Sufferings on his Account, filled all his Thoughts, and made his Commerce with Lady <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton</hi> appear ſtill more odious. The Reſult of all was, that though his turning himſelf out of her <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> in which Light he now ſaw his Affair with her, would be the Loſs of his Bread, yet he determined to quit her; if he could but find a handſome Pretence; which having communicated to his Friend, <hi>Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale</hi> conſidered a little, and then ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I have it, my Boy; I have found out a ſure Method: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Marriage to her, and I would venture Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Succeſs.'</q>

Though <hi>Jones</hi> was well ſatisfied with his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from a Thraldom which thoſe who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to be none of the lighteſt, he was not, however, perfectly eaſy in his Mind.

               <p>The two Gentlemen were now ſummoned down to Dinner, where Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> who performed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Office of Cook, had exerted her beſt Talents, to celebrate the Wedding of her Daughter. This joyful Circumſtance, ſhe aſcribed principally to the friendly behaviour of <hi>Jones,</hi> her whole Soul was fired with Gratitude towards him, and all her Looks, Words, and Actions were ſo buſied in expreſſing it, that her Daughter, and even her new Son-in-Law, were very little the Objects of her Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Dinner was juſt ended when Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> received a Letter, but as we had Letters enough in this Chapter, we ſhall communicate the Contents in our next.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Conſiſting partly of Facts, and partly of Obſervations upon them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Letter then which arrived at the End of the preceding Chapter was from Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and the Purport of it was his Intention to come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Town, with his Nephew <hi>Blifil,</hi> and a Deſire to be accommodated with his uſual Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which were the firſt Floor for himſelf, and the ſecond for his Nephew.</p>
               <p>The Chearfulneſs which had before diſplay'd itſelf in the Countenance of the poor Woman, was a little clouded on this Occaſion. This News did indeed a good deal diſconcert her. To requite ſo diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted a Match with her Daughter, by preſently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her new Son-in-Law out of Doors, appeared to her very unjuſtifiable, on the one Hand; and on the other, ſhe could ſcarce bear the Thoughts of making any Excuſe to Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> after all the Obligations received from him, for depriving him of Lodgings which were indeed ſtrictly his Due: For that Gentleman, in conferring all his numberleſs Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on others, acted by a Rule diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to what is practiſed by moſt generous People. He contrived, on all Occaſions, to hide his Beneficence not only from the World, but even from the Object of it. He conſtantly uſed the Words Lend and Pay, inſtead of Give; and by every other Method he could invent, always leſſened the Favours he conferred with his Tongue, while he was heaping them with both his Hands. When he ſettled the Annuity of <hi>50l.</hi> a Year, therefore, on Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> he told her, <q rend="inline">'It was in Conſideration of always having her Firſt-Floor when he was in Town,'</q> (which he ſcarce ever intended to be) <q rend="inline">'but that ſhe might let it at any other Time, for that he would always ſend her a Month's
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0618300103:174"/>
Warning.'</q> He was now, however, hurried to Town ſo ſuddenly, that he had no Opportunity of giving ſuch Notice; and this Hurry probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him, when he wrote for his Lodgings, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>if they were then empty:</hi> For he would moſt certainly have been well ſatisfied to have relinquiſhed them on a leſs ſufficient Excuſe than what Mrs. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> could now have made.</p>
               <p>But there are a Sort of Perſons, who, as <hi>Prior</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well remarks, direct their Conduct by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Beyond the fix'd and ſettled Rules</l>
                  <l>Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools:</l>
                  <l>Beyond the Letter of the Law.</l>
               </q>
               <p>To theſe it is ſo far from being ſufficient that their Defence would acquit them at the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> that they are not even contented, though Conſcience, the ſevereſt of all Judges, ſhould diſcharge them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of the Fair and Honourable will ſatisfy the Delicacy of their Minds; and if any of their Actions fall ſhort of this Mark, they mope and pine, are as uneaſy and reſtleſs as a Murderer, who is afraid of a Ghoſt, or of the Hangman.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> was one of theſe. She could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her Uneaſineſs at this Letter; with the Contents of which ſhe had no ſooner acquainted the Company, and given ſome Hints of her Diſtreſs, than <hi>Jones,</hi> her good Angel, preſently relieved her Anxiety. <q rend="inline">'As for myſelf, Madam,' ſaid he, 'my Lodging is at your Service at a Moment's Warning; and Mr. <hi>Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale,</hi> I am ſure, as he cannot yet prepare a Houſe fit to receive his Lady, will conſent to return to his new Lodging, whither Mrs. <hi>Nightingale</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſent to go.</q> With which Propoſal both Huſband and Wife inſtantly agreed.</p>
               <p>The Reader will eaſily believe, that the Cheeks of Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> began again to glow with additional Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to <hi>Jones;</hi> but, perhaps, it may be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0618300103:175"/>
to perſuade him that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> having, in his laſt Speech, called her Daughter Mrs. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> (it being the firſt Time that agreeable Sound had ever reached her Ears) gave the fond Mother more Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and warmed her Heart more towards <hi>Jones,</hi> than his having diſſipated her preſent Anxiety.</p>
               <p>The next Day was then appointed for the Removal of the new-married Couple, and of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who was likewiſe to be provided for in the ſame Houſe with his Friend. And now the Serenity of the Company was again reſtored, and they paſt the Day in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chearfulneſs, all except <hi>Jones,</hi> who, though he outwardly accompanied the reſt in their Mirth, felt many a bitter Pang on the Account of his <hi>Sophia;</hi> which were not a little heightened by the News of Mr. <hi>Blifil'</hi>s coming to Town, (for he clearly ſaw the Intention of his Journey:) And what greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated his Concern was, that Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> who had promiſed to enquire after <hi>Sophia,</hi> and to make her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to him early the next Evening, had diſappointed him.</p>

               <p>THERE was a Lady, one Mrs. <hi>Hunt,</hi> who had often ſeen <hi>Jones</hi> at the Houſe where he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the Women there, and indeed a very great Friend to Mrs. <hi>Miller.</hi> Her Age was about thirty, for ſhe owned ſix and twenty; her Face and Perſon very good, only inclining a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too much to be fat. She had been married young by her Relations to an old <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchant, who having got a great Fortune, had left off Trade. With him ſhe lived without Reproach, but not without Pain, in a State of great Self denial, for about twelve Years; and her Virtue was rewarded by his dying, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her very rich. The firſt Year of her Widowhood was juſt at an End, and ſhe had paſt it in a good deal of Retirement, ſeeing only a few particular Friends, and dividing her Time between her Devotions and Novels, of which ſhe was always extremely fond. Very good Health, a very warm Conſtitution, and a great deal of Religion made it abſolutely neceſſary for her to marry again; and ſhe reſolved to pleaſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her ſecond Huſband, as ſhe had done her Friends in the firſt.

However as ſhe was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Squire was a Man of a vaſt Fortune, and as ſhe had taken Care to exact a very extraordinary Price for her Rooms, ſhe did not think proper to give any Offence? for though ſhe was not without ſome Concern for the Confinement of poor <hi>Sophia,</hi> of whoſe great Sweetneſs of Temper and Affability, the Maid of the Houſe had made ſo favourable a Report, which was confirmed by all the Squire's Servants, yet ſhe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0618300103:197"/>
had much more Concern for her own Intereſt, than to provoke one, whom, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe perceived to be a very haſtiſh Kind of a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Sophia</hi> eat but little, yet ſhe was regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerved with her Meals; indeed I believe if ſhe had liked any one Rarity, that the Squire, however an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, would have ſpared neither Pains nor Coſt to have procured it for her; ſince, however ſtrange it may appear to ſome of my Readers, he really doated on his Daughter, and to give her any Kind of Pleaſure was the higheſt Satisfaction of his Life.</p>
               <p>The Dinner Hour being arrived, black <hi>George</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her up a Pullet, the Squire himſelf (for he had ſworn not to part with the Key) attending the Door. As <hi>George</hi> depoſited the Diſh, ſome Compliments paſſed between him and <hi>Sophia,</hi> (for he had not ſeen her ſince ſhe left the Country, and ſhe treated every Servant with more Reſpect than ſome Perſons ſhew to thoſe who are in a very ſlight Degree their Inferiors) <hi>Sophia</hi> would have had him take the Pullet back, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe could not eat, but <hi>George</hi> begged her to try, and particularly recommended her to the Eggs, of which he ſaid it was full.</p>
               <p>All this Time the Squire was waiting at the Door; but <hi>George</hi> was a great Favourite with his Maſter, as his Employment was in Concerns of the higheſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, namely, about the Game, and was accuſtomed to take many Liberties. He had officiouſly carried up the Dinner, being, as he ſaid, very deſirous to ſee his young Lady; he made therefore no Scruple of keeping his Maſter ſtanding above ten Minutes, while Civilities were paſſing between him and <hi>Sophia,</hi> for which he received only a good-humoured Rebuke at the Door when he returned.</p>
               <p>The Eggs of Pullets, Partridges, Pheaſants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were, as <hi>George</hi> well knew, the moſt favourite Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Sophia.</hi> It was therefore no Wonder, that he who was a very good-natured Fellow, ſhould take
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0618300103:198"/>
Care to ſupply her with this Kind of Delicacy, at a Time when all the Servants in the Houſe were afraid ſhe would be ſtarved; for ſhe had ſcarce ſwallowed a ſingle Morſel in the laſt forty Hours.</p>
               <p>Though Vexation hath not the ſame Effect on all Perſons, as it uſually hath on a Widow, whoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite it often renders ſharper than it can be rendered by the Air on <hi>Banſted</hi> Downs, or <hi>Saliſbury</hi> Plain, yet the ſublimeſt Grief, notwithſtanding what ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may ſay to the contrary, will eat at laſt. And <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf, after ſome little Conſideration, began to diſſect the Fowl, which ſhe found to be as full of Eggs as <hi>George</hi> had reported it.</p>
               <p>But if ſhe was pleaſed with theſe, it contained ſomething which would have delighted the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety much more; for if a Fowl with three Legs be ſo invaluable a Curioſity, when perhaps Time hath produced a Thouſand ſuch, at what Price ſhall we eſteem a Bird which ſo totally contradicts all the Laws of Animal Oeconomy, as to contain a Letter in its Belly? <hi>Ovid</hi> tells us of a Flower into which <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthus</hi> was metamorphoſed, that bears Letters on its Leaves, which <hi>Virgil</hi> recommended as a Miracle to the Royal Society of his Day; but no Age nor Nation hath ever recorded a Bird with a Letter in its Maw.</p>
               <p>But though a Miracle of this Kind might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged all the <hi>Academies des Sciences</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> and perhaps in a fruitleſs Enquiry, yet the Reader by bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recollecting the laſt Dialogue which paſſed between Meſſieurs <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Partridge,</hi> will be very eaſily ſatisfied from whence this Letter came, and how it found its Paſſage into the Fowl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> notwithſtanding her long Faſt, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her favourite Diſh was there before her, no ſooner ſaw the Letter than ſhe immediately ſnatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows.</p>

               <p>In the Evening while <hi>Sophia</hi> was meditating on the Letter ſhe had received, or ſomething elſe, a violent Noiſe from below diſturbed her Meditation. This Noiſe was no other than a round Bout at Alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between two Perſons. One of the Combatants, by his Voice, ſhe immediately diſtinguiſhed to be her Father; but ſhe did not ſo ſoon diſcover the ſhriller Pipes to belong to the Organ of her Aunt <hi>Weſtern,</hi> who was juſt arrived in Town, and having by means of one of her Servants, who ſtopt at the <hi>Hercules Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> learnt where her Brother lodged, ſhe drove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to his Lodgings.</p>

               <p>THE Squire and the Parſon (for the Landlord was now otherwiſe engaged) were ſmoaking their Pipes together, when the Arrival of the Lady was firſt ſignified. The Squire no ſooner heard her Name, than he immediately ran down to uſher her up Stairs; for he was a great Obſerver of ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, eſpecially to his Siſter, of whom he ſtood more in awe than of any other human Creature, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would own this, nor did he perhaps know it himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> on her Arrival in the Dining-Room, having flung herſelf into a Chair, begun thus to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue. <q rend="inline">'Well, ſurely no one ever had ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Journey.

                  <q rend="inline">'How! Brother, ſaid the Lady, have I ever given you the leaſt Reaſon to imagine I ſhould commend you for locking up your Daughter?

               <p>THE Reader may now perhaps be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with us to Mr, <hi>Jones,</hi> who at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hour attended on Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> but before we relate the Converſation which now paſt, it may be

proper, according to our Method, to return a little back, and to account for ſo great an Alteration of Behaviour in this Lady, that from changing her Lodging principally to avoid Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> ſhe had now induſtriouſly, as hath been ſeen, ſought this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</p>
               <p>And here we ſhall need only to reſort to what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the preceding Day, when hearing from Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was arrived in Town, ſhe went to pay her Duty to him, at his Lodgings a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Piccadilly,</hi> when ſhe was received with many ſcurvy Compellations too coarſe to be repeated, and was even threatned to be kicked out of Doors. From hence an old Servant of her Aunt <hi>Weſtern,</hi> with whom ſhe was well acquainted, conducted her to the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Lady, who treated her, not more kindly, but more politely; or, to ſay the Truth, with Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in another Way. In ſhort, ſhe returned from both, plainly convinced not only that her Scheme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Reconciliation had proved abortive, but that ſhe muſt for ever give over all Thoughts of bringing it about by any Means whatever. From this Moment De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Revenge only filled her Mind; and in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Reader muſt remember, that he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> in the Account ſhe gave o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

She had therefore no Doubt but that the good Lady would as eaſily liſten to the Addreſſes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> as ſhe had before done to the other, for the Superiority of Charms, was clearly on the ſide of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and the Advance which her Aunt had
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0618300103:228"/>
ſince made in Age, ſhe concluded (how juſtly I will not ſay) was an Argument rather in Favour of her Project than againſt it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when <hi>Jones</hi> attended after a previous Declaration of her Deſire of ſerving him, ariſing, as ſhe ſaid from a Firm Aſſurance how much ſhe ſhould by ſo doing oblige <hi>Sophia;</hi> and after ſome Excuſes for her former Diſappointment, and after acquainting Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in whoſe Cuſtody his Miſtreſs was, of which ſhe thought him ignorant; ſhe very explicitly mentioned her Scheme to him, and adviſed him to make Sham Addreſſes to the older Lady, in order to procure an eaſy Acceſs to the Younger, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at the ſame Time of the Succeſs which Mr. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> had formerly owed to the very ſame Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> expreſt great Gratitude to the Lady for the kind Intentions towards him which ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and indeed, teſtified by this Propoſal; but beſides intimating ſome Diffidence of Succeſs from the Lady's Knowledge of his Love to her Neice, which had not been her Caſe in regard to Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick,</hi> he ſaid, he was afraid Miſs <hi>Weſtern</hi> would never agree to an Impoſition of this Kind, as well from her utter Deteſtation of all Fallacy, as from her avowed Duty to her Aunt.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> was a little nettled at this; and indeed if it may not be called a Lapſe of the Tongue, it was a ſmall Deviation from Politeneſs in <hi>Jones,</hi> and into which he would ſcarce have fallen, had not the Delight he felt in praiſing <hi>Sophia,</hi> hurried him out of all Reflection; for this Commendation of one Couſin was more than a tacit Rebuke on the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' anſwered the Lady, with ſome Warmth, 'I cannot think there is any thing eaſier than to cheat an old Woman with a Profeſſion of

Love, when her Complexion is amorous; and tho' ſhe is my Aunt, I muſt ſay, there never was a more liquoriſh one than her Ladyſhip. Can't you pretend that the Deſpair of poſſeſſing her Neice, from her being promiſed to <hi>Blifil,</hi> has made you turn your Thoughts towards her? As to my Couſin <hi>Sophia,</hi> I can't imagine her to be ſuch a Simpleton as to have the leaſt Scruple on ſuch an Account or to conceive any Harm in puniſhing one of theſe Haggs for the many Miſchiefs they bring upon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, by their Tragi comic Paſſions; for which I think it is pity they were not puniſhable by Law. I had no ſuch Scruple myſelf, and yet I hope my Couſin <hi>Sophia</hi> will not think it an Affront when I ſay ſhe cannot deteſt every real Species of Falſhood more than her Couſin <hi>Fitzpatrick.</hi> To my Aunt indeed I pretend no Duty, nor doth ſhe deſerve any. However, Sir, I have given you my Advice, and if you decline purſuing it, I ſhall have the leſs Opinion of your Underſtanding, that's all.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> now clearly ſaw the Error he had committed, and exerted his utmoſt Power to rectify it; but he only faultered and fluttered into Nonſenſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. To ſay the Truth, it is often ſafer to abide by the Conſequences of the firſt Blunder, than to endeavour to rectify it; for by ſuch Endeavours, we generally plunge deeper inſtead of extricating our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and few Perſons will on ſuch Occaſions, have the good Nature, which Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd to <hi>Jones;</hi> by ſaying, with a Smile, <q rend="inline">'You need attempt no more Excuſes; for I can eaſily forgive a real Lover, whatever is the Effect of Fondneſs for his Miſtreſs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>She then renewed her Propoſal, and very fervently recommended it, omitting no Argument which her Invention could ſuggeſt on the Subject; for ſhe was ſo violently incenſed againſt her Aunt, that ſcarce any Thing was capable of affording her equal Pleaſure

               <p>To ſay the Truth, perfect Beauty in both Sexes is a more irreſiſtible Object than it is generally thought; for notwithſtanding ſome of us are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with more homely Lots, and learn by Rot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When <hi>Jones</hi> had finiſhed his Exclamations, many of which would have become the Mouth of <hi>Oroondates</hi> himſelf, Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> heaved a deep Sigh, and taking her Eyes off from <hi>Jones,</hi> on whom they had been ſome time fixed, and dropping them on the Ground, ſhe cry'd, <q rend="inline">'Indeed Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> I pity you, but it is the Curſe of ſuch Tenderneſs to be thrown away on thoſe who are inſenſible of it.

In Reality it confirmed his Reſolution of returning to her no more; for faulty as he hath appeared in this Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, his whole Thoughts were now ſo confined to his <hi>Sophia,</hi> that I believe no Woman upon Earth could have now drawn him into an Act of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
               <p>Fortune however, who was not his Friend, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he intended to give her no ſecond Opportunity, to make the beſt of this; and accordingly produced the tragical Incident which we are now in ſorrowful Notes to record.</p>

To diſcharge the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Duties in an adequate Manner is no eaſy Taſk, and ſhall we lay this Burthen upon a Woman while we at the ſame Time deprive her of all that Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which may enable her to undergo it? Shall we tear her very Heart from her, while we enjoin her Duties to which a whole Heart is ſcarce equal. I muſt ſpeak very plainly here, I think Parents who act in this Manner are Acceſſaries to all the Guilt which their Children afterwards incur, and of Courſe muſt, before a juſt Judge, expect to partake of their Puniſhment; but if they could avoid this, good Heaven! is there a Soul who can bear the Thought of having contributed to the Damnation of his Child?'</q>

from the Foreſt, and to repoſe herſelf in ſome Field or Grove, the whole Pariſh is preſently alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every Man is ready to ſet his Dogs after her; and if ſhe is preſerved from the reſt by the good Squire, it is only that he may ſecure her for his own eating.</p>
               <p>I have conſidered a very fine young Woman of Fortune and Faſhion, when firſt found ſtrayed from the Pale of her Nurſery, to be in pretty much the ſame Situation with this Doe. The Town is immediately in an Uproar, ſhe is hunted from Park to Play, from Court to Aſſembly, from Aſſembly to her own Chamber, and rarely eſcapes a ſingle Seaſon from the Jaws of ſome Devourer or other: For if her Friends protect her from ſome, it is only to deliver her over to one of their own chuſing, often more diſagreeable to her than any of the reſt: While whole Herds on Flocks of other Women ſecurely, and ſcarce regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, traverſe the Park, the Play, the Opera, and the Aſſembly; and though, for the moſt Part at leaſt, they are at laſt devoured, yet for a long Time do they wanton in Liberty, without Diſturbance or Controul.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe Paragons, none ever taſted more of this Perſecution than poor <hi>Sophia.</hi> Her ill Stars were not contented with all that ſhe had ſuffered on Account of <hi>Blifil,</hi> they now raiſed her another Purſuer, who ſeemed likely to torment her no leſs than the other had done. For though her Aunt was leſs violent, ſhe was no leſs aſſiduous in teazing her, than her Father had been before.</p>
               <p>The Servants were no ſooner departed after Dinner than Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> who had opened the Matter to <hi>Sophia,</hi> informed her, <q rend="inline">'That ſhe expected his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that very afternoon, and intended to take the firſt Opportunity of leaving her alone with him.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'If you do, Madam,' anſwered <hi>Sophia,</hi> with ſome Spirit, 'I ſhall take the firſt Opportunity of leaving him by himſelf.'</q>

is this the Return you make me for my Kindneſs, in relieving you from your Confinement at your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You know, Madam,' ſaid <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'the Cauſe of that Confinement was a Refuſal to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with my Father, in accepting a Man I deteſted; and will my dear Aunt who hath relieved me from that Diſtreſs, involve me in another equally bad?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And do you think then, Madam,' anſwered Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> 'that there is no Difference between my Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blifil?'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Very little, in my Opinion,' cries <hi>Sophia;</hi> 'and if I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to one, I would certainly have the Merit of ſacrificing myſelf to my Father's Pleaſure.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Then my Pleaſure I find,' ſaid the Aunt, 'hath very little Weight with you; but that conſideration ſhall not move me. I act from nobler Motives. The View of aggrandizing my Family, of ennobling yourſelf is what I proceed upon. Have you no Senſe of Ambition? Are there no Charms in the Thoughts of having a Coronet on your Coach?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'None, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Honour,' ſaid <hi>Sophia.</hi> 'A Pincuſhion upon my Coach would pleaſe me juſt as well.'</q>

I am ſorry, Neice, you force me to uſe theſe Words; but I cannot bear your groveling Temper; you have none of the Blood of the <hi>Weſterns</hi> in you. But however mean and baſe your own Ideas are, you ſhall bring no Imputation on mine.

ſuppreſſing only thoſe Circumſtances which would have moſt reflected on her Daughter, and concluded with ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Now, Madam, you ſhall judge whether I can ever do enough for ſo kind, ſo good, ſo generous a young Man, and ſure he is the beſt and worthieſt of all Human Beings.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Alteration in the Countenance of <hi>Sophia</hi> had hitherto been chiefly to her Diſadvantage, and had inclined her Complexion to too great Paleneſs; but ſhe now waxed redder if poſſible, than Vermilion, <q rend="inline">'and cry'd, I know not what to ſay, certainly what ariſes from Gratitude cannot be blamed.—But what Service can my reading his Letter do your Friend, ſince I am reſolved never—'</q> Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> fell again to her Entreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but ſhe could not, ſhe ſaid, carry it back. <q rend="inline">'Well, Madam,' ſays <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'I cannot help it, if you will force it upon me—Certainly you may leave it whether I will or no.'</q> What <hi>Sophia</hi> meant, or whether ſhe meant any thing, I will not preſume to determine; but Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> actually underſtood this as a Hint, and preſently laying the Letter down on the Table took her Leave, having firſt begged Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to wait again on <hi>Sophia,</hi> which Requeſt had neither Aſſent nor Denial.</p>
               <p>The Letter lay upon the Table no longer than till Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> was out of Sight; for then <hi>Sophia</hi> opened and read it.</p>
               <p>This Letter did very little Service to his Cauſe; for it conſiſted of little more than Confeſſions of his own Unworthineſs, and bitter Lamentations of Deſpair, together with the moſt ſolemn Proteſtations of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Fideilty to <hi>Sophia,</hi> of which he ſaid, he hoped to convince her if he had ever more the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to her Preſence; and that he could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the Letter to Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that though it would not intitle him to her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, he hoped at leaſt to obtain it from her Mercy.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0618300103:265"/>
And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever leſs in his Thoughts than to marry Lady <hi>Bellaſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Sophia</hi> read the Letter twice over with great Attention, his Meaning ſtill remained a Riddle to her, nor could her Invention ſuggeſt to her any Means to Excuſe <hi>Jones.</hi> She certainly remained very angry with him, though indeed Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> took up ſo much of her Reſentment that her gentle Mind had but little left to beſtow on any other Perſon.</p>
               <p>That Lady was moſt unluckily to dine this very Day with her Aunt <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and in the Afternoon, they were all three by Appointment to go together to the Opera, and thence to Lady <hi>Thomas Hatchet'</hi>s Drum. <hi>Sophia</hi> would have gladly been excuſed from all, but ſhe would not diſoblige her Aunt; and as to the Arts of counterfeiting Illneſs, ſhe was ſo entirely a Stranger to them, that it never once entered into her Head. When ſhe was dreſt, therefore, down ſhe went, reſolved to encounter all the Horrours of the Day, and a moſt diſagreeable one it proved; for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Bellaſton</hi> took every Opportunity very civilly and ſlily to inſult her; to all which her Dejection of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits diſabled her from making any Return; and indeed, to confeſs the Truth, ſhe was at the very beſt but an different Miſtreſs of Repartee.</p>
               <p>Another Misfortune which befel <hi>Sophia,</hi> was the Company of Lord <hi>Fellamar,</hi> whom ſhe met at the Opera, and who attended her to the Drum. And though both Places were too publick to admit of any Particularities, and ſhe was farther relieved by the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick at the one Place and by the Cards at the other, ſhe could not however enjoy herſelf in his Company: for there is ſomething of Delicacy in Women, which will not ſuffer them to be even eaſy in the Preſence of a Man whom they know to have Pretenſions to them, which they are diſinclined to favour.</p>
               <p>Having in this Chapter twice mentioned a Drum, a Word which our Poſterity, it is hoped, will not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0618300103:266"/>
underſtand in the Senſe it is here applied, we ſhall, notwithſtanding our preſent Haſte, ſtop a Moment to deſcribe the Entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a Moment deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>A Drum then is an Aſſembly of well dreſſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both Sexes, moſt of whom play at Cards, and the reſt do nothing at all; while the Miſtreſs of the Houſe performs the Part of a Landlady at an Inn, and like the Landlady of an Inn prides herſelf in the Number of her Gueſts, though ſhe doth not always, like her, get any thing by it.</p>
               <p>No wonder then as ſo much Spirits muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ſupport any Vivacity in theſe Scenes of Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we hear Perſons of Faſhion eternally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the Want of them; a Complaint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined entirely to upper Life. How inſupportable muſt we imagine this Round of Impertinence to have been to <hi>Sophia,</hi> at this time; how difficult muſt ſhe have found it to force the Appearance of Gaiety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Looks, when her Mind dictated nothing but the tendereſt Sorrow, and when every Thought was charged with tormenting Ideas.</p>
               <p>Night, however at laſt, reſtored her to her Pillow, where we will leave her to ſoothe her Melancholy at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leaſt, though incapable we are afraid of Reſt, and ſhall purſue our Hiſtory, which ſomething whiſpers us is now arrived at the Eve of ſome great Event.</p>

a full Account from the faithful Retailer <hi>Partridge.</hi> She then explained the Obligations ſhe had to <hi>Jones;</hi> not that ſhe was entirely explicite with regard to her Daughter; for though ſhe had the utmoſt. Confidence in Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and though there could be no Hopes of keeping an Affair ſecret, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily known to more than half a Dozen; yet ſhe could not prevail with herſelf to mention thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which reflected moſt on the Chaſtity of poor <hi>Nancy;</hi> but ſmothered that Part of her Evidence as cautiouſly as if ſhe had been before a Judge, and the Girl was now on her Trial for the Murder of a Baſtard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> ſaid, there were few Characters ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely vicious as not to have the leaſt Mixture of Good in them. <q rend="inline">'However,' ſays he, 'I cannot deny but that you had ſome Obligations to the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, bad as he is, and I ſhall therefore Excuſe what has paſt already, but muſt inſiſt you never mention his Name to me more; for I promiſe you it was upon the fulleſt and plaineſt Evidence that I reſolved to take the Meaſures I have taken.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, Sir, ſays ſhe, I make not the leaſt doubt, but Time will ſhew all Matters in their true and natural Colours, and that you will be convinced this poor young Man deſerves better of you than ſome other Folks that ſhall be nameleſs.'</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I am ſure, Sir,' anſwered Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> a little frightened (for though Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> had the utmoſt Sweetneſs and Benevolence in his Smiles, he had great Terror in his Frowns) 'I ſhall never ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Gentlemen you are pleaſed to think well of. I am ſure, Sir, ſuch Behaviour would very little become me, eſpecially when the Gentleman is your neareſt Relation; but, Sir, you muſt not be angry with me, you muſt not indeed, for my good Wiſhes to this poor Wretch. Sure, I may call him ſo now, though once you would have been angry with me, if I had ſpoke of him with the leaſt Diſreſpect. How often have I heard you call him your Son? How often have you prattled to me of him with all the Fondneſs of a Parent? Nay, Sir, I cannot forget the many tender Expreſſions, the many good Things you have told me of his Beauty, and his Parts, and his Virtues: of his Good-nature and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.—I am ſure, Sir, I cannot forget them: For I find them all true. I have experienced them in my own Cauſe. They have preſerved my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. You muſt pardon my Tears, Sir, indeed you muſt, when I conſider the cruel Reverſe of Fortune which this poor Youth, to whom I am ſo much obliged, hath ſuffered; when I conſider the Loſs of your Favour, which I know he valued more than his Life, I muſt, I muſt lament him. If you had a Dagger in your Hand, ready to plunge into my Heart, I muſt lament the Miſery of one whom you have loved, and I ſhall ever love.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> was pretty much moved with this Speech, but it ſeemed not to be with Anger: For after a ſhort Silence, taking Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> by the Hand, he ſaid very affectionately to her; <q rend="inline">'Come, Madam, let us conſider a little about your Daughter. I cannot blame you, for rejoicing in a Match which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0618300103:269"/>
to be advantageous to her; but you know this Advantage, in a great Meaſure, depends on the Father's Reconciliation. I know Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> very well, and have formerly had Concerns with him; I will make him a Viſit, and endeavour to ſerve you in this Matter. I believe he is a worldly Man; but as this is an only Son, and the Thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in Time be brought to Reaſon. I promiſe you I will do all I can for you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many were the Acknowledgments which the poor Woman made to <hi>Allworthy,</hi> for this Kind and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Offer, nor could ſhe refrain from taking this Occaſion again to expreſs her Gratitude towards <hi>Jones,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'to whom ſaid ſhe, I owe the Opportunity of giving you, Sir, this preſent Trouble.'</q> 
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> gently ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her; but he was too good a Man to be really of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Effects of ſo noble a Principle as now actuated Mrs. <hi>Miller;</hi> and indeed had not this new Affair inflamed his former Anger againſt <hi>Jones,</hi> it is poſſible he might have been a little ſoftened towards him by the Report of an Action which Malice itſelf could not have derived from an evil Motive.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> had been above an Hour together, when their Converſation was put an End to by the Arrival of <hi>Blifil,</hi> and another Perſon, which other Perſon was no leſs than Mr. <hi>Dowling,</hi> the Attorney, who was now become a great Favourite with Mr. <hi>Blifil,</hi> and whom Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> at the Deſire of his Nephew, had made his Steward, and had likewiſe recommended him to Mr. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> from whom the Attorney received a Promiſe of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the ſame Office upon the firſt Vacancy; and in the mean Time was employed in tranſacting ſome Affairs which the Squire then had in <hi>London,</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a Mortgage.</p>
               <p>This was the principal Affair which then brought Mr. <hi>Dowling</hi> to Town, therefore he took the ſame

Opportunity to charge himſelf with ſome Money for Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and to make a Report to him of ſome other Buſineſs; in all which as it was of much too dull a Nature to find any Place in this Hiſtory, we will leave the Uncle, Nephew, and their Lawyer concerned, and reſort to other Matters.</p>

               <p>BEFORE we return to Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> we will take one more View of <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though that young Lady had brought her Aunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great good Humour by thoſe ſoothing Methods, which we have before related, ſhe had not brought her in the leaſt to abate of her Zeal for the Match with Lord <hi>Fellamar;</hi> this Zeal was now inflamed by Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> who had told her the preceding Evening, that ſhe was well ſatisfied from the Conduct of <hi>Sophia,</hi> and from her Carriage to his Lordſhip, that all Delays would be dangerous, and that the only Way to ſucceed, was to preſs the Match forward with ſuch Rapidity, that the young Lady ſhould have no Time to reflect, and be obliged to conſent, while ſhe ſearce knew what ſhe did. In which Manner, ſhe ſaid, one half of the Marriages among People of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were brought about. A Fact very probably true, and to which I ſuppoſe is owing the mutual Tenderneſs which afterwards exiſts among ſo many happy Couples.</p>
               <p>A Hint of the ſame Kind was given by the ſame Lady to Lord <hi>Fellamar;</hi> and both theſe ſo readily embraced the Advice, that the very next Day was, at his Lordſhip's Requeſt, appointed by Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> for a private Interview between the young Parties. This was communicated to <hi>Sophia</hi> by her Aunt, and aſiſted upon in ſuch high Terms, that, after having ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged every Thing ſhe poſſibly could invent againſt it,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0618300103:271"/>
without the leaſt Effect, ſhe at laſt agreed to give the higheſt Inſtance of Complaiſance which any young Lady can give, and conſented to ſee his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>As Converſations of this Kind afford no great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, we ſhall be excuſed from reeiting the whole that paſt at-this Interview; in which, after, his Lordſhip had made many Declarations of the moſt pure and ardent Paſſions, to the ſilent, bluſhing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia;</hi> ſhe at laſt collected all the Spirits ſhe could raiſe, and with a trembling low Voice, ſaid, <q rend="inline">'My Lord, you muſt be yourſelf conſcious whether your former Behaviour to me hath been conſiſtent with the Profeſſions you now make.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Is there, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, no Way by which I can attone for Madneſs? What I did, I am afraid muſt have too plainly convinced you, that the Violence of Love had deprived me of my Senſes.'</q>

and perhaps it could not all be ſtrictly reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either to Senſe or Grammar; but he concluded his ranting Speech with ſaying, <q rend="inline">'That if ſhe has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged herſelf to any Gentleman, however unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it would make him, he ſhould think himſelf bound in Honour to deſiſt.'</q> Perhaps my Lord laid too much Emphaſis on the Word Gentleman; for we cannot elſe well account for the Indignation with which he inſpired <hi>Sophia,</hi> who, in her Anſwer, ſeemed greatly to reſent ſome Affront he had given her.</p>
               <p>While ſhe was ſpeaking, with her Voice more raiſed than uſual, Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> came into the Room, the Fire glaring in her Cheeks, and the Flames burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her Eyes. <q rend="inline">'I am aſhamed, ſays ſhe, my Lord, of the Reception which you have met with.

               <p>The Remainder of the Converſation between Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> and his Lordſhip, till the latter withdrew, conſiſted of bitter Lamentations on his Side, and on hers of the ſtrongeſt Aſſurances that her Neice ſhould and would conſent to all he wiſhed. <q rend="inline">'Indeed, my Lord, ſays ſhe, the Girl hath had a fooliſh Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither adapted to her Fortune nor her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Nothing elſe, my Lord, upon my Honour; I am convinced ſhe hath a good Underſtanding at the Bottom, and will be brought to Reaſon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This laſt Speech was made in the Abſence of <hi>Sophia,</hi> for ſhe had ſometime before left the Room with more
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0618300103:274"/>
Appearance of Paſſion than ſhe had ever ſhewn on any Occaſion; and now his Lordſhip, after many Expreſſions of Thanks to Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> many ardent Profeſſions of Paſſion which nothing could conquer, and many Aſſurances of Perſeverance which Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> highly encouraged, took his Leave for this Time.</p>
               <p>Before we relate what now paſſed between Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> and <hi>Sophia,</hi> it may be proper to mention an unfortunate Accident which had happened, and which had occaſioned the Return of Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> with ſo much Fury as we have ſeen.</p>
               <p>The Reader then muſt know, that the Maid who at preſent attended on <hi>Sophia,</hi> was recommended by Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> with whom ſhe had lived for ſome Time in the Capacity of a Comb-bruſh; ſhe was a very ſenſible Girl, and had received the ſtricteſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to watch her young Lady very carefully. Theſe Inſtructions, we are ſorry to ſay, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to her by Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> into whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> had now ſo ingratiated herſelf, that the violent Affection which the good Waiting-Woman had formerly borne to <hi>Sophia,</hi> was entirely obliterated by that great Attachment which ſhe had to her new Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Now when Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> was departed, <hi>Betty</hi> (for that was the Name of the Girl) returning to her young Lady, found her very attentively engaged in reading a long Letter, and the viſible Emotions which ſhe betrayed on that Occaſion, might have well account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome Suſpicions which the Girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a ſtronger Foundation, for ſhe had overheard the whole Scene which paſſed between <hi>Sophia</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Miller.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was acquainted with all this Matter by <hi>Betty,</hi> who, after receiving many Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſome Rewards for her Fidelity, was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if the Woman who brought the Letter, came
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0618300103:275"/>
again, ſhe ſhould introduce her to Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Unluckily Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> returned at the very time when <hi>Sophia</hi> was engaged with his Lordſhip. <hi>Betty,</hi> according to Order, ſent her directly to the Aunt; who being Miſtreſs of ſo many Circumſtances relating to what had paſt the Day before, eaſily impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor Woman to believe that <hi>Sophia</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the whole Affair; and ſo pumped every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing out of her which ſhe knew, relating to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and relating to <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This poor Creature might indeed be called Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity itſelf. She was one of that Order of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, who are apt to believe every thing which is ſaid to them; to whom Nature hath neither indulged the offenſive nor defenſive Weapons of Deceit, and who are conſequently liable to be impoſed upon by any one, who will only be at the Expence of a little Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood for that Purpoſe. Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> having drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> of all ſhe knew, which indeed was but little, but which was ſufficient to make the Aunt ſuſpect a great deal, diſmiſſed her, with Aſſurances that <hi>Sophia</hi> would not ſee her, that ſhe would ſend no Anſwer to the Letter, nor ever receive another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>To this peremptory Demand <hi>Sophia</hi> pauſed ſome Time before ſhe returned an Anſwer; and at laſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſed herſelf by declaring ſhe had not the Letter in her Pocket, which was indeed true; upon which her Aunt loſing all manner of Patience, aſked her Neice this ſhort Queſtion, whether ſhe would reſolve to marry Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> or no? to which ſhe receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtrongeſt Negative. Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> then replied with an Oath, or ſomething very like one, that ſhe would early the next Morning deliver her back into her Father's Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> then began to reaſon with her Aunt in the following manner; <q rend="inline">'Why, Madam, muſt I of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be forced to marry at all? conſider how cruel you would have thought it in your own Caſe, and how much kinder your Parents were in leaving you to your Liberty.

               <p>And now, my Friend, I take this Opportunity (as I ſhall have no other) of heartily wiſhing thee well. If I have been an entertaining Companion to thee, I promiſe thee it is what I have deſired. If in any Thing I have offended, it was really without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Jones</hi> having received the Letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold it, and indeed had ſcarce the Uſe of any one of his Faculties) <hi>Partridge</hi> took it up, and having received Conſent by Silence, read it likewiſe; nor had it upon him a leſs ſenſible Effect. The Pencil, and not the Pen, ſhould deſcribe the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which appeared in both their Countenances. While they both remained ſpeechleſs, the Turnkey entered the Room, and without taking any Notice of what ſufficiently diſcovered itſelf in the Faces of them both, acquainted <hi>Jones</hi> that a Man without deſired to ſpeak with him. This Perſon was preſently introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and was no other than Black <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Sights of Horror were not ſo uſual to <hi>George</hi> as they were to the Turnkey, he inſtantly ſaw the great Diſorder which appeared in the Face of <hi>Jones.</hi> This he imputed to the Accident that happened, which was reported in the very worſt Light in Mr. <hi>Weſtern'</hi>s Family; he concluded therefore that the Gentleman was dead, and that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was in a fair Way of coming to a ſhameful End. A Thought which gave him much Uneaſineſs; for <hi>George</hi> was of a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Diſpoſition, and notwithſtanding a ſmall Breach of Friendſhip which he had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not inſenſible of the Obligations he had formerly received from Mr. <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor Fellow therefore ſcarce refrained from a Tear at the preſent Sight. He told <hi>Jones</hi> he was heartily ſorry for his Misfortunes, and begged him to

                  <hi>Jones</hi> ſhook him very heartily by the Hand, and gave him many Thanks for the Kind Offer he had made; but anſwered, <q rend="inline">'He had not the leaſt Wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Madam <hi>Weſtern</hi> hath juſt brought Madam <hi>Sophia</hi> home, and there hath been a terrible to do. I could not poſſibly learn the very Right of it; but my Maſter he hath been in a vaſt big Paſſion, and ſo was Madam <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and I heard her ſay as ſhe went out of Doors into her Chair, that ſhe would never ſet her Foot in Maſter's Houſe again. I don't know what's the Matter, not I, but every thing was very quiet when I came out; but <hi>Robin,</hi> who waited at
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0618300103:292"/>
Supper, ſaid he had never ſeen the Squire for a long while in ſuch good Humour with young Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; that he kiſſed her ſeveral Times, and ſwore ſhe ſhould be her own Miſtreſs, and he never would think of confining her any more. I thought this News would pleaſe you, and ſo I ſlipp'd out, though it was ſo late, to inform you of it.'</q> Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> aſſured <hi>George</hi> that it did greatly pleaſe him; for though he ſhould never more preſume to lift his Eyes towards that incomparable Creature, nothing could ſo much relieve his Miſery as the Satisfaction he ſhould always have in hearing of her Welfare.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Converſation which paſſed at the Viſit is not important enough to be here related. The Reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleaſed to hear how this great good Will of the Squire towards his Daughter was brought about.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> on her firſt Arrival at her Brother's Lodging, began to ſet forth the great Honours and Advantages which would accrue to the Family by the Match with Lord <hi>Fellamar,</hi> which her Neice had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed; in which Refuſal, when the Squire took the Part of his Daughter, ſhe fell immediately into the moſt violent Paſſion, and ſo irritated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Squire, that neither his Patience nor his Prudence could bear any longer; upon which there enſued between them both ſo warm a Bout at Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that perhaps the Regions of <hi>Billingſgate</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver equalled it. In the Heat of this Scolding Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> departed, and had conſequently no Leiſure to acquaint the Brother with the Letter which <hi>Sophia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which might have poſſibly produced ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but to ſay the Truth I believe it never once occurred to her Memory at this Time.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was gone, <hi>Sophia,</hi> who had been hitherto ſilent, as well indeed from Neceſſity as Inclination, began to return the Compliment which
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0618300103:293"/>
her Father had made her, in taking her part againſt her Aunt, by taking his likewiſe againſt the Lady. This was the firſt Time of her ſo doing, and it was in the higheſt Degree acceptable to the Squire. Again he remembered that Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> had inſiſted on an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Relinquiſhment of all violent Means; and indeed as he made no doubt but that <hi>Jones</hi> would be hanged he did not in the leaſt queſtion ſucceeding with his Daughter by fair Means; he now therefore once more gave a Looſe to his natural Fondneſs for her, which had ſuch an Effect on the Dutiful, grateful, tender and Affectionate Heart of <hi>Sophia,</hi> that had her Honour given to <hi>Jones,</hi> and ſomething elſe perhaps in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether ſhe would not have ſacrificed herſelf to a Man ſhe did not like, to have obliged her Father. She promiſed him ſhe would make it the whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of her Life to oblige him, and would never marry any Man againſt his Conſent; which brought the old Man ſo near to his higheſt Happineſs, that he was reſolved to take the other Step, and went to Bed completely drunk.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Allworthy <hi>viſits old</hi> Nightingale; <hi>with a ſtrange Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that he made on that Occaſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Morning after theſe Things had happened, Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> went according to his Promiſe to viſit old <hi>Nightingale,</hi> with whom his Authority was ſo great, that after having ſat with him three Hours, he at laſt prevailed with him to conſent to ſee his Son.</p>
               <p>Here an Accident happened of a very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kind; one indeed of thoſe ſtrange Chances, whence very good and grave Men have concluded that Providence often interpoſes in the Diſcovery of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0618300103:294"/>
the moſt ſecret Villainy, in order to caution Men from quitting the Paths of Honeſty, however warily they tread in thoſe of Vice.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> at his Entrance into Mr. <hi>Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale'</hi>s, ſaw black <hi>George;</hi> he took no Notice of him, nor did Black <hi>George</hi> imagine he had perceived him. However, when their Converſation on the principal Point was over, <hi>Allworthy</hi> aſked <hi>Nightingale</hi> whether he knew one <hi>George Seagrim,</hi> and upon what Buſineſs he came to his Houſe. <q rend="inline">'Yes, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Nightingale,</hi> I know him very well, and a moſt extraordinary Fellow he is, who in theſe Days, hath been able to hoard up <hi>500l.</hi> from renting a very ſmall Eſtate of <hi>30l.</hi> a Year.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And is this the Story he hath told you? cries <hi>Allworthy.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay, it is true, I promiſe you,' ſaid <hi>Nightingale,</hi> 'for I have the Money now in my Hands, in five Bank Bills, which I am to lay out either in a Mortgage, or in ſome Purchaſe in the North of <hi>England.</hi>'</q> The Bank Bills were no ſooner produced at <hi>Allworthy'</hi>s Deſire, than he bleſſed himſelf at the Strangeneſs of the Diſcovery. He preſently told <hi>Nightingale</hi> that theſe Bank Bills were formerly his, and then acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the whole Affair. As there are no Men who complain more of the Frauds of Buſineſs than Highwaymen, Gameſters, and other Thieves of that Kind; ſo there are none who ſo bitterly exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Frauds of Gameſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Uſurers, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and other Thieves of this Kind; whether it be that the one Way of cheating is a Diſcountenance or Reflection upon the other, or that Money, which is the common Miſtreſs of all Cheats, makes them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard each other in the Light of Rivals; but <hi>Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> no ſooner heard the Story, than he exclaimed againſt the Fellow in Terms much ſeverer than the Juſtice and Honeſty of <hi>Allworthy</hi> had beſtowed on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0618300103:295"/>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> deſired <hi>Nightingale</hi> to retain both the Money and the Secret till he ſhould hear farther from him; and if he ſhould in the mean Time ſee the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he would not take the leaſt Notice to him of the Diſcovery which he had made. He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Lodgings, where he found Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> in a very dejected Condition, on Account of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſhe had received from her Son-in-law. Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> with great Chearfulneſs, told her that he had much good News to communicate; and with little further Preface, acquainted her, that he had brought Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> to conſent to ſee his Son, and did not in the leaſt doubt to effect a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between them; though he found the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſowered by another Accident of the ſame Kind, which had happened in his Family. He then mentioned the running away of the Uncle's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he had been told by the old Gentleman, and which Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> and her Son-in-law, did not yet know.</p>
               <p>The Reader may ſuppoſe Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> received this Account with great Thankfulneſs and no leſs Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but ſo uncommon was her Friendſhip to <hi>Jones,</hi> that I am not certain whether the Uneaſineſs ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for his Sake, did not over-ballance her Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at hearing a Piece of News tending ſo much to the Happineſs of her own Family; nor whether even this very News, as it reminded her of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations ſhe had to <hi>Jones,</hi> did not hurt as well as pleaſe her; when her grateful Heart ſaid to her, <q rend="inline">'While my own Family is happy, how miſerable is the poor Creature, to whoſe Generoſity we owe the Beginning of all this Happineſs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> having left her a little while to chew the Cud (if I may uſe that Expreſſion) on theſe firſt Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, told her, he had ſtill ſomething more to impart, which he believed would give her Pleaſure. <q rend="inline">'I think ſaid he, I have diſcovered a pretty conſiderable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

belonging to the young Gentleman, your Friend; but perhaps indeed, his preſent Situation may be ſuch, that it will be of no Service to him.'</q> The latter Part of the Speech gave Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> to underſtand who was meant, and ſhe anſwered with a Sigh, <q rend="inline">'I hope not, Sir.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I hope ſo too' cries <hi>Allworthy,</hi> 'with all my Heart, but my Nephew told me this Morning, he had heard a very bad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Affair.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Good Heaven!

You can teſtify the Affection I have formerly borne him. The World, I know, cenſured me for loving him ſo much. I did not withdraw that Affection from him without thinking I had the juſteſt Cauſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> I ſhould be glad to find I have been miſtaken.'</q> Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> was going ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to reply, when a Servant acquainted her, that a Gentleman without deſired to ſpeak with her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. <hi>Allworthy</hi> then enquired for his Nephew, and was told, that he had been for ſome Time in his Room with the Gentleman who uſed to come to him, and whom Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> gueſſing rightly to be Mr. <hi>Dowling,</hi> he deſired preſently to ſpeak with him.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Dowling</hi> attended, <hi>Allworthy</hi> put the Caſe of the Bank-Notes to him, without mentioning any Name, and aſked in what manner ſuch a Perſon might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. To which <hi>Dowling</hi> anſwered, he thought he might be indicted on the Black Act; but ſaid, as it was a Matter of ſome Nicety, it would be proper to go to Council. He ſaid he was to attend Council preſently upon an Affair of Mr. <hi>Weſtern'</hi>s, and if
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0618300103:297"/>
Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> pleaſed he would lay the Caſe before them. This was agreed to; and then Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> opening the Door, cry'd, <q rend="inline">'I aſk pardon, I did not know you had Company;'</q> but <hi>Allworthy</hi> deſired her to come in, ſaying, he had finiſhed his Buſineſs. Upon which Mr. <hi>Dowling</hi> withdrew, and Mrs. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> introduced Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> the younger, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks for the great Kindneſs done him by <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy;</hi> but ſhe had ſcarce Patience to let the young Gentleman finiſh his Speech before ſhe interrupted him, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'O Sir, Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> brings great News about poor Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> he hath been to ſee the wounded Gentleman, who is out of all Danger of Death, and what is more, declares he fell upon poor Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf, and beat him. I am ſure, Sir, you would not have Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> be a Coward. If I was a Man myſelf, I am ſure if any Man was to ſtrike me, I ſhould draw my Sword. Do pray, my Dear, tell Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> tell him all yourſelf.'</q> 
                  <hi>Nightingale</hi> then confirmed what Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> had ſaid; and concluded with many handſome Things of <hi>Jones,</hi> who was, he ſaid, one of the beſt-natured Fellows in the World, and not in the leaſt inclined to be quarrelſome. Here <hi>Nightingale</hi> was going to ceaſe, when Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> again begged him to related all the many dutiful Expreſſions he had heard him make uſe of towards Mr. <hi>Allworthy.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'To ſay the utmoſt Good of Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> cries <hi>Nightingale,</hi> is doing no more than ſtrict Juſtice, and can have no Merits in it; but indeed I muſt ſay, no Man can be more ſenſible of the Obligations he hath to ſo good a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

he would have his Conſcience upbraid him with one diſreſpectful, ungrateful, or undutiful Thought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. But I aſk pardon, Sir, I am afraid I preſume to intermeddle too far in ſo tender a Point.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You have ſpoke no more than what a Chriſtian ought, cries Mrs. <hi>Miller.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Mr. <hi>Nightingale,</hi> anſwered <hi>Allworthy,</hi> 'I applaud your generous Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and I wiſh he may merit it of you.

               <p>As the Anſwer which Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> made may lead us into freſh Matters, we will here ſtop to account for the viſible Alteration in Mr. <hi>Allworthy'</hi>s Mind, and the Abatement of his Anger to <hi>Jones.</hi> Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kind, it is true, do frequently occur in Hiſtories and dramatic Writers, for no other Reaſon than becauſe the Hiſtory or Play draws to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and are juſtified by Authority of Authors; yet though we inſiſt upon as much Authority as any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whatever, we ſhall uſe this Power very ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and never but when we are driven to it by Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which we do not at preſent foreſee will happen in this Work.</p>
               <p>This Alteration then in the Mind of Mr. <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi> was occaſioned by a Letter he had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                        <salute>My worthy Friend,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I informed you in my laſt, that I was forbidden the Uſe of the Waters, as they were found by Experience rather to encreaſe than leſſen the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of my Diſtemper. I muſt now acquaint you with a Piece of News, which, I believe, will afflict my Friends more than it hath afflicted me. Dr. <hi>Harrington</hi> and Dr. <hi>Brewſter,</hi> have informed me, that there is no Hopes of my Recovery.</p>
                     <p>I have ſomewhere read, that the great Uſe of Philoſophy is to learn to die. I will not therefore ſo far diſgrace mine, as to ſhew any Surprize at receiving a Leſſon which I muſt be thought to have ſo long ſtudied. Yet, to ſay the Truth, one Page of the Goſpel teaches this Leſſon better than all the Volumes of antient or modern Philoſophers. The Aſſurance it gives us of another Life is a much ſtronger ſupport to a good Mind, than all the Conſolations that are drawn from the Neceſſity of Nature, the Emptineſs or Satiety of our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, or any other Topic of thoſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations which are ſometimes capable of arming our Minds with a ſtubborn Patience in bearing the Thoughts of Death; but never of raiſing them to a real Contempt of it, and much leſs of making us think it a real Good. I would not here be underſtood to throw the horrid Cenſure of Atheiſm, or even the abſolute Denial of Immortality, on all who are called Philoſophers. Many of that Sect, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well antient as modern, have, from the Light of Reaſon, diſcovered ſome Hopes of a future State; but, in Reality, that Light was ſo faint and glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0618300103:300"/>
and the Hopes were ſo incertain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, that it may be juſtly doubted on which Side their Belief turned. <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf conludes his <hi>Phaedon,</hi> with declaring that his beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amount only to raiſe a Probability, and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> himſelf ſeems rather to profeſs an Inclination to believe, than any actual Belief in the Doctrines of Immortality. As to myſelf to be very ſincere with you, I never was much in earneſt in this Faith, till I was in earneſt a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>You will perhaps wonder at the latter Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I aſſure you it hath not been till very lately, that I could, with Truth, call myſelf ſo. The Pride of Philoſophy had intoxicated my Reaſon, and the ſublimeſt of all Wiſdom appeared to me, as it did to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of old, to be Fooliſhneſs. God hath however been ſo gracious to ſhew me my Error in Time, and to bring me into the Way of Truth, before I ſunk into utter Darkneſs for ever.</p>
                     <p>I find myſelf beginning to grow very weak, I ſhall therefore haſten to the main Purpoſe of this Letter.</p>
                     <p>When I reflect on the Actions of my paſt Life, I know of nothing which ſits heavier upon my Conſcience, than the Injuſtice I have been guilty of to that poor Wretch, your adopted Son. I have not indeed only connived at the Villany of others, but been myſelf active in Injuſtice towards him. Believe me, my dear Friend, when I tell you on the Word of a dying Man, he has been baſely injured. As to the principal Fact, upon the Miſrepreſentation of which you diſcarded him, I ſolemnly aſſure you he is innocent. When you lay upon your ſuppoſed Death-bed, he was the only Perſon in the Houſe who teſtified any real Concern; and what happened afterwards aroſe from the Wildneſs of his Joy on your Recovery;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0618300103:301"/>
and, I am ſorry to ſay it, from the Baſeneſs of another Perſon (but it is my Deſire to juſtify the Innocent, and to accuſe none). Believe me, my Friend, this young Man hath the nobleſt Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Heart, the moſt perfect Capacity for Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the higheſt Integrity, and indeed every Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which can ennoble a Man. He hath ſome Faults, but among them is not to be numbred the leaſt want of Duty or Gratitude towards you. On the contrary I am ſatisfied when you diſmiſſed him from your Houſe, his Heart bled for you more than for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Worldly Motives were the wicked and baſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my concealing this from you ſo long; to reveal it now I can have no Inducement but the Deſire of ſerving the Cauſe of Truth, of doing Right to the Innocent, and of making all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in my Power for a paſt Offence. I hope this Declaration therefore will have the Effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and will reſtore this deſerving young Man to your Favour; the hearing of which while I am yet alive will afford the utmoſt Conſolation to,</p>

                     <p>Had not my Hand been withheld from due Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, I had ſcourged much of this diabolical Spirit out of a Boy, of whom from his Infancy I diſcovered the Devil had taken ſuch entire Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but Reflections of this Kind now come too late.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> was of a cooler Diſpoſition than the good Woman, whoſe Spirits were all up in Arms in the Cauſe of her Friend. He was not however with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Suſpicions which were near a-kin to hers. When <hi>Blifil</hi> came into the Room, he aſked him with a very ſerious Countenance, and with a leſs friendly Look than he had ever before given him, <q rend="inline">'Whether he knew any Thing of Mr. <hi>Dowling'</hi>s having ſeen any of the Perſons who were preſent at the Duel between <hi>Jones</hi> and another Gentleman?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo dangerous as a Queſtion which comes by Surprize on a Man, whoſe Buſineſs it is to conceal Truth, or defend Falſhood. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thoſe worthy Perſonages, whoſe noble Office it is to ſave the Lives of their Fellow-Creatures at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> take the utmoſt Care, by frequent previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examination, to divine every Queſtion which may be aſked their Clients on the Day of Trial, that they may be ſupply'd with proper and ready Anſwers, which the moſt fertile Invention cannot ſupply in an Inſtant. Beſides, the ſudden and violent Impulſe on the Blood, occaſioned by theſe Surprizes, occaſions frequently ſuch an Alteration in the Countenance, that the Man is obliged to give Evidence againſt himſelf. And ſuch indeed were the Alterations which the Countenance of <hi>Blifil</hi> underwent from this ſudden Queſtion, that we can ſcarce blame the Eagerneſs of Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> who immediately cry'd out, <q rend="inline">'Guilty, upon my Honour! Guilty, upon my Soul!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> ſharply rebuked her for this Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity; and then turning to <hi>Blifil,</hi> who ſeemed ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Earth, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Why do you heſitate, Sir, at giving me an Anſwer? You certainly muſt have employed him, for he would not, of his own
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0618300103:307"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blifil</hi> then anſwered, <q rend="inline">'I own, Sir, I have been guilty of an Offence, yet may I hope your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?'</q>—<q rend="inline">'My Pardon?'</q> ſaid <hi>Allworthy</hi> very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily.—<q rend="inline">'Nay, Sir,' anſwered <hi>Blifil,</hi> 'I knew you would be offended; yet ſurely my dear Uncle will forgive the Effects of the moſt amiable of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Weakneſſes. Compaſſion for thoſe who do not deſerve it, I own, is a Crime; and yet it is a Crime from which you yourſelf are not entirely free. I know I have been guilty of it in more than one Inſtance to this very Perſon; and I will own I did ſend Mr. <hi>Dowling,</hi> not on a vain and fruitleſs Enquiry, but to diſcover the Witneſſes, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſoften their Evidence. This, Sir, is the Truth; which though I intended to conceal from you, I will not deny.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I confeſs,' ſaid <hi>Nightingale,</hi> 'this is the Light in which it appeared to me from the Gentleman's Behaviour.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Now, Madam,' ſaid <hi>Allworthy,</hi> 'I believe you will once in your Life own you have entertained a wrong Suſpicion, and are not ſo angry with my Nephew as you was.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> was ſilent; for though ſhe could not ſo haſtily be pleaſed with <hi>Blifil,</hi> whom ſhe looked upon to have been the Ruin of <hi>Jones,</hi> yet in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtance he had impoſed upon her as well as the reſt; ſo entirely had the Devil ſtood his Friend. And, indeed, I look upon the vulgar Obſervation, <hi>That the Devil often deſerts his Friends, and leaves them in the Lurch,</hi> to be a great Abuſe on that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Character. Perhaps he may ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert thoſe who are only his Cup Acquaintance; or who, at moſt, are but half his; but he generally ſtands by thoſe who are thoroughly his Servants, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0618300103:308"/>
helps them off in all Extremities 'till their Bargain expires.</p>
               <p>As a conquered Rebellion ſtrengthens a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or as Health is more perfectly eſtabliſhed by Recovery from ſome Diſeaſes; ſo Anger, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, often gives new Life to Affection. This was the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Allworthy;</hi> for <hi>Blifil</hi> having wiped off the greater Suſpicion, the leſſer, which had been raiſed by <hi>Square'</hi>s Letter, ſunk of Courſe, and was forgotten; and <hi>Thwackum,</hi> with whom he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, bore alone all the Reflections which <hi>Square</hi> had caſt on the Enemies of <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that young Man, the Reſentment of Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> began more and more to abate towards him. He told <hi>Blifil,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'he did not only forgive the extraordinary Efforts of his Good-Nature, but would give him the Pleaſure of following his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.'</q> Then turning to Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> with a Smile which would have become an Angel, he cry'd, <q rend="inline">'What ſay you, Madam; ſhall we take a Hackney-Coach, and all of us together pay a Viſit to your Friend? I promiſe you it is not the firſt Viſit I have made in a Priſon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Every Reader, I believe, will be able to anſwer for the worthy Woman; but they muſt have a great deal of Good-Nature, and be well acquainted with Friendſhip, who can feel what ſhe felt on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Few, I hope, are capable of feeling what now paſt in the Mind of <hi>Blifil;</hi> but thoſe who are, will acknowledge, that it was impoſſible for him to raiſe any Objection to this Viſit. Fortune, however, or the Gentleman lately mentioned above, ſtood his Friend, and prevented his undergoing ſo great a Shock: For at the very Inſtant when the Coach was ſent for, <hi>Partridge</hi> arrived, and having called Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> from the Company, acquainted her with the dreadful Accident lately come to Light; and hearing Mr. <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy'</hi>s
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0618300103:309"/>
Intention, begged her to find ſome Means of ſtopping him; for ſays he, <q rend="inline">'the Matter muſt at all Hazards be kept a Secret from him; and if he ſhould now go, he will find Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and his Mother, who arrived juſt as I left him, lamenting over one another the horrid Crime they have ignorantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The poor Woman, who was almoſt deprived of her Senſes at this dreadful News, was never leſs cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of Invention than at preſent. However, as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are much readier at this than Men, ſhe bethought herſelf of an Excuſe, and returning to <hi>Allworthy</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I am ſure, Sir, you will be ſurprized at hearing any Objection from me to the kind Propoſal you juſt now made; and yet I am afraid of the Conſequence of it, if carried immediately into Execution. You muſt imagine, Sir, that all the Calamities which have lately befallen this poor young Fellow, muſt have thrown him into the loweſt Dejection of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: And now, Sir, ſhould we all on a ſudden fling him into ſuch a violent Fit of Joy, as I know your Preſence will occaſion, it may, I am afraid, produce ſome fatal Miſchief, eſpecially as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who is without, tells me he is very far from being well.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'Is his Servant without?' cries <hi>Allworthy;</hi> 'pray call him hither. I will aſk him ſome Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Maſter.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> was at firſt afraid to appear before Mr. <hi>Allworthy;</hi> but was at length perſuaded, after Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> who had often heard his whole Story from his own Mouth, had promiſed to introduce him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> recollected <hi>Partridge</hi> the Moment he came into the Room, though many Years had paſſed ſince he had ſeen him. Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> therefore might have ſpared here a formal Oration, in which indeed ſhe was ſomewhat prolix: For the Reader, I believe,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0618300103:310"/>
may have obſerved already that the good Woman, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, had a Tongue always ready for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> then aſked him many Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Jones,</hi> as to his Health and other Matters; to all which <hi>Partridge</hi> anſwered, without having the leaſt Regard to what was, but conſidered only what he would have Things appear; for a ſtrict Adherence to Truth was not among the Articles of this honeſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's Morality or his Religion.</p>

She was pleaſed to ſay ſhe had heard an extraordinary Character of me for my Learning and ſuperior Underſtanding to all the young Women there, ſo ſhe was pleaſed to ſay. She then bid me come to her to the great Houſe, where when I attended, ſhe employed me to read to her. She expreſſed great Satisfaction in my reading, ſhewed great Kindneſs to me, and made me many Preſents. At laſt ſhe began to catechiſe me on the Subject of Secrecy, to which I gave her ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Anſwers, that at laſt having locked the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0618300103:318"/>
Door of her Room, ſhe took me into her Cloſet, and then locking that Door likewiſe, ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould convince me of the vaſt Reliance ſhe had on my Integrity, by communicating a Secret in which her Honour and conſequently her Life was concerned. She then ſtopt, and after a Silence of a Minute, during which ſhe often wiped her Eyes, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me, if I thought my Mother might ſafely be confided in. I anſwered I would ſtake my Life on her Fidelity. She then imparted to me the great Secret which laboured in her Breaſt, and which, I believe, was delivered with more Pains than ſhe afterwards ſuffered in Child-birth. It was then contrived, that my Mother and myſelf only ſhould attend at the Time, and that Mrs. <hi>Wilkins</hi> ſhould be ſent out of the Way, as ſhe accordingly was to the very furtheſt Part of <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Character of a Servant; for the Lady had turned away her own Maid near three Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, during all which Time I officiated about her Perſon, upon Trial as ſhe ſaid, tho', as ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declared, I was not ſufficiently handy for the Place. This and many other ſuch Things which ſhe uſed to ſay of me, were all thrown out to prevent any Suſpicion which <hi>Wilkins</hi> might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have when I was to own the Child; for ſhe thought it could never be believed ſhe would venture to hurt a young Woman with whom ſhe had intruſted ſuch a Secret. You may be aſſured, Sir, I was well paid for all theſe Affronts, which, together with being informed of the Occaſion of them, very well contented me. Indeed the Lady had a greater Suſpicion of Mrs. <hi>Wilkins</hi> than of any other Perſon; not that ſhe had the leaſt Averſion to the Gentlewoman, but ſhe thought her incapable of keeping a Secret, eſpecially from you, Sir: For I have often heard Miſs <hi>Bridget</hi> ſay, that if Mrs. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> had committed a Murder, ſhe believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0618300103:319"/>
ſhe would acquaint you with it. At laſt the expected Day came, and Mrs. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> who had been kept a Week in Readineſs, and put off from Time to Time, upon ſome Pretence or other, that ſhe might not return too ſoon, was diſpatched. Then the Child was born in the Preſence only of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and my Mother, and was by my Mother conveyed to her own Houſe, where it was privately kept by her till the Evening of your Return, when I, by the Command of Miſs <hi>Bridget</hi> conveyed it into the Bed where you found it.' And all Suſpicions were afterwards laid aſleep by the artful Conduct of your Siſter, in pretending Ill-will to the Boy, and that any Regard ſhe ſhew'd him was out of meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to you.'</q> Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> then made many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of the Truth of this Story, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Thus, Sir, you have at laſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your Nephew, for ſo I am ſure you will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after think him, and I queſtion not but he will be both an Honour and a Comfort to you under that Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.'</q>

She ſaid indeed, ſhe was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoiced that her Plot had ſucceeded ſo well, and that you had of your own accord taken ſuch a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Child, that it was yet unneceſſary to make any expreſs Declaration.

I have try'd um long enough. She muſt be frightned into it, there is no other Way. Tell her I'm her Father, and of the horrid Sin of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and of the dreadful Puniſhment of it in t'other World, and then tell her about being lock'd up all her Life in a Garret in this, and be kept on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Bread and Water.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I will do all I can, ſaid <hi>Allworthy,</hi> for I promiſe you there is nothing I wiſh more than an Alliance with this amiable Creature.'</q>

And if ſhe will but be obedient to me, there is no'orow a Father within a hundred Miles o' the Place that loves a Daughter better than I do; but I ſee you are buſy with the Lady here, ſo I will go Huome and expect you, and ſo your humble Servant.'</q>

I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderably altered ſince that Day when you ſo kindly gave me that Advice, which I had been happy had I followed.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Indeed, Madam, cries, <hi>Allworthy,</hi> 'it gave me great Concern when I firſt heard the contrary.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' ſays ſhe, 'I was ruined by a very deep Scheme of Villany, which if you knew, though I pretend not to think
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0618300103:324"/>
it would juſtify me in your Opinion, it would at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leaſt mitigate my Offence, and induce you to pity me; you are not now at Leiſure to hear my whole Story; but this I aſſure you, I was betrayed by the moſt ſolemn Promiſe, of Marriage; nay in the Eye of Heaven I was married to him; for after much reading on the Subject, I am convinced that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Ceremonies are only requiſite to give a legal Sanction to Marriage, and have only a worldly Uſe in giving a Woman the Privileges of a Wife; but that ſhe who lives conſtant to one Man, after a ſolemn private Affiance, whatever the World may call her, hath little to charge on her own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I am ſorry, Madam,' ſaid <hi>Allworthy,</hi> 'you made ſo ill an Uſe of your Learning. Indeed it would have been well that you had been poſſeſſed of much more, or had remained in a State of Ignorance. And yet, Madam, I am afraid you have more than this Sin to anſwer for.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'During his Life, anſwered ſhe, which was above a Dozen Years, I moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly aſſure you, I had not. And conſider, Sir, on my Behalf, what is in the Power of a Woman ſtript of her Reputation, and left deſtitute, whether the good-natured World will ſuffer ſuch a ſtray Sheep to return to the Road of Virtue, even if ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deſirous. I proteſt then I would have choſe it had it been in my Power; but Neceſſity drove me into the Arms of Capt. <hi>Waters,</hi> with whom, though ſtill unmarried, I lived as a Wife for many Years, and went by his Name. I parted with this Gentleman at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> on his March againſt the Rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who reſcued me from the Hands of a Villain. Indeed he is the worthieſt of Men. No young Gentleman of his Age is, I believe, freer from Vice, and few have the twentieth Part of his Virtues; nay, whatever Vices he hath had, I am firmly perſuaded he hath now taken a Reſolution to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0618300103:325"/>
abandon them.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I hope he hath, cries <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and I hope he will preſerve that Reſolution. I muſt ſay I have ſtill the ſame Hopes with Regard to yourſelf. The World, I do agree, are apt to be too unmerciful on theſe Occaſions, yet Time and Perſeverance will get the better of this their Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, as I may call it, to Pity, for though they are not, like Heaven ready to receive a penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet a continued Repentance will at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mercy even with the World. This you may be aſſured of, Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> that whenever I find you are ſincere in ſuch good Intentions, you ſhall want no Aſſiſtance in my Power to make them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> fell now upon her Knees before him, and in a Flood of Tears made him many moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Acknowledgments of his Goodneſs, which, as ſhe truely ſaid, ſavoured more of the divine than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> raiſed her up, and ſpoke in the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Manner, making uſe of every Expreſſion which his Invention could ſuggeſt to comfort her, when he was interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. <hi>Dowling,</hi> who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his firſt Entrance, ſeeing Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> ſtarted, and appeared in ſome Confuſion; from which he ſoon recovered himſelf as well as he could, and then ſaid, he was in the utmoſt Haſte to attend Council at Mr. <hi>Weſtern'</hi>s Lodgings; but however thought it his Duty to call and acquaint him with the Opinion of Council upon the Caſe which he had before told him, which was that the Converſion of the Moneys in that Caſe could not be queſtioned in a Criminal Cauſe, but that an Action of Trover might be brought, and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Jury to be the Moneys of Plaintiff, that Plaintiff would recover a Verdict for the Value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy,</hi> without making any Anſwer to this, bolted the Door, and then advancing with a ſtern Look to <hi>Dowling,</hi> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Whatever be your

                  <q rend="inline">'Nay, Sir, it is impoſſible to recollect eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Will you pleaſe, Madam, to aſſiſt the Gentleman's Memory?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'He told me, Sir, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> that if Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> had murdered my Huſband, I ſhould be aſſiſted by any Money I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry on the Proſecution, by a very worthy Gentleman, who was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with.

                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I cannot charge my Memory exactly, cries <hi>Dowling,</hi> but I believe I did ſpeak to that Purpoſe.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'And did Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> order you to ſay ſo?'</q>

ſay, that you would not have acted of your own Accord, and without Authority, in this Matter.—Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> then likewiſe ſent you to examine the two Fellows at <hi>Alderſgate?'</hi>
                  </q>—<q rend="inline">'He did, Sir,'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Well, and what Inſtructions did he then give you?

He ſaid, Blood required Blood; and that not only all who concealed a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, but thoſe who omitted any Thing in their Power to bring him to Juſtice, were Sharers in his Guilt. He ſaid, he found you was very deſirous of having the Villain brought to Juſtice, though it was not proper you ſhould appear in it.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Did he ſo?</q> ſays <hi>Allworthy.—</hi>
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, Sir, cries <hi>Dowling,</hi> I ſhould not, I am ſure, have proceeded ſuch Lengths for the ſake of any other Perſon living but your Worſhip.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'What Lengths, Sir,</q> ſaid <hi>Allworthy.—</hi>
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay, Sir, cries <hi>Dowling,</hi> I would not have your Worſhip think I would, on any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, be guilty of Subordination of Perjury; but there are two Ways of delivering Evidence.

I ſaid, we were told, that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> had aſſaulted the Gentleman firſt, and that if that was the Truth, they ſhould declare it; and I did give them ſome Hints that they ſhould be no Loſers.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'I think you went Lengths indeed,'</q> cries <hi>Allworthy.—</hi>

                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'—'The Letter, Sir, anſwered <hi>Dowling,</hi> which I brought from <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and which I delivered into the Hands of Mr. <hi>Blifil.'—'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O Heavens!' cries <hi>Allworthy,</hi> 'well, and what were the Words? What did my Siſter ſay to you?'</q>—<q rend="inline">'She took me by the Hand, anſwered he, and as ſhe delivered me the Letter, ſaid, I ſcarce know what I have written.

I preſently called in the People, and ſhe never ſpoke more to me, and dy'd within a few Minutes afterwards.'</q>
                  <hi>—Allworthy</hi> ſtood a Minute ſilent, lifting up his Eyes, and then turning to <hi>Dowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſaid,—<q rend="inline">'How came you, Sir, not to deliver me this Meſſage?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Your Worſhip, anſwered he, muſt remember that you was at that Time ill in Bed; and being in a violent Hurry, as indeed I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways am, I delivered the Letter and Meſſage to Mr. <hi>Blifil,</hi> who told me he would carry them both to you, which he hath ſince told me he did, and that your Worſhip, partly out of Friendſhip to Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and partly out of Regard to your Siſter, would never have it mentioned; and did intend to conceal it from the World; and therefore, Sir, if you had not mentioned it to me firſt, I am certain I
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0618300103:329"/>
ſhould never have thought it belonged to me to ſay any Thing of the Matter, either to your Worſhip, or any other Perſon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>We have remarked ſomewhere already, that it is poſſible for a Man to convey a Lie in the Words of Truth; this was the Caſe at preſent: For <hi>Blifil,</hi> had in Fact told <hi>Dowling</hi> what he now related; but had not impoſed upon him, nor indeed had imagined that he was able ſo to do. In Reality, the Promiſes which <hi>Blifil</hi> had made to <hi>Dowling,</hi> were the Motives which had induced him to Secrecy; and as he very plainly ſaw he ſhould not be able to keep them, he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per now to make this Confeſſion, which the Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Forgiveneſs, joined to the Threats, the Voice, the Looks of <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and the Diſcoveries he had made before, extorted from him, who was beſides taken unawares, and had no Time to conſider of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> appeared well ſatisfied with this Relation, and having enjoined ſtrict Silence as to what had paſt on <hi>Dowling,</hi> conducted that Gentleman himſelf to the Door, leaſt he ſhould ſee <hi>Blifil,</hi> who was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Chamber, where he exulted in the Thoughts of his laſt Deceit on his Uncle, and little ſuſpected what had ſince paſſed below Stairs.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Allworthy</hi> was returning to his Room, he met Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> in the Entry, who with a Face all pale and full of Terror, ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">'O! Sir, I find this wicked Woman hath been with you, and you know all; yet do not on this Account abandon the poor young Man. Conſider, Sir, he was ignorant it was his own Mother, and the Diſcovery itſelf will moſt probably break his Heart, without your Unkindneſs.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Madam, ſays <hi>Allworthy,</hi> I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch an Aſtoniſhment at what I have heard, that I am really unable to ſatisfy you; but come with me into my Room. Indeed, Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> I have made ſurpriſing Diſcoveries, and you ſhall ſoon know them.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0618300103:330"/>
The poor Woman followed him trembling; and now <hi>Allworthy</hi> going up to Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> took her by the Hand, and then turning to Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">'What Reward ſhall I beſtow upon this poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman for the Services ſhe hath done me?—O! Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> you have a Thouſand Times heard me call the young Man to whom you are ſo faithful a Friend, my Son. Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at all.—Your Friend, Madam, is my Nephew, he is the Brother of that wicked Viper which I ſo long nouriſhed in my Boſom.—She will herſelf tell you the whole Story, and how the Youth came to paſs for her Son. Indeed, Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> I am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that I have been abuſed, abuſed by one whom you too juſtly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of being a Villain. He is, in Truth, the worſt of Villains.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Joy which Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> now felt, bereft her of the Power of Speech, and might perhaps have deprived her of her Senſes, if not of Life, had not a friendly Shower of Tears come ſeaſonably to her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. At length recovering ſo far from her Tranſport as to be able to ſpeak, ſhe cry'd, <q rend="inline">'And is my dear Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> then your Nephew, Sir? and not the Son of this Lady? and are your Eyes opened to him at laſt? and ſhall I live to ſee him as happy as he deſerves?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'He certainly is my Nephew, ſays <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and I hope all the reſt.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'And is this the dear, good Woman, the Perſon, cries ſhe, to whom all this Diſcovery is owing!'</q>—<q rend="inline">'She is indeed, ſays <hi>Allworthy."</hi>
                  </q>—<q rend="inline">'Why then, cry'd Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> upon her Knees, may Heaven ſhower down its choiceſt Bleſſings upon her Head, and for this one good Action, forgive her all her Sins be they never ſo many.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> then informed them, that ſhe believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jones</hi> would very ſhortly be releaſed; for that the

               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> ſaid, he ſhould be glad to find his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew there at his Return home; but that he was then obliged to go on ſome Buſineſs of Conſequence. He than called to a Servant to fetch him a Chair, and preſently left the two Ladies together.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> hearing the Chair ordered, came down Stairs to attend upon his Uncle, for he never was deficient in ſuch Acts of Duty. He aſked his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle if he was going out, which is a civil Way of aſking a Man where he is going; to which the other making no Anſwer, he again deſired to know when he would be pleaſed to return.<hi>—Allworthy</hi> made no Anſwer to this neither, till he was juſt getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chair, and then turning about he ſaid—<q rend="inline">'Harkee, Sir, do you find out, before my Return, the Letter which your Mother ſent me on her Death-bed.'</q> 
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> then departed, and left <hi>Blifil</hi> in a Situation to be envied only by a Man who is juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be hanged.</p>

This is, I think, the Duty of a Child to a Parent; and this, I hope, nothing could ever have prevailed with me to ſwerve from.

To avoid a Force of this Kind, which I had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, I left my Father's Houſe, and ſought Protection elſewhere.

               <p>
                  <hi>Weſtern</hi> had been long impatient for the Event of this Conference, and was juſt now arrived at the Door to liſten; when having heard the laſt Sentiments of his Daughter's Heart, he loſt all Temper, and burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the Door in a Rage, cried out,—<q rend="inline">'It is a Lie.

Odzookers! Neighbour <hi>Allworthy,</hi> you don't know what it is to govern a Daughter.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Squire ended his Speech with ſome Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his own Sagacity; and then <hi>Allworthy,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a formal Preface, acquainted him with the whole Diſcovery which he had made concerning <hi>Jones,</hi> with his Anger to <hi>Blifil,</hi> and with every Particular which hath been diſcloſed to the Reader in the preceding Chapters.</p>
               <p>Men over-violent in their Diſpoſitions, are, for the moſt Part, as changeable in them. No ſooner then was <hi>Weſtern</hi> informed of Mr. <hi>Allworthy'</hi>s Intention to make <hi>Jones</hi> his Heir, than he joined heartily with the Uncle in every Commendation of the Nephew, and became as eager for her Marriage with <hi>Jones,</hi> as he had before been to couple her to <hi>Blifil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> was again forced to interpoſe, and to relate what had paſſed between him and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> at which he teſtified great Surprize.</p>
               <p>The Squire was ſilent a Moment, and looked wild with Aſtoniſhment at this Account—At laſt he cried out, <q rend="inline">'Why what can be the Meaning of this, Neighbour <hi>Allworthy?</hi> Vond o un ſhe was, that I'll be ſworn to.—Odzookers!

               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> now made a long Speech, in which he repeated his Reſolution to avoid all violent Meaſures, and very earneſtly recommended gentle Methods to Mr. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> as thoſe by which he might be aſſured of ſucceeding beſt with his Daughter. He then took his Leave, and returned back to Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> but

was forced to comply with the earneſt Entreaties of the Squire, in promiſing to bring Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to viſit him that Afternoon, <q rend="inline">'that he might,' as he ſaid, 'make all Matters up with the young Gentleman.'</q> At Mr. <hi>Allworthy'</hi>s Departure, <hi>Weſtern</hi> promiſed to follow his Advice in his Behaviour to <hi>Sophia,</hi> ſaying, <q rend="inline">'I don't know how 'tis, but d—n me, <hi>Allwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> if you don't make me always do juſt as you pleaſe, and yet I have as good an Eſteate as you, and am in the Commiſſion of the Peace as well as yourſelf.'</q>

               <p>WHEN <hi>Allworthy</hi> returned to his Lodgings, he heard Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was juſt arrived before him. He hurried therefore inſtantly into an empty Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whither he ordered Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to be brought to him alone.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to conceive a more tender or mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scene, than the Meeting between the Uncle and Nephew, (for Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> as the Reader may well ſuppoſe, had at her laſt Viſit diſcovered to him the Secret of his Birth). The firſt Agonies of Joy which were felt on both Sides, are indeed beyond my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deſcribe: I ſhall not therefore attempt it.

To be again reſtored to your Preſence, to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; to be once more thus kindly received by my great, my noble, my generous Benefactor,</q>—<q rend="inline">'Indeed, Child,' cries <hi>Allworthy,'</hi> I have uſed you cruelly.'</q>—He then explained to him all the Treachery of <hi>Blifil,</hi> and again repeated Expreſſions of the utmoſt Concern, for having been induced by that Treachery to uſe him ſo ill. <q rend="inline">'O talk not ſo,' anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jones;'</hi> 'Indeed Sir, you have uſed me nobly.

Alas, Sir, I have not been puniſhed more than I have deſerved; and it ſhall be the whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of my furture Life to deſerve that Happineſs you now beſtow on me; for believe me, my dear Uncle, my Puniſhment hath not been thrown away upon me. Though I have been a great, I am not a hardened Sinner; I thank Heaven I have had Time to reflect on my paſt Life, where though I cannot charge myſelf with any groſs Villainy, yet I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Follies and Vices too ſufficient to repent and to be aſhamed of; Follies which have been attended with dreadful Conſequences to myſelf, and have brought me to the Brink of Deſtruction.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I am rejoiced, my dear Child,' anſwered <hi>Allworthy,</hi> to hear you talk thus ſenſibly; for as I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocriſy (good Heaven how have I been impoſed on by it in others!) was never among your Faults,

ſo I can readily believe all you ſay. You now ſee, <hi>Tom,</hi> to what Dangers Imprudence alone may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Virtue (for Virtue, I am now convinced, you love in a great Degree). Prudence is indeed the Duty which we owe to ourſelves; and if we will be ſo much our own Enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the World is deficient in diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duty to us; for when a Man lays the Foundation of his own Ruin, others will, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, be too apt to build upon it. You ſay, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you have ſeen your Errors; and will reform them. I firmly believe you, my dear Child; and therefore, from this Moment, you ſhall never more be reminded of them by me. Remember them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yourſelf ſo far, as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them; but ſtill remember, for your Comfort, that there is this great Difference between thoſe Faults which Candour may conſtrue into Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, and thoſe which can be deduced from Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy only. The former, perhaps, are even more liable to ſubject a Man to Ruin; but if he reform, his Character will, at length, be totally retrieved; the World, though not immediately, will, in Time, be reconciled to him; and he may reflect, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Mixture of Pleaſure, on the Dangers he hath eſcaped: But Villainy, my Boy, when once diſcovered, is irretrievable; the Stains which this leaves behind, no Time will waſh away. The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Mankind will purſue the Wretch, their Scorn will abaſh him in Public, and if Shame drives him into Retirement, he will go to it with all thoſe Terrors with which a weary Child, who is afraid of Hobgoblins, retreats from Company to go to Bed alone. Here his murdered Conſcience will haunt him. Repoſe, like a falſe Friend, will fly from him. Where-ever he turns his Eyes, Horror preſents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if he looks backward, unavailable Repentance
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0618300103:343"/>
treads on his Heels; if forward, incurable Deſpair ſtares him in the Face; till, like a condemned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, confined in a Dungeon, he deteſts his preſent Condition, and yet dreads the Conſequence of that Hour which is to relieve him from it. Comfort yourſelf, I ſay, my Child, that this is not your Caſe; and rejoice, with Thankfulneſs to him who hath ſuffered you to ſee your Errors, before they have brought on you that Deſtruction to which a Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in even thoſe Errors muſt have led you. You have deſerted them, and the Proſpect now before you is ſuch, that Happineſs ſeems in your own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.'</q>—At theſe Words <hi>Jones</hi> fetched a deep Sigh; upon which, when <hi>Allworthy</hi> remonſtrated, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Sir, I will conceal nothing from you: I fear there is one Conſequence of my Vices I ſhall never be able to retrieve.

                  <q rend="inline">'I will not flatter you, Child,' cries <hi>Allworthy;</hi> I fear your Caſe is deſperate: I never ſaw ſtronger Marks of an unalterable Reſolution in any Perſon, than appeared in her vehement Declarations againſt receiving your Addreſſes; for which, perhaps, you can account bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than myſelf.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Oh, Sir! I can account too well,' anſwered <hi>Jones;</hi> 'I have ſinned againſt her beyond all Hope of Pardon; and, guilty as I am, my Guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten Times blacker than the real Colours.

               <p>A Servant now acquainted them, that Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was below Stairs; for his Eagerneſs to ſee <hi>Jones</hi> could not wait till the Afternoon. Upon which <hi>Jones,</hi> whoſe Eyes were full of Tears, begged his Uncle to entertain <hi>Weſtern</hi> a few Minutes, till he a little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf: To which the good Man conſented, and having ordered Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> to be ſhewn into a Parlour, went down to him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> no ſooner heard, that <hi>Jones</hi> was alone (for ſhe had not yet ſeen him ſince his Releaſe from Priſon,) than ſhe came eagerly into the Room, and, advancing towards <hi>Jones,</hi> wiſhed him heartily Joy of his new-found Uncle, and his happy Reconciliation; adding, <q rend="inline">'I wiſh I could give you Joy on another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, my dear Child; but any thing ſo inexorable I never ſaw.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> with ſome Appearance of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, aſked her, what ſhe meant. <q rend="inline">'Why then,' ſays ſhe, 'I have been with your young Lady, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0618300103:345"/>
have explained all Matters to her, as they were told me by my Son <hi>Nightingale.</hi> She can have no longer any Doubt about the Letter, that I am certain; for I told her my Son <hi>Nightingale</hi> was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take his Oath, if ſhe pleaſed, that it was all his own Invention, and the Letter of his inditing. I told her the very Reaſon of ſending the Letter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her Account, and a plain Proof, that you was reſolved to quit all your Profligacy for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that you had never been guilty of a ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Infidelity to her ſince your ſeeing her in Town. I am afraid I went too far there; but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forgive me: I hope your future Behaviour will be my Juſtification. I am ſure I have ſaid all I can; but all to no Purpoſe. She remains inflexible. She ſays, ſhe had forgiven many Faults on account of Youth; but expreſſed ſuch Deteſtation of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Libertine, that ſhe abſolutely ſilenced me. I often attempted to excuſe you; but the Juſtneſs of her Accuſation flew in my Face. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Honour ſhe is a lovely Woman, and one of the ſweeteſt and moſt ſenſible Creatures I ever ſaw. I could have almoſt kiſſed her for one Expreſſion ſhe made uſe of. It was a Sentiment worthy of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> or of a Biſhop.' "I once fancied, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,' ſaid ſhe, "I had diſcovered great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart in Mr. <hi>Jones;</hi> and for that I own I had a ſincere Eſteem; but an entire Profligacy of Manners will corrupt the beſt Heart in the World; and all which a good-natured Libertine can expect is, that we ſhould mix ſome Grains of Pity with our Contempt and Abhorrence."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'She is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic Creature, that is the Truth on't.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'O Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> can I bear to think I have loſt ſuch an Angel.</q>—<q rend="inline">'Lost!

Hopes: Nay, if ſhe ſhould remain inexorable, there is another young Lady, a ſweet pretty young Lady, and a ſwinging Fortune, who is abſolutely dying for Love of you. I heard of it this very Morning, and I told it to Miſs <hi>Weſtern;</hi> nay, I went a little beyond the Truth again; for I told her you had refuſed her; but indeed I knew you would refuſe her.—And here I muſt give you a little Comfort: When I mentioned the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Name, who is no other than the pretty Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>Hunt,</hi> I thought ſhe turned pale; but when I ſaid you had refuſed her, I will be ſworn her Face was all over Scarlet in an Inſtant; and theſe were her very Words,' "I will not deny but that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he has ſome Affection for me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Converſation was interrupted by the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of <hi>Weſtern,</hi> who could no longer be kept out of the Room even by the Authority of <hi>Allworthy,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; though this, as we have often ſeen, had a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power over him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſtern</hi> immediately went up to <hi>Jones,</hi> crying out, <q rend="inline">'My old Friend <hi>Tom,</hi> I am glad to ſee thee with all my Heart. All paſt muſt be forgotten. I could not intend any Affront to thee, becauſe, as <hi>Allwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> here knows, nay, doſt know it thyſelf, I took thee for another Perſon; and where a Body means no Harm, what ſignifies a haſty Word or two; one Chriſtian muſt forget and forgive another.'</q>

               <p>The Converſation which now enſued was pleaſant enough; and with which, had it happened earlier in our Hiſtory, we would have entertained our Reader; but as we have now Leiſure only to attend to what is very material, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being intirely adjuſted as to the Afternoon-Viſit, Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> again returned home.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>This Hiſtory draws nearer to a Concluſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEN Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was departed, <hi>Jones</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to inform Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> that his Liberty had been procured by two noble Lords, who, together with two Surgeons, and a Friend of Mr. <hi>Nightingale'</hi>s, had attended the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on the Surgeons Oaths that the wounded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was out of all Manner of Danger from this Wound, he was diſcharged.</p>
               <p>One only of theſe Lords, he ſaid, he had ever ſeen before, and that no more than once; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had greatly ſurprized him, by aſking his Pardon for an Offence he had been guilty of towards him, occaſioned, he ſaid, entirely by his Ignorance who he was.</p>
               <p>Now the Reality of the Caſe with which <hi>Jones</hi> was not acquainted till afterwards, was this. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant whom Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> had employed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Advice of Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> to preſs <hi>Jones,</hi> as a Vagabond, into the Sea Service, when he came to report the Event which we have before ſeen to his Lordſhip, ſpoke very favourably of the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> on all Accounts, and ſtrongly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0618300103:348"/>
that Lord, that he muſt have miſtaken the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for that <hi>Jones</hi> was certainly a Gentleman, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that his Lordſhip, who was ſtrictly a Man of Honour, and would by no Means have been guilty of an Action which the World in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he had taken.</p>
               <p>Within a Day or two after this, Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> happened to dine with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer, who, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation upon the Duel, acquainted his Company with the Character of <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> to which indeed he did not do ſtrict Juſtice, eſpecially in what related to his Lady. He ſaid, ſhe was the moſt innocent, and moſt injured Woman alive, and that from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion alone he had undertaken her Cauſe. He then declared an Intention of going the next Morning to <hi>Fitzpatrick'</hi>s Lodgings, in order to prevail with him, if poſſibly, to conſent to a Separation from his Wife, who, the Peer ſaid, was in Apprehenſions for her Life, if ſhe ſhould ever return to be under the Power of her Huſband. Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> agreed to go with him, that he might ſatisfy himſelf more concerning <hi>Jones,</hi> and the Circumſtances of the Duel; for he was by no Means eaſy concerning the Part he had acted. The Moment his Lordſhip gave a Hint of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to aſſiſt in the Delivery of the Lady, it was eagerly embraced by the other Nobleman, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended much on the Authority of Lord <hi>Fellamar,</hi> as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi> into a Compliance; and perhaps he was in the right; for the poor <hi>Iriſhman</hi> no ſooner ſaw theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peers had undertaken the Cauſe of his Wife, than he ſubmitted, and Articles of Separation were ſoon drawn up and ſigned between the Parties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> had been ſo well ſatisfied by Mrs. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> concerning the Innocence of his Wife with <hi>Jones</hi> at <hi>Upton,</hi> or perhaps from ſome other Reaſons, was now become ſo indifferent to that Matter, that he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0618300103:349"/>
ſpoke highly in Favour of <hi>Jones,</hi> to Lord <hi>Fellamar,</hi> took all the Blame upon himſelf, and ſaid the other had behaved very much like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour; and upon that Lord's further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning Mr. <hi>Jones, Fitzpatrick</hi> told him he was Nephew to a Gentleman of very great Faſhion and Fortune, which was the Account he had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> after her Interview with <hi>Dowling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Fellamar</hi> now thought it behoved him to do every Thing in his Power to make Satisfaction to a Gentleman whom he had ſo groſly injured, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conſideration of Rivalſhip, (for he had now given over all Thoughts of <hi>Sophia)</hi> determined to procure Mr. <hi>Jones'</hi>s Liberty, being ſatisfied as well from <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> as his Surgeon, that the Wound was not mortal. He therefore prevailed with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer to accompany him to the Place where <hi>Jones</hi> was confined, to whom he behaved as we have already related.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Allworthy</hi> returned to his Lodgings, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carried <hi>Jones</hi> into his Room, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the whole Matter, as well what he had heard from Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> as what he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from Mr. <hi>Dowling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> expreſſed great Aſtoniſhment, and no leſs Concern at this Account; but without making any Comment or Obſervation upon it. And now a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was brought from Mr. <hi>Blifil,</hi> deſiring to know if his Uncle was at Leiſure, and he might wait upon him. <hi>Alworthy</hi> ſtarted and turned pale, and then in a more paſſionate Tone than, I believe, he had ever uſed before, bid the Servant tell <hi>Blifil,</hi> he knew him not. <q rend="inline">'Conſider, dear Sir,'</q>—cries <hi>Jones</hi> in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Voice.—<q rend="inline">'I have conſidered, anſwered <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi> and you yourſelf ſhall carry my Meſſage to the Villain.—No one can carry him the Sentence

of his own Ruin ſo properly as the Man whoſe Ruin he hath ſo villainouſly contrived.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Pardon me, dear Sir, ſaid <hi>Jones;</hi> a Moment's Reflection will, I am ſure, convince you of the contrary. What might be perhaps but Juſtice from another Tongue, would from mine be Inſult; and to whom?—My own Brother, and your Nephew.—Nor did he uſe me ſo barbarouſly.—Indeed that would have been more inexcuſeable than any Thing he hath done. Fortune may tempt Men of no very bad Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Injuſtice; but Inſults proceed only from black and rancorous Minds, and have no Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to excuſe them.—Let me beſeech you, Sir, to do nothing by him in the preſent Height of your Anger. Conſider, my dear Uncle, I was not my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf condemned unheard.'</q> 
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> ſtood ſilent a Moment, and then embracing <hi>Jones,</hi> he ſaid, with Tears guſhing from his Eyes, <q rend="inline">'O my Child! to what Goodneſs have I been ſo long blind!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> entring the Room at that Moment, after a gentle Rap, which was not perceived, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jones</hi> in the Arms of his Uncle, the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in an Agony of Joy, fell upon her Knees, and burſt forth into the moſt extatic Thankſgivings to Heaven, for what had happened. —Then run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jones,</hi> ſhe embraced him eagerly, crying, <q rend="inline">'My deareſt Friend, I wiſh you Joy a Thouſand and a Thouſand Times of this bleſt Day;'</q> and next Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> himſelf received the ſame Congratulations. To which he anſwered, <q rend="inline">'Indeed, indeed, Mrs. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> I am beyond Expreſſion happy.'</q> Some few more Raptures being paſſed on all Sides, Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> deſired them both to walk down to Dinner in the Parlour, where ſhe ſaid there were a very happy Set of People aſſembled; being indeed no other than Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> and his Bride, and his Couſin <hi>Harris</hi> with her Bridegroom.</p>

                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> excuſed himſelf from dining with the Company, ſaying he had ordered ſome little Thing for him and his Nephew in his own Apartment; for that they had much private Buſineſs to diſcourſe of, but would not reſiſt promiſing the good Woman, that both he and <hi>Jones</hi> would make Part of her Society at Supper.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> then aſked what was to be done with <hi>Blifil;</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'for indeed, ſays ſhe, I cannot be eaſy while ſuch a Villain is in my Houſe.</q>—<hi>Allworthy</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q rend="inline">'He was as uneaſy as herſelf on the ſame Account.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'There will be no need of any Violence, cries <hi>Allworthy,</hi> if you will carry him a Meſſage from me, he will, I am convinced, depart of his own Accord.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Will I? ſaid Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> I never did any Thing in my Life with a better Will.'</q> Here <hi>Jones</hi> interfered, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'He had conſidered the Matter better, and would, if Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> pleaſed, be himſelf the Meſſenger.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I know, ſays he, already enough of your Pleaſure, Sir, and I beg Leave to acquaint him with it by my own Words. Let me beſeech you, Sir, added he, to reflect on the dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of driving him to violent and ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. How unfit, alas! is this poor Man to die in his preſent Situation.'</q> This Suggeſtion had not the leaſt Effect on Mrs. <hi>Miller.</hi> She left the Room cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="inline">'You are too good, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> infinitely too good to live in this World.'</q> But it made a deeper Impreſſion on <hi>Allworthy.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My good Child, ſaid he, I am equally aſtoniſhed at the Goodneſs of your Heart, and the Quickneſs of your Underſtanding. Heaven indeed forbid that this Wretch ſhould be deprived of any Means or Time for Repentance.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0618300103:352"/>
That would be a ſhocking Conſideration indeed. Go to him therefore, and uſe your own Diſcretion; yet do not flatter him with any Hopes of my Forgiveneſs; for I ſhall never forgive Villainy farther than my Religion obliges me, and that extends not either to our Bounty or our Converſation.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> went up to <hi>Blifil'</hi>s Room, whom he found in a Situation which moved his Pity, though it would have raiſed a leſs amiable Paſſion in many Beholders. He had caſt himſelf on his Bed, where he lay aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning himſelf to Deſpair, and drowned in Tears; not in ſuch Tears as flow from Contrition, and waſh away Guilt from Minds which have been ſeduced or ſurprized into it unawares, againſt the Bent of their natural Diſpoſitions, as will ſometimes happen from human Frailty, even to the Good: No, theſe Tears were ſuch as the frighted Thief ſheds in his Cart, and are indeed the Effects of that Concern which the moſt ſavage Natures are ſeldom deficient in feeling for themſelves.</p>
               <p>It would be unpleaſant and tedious to paint this Scene in full Length. Let it ſuffice to ſay, that the Behaviour of <hi>Jones</hi> was kind to Exceſs. He omitted nothing which his Invention could ſupply, to raiſe and comfort the drooping Spirits of <hi>Blifil,</hi> before he communicated to him the Reſolution of his Uncle, that he muſt quit the Houſe that Evening. He offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to furniſh him with any Money he wanted, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his hearty Forgiveneſs of all he had done againſt him, that he would endeavour to live with him hereafter as a Brother, and would leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted to effectuate a Reconciliation with his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blifil</hi> was at firſt ſullen and ſilent, balancing in his Mind whether he ſhould yet deny all: But finding at laſt the Evidence too ſtrong againſt him, he betook himſelf at laſt to confeſſion. He then aſked Pardon of his Brother in the moſt vehement Manner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0618300103:353"/>
himſelf on the Ground, and kiſſed his Feet: In ſhort, he was now as remarkably mean, as he had been before remarkably wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> could not ſo far check his Diſdain, but that it a little diſcovered itſelf in his Countenance at this extreme Servility. He raiſed his Brother the Moment he could from the Ground, and adviſed him to bear his Afflictions more like a Man; repeating, at the ſame Time, his Promiſes, that he would do all in his Power to leſſen them: For which <hi>Blifil</hi> making many Profeſſions of his Unworthineſs, poured forth a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Thanks: And then he having declared he would immediately depart to another Lodging, <hi>Jones</hi> returned to his Uncle.</p>
               <p>Among other Matters, <hi>Allworthy</hi> now acquainted <hi>Jones</hi> with the Diſcovery which he made concerning the 500 <hi>l.</hi> Bank-Notes. <q rend="inline">'<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>I have,' ſaid he, 'already conſulted a Lawyer, who tells me, to my great Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that there is no Puniſhment for a Fraud of this Kind.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Good Heaven!' ſays <hi>Jones,</hi> 'is it poſſible?—I am ſhocked beyond Meaſure at this News. I thought there was not an honeſter Fellow in the World.—The Temptation of ſuch a Sum was too great for him to withſtand; for ſmaller Matters have come ſafe to me through his Hand. Indeed, my dear Uncle, you muſt ſuffer me to call it Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than Ingratitude; for I am convinced the poor Fellow loves me, and hath done me ſome Kindneſs, which I can never forget; nay, I believe he hath repented of this very Act: For it is not above a Day or two ago, when my Affairs ſeemed in the moſt deſperate Situation, that he viſited me in my Confinement, and offered me any Money I wanted.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0618300103:354"/>
Conſider, Sir, what a Temptation to a Man who had taſted ſuch bitter Diſtreſs, it muſt be to have a Sum in his Poſſeſſion, which muſt put him and his Family beyond any future Poſſibility of ſuffering the like.'</q>

And give me Leave to ſay, when we ſuffer any Temptation to atone for Diſhoneſty itſelf, we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be; and ſo far I confeſs I have gone: for I have often pitied the Fate of a Highwayman, when I have been on the Grand Jury; and have more than once applied to the Judge on the Behalf of ſuch as have had any mitigating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in their Caſe; but when Diſhoneſty is attended with any blacker Crime, ſuch as Cruelty, Murder, Ingratitude, or the like, Compaſſion and Forgiveneſs then become Faults.

               <p>This was ſpoke with ſo ſtern a Voice, that <hi>Jones</hi> did not think proper to make any Reply: Beſides, the Hour appointed by Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> now drew ſo near that he had barely Time left do dreſs himſelf. Here therefore ended the preſent Dialogue, and <hi>Jones</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to another Room, where <hi>Partridge</hi> attended, according to order, with his Cloaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> had ſcarce ſeen his Maſter ſince the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Diſcovery. The poor Fellow was unable either to contain or expreſs his Tranſports.

His Memory, however, was not in the leaſt defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. He recollected now many Omens and Preſages of this happy Event, ſome of which he had remarked at the Time, but many more he now remembered; nor did he omit the Dreams he had dreamt the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before his meeting with <hi>Jones;</hi> and concluded with ſaying, <q rend="inline">'I always told your Honour ſomething boded in my Mind, that you would one Time or other have it in your Power to make my Fortune.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, that this Boding ſhould as certainly be verified with regard to him, as all the other Omens had been to himſelf; which did not a little add to all the Raptures which the poor Fellow had already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on account of his Maſter.</p>

                  <hi>JONES</hi> being now completely dreſſed, attended his Uncle to Mr. <hi>Weſtern'</hi>s. He was indeed one of the fineſt Figures ever beheld, and his Perſon alone would have charmed the greater Part of Womankind; but we hope it hath already appeared in this Hiſtory, that Nature, when ſhe formed him, did not totally rely, as ſhe ſometimes doth, on this Merit only, to recommend her Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> who, angry as ſhe was, was likewiſe ſet forth to the beſt Advantage, for which I leave my female Reader to account, appeared ſo extremely beautiful, that even <hi>Allworthy,</hi> when he ſaw her, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear whiſpering <hi>Weſtern,</hi> that he believed ſhe was the fineſt Creature in the World.

The Tea-table was ſcarce removed, before <hi>Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> lugged <hi>Allworthy</hi> out of the Room, telling him, <q rend="inline">'He had Buſineſs of Conſequence to impart, and muſt ſpeak to him that Inſtant in private before he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it.'</q>

               <p>The Lovers were now alone, and it will, I queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not, appear ſtrange to many Readers, that thoſe who had ſo much to ſay to one another when Danger and Difficulty attended their Converſation, and who ſeemed ſo eager to ruſh into each others Arms when ſo many Bars lay in their Way, now that with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were at Liberty to ſay or do whatever they pleaſed, ſhould both remain for ſome Time ſilent and motionleſs; inſomuch, that a Stranger of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent: But ſo it was, however ſtrange it may ſeem; both ſat with their Eyes caſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the Ground, and for ſome Minutes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in perfect Silence.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> during this Interval, attempted once or twice to ſpeak, but was abſolutely incapable, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering only, or rather, ſighing out ſome broken Words: when <hi>Sophia</hi> at length, partly out of Pity to him, and partly to turn the Diſcourſe from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which ſhe knew well enough he was endeavouring to open, ſaid:—</p>

               <p>YOUNG <hi>Nightingale</hi> had been that Afternoon by Appointment to wait on his Father who received him much more kindly than he expected. There likewiſe he met his Uncle, who was returned to Town in queſt of his new married Daughter.</p>
               <p>This Marriage was the luckieſt Incident which could have happened to the young Gentleman; for theſe Brothers lived in a conſtant Contention about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of their Children, both heartily deſpiſing the Method which each other took. Each of them therefore now endeavoured as much as he could to palliate the Offence which his own Child had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and to aggravate the Match of the other. This Deſire of triumphing over his Brother, added to the many Arguments which <hi>Allworthy</hi> had uſed, ſo ſtrongly operated on the old Gentleman, that he met his Son with a ſmiling Countenance, and actually
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0618300103:364"/>
agreed to ſup with him that Evening at Mrs. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler'</hi>s.</p>
               <p>As for the other, who really loved his Daughter with the moſt immoderate Affection, there was little Difficulty in inclining him to a Reconciliation. He was no ſooner informed by his Nephew where his Daughter and her Huſband were, than he declared he would inſtantly go to her. And when he arrived there, he ſcarce ſuffered her to fall upon her Knees, before he took her up, and embraced her with a Tenderneſs which affected all who ſaw him; and in leſs than a Quarter of an Hour was as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to both her and her Huſband, as if he had himſelf joined their Hands.</p>
               <p>In this Situation were Affairs when Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> and his Company arrived to complete the Happineſs of Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> who no ſooner ſaw <hi>Sophia,</hi> than ſhe gueſſed every Thing that had happened; and ſo great was her Friendſhip to <hi>Jones,</hi> that it added not a few Tranſports to thoſe ſhe felt on the Happineſs of her own Daughter.</p>
               <p>There have not, I believe, been many Inſtances of a number of People met together, where every one was ſo perfectly happy, as in this Company. Amongſt whom the Father of young <hi>Nightingale</hi> enjoyed the leaſt perfect Content; for notwithſtanding his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Son, notwithſtanding the Authority and the Arguments of <hi>Allworthy,</hi> together with the other Motive mentiond before, he could not ſo entirely be ſatisfied with his Son's Choice; and perhaps the Preſence of <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf tended a little to aggravate and heighten his Concern, as a Thought now and then ſuggeſted itſelf, that his Son might have had that Lady, or ſome ſuch other. Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Perſon or Mind of <hi>Sophia,</hi> created the Uneaſineſs: It was the Contents of her Father's Coffers which ſet his Heart a longing.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0618300103:365"/>
Theſe were the Charms which he could not bear to think his Son had ſacrificed to the Daughter of Mrs. <hi>Miller.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Brides were both very pretty Women; but ſo totally were they eclipſed by the Beauty of <hi>Sophia,</hi> that had they not been two of the beſt-tempered Girls in the World, it would have raiſed ſome Envy in their Breaſts; for neither of their Huſbands could long keep his Eyes from <hi>Sophia,</hi> who ſat at the Table like a Queen receiving Homage, or rather like a ſuperior Being receiving Adoration from all around her. But it was an Adoration which they gave, not which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted: For ſhe was as much diſtinguiſhed by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Affability, as by all her other Perfections.</p>
               <p>The Evening was ſpent in much true Mirth. All were happy, but thoſe the moſt, who had been moſt unhappy before. Their former Sufferings and Fears gave ſuch a Reliſh to their Felicity, as even Love and Fortune in their fulleſt Flow could not have given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Advantage of ſuch a Compariſon. Yet as great Joy, eſpecially after a ſudden Change and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of Circumſtances, is apt to be ſilent, and dwells rather in the Heart than on the Tongue, <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Sophia</hi> appeared the leaſt merry of the whole Company. Which <hi>Weſtern</hi> obſerved with great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience often crying out to them, <q rend="inline">'Why do'ſt not talk Boy! Why do'ſt look ſo grave! Haſt loſt thy Tongue Girl! Drink another Glaſs of Wine, ſha't drink another Glaſs?</q> And the more to enliven her, he would ſometimes ſing a merry Song, which bore ſome Relation to Matrimony, and the Loſs of a Maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded ſo far on that Topic, as to have driven her out of the Room, if Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> had not checkt him ſometimes by Looks, and once or twice by a <hi>Fie! Mr. Weſtern.</hi> He began indeed once to debate the Matter, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his Right to talk to his own Daughter as he thought
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0618300103:366"/>
fit: but as no Body ſeconded him, he was ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Order.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this little Reſtraint, he was ſo pleaſed with the Chearfulneſs and Good-Humour of the Company, that he inſiſted on their meeting the next Day at his Lodgings. They all did ſo; and the lovely <hi>Sophia,</hi> who was now in private become a Bride too, officiated as the Miſtreſs of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or, in the polite Phraſe, did the Honours of the Table. She had that Morning given her Hand to <hi>Jones,</hi> in the Chapel at <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> were the only Perſons preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> had earneſtly deſired her Father, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Company, who were that Day to dine with him, ſhould be acquainted with her Marriage. The ſame Secrecy was enjoined to Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> undertook for <hi>Allworthy.</hi> This ſome what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the Delicacy of <hi>Sophia</hi> to the public Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, which, in Compliance with her Father's Will, ſhe was obliged to go to, greatly againſt her own Inclinations. In Confidence of this Secrecy, ſhe went through the Day pretty well, till the Squire, who was now advanced into the ſecond Bottle, could contain his Joy no longer, but, filling out a Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, drank a Health to the Bride. The Health was immediately pledged by all preſent, to the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of poor bluſhing <hi>Sophia,</hi> and the great Concern of <hi>Jones</hi> upon her Account. To ſay Truth, there was not a Perſon preſent made wiſer by this Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for Mrs. <hi>Miller</hi> had whiſpered it to her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, her Daughter to her Huſband, her Huſband to his Siſter, and ſhe to all the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> now took the firſt Opportunity of withdraing with the Ladies, and the Squire ſat in to his Cups, in which he was, by Degrees, deſerted by all the Company, except the Uncle of young <hi>Nightingale,</hi> who loved his Bottle as well as <hi>Weſtern</hi> himſelf.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0618300103:367"/>
Theſe two therefore ſat ſtoutly to it, during the whole Evening, and long after that happy Hour which had ſurrendered the charming <hi>Sophia</hi> to the eager Arms of her enraptured <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Reader, we have at length brought our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to a Concluſion, in which, to our great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, tho' contrary perhaps to thy Expectation, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> appears to be the happieſt of all human Kind: For what Happineſs this World affords equal to the Poſſeſſion of ſuch a Woman as <hi>Sophia,</hi> I ſincerely own I have never yet diſcovered.</p>
               <p>As to the other Perſons who have made any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Figure in this Hiſtory, as ſome may deſire to know a little more concerning them, we will proceed in as few Words as poſſible, to ſatisfy their Curioſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> hath never yet been prevailed upon to ſee <hi>Blifil,</hi> but he hath yielded to the Importunity of <hi>Jones,</hi> backed by <hi>Sophia,</hi> to ſettle 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; to which <hi>Jones</hi> hath privately added a third. Upon this Income he lives in one of the northern Counties, about 200 Miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> and lays up 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year out of it, in order to purchaſe a Seat in the next Parliament from a neighbouring Borough, which he has bargained for with an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney there. He is alſo lately turned Methodiſt, in hopes of marrying a very rich Widow of that Sect, whoſe Eſtate lies in that Part of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Square</hi> died ſoon after he writ the before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Letter; and as to <hi>Thwackum,</hi> he continues at his Vicarage. He hath made many fruitleſs Attempts to regain the Confidence of <hi>Allworthy,</hi> or to ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Jones,</hi> both of whom he flatters to their Faces, and abuſes behind their Backs. But in his ſtead, Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> hath lately taken Mr. <hi>Abraham Adams</hi> into his Houſe, of whom <hi>Sophia</hi> is grown immoderately fond, and declares he ſhall have the Tuition of her Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0618300103:368"/>
Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> is ſeparated from her Huſband, and retains the little Remains of her Fortune. She lives in Reputation at the polite End of the Town, and is ſo good an Oeconomiſt, that ſhe ſpends three Times the Income of her Fortune, without running in Debt. She maintains a perfect Intimacy with the Lady of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer; and in Acts of Friendſhip to her repays all the Obligations ſhe owes to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was ſoon reconciled to her Niece <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> and hath ſpent two Months together with her in the Country. Lady <hi>Bellaſton</hi> made the latter a formal Viſit at her Return to Town, where ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved to <hi>Jones,</hi> as to a perfect Stranger, and with great Civility, wiſhed him Joy on his Marriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nightingale</hi> hath purchaſed an Eſtate for his Son in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Jones,</hi> where the young Gentleman, his Lady, Mrs. <hi>Miller,</hi> and her little Daughter reſide, and the moſt agreeable Intercourſe ſubſiſts between the two Families.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe of lower Account, Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Country, had a Penſion of 60 <hi>l.</hi> a Year ſettled upon her by Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Parſon <hi>Supple,</hi> on whom, at the Inſtance of <hi>Sophia, Weſtern</hi> hath beſtowed a conſiderable Living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Black George</hi> hearing the Diſcovery that had been made, run away, and was never ſince heard of; and <hi>Jones</hi> beſtowed the Money on his Family, but not in equal Proportions, for <hi>Molly</hi> had much the greateſt Share.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Partridge, Jones</hi> hath ſettled 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year on him; and he hath again ſet up a School, in which he meets with much better Encouragement than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and there is now a Treaty of Marriage on Foot, between him and Miſs <hi>Molly Seagrim,</hi> which through the Mediation of <hi>Sophia,</hi> is likely to take Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0618300103:369"/>
We now return to take Leave of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Sophia,</hi> who, within two Days after their Marriage, attended Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> and Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> into the Country. <hi>Weſtern</hi> hath reſigned his Family Seat, and the greater Part of his Eſtate to his Son-in-law, and hath retired to a leſſer Houſe of his, in another Part of the Country, which is better for Hunting. Indeed he is often as a Viſitant with Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who as well as his Daughter, hath an infinite Delight in doing every Thing in their Power to pleaſe him. And this Deſire of theirs is attended with ſuch Succeſs, that the old Gentleman declares he was never happy in his Life till now. He hath here a Parlour and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to himſelf, where he gets drunk with whom he pleaſes, and his Daughter is ſtill as ready as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to play to him whenever he deſires it; for <hi>Jones</hi> hath aſſured her, that as next to pleaſing her, one of his higheſt Satisfactions is to contribute to the Happineſs of the old Man; ſo the great Duty which ſhe expreſſes and performs to her Father renders her almoſt equally dear to him, with the Love which ſhe beſtows on himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> hath already produced him two fine Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a Boy and a Girl, of whom the old Gentleman is ſo fond, that he ſpends much of his Time in the Nurſery, where he declares the tattling of his little Grand-Daughter, who is above a Year and half old, is ſweeter Muſic than the fineſt Cry of Dogs in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> was likewiſe greatly liberal to <hi>Jones</hi> on the Marriage, and hath omitted no Inſtance of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Affection to him and his Lady, who love him as a Father. Whatever in the Nature of <hi>Jones</hi> had a Tendency to Vice, has been corrected by continual Converſation with this good Man, and by his Union with the lovely and virtuous <hi>Sophia.</hi> He has alſo, by Reflexion on his paſt Follies, acquired a Diſcretion
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0618300103:370"/>
and Prudence very uncommon in one of his lively Parts.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as there are not to be found a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier Man and Woman, than this fond Couple, ſo neither can any be imagined more happy. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the pureſt and tendereſt Affection for each other, an Affection daily encreaſed and confirmed by mutual Eſteem. Nor is their Conduct towards their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Friends leſs amiable, than towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſuch is their Condeſcenſion, their Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and their Beneficence to thoſe below them, that there is not a Neighbour, a Tenant, or a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who doth not moſt gratefully bleſs the Day when Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was married to <hi>Sophia.</hi>
