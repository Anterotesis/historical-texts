            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>THE common error of moſt of our modern writers on beauty has been, that they have ſuppoſed all things, in order to appear completely beautiful, ſubject to one fixed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple relative only to ſenſe; ſuch as, ſhape or proportion. Books have been written in ſupport of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and variety; terms compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the nature of all things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than containing a deſcription alone of what is beautiful: others to perſuade us in favour of ſoftneſs and ſmoothneſs, and of a ſerpentine line of beauty. Propriety has alſo been aſſigned as the cauſe of beauty: but, ſince there are many things which ſtrike us as beautiful before we diſcern their uſefulneſs, propriety can at beſt be admitted a concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0857400100:4"/>
not an efficient cauſe, of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Concerning matters of taſte, we appeal to the feelings of the heart, rather than to the abilities of the head. Taſte prevents judgment, and is more beholden to ſentiment than to experience. There is, however, a perfect agreement between right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and true taſte: they are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal teſts of each other's validity; ſince we are not ſatisfied that ſuch things pleaſe, but are apt to inquire into the cauſes and effects of this pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we allow its authenticity. This has led many to believe, that beauty depends on propriety or fitneſs; tho' it muſt be confeſſed, a toad is as fit for the purpoſes of its nature as a turtle-dove: and we may remark of artificial ornaments, that they are moſtly of little or no utility. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is beauty itſelf the ſame with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0857400100:5"/>
goodneſs; but rather what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſenſe, aſſociated with an expreſſion of goodneſs. To define beauty by ſoftneſs and ſmoothneſs, and the doctrine of mere lines, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it to the notion of ſimple ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; but ſurely one may ſee and hear, without the perceptions of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and harmony peculiar to delicacy of ſentiment? For whatever beauty we may perceive in the ſubordinate objects of ſenſe, it muſt be confeſſed, it is an expreſſion of the finer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to which we owe the higheſt pleaſures of beauty. And as it is the ſocial or communicative principle which raiſes our enjoyments ſo far above the pleaſures of other creatures, ſo it is the viſible ſigns appropriated by nature to this principle, which render the human body ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautiful.</p>

                  <p>QUALITIES of objects, ſo far as they relate to beauty, are either ſuch as moſt clearly excite <hi>perception</hi> or <hi>life</hi> in the ſenſes; or they are compoſed of theſe, and ſomewhat <hi>expreſſive</hi> of <hi>life</hi> or <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.</hi>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0857400100:8"/>As the natural love of life, or the conſciouſneſs of exiſtence, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all animal-pleaſure; ſo the firſt and ſimpleſt of our ſenſations, and of which our primary ideas are chiefly compounded, are light, ſound, and motion. Their oppoſites, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſilence, and reſt, are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſive of horror, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their ſimilarity to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſight and of hearing, or to the extinction of thoſe perceptions which principally conſtitute the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple idea of animation.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">

                  <head>SECT. II. Of LIGHT.</head>
                  <p>ALL the powers of ſenſe may be referred to that of feeling; all the perceptible qualities of bodies may be reſolved into motion. Sight is the feeling of the eye; its percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions depend on the vibrations of ſome finer medium, which produce the ſenſation of light. The greateſt beauty of light, as confined to ſenſe, ſeems to be the oppoſition of its three principal modifications, red, blue, and yellow; or their various changes and gentle gradations, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the feathers of a peacock,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0857400100:10"/>
the priſm, or the rainbow: a ſpecies of which we alſo perceive in flowers, and to which they are much beholden for their tender effect.</p>
                  <p>Colours are beautiful or pleaſing as their various contraſts yield a livelier ſenſation of light, and heighten per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; the colder tints, and thoſe that approach to darkneſs, improving the lighter, and ſuch as are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of warmth and of life.</p>
                  <p>So far as the effects of light or darkneſs apply to the expreſſion of human character, we may obſerve, that, in the turbulent agitations of the mind, the features accumulate a greater degree of ſhade; the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0857400100:11"/>
aſſumes a dark and cloudy appearance. Gloomy, livid, and black, are complexions ſuitable to horror, deſpair, and death.</p>
                  <p>Our ideas of light, and of heat, are originally and cloſely connected. That etherial fire which is the life, is alſo the light, of the world. The mellow and amber-coloured light, ſuch as is ſometimes ſeen in a ſerene evening-ſky, while it is moſt delicious to ſight, is, of all colours, moſt expreſſive of the wholeſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of warmth congenial to life, or to the kindly and delicious of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; eſpecially when contraſted by its oppoſite, black, or deep violet.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0857400100:12"/>
The bluiſh pale of the human coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, proper to expreſſions of fear, conveys an idea of coldneſs; and is that of chilly winter, or of ſhaded ſnow. An appearance of violent heat, is expreſſive of the violence of paſſion. Anger is denoted by a deep and fiery red. The thunder is thrown by the red right-hand of JOVE.<q>
                        <l>—while his thunders dire,</l>
                        <l>With red right-hand, at his own temples hurl'd,</l>
                        <l>With fear and horror ſhook the guilty world.</l> 
                        <bibl>FRANCIS'S HORACE.</bibl>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mellow and gentle tones of colour aſſociate with, and diſpoſe to, the gentle and delicate of internal feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; harſh and ſharp ones, with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0857400100:13"/>
rude and diſagreeable emotions. Faint, pale, and bluiſh tints, are fitted to expreſs fearfulneſs, and a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the powers of life: ſtrong and fiery ones, to ſignify paſſions of a ſtrong and contrary nature; the violent of the ſenſes ever aſſociating with, and diſpoſing to, the violent or diſagreeable of internal ſenſation.</p>
                  <p>This analogy might alſo be traced in the operations of the other ſenſes, ſmelling, taſting, and feeling. Things that are inſipid to taſte, that dull the palate, or act on it with violence, are ever ungrateful. That certain degree of ſoftneſs and ſmoothneſs, that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſiſtance, by means of which we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0857400100:14"/>
beſt perceive, will ever be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to feeling. Smells alſo may be ranged under the volatile or lively, and the dull. Beſide the ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſing quality of the poppy when taken into the ſtomach, the ſmell is heavy and deleterious; all ſuch ſmells, therefore, will aſſociate with ſilence, reſt, darkneſs, and vacuity. Bitter or ſour things that violently aſtringe the palate, things harſh to the touch, or that are too ſtrong for ſmelling, affect the hoſtile or diſcordant of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But as ideas of beauty chiefly refer to perceptions of ſight and of hearing, we ſhall confine our reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions particularly to thoſe ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0857400100:15"/>It is remarkable, there is a cloſe analogy between the principal ſigns of life, and the ſimple or primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſenſe; the chief characteriſtics of life being heat, voice, and motion: ſo that, ſtrictly ſpeaking, whatever objects ſuggeſt the ſenſations ſimilar to the qualities we perceive in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are the actual and principal cauſes of pleaſure even in the ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>It is light alone by which the eye enjoys its pleaſures of perception; it is light, again, reflected from the eye, to which it owes its ſuperior vivacity and expreſſion. A gentle, yet clear, variation of colour or form, is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſight, as that of ſound is to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0857400100:16"/>
hearing; and it is by means of ſuch variations that we communicate our ſentiments of pleaſure.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III. Of SOUND.</head>
                  <p>WE have already obſerved, that ſound is one of the firſt or ſimple ſenſations; and that an idea of perfect ſilence is accompanied with horror, eſpecially when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with darkneſs and univerſal reſt, as theſe are analogous to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſenſe: we ſhall therefore paſs to the conſideration of ſympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0857400100:17"/>
or the variations of ſound as they are exemplified in muſical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>Of ſounds, the mellow, ſoft, and gentle, are moſt pleaſing to ſenſe, and beſt adapted to expreſs the gentle of ſentiment. Deep tones aſſociate with deepneſs of ſhade, and with ſlowneſs of motion. The loud, the ſharp, and the ſhrill, rank with the other ruder cauſes of perception.</p>
                  <p>The moſt refined melody is that which accords with gracefulneſs of ſentiment: it is chiefly employed in quieting the turbulent, and ſoothing the gentler, emotions. The coarſer paſſions are excited by ſomething
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0857400100:18"/>
that deſerves the name of noiſe or diſcord, rather than of muſic. As the violent emotions increaſe, ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is diminiſhed; as the gentler ones increaſe, ſentiment is improved.</p>
                  <p>In common diſcourſe, which treats of indifferent ſubjects, and conſiſts moſtly of narrative, the voice natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclines to a ſettled monotony, or at beſt riſes to a ſort of recitative: as converſation becomes more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, the variations of voice are proportionally increaſed. Artificial muſic is an imitation of theſe natural variations, as they are more or leſs expreſſive of paſſion, or of all thoſe tender depreſſions and rapturous ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0857400100:19"/>
of the ſoul, when the pours herſelf forth in generous ecſtaſy: thoſe notes and combinations which pleaſe the ear, being adapted to the pleaſing of paſſion; the ſad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant, as in the paſſions themſelves, to ſet off the more melodious and cheerful: for our joys are continually mingled with abatement or with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and are beſt perceived by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of contraſt; gravity of ſound being an approach to ſilence, as ſhade to darkneſs, and as ſlowneſs of motion is a drawing nearer to reſt. We cannot judge of any thing but by relation, and it is in the <hi>changes</hi> of things that we perceive them.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0857400100:21"/>
it is evidently the eye which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Milton, to expreſs the winding ſhape of the honeyſuckle, calls it <hi>the flaunting honeyſuckle.</hi> Thus, beauty of figure becomes a kind of ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for elegance of motion.</p>
                  <p>To the moſt delicate ſentiments there are certain kindred forms, ſounds, and motions, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſociate with, and are beſt calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to expreſs, ſuch tenderneſs of ſentiment. As it is, in ſome ſenſe, alike whether the eye or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject moves, and it is plain that quick turnings in animals indicate a more ſudden exertion of the living power than ſlow ones, it will likewiſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0857400100:22"/>
follow, that wherever the eye over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes lines running abruptly into contrary directions, ſuch lines will convey an idea of the ſudden changes of paſſion; though it is not they that move, but the fight which moves along them; ſince every appearance we have experienced to hold an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with life, transferring the emotion to the cauſe, we are apt to conceive is inſpired with paſſion: thus we ſay, light is cheerful, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſprightly, or ſounds are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic.</p>
                  <p>Bodies apparently maſſy and opake are underſtood to be heavy, to affect reſt, and conſequently ſilence. The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0857400100:23"/>
                     <hi>too much</hi> is as incomprehenſible as the <hi>too little,</hi> and a certain degree of greatneſs ſtrikes us much in the ſame manner as vacuity: thus the ideas of vaſt magnitude, obſcurity, gravity, and ſtillneſs, will ever naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to aſſociate.</p>
                  <p>The determination of bodies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is accompanied with a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of liberty and ſprightlineſs. The riſing foliage of the Corinthian capital makes the column ſeem to bear its ſuperſtructure, not only with eaſe, but with cheerfulneſs. Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of elevated paſſion are, the head thrown up, the arms raiſed above the head, like thoſe Bacchanalian fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0857400100:24"/>
we ſee ſo often repreſented in the antique. Humility and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpirit are expreſſed by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a contrary and liſtleſs kind, or rather by languor and ſuſpenſion of action.</p>
                  <p>The coarſer and more violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are to be expreſſed by rudeneſs and extravagance of motion, abrupt changes of form and of colour. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den turnings and contortions are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of pain, or belong to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of paſſion. An action ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic, yet gentle, is appropriated to emotions of the higheſt pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Muſic has alſo its counterpart in action: dancing is the muſic of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0857400100:25"/>
Muſic and dancing expreſs the ſame thing, only in different ways: the art of dancing teaches to regulate the various movements and geſtures of the body to the humour of the muſic, both anſwering to the ſentiment by which they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inſpired.</p>
                  <p>And in this way even inanimate matter, either by being put in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſo ordered as to invite the eye to move, is made to engage the attention, and to affect the paſſions, agreeable to the ſigns of ſuch paſſions in ourſelves; whence all our ideas of form originate, and whither alſo they return by reflection.</p>

                  <p>THOUGH we have no percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but what originate from our ſenſes, yet ſtill it is life which pleaſes, whether enjoyed by the ſtrong and clear images of ſenſe, or whether the impreſſions of theſe, mingling into ſentimental harmony, are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the more refined plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of imagination; our ideas, by <hi>aſſimilation</hi> and <hi>contraſt,</hi> improving in ſtrength, mutually aſſiſting each other, and increaſing affection, till at length we attain the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of <hi>moral perception.</hi>

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0857400100:27"/>What is generally underſtood by harmony, relates properly to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but there is in nature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the human mind, a ſyſtem of univerſal ſymphony carried on by means of aſſimilation and contraſt, ſince there is an attractive as well as a repelling power in every thing that concerns our ſentiments and ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The theory of aſſociation may be divided into the agreement of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or qualities reſpecting any ſingle ſenſe; among various ſenſes; of thoſe of ſenſe with characters of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and among various characters, animated or expreſſive.—Thus, as an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0857400100:28"/>
inſtance of the firſt kind, gentleneſs of form, of colour, and of motion, incline to aſſociate.</p>
                  <p>Things that accord with reſpect to different ſenſes, are ſuch as excite an equal degree of perception, or a like degree of animation; every thing that is delicate to touch, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with that particular ſhape, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, and modulation of ſound, which agree to form an aſſemblage that is gently engaging. The ſweet, ſoft notes of the aeolian harp admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably agree with the ſtill ſoftneſs of moon-light. The agreeable of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, figure, ſmell, and touch, are united by nature in flowers; which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0857400100:29"/>
is the reaſon they are ſo delicately pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>When more of the ſenſes than one are employed at the ſame time, they naturally act in uniſon; and their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent powers are to be conſidered as tending to excite unity of ſentiment: to ſet them in oppoſition, therefore, would be to deſtroy the uniformity and energy of their effect.</p>
                  <p>Things of different kinds aſſociate by ſome particular and ſtriking ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; things of like general diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by ſome peculiar difference or contraſt. Human characters being included in this laſt kind, aſſociate by their diverſity of expreſſion.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0857400100:30"/>
Trees, ſhrubs, and plants, are to be conſidered as a diſtinct ſpecies of leſs perfect characters; and there is an agreement between a proper aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of theſe and human cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, or their particular virtues or paſſions perſonified: every thing of the clear or animated kind ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attract that which is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, in any degree, of a like diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and to form a whole, that, by means of its variety or internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſts, yields the cleareſt and moſt perfect object of perception.</p>
                  <p>What pleaſes any one ſenſe, comes as it were recommended to the reſt. What is beautiful, we are diſpoſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0857400100:31"/>
to think is good; what is good, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. Though here we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſtinguiſh between the good, and the beautiful; between notions of wholeſomeneſs or utility, and that which produces an immediate ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleaſure. Reſpecting the latter, we appeal more directly to the innate and original powers of ſenſe: for the former, to experience; which teaches us, that what is moſt beautiful is not ever the beſt, nor that which is leſs beholden to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour always the moſt uſeleſs or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. The perpendicular wall of a houſe is good, becauſe it implies ſtability; but it is not therefore
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0857400100:32"/>
beautiful: on the contrary, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental part ſtrikes us not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any otherwiſe uſeful than that it immediately pleaſes. The wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaves of plants frequently exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit a colouring more agreeable to the eye, than when they are freſh and blooming. The ſmoke iſſuing from the chimney of a country cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage cannot, ſurely, be underſtood to poſſeſs any great appearance of beauty; but the object pleaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conveys a lively idea of the ſnug happineſs and warmth of the people within. Other objects, tho' really good or uſeful, have nothing in them very pleaſing to ſenſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0857400100:33"/>
do they bear any external marks of ſenſibility, and therefore cannot be ſaid to partake of beauty. Even with regard to the human character, we do not find that virtue ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the faireſt form.</p>
                  <p>Things that are aſſociated, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, with pleaſing objects, though in themſelves not agreeable, become, by ſuch habitual aſſociation, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, provided the balance be on the agreeable ſide; but. the lineal and ſpeckled beauty of the ſerpent will not eaſily command our attention, ſo long as the horror continues with which that animal ſtrikes us.</p>
                  <p>With a lively ſentiment, lively
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0857400100:34"/>
images of ſenſe will naturally aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate; with the agreeable of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what is agreeable of the former: pleaſing aſſociations in the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other than images and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo diſpoſed as to heighten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal perception.</p>

                  <p>WITHOUT motion, light, and ſound, all our perceptions of ſight and hearing muſt be at an end:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0857400100:37"/>
but it is neceſſary, to render ſight viſible, that there be darkneſs; as it is requiſite, to render ſound audible, that there be ſilence; and that there be reſt, to ſhow that there is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>There is clearly a relation between time and ſpace; and it has much the ſame effect, whether a great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be oppoſed to a ſmall light, or a long-continued darkneſs to a light of ſhort duration. Every thing ſeems to ſuffer an alteration from the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of time and place; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the compariſon of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive incidents, or by the oppoſition
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0857400100:38"/>
of preſent circumſtances by which qualities are compared.</p>
                  <p>The preciſe effect of any object to the eye, depends either on its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate oppoſition to other objects, or on the more remote relation it bears to ſuch as are retained by memory. This may be further explained by harmony and melody, in muſic; the firſt being an effect produced by the immediate oppoſition of different notes; whereas, in melody, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the preſent ſounds with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe that are paſt.</p>
                  <p>Colours are properly oppoſed to colours, and lines to lines; but we muſt not attempt to ſet in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the effect of objects which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to different ſenſes, neither is it neceſſary that there ſhould always be an immediate contraſt, ſince the mind, retaining former impreſſions, will aſſociate ſuch of them with the preſent as compoſes the melody moſt grateful to itſelf. For we can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no abſolute and ſingle beauty, without ſuppoſing a mind totally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all other ideas. If memory retain perceptions of other objects, it is impoſſible to preclude compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
                  <p>Counterpoint, in muſic, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companiment which contraſts the general effect of the melody, as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0857400100:40"/>
ſhade ſupports light in painting; not reſpecting any part ſingly, but ſuſtaining and heightening each particular melody in the relative effect and proportion it bears to the whole.</p>
                  <p>Uniformity is the contraſt to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and minuteneſs the relative meaſure of magnitude. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected ſharpneſſes of viſible objects, ſet off to advantage their protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant roundings; the former lead to an idea of non-entity, the latter to a notion of plenitude and exiſtence. Roundneſs, ſoftneſs, and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are pleaſing, but not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: it is the rough and the ſharp
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0857400100:41"/>
which give energy to compoſition; a general idea of beauty being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to an aſſemblage of every quality of matter, where the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſigns of materiality and of gentle feeling are ſtill ſet off by the obſcure foil of their reſpective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries or privations. An idea of light ariſes, as it were, out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Sound ſeems to originate from ſilence, and motion from reſt. Even matter itſelf ſeems to emerge from the empty abyſs of ſpace; imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all its conjunctions, like a ſkilful muſician, ſtill proceeding by the rule of contraries.</p>
                  <p>When any object, however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0857400100:42"/>
in its own nature, enters into compoſition, it then becomes a part of a greater whole, reſpecting which it muſt appear to hold a like relation as its own parts one to another; though even contraſt itſelf muſt be in a manner contraſted. Thus ſmall oppoſitions, uniting in effect, are formed into wholes, which, in their collective capacity, produce greater and more ſtriking oppoſitions.</p>

That particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar object is moſt agreeably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, which either affects the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by exciting the livelieſt percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or which, by means of what is delightful to ſenſe, expreſſes the cleareſt ſenſe of internal percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The ſame power by which the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0857400100:49"/>
nerves of the human body are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally agitated, affects their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and induces an alteration in the external form. The pleaſures of ſenſation are again reflected out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and again are perceived by the ſenſes, communicating a new and ſocial happineſs. It is not till goodneſs be thus expreſſed, that it aſſumes the nature of beauty.</p>
                  <p>All pleaſure, whether proceeding from ſimple or complex cauſes, may be diſtinguiſhed as follows: firſt, the pleaſure of perceiving the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of objects by means of ſenſe, <hi>by which</hi> we know that we exiſt; ſecondly, the ſocial ſatisfaction of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0857400100:50"/>
perceiving an expreſſion of this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in others, by which we know that they live or exiſt; thirdly, the pleaſure of perceiving the ſocial or communicative principle, and that this is mutually perceived in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, including all the former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to which they are to be conſidered only as aſſiſting and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient.</p>
                  <p>Some of our perceptions of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure proceed from powers original and innate; others are derived from experience and cuſtom, ſuch as that which renders things, diſagreeable in themſelves, pleaſing when we are accuſtomed to find them aſſociated
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0857400100:51"/>
with circumſtances and objects that are in themſelves agreeable. Many are the characters already eſtabliſhed by nature; and even artificial cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters derive a kind of propriety from cuſtom, which is rightly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecond nature. Is it the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the eye to be lucid, and of the cheek to be red? a bright eye, and a roſy cheek, are, of their kind, the moſt beautiful; each part being beautiful, either according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of gentle expreſſion it poſſeſſes in itſelf, or as it is habitually aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with parts that are more gently expreſſive. Yet, we may obſerve, that this very expreſſion depends,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0857400100:52"/>
for its effect, on being properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and contraſted, otherwiſe it could not properly be perceived.—One conſtituent of beauty, is colour; another, ſhape or proportion: but a variety of gaudy colours would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the effect of beautiful form. It is neceſſary, therefore, in order to produce an agreeable effect, that there be a union and ſubordination in the means of expreſſion, and that none of the leſs eſſential qualities confound the greater; as it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, in order to render any more complicated character or compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfect, that there be a chief or principal part, which is moſt ſtriking
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0857400100:53"/>
or expreſſive: the countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt remarkable part of the human body; as, in the countenance, the eye is the principal feature. Even one part of the ſame body owes its beauty to the affinity it bears to the reſt, as the beauty of the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on its oppoſition to other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The neck of a ſtatue, were it ever ſo well ſhaped, would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear beautiful when ſeparated from the head and ſhoulders; the ſeeming ſoftneſs and ſmoothneſs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom would ceaſe to pleaſe, did the head and ſhoulders ſeem to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoft and ſmooth. Complete cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or wholes, to render their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0857400100:54"/>
qualities ſtriking or perceptible, muſt likewiſe be properly contraſted. And it is as neceſſary that man be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from man, as man from other creatures: for this cauſe, in the compoſition of a truly beautiful human character, it is required, that there be a certain turn or ſingularity of form and of feature, as well as an air or expreſſion on the whole, to eſtabliſh an identity, difference, and ſuperiority, reſpecting all other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, to render it peculiarly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible and engaging.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IX. Of GRACEFULNESS.</head>
                  <p>IN ſpeaking of expreſſion, we muſt diſtinguiſh between an expreſſion of the benevolent kind, and of the iraſcible or malignant. Animals of coarſer natures are fully as ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of anger, hatred, revenge, or any of the hoſtile paſſions, as men; and the baſeſt of the human race are ever moſt ſubject to ſuch paſſions: but they know little of pity, love, eſteem, or any of the gentler ones. The malignant paſſions diſqualify the mind for every pleaſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ſenſation. Anger is the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0857400100:56"/>
painful or ſtupifying paſſion, as love is the delicious and enlivening one. It would therefore be highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to apply the idea of gracefulneſs to one in a fit of rage or jealouſy; what pleaſes moſt in appearance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently an expreſſion of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>He who ſeeks to know the origin of gracefulneſs, muſt look for it in his own mind; whatever is graceful there, muſt be ſo in expreſſion. It is a quality analogous to the moſt exquiſite tenderneſs of affection; that ſweet enthuſiaſm of action which goes hand in hand with beauty; or, if we may be allowed the phraſe, it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0857400100:57"/>
is the <hi>ſoul</hi> of beauty, or the <hi>emphaſis</hi> of pleaſing expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the tendereſt and moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful moments of thought, the body is naturally thrown into attitudes which have the power of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating a like ſoftneſs to the minds of others; it is on account of this pleaſing ſympathy, that we beſtow on ſuch actions or expreſſions the appellation of <hi>graceful.</hi>—Much has been ſaid about an appearance of eaſe peculiar to gracefulneſs; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will be impoſſible to find an example of any very graceful atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that conveys not ſome degree of carefulneſs or anxiety. The ſweet,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0857400100:58"/>
reluctant amorous delay, the hopes, fears, and tender ſolicitudes of love, preſent us with images of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gracefulneſs. Even in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that have an appearance of diſtreſs, beauty oft aſſumes an air of the ſublimeſt grace and dignity. There is indeed a certain elevation of mind, a happy conſciouſneſs of ſuperior virtue, requiſite to dignify every paſſion, and is eſſential to grace; for there is no grace without dignity. Grace is the ſublimity of beauty; the modeſt pride of virtue; the gentle dignity of love. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude expreſſive of the penſive and pleaſing melancholy, a ſentiment pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0857400100:59"/>
to the fineſt ſouls, is ever moſt graceful. The lovelieſt of the Graces has on her face a caſt of ſadneſs mixt with the ſweeteſt joy. Gracefulneſs is an expreſſion of pleaſure; but pleaſure is not eaſe, it is ſomething more. In truth, the mind is far from being moſt happy when moſt at eaſe; this being at beſt a negative kind of happineſs: in order to be really ſo, it muſt be employed in ſome purſuit wherein it is deeply concerned, and its affections fondly engaged: beſet on all ſides with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fear, we embrace with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every occaſion of hope, and become more intereſted and happy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0857400100:60"/>
in the purſuit and accompliſhment of our wiſhes, as the labour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more arduous of overtaking them.</p>
                  <p>Here we mean not to ſay, that graceful action may not be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found without its peculiar energy in the mind: we only advance, that our prejudices in favour of graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are originally founded on this principle; and would thence infer, that any appearance of beauty which is conſiſtent with perfect indolence or eaſe, can ſuggeſt nothing more than a prediſpoſition to elegance of action, a ſeeming aptitude in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſymptoms of affection. It is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0857400100:61"/>
not till the paſſions have arrived at maturity, and are ſweetened by the acceſſion of love, that the perſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a true air of delicate graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If one who has no elegance of ſoul appear graceful, it is by accident, as a fool ſometimes looks wiſe. In love, the ſoul is feelingly alive to every finer ſenſe, and it is the fineſt expreſſion of life which excites it; love perſonified being perfect beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>When we meet with a paſſage in any author that expreſſes a lively ſentiment of compaſſion, joy, grief, for even the ſorrow of ſenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is frequently accompanied with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0857400100:62"/>
pleaſure, there is always preſented to us along with it, an image of gracefulneſs. It is this delicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm which ſo conſpicuouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes the works of <hi>Raphaël</hi> and <hi>Correggio</hi>; it is this alone which raiſes above others the writings of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc <hi>Sappho.</hi> The great charm of poetry is that <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>muſe</hi> which inſpires every thing with elegance and <hi>animation.</hi> The beautiful and the graceful of ſentiment, are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the higheſt degree of <hi>life</hi> or <hi>human feeling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venus of Medicis</hi> is generally given as an example of female beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and indeed is probably the moſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0857400100:63"/>
graceful and perfect of all human productions; but this ſtatue is highly imitative of modeſty, that exquiſite grace and ornament of every amiable virtue. Were an artiſt to attempt a painting of the like kind, how might he ſtill heighten every grace by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing a ſweet bluſh over the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his figure; a circumſtance in which the marble is neceſſarily defective? And this is, no doubt, what is meant by that fine allegory of Venus attired by the Graces, that every thing which is graceful in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, is only as it were the trappings and ornaments of that heavenly love of the ſoul, by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0857400100:64"/>
aſcribed to the <hi>Venus Urania,</hi> or celeſtial; in oppoſition to what is attributed to the other <hi>Venus,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by them as the earthly and vulgar.</p>
                  <p>THUS have we briefly traced the progreſs of beauty from its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> to its ſecond ſource of perfection in the <hi>mind,</hi> both centring in the conſciouſneſs of <hi>life</hi> or <hi>ſenſibility:</hi> and as we have before obſerved, that whatever cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuggeſt the ſenſations ſimilar to the qualities we perceive in ourſelves, are the actual and principal pleaſures of the ſenſes; ſo it is ſtill more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0857400100:65"/>
our notice, that nothing gives us ſo much ſatisfaction, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the ſymptoms of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or happineſs in thoſe whoſe merit and beauty entitle them to a ſhare either in our love or eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It is at this ſecond period pleaſure loſes the name of ſenſual or ſelfiſh. He who poſſeſſes this more extenſive animation, is conſequently intereſted in the happineſs of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as alſo in the ſtudy of every thing that is related to this finer ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and, as he perceives beauty in theſe things, he will intereſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their perfection, looking on
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0857400100:66"/>
them as in ſome meaſure related to himſelf, and as portions of that univerſal and ſocial whole, of which he conſiders himſelf alſo as a part.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may conclude, that the reliſh mankind have for true beauty, is in proportion to the clearneſs of their moral perceptions; or, in other words, to their love of goodneſs: that even inanimate beauty is chiefly a ſecondary idea, or aſſociation, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the external ſymptoms of natural affection, which is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the human ſoul: and that not only whatever tends to deprive us of life, but whatever obſtructs the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0857400100:67"/>
exerciſe of the finer powers, whereon depends the conſciouſneſs of life, provokes <hi>ſorrow, fear,</hi> and <hi>horror</hi>; whatever has the contrary effect, promotes HOPE, LOVE, and JOY.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>THE pleaſures attending virtue, are, firſt, the immediate ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we enjoy in contributing to the happineſs of others, virtue in this caſe being its own beſt reward; not that it beſtows becauſe it receives, but that it receives becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows, as a luminous body is yet more enlightened by the reflection of its own ſplendor. Secondly, the pleaſure we receive from the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the world, or rather of that part of it whoſe applauſe we eſteem, the pleaſure proceeding from what is commonly called the love of fame.—Selfiſhneſs is that contracted ſenſe of pleaſure which excludes every idea of ſocial enjoyment. It is a mere abuſe of words to call that <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> which includes the happineſs of others;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0857400100:70"/>
ſince, in the ſtrict idea of a ſelf, there is but one included.</p>
                  <p>True happineſs flows from the firſt-mentioned principle, and is the enjoyment of pleaſure by reflection, the pleaſure of pleaſing thoſe we love, or the ſtill more extenſive pleaſure of contributing to the happineſs of all mankind. The firſt and ſecond of thoſe motives are indeed aſſiſting to each other; for what can be more pleaſing than ſelf-applauſe when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the approbation of the good? But thoſe who are actuated merely by the love of fame, are far more numerous than thoſe who firſt conſult the approbation of their own hearts, and who eſteem the applauſe of the many, not altogether for its own ſake, but as it accords with the voice of reaſon; while he whoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings teach him to diſtinguiſh between
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0857400100:71"/>
the good and the evil of moral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will alſo have a choice in the rectitude of external applauſe, always preferring the commendation of the few who beſtow it on real merit, to the voice of the vulgar, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by caprice or by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay to ſuch as place their ultimate contentment in ſelfiſhneſs and ſenſuality, whoſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy is ſo narrowly confined, that they enjoy no pleaſure from partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? or to thoſe that are ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, as to be deterred from actions hurtful to themſelves and to their fellow-creatures, by no other than the baſeſt of all motives, the dread of puniſhment? Were it poſſible to perſuade mankind, what is their chief intereſt here to know, that to aſſiſt the good endeavours, and to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0857400100:72"/>
with the weakneſſes and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of each other, yields an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment far ſuperior to any that is of a mere ſelfiſh nature, there would be little occaſion, in a moral view, to threaten the infliction either of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or eternal puniſhment. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ſeems almoſt ſufficiently juſt, if there be any totally deſtitute of humanity, that ſuch, from their dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are deprived of the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and exalted felicity.</p>
                  <p>Self-ſatisfaction, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is an object of purſuit in all; but ambition and avarice embrace the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, the means of good for good itſelf. The vainly-ambitious place their chief happineſs in fame, ignorant of what ſhould go before; the avaricious in fortune, equally blind to the bleſſings that ſhould follow. To employ every
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0857400100:73"/>
gentle method, therefore, of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this principle of human ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; to improve our moſt delicate feelings, and give to the ſoul a more tender touch of all that is endearing to humanity, by exerciſing it in the ſpeculation and practice of ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous virtue, is the great purpoſe of moral precept and of ſound philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>

                  <p>THE good qualities of the head and of the heart are rarely found together; their union compoſes a mind truly noble. The folly of ill-directed goodneſs too nearly reſembles vice; the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0857400100:76"/>
of the unfeeling is worſe than folly.</p>
                  <p>THE ſame principle which prompts a man to ſeek happineſs, or to relieve himſelf in diſtreſs, diſpoſes him to make others happy, or to alleviate their diſtreſſes. The leſs ſenſibility any man poſſeſſes, his affections are the more ſelfiſh; the more he is ſenſible of happineſs himſelf, he is the more diſpoſed to make others happy.</p>
                  <p>THAT peeviſh weakneſs and ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of nerve, which is apt to be alarmed at trifles, and to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without ſufficient cauſe, is to be claſſed with other diſtempers; it is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0857400100:77"/>
falſe or diſeaſed feeling. Some are rather irritable than ſenſible; their coarſer natures are capable only of the malevolent and groſſer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>A PREDISPOSITION to the coarſer paſſions can never proceed from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of ſentiment, but argues a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the very reverſe: true ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is ever inclined to overlook er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and to forgive injuries; altho', on ſome occaſions, reaſon teaches it to act with becoming dignity and ſpirit. Mens enjoyments or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes are to be computed from their different degrees of feeling. What can they mean who ſpeak of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0857400100:78"/>
the happineſs of the inſenſible? Can there be a greater abſurdity, than to envy the enjoyments of ſuch as want the power to enjoy?</p>

                  <p>AN original delicacy of taſte is alſo the inſeparable effect and ſymptom of the true ſenſibility; which includes not only a ſenſe of love, pity, gratitude, or common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for of thoſe even the rudeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſeldom altogether deſtitute; but it is a certain elegance of ſoul,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0857400100:79"/>
which renders kindneſs moſt kind, and pleaſure moſt pleaſing; it is genius and taſte, the tenderneſs of friendſhip, the politeneſs of eſteem, and the exquiſite and refined endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love!</p>
                  <p>TASTE is the younger ſiſter of Virtue; the offspring of Taſte is Pleaſure, that of Virtue is Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: it is the grace of ſentiment: that which pleaſes ſuch as are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of the higheſt pleaſure; a ſubordinate, yet more amiable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which depends on the nicer diſcernments of ſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>ON the clearneſs of moral percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſentimental light, depends
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0857400100:80"/>
the power of chooſing the good and refuſing the evil. Whatever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to improve the mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes this faculty of accepting and refuſing, by rendering the characters of good and evil more perſpicuous and diſtinct.</p>
                  <p>ALL ignorance of beauty, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of taſte, is defective anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all improvement and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe, is increaſed ſenſibility; the powers of the mind, as well as of the body, being rendered more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by a proper exerciſe of them.

To reſtore the criminal himſelf to a ſenſe of his duty, to ſet an example to others, or to rid ſociety of a deſperate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are the three rational ends for which puniſhment or death is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: otherwiſe retribution of evil is malevolence or blind revenge, and not juſtice.</p>
                  <p>THERE are certain exceptions to general laws, wherein juſtice aſſumes the name of mercy: he who, in his conduct, obſerves theſe exceptions, is juſtly merciful.</p>
                  <p>IT is owing to the imperfection of human laws, which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt all accidental circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0857400100:113"/>
and exceptions, that an idea of mercy is oppoſed to that of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: theſe virtues, however, are not really repugnant; where mercy is proper, it were unjuſt not to be merciful.</p>
                  <p>THERE is hardly any ſuch paſſion among the virtuous as hatred: the vicious hate the enemies of vice; the good pity the enemies of virtue. A generous mind wiſhes not to find men faultleſs, but is happy in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions of forgiving their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
                  <p>THE violent and hoſtile paſſions are never employed by the wiſe, but

for the greater purpoſes of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>TO withhold our power, when we can prevent the ruin of a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creature, even againſt his will, is to be guilty of his deſtruction. Where is the difference in effect, whether evils are brought on us by our follies, or by fate? Is a man the leſs to be pitied who falls, for that his weakneſs was the cauſe of his falling?</p>
                  <p>WHO, if he ſaw a child approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brink of a precipice, would withhold his aſſiſtance, on a pretence that the child was left to the freedom of its own will? Men are like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0857400100:115"/>
that ſometimes muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from the ways of error.</p>
                  <p>THUS it has been inſtanced, thro' the whole of this performance, that <hi>ſenſibility,</hi> as directed by <hi>reaſon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes VIRTUE.</p>
