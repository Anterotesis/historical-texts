            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOW God himſelf connected religion, and the civil welfare of nations, in his ancient laws, almoſt the whole of the Old Teſtament doth bear witneſs. That religion is the great baſis of civil happineſs, was the common, the avowed belief of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſenſible Heathen: It was, for ought I know, the infamous monſter Tiberius, who firſt pretended, <hi>That the Gods alone ought to regard or reſent the injuries done them.</hi> Before the happy Reformation, the Popiſh clergy had reduced civil rulers into mere tools for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their pleaſure in religious matters; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that they <hi>had no power of judging</hi> in them. To free theſe rulers from ſuch Antichriſtian claims, the Proteſtant reformers, every where, as their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith and other writings make evident, loudly maintained, That to magiſtrates themſelves indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of clergymen, belongs a diſtinguiſhed power in the <hi>reformation</hi> and <hi>preſervation</hi> of religion. Not long after, Eraſtus, a German phyſician and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to curry favour with their reſpective princes, pretended, That magiſtrates are the proper lords of the Chriſtian church, from whom her miniſters and other rulers derive their whole power, and to whom they muſt be accountable. This notion, exceedingly flattering their ambition, was too greedily embraced by moſt of the Proteſtant princes; nor do I know of one Proteſtant church, which hath not ſuffered by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1285200500:4"/>
means of it. Meanwhile, the German Anabaptiſts, having experienced the frowns, and ſometimes the improper ſeverities of magiſtrates, copied after the ancient Donatiſts in the like circumſtances, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contended, That magiſtrates have no more power about religious matters than any private perſon, and ought to puniſh none for different ſentiments in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or forms of worſhip. The Socinians and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant Arminians, except when magiſtrates favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and promoted their cauſe, zealouſly contended for the ſame notion, at leaſt in the caſe of miniſters and worſhip, which were not maintained at the public expence. Many, if not moſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Independents in the laſt century were much of the ſame mind; and hence, by their influence, ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain a ratification by the Engliſh Parliament, or a place in their own <hi>Savoy Confeſſion.</hi> Part of theſe paſſages, relative to the magiſtrate's power, are alſo dropt from the Confeſſion of Faith agreed to by the Independents of New England in 1682. Moſt of the Engliſh Diſſenters of this century ſeem to be much of the ſame mind; eſpecially ſuch as might otherwiſe have been expoſed to danger on account of their open maintenance of Arian, Socinian, and Quakeriſh blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies—Locke and biſhop Hoadly, and ſome others of the Epiſcopalian party, warmly eſpouſed the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>This notion never received much countenance in Scotland, till Mr Glaſs of Tealing commenced a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious new-faſhioned Independent. He mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, That the Jewiſh nation was an eccleſiaſtical one, and their kings eccleſiaſtical rulers; that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian magiſtrates have no more power in religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than private Chriſtians, and ought not to employ their power in advancing the true religion, or in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws with penalties in favour of it; or in reſtraining or puniſhing heretics or falſe teachers, nor ought they to give more encouragement to good Chriſtians, than to other peaceable ſubjects;—that the example of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming kings of Judah in puniſhing idolatry and falſe worſhip, and in promoting the true religion, is not now to be imitated; and that our fathers national
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1285200500:5"/>
covenanting againſt Popery and other wickedneſs, in favour of the true religion was <hi>unwarrantable,</hi> and is <hi>not binding</hi> upon us.—<hi>Dr. Wiſheart, Principal of the college of Edinburgh,</hi> in his ſermons contended, That magiſtrates have only a right to puniſh ſuch crimes as ſtrike immediately againſt the perſons or property of men; but not to puniſh any thing which ſtrikes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt the honour of God, as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or hereſy; that all men ought to have civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to think and ſpeak as they pleaſe, providing they make no attack upon the welfare of civil ſociety; that none ought to be hampered in their ſearch after truth by any requirement of their ſubſcriptions to <hi>Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> or <hi>Confeſſions of Faith;</hi> that children in their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ought never to be biaſſed to a ſide by learning catechiſms which maintain the peculiar principles of a party. Theſe or the like notions have been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by not a few of the pretenders to modern illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>In her <hi>public Standards,</hi> the Church of Scotland hath renounced, and in her ſolemn covenants hath abjured both theſe extremes. In her <hi>Old Confeſſion of Faitb,</hi> which is expreſly ſworn to in the national cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of 1581, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>in all points the undoubted truth of God,</hi> Art. xxiv, ſhe aſſerts, that <q rend="inline">"the power and authority of magiſtrates is God's <hi>holy ordinance,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for manifeſtation of his own glory, and for the ſingular profit of mankind—they are the <hi>lieutenants of God,</hi> in whoſe ſeſſions God himſelf doth fit and judge—to whom by God is given the ſword to the praiſe and defence of good men, and to puniſh all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen malefactors. To kings, princes, rulers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates chiefly, and moſt principally, the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purgation of religion appertains; ſo that not only are they appointed for civil policy, but alſo for maintenance of the true religion, and for ſuppreſſion of all idolatry and ſuperſtition whatſoever."</q> This doctrine is further aſſerted and explained in her ſecond book of diſcipline, chap. ix; The doctrine of her <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> the WHOLE of which is ſolemnly eſpouſed and engaged to, by every Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian miniſter and elder in Scotland in his ordination vows, is that <q rend="inline">"for their publiſhing opinions or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

                  </gap>ate," Chap. xx. 4.—</q>that <q rend="inline">"God, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and King of all the world, hath ordained civil magiſtrates to be under him, over the people, for his own glory and the public good—they ought eſpecially, (in managing their office) to maintain PI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY, juſtice and peace, according to the <hi>wholeſome</hi> laws of each commonwealth—That the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate—HATH authority, and it IS his duty to take order that unity and peace be preſerved in the church, and that the truth of God be kept pure and entire; that all blaſphemies and hereſies be ſuppreſſed, all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and abuſes in worſhip and diſcipline prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reformed, and all the ordinances of God du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled, adminiſtered and obſerved. For the better effecting of which, he hath power to call Synods, to be preſent at them, and to provide that whatſoever is tranſacted in them be according to the mind of God," Chap. xxiii. 1, 2, 3.—</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"The duties required in the ſecond commandment are—the diſapproving, deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, oppoſing all falſe worſhip, and according to each one's place and calling, removing it, and all monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of idolatry;—The ſins forbidden in the ſecond commandment are, all deviſing, counſelling, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, uſing, and any ways approving any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip not inſtituted by God himſelf, tolerating a falſe religion." Lar. Cat. Q 108, 109.</q> Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations are an authentic explication of the power of the magiſtrate in <hi>maintaining and preſerving the true religion,</hi> the defence of which is expreſly ſworn in their ſolemn covenants with God. If therefore, Sir, you diſcredit this doctrine, and plead the toleration of idolatry, blaſphemy, hereſy, and that magiſtrates ought to meddle with nothing in religion, be ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as openly to renounce your ordination vows and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1285200500:7"/>
the Confeſſion of Faith and Catechiſms, as well as the national Covenant and Solemn League.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate the above doctrine of our excellent ſtandards, it is proper to obſerve, (1.) God alone is the neceſſarily exiſtent, and abſolutely independent Creator and preſerver, and therefore original and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme proprietor and governor of all things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth, Exod. iii. 4. Gen. i. Pſal. civ. and xxiv. 1, 2. xxxiii. 6. lxxxiii. 18. xlvii. 2, 7, 9. Ezek. i. 11. Col. i. 16,—18. Dan. iv. 34, 35. (2.) All right, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, natural, or ſpiritual, whether of conſcience, or of perſons, or of huſbands, parents, maſters, magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, miniſters, or even of Chriſt as mediator, muſt therefore wholly originate from God alone, Pſalm cxv. 16. Rom. ii. 36. Heb. ii. 10 Acts x. 25, 28. 2 Cor. v. 18. Pſal. lxxv. 7. Dan. ii. 21. iv. 32, 35. Mat. xxviii. 18. ii. 27. John v. 35. To ſuppoſe any real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>right or being whatſoever, unoriginating from him, is to give up with the neceſſary exiſtence of God, and to plunge into the very <hi>depths of Atheiſm.</hi> (3.) All right and authority of conſcience, perſons, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, parents, magiſtrates, miniſters, or even of Chriſt as mediator, being wholly derived from God, ought, neceſſarily ought, wholly to be improved, or exerciſed in his name, in conformity and ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his law, as the ſupreme rule, and in order to promote his declarative glory as the chief end of it. Prov. xvi. 4 Rom ii. 30. 1 Pet. iv. 11. 1 Cor x. 31. John v. 30. viii. 29 vii. 18. Eph iii. 21 (4.) No right or authority derived from God can therefore be lawfully improven or exerciſed, in protecting, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, allowing or commanding any thing which God himſelf, on account of his infinite perfection in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtice, goodneſs and truth, cannot command;—or in diſcouraging, diſallowing, or prohibiting any thing which God in his law requires. It is abſurd to ſuppoſe it, that God can give men a power which he hath not himſelf; and ſhocking blaſphemy to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him capable of giving men a right and authority to contemn or counteract his own law as their rule, or his own glory as their chief end, in every thing they do, 2 Tim. ii. 13. Hab. i. 12, 13. Exod, xv. 11. Deut. xxxii. 4. Zeph. iii. 5. James i. 13. (5.) All the diverſified forms of right and authority in conſcience,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1285200500:8"/>
huſbands, parents, maſters, magiſtrates, miniſters, and even in Chriſt as mediator, being derived from the <hi>ſame God of infinite wiſdom and order,</hi> each of them may, and ought to be wholly exerciſed within its proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and in a manner anſwerable to its nature, and never in the way of invading the place or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the exerciſe of any other right or authority. No right of conſcience can be exerciſed to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the due exerciſe of marital, parental, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial, magiſtratical, miniſterial, or Chriſt's media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial authority; nor, can any regular exerciſe of theſe powers interrupt the due exerciſe of the power of conſcience, or of one another, 1 Cor. xiv. 33, 40. vii. 20, 24. (6.) All theſe different forms of power and authority being derived from the <hi>ſame God,</hi> may have the ſame things for their object, but viewed in different reſpects. The ſame man may be ſubject to the power of his conſcience as he is a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,—ſubject to the power of parents as a child,—ſubject to the power of maſters as a ſervant,—ſubject to the power of magiſtrates as a member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,—ſubject to the power of church-rulers as a member of an organized viſible church,—ſubject to the mediatorial power of Chriſt, as a member of his myſtical body, or an agent for promoting the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it.—The ſame good work of piety or virtue may, or ought to be required by conſcience, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, maſters, magiſtrates, miniſters, and even by Chriſt as mediator, in different reſpects, as calculated to promote the welfare of the perſons, families, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and churches concerned,—in ſubordination to the glory of God as their reſpective proprietor and ſuperior. The performance of the ſame good work may be encouraged by rewards from all theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent powers, anſwerable to their reſpective forms.—The ſame vices of idolatry, blaſphemy, calumny, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, theft, murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in different reſpects hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perſons, families, civil ſocieties, and churches, may, and ought to be prohibited by all theſe different powers, and reſented by each, as hurtful to itſelf, as ſubordinated to God,—in a manner anſwerable to its particular nature and department,—by conſcience with ſtinging rebukes,—by parents with correction, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1285200500:9"/>
or the like,—by maſters with frowns, ſtripes, abridgment of wages, or the like,—by magiſtrates with public diſhonour, fining, impriſonment, or death,—by church rulers with eccleſiaſtical rebuke, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,—by Chriſt with temporal, ſpiritual or eternal judgment, Acts xxiv. 16. Joſh xxiv. 15. Pſal. ci. Mat. v, vi, vii, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (7.) All theſe powers of conſcience, huſbands, parents, maſters, magiſtrates, church-rulers, and of Chriſt as mediator, proceeding from an infinitely wiſe, powerful and good God, are each of them, in its own place, altogether ſufficient to gain its own end.—Nevertheleſs, it mightily tends to the advantage of each, that all of them be rightly exerciſed at once, and to the hurt oſ all the reſt, if any of them be not. If conſcience act faithfully, this promotes the regular and comfortable exerciſe of the power of huſbands, parents, maſters, magiſtrates or miniſters. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is to the advantage of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if they regularly exerciſe their power, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if Chriſt exerciſe his, in a remarkable manner. It is much to the advantage of Church and State, if huſbands, parents, and maſters, faithfully exerciſe their power in their reſpective departments; and much to their hurt, if they do not. If the rulers in Church and State, faithfully diſcharge their truſt, it will tend much to promote the welfare of families. The more faithfully miniſters labour in winning ſouls to Chriſt, and teaching men to live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and godly in view of Chriſt's ſecond coming, the more eaſy will the work of magiſtrates, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the happineſs of the commonwealth be.—The more faithfully magiſtrates act in curbing of crimes, and promoting obedience to God the King of nations, as a mean of ſecuring his felicitating bleſſing to the commonwealth, the more delightfully will church-power be exerciſed, and the more abundantly it will tend to the welfare of the church. Nay, though the mediatorial power of Chriſt be infinitely ſufficient in its own place, to anſwer its own ends, yet the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exerciſe and ſucceſs of it is not a little promoted by the faithful exerciſe of the powers of conſcience, huſbands, parents, maſters, magiſtrates and church-rulers, Acts xxiv. 16. 1 Tim. i. 5. Eph. iv,—vi. Col.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1285200500:10"/>
iii. iv. 1 &amp; 2 Tim. Titus i.—iii. 1 Pet. ii.—v. Pſalm ii. 10, 12. Rev. ii. 15. xvii. 14, 16. xxi. 24. Iſa. xlix. 23. lx, 3, 4, 10, 16. (8.) Though the marital, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental, magiſterial, magiſtratical, and miniſterial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be altogether diſtinct from, and independent of one another, and each of them have its own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar exerciſes pertaining to it alone;—yet the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in reſpect of different relations, may be at once ſuperior or inferior to another perſon,—and ſo may be required to fulfil the particular duties of his ſtation, by one who hath not any lawful right to perform them himſelf. Thus magiſtrates and miniſters as ſuch, may require huſbands to perform their duties to their wives, parents to perform theirs to their children, or maſters theirs to their ſervants, as a mean of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the welfare of the commonwealth and of the church, in obedience to God, and aiming at his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. An uncrowned huſband of a queen may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her, faithfully to exerciſe her magiſtratical power, as a means of honour and happineſs to his family; and ſhe as queen may command him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing relating to the welfare of the ſtate, as her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer or ſubject. A parent may require his ſon, as ſuch, faithfully to exerciſe his miniſterial, magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or magiſterial power as a mean of honour and happineſs to his family. A ſon may command his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is his ſervant, in every thing pertaining to the ſervice due from him, and even to order his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aright, in ſo far as it tends to promote that ſervice. Miniſters, as the ambaſſadors of Chriſt, have power to require magiſtrates, <hi>as church members,</hi> faithfully to exerciſe their magiſtratical power, ſo as may beſt promote the honour of Chriſt, and the welfare of his church. And on the other hand, magiſtrates have power to require miniſters <hi>as their ſubjects,</hi> faithfully to exerciſe their miniſterial power, as a mean of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the nation pious and virtuous, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its happineſs,—and all this in ſubordination to the law, and to promote the glory of God as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme governor of families, churches, or nations. (9.) Though the marital, parental, magiſterial, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical and miniſterial powers, have, each of them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1285200500:11"/>
ſomething for its peculiar and diſtinguiſhing object, in which no other power can interfere with it;—Thus it is always unlawful for huſbands, parents, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or miniſters, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to aſſume the power of civil magiſtrates in levying taxes, adjudging criminals to death,—always unlawful for parents, maſters, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to preach the goſpel, diſpenſe ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or church-cenſures;—yet if the exerciſe of ſome of theſe powers be fearfully neglected or abuſed, the other powers may be exerciſed, in order to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the diſorders occaſioned, further than would be proper if there were no ſuch neglect, abuſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Thus if huſbands, parents, or maſters, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſe their power, relative to wives, children, or ſervants, the rulers of church or ſtate, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of theſe ſocieties, may interfere more with their family-concerns, than would be proper in other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. If church-rulers be notoriouſly negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or wicked, magiſtrates <hi>as church-members,</hi> and to <hi>promote the welfare of the ſtate,</hi> may do more in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the church, than would be proper for them, if church rulers were diligent and faithful. And, if through the indolence or wickedneſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, the affairs of the nation be thrown into terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſion, miniſters <hi>as members of the commonwealth, and to promote the welfare of the church,</hi> may do more in the rectification of affairs, than would be proper, if the magiſtrates were faithful, 2 Kings xi. 2 Chron. xxiii (10.) All governing authority empowers the poſſeſſors of it, to iſſue forth laws or commandments, binding on the ſubject of it. But theſe laws or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments can extend their binding force no further, than the particular department belonging to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as by that, every particular form of authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God, is limited. The laws or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of parents, maſters, magiſtrates, and church-rulers, extend only to external things in the family, commonwealth, or church. Theſe of conſcience and of Chriſt extend alſo to that which is inward in the heart.—And as all human ſuperiors are imperfect in knowledge themſelves, and cannot enable their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects perfectly to underſtand their whole duty, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that laws of families or nations, or conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1285200500:12"/>
of churches require <hi>nothing but what is plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the law of God,</hi> and nothing in religion but what is <hi>plainly required by the word of God,</hi> that ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be contrary to theſe laws but what is not only <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>plainly</hi> contrary to the word of God. And, the weaker the ſubjects are, the more conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion ought to be exerciſed towards them in this matter, Rom. xv, 1, 2. (11.) As men cannot bow the hearts of their inferiors unto ſubjection, they ought always to iſſue forth their commandments in the moſt prudent, mild and gaining manner. It is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to iſſue forth any law doubtful or obſcure, or which moſt of the ſubjects are not likely to be got peaceably to comply with. This ought eſpecially to be attended to, in the framing and impoſing of <hi>laws and conſtitutions relative to religion,</hi> which ought to be a <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> ſervice. (12) As noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, particularly in religion, ought to be contrary to any law of church or ſtate but what is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of God; and nothing ought to be held <hi>cenſurable</hi> by the laws of the church, or <hi>puniſhable</hi> by the laws of the ſtate, but what is <hi>plainly contrary</hi> to theſe laws, and hath become <hi>duly public,</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, without requiring the party concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his own accuſer.—So, on account of the weakneſs or number of the offenders, or the diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate of the ſociety, <hi>many real ſcandals</hi> in the church muſt be forborne without centure, and <hi>many real crimes</hi> againſt the ſtate forborne without puniſhment; notwithſtanding, it would be extremely wicked, <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively</hi> to licenſe or tolerate them in either. If your children be very young, raving in a fever, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or apt to fall into convulſive fits, it might be very prudent and dutiful for you to forbear ſevere chaſtiſement of them for playing on the Lord's day; repeating ſome wicked expreſſions, they had heard from their fellow children, or the like. But would it be lawful in you to give them a parental licence to profane the Sabbath or name of God, and promiſe them protection in ſo doing? You dare not pretend it. God himſelf wiſely forbears the puniſhment of many things, which his law forbids. (13.) As it is never errors or corruptions <hi>of the heart,</hi> but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1285200500:13"/>
words and deeds, ſufficiently and regularly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, which are to be corrected in families, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in commonwealths, or cenſured in churches, Deut. xiii. 1,—14. xvii. 46. Heb. x. 28. 1 Tim. v. 1—So even in puniſhing manifeſt crimes, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, all proper mildneſs ought to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, never proceeding to extremities, where there is any hope of reformation, or where, as in the caſe of hereſy or blaſphemy, confeſſion and repentance can make any kind of reſtitution, Mat. xviii. 15,—18. Among the Hebrews, not one appears to have been puniſhed for idolatry, if he profeſſed repentance and reformation. The princes of Iſrael firſt attempted to bring the Reubenites and Gadites, whom they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed guilty of it, to repentance, Joſh. xxii. Never in the reformation by Aſa, Hezekiah, or Jofiah, have we one inſtance of a penitent idolater ſlain. The idolaters condemned to death, Deut. xiii. xvii. are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as <hi>men of Belial,</hi> preſumptuous, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their wickedneſs. The prophets of Baal whom Elijah cauſed be put to death, 1 Kings xviii. 40. and Mattan the prieſt, who was ſlain by Jehoiada's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, 2 Kings xi. 18. were no doubt of this ſort; and probably alſo guilty of promoting the murder of the Lord's prophets and people. The man put to death for profanation of the Sabbath, appears to have acted preſumptuouſly, Num. xv. 30,—36. Aſa and his ſubjects covenanted to put to death ſuch as obſtinately adhered to idolatry, 2 Chron. xv. 12, 13. (14.) Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ought never to attempt <hi>forcing</hi> men to believe with their hearts, even the moſt fundamental truths of religion, or to practiſe any religious duty,—that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no means appointed by God for convincing them of the truth, or inducing them to a cordial perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of religious duties, 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. But it would be highly abſurd, hence to infer, That magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates <hi>may not reſtrain</hi> men from robbing nations or churches of thoſe divine truths, which God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly entruſted to them, and which are inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly profitable to them,—or <hi>reſtrain</hi> them from propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating groſs hereſies, blaſphemies, idolatries, which undermine and exclude the true religion, provoke God o deſtroy nations, and are the fruitful ſeeds of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1285200500:14"/>
contention, confuſion, and every evil work. No ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate can compel me to love my neighbour as my ſelf, or can juſtly compel me to divide mine inheritance with him; but he may lawfully puniſh me for calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating or robbing him.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, extremely uncandid in the advocates for magiſtratical tolerations of hereſy, blaſphemy, and idolatry, always to attempt blending or placing on an equal level, <hi>true</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> religion,—<hi>mere neglect</hi> of ſome poſitive duties of religion, and <hi>ſhocking inſults</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the duties of religion,—<hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>ſecret miſtakes</hi> in religion, and the <hi>moſt damnable</hi> hereſies, blaſphemies, and idolatries, openly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately profeſſed and practiſed, as if theſe were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually objects of toleration, reſtraint, or puniſhment,—or, to confound a <hi>mere forbearance</hi> to puniſh, with an <hi>authoritative licence,</hi> openly to proſeſs and practiſe what is criminal reſpecting religion. The true religion ought never to need a toleration. It ought always to have an eſtabliſhment. Whereas a falſe one ought never to be eſtabliſhed, magiſtrates having no power againſt the truth but for the truth. There are <hi>many mere neglects</hi> or <hi>leſſer miſtakes</hi> in religion, againſt which it would not be proper for magiſtrates to enact civil laws, in this preſent ſtate of imperfection. And, if there be no civil law againſt them, they cannot be puniſhable as crimes. <q rend="inline">"Where no law is, there can be no tranſgreſſion."</q>—Mere forbearance to puniſh, what is plainly contrary to law, is, in ſome caſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and in imitation of God himſelf; and gives no poſitive encouragement to wickedneſs. Whereas a <hi>poſitive</hi> or <hi>authoritative</hi> toleration, proclaims to men, a liberty to ſin, and promiſeth them protection in ſo doing. If the provider for an army deliver to them fine flour mixed with ſome particles of bran, and a large quantity of arſenic, Is his delivery of the ſine flour, or even of the mixture of bran, as criminal and puniſhable, as that of the mixture of arſenic? No man that is not mad will pretend it. For the fine flour he deſerves the higheſt <hi>encouragement:</hi> for the bran he may be juſtiy <hi>forborne;</hi> but for the arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic he deſerves to be <hi>hanged.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1285200500:15"/>
The toleration, which I mean to oppoſe, if plainly and candidly expreſſed, would run thus: <q rend="inline">"We, the King and Parliament of —, as <hi>powers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God,—miniſters of God for good</hi> to men,—as the <hi>ordinance of God</hi> for the <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>puniſhment of evil doers,</hi> and the <hi>praiſe of them that do well,</hi>—as <hi>nurſing fathers</hi> to the church of Chriſt,—in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all our ſubjects may <hi>come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> and <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi>—Do hereby, in the <hi>name and authority</hi> of The Moſt High GOD, from whom we have derived all that governing power, which we poſſeſs, that we, <hi>ruling in his fear,</hi> may exerciſe it wholly in obedience to his law, and to promote his declarative glory in the world—Grant to all and every one of you, our ſaid ſubjects, an <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive toleration</hi> or legal licence,—openly and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to pervert, contradict, and revile the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God contained in his word,—and in the moſt in ſolent and abuſive manner to blaſpheme his nature, perfections, purpoſes and works, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the redemption of mankind,—and to corrupt his worſhip, repreſent him in it, in the moſt abſurd and abominable forms,—or rob him of it, giving it to devils, monſters of wickedneſs, brutes, ſtocks, or ſtones, in his ſtead,—and with all your might to exert yourſelves, in making your fellow ſubjects do the like.—And, we hereby do, In <hi>the ſame name and authority</hi> of God, the King of nations, promiſe you every kind and degree of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil protection in all ſuch behaviour, as you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, or pretend, your conſciences do dictate or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,—providing always, that you commit your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage only againſt God, your, and our Maker and Sovereign,—but do not diſturb the external peace of the nation, in reviling the civil character, ſeizing or hurting the civil property, or any way abuſing the body of any of your fellow ſinners of mankind."</q> —The correſpondent warrant of conſcience which we mean to impugn, if honeſtly expreſſed, would run thus: <q rend="inline">"I Conſcience, as the <hi>great deputy</hi> of The Moſt High GOD, Lord, and Lawgiver of the world, implanted in every man's breaſt, for

            <p n="1">I. Mens pleadings for it do, all of them, neceſſarily proceed on their adopting ſuch <hi>atheiſtical principles</hi> as the following, (1.) Mens natural or civil rights to their property, liberty, profits and honours, are not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally derived from God,—and ought to protect them in their moſt outragious ſinning againſt him (2,) Mens conſciences have a right and authority, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from, and independent of God, by which it can warrant them to think and ſpeak of, or act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, as inſolently and blaſphemouſly as they pleaſe. (3.) That, if the law of God, be any rule to men; it is not ſo, in reſpect of any intrinſic meaning affixed to it by him, but merely as it is underſtood by every man, particularly in that which relates to their behaviour towards God. (4.) All men being ready to miſtake, we ought always to believe that our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1285200500:17"/>
may have as juſt a view of the ſcriptures as ourſelves, and never to condemn them for that which they do not own to be blaſphemy, idolatry, or hereſy. (5.) Magiſtrates right and authority to govern others, doth not originate in God as the Creator, Preſerver, and King of nations, but in magiſtrates themſelves, <hi>or in their ſubjects;</hi> and ſo may be exerciſed as they pleaſe, particularly in requiring or allowing their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to belie, blaſpheme, or rob God. (6) Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates may be moral governors deputies or lieutenants, under God, without having any power or authority relating to religion, or his honour. (7.) Not the law of God natural or revealed, but the laws of nations ought to be the <hi>ſupreme</hi> ſtandard of all civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (8.) Not the declarative glory of God, as the Moſt High over all the earth, but the civil peace and proſperity of nations, ought to be the <hi>chief end</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in all their acts of government. (9) Mens natural rights of conſcience, or their civil rights, or the authority of magiſtrates, may or ought to empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, warrant, or protect them in groſs hereſy, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, idolatry, or other outragious abuſe and injury of God; but can by no means warrant or protect them in calumny, theft, murder, or any other injuries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men. (10.) There is no real difference between moral good and evil, at leaſt in things pertaining to God; and ſo true and falſe religion are equally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to promote the welfare of civil ſociety, and the virtues which render men good, peaceable, uſeful, and honourable rulers or ſubjects,—and hence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, blaſphemers, and idolaters may be <hi>good ſubjects.</hi> (11.) The favour or indignation of God is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to civil ſociety; and therefore magiſtrates ought to uſe no means to procure his favour by the encouragement of true religion, or to avert his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the reſtraint of groſs hereſy, blaſphemy, or idolatry,—but only labour to procure the friendſhip of men, and prevent their injuring the character, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or bodies of their ſubjects—That all theſe propoſitions are <hi>really atheiſtical,</hi> is manifeſt. They all give up with the neceſſary exiſtence, infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and abſolute ſupremacy of God, without any of which, he cannot be God at all.—That Locke,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1285200500:18"/>
Hoadly, Blackburn, Voltaire, and others, advocates for <hi>authoritative toleration</hi> of falſe religion, found their pleadings on the above propoſitions, is no leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to every judicious and unbiaſſed obſerver.—Nay, did not modeſty forbid, I might defy all the world to plead for <hi>ſuch toleration,</hi> without taking all, or ſome of the above or like atheiſtical propoſitions for granted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſcriptures plainly repreſent magiſtrates granting of men an unreſtrained freedom to profeſs and practiſe a falſe religion as extremely ſinful and hurtful. (1.) It is in the name of God to give a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the fleſh,</hi> of which <hi>hereſics</hi> and <hi>idolatry</hi> are the manifeſt and damning works, Gal. v. 13, 19,—21. with Rom. viii, 7, 8. (2.) It is not merely to <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>ſpare,</hi> but to <hi>encourage</hi> ſuch as ſeek to draw away their ſubjects from God, contrary to Deut. xiii. 9, 10. Eph. xiv. 14. 2 Tim. iii. 4, 5, 13. 2 Pet. ii. 1, 2, 3. (3.) In ſo doing, magiſtrates, as political ſhepherds, not only ſuffer the flock of God, the King of nations, under their charge, to <hi>wander</hi> or be <hi>driven</hi> from their fold and paſture, but encourage them in it,—contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Ezek. xxxiv. 5,—8. Acts xx 30. (4.) It marks a heavy judgment of God upon, and an anarchy in a commonwealth, when every man is left without reſtraint, and doth that which is right in his own eyes, in matters of religion, Judges xvii. 6. Zech. xi. 9, 16. 2 Chron. xx. 33. Amos iv. 4, 5. (5.) In granting <hi>ſuch liberty,</hi> magiſtrates are not for Chriſt, by whom they rule, Prov. viii. 15, 16. but againſt him, in encouraging and protecting the doctrines and works of the devil, which he came to deſtroy, John viii. 44. 1 Tim. iv. 2. Rev. xvi. 13, 14 with 1 John iii. 8. Zech. xiii. 2. (6) Falſe religion eats out the true doctrine of Chriſt, and the true piety and virtue which proceed from the faith of it,—which are like joints and bands to connect and eſtabliſh a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iſa. liii. 5. 2 Tim. ii. 16, 17. Gal. v. 10, 11, 12. (7.) Hereſies produce <hi>diviſions,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 18, 19. make men <hi>wanton, filthy dreamers, deſpiſers</hi> and <hi>revilers</hi> of magiſtrates, Jude, ver. 4, 8. 2 Pet. ii. 10,—17. they render times <hi>perilous,</hi> and make men <hi>traitors, heady,</hi>

Falſe religion deprives a nation of God's protecting hedge of favourable providence, and opens an inlet or the floods of deſtructive judgments, Exod. xxxii. 25. Ezek. xiii. 4, 5. and xxii. 30, 31. (9.) Magiſtrates indulgence of a falſe religion is repreſented as <hi>a kicking</hi> at the true religion, and <hi>an honouring</hi> of the corrupters <hi>above God,</hi> and brings a charge of the wickedneſs upon the tolerators of it.

Eph. v. 7, 11. and Nehemiah contended with the rulers of Judah for ſuffering the worſhip of God to be neglected, and the Sabbath profaned, Neh. xiii. 10,—18. (10) Such indulgence of falſe or corrupt religion is repreſented as tending to make men abhor the true religion, and ſpeak evil of it, 1 Sam. ii. 17. 2 Pet. ii. 1,—3.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The ſcriptures repreſent magiſtrates as having power to make civil laws relative to the external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of religion ſubordinated to the law of God, and anſwerable to their own department. (1.) They have in charge the keeping of the whole law of God, Deut. xvii. 19 1 Kings ii. 3. Joſh. i. 7, 8. 2 Chron xxiii. 11. Job xxix. 25. Rom. xiii. 1,—4. It is never hinted, that they have no charge with reſpect to religion, but the contrary. God choſe Moſes the magiſtrate, not Aaron the High-prieſt to publiſh his laws relative to religion.—Abijah avers, that in maintaining the true worſhip of God, he had kept the charge of the Lord, which Jeroboam the introducer of a falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had not, 2 Chron xiii. 10, 11. (2.) God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Jews good magiſtrates, in order to root out abuſive practices and monuments of falſe religion, Iſa i. 25, 26. Now, if they had power to root theſe out, they had certainly power to make laws for that effect. (3.) They ought to repeal wicked and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1285200500:20"/>
laws, and free their ſubjects from being bound over to puniſhment by them for their faithful ſervice of God, Pſalm xciv. 20. Iſa. x. 11. Mic. vi. 16. Hoſ. v. 11. If they can repeal wicked laws, they muſt have power to eſtabliſh what is contrary to them, Dan. iii. and vi. (4) If magiſtrates can make laws encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the true religion and church of Chriſt, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation of civil favours to the profeſſion or practice of goſpel-truth; they can alſo by law annex civil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the contempt of, or rebellion againſt theſe laws; they being for the <hi>terror and puniſhment of evil doers,</hi> as well as for the <hi>praiſe of them that do well,</hi> Rom. xiii. 3, 4. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14 Dan. vi. 16. iii. 29. Ezra i. 1,—5. vi. 3,—12. vii. 23,—27. (5) By enacting ſuch laws they neither invade the office of eccleſiaſtical rulers, who have no power to connect civil rewards or puniſhments, with any thing religious,—nor do they tranſgreſs any law of God.—What then can hinder their having power to make them? (6.) If all ſorts of men, church members and officers, as well as others, be ſubject to civil magiſtrates, they muſt have power, and ought to make civil laws calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to promote their advantage, in all theſe ſtations, Rom. xiii. 1,—4. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. 1 Tim. ii 1, 2. (7.) Unleſs magiſtrates have a power to make good laws relative to the external profeſſion and practice of religion, clergymen, if generally corrupt, will have it in their power, by Synodical conſtitutions, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to devour and poiſon their ſubjects, with the ſeeds of confuſion, profaneneſs, and every evil work, without any poſſibility of any legal reſtraint. For to allow magiſtrates to act without law, is to introduce tyranny and arbitrary government.</p>
            <p>But, in magiſtrates making laws reſpecting religion, it is neceſſary, that [1.] They, firſt in order, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquaint themſelves with the law of God, that they may form all their laws in agreeableneſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination to it,—they having no power againſt the truth, but for it, Deut. xvii. 18,—20. Joſh. i. 7, 8. Pſalm cxix. 97,—104. 2 Cor. xiii. 8. [2.] They ought to conſult with faithful miniſters of the church, either as met in Synods or otherwiſe; as it may be expected, they know the laws of God relative to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1285200500:21"/>
Deut. xvii. 9,—12. Mal. ii. 7. 2 Chron. xv. 1,—15. Thus, in making theſe laws, church-rulers help magiſtrates with their <hi>direction,</hi> while magiſtrates help them with their <hi>civil encouragements,</hi> 2 Chron. xix. 10, 11. Ezek. xliv. 23, 24 [3.] They ought to require the miniſters, who are in their dominions, faithfully to inſtruct their ſubjects in the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, contained in his word, relative to thoſe points of religion, about which they intend to make laws, that they may be thus prepared, <hi>willingly</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obey them.—Thus Jehoſhaphat firſt ſent <hi>teachers,</hi> and then <hi>judges</hi> throughout his dominions, 2 Chron. xvii. xix [4.] In all matters of religion, great care ought to be taken to eſtabliſh the laws, with and by, the conſent of the ſubjects, or their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives,—thus ſtrengthening theſe laws, through their binding men who are <hi>willing</hi> to obey them;—and the rather as the principal end of ſuch laws is loſt, unleſs men willingly obey them, 2 Chron. xv. 9, 13. xx. 21. Jonah iii. 4, 7. [5.] In theſe laws a ſpecial regard ought to be ſhewn to perſons of a weak and tender conſcience. Political ſhepherds ought never to over drive their flock, but to carry the lambs in their boſom. And, that the very weakeſt of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may be qualified to obey their laws, they ought never to eſtabliſh any thing in religion, but what is <hi>plainly</hi> as well as <hi>really</hi> eſtabliſhed by God in his law;—that ſo nothing may be contrary to their law, but what is plainly contrary to God's law, Ezek. xxxiv. 4.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Though the law of God allows not of magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates attempting to <hi>force</hi> men into the faith, profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or practice of the true religion, or of their puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing any thing relative to it, which is not an open and manifeſt violation of the law of God, and plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the welfare of the commonwealth;—yet it requires them to <hi>reſtrain,</hi> and even <hi>ſeaſonably</hi> and <hi>ſuitably</hi> to <hi>puniſh</hi> blaſphemy, idolatry, and like groſſer corruptions, and inſults upon the true religion, when they become openly notorious, and eſpecially if obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately continued in to the juſt offence and hurt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. (1.) Such <hi>reſtraint</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in ſcripture as an eminent ſervice done to God, Exod. xxxii. 4, 26, 29. 1 Sam. xv. 2, 3. xviii. 22.

Rev. xvii. 14, 16. xix. 17,—19 Song ii. 15 in which laſt text, the word rendered TAKE ordinarily ſignifies an external and forcible taking, compare 2 Sam. i. 10. Judges xii. 6. xvi. 3; 21. Pſalm. cxxxix. 9. Exod. iv. 4. Gen. xxv. 26. xxii. 13. (2.) The end of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of magiſtrates, is the GOOD of the ſubjects, Rom. xiv. 4. Now ſuch corruptions in religion impair <hi>that good,</hi> in preventing the ſpread and ſucceſs of the goſpel, which are ſo exceedingly calculated to render men virtuous and happy, even in this life, 1 Tim. iv. 8. 1 Pet. iii. 11, 12, 13. Tit. ii. 12. and in promoting the hurt of mens morals, ſafety; eſtate, peace or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Rom. i. 21,—32. xvi. 18. 2 Pet. ii. 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, Jude, ver 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19. 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4. iii. 1,—9, 13. ii. 16, 17. 1 Tim. iv. 2,—5. vi. 3, 4. (3) Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and puniſhment are repreſented in ſcripture as a <hi>bleſſing</hi> to be prayed for, 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 4. and as a <hi>bleſſing</hi> for which God ought to be thanked, Ezra vii. 25.—28. Rev. xi. 15, 17. (4.) It is promiſed, that ſuch reſtraint and puniſhment ſhould be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the effuſion of the holy Ghoſt upon the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, Zech. xii. 10, 12, 14. with xiii. 1-6. and that they ſhould tend to the advantage, even of ſome ſeducers, who ſhould be brought to account the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicters their real FRIENDS, Zech. xiii. 4, 5, 6. (5) The ſcripture repreſents EVIL as removed, and GOOD both moral and civil as obtained, by ſuch reſtraints and puniſhments, Deut xvii 2, 5, 7, 10 1 Kings xviii. 40, 41 2 Chron. xiv. 3, 4, 5. and wickedneſs and miſery as overflowing a nation, when neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Eccl. viii. 11.

The ſcripture affords many approven inſtances of ſuch reſtraint or puniſhment of groſs corruptions in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as by Jacob, Gen. xxxv 24 by the judges in the time and country of Job, Job xxxi. 26,—28. by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Exod. xxxii. 4, 20, 22, 29. by the rulers of the ten tribes, Joſh. xxii, 10,—34. by Aſa, 2 Chron. xv. 12, 13, 15. by Jehoſhaphat, 2 Chron. xix. 3,—8. by Joſiah, 2 Chron. xxxiv. 4, 33, 2 Kings xxiii. 5, 20. by Nehemiah, Neh. x. 20. by Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. iii. 29. by Artaxerxes, Ezra vii. 26. and by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant deſtroyers of Antichriſt, Rev. xvii. 16.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Beſide their power, as men, to try all things by the law of God manifeſted to them, and their power of Chriſtian diſcretion (if they are Chriſtians) to judge by the word of God what is for their own ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal advantage, magiſtrates, as ſuch, have a power of POLITICALLY judging and determining, what and how, principles and practices of <hi>the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> are to be connected with political rewards or encouragements; or, what ought to be profeſſed and practiſed by perſons, as members of their political ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in order to promote the real welfare of it, in ſubordination to the glory of God, as King of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (1) If they may enact laws in the matters of God, as hath been proven; and may judge in what is fundamental in religion,—or in that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in expreſs words of ſcripture,—or in matters of the ſecond table of the moral law,—then they muſt have power to judge of that which is plainly deducible from the expreſs words of ſcripture, by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,—and in thoſe matters of the firſt table of the moral law, which as much belong to the law of nature, as any in the ſecond;—have power politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to judge why, and how, ſuch a religious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and practice is to be encouraged by the civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and how, and why, that which is notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to the true religion, is to be diſcouraged. (3.) Without this <hi>political</hi> judging of them, magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates could never determine, Whether the deciſions of eccleſiaſtical courts ought to be ratiſied by their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil authority or not; 1 Theſſ. v. 21. Acts xvii. 11. If
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1285200500:24"/>
in judging of thoſe things, magiſtrates improve the Word, the Spirit, and the faithful miniſters of God, for their counſellors, they bid fair to have a <hi>divine ſentence in their lips, and not to err in judgment,</hi> Deut. xvii. 18,—20. Pſal. cxix. 97,—105. Prov. xvi. 10. Iſa, xxxii. 1. If, neglecting to conſult theſe, magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates give a corrupt ſentence, they ly open to the judgment of God,—to the reſtraint and correction of the collective body of the ſubjects, or their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,—and alſo to eccleſiaſtical cenſure, if they be church-members. (3.) If magiſtrates be <hi>nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> to the Chriſtian church, Iſa. xlix. 23. they ought to prevent her being poiſoned with corrupt food; and hence muſt have a power <hi>politically</hi> to judge what is corrupt, and what is not. (4.) If the magiſtrate be the keeper of the peace of the kingdom, then, if a party in the church, complaining of the groſs errors of the other, ſhould form a furious ſchiſm, he muſt have power <hi>politically</hi> to judge, who is in the right, or in the wrong—who adhere to the truths eſtabliſhed by law, and who do not;—and to ſhew favour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, 1 Theſſ. v. 21. (5.) If magiſtrates may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and puniſh evil doers, they may exerciſe this power over church officers, if, in their Synods, they make blaſphemous or idolatrous decrees, which tend to diſturb the commonwealth, and diſhonour God, the King of nations,—and hence muſt <hi>politically</hi> judge of their conduct by the laws of God and the land.—No covenanted ſubjection to church judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as a member of the church, can deprive them of this <hi>political</hi> judgment, any more than of their right of <hi>cognition</hi> and <hi>diſcretion</hi> as men and Chriſtians. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates <hi>political</hi> judgment, how principles or practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces are to be connected with civil encouragements or diſcouragements, is no infallible rule of church courts judging, how principles and practices ought to be connected with eccleſiaſtical encouragements or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: nor are the deciſions of eccleſiaſtical courts any infallible rule to direct magiſtrates. But the law of God is the <hi>only infallible</hi> and <hi>ſupreme</hi> rule to both. Nor is the deciſion of the one <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to that of the other; but both, as well as every man's right to judge for himſelf according to the law of God, what he is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1285200500:25"/>
to believe and practiſe in order to his own peace and comfort, and his joyful anſwering in the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, are <hi>ſupreme</hi> in their reſpective depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſubordinated only to the judgment of God himſelf.—But, to argue the matter ſtill more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If magiſtracy, conſcience, and human rights, natural and civil, be all <hi>derived from God,</hi> as all but Atheiſts muſt allow, magiſtrates can have no more power, <hi>authoritatively</hi> to tolerate ſin, than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can command it. If God, by virtue of the infinite perfection of his nature, have no will, no power, <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively</hi> to proclaim liberty to commit ſin, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate any ſuch power to the magiſtrate. Nor can the magiſtrate account to God for exceeding his power in licenſing that which is infinitely injurious to him, more than the Britiſh king's Lion-keeper hath power, or could be accountable for looſing and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the lions in the Tower upon His Majeſty. If conſcience derive all its power from God, it can have no more power to enjoin any thing ſinful, than Lord North hath to hire ruffians to aſſaſſinate his Sovereign. If all human rights be derived from God, the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſupreme proprietor of all things, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they can <hi>authorize</hi> men to contrive or commit any thing ſinful, or can <hi>protect</hi> them in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mens ſtate in this world is neither <hi>ſeparated</hi> nor <hi>ſeparable</hi> from, but cloſely connected with their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate. And magiſtracy is an <hi>ordinance of God,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him for his own glory, and to promote the chief end of mankind in glorifying him, Rom. xiii. 2. Prov. xvi. 4. 1 Cor. x. 31. 1 Pet. iv. 11. Rom. xii. 36. But, how, Sir, do magiſtrates promote this end, if they give the ſame <hi>degree of protection,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, not of encouragement, to the ſoul-ruining and practice-corrupting deluſions and abominations of Satan, as they do the eternally ſaving religion of God and his Chriſt?—if they give the ſame countenance to them, who to the corruption of mens moral beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and their eternal damnation,—defame Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah to them as <hi>mere matter,</hi> a <hi>mere man,</hi> a <hi>mere crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> a <hi>worker of contradiction and nonſenſe,</hi>—as they do to thoſe, who faithfully proclaim his infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,

and glorious works of redemption, publiſh his truths, and promote the preſent and future holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs of mankind?—If God chiefly aim at the glorifying of himſelf, in the advancement of the kingdom of Chriſt; how can magiſtrates, who are appointed by him, as his vicegerents, for promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his glory on earth, be allowed, far leſs obliged by him, to exert their power, as much for protecting or promoting the kingdom of the devil, as for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the kingdom of Chriſt? Indeed magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates are not the deputies of Chriſt as mediator, but they are of God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and all their adminiſtrations are, by him, ſubjected to Chriſt, as <q rend="inline">"Head over all things to his church,"</q> Prov. viii. 15, 16. Mat. xxviii. 18. Eph. i. 22. Why then ought they not to concur with God, in advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdom of Chriſt, eſpecially as this mightily promotes the temporal as well as the eternal welfare of their ſubjects, Prov. xiv. 34. Iſa. i. 19. iii. 10. Pſal. cxii, cxxvii, cxxviii.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Magiſtrates are expreſly repreſented in ſcripture, <hi>as miniſters of God for good to men,</hi>—rulers deputed by, and under him, Rom. xiii. 4.

How can they be miniſters of God <hi>for good to men,</hi> if they have power, only to puniſh theſe crimes which ſtrike immediately againſt their bodies or external property, but no power to puniſh crimes, as they provoke God's wrath againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—if they have power to reſtrain the petty thief, robber, or other leſs hurtful things,—but none to prevent the kindling of God's wrath againſt the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the debauching of mens conſciences and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, by blaſphemy, hereſy, idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may quickly do more real miſchief to a nation, than ten thouſand thieves or robbers could do?—After God hath expreſly commanded to puniſh murderers as <hi>deſtroyers of his image,</hi> Gen. ix. 6—have his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters no power to puniſh murder, as a deſtruction of his rational creatures, or a ſacrificing them to devils, Pſal. cvi. 37?

God is the only abſolute, ſupreme and infallible Lawgiver; He alone hath power to conſtitute any thing a part of religion. But that no more hinders his magiſtratical vicegerents to make <hi>political</hi> laws in favours of what he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and inſtituted in religion, than Chriſt being Head of the church can hinder her ſubordinate rulers to make eccleſiaſtical conſtitutions in favours of the truth, in his name, Pſalm lxxxii. 1, 6. Rom. xiii. 1,—6. 1 Fet. ii. 13, 14. 2. Neither magiſtrates nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters can make any law which of themſelves, and as their deeds, bind mens conſcience. Their authority is not infallibly exerciſed; it doth not reach to the inward actings of conſcience. They cannot oblige conſcience to theſe actings, or take any cognizance of them. They cannot free it from any guilt contracted by them, or reward it if it doth well, or puniſh or cenſure it if it doth amiſs. Nor are their conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but God's law, the ſtandard by which it ſhall be judged at the laſt day.—But they may make laws or conſtitutions, which, as originating from, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to, and adopted and ratiſied by the law of God. bind men to obey for conſcience ſake, Rom. xiii. 1,—4. Mat. xviii. 19. 3. God's being the only Lawgiver of men under the Old Teſtament as much as now, did not hinder Moſes, David, Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah, Joſiah, Nehemiah, Nebuchadnezzar the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, Darius the Mede, Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes, Perſians, or the king of Nineveh to make civil laws in favours of the true religion. 4. If God alone be the Lawgiver and Lord of the conſcience, it nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarily follows, that magiſtrates and conſcience, who are his deputies, can have no power to warrant, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe or protect, any thing forbidden by his law, 2 Cor. xiii 8, 10.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. II. <q rend="inline">"Every man hath a natural right to judge for himſelf, what he ought to do or forbear, eſpecially in religion. He is to be fully perſuaded in his own mind, and to follow the dictates of his own conſcience. Even the law of God is a rule to him, as he underſtands it in his own conſcience. To force

any man to do any thing contrary to his conſcience, is to force him to ſin, for whatſoever is not of ſaith is ſin; and to puniſh him for following the dictates of his conſcience is to puniſh him for doing his duty."</q> ANSW. [1.] Already you have made mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſupreme governor of their actions, exalting it above The Moſt High GOD. [2.] Every man hath a natural right derived from God, to <hi>judge all things by the law of God, and hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſſ. v. 21. He hath a right to judge by the law of God what is neceſſary to be profeſſed and practiſed, in order to the peace of his conſcience, and his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with, and receiving of favours from God. But that no more hinders magiſtrates <hi>politically</hi> to judge what profeſſion and practice are proper for men, as members of ſuch a particular commonwealth,—or what relative to religion is to be connected with civil encouragements or diſcouragements,—than it hinders church-rulers, eccleſiaſtically to judge and define what profeſſion or practice is neceſſary, in order to comfortable fellowſhip with ſuch a particular church. [3.] Mens conſcience is no Lawgiver at all, but a <hi>witneſs</hi> of their conduct, and a <hi>judge,</hi> which enquires into the meaning of God's law, and directs according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,—and which compares their qualities, profeſſion, and practice with the law of God, and if faithful, approves or diſapproves accordingly. [4.] The law of God, not men's conſcience, is their <hi>ſupreme and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſallible rule,</hi> which binds even conſcience itſelf, Mark xii. 30. 1 John v. 3. and whatever men do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, is ſinful, let their conſcience approve it as much as they will, 1 John iii. 4. Lev. v. 17, 18. Acts xxvi. 9. 10. 1 Tim i. 13,—16. Whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the perſuaſion of a good conſcience, founded on the word of God, is ſin. It is a ſin for mens conſcience to err in dictating any thing not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeable to the law of God.—How abſurd to pretend, that this fin can render another ſin duty, or a duty ſinful in itſelf! [5] If mens conſcience, in itſelf, or in its directing, perſuading or inſtigating influence be ſuſtained, as the immediate rule of their conduct, without reſpect to the word of God, then either their conſcience muſt be <hi>inſallible</hi> in its dictates,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1285200500:41"/>
which it certainly is not, in either ſaints or ſinners, in this world, Rom. vii. 14, 23. Prov. xxviii. 26. Jer. xvii 9. Rom. viii. 7, 8. Tit. i. 15. or, if it be <hi>fallible,</hi> God muſt have eſtabliſhed for men a <hi>fallible</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful rule</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi>—and ſo be the author of confuſion in religion, ſince different conſciences dictate different things in it.—To make mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience their rule in religion, would make God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and commander of wickedneſs,—by conſcience, requiring the tranſgreſſion of his own law.—It would make him not only acquit from criminality, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as duty, the moſt damnable errors, horrid blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, deteſtable abominations, and cruel barbarities, if but dictated by the conſciences of Heathens, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Papiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their religion.—It would make him the author of mens ruin, if it were procured by a way which ſeemed right in their own eyes, Prov. xvi. 25.—It would render it abſolutely impoſſible to convince men of the ſinfulneſs of any thing they had done according to the dictates of their conſcience, be it ever ſo contrary to the law of God. It would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it improper for men to repent of or mourn over any blaſphemy, murder of ſaints, or the like, which their deluded conſcience had dictated to them, or to aſk, receive, or praiſe God for the pardoning of it, contrary to 1 Tim. i. 13,—16. with Acts xxvi. 9,—11. Gal. i. 13, 14. Phil. iii. 6. It would open a wide gap for mens doing whatever they pleaſed, without being chargeable by, at leaſt any man, for it—If men ſhould be executed for the moſt horrid blaſphemy, or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable idolatry, high treaſon, or any other deed dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by their conſcience, they would die martyrs for righteouſneſs ſake.—And men ought to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their conſcience dictated to them concerning their ſtate, experience or duty, however contrary to the teſtimony of God, contained in his word,—contrary to Pſalm iii. 22. &amp; xvi 11. xlii. 5, 11. Rev. iii. 17. [6.] To pretend that the law of God, not in itſelf, but <hi>as underſtood by mens conſcience,</hi> is their rule, is abſurd. It, in the Popiſh manner, repreſents the law of God as deſtitute of ſenſe and authority in itſelf, and as deriving it from a creature. It, in the Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh manner, makes the <hi>light within</hi> the rule of mens
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1285200500:42"/>
conduct. It exalts every man to an equality with, or rather ſuperiority above God, having power to give regulating ſenſe and authority to his word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as an erroneous and defiled conſcience pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It aboliſheth every real ſtandard of religion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's particular apprehenſions of the meaning of God's word being his binding rule. The ſame word of God becomes the ſtandard of <hi>Calviniſm, Popery, Socinianiſm,</hi> &amp;c. as different men underſtand it. It ſaps the foundation of all mutual truſt and confidence among men; and opens a wide inlet for all manner of villany and diſſimulation. According to it, mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, oaths, vows, and covenants,—their ſworn and ſubſcribed Creeds, Articles, Confeſſions, Formulas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bind them, not according to the common mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words,—but according to the meaning which their conſcience, however ſeared, biaſſed, or deluded, puts upon them. In fine, it plunges men into the depths of Atheiſm, according to which every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and acts what is right in his own eyes. [7] If mens private judgment of their own acts hindered the magiſtrates ſupreme <hi>political</hi> judgment, no laws could be made in matters of religion or any thing elſe; as ſome would be readily of a different mind, even in the fundamentals of religion and virtue.—While ſome believed that Chriſt was not true God or true man, or that idols might be worſhipped, others would believe that oaths might be lawfully violated, heretical princes aſſaſſinated, or women and goods uſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. [8.] If other mens private judgment be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be their ſupreme rule and reaſon of conduct, it will neceſſarily follow, that magiſtrates private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be the rule of their conduct; and that they ought to make and execute ſuch laws as they believe in their own heart to be proper, be they as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and tyrannical as they will. [9.] It is not with mens conſcience, and its judgment in religion, any more than in matters of common honeſty, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical authority intermeddles, but with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal words and deeds. It only reſtrains and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch of thoſe as are <hi>manifeſtly contrary to the laws of God and the land,</hi> and <hi>as they are hurtful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1285200500:43"/>
and <hi>the public honour of God as King of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> [10.] If all proper means of conviction be uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with men who obſtinately perſiſt in groſs hereſy, blaſphemy, and idolatry without effect; their miſtake doth not ariſe from a conſcience regulating duty, but from one ſtiffened againſt duty. And it is perhaps ſometimes as difficult to convince a hardened thief, robber, or adulterer of his miſtake, as it is to convince a hardened heretic. Men are puniſhable, not for what their conſcience, as the deputy of God, dictates, but for what they would not have done, if they had any proper conſcience of duty. [11.] If men ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and eſpecially wilfully refuſe to uſe the means of ealightening their conſcience by the word of God, they but add to their crimes both before God and men, by pretending conſcience. [12.] Mens conſcience being as much a director in their conduct towards men, as in their conduct towards God, its influence muſt have as much force to keep them from accountableneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Even the undue delay of cenſure or puniſhment encourageth men in wickedneſs, much more would the total overlooking of it, Eccl. viii. 11. (2.)

            <p>OBJECT. IX. <q rend="inline">"By rebuking his diſciples, who would have commanded fire from heaven to conſume thoſe Samaritans who refuſed him lodging in his way to Jeruſalem; and by his declaring, That he came <hi>not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave</hi> them, Luke ix. 51,—56. our benevolent Saviour plainly intimated, That under the goſpel, magiſtrates ought to lay no reſtraint on hereſy, blaſphemy or idolatry."</q> ANSW. (1.) As theſe Samaritans did not live under magiſtrates or laws, which eſtabliſhed the true religion, it is not pled, that even their groſs hereſy, blaſphemy, or ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, however notorious and obſtinate, could have been regularly puniſhable by men. (2) They were in this matter guilty of no hereſy, blaſphemy or idolatry,—or of attempting to ſeduce or diſturb Chriſt or his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,—but merely of not giving lodging to a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Jew, of whoſe Meſſiahſhip they had but little, if any information or proof. (3.) Though the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1285200500:47"/>
had been guilty of groſs hereſy, blaſphemy and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, publicly and obſtinately profeſſed and practiſed, contrary to the civil laws of the country, and been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly puniſhable,—Chriſt's diſciples being no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in that place, had no right to call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. (4.) The diſciples never ſought to have the contempt ſhown to themſelves and their Maſter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the civil law, but by the <hi>miraculous vengeance of God.</hi> Without any warrant from God, and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their own proud, paſſionate, and revengeful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they would have required him to work a miracle for the deſtruction of theſe poor ignorant Samaritans.—So, if you will drag in this text, it ought to be to prove, That neither God nor miniſters ought to reſtrain heretics, blaſphemers, or idolaters. (5.) While Chriſt was in his debaſed ſtate, obeying and ſuffering for the ſalvation of mankind, it would have been extremely improper for God, viſibly to puniſh every ſlight put upon him. But his coming to <hi>ſave men</hi> with an everlaſting ſalvation, can no more infer, that he came to protect criminals from juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by men, than that he came to ſave obſtinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers from hell. He came to <hi>ſave mens lives,</hi> by ſaving them from their ſins, not by protecting and warranting them in a public and obſtinate commiſſion of them. There is no hint in ſcripture, that he, who was manifeſted to deſtroy the works of the devil, came to procure men a liberty of conſcience, or a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical licence or protection in public and groſs hereſy, blaſphemy, and idolatry, more than in theft, murder, adultery. It would be highly blaſphemous to ſuppoſe it.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. X. <q rend="inline">"Chriſt requires us not to judge others,—to judge nothing before the time. Mat. vii. 1. 1 Cor. iv. 5. We ought to believe our own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in religion to be as probably erroneous, as thoſe of our opponents; and if they do not acknowledge themſelves heretics, blaſphemers, or idolaters, we ought never to hold them ſuch, or plead for their being reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as ſuch."</q> ANSW. (1.) We muſt never raſhly or uncharitably judge others, or judge their hearts and intentions, which God alone knoweth. But that will no more infer, that magiſtrates ought to give no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1285200500:48"/>
about religious matters, than that magiſtrates and miniſters ſhould judge of nothing at all reſpecting either God or men, but encourage every perſon to live as his inclinations direct him. (2.) Is there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no certainty in religion? If men ought to be <hi>complete Sceptics</hi> in it; why not as well <hi>downright ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiſts?</hi> (3) If mens own acknowlegments be ſuſtained as the ſtandard of our judgment concerning them, what rare work muſt enſue! None ought to be held blaſphemers, heretics, or idolaters, till they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come penitent convicts. None ought to be held thieves murderers, calumniators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till they acknowledge themſelves ſuch. All impenitent criminals muſt thus eſcape every degree of infamy, reſtraint or puniſhment.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XI. <q rend="inline">"Men ought to be <hi>perſuaded,</hi> not <hi>forced</hi> into faith and holineſs. It is in vain to attempt rooting out corruptions, eſpecially in religion, out of mens outward behaviour unleſs they be firſt rooted out of their hearts."</q> ANSW. (1.) It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no ſmall ſhare of <hi>ignorance, impudence</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> to inſinuate that the many thouſands of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant advocates for the magiſtrates power to reſtrain groſs hereſy, blaſphemy or idolatry, plead for the FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CING of men to faith and holineſs, when they ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly plead for the contrary. (2) None ought to be forced into the faith and profeſſion of the true religion, as hath been repeatedly declared, but all proper methods taken to render their compliance ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and voluntary. Yet that will not infer, that no man ought to be reſtrained from, or even <hi>ſuitably</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonably</hi> puniſhed for, open and groſs hereſy, blaſphemy or idolatry, which, while they publicly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, inſult, and undermine the true religion,—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce terrible immoralities and diſorders in churches and nations, and draw upon them the ruinous ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God;—and far leſs will it infer, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, as vicegerents of God, ought, in his name and authority, to <hi>licenſe</hi> a falſe religion, and promiſe men protection and encouragement in it No magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate hath power to force me to eſteem, love, delight in, ſympathize with, maintain, or even commend my neighbour. But he hath power to refuſe me a warrant to calumniate, rob or murder him, and even
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1285200500:49"/>
to reſtrain or puniſh me for ſo doing. It would be abſurd to attempt forcing of the Britiſh Jacobites, to believe and ſolemnly profeſs, that K. George, not the Pretender is rightful Sovereign of this kingdom. But would it therefore be abſurd, to reſtrain and puniſh them for publicly and inſolently reviling him as an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper,—or ſeducing their fellow ſubjects to dethrone him,—or for taking arms againſt him, or paying his juſt revenues to the Pretender? (3) It is certain, that Chriſt, who hath power over the hearts of all men, curbed the external corruptions of the Jewiſh buyers and ſellers in the temple, without firſt caſting the corruptions out of their heart. And pray would you have all thieves, robbers, murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have full liberty in their courſes, till their wickedneſs can be got rooted out of their heart?</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XII. <q rend="inline">"Such is the reaſonableneſs and the glory of divine truths, that if they be but freely, clearly and diſtinctly preached, their native luſire will render them victorious over every error and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in religion, however boldly publiſhed, or craftily varniſhed. What a ſingular advantage hath it been to Britain, that Deiſts have had full freedom to make their attacks upon the Chriſtian religion, and ſo to occaſion ſo many glorious defences of it?"</q> ANSW. (1.) Did not God under the Old Teſtament, know the conquering power of his truth as well as you do? Did not Chriſt know it when he drove the buyers and ſellers from the temple. (2) Did the inexpreſſibly amiable and edifying conduct of Jeſus Chriſt, the way, the truth and the life, render him the univerſal, the fixed DARLING of the Jewiſh nation, among whom he went about doing good? You dare not pretend it. And yet it is certain that examples do more affect than inſtructions. (3) You muſt not only, with Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, deny original ſin, but effectually diſprove it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your objection can have any ſenſe in it.—While men are ſo blinded by Satan and their own luſts, and ſo full of enmity againſt God, they cannot but be much more diſpoſed to receive and practiſe error, than to diſcern, embrace, and practiſe goſpel-truths, however clearly and faithfully preached, 1 Cor. ii. 14.

(5.) If pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians, by encouraging others in groſs error and wickedneſs, provoke God to give up themſelves to ſtrong deluſions, that they may believe lies, will the native luſtre of divine truths then enlighten and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate them?

This can no more prove, that magiſtrates ought to make and execute no laws reſpecting the duties required by the firſt table of the moral law, than it will prove that they ought to make no laws reſpecting duties of the ſecond table,—ſince church-rulers are as much authorized by God to govern, in the one as in the other.

XV. <q rend="inline">"For almoſt three hundred years after Chriſt, the truths of the goſpel gloriouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt errors and corruptions, without any care of magiſtrates to reſtrain or puniſh the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous."</q> ANSW. (1.) It was proper, that the Chriſtian religion ſhould be ſpread in the world, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the countenance of the civil magiſtrate, but alſo in oppoſition to his ſevere laws and bloody perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it might the more abundantly appear to be of God.

In that period, it prevailed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the moſt furious oppoſition, and the cruel perſecution and murder of millions of its adherents, as well as without magiſtratical aſſiſtance. Will you therefore plead, that peace and freedom in preaching the goſpel ought to be hated and avoided, and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſecution coveted and prayed for? (3) In that period, the miraculous powers, which atteſted the doctrines of Chriſt did more than balance the want of magiſtratical helpfulneſs to the truth, Heb. ii 4.—(4.) In that period, the hardſhips to which Chriſtians were expoſed, deterred ſuch naughty perſons from entering the church, as might have plagued her with their blaſphemies and hereſies. (5) And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, even then blaſphemers and heretics did no ſmall hurt to the church.

            <p>OBJECT. XVI. <q rend="inline">"It is horrid cruelty and unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian perſecution to reſtrain or puniſh men for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teaching, and worſhipping, according to the dictates of their own conſcience, as charity obligeth us to believe is the caſe with heretics, blaſphemers and idolaters.—It is <hi>altogether diabolical,</hi> the <hi>very worſt part of Popery,</hi> and that which <hi>peculiarly ſupports the whole Antichriſtian ſcheme.</hi>—Men ought to follow the dictates even of an erring conſcience."</q> ANSW. (1.) Where is your proof, from either ſcripture or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that an erring conſcience binds men to believe, teach or practiſe, groſs hereſy, blaſphemy or idolatry, any more than their promiſes or vows to do evil, bind to performance?—or than it can bind them to theft, murder, adultery, calumny, or the like?—If we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1285200500:53"/>
have an erring conſcience, our immediate duty is to get rid of that error, by the illumination of God's word, as being ſinful in itſelf, eſpecially if procured through ſloth or wickedneſs; it will hinder our right performance of duty, but can never make fin lawful. If, Sir, you can believe, that an erring conſcience, can outdo the almighty power of God, in making he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, blaſphemy, or idolatry innocent things, you may quickly believe, that a Romiſt prieſt can outdo his Maker, in making a God, and then eating him, in the myſtery of tranſubſtantiation. (2.) Even when conſcience is perfectly clear, pure and unbiaſſed, it is wholly ſubordinated and ſubjected to the authority of God's law.—How can the entrance of ſinful error into it, exalt it above his law, and make ſuch a God of it, as can ſtamp its wicked dictates into incontroulable laws, in oppoſition to the mandates of Jehovah him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—This will not only prove, that Adam and Eve became Gods by the entrance of fin, but go far to juſtify Popes and devils in the whole of their conduct. (3.) If the devil, who deceiveth the world, get into mens conſcience by his ſtrong deluſions, hath God allotted him that as a quiet city of refuge, from which no means ought to be uſed to diſlodge him, and from which he may uſe the whole man unreſtrained in his ſervice,—in ſacrificing children to Moloch, murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaints, blaſpheming God, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> (4.) Where is your proof, that I ought to believe, that the man, who hath acceſs to the Bible, acts according to the dictates of his conſcience in groſs hereſy, blaſphemy or idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, any more than that he acts according to them, in murder, treaſon, theft, unchaſtity, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Men have laboured and ſuffered as much, in courſes of the latter kind, as in thoſe of the former, and died as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently at laſt. (5.) If pretence of conſcience, and more than pretence in favours of ſin we can never be certain of, be a ſufficient ground for magiſtrates licenſing, encouraging and protecting men in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and blaſpheming God, or robbing him of his worſhip, to beſtow it on devils,—or in robbing his church of his oracles or ordinances,—in murdering the ſouls of men, and ſowing the ſeeds of confuſion and every evil work,—Why ought it not to warrant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1285200500:54"/>
their licenſing, encouraging and protecting them in high treaſon, calumny, theft, robbery, murder?—It is hoped, you, who are ſo generous in allowing men, if they can but pretend conſcience for it, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed and rob Jehovah, will be as ready to allow them equal freedom, if they can but pretend conſcience, in abuſing and injuring yourſelf. If God's giving up men to <hi>ſtrong deluſions,</hi> that they may believe lies warrant magiſtrates to encourage or protect them, in ſpreading groſs hereſy, or in open blaſphemy and idolatry, Why ought not his giving them up to <hi>vile affections,</hi>—to their own hearts luſts, equally to warrant their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and protecting of them in open whoredom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiality, inceſt, robbery, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Men can as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer their luſts and cleanſe their hearts, as they can rectify the errors of their conſcience. (6.) It is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly certain, that God himſelf, under the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament appointed magiſtrates to reſtrain and puniſh men for blaſphemy and idolatry, let their conſcience dictate them as ſtrongly as it pleaſed.—Had men in theſe early ages no conſcience to govern them? Or did God then, like the old faſhioned Proteſtants, not underſtand human liberty and the rights of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?—Did he indeed then ſo far miſtake his way, as to appoint what is ſo <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>diabolical;</hi> what is the very <hi>worſt part of Popery,</hi> and the <hi>principal ſupport of that abominable ſyſtem?</hi> Or hath God, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, cruelty and tyranny, been changed?

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1285200500:57"/>
overturning your preceding objection, and adopting the <hi>divine law</hi> of nature, inſtead of <hi>your civil law,</hi> as the ſupreme ſtandard of magiſtratical adminiſtration. (2.) According to your objection, parents, maſters, children and ſervants, muſt regulate their performance of relative duties, merely by the law of nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance from the directions of the Holy Ghoſt in ſcripture. No parents or maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt inſtruct their children or ſervants in the knowledge of the doctrines, promiſes, laws, worſhip, or virtue required in the Bible, as theſe relations <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend no more on Revelation than magiſtracy doth.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you to prove they do. In performing the duty of our natural or civil relations, we muſt act as <hi>mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi> ignorant of, or pouring contempt on the inſpired oracles of the Great GOD, our Saviour.—What hurt have the laws of revelation done to ſuch relative duties, that they muſt be thus infamouſly excluded from being any part of a rule of them? (3) No man can truly obey the law of nature, without heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and chearfully improving whatever revelations God is pleaſed to beſtow on him,—as ſuch revelations proceed from the ſame divine authority as the law of nature; and muſt be a noted means of promoting true and proper obedience to it.—To exclude divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, when granted, from regulating our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of relative duties, muſt therefore not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an <hi>heatheniſh</hi> contempt of the ſcriptures, but to an <hi>atheiſtical</hi> contempt of the law of nature, which neceſſarily requires us to adopt divine Revelation for our ſupreme rule, whenever it is graciouſly granted to us.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XX. <q rend="inline">"Many of the above-mentioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of magiſtrates care about religion, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and puniſhment of idolaters, blaſphemers, and falſe prophets, related merely to the Jewiſh Theocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which was <hi>typical,</hi> and therefore not now to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied."</q> ANSW. [1.] Many of the above-mentioned inſtances, particularly thoſe reſpecting Heathens, or contained in the promiſes to the goſpel church, have not the leaſt appearance of being typical. Nay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you to prove that the inſtances of Jewiſh rulers were <hi>merely</hi> typical. [2.] Theſe typical magiſtrates of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1285200500:58"/>
Jewiſh nation alſo exerciſed laws relative to murder, theft, unchaſtity, treaſon, and other matters of the ſecond table of the moral law. Ought therefore no magiſtrates now to do ſo? The laws reſpecting duties of the ſecond table pertained as much to the Jewiſh Theocracy, as thoſe relating to the firſt. Muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian magiſtrate, for fear of copying the Jewiſh Theocracy, meddle with no morality at all? [3.] Muſt every thing that was once typical, be now, under the goſpel, excluded from regulating authority? Muſt all the excellent patterns of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph, Job. Moſes, Aaron, Samuel, David, and other Hebrew ſaints be rejected as typical and uſeleſs?—Muſt all the laws directing to elect men, <hi>fearing God, and hating covetouſneſs,</hi> to be magiſtrates, or directing them to judge juſtly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially and prudently, and to puniſh murderers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, thieves, robbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be diſcarded as typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal? Muſt the weekly Sabbath, public faſts and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings be laid aſide as typical,—a mere ſign between God and the Iſraelites? Muſt the ten commandments, and all the explications of them in the Old Teſtament be diſcarded, as publiſhed in a typical manner, and to a typical people, and uſed as the principal part of their rule of government in the Jewiſh Theocracy? [4] As the Jewiſh church was a REAL church, and not MERELY TYPICAL, ſo their State was a REAL commonwealth or kingdom, and not MERELY TY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PICAL. Whatever therefore pertained to it, <hi>as a real commonwealth,</hi> is imitable in any other. [5.] The Jewiſh Church and State were as REALLY DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINCT, as the Church and State are now; though I do not ſay preciſely in the ſame manner. (1.) They differed in reſpect of REGULATING LAWS. The ceremonial law directed the Jewiſh church. The ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial directed the affairs of their ſtate. (2.) They differed in their reſpective ACTS. The Jews worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God, offered ſacrifices, and received ſacraments, not as members of that ſtate, but as members of that church. They puniſhed evil doers by fines, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, baniſhment, burning, ſtoning, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and fought with enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not as a church,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1285200500:59"/>
but as a ſtate. (3.) They differed in reſpect of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TROVERSIES. To the church pertained the <hi>matters of the Lord,</hi> and a judging of leproſies, and between ſtatutes and judgments. To the ſtate belonged the <hi>matters of the king,</hi> and to judge between blood and blood, 2 Chron. xix. 10, 11. Deut. xvii. 8. (4) They differed in reſpect of OFFICERS. The prieſts were the only ſtated officers in the church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets a kind of occaſional ones. Elders, Judges and Kings were governors in the State. The prieſts might not take the civil ſword out of the hand of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; nor the magiſtrates offer ſacrifices, burn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, or otherwiſe execute the prieſt's office. (5.) They differed in reſpect of CONTINUANCE. When the Jewiſh civil power was taken away by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the conſtitution of their church remained, in the days of our Saviour's debaſement. And even now the Jews pretend to be a church, but not to be a ſtate. (6.) They differed in reſpect of VARIATION. The conſtitution of their church remained much the ſame under Moſes, Joſhua, the Judges, the Kings, and after the captivity. But the form of the ſtate underwent great alterations. (7.) They differed in reſpect of MEMBERS. Proſelytes of the covenant were complete members of the Jewiſh church; but had not the ſame dignities or marriages allowed them in the State, as the natural Iſraelites. Nor had the proſelytes of the gate any church privileges, though they had ſome civil ones. (8.) They were governed by different COURTS. The church had her courts of the Synagogue, and her eccleſiaſtical Sanhedrin.—The ſtate had her courts of the gate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and her civil Sanhedrin;—though often ſome Levites were judges in both, as our ruling elders in the church, may, at the ſame time, be civil judges, Exod. xxiv. 1. Deut. xvii 8,—12. 1 Chron. xxxiii. 4, &amp; xxvi. 30, 32. 2 Chron. xix 8, 10, 11. Jer. xxvi. 8,—11, 16. xviii. 18. with Deut xvii. 10, 11, 12. Ezek vii. 26 2 Kings vi. 32. Zech. vii. 1,—3.

Some Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbins expreſly diſtinguiſh between their judges and their church elders in the ſame places. (9) They
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1285200500:60"/>
differed in their CENSURE of offenders. In the church, offenders were ſuſpended from ſacred fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by <hi>a caſting out of the Synagogue,</hi> or <hi>a cutting off from God's people or congregation.</hi> John ix. 22. &amp; xii. 42.

Gen. xxv. 17. In the ſtate, they were caſt off by death or ontlawry. (10) Profane and ſcandalous perſons were excluded from the Jewiſh temple-ſervice and paſſover, while they retained their civil rights in the ſtate, Ezek xliv. 7, 9 Deut. xxiii. 18. Jer. vii. 9,—11. Ezek. xxiii. 38, 39. 2 Chron. xxiii. 19. with 1 Cor. v. 11. Pſal. cxviii. 19, 20. &amp; xv, 1,—5. &amp; xxiv. 3, 4. &amp; l. 16,—20. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. xxvi. 22, 26.

By Chriſt kings ſtill reign, and princes decree juſtice, even all the judges of the earth, Prov. viii. 15, 16. with Eph. i. 22. (6.) The manifeſted will of God was the proper ſtatute book of the Jewiſh civil law, Deut. xvii. The will of God manifeſted in the laws of nature and revelation, are the ſupreme ſtandard of all civil laws in the world, in which every human conſtitution ought to be founded, and by which the whole binding force of it is circumſcribed, Acts iv. 19. &amp; v. 29. Pſal, ii. 10,—12. and hence hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws become an <hi>ordinance of God,</hi> Rom. xiii. 2. (7.) The judicial laws of the Hebrew nation, regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which pertained to their kings, judges, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, fields, houſes, injuries, crimes, puniſhments, mortgages, marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exod. xxi,—xxiii. Deut. xviii, xx, Lev. xviii, xx. Num. xxxvi,—xxxviii, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our civil laws regulate the ſame things. (8.) Among the Jews, notorious diſobedience to the declared will of God was held rebellion againſt him, the King of the nation, and to be condignly puniſhed, as it tended to the good of the ſtate, Heb. ii. 2. &amp; x. 28. Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſobedience to the manifeſted will of God ought to be ſtill held as rebellion againſt Him, as king of nations, and to be condignly puniſhed, as tends to the welfare of the ſtate,—magiſtrates being ſtill ſet up by God to be <hi>terrors, revengers,</hi> and <hi>puniſhers of evil doers,</hi> and bound <hi>not to bear the ſword in vain,</hi> Rom. xiii. 1,—5. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. Nor hath it been yet proven, That our magiſtrates, who have the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ought to pay leſs real regard to them in the ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of crimes, than the Jewiſh rulers did. (9.) The Jewiſh magiſtrates were appointed to promote the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the church, in order to promote the welfare of the ſtate, in ſubordination to the honour of God, the King of the nation. Magiſtrates are ſtill bound to do the ſame, as they have opportunity, Iſa. xlix. 23. &amp; lx. 3, 10, 16 Rev. xvii. 16. &amp; xxi. 24, 26. Rom. xiii. 1,—6. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. 1 Tim. ii. 1,—4. (10.) The Jewiſh church and ſtate, as hath been juſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1285200500:62"/>
now proven, were really diſtinct from, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of each other, having different laws, officers, courts, privileges, penalties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The chriſtian church and the civil ſtate of Chriſtians are no leſs diſtinct and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of each other. (11.) Nevertheleſs, the purity of the Jewiſh church, contributed much to the welfare of their ſtate, and the right management of their ſtate to the proſperity of their church; and bad manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the one always tended to the hurt of the other, Deut. xxviii,—xxxii Lev. xxvi. Judges i,—xiii. 1 Sam. ii.—to 2 Chron. xxxvi Iſa. i—to Mal. iv. Iſa i. 19, 20. &amp; iii. 10, 11. And ſtill righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exalteth a nation, and ſin is the reproach and ruin of any people, Prov. xiv. 34. (12.) God never commanded the Jewiſh magiſtrates to <hi>force</hi> their true religion upon their Heathen neighbours, Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, Moabites, Ammonites, or Syrians, whom they conquered, or to put them to death for their idolatry. Nor hath He ever commanded magiſtrates, who have embraced the true Chriſtian religion to FORCE men by fire or ſword, or any like puniſhments, to embrace and profeſs it,—or to inſlict t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

(13) Never did God, that I know of, require the Jewiſh magiſtrates to puniſh any of their ſubjects for <hi>leſſer faults,</hi> however open or manifeſt, or to puniſh them for the <hi>ſimple neglect</hi> of duties <hi>ſtrictly religious,</hi>—or to annex ſentences of outlawry and of death to eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>cutting off</hi> by excommunication from the church. Nor can I find, that he hath enjoined any ſuch thing upon the Chriſtian magiſtrate. (14) Among the Jews, ſome things partaking of both a civil and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, did, in theſe different reſpects, fall under the government of both Church and State. Even cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion itſelf was a national badge as well as a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſeal of God's covenant.—Among Chriſtians, public faſts and thankſgivings, calling of Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do, in different reſpects, fall under the power of both church and ſtate.—Pretend therefore no more, that there is a <hi>total difference</hi> between the caſe of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,

1. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in their FOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DATION. Magiſtracy is founded on God's univerſal dominion over all nations; and hence the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the <hi>immediate ſupreme rule</hi> of its adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſcriptures become the rule of them only as introduced by the law of nature, requiring magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates as well as others to believe and obey whatever revelation, duly atteſted, God is pleaſed to grant them.—or, by magiſtrates ſubjecting their conſciences, as followers of Chriſt, to the ſcriptures as their only rule to direct them how to glorify God and enjoy him for ever. But eccleſiaſtical power is founded in the oeconomical or mediatorial headſhip of Jeſus Chriſt over his church, as his ſpiritual kingdom; and hence the immediate ſtandard for regulating the exerciſe of it, is that Revelation, which God hath given to, and by him, in his word;—and the laws of nature have a regulating force in the church by virtue of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precepts of ſcripture, as 1 Cor. xiv. 26, 40. vi. 12. xvi. 14. Phil. iv. 8. Mat. vii. 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in their IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEDIATE OBJECT. Magiſtratical power immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relates only to <hi>things external,</hi> pertaining to the outward man. Even, when exerciſed about ſacred things, it hath that which is <hi>external</hi> for its <hi>immediate object.</hi> It removes external hindrances of ſpiritual exerciſes, and provides external opportunities and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations for the performance of them. If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates call a Synod, they do not properly call it as a <hi>court of Chriſt,</hi> or as <hi>miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> but as a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſubjects, whoſe joint deliberations are calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote the honour of God the King of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the happineſs of their country, by the right government of the church. If a magiſtrate command perſons to compear before a church-court to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or to bear witneſs, be commands them not as ſpiritual members of Chriſt's myſtical body, but as his own and Jehovah's ſubjects, to take their trial or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the truth before proper arbitrators of their cauſe, that God may be honoured, and through keeping of order in the church, the welfare of the city or nation may be advanced and conſirmed. If he puniſh inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contemners of the authority and cenſures of the

            <p n="3">3. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in their TORM. Though magiſtrates be the <hi>miniſters of God</hi> for good to men, their power over their ſubjects is of a LORDLY nature. They are <hi>lordly</hi> fathers, who, by making and enforcing civil laws, can <hi>compel</hi> the diſobedient.—In this view, if they eſtabliſh any thing pertaining to the church, they eſtabliſh it as a mean of honouring God their Superior, in the advancement of the welfare of the common wealth. If they puniſh faults, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as <hi>crimes,</hi> injurious to the happineſs of the ſtate, diſhonouring God its ſupreme Governor, and provoking his wrath againſt it, and they puniſh thoſe crimes only on the outward man, by fining, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—But church power is altogether MINISTERIAL, diſtributing to men, reproofs, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and other ordinances, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired preſcriptions of Chriſt, Mat. xvi. 19. &amp; xviii. 18. 1 Cor. iv. 1, 2. Chriſt being her alone Lord, Church-rulers have no power to make any <hi>laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called,</hi> Iſa. xxxiii. 22 James iv. 12. In deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with offenders, they conſider faults, even oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, tyranny, ſinful wars and leagues, perverſion of judgment, bribery or the like in magiſtrates, who are members, not <hi>as crimes,</hi> but merely <hi>as ſcandals,</hi> deſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruining mens ſouls, plaguing the church, and diſhonouring and provoking Chriſt and his Father in

him, againſt it. They have no <hi>compulſory power,</hi>—can puniſh no man either in his perſon or his external property, can uſe no weapons but ſuch as are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> mighty through God; adminiſtring church cenſures, not as puniſhments, but as ſpiritual privileges, and divinely inſtituted means of bringing offenders to a thorough repentance of their ſins, to the eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls.—And this whole power muſt be uſed, only in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, as Head of his church, 2 Cor. i. 24. x 4, 5, 8. xiii. 8, 10. ii. 6,—10 1 Cor, v. 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in their PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER END. The <hi>formal end of magiſtratical power</hi> is to advance the glory of God, the King of nations, in promoting the welfare of the commonwealth;—and the eſtabliſhment of the true religion, and care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the proſperity and propagation of the church, are uſed as eminent means of gaining that end. Or, the good of the church may alſo be conſidered as an <hi>acceſſory end</hi> of civil adminiſtration, as the better civil juſtice be executed, open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Nay, though the advancement of the church's welfare be not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal end of magiſtracy, yet as Chriſt is made Head over all things to his church, every magiſtrate, who profeſſeth the Chriſtian religion, ought to purſue the formal end of his office, as ſubordinated to his <hi>Chriſtian end</hi> of promoting the glory of God in the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the church and eternal ſalvation of men—But the formal <hi>end</hi> of all church power is the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in Chriſt, by promoting the ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, converſion and edification of mens ſouls; and the welfare of nations is but an <hi>acceſſory</hi> or <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> end, at which church-rulers, as ſubjects in the ſtate, ought always to aim;—as the better they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and obtain the end of their office, the fewer will be the crimes, the better both ſubjects and magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, and the more numerous and valuable the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God on the nation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in their PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER EFFECTS. The <hi>proper effects</hi> of magiſtratical
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1285200500:68"/>
power, rightly exerciſed, is the good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in their commodious enjoyment of civil privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, in a manner mightily calculated to promote the honour of God, as the Moſt High over all the earth;—and the purity, peace and proſperity of the church, ariſing from the right adminiſtration of juſtice, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of evil doers, and praiſe of them that do well, is but an <hi>acceſſory effect.</hi> But the <hi>proper effect</hi> of church power rightly exerciſed, is the converſion of men to Jeſus Chriſt, fellowſhip with him, and growth in grace and good works, to the praiſe of his glory; and the advantage accruing to cities or nations, by the virtuous laws and fervent prayers of church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is but an <hi>acceſſory effect</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in their SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTS of reſidence. No eccleſiaſtical power can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in a heathen, a woman, or a child; and no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of juriſdiction in a ſingle perſon;—as civil power often may, or doth. Nor can one eccleſiaſtic officer delegate his power to another.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They differ in their FORMAL CONSIDERATION OF THE PERSONS UPON WHOM THEY ARE EXER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISED. A magiſtrate's power extends over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſident in his territory, be their moral character what it will, Jews, Heathens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. xiii 1. But church-power extends only to the profeſſed members of Chriſt's myſtical body, the Church, 1 Corinth. v. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Civil and eccleſiaſtical power differ in reſpect of their DIVIDED EXERCISE. The one may, and ought to be exerciſed, whether the other be ſo or not.—The <hi>end of church-cenſure</hi> being to gain ſinners to repentance and ſalvation, ſcandalous perſons appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penitent, ought to be ſeaſonably abſolved from it, and reſtored to communion with the church in ſealing ordinances. But the <hi>end of civil puniſhment</hi> being the ſatisfaction of the law, and the deterring of others from the like faults, criminals, however penitent and fully reſtored to church-fellowſhip, may, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their crime demands, be puniſhed, even unto death. And ſuppoſe a church-member ſhould have ſatisfied the demands of the civil law for a crime, he ought to be proſecuted and cenſured for it as a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1285200500:69"/>
by the eccleſiaſtical courts, till he appear duly penitent. Not only ought church-rulers to cenſure ſcandalous perſons, when magiſtrates take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their faults, but even to cenſure magiſtrates, who are church-members, for what wickedneſs they commit under colour of countenance from the civil law. And where magiſtrates puniſh, and church-rulers cenſure the ſame perſons for the ſame faults, the proceſſes ought to be kept entirely diſtinct from, and independent of each other;—though, to prevent unneceſſary ſwearing, the proof taken in one court may ſometimes be produced and judged of, alſo in the other.</p>

            <p>OBJECT. XXIV. <q rend="inline">"To allow magiſtrates a power of judging about the matters of religion will make them church-rulers."</q> ANSW. (1) No more than it made Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, and the king of Nineveh church-rulers. (2.) No more than church-rulers taking cognizance of murder, adultery, inceſt, theft, robbery, or even of the conduct of Chriſtian magiſtrates relative to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, wars, alliances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will make them magiſtrates.

Miniſters as the deputies of Chriſt, require magiſtrates to execute their office for the honour of Chriſt, and welfare of his church, and cenſure them, if church-members, if they do not. Magiſtrates as vicegerents of God, the King of nations, require mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters faithfully to execute their office, particularly as ſtated by the laws of the land, in order to promote virtue and happineſs among the ſubjects, and draw the bleſſing of God upon them; and they puniſh them <hi>as undutiful ſubjects,</hi> if they notoriouſly tranſgreſs, 1 Kings ii. 26. Magiſtrates have NO ECCLESIASTICAL POWER at all. They have no power to reſtrain or hinder the free and full exerciſe of church power. But, by giving full opportunity, encouragement and excitement to church officers, they have power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that church power be freely and faithfully exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in their dominions. They have no power to tranſact any thing eccleſiaſtical, as in admiſſion of members into the church, or to the ſeals of God's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;—no power to chooſe or ordain church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;—no power to preach the goſpel, diſpenſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, inflict cenſures, or abſolve from them.—They have no power to preſcribe or enact any eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical laws; but they have power to adopt ſuch law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and expedient conſtitutions, as have been made by the church-courts, into their civil code, by a legal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,—and power to enact ſuch <hi>political laws</hi> as are neceſſary for the more advantageous execution of theſe eccleſiaſtical conſtitutions. They have no power to frame a religion for their ſubjects, or ratify a falſe religion already received or framed, or to eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in religion, which is not founded in the word of God; but they have a power to adopt the law of
<pb facs="tcp:1285200500:72"/>
God, and the religion preſcribed by it, as a part of their civil law, in order to promote the glory of God in the welfare of the nation.—The more public church courts be, and the more extenſive his influence upon his ſubjects, and the welfare of the nation,—the more right hath the civil magiſtrate to exerciſe his <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical power</hi> about them. The church having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic right and power from Chriſt to call Synods for government, whenever her circumſtances require it, the magiſtrate hath no power to deprive her of this right. But while the church calls them as courts of Chriſt, conſtituted of church rulers appointed by him to act in his name, the magiſtrate may call them as courts eſtabliſhed by the civil law, and neceſſary to to promote the peace, order and piety, and ſo the proſperity of his ſubjects,—as courts, which conſiſt of his principal ſubjects, and to which place and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be given in his dominions. The magiſtrate hath no power of deputing to Synods ſuch members as he pleaſeth, Acts xv. 2 Chron. viii. 18. or, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or recal thoſe whom the church hath deputed, unleſs the ſafety of the ſtate plainly require it. But he may compel members, and parties who have cauſes before the court, to attend, if the caſe of the church require it, as a mean of repreſſing a malicious and turbulent faction, who have, or may hurt the State. It is not neceſſary, that either the magiſtrate, or his Commiſſioner, attend eccleſiaſtical Synods;—though to ſecure their protection, curb unruly troublers of the court, and to witneſs the propriety of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, he may attend.—If he attend, He hath a power to judge for himſelf, how matters are eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically tranſacted,—a power <hi>politically</hi> to provide, That the members meddle with no political affairs, which do not belong to them as a court of Chriſt:—and to take care, that members, and others preſent, obſerve that due decency, in reaſoning, voting, ſubmitting, or hearing, which the nature of the court requires. If any cauſe be partly civil and partly eccleſiaſtical, he is to judge the civil part himſelf, and leave the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical to the church court.—Even in eccleſiaſtical cauſes, he may give his advice, nay, he may propoſe and require Synods to examine and decide concerning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1285200500:73"/>
points of doctrine or practice, if neceſſary for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his own conſcience, or the inſtruction and edification of his ſubjects, in order to promote the welfare of the ſtate, in ſubordination to the glory of God. But he hath no power to hinder others to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their difficulties or grievances before the Synod for ſatisfaction or redreſs, unleſs the cauſe be partly of a political nature, a Synodical deciſion of which, at that time, endangers the ſtate.—He hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to preſide in the Synod, or give his deciſive vote in any of their tranſactions. But, as a man and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, he hath right to a <hi>judgment of diſcretion,</hi> Whether their deciſions be according to the law of God or not,—and as a magiſtrate, he hath a power of <hi>political judgment,</hi> by which he doth not properly judge, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe deciſions be true or falſe, good or bad in themſelves, but Whether, and How far, they ought to be ratified, and as it were adopted into the laws of the State, and connected with civil rewards, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or puniſhments. Thus, the power of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, <hi>in nothing</hi> interferes with the power of the Synod. Nothing is done by the one, as a magiſtrate, that the other can do, as a court of Chriſt. And as the deciſions of Synods are <hi>ſupreme in the eccleſiaſtic order,</hi> from which there is no appeal but to Jeſus Chriſt;—By remonſtrating as a church-member, and commanding them as their King, the magiſtrate may cauſe the Synod re-conſider its own deeds, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reverſe them himſelf;—ſo the magiſtrate's deed concerning the civil ratification of church-deeds is <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in its kind,</hi> from which there is no appeal but to God himſelf. The Synod may require him as a Church-member; and, as ſubjects, they may remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and ſupplicate his re-conſideration of his own deed, but they cannot reverſe it themſelves.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XXV. <q rend="inline">"To allow magiſtrates to judge in matters of religion for others, and to reſtrain and puniſh corruptions in it, is to render them Lords of mens faith and conſcience,—a power which even the inſpired apoſtles diſclaimed. For if magiſtrates impoſe any religion at all upon their ſubjects, it muſt be what their own conſcience dictates; and then what ſhall become of the private rights of conſcience, among
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1285200500:74"/>
their ſubjects?"</q> ANSW. (1.) Did then God, who of old commanded magiſtrates to judge about matters of religion, and to reſtrain and puniſh blaſphemers, idolaters, ſeducers, profaners of the Sabbath, Deut. xiii. 9, 10. &amp; xvii. 5,—7. Lev. xxiv. 11,—14. Song ii. 15. Num. xv. 32,—36. command them to lord it over mens conſcience? If it was not ſo then, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo now, as conſcience, tyranny and murder, are the ſame in every age. (2) The objection ſtrikes with equal force, againſt all eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true religion, and againſt all creeds and Confeſſions of Faith, and againſt all eccleſiaſtical judging and cenſuring of men for hereſy, blaſphemy, or idolatry, contrary to Rev. ii. 20. Titus iii 10. Gal. v. 10, 11. as againſt magiſtrates judging about eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing religion or puniſhing the public inſulters of it. (3.) Magiſtrates act in this matter as <hi>his miniſters</hi> and vicegerents, by virtue of his commandment, who is the alone Lord of conſcience, and reſtrain or puniſh nothing, but what men, under any proper influence of faith and conſcience, would abſtain from, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Lord of conſcience, who is to be their future judge, and hath appointed magiſtrates, as his ſubſtitutes to avenge the open injuries done to him in this world, Rom. xiii. 4. And, if men perſiſt in ſins plainly forbidden in his law, he holds them as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners againſt, and condemned by their conſcience, Tit. iii. 10, 11. (4) The abſurdity of mens conſciences being ſuſtained as a ſtandard, as well as the proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of magiſtrates making laws relative to religion, have been already manifeſted. Magiſtrates conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have no more juſt claim to God bead than thoſe of their meaneſt ſubjects. Not, therefore, magiſtrates pretences to conſcience, but plain and evident marks of the authority of God manifeſted in, and from the ſcriptures, muſt determine their ſubjects to receive a religion in obedience to their authority, as ſubordinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the authority of God, the Moſt High, ſuperior of both.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XXVI. <q rend="inline">"In Rom. xiii. where the power of magiſtrates is more fully deſcribed than any where elſe in the New Teſtament, only the commands of the

ſecond table of the moral law are ſubjoined, to mark that it only extends to the concerns of men one with another."</q> ANSW. (1.) Who authorized the objector to put aſunder the two Teſtaments and the two tables which God hath joined? Or, to ſeparate the firſt part of that chapter from the laſt, which certainly relates to religion, any more than from verſe 9th. (2.) The magiſtrate's character, <hi>miniſter of God for good, terror</hi> to, and <hi>revenger of evil doers,</hi> and his duty to love his neighbours as himſelf there hinted, cannot admit of his having no care about religion and the firſt table of the moral law. (3) To oblige men carefully to ſearch the whole ſcriptures, God hath ſeldom, if ever, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his whole will, relative to any thing, in one paſſage.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XXVII. <q rend="inline">"If we allow magiſtrates any power at all about religious matters, we muſt plunge ourſelves into inextricable difficulties, as the preciſe limits of civil and eccleſiaſtical power can never be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—and every ſmall miſtake in religious opinions, or neglect of religious duties, muſt bring men to the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, as theft draws down the wrath of God on nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as blaſphemy and idolatry do"</q> ANSW. There is no more difficulty in limiting the power of magiſtrates about either religion or virtue, than in fixing preciſe limits to the power of church-rulers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to thoſe matters. Do you fix preciſe limits to church-power according to the word of God, and I ſhall next moment fix as preciſe limits for the power of the magiſtrate. If you limit the exerciſe of church power to duties required, and ſins forbidden in the firſt table of the moral law,—you naturally leave the care of the duties required in the ſecond table to the magiſtrate. But then, whether a church of Chriſt, having no care or power about morality toward men,—or a deputed kingdom of God without any care or power about any thing relating to the honour of God, be moſt abſurd and deviliſh, I know not. If you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, That the power of church-rulers extends to the external obedience or diſobedience of church-members to both tables of God's law, not as <hi>civil,</hi> but as <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> conduct, tending to the ſpiritual advantage or hurt of the church, and therefore connected with the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1285200500:76"/>
ſpiritual encouragements or frowns of Chriſt's viſible church; and that they meddle not with ſins againſt the ſecond table <hi>as crimes</hi> againſt mens perſon or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but <hi>as ſcandals</hi> againſt the ſpiritual edification of the church, and the glory of Jeſus Chriſt therein concerned;—I immediately reply, That preciſely, in like manner, the power of magiſtrates extends to the external obedience or diſobedience of <hi>civil ſubjects as ſuch,</hi> to both tables of God's law, <hi>not as it is of a ſpiritual nature,</hi> but <hi>as it affects the civil welfare or hurt of the nation,</hi> or honour of God as the King of it, and ſo ought to ſtand connected with civil encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements or diſcouragements. If you pretend, that it will be ſtill hard to ſhew, how far magiſtrates may, in that view, proceed in matters of the firſt table, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with reſpect to offending clergymen I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is not one whit harder, than to ſhew how far church courts may proceed in matters of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, particularly with reſpect to offenſive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical adminiſtrations. (2.) Your pretence, that if magiſtrates puniſh any faults in religion, they muſt puniſh all known faults in the ſame form and degree, is but a deceitful inſult on the Moſt High, who, in his word, appointed the capital puniſhment of idolaters and blaſphemers, and yet never warranted the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many faults relative to religion, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; nay, for ought I ſee, hath not required magiſtrates at all to puniſh any thing but the moſt atrocious faults in it.

XXXV. <q rend="inline">"The annexing of temporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to the profeſſion and practice of the Chriſtian religion or external diſcouragements to the profeſſion or practice of ſuch opinions and worſhip as are contrary to it,—tends to render men hypocrites, and their religion merely carnal, in obedience to civil authority, and influenced by mere carnal motives.

(1) God, who well knows the true nature of religious worſhip and obedience, and highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the candor and purity of conſcience, excited the Iſraelites to it, partly by external encouragements, reſtraints and terrors, Deut. iv,—viii, xxvii,—xxxii, Lev. xviii,—xx, xxvi. and by each of his prophets. Iſa. i.—to Mal. iv. And even under the goſpel, godlineſs hath the <hi>promiſes of this life,</hi> as well as of that which is to come, 1 Tim iv. 8. 1 Pet. iii. 13.—Did you mean to blaſpheme his conduct as abſolutely deviliſh? (2.) With God's approbation, David, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah and others, by familiar intimacy, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to poſts of honour, encouraged ſuch as appeared eminent in the profeſſion and practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion; and they excluded ſuch as appeared notoriouſly wicked, Pſal. cxix. 63. &amp; ci. 6, 7. Neh. vii 2. &amp; xiii, 28. Nay, David before hand publicly intimated his reſolution to prefer only pious and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men.—And why not, when ſuch bid faireſt to be eminently uſeful officers in the ſtate? (3.) Why may not men, even by external advantages be encouraged to an external attendance upon goſpel-ordinances, which, by the bleſſing of God and the working of his Spirit, may iſſue in rendering them eminently uſeful ſubjects, and in their eternal ſalvation, even as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be hired to that reading of their Bible and learning of their Catechiſm, which may iſſue in their converſion and everlaſting life? (4) Regard to the command of parents, maſters, magiſtrates, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, all at once, in our religious profeſſion and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is no way inconſiſtent with, but may be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubordinated to a ſupreme regard to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of God in them. (5.) Do you really think, that thoſe, who believe neither a God, nor a heaven, nor a hell, ought under pretence of civil right, to be as readily admitted to places of power and truſt, in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil governments as the moſt pious?—Nay, are not even a profeſſion and practice of the Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much more profitable in a nation, than open blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, impiety and idolatry, which we have heard from God's own word, exceedingly corrupt mens mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and pull down the wrath of God on the ſociety. (6.) If ſuch things only be reſtrained and puniſhed, as are plainly contrary to the law of God, and a right conſcience, and never puniſhed, till after ſufficient means of conviction have been afforded and trampled on, how can that make men diſſemble with or ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their conſcience, any more than the puniſhment of theft, murder, inceſt, or the like, can do it?</p>
            <p>OBJECT.

It would effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally root out Popery and every thing ſimilar."</q> ANSW. (1.) Juſt as remarkable a tendency, as the leaving of children to themſelves hath to render them truly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and a diſtinguiſhed honour to their parents, Prov. xxv. 15. 1 Sam. iii. 13.—as remarkable a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency as the aboliſhment of all eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it would have to render men perfect ſaints. (2.) It is plain, that God, when he fixed a civil eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of revealed religion, and when he repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as above, hereſy, blaſphemy, and idolatry, as reudering men monſters of all manner of wickedneſs, inſtead of <hi>good ſubjects,</hi> neighbours, or Chriſtians, thought otherwiſe.

Never, that I know of, was there a nation or nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſociety on earth in which there was leſs of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhment, good or bad, than among the Iſmaelians of Irak and Syria, and the Giagas of Africa. What were the noted virtues which flouriſhed among them? Murders, aſſaſſinations, which cannot be read or heard, without horror. Under the protection of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1285200500:89"/>
an extenſive toleration, how did England, about an hundred and thirty years ago, ſwarm with Sectarian errors, blaſphemies, confuſions? And, what hath eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the peace of the State, or the orthodoxy and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our church gained by our laſt Scotch tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Repeated attempts in 1715 and 1745, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge our civil eſtabliſhment and dethrone our lawful Sovereigns in favours of Popiſh pretenders, are the noted advantages, which have accrued to our State, and an alarming increaſe of infidelity, profaneneſs, and Popery, to our church. Inſtead of ſcarce ſix hundred Papiſts, which was once all that could be reckoned in Scotland, their number now, may amount to about thirty thouſand. In about a dozen of pariſhes in the North, they have above twenty congregations, ſeveral of them pretty large, and a College and an Academy for training up prieſts. How quickly theſe, with the Scotch colleges abroad, may furniſh converters for the whole nation, God only knows. In the pariſh of South Uiſt, there are 2300 Papiſts and 300 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; in Barra 1250 Papiſts, and 50 Proteſtants; in Ardnamurchan 1950 Papiſts, and 17 Proteſtants; in Kinkmichael and its neighbouring pariſh 1520 Papiſts; in Kilmanivaig 1600; and in Glenelg 1340.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. XXXVII. <q rend="inline">"All civil laws eſtabliſhing revealed religion muſt neceſſarily land magiſtrates in <hi>perſecuting</hi> their ſubjects; for, if theſe civil laws be contemned and violated, the breakers muſt be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed"</q> ANSW. For this reaſon no ſuperior, parent, maſter, miniſter, or magiſtrate, muſt make any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment relative to religious matters, becauſe, if it be diſregarded, puniſhment or cenſure muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and that will amount to perſecution in the ſenſe of the objection.—No duty muſt ever be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, leſt ſome perplexing conſequence ſhould attend it.

Puniſhment of men for what is plainly contrary to the word of God is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for conſcience ſake, but a proper correction of them for trampling on and murdering their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

(3.) If, by the bleſſing of God, parents can do much to advance religion in their families, without any furious or hurtful beating of their children,—and miniſters do much to promote it in their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without proceeding, perhaps once in their life, to the higher excommunication; and if both may do much to render their children and people uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the commonwealth, without having power to fine, impriſon or kill them, why may not magiſtrates by their appointments, encouragements, and example, much promote the profeſſion and practice of revealed religion, without proceeding, unleſs very rarely, to any diſagreeable ſeverities?—The point we attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted directly to eſtabliſh is, that <hi>magiſtrates ought never to grant an authoritative toleration to groſs hereſy, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, idolatry;</hi> you therefore act uncandidly in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually haling in the affair of puniſhments; even capital ones, juſt as your tolerant friends the antient Remonſtrants perpetually haled in the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, in order to render the ſovereignty of God's grace odious to the people. (4) If magiſtrates take heed never to puniſh on the head of religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but when the CRIME is plainly relevant and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeſt, plainly contrary to the laws of God, as well as to thoſe of the land; and that the puniſhment be SUITABLE and SEASONABLE, circumſtantially calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to promote the real welfare of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, why ſhould they be charged with perſecution, for prudently ſupporting their moſt important laws, and yet held innocent, if not virtuous, in ſupporting their comparatively inſignificant laws, relative to fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fowling, hunting, or the like?</p>

Let the whole adminiſtration of government in church and ſtate, and ſubjection to it, be regulated by the law of God.—Let every prudent and winning method be taken to promote an univerſally chearful compliance.—If any continue to diſſent, let <hi>every degree and form of tender forbearance</hi> be exerciſed towards them, which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs laws of God will permit, eſpecially, if by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect life, they manifeſt themſelves perſons of a truly tender conſcience, with reſpect to what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.—If all will not concur in theſe meaſures, let particular perſons, in their ſeveral ſtations, act as becometh the goſpel of Chriſt, obeying God rather than man, and doing all that he hath commanded, without turning aſide to the right-hand or to the left. And if need be, let them take up their croſs, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently follow Chriſt counting nothing too dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, if they may uprightly finiſh their courſe with joy—Upon trial, it would be found as eaſy for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to rectify the diſorders in their department, relative to religion, as it would be for church-rulers in Britain, to rectify what pertains to rheirs, in which, you juſt now pled, that there never ſhould be any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration at all.</p>

Being treacherouſly and cruelly oppoſed in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion, by their two Popiſh Queens, the Proteſtant Lords and others in Scotland, entered into five ſeveral bonds, A. D. 1557, 1559, 1560, 1563, in which they ſolemnly engaged to aſſiſt and protect each other, in promoting the free exerciſe of the Proteſtant religion. It was only the ſmaller part of the Proteſtants in our land, which entered into theſe bonds,—nor doth it appear, they were intended as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral obligations.—But, when the Papiſts abroad were labouring, with all their might, to extirpate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion; and the Pope was found to have granted diſpenſations for qualifying his votaries, to undermine it in our land,—the <hi>National Covenant</hi> was formed and ſworn in 1581—in order to fruſtrate their attempts, and ſecure the reformation attained. In it the abominations of Popery were expreſly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly abjured; and it was underſtood as adhered to and renewed in every religious bond that ſollowed. After God had marvellouſly fruſtrated the attempts of the Spaniards and other Papiſts againſt Britain, our fathers, in thankfulneſs to Him,—and to ſecure themſelves againſt the Popiſh confederates abroad, and their friends at home,—with much unanimity and joy renewed their <hi>National Covenant,</hi> A.

Charles had ſcarce granted a peace, a kind of eſtabliſhment of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the murderous Papiſts in Ireland; and Duke Hamilton's attempts to reſtore him to his throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any ſecurity for religion or liberty miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in England, when the Scots, and not a few of the Iriſh renewed their Covenant, with a ſolemn acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſins and engagement to duties.—To manifeſt the fearful perfidy of all <hi>authoritative tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of groſs hereſy, blaſphemy, idolatry, Popery, and every other form of encouragement to, or recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, the <hi>ſolemn,</hi> the <hi>religious</hi> nature of theſe covenants, and their <hi>extenſive</hi> and <hi>perpetual obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> muſt be conſidered.</p>
            <p>God alone bath a ſupreme and unlimited authority and right to regulate his own, and the conduct of all his creatures, Pſal. lxxxiii. 18. Dan. iv. 35. James iv. 12. But the very conſtitution of a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, implies a power derived from him to govern it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even as mens ſtanding in the relation of parents, maſters, magiſtrates, or church-rulers, neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies their power to govern others,—<hi>in ſubordination to him.</hi> By virtue of their divinely originated authority over others, parents, maſters, and other rulers make laws, or binding rules, for directing the external be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of thoſe who are committed to their charge. And by their authority derived from God to <hi>rule their own</hi> Spirit, and to <hi>govern</hi> and <hi>keep in ſubjection their whole body,</hi> Prov. xvi. 32. James iii. 2. 1 Cor. ix. 27. all men are empowered to make for themſelves laws of ſelf engagement, in promiſes, oaths, vows and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, which extend to their purpoſes and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as to their external acts. And, as all the authority, which men have over themſelves or others, is derived ſrom that ſupreme and independent autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is in God himſelf, and is communicated
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1285200500:98"/>
to them, by an act of his will, and is implied in his giving them ſuch a nature and ſtation, it is plain, that no human laws of authority, or ſelf-engagement, can have any obligation or binding force, but what are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by and ſubordinated to the divine laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or revelation, 2 Cor. xiii. 8. and that, if ſuch laws and engagements be lawful, God, not only doth, but muſt neceſſarily ratify them, his law requiring the fulſilment of them, under pain of his higheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, Rom. xiii. 1,—6. Mat. v. 33.</p>
            <p>As no <hi>deputed authority</hi> derived from God, can increaſe that ſupreme, that infinite authority, which he hath in himſelf; ſo no human command or engagement can increaſe that infinite obligation to duty, which his law hath <hi>in itſelf.</hi> But, if lawful, they have in them a <hi>real obligation, diſtinct,</hi> though neither <hi>ſeparated</hi> nor <hi>ſeparable,</hi> from the obligation of God's law. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Bellarmine and other Papiſts, that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or vows do not bind us <hi>in moral duties</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the law of God, is manifeſtly abſurd. It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infers, that all human commands of ſuperiors as well as human promiſes, oaths, vows, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, are in themſelves deſtitute of <hi>all binding force,</hi> except in ſo far as they relate to ſuch trifling things, as the law of God doth not require of men in ſuch particular truths; and thus ſaps the foundation of all relative order and mutual truſt and confidence among mankind. Commands of ſuperiors muſt be <hi>mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi> of the will of God in his law, and promiſes, oaths, vows and covenants muſt be nothing but <hi>mere acknowledgments,</hi> that God's law requires ſuch things from us,—in ſo far as relating to moral duties. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the authority which God hath in himſelf, and with which he hath inveſted men, as his deputies, as ſo inconſiſtent and mutually deſtructive of each other, that men cannot be bound to the ſame thing by both. It repreſents the law of God as neceſſarily deſtructive of the being of an ordinance appointed by itſelf, to promote the more exact obſervance of itſelf,—in ſo far as that ordinance binds to a conſcientious and diligent obedience to it. It is contrary to the common ſenſe of mankind in every age, who have all along conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

ISSAR, <hi>a very faſt and ſtrait binding bond</hi> or <hi>obligation,</hi>—as <hi>our own bond,</hi> that ſtands upon or againſt us, Num. xxx. 2,—12.—<hi>Self-binding, ſelf engagements,</hi> is ſo much the <hi>eſſential form</hi> of vows, and of all covenants, promiſes, or promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory oaths, whether of God or man, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt at all, or even be conceived of without it, any more than a man without a ſoul, or an angel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an underſtanding and will. To repreſent vowing as a <hi>placing of ourſelves more directly under the law of God,</hi> or any command of it; or, as a <hi>placing of ourſelves in ſome new relation to the law,</hi> is but an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to render unintelligible that which the Holy Ghoſt hath, in the above-mentioned chapter, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make plain, if it doth not alſo import, that we can place ourſelves <hi>more directly</hi> under the moral law than God hath or can place us, or, more directly than Chriſt was placed.—To pretend, that mens commands or engagements derive their whole obligation from the <hi>law of God's requiring</hi> us to <hi>obey</hi> the one,—and <hi>pay,</hi> or <hi>fulfil</hi> or <hi>perform</hi> the other, is no leſs abſurd.—Theſe divine commands, requiring us to obey, pay, perform or fulfil human laws and engagements, <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe</hi> an <hi>intrinfic</hi> obligation, in theſe laws and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and powerfully enforce it.

an engagement which hath no obligation in itſelf, any more than the laws of Britain can oblige me to PAY a Bill, or FULFIL a Bond conſiſting of nothing but mere cyphers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>intrinſic obligation</hi> of promiſes, oaths, vows, and covenants which conſtitutes their very eſſence or eſſential form, is totally and manifeſtly diſtinct from the obligation of the law of God in many reſpects. (1.) In his law, God, by the declaration of his will, as our ſupreme Ruler, binds us, Deut. xii. 32. In promiſes, vows, covenants, and promiſſory oaths, we, as his deputy-governors over ourſelves, by a declaration of our will, <hi>bind ourſelves with a bond, bind our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uls with our own bond, our own vow,</hi> Num, xxx. Pſalm lxvi. 13, 15 &amp; cxix. 106, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) The obligation of our promiſes, oaths and covenants is alway ſubject to examination by the ſtandard of God's law, as to both its matter and manner, 1 Theſſ. v. 21. But it would be preſumption, blaſphemous preſumption, to examine, Whether, what we know to be the law of God be right and obligatory, or not, James iv. 11, 12. Iſa. viii. 20. Deut. v. 32. (3.) The law of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily binds all men to the <hi>moſt abſolute perfection in holineſs,</hi> be they as incapable of it as they will, Matth. v. 48. 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. No man can, without mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tempting of God, bind himſelf by vow or oath to any thing, but what he is able to perform. No man may vow to do any thing which is not in his own power, and for the performance of which he hath no promiſe of ability from God. But, no mere man ſince the fall is able, in this life either in himſelf or by any grace received from God, <hi>perfectly</hi> to keep the commandments of God, Eccl. vii. 20 James iii. 2. While God remains God, his law can demand no leſs than abſolute perfection in holineſs. While his word remains true, no mere man ſince the fall, in this life, can poſſibly attain to it; and therefore ought never to promiſe or vow it. The leaſt imperfection in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however involuntary, breaks the law of God, and is even contrary to the duty of our relative ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of huſhands, parents, maſters, magiſtrates, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, wives, children, ſervants or people, 1 John iii. 4. Rom. vii. 14, 23, 24. But it is only by that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1285200500:101"/>
which is, in ſome reſpect, <hi>voluntary ſinfulneſs,</hi> that we break our lawful vows, Pſal. xliv. 47. Nothing can more clearly mark the diſtinction of the two obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than this particular. There is no evading the force of it, but either by adopting the Arminian <hi>new law</hi> of ſincere obedience, or by adopting the Popiſh perfection of ſaints in this life. (4.) The law of God binds <hi>all men for ever,</hi> whether in heaven or hell, Pſal. iii. 7, 8. No human law or ſelf-engagement binds men, but <hi>only in this life,</hi> in which they remain imperfect, and are encompaſſed with temptations to ſeduce them from their duty. In heaven they have no need of ſuch helps to duty, and in hell they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be profited by them.</p>
            <p>The obligation of lawful promiſes, oaths, vows and covenants, as well as of human laws, reſpecting moral duties, however <hi>diſtinct,</hi> is no more ſeparable from the obligation of God's law, than Chriſt's <hi>two diſtinct natures</hi> are ſeparable, the one from the other, but cloſely connected in manifold reſpects. In binding ourſelves to neceſſary duties, and to other things ſo long and ſo far as is conducive thereto, God's law as the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy him, is made the rule of our engagement. Our vow is no <hi>new rule</hi> of duty, but a <hi>new</hi> bond to make the law of God <hi>our rule.</hi> Even Adam's engagement to perfect obedience in the covenant of works was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſe. His ſallibility in his eſtate of innocence, made it proper, that he ſhould be bound by his own conſent or engagement, as well as by the authority of God. Our imperfection in this life, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which ſurround us, make it needful, that we, in like manner, ſhould be bound to the ſame rule, both by the authority of God, and our own engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is in the law of God, that all our deputed authority to command others, or to bind ourſelves is allotted to us. The requirement of moral duties by the law of God obligeth us to uſe all lawful means to promote the performance of them; and hence requires human laws and ſelf-engagements, and the obſervance of them as conducive to it. Nay they are alſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required in his law, as his ordinances for helping and hedging us in to our duty. In making lawful
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1285200500:102"/>
vows, as well as in making human laws, we exert the <hi>deputed authority</hi> of God, <hi>the ſupreme Lawgiver,</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in his law, in the manner which his law preſcribes, and in obedience to its preſcription. In forming our vows as an inſtituted ordinance of God's worſhip, which he hath required us to receive, obſerve, and keep pure and entire, Pſal. lxxvi. 11. &amp; cxix. 106. &amp; lvi. 12. Iſa. xix. 18, 21. &amp; xlv. 23, 24. &amp; xliv. 5. Jer. l. 5. 2 Cor. viii. 5.—we act preciſely according to the direction of his law, and in obedience to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it,—<hi>binding ourſelves with a bond, binding our ſoul with a bond,</hi> Num. xxx. 2,—11.—<hi>binding our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that which we utter with our lips,</hi> ver. 2, 6, 12.—<hi>binding ourſelves with a binding oath,—binding our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves—binding our ſoul by our own vow—our own bond,</hi> ver. 4, 7, 14. In forming our vow, we, according to the preſcription of his own law, ſolemnly conſtitute God, who is the ſupreme Lawgiver and Lord of the conſcience,—the witneſs of our ſelf-engagement, and the Guarantee, graciouſly to reward our evangelical fulfilment of it, and juſtly to puniſh our perfidious violation of it. The more punctual and faithful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of God's law, notwithſtanding our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold infirmities and temptations, and the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual promoting of his glory therein, is the END of our ſelf-engagements, as well as of human laws of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And by a due regard to their binding force, as above ſtated, is this end promoted,—as hereby the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of God's law is the more deeply impreſſed on our minds, and we are ſhut up to obedience to it, and deterred from tranſgreſſing it—In conſequence of our formation of our vow, with reſpect to its matter, manner, and end, as preſcribed by God, He doth, and neceſſarily muſt ratify it in all its awful ſolemnities, requiring us by his law, to <hi>pay</hi> it as a bond of <hi>debt,</hi>—to <hi>perform</hi> and <hi>fulfill</hi> it as an engagement to duties, and an <hi>obligation</hi> which <hi>ſtands upon</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> us, Num. xxx. 5, 7, 9, 11. with Deut. xxiii. 21,—23. Pſalm lxxvi. 11. &amp; l. 14. Eccl. v. 4, 5. Mat. v. 33. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to this divine requirement, and conſidering our vow, in that preciſe form, in which God in his law, adopts and ratifies it, and requires it to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1285200500:103"/>
We pay, perform, and fulfil it <hi>as a bond,</hi> wherewith we, in obedience to Him, <hi>have bound ourſelves,</hi> to endeavour univerſal obedience to his law, as our only rule of faith and manners. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth not, in his attempts to obey human laws or to fulfil ſelf-enagements, conſider them as having that binding force which the law of God allows them, he pours contempt on them, as ordinances of God, and on the law of God for allowing them a <hi>binding force.</hi> Thus, through maintaining the <hi>ſuperadded</hi> but <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> obligation of human laws, and of ſelf-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to moral duties, we do not make void, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh the obligation of God's law.</p>
            <p>The obligation of a vow, by which we engage our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to neceſſary duties commanded by the law of God, muſt therefore be INEXPRESSIBLY SOLEMN. Not only are we required by the law of God before our vow was made; but we are bound, in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, to fulfil our vow, as an engagement or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation founded in the ſupreme authority of his law warranting us to make it. We are bound to fulfil it as a <hi>mean of further impreſſing</hi> his authority manifeſted in his law, upon our own conſciences,—as a bond ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and promoting a faithful obedience to all his commandments We are bound to fulfil it, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that divine authority, by derived power from which, we as governors of ourſelves made it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his honour. In thoſe or like reſpects, our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of our vows is a direct obedience to his whole law.—We are moreover bound to fulfil it, as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ordinance of God's worſhip, the eſſential form of which lies in <hi>ſelf-obligation,</hi> and muſt be received, obſerved, kept pure and entire, and holily and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uſed, and ſo in obedience to Command I. II. III. We are bound to fulfil it, as an ordinance of God, in which we have <hi>pledged our own truth, ſincerity and faithfulneſs;</hi> and ſo in obedience to Command IX. I. II. III. We are bound to fulfil it, as a ſolemn deed or grant, in which we have made over our perſons, property, and ſervice to the Lord and his church; and ſo in obedience to Command I. II. VIII. nay, in obedience to the whole law of love and equity, Mat. xxii. 37, 39. &amp; vii. 12. We are bound to fulfil it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1285200500:104"/>
from regard to the declarative glory of God, as the witneſs of our making of it, that he may appear to have been called to atteſt nothing, but ſincerity and truth; and ſo in obedience to Command I. III. IX. We are bound to fulſil it from a regard to <hi>truth, honeſty,</hi> and <hi>reverence of God,</hi> as things not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his law, but good in themſelves, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his very nature, and therefore neceſſarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him,—and from a deteſtation of falſehood, injuſtice, and contempt of God, as things intrinſically evil, contrary to his nature, and therefore neceſſarily forbidden in his law; and thus in regard to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his whole law, as neceſſarily holy, juſt and good We are bound to fulfil it, from a regard to the holineſs, juſtice, faithfulneſs, majeſty, and other perfections of God, as the Guarantee of it, into whoſe hand we have committed the determination and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of its awful ſanction,—as the gracious rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our fidelity, or juſt revenger of our perfidy,—and hence in regard to our own happineſs, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that ſanction—In fine, We are bound to fulfil it in obedience to that command of God, which adopts and ratifies it, requiring us to <hi>pay, fulfil,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> our vow, oath or covenant, Pſal. l. 14. &amp; lxxvi. 11. Eccl. v. 4. Deut. xxiii. 21,—23 Mat. v. 33.</p>
            <p>In VIOLATING ſuch a vow, We do not merely tranſgreſs the law of God, as requiring the duties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, before the vow was made. But we alſo rebel againſt, and profane that divine warrant which we had to make our vow. We profane that authority over ourſelves in the exerciſe of which we made the vow, and conſequentially that ſupreme authority in God, from which ours was derived; and ſo ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the foundation of the whole law. We mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a contempt of that law, which regulated the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner of our vow. We profane the vow, as an ordinance of God's worſhip, appointed in his law. By trampling on a noted mean of promoting obedience to all the commands of God, We mark our hatred of them, and prepare ourſelves to tranſgreſs them, and endeavour to remove the awe of God's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and terror of his judgments from our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We blaſphemouſly repreſent the Moſt High as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1285200500:105"/>
a willing Witneſs to our treachery and fraud. We pour contempt on him, as the Guarantee of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, as if he inclined not, or durſt not avenge our villainy. Contrary to the truth and faithfulneſs required in his law, and pledged in our vow, we plunge ourſelves into the moſt criminal deceit and falſehood. Contrary to equity, we rob God and his church of that which we had ſolemnly devoted to their ſervice. Contrary to devotion, we baniſh the ſerious impreſſion of God's adorable perfections. Contrary to good neighbourhood, we render ourſelves a plague and curſe, and encourage others to the moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wickedneſs. Contrary to the deſign of our creation and preſervation, we reject the glory of God, and obedience to his law from being our end. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, we trample on the ratification of our vow, by the divine law in all its awful ſolemnities, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold connections with itſelf,—and requirement to pay it.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt, that our covenanting anceſtors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their vows in the manner above repreſented. They never repreſent them as <hi>mere acknowledgments</hi> of the obligation of God's law, or as placing themſelves in <hi>ſome new relation to God's law,</hi> or <hi>more directly under</hi> any command of it. But declare that a man <hi>binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> by a promiſſory oath to what is good and juſt—It cannot oblige to ſin: but in any thing not ſinful, being taken, it binds to performance.—By a vow <hi>we more ſtrictly bind ourſelves to neceſſary duties</hi>

But at the ſame time, they covenanted with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as church-members, in ſubordination to their covenanting with God himſelf as their principal party.—The ratifications given to theſe covenants by the State were really <hi>civil ratifications,</hi> which adopted them as a part of the laws of the State.—But that no more rendered them <hi>merely civil</hi> covenants, than the civil ratifications given to, and embodying our Confeſſions of Faith, made them <hi>merely civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</hi> and mere acts of Parliament,—or than the repeated legal eſtabliſhment of our Proteſtant religion in doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline and government, made it a mere <hi>civil religion.</hi> Theſe covenants were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed as means of promoting civil purpoſes. But that will no more prove them merely civil, than the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1285200500:107"/>
uſe of faſting and prayer for advancing or ſecuring the welfare of the State, will prove them a <hi>mere civil worſhipping of God.</hi>—Theſe covenants were formed for promoting the happineſs of both church and ſtate, and were calculated to anſwer that end. But ſo is the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion and all the ordinances of it, if duly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 1 Tim. i. 8. Prov. xiv. 34. I admit, that there was ſometimes too mixed an interference of civil and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power in enjoining theſe covenants. But abuſe of things doth not alter their nature. God's ordinances are too often uſed in a carnal, ſenſual and deviliſh manner, without ever being rendered ſuch themſelves. It is only, as <hi>really religious covenants,</hi> and not as <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>ſtate covenants,</hi> they can be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ordination vows or baptiſmal engagements.

As Chriſtians, and not merely as civil lords, they bound themſelves,—chiefly to promote the true religion according to God's word.—Had K. James been not only the original adviſer, but even the framer of the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> it might nevertheleſs have been a religious bond. The pſalms which K.

It is not improbable, that the miniſters of the church had a principal hand in the origination of our national covenant. In 1580, James was about fourteen years of age, and by no tranſcendent genius, qualified for the work. Juſt before, and quickly after, we find him marking his hatred of true reformation. His ruling favourites were not a little ſuſpected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, by the zealous clergy, as addicted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.—Through the tearing out of the minutes of four ſeſſions of the Aſſembly, October 1580, by ſome paraſite of the court, Calderwood's hiſtory, at leaſt his printed abridgment, is imperfect on this period. He only ſays, that <q rend="inline">"the ſecond Confeſſion of Faith, i. e. <hi>national covenant,</hi> commonly called the King's Confeſſion, was ſubſcribed by the King and his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, i. e. <hi>privy council,</hi> January 28th, 158<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The origination of the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was equally conſiſtent with a <hi>religious vow.</hi> Not a few of the moſt pious clergymen in England had all along, from Elizabeth's eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant religion, hated part of the ceremonies, and the lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of the biſhops. Many of theſe, driven from their charge, by the Prelatical perſecution, under Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth and James, and Charles I had been compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately taken into the families of great men, for the education of their children. Their inſtruction and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample were remarkably bleſſed, for rendering their pupils and others intelligent and pious. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the encroachments made upon their religion and liberties by Abp. Laud and his aſſiſtants, and not a few of them conceived a ſtrong reliſh for what was then called Puritaniſm. The ſucceſs of the Scotch covenanters, in their ſtruggles with the tyrannical court, made many of the Engliſh wiſh and hope for a ſimilar deliverance. In their treaty with Charles 1641, the Scots requeſted, that the Engliſh ſhould be brought to a reformed uniformity with themſelves in religion. The Scotch miniſters, who attended their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at London, in forming that treaty of peace, by their inſtructions and example, recommended their Preſbyterian reformation not a little to many of the moſt learned and pious of the Engliſh. A correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for promoting a religious uniformity between the two churches was carried on by a number of the Engliſh clergymen with the Scotch Aſſemblies, 1641, 1642, 1643; and by the Engliſh parliament with the Aſſemblies, 1642, 1643.

            <p>OBJECT. II. <q rend="inline">"In 1638, and 1643, they framed their covenants to admit Epiſcopalians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, whom they would not have admitted to the ſacraments."</q> ANSW. As in taking theſe covenants, men bound themſelves to the regular reformation of every thing found ſinful, when tried by the word of God, our anceſtors agreeable to Rom. xiv. 1. Iſaiah xxxv. 3, 4. were willing to help forward the weak, and admit to their covenant and church fellowſhip, every perſon, who appeared willing to receive more light. even though they were not in every reſpect, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually enlightened and reformed as themſelves. But, I defy you to prove, that they excluded one upright covenanter from their religious communion. (2.) The covenants of 1638 and 1643, were not framed to admit any who reſolved obſtinately to adhere to Epiſcopacy or Independency. In the bond of 1638, men bound themſelves to forbear the practice of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian government, and of the articles of Perth, till they ſhould be TRIED and ALLOWED in a free General Aſſembly.

You can never prove, that the covenant of 1538 was tendered to the Doctors of Aberdeen, after they had ſhown their obſtinate attachment to Prelacy. Or that Philip Nye, or any others, after manifeſting their obſtinate attachment to Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had the covenant of 1643, tendered to them by any truly zealous covenanter.

No more than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of men under civil penalties, to partake, at leaſt once a year, of the Lord's Supper, rendered it a merely civil ordinance.

If, which I do not, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Aſa and Joſiah, by penal laws, compelled men to take their covenants, you can ſcarce condemn our covenanters annexing civil penalties to the refuſal of their bonds, eſpecially as they knew, it would ſcarce come from any, but ſuch as were malignant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the civil as well as religious liberties of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (3.) In 1596, 1638, 1648, and 1649, theſe covenants had no penalty either civil or eccleſiaſtical annexed to the not ſwearing of them, without any hint from the covenanters, that this altered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the engagement.</p>

Did ten years of murderous invaſion and outrageous conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and twenty-eight years of horrible profaneneſs and perſecution make our nation ſo happy, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God our deliverer was no more nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary?

(2.) Not the alteration of the national affairs to the better, but the alteration of mens hearts to the worſe, made covenanting with God to be ſo contemned at the Reſtoration and Revolution.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That which is engaged in theſe covenants, being moral duty, commanded by the law of God, is of <hi>perpetual obligation.</hi> The whole faith and practice to which we therein engage are ſtated from the oracles of God, in our excellent Standards. If the matter in itſelf, were contrary to God's law, no human cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant could bind us, or any repreſented by us, to it for a moment. We can have no power from God to bind ourſelves or others to any thing ſinful, 2 Cor. xiii. 8. Nor can any human deed be valid in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſupreme authority.—If the matter were indifferent, no vow or promiſſory oath could lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtitute a <hi>perpetual obligation,</hi> as the alteration of circumſtances might render it very unexpedient and unedifying, 1 Cor. vi. 12. &amp; x. 23. &amp; xvi. 14 Rom. xiv. 19. But if that which is engaged, be preciſely, what every perſon, in every age or circumſtance, is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1285200500:121"/>
bound to, by the antecedent tie of the law of God, no man can be, in the leaſt, abridged of any lawful liberty, by being brought under the moſt ſolemn obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an oath or vow.—The ſtricteſt fulfilment of it cannot but tend to the real profit of every one concerned, both in his perſonal and his ſocial capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Pſal. xix. 11. 1 Cor. xv. 58. Iſa iii. 10. Proverbs xiv. 34. Rom. ii. 1,—10. It is therefore for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of us and our poſterity, to be hedged in, and bound up to the moſt exact conformity to God's law, by every mean which he requires or allows, in his word,—even as it is for our advantage to have our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty bounded by the ledges of bridges.—The law of God requires us to do every thing which is calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote or ſecure our own or our children's walking in the truth, Gen. xvii. 7. Pſal. xlv. 17. &amp; lxxviii 1,—9 Iſa. xxxviii. 19 3 John, ver. 4.—It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents ſolemn vows as a mean moſt effectual to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this purpoſe, Pſal. cxix. 106. &amp; lxxvi. 11. &amp; l. 14. &amp; lvi. 12. &amp; lxvi. 13, 14. &amp; lxi. 8. &amp; cxvi. 12,—19. &amp; cxxxii. 1,—5.

            <p n="2">2. By the repeated judicial acts of both church and ſtate, approving and impoſing theſe covenants, they were conſtituted the <hi>adopted laws</hi> of both, proper to be acknowledged and ſubmitted to, by all their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in the moſt ſolemn manner, which their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances permitted.—Several of theſe acts, as well as the beſt duties of Chriſtians, had their ſinful infirmities particularly on the head of penalties, which I mean not to defend. But in ſo far as theſe acts approved and authorized theſe covenants, which bound men to receive and hold faſt ſuch temporal and ſpiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, as God had given them, and thankfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to his glory,—and required a Chriſtian, regular, and ſeaſonable taking of them,—they were certainly good and valid. Being good in themſelves, and the exact performance of them calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the glory of God, and eminent welfare of both church and ſtate, theſe covenants, if once regularly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1285200500:122"/>
adopted as laws, muſt remain obligatory upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting ſocieties, while they exiſt. Civil rulers being ordained <hi>miniſters of God for good</hi> to men, Rom. xiii. 1,—4. and church officers appointed by Chriſt for the <hi>edifying of his body,</hi> Eph. iv. 11,—14. have no power againſt the truth, but for the truth, 2 Corinth. xiii. 8, 10. and ſo can no more repeal a law, which promotes only that which is morally good, any more than they can give validity to a ſinful one.—Theſe covenants muſt therefore, in the view of God and conſcience, continue binding, as laws divinely ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon us, as ſubjects, and as Chriſtians. But it is their much more ſolemn obligation as <hi>public Vows</hi> and <hi>Covenants with God,</hi> which I mean to eſtabliſh, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with reference to Scotland.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The matter of theſe vows being morally good, calculated to promote the holineſs and happineſs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon in every age, the immediate covenanters were ſuch as laid every poſſible foundation of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the obligation of their vow to the whole church and nation, to all generations. The REPRESENTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVES of both church and ſtate,—the MAJORITY of the Society, and our own PARENTS, in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtations, took theſe covenants. What could tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmit and extend an obligation to poſterity, if all this did not? You cannot but allow, that even in private civil deeds, the obligation is extended far beyond the <hi>immediate engagers.</hi> In bonds, reſpecting money or ſervice, men bind not only themſelves, but their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and aſſigns, eſpecially, if they have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued right to, or poſſeſſion of that fund or property from which that money or ſervice natively ariſeth. The obligations contained in a call to a miniſter, fix on the whole congregation, if ſubſcribed by the majority, without any regular diſſent,—and on ſuch as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards accede to it. The treaties of peace, traffick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contracted by Kings, Parliaments, Magiſtrates, are held binding on their ſubjects, and even on their poſterity. They, who accede to any ſociety, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the binding force of its ſocial engagements for debt, duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If bonds and covenants did only bind immediate contractors, nothing but the wildeſt diſorder would enſue. If the immediate engagers,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1285200500:123"/>
quickly after died, they who truſted to their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might be totally ruined.—A minority, who had been ſilent during the tranſaction, might, in a few days, overturn a bond or contract of the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Subjects might, at their pleaſure, render void the contracts and treaties of their rulers. To pretend, that men may not uſe the ſame freedom, in binding their repreſentees and poſterity to God, as in binding them to men, is highly abſurd and ſhocking, as it repreſents God as more dangerous, and leſs honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſeful to be dealt with, than the very worſt of men. Why may not a parent, in offering his child to God in baptiſm, take hold of God to be his God, and the God of his ſeed after him to all generations,—and dedicate not only that child, but all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to God, as his honoured vaſſals and ſervants, Gen. xvii. 7. Acts ii. 39.?—Is this leſs dutiful, ſafe, or honourable, than to infeft himſelf and them in ſome earthly property, and bind them as poſſeſſors of it, to be the vaſſals of ſome ſinful ſuperior?—If the majority of a ſociety, eſpecially in diſtreſs, may put the whole under the authority and protection of a man who is a great ſinner, why muſt they act either wickedly or fooliſhly, if, by a ſolemn dedication, they put it under the eſpecial care and protection of the Great GOD our Saviour? Rev. xi. 15. Pſal. ii. 12. &amp; xxii. 27. If the repreſentatives of a people, may bind them to live peaceably and trade honeſtly with earthly neighbours; or may, in ſome caſes, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to the power, laws, or exactions of other earthly ſuperiors,—why allow them no power to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy peace with God, and to follow peace with all men and holineſs?—No power to ſurrender them to God, to be ruled by his law,—and to render him his due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of honour?—Hath not God an original and ſupreme right to all men as his creatures, ſubjects, and children? Are they not all bound by his law to the whole of that duty, to which, we contend, any man ought to be bound by a vow of <hi>perpetual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Is it not inexpreſſibly honourable, ſafe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to ſtand under the ſpecial care of, and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God in Chriſt, Deut. iv. 7. &amp; xxxiii. 29,?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1285200500:124"/>
Why then more ſhy of devoting poſterity, or other repreſentees to him, than to a ſinful man and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?</p>
            <p>In covenants with men, a proper and timely diſſent may frequently be well founded; and may effectually divert this obligation from the diſſenters. But how there could be a lawful diſſent from an engagement carefully to keep all the commandments of God and nothing elſe, I know not. Had the whole, or even the body of the Hebrew nation, timely and regularly diſſented from the treaty made by their princes with the Gibeonites, it might have diverted its obligation from them.—Inſlead of this, they appear to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to the final ſtating of it, without a ſingle mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, Joſh. ix. But, if theſe princes had, by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, devoted themſelves and their tribes to a careful keeping of God's commandments; I know not how the people's diſſent could have diverted the obligation from themſelves.—In covenants with men, the non-fulfilment of ſome condition or ſome diſpenſation or remiſſion may weaken, if not perfectly annul, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. But none can diſpenſe with, or grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, in the matters of God. Covenants made with God are more abſolute, and leſs clogged with conditions, and ſo <hi>more obliging</hi> The covenants of which we now treat, being about indiſpenſible duties of morality, upon which dependeth the glory of God, the advancement of the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, the honour and happineſs of magiſtrates, and the public liberty, ſafety and peace of the nation, and the good of poſterity in all time coming, ought to have their obligation allowed to fix, wherever any ground can be found, while Chriſt hath a kingdom, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters a poſterity, particularly in Scotland; for,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Our civil Repreſentatives by theſe covenants devoted themſelves in their ſtation, and their ſubjects, in ſo far as under their power, to the ſervice of God. In 1581 and 1590, King James and his privy council took the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> and required their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to follow their example. In 1638, the privy council again took it, as it ſtood in 1581. In 1640, the members of Parliament took it, as explained by the Aſſembly 1638, to abjure <hi>Prelacy</hi> and the <hi>five ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1285200500:125"/>
               <hi>of Perth,</hi> and appointed it to be ſworn by all the members of every future Parliament. It was ſworn by the members of Parliament 1644. In 1649, the national covenant, and the Solemn League which was materially the ſame, were renewed by the members of Parliament, with ſolemn faſting and humiliation. The oath framed in 1641, to be ſworn by members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at taking their ſeats, expreſly approved the national covenant. King Charles I. gave a ſolemn approbation of it. King Charles II. and other magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates took the covenants in 1650 and 1651. Now, if a covenant made by the princes of Iſrael with the repreſentatives of the Gibeonites, in a matter which concerned the <hi>Lord's land</hi> and the <hi>remote ſervice oſ his altar,</hi> extended its obligation to the whole nation of Iſrael, who conſented to it, no otherwiſe, than by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence at the final ſtating of it,—and to their poſterity, for many generations,—that four hundred years after, they were puniſhed with a famine on account of Saul's breach of it, Joſh. ix. with 2 Sam. xxi. and to the Gibeonites and their poſterity;—Why not allow the covenanting deed of our Princes to extend its obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in like manner? If magiſtrates be the <hi>miniſters of God for good</hi> to men, Why ſhould they not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſurrender themſelves and their ſubjects to the ſpecial care and ſervice of God, their common and beneficent Superior? If they poſſeſs the powers aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in our excellent Standards, Why may they not, as <hi>nurſing ſathers</hi> of the church, devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſubjects of the ſame true religion, to the enjoyment of God himſelf in his oracles and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and to ſerve Him regularly in Chriſt? If Joſhua could bind himſelf and his family to ſerve the Lord, why may not magiſtrates bind themſelves and their ſubjects of the ſame true religion, to receive and hold faſt the like honour and happineſs? If for the benefit of their ſubjects, magiſtrates may, in a time of need, ſubject themſelves and their people to ſome powerful Monarch, whoſe fury is terrible, but his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour extremely profitable, or may approve and ratify ſome former grant of that kind,—Why may they not for the ſame end, devote themſelves and ſubjects to the Great GOD our Saviour, and Prince of the kings
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1285200500:126"/>
of the earth? Why may they not bring their glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church? and as judges kiſs the Son of God, ſolemnly approving and in their ſtation ratifying that grant which his Father made to him, of the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ends of the earth? Rev. xxi. 24. &amp; xi. 15. Prov. viii. 15, 16, Pſal. ii. 8,—12.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In theſe covenants our Repreſentatives in the church, in their ſtation, devoted themſelves and their people to the faith, profeſſion and obedience of Chriſt. In April 1581, the General Aſſembly unanimouſly approved the <hi>national covenant,</hi> and then in October enſuing, in the name of Chriſt, appointed it to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by all Proteſtants. In 1588 and 1590, they made further acts for promoting this ſubſcription. The general Aſſemblies of 1596, 1638, 1639, and the Commiſſions or Aſſemblies of 1643, 1644, 1648, 1649, enjoined the ſwearing of the covenant by all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult church-members. I do not know of one Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian miniſter or ruling elder in Scotland, who, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the covenanting periods of 1581, 1590, 1596, 1638, 1643, 1648, declined taking it. Now, if ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil repreſentatives may bind their ſubjects and their poſterity by civil contracts, Why ought not the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious dedication of themſelves and people to God, by church-rulers to have a like binding force? If, in public prayers, miniſters may devote themſelves and congregations to Chriſt, why may not they and ruling elders conjunctly do it, by public covenant? But we do not chiefly reſt the matter on theſe grounds; for,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is beyond all contradiction, that the lawful and public covenants civil or religious, which are made by parents, do bind their poſterity. The oath of Eſau, in which he reſigned his birthright to Jacob, bound his poſterity never to attempt recovering the privileges of it, from Jacob or his deſcendents. Hence Eſau and his family, after the death of Iſaac, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intirely from Canaan, Gen. xxv. 33. &amp; xxxvi. 6. Even the public curſe, which the Jews took upon themſelves and their children, hath been manifeſtly binding on them theſe ſeventeen hundred years paſt, Mat. xxvii 25. The vow of parents in the antient circumciſion, or the Chriſtian baptiſm of their infants,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1285200500:127"/>
extends to theſe children,—nay according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God's covenant and promiſe to all their future ſeed, Gen. xvii. 7. Acts ii. 38, 39. Hence, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any of them do contrary to that vow, muſt at once be perfidy and rebellion againſt God. Nor will their wilful or ſlothful ignorance of that obligation, or their non-conſent to it, when grown up, free them from that guilt, any more than ignorance of Adam's covenant, or of the breach of it, can free his poſterity from the guilt of his firſt ſin, or from perfidy in their perſonal violations of that covenant of works. In Deut. v. 2, 3. God, by Moſes declares, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the Iſraelites at Sinai, was not made with them only, but with all that new generation of their children and grand children, who ſurvived them, Num. xxvi. 64.—In Deut. xxix. 14, 15. he declares, that the covenant taken by that new genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the plains of Moab, did not only bind them who were alive and preſent at the entrance into it, but alſo others, even their poſterity.—Their covenant with the Gibeonites did not only bind the immediate engagers and conſenters, but alſo their poſterity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages afterward, Joſh. ix. 15, 19. with 2 Sam. xxi. 1.—Now, theſe covenants of allegiance to God and duty to men, of which we are treating, were ſworn and ſubſcribed by our own <hi>natural,</hi> tho' now <hi>mediate</hi> parents, and when it is conſidered, how FREQUENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY that covenant, the ſame in ſubſtance in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bonds, was ſworn or ſubſcribed, and how GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALLY;—and how readily ſome covenanted on one occaſion, whoſe anceſtors had not on a preceding;—and how families have been ſince intermixed, it will ſcarce remain probable, that there is a Scotchman, at leaſt on the continent of Britain or Ireland, who is not deſcended from ſome covenanter. If any, to his own diſgrace, will contend that in all theſe and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent periods of covenanting 1581, 1590, 1596, 1638, 1639, 1643, 1648, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all his progenitors were ſuch mere neutrals, or malignant oppoſers of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and liberties of the country, that none of them took the covenant, let him take heed, leſt, after all, God his Creditor find him a perjured tranſgreſſor of the covenant of his fathers,—or at leaſt, of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1285200500:128"/>
made by his church and nation, and their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) That lawful covenants, made by the greater part of a ſociety bind the whole, and every future acceder to it,—at leaſt, unleſs the minority or acceders have, by a proper diſſent, diverted the obligation from themſelves;—and that, if remarkably calculated to promote the common advantage, they bind the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, while it continues a ſociety,—Common ſenſe will not allow us to doubt. That the exact ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of our covenants with God, is remarkably cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to promote the honour of Chriſt and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the welfare of both church and ſtate, hath been formerly hinted. No perſon therefore could, or can, by any lawful diſſent, divert their binding force from himſelf. Nor do I remember of any, who regularly attempted it in Scotland.</p>
            <p>Without doubt, the majority, nay body of the Scotch nation nation entered into their Solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.

OBJECT. I. <q rend="inline">"Many things were wrong in the impoſing and taking of theſe covenants; and their words are ill choſen, as to <hi>extirpate</hi> Popery, Prelacy, <hi>i. e.</hi> to kill Papiſts and Prelatiſts."</q> ANSW. (1) Let us allow no malignant enemy or perjured violator of theſe covenants to be held a ſufficient witneſs againſt them. Nor let us have the long ago refuted calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſuch men revived upon their mere authority. (2) Though the covenant had had inſirmities, even infirmities ſufficient to have hindered the ſwearing of it, as the Doctors of Aberdeen and Oxford pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the caſe,—it may nevertheleſs bind when once it is ſworn. Though its matter had been in part ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſelf-contradictory, it would bind to the part which was lawful.—Though the authority which impoſed it, had been inſufficient, and the manner of impoſing it improper, it would bind when once ſworn. Zedekiah was in ſome reſpect compelled to ſwear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to Nebuchadnezzar, whoſe ſovereignty over Judah was very diſputable, yet his oath bound him, Ezek. xvii. 12,—19. 2 Chron. xxxvi. 13.—Though our covenanters ends had been carnal, or even ſinful, the oath, as far as lawful in its matter, is binding, when once it is ſworn.—Without allowing theſe things as <hi>fixed principles,</hi> no oaths or covenants could be any ſecurities among mankind. (3) If Popery and Prelacy be plants which God hath not planted, why may we not, as lawfully, in our ſtations, endeavour to <hi>extirpate</hi> or <hi>root</hi> them out, as we may mortify the deeds of our body, that we may live? The one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no more violence againſt mens perſons than the other, Rom. viii. 13. Do you imagine, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters ſwore to cut their own throats, or tear out their own hearts, when they engaged to endeavour, in their ſtation, to extirpate <hi>every thing contrary to the power of godlineſs,</hi> as indwelling ſin, vain thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which adhere to believers in this life, certainly are.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. II. <q rend="inline">"Many in England and Ireland never took the Solemn League, or took it in a ſenſe conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Prelacy or Independency."</q> ANSW. I do not expect that any hater of that covenant will ever be able to invalidate the proof which hath been given of the number
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1285200500:148"/>
of the covenanters in both theſe kingdoms. (2.) The covenanters declared <q rend="inline">"that an oath is to be taken in the plain ſenſe of the words, without equivocation or mental reſervation.—It cannot bind to ſin; but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing not ſinful, being taken, it binds to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, although to a man's own hurt<note n="*" place="bottom">

And indeed if oaths, vows, or covenants bind not men, according to the plain meaning of their words, they become quite uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Mens prevarication therefore, in favours of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy or Independency, cannot free them from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of an oath, which ſtrikes againſt both. (3) As the Scots ſtood bound by their National Covenant to every duty contained in the Solemn League, long before the Engliſh had a thought of covenanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, and did alſo ſwear the ſolemn league, no neglect or prevarication of either Engliſh or Iriſh can free us from our obligation. It was neither to the Engliſh nor to the Iriſh, but chiefly to the faithful and unchangeable God of all grace, that our fathers bound themſelves and their ſeed. The Aſſembly in their <hi>Letter to the council of London,</hi> juſtly obſerve, <q rend="inline">"It is not in the power of any human authority to abſolve you from adhering to this ſo ſolemnly ſworn League and Covenant."</q> And in another letter, <q rend="inline">"The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath been broken by many in both kingdoms.—We do not doubt, but there are <hi>many ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> in England, who have retained their integrity in that buſineſs."</q> And in their <hi>Warning</hi> 1648, <q rend="inline">"The violation of the covenant by ſome in England doth not ſet us free from the obligation of it. No laws, nor authority on earth can abſolve us from ſo ſolemn an obligation to the Moſt High.—We are not acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the obligation of our ſolemn covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the troubles.—In the worſt of times, all thoſe duties whereunto by covenant, we oblige our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, do ſtill ly upon us.—We have ſworn, and we muſt perform it."</q> And in their <hi>Warning</hi> 1649, <q rend="inline">"Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the League and Covenant be deſpiſed by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party in England, yet the obligation of that covenant is <hi>perpetual;</hi> and all the duties contained

therein are conſtantly to be minded and proſecuted, by every one of us and our <hi>poſterity,</hi> according to their place and ſtation."</q> And in their <hi>Letter to breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in England,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"Although there were none in the one kingdom, who did adhere to the covenant, yet were not the other kingdom, nor any perſon in either of them, abſolved from the bond thereof; ſince in it, we have not only ſworn by the Lord, but alſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with him. It is not the failing of one or more that can abſolve others from their duty or TIE to him. Beſides, the duties therein contained being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful, and the grounds of our TIE thereto moral, though others forget their duty, yet doth not their defection free us from that obligation which lies upon us by the covenants, in our places and ſtations. The covenant being intended as one of the beſt means of ſtedfaſtneſs, it were ſtrange to ſay, that the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings of any ſhould abſolve others from the TIE thereof, eſpecially ſeeing our engagement therein is <hi>not only national,</hi> but perſonal.—All theſe kingdoms joining together to aboliſh that oath by law, could not diſpenſe therewith, much leſs can any one of them, or any party in either do the ſame.—(They are) teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which the Lord Chriſt hath entred as proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to preſerve his right in theſe ends of the earth, long ago given unto him for his poſſeſſion, and of late confirmed by ſolemn covenant."</q>

            <p>OBJECT. III. <q rend="inline">"The influence of the Highland thiefs, and the groſs ignorance of the Scotch iſlands, together with the general diſlike of the covenant at the Reſtoration and Revolution, are <hi>internal eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> that but a part, perhaps a ſmall part, of the Scots took the covenant."</q> ANSW. I boldly defy you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the proofs I have brought to the contrary. Nay, for ought I know, you cannot produce one of theſe perjured Prelatiſts, that pretended that only the ſmaller part of the Scotch nation took the covenant, eſpecially in 1590, 1638, &amp; 1643. (2.) Were the Highland chiefs, and the groſs ignorance of the iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, occaſioned by the negligence of the curates, a whit more able to withſtand the enlightening and heart-bowing power of God, ſo remarkably manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on theſe occaſions, than K. Charles and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1285200500:150"/>
on the continent? Have we not produced evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that multitudes of the Highlanders entered into the reformers covenant, 1638, and were not Argyle, Mar, and many other Highland chiefs zealous cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters? Did not ſuch as were otherwiſe minded take the covenant of 1581, as impoſed by the Privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil according to its original meaning? Did not even the Doctors and Prelatic inhabitants of Aberdeen take that bond, without approving the council's limitation of it to its original meaning? (3) You can produce no evidence that the covenanting work was not carried on in the Scotch iſlands, but ſuch as we have, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Hebrew child was circumciſed on the 8th day, from Iſaac to John Baptiſt;—or that never a weekly Sabbath was obſerved from the creation till the manna fell around the Hebrew camp, <hi>i. e.</hi> want of poſitive evidence to the contrary,—and that too in places, of which, to this moment, we have little account, except what relates to their ſituation, ſoil, product, or the like. (4.) It is highly abſurd to pretend, that the ſo general diſregard of the covenants, twelve or forty years after the laſt taking of them, is <hi>internal evidence</hi> that few had taken them. Will it irrefragably prove, that Adam was never made after the image of God, or taken into covenant with him, becauſe within a few days or hours he had become a ſinner, hating both God and his covenant.—or that devils were never created holy and happy, becauſe within a few days they had left their firſt eſtate? Will the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concurrence of the Hebrews in worſhipping the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calf, prove that they had not entered into ſolemn covenant with God, about forty days before? Will their ſubſequent apoſtaſies, prove that but few of them had covenanted with God, under Joſhua, Aſa, Joaſh, Hezekiah, Joſiah, Ezra and Nehemiah? Will Peter's fearfully heinous and repeated denial of Chriſt, prove that he had not, a few hours before, ſolemnly engaged againſt it?</p>
            <p>OBJECT. IV. <q rend="inline">"Force or fear cauſed many to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant."</q> ANSW. Though force or ſear ſhould have rendered the manner of covenanting unacceptable to God, they cannot render void an oath which is ſworn. (2.) I will never contend, that the penalty annexed by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1285200500:151"/>
law to the refuſal of the covenant in 1643, or even on ſome other occaſions, was proper. But, after a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearch, I find no proper evidence, that any force was ever uſed in Scotland to make any take the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, except in 1639, by Montroſe and Monro, two military men, without any warrant from either church or ſtate,—the former, if not both of whom afterward turned out a malignant murderer of his covenanting brethren. Never, Sir, pick up or retail the mere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of perjured violators of theſe covenants, who were glad to ſay any thing to conceal or excuſe their own wickedneſs. (3.) In 1638, when the covenanting was moſt univerſal, the biſhops and ſome other anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanters, afraid of proſecution for their enormous debts, or for their oppreſſive and other wicked deeds,—and perhaps chiefly to calumniate the covenanters at court, did flee their country. But none were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do ſo for refuſing the covenant. Fear of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger probably reſtrained ſome from reviling a Bond which the nation ſo highly eſteemed But none, that I know of, were thereby conſtrained to ſwear it. Some mobs happened, occaſioned by the king's ſuſpenſion of the common exerciſe of the civil law, and the ſitting of its courts. But theſe were deteſted by the zealous covenanters, and not one of them appears either to have been intended, or to have iſſued in favours of the covenant. If the influences of God's Spirit, and the affecting appearances of his Providence—as at Sinai or in the apoſtolic age, awed or allured numbers to take the covenant whoſe hearts were not ſincere before him,—ſhould we quarrel with the Almighty on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?—But, Sir, Henderſon, Dickſon, and Cant, who being the principal leaders of the covenanting work that year, affirm to the doctors of Aberdeen, who were eager to have detected them of falſehood, if it had been poſſible, <q rend="inline">"No paſtors in our knowledge have been either forced to flee or have been threatened with the want of their ſtipends for refuſing their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; but ſome have of their own accord, gone to court for procuring protection againſt their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,—and have made lies between the king and his people. Others have wilfully refuſed to abide with their flocks, for no reaſon, but becauſe the people
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1285200500:152"/>
have ſubſcribed.—Arguments have been taken from (promiſed) augmentation of ſtipends to hinder ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Fear of worldly loſs rather hinders men to ſubſcribe, than ſcruples of conſcience.—The prelates flight ſeems rather to have proceeded from inward fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of accuſing conſciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—In this day of the Lord's power, his people have <hi>moſt willingly offered</hi> themſelves in multitudes like the dew of the morning.

through ignorance; be freed from all their ſolemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements in Baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper; and thouſands freed from all obligation of their oaths of allegiance or fidelity to magiſtrates; or even their oaths to declare the truth and nothing elſe, in witneſs bearing. Candidates for the miniſtry needed but keep themſelves in a great meaſure ignorant of the doctrines of the Confeſſion of Faith and duties of the miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al office, in order to render their ordination vows or ſubſcriptions <hi>altogether unobligatory.</hi> (2.) Being trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in the abominations of popery or prelacy, or having frequent acceſs to witneſs them, our covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anceſtors, who had common ſenſe, might have more knowledge of them, than moſt clergymen in Scotland now have; even as a common ſailor, who hath ſerved 20 years in a man of war, may have more knowledge of her tackling and other pertinents, than all the learned doctors of fix Britiſh univerſities.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. VI <q rend="inline">"If nothing be engaged to in theſe covenants, but what God hath declared or required in his word, they <hi>never could lay any obligation</hi> upon the covenanters, much leſs a perpetual obligation upon their poſterity: It is abſolutely inconſiſtent with ſound philoſophy, Chriſtianity or common ſenſe to imagine that any human deed can bind to any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the word, or required by the law of God"</q> ANSW. 1. Then it ſeems the common Proteſtant doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Confeſſion of Faith, which in your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vows you ſolemnly declared to be <hi>founded on the word of God,</hi> viz. <hi>That a man</hi> BINDS HIMSELF <hi>by oath to what is</hi> GOOD <hi>and</hi> JUST, that <hi>in</hi> ANY THING <hi>not ſinful, it</hi> BINDS <hi>to performance;</hi> That by a vow we <hi>more ſtrictly</hi> BIND OURSELVES TO NECESSARY DU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be groſly erroneous. (2) Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Papiſt or ſome ring-leader in the perjuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous violation of theſe covenants in the laſt century, you have indeed now hit upon a ſentiment, which if proven, would effectually undermine the obligation of our covenants, and for ought I know, all religion,—all morality,—all mutual truſt and order among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind along with it. If our promiſes, oaths, vows or covenants can have no <hi>binding force</hi> except in things to which the revelation and law of God cannot reach;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1285200500:154"/>
neither Adam, nor Chriſt as Mediator, could bind themſelves to fulfil God's law; and ſo there muſt be no proper, no real covenant of works or of grace; and ſo no religion among mankind. And, for the ſame reaſon, the promiſes of God, in ſo far as their matter correſponds to his natural excellencies can have <hi>no binding</hi> force; and thus the foundation of our faith and hope is quite overturned. All engagements in Baptiſm or the Lord's Supper to believe what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals, receive what he offers, and do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, muſt be abſolutely <hi>null and void,</hi> deſtitute of all <hi>binding force.</hi>—Jeſuitical equivocation and mental reſervation are no more neceſſary in the making of promiſes, covenants or vows, or in ſwearing promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory oaths of allegiance, fidelity or witneſs bearing; or in ſubſcribing Articles, Creeds or Confeſſions of Faith, Calls to miniſters, Bonds or Bills of ſervice or debt.—If the law of God, which is exceeding broad can but reach to the matter of them, and require the believing, maintaining or practiſing of what is therein engaged, that alone renders them <hi>null and void, and not binding</hi> to all intents, and purpoſes. And ſo there can be no ſuch a thing as <hi>perjury, perfidy,</hi> or <hi>breach of promiſe,</hi> except it be with reſpect to ſuch things as the law of God could not directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reach,—which if it be as perfect and exceeding broad as the Bible affirms, muſt certainly be very few and very triſling;—for <hi>where there is no law,</hi>—no binding of a law,—<hi>there can be no tranſgreſſion.</hi>—Mens promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, covenants, oaths and vows, in word or writ, in ſo far as they reſpect things to which the law of God can reach, muſt be mere <hi>villainous impoſitions,</hi> ſeeming <hi>to bind,</hi> while they do not, in the ſmalleſt degree; and therefore ought to be deteſted, inſtead of being requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made, or truſted.—For the ſame reaſon, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of parents, maſters, magiſtrates, or any other ſuperiors being <hi>human deeds,</hi> can have any <hi>binding force</hi> in any thing relative to religion, equity, kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which the law of God can reach its requirements, and hence cannot be <hi>lawfully</hi> OBEYED, or their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity regarded, except when they commend what is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely indifferent and triſling.</hi>—If human engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and commands can only bind men to that which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1285200500:155"/>
is <hi>abſolutely indifferent,</hi> it is plain, that we can only be anſwerable to men for ſuch parts of our conduct as the law of God did not reach;—but, let men once firmly believe, that their promiſes, covenants, oaths or vows, and the commands of ſuperiors, have <hi>no bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding force,</hi> but in that which is left abſolutely indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the law of God; and that they are anſwerable to men only for ſuch parts of their conduct as the law of God could not reach,—how naturally they will ruſh headlong into all manner of profligacy, every man doing that which is right in his own eyes, in every thing important. (3) How abſurd to pretend honouring of religion, or of the law of God by making it the murderer of that <hi>deputed authority</hi> which God hath, by it, granted to men; or of theſe covenants, oaths or vows, which He hath therein appointed as means of his worſhip—Not only ſcripture, but even common ſenſe dictates, that the authority of God in his law cannot be rightlyregarded, unleſs in a way of alſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingthat authority which he hath deputed to men, and all the commands or ſelf engagements which proceed from it, in due ſubordination to it. If I read my Bible daily, in obedience to the command of God as my God in Chriſt,—in obedience to Chriſt as appointed by God to be my mediatorial, prophet and king,—and at the ſame time in due ſubordination hereto,—in obedience to my civil ruler, as the miniſter of God for good to men,—in obedience to my paſtor or church judicature as the meſſenger of Chriſt to me,—in obedience to my parents or maſters as God's deputy-governors over me,—and in fulfilment of the vow, which I as God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-governor over myſelf, have laid myſelf under, according to his appointment, Where is the inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency? Muſt I wickedly put aſunder the <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>deputed</hi> authority of God, which he hath ſo cloſely and delightfully joined together? God forbid.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. VII. <q rend="inline">"What have we to do with our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's engagements in religion, to which we never gave any perſonal conſent, eſpecially after we have become capable to judge and chooſe for ourſelves,—nay to do with engagements, which I cannot prove my anceſtors ever took."</q> ANSW. (1.) To reſt obligation to pay debt or perform duty on the <hi>debtor's</hi> proving the contraction of it, or engagement to it, is highly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1285200500:156"/>
in itſelf, and opens a wide door for breaking through almoſt every engagement. According to this ſcheme you may hold your anceſtors, who lived 130 years ago unbaptized Heathens and perhaps yourſelf too, and ſo renounce your baptiſm, becauſe you <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove</hi> that ever you received it. If God, who is our <hi>creditor</hi> in theſe covenants, can prove our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors taking of them, he will hold us bound by their deed; and even though they did not take them, he will hold us bound by the deed of the ſociety and its repreſentatives. (2.) You know, that Lord —, about four hundred years ago, granted your anceſtor, the valuable eſtate of —, to be held under him and his heirs, for a very ſmall honorary ſervice, as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of vaſſalage; and that the celebrated farmer <hi>A. B.</hi> about ſix years ago took a ninety-nine years leaſe of one of your farms at a very high rent. Have you certified the preſent heirs of that Lord and Farmer, That they are no-wiſe bound by their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors deeds, unleſs they have given their own perſonal conſent,—and that the one may recal your eſtate, and the other may keep your farm, and refuſe to pay you any rent?—You have not, nor ever will You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch freedoms only to be uſed with God,—not with yourſelf;—too ſtrong a preſumption, That you more value your eſtate and rent, than all that you hold of God in religion, and all the honour you owe to him. (3.) If our fathers bound us to any thing in religion which is not warranted by the word of God, we have nothing to do with it, but to bewail their ſin in ſuch engagement. But, if they bound us to what is commanded by the law of God, we muſt ſtand bound,—till we prove from ſcripture, that vows binding to duty are not lawful; or that fathers have no right to devote their children to God's ſervice. No ſlothful or wilful ignorance or withholding of perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, can ſo much as excuſe the non-performance of ſuch engagements. Nothing can free from their <hi>binding force,</hi> which would not annual our baptiſmal vows. (4) Once more, Sir, be pleaſed to review theſe public covenants of our fathers, in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal contents and meaning. They were a <hi>ſolemn acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence</hi> in and <hi>confirmation</hi> of God's grant of the utmoſt ends of the earth to his Son Jeſus Chriſt for hs poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1285200500:157"/>
They implied a <hi>ſolemn acceptance</hi> of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Chriſt as the God, Saviour and portion of the covenanters and their poſterity freely granted to them in the goſpel,—and of his oracles and ordinances as the means of familiar fellowſhip with Him,—a <hi>reſolution</hi> through his grace to retain him and them, as their ineſtimable privileges,—and a <hi>ſolemn engagement,</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to improve theſe privileges in an holy obedience to all his commandments, to promote his glory, and the temporal, ſpiritual and eternal advantage of theſe covenanters and their ſeed. Now, Sir, do you ſo heartily envy our Redeemer his Father's grant of the ends of the earth for his poſſeſſion, Pſal. ii. 8. that you would gladly renounce our anceſtors ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in it? Do do you ſo heartily diſlike the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a reconciled God in Chriſt for your and your poſterity's God, Saviour and portion, and his pure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and ordinances for your privileges, that you would fondly renounce a ſolemn acceptance of God's gracious grant of them ſealed and conſirmed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable influences of his Spirit? Do you ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value theſe enjoyments, and hate a grateful and ſelf-profiting obedience to all the commandments of God, that you would gladly renounce a ſolemn obligation to it? Or, are you offended with the declared ends of theſe covenants, <hi>viz.</hi> the glorifying of God, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and reformation of religion and promoting the welfare of the nation,—and that God may delight to dwell among us to the lateſt poſterity?—You will perhaps pretend, that you love our reformed doctrine. worſhip, Preſbyterian government and diſcipline; but hate to be bound to them, eſpecially by others than yourſelf. But, Sir, for the ſame reaſon you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your baptiſmal engagements, and ſtate your quarrel with God himſelf, who hath appointed vows. as his ordinance for hedging up men to their duty, and who hath entered into covenants with parents for their poſterity as well as for themſelves. Moreover, it is ſcarce credible, that you can love every thing engaged to in a vow, and yet hate to be bound by it, after God hath ſignally countenanced it. It is ſcarce poſſible, that my wife can dearly love her huſband, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and enjoyments of my family, if ſhe hate and wiſh to renounce her marriage Vow.</p>
