            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECTION I.</head>
            <p>Of the General Principles of MORALS.</p>
            <p>DISPUTES with Perſons, pertinaciouſly
obſtinate in their Principles, are, of all
others, the moſt irkſome; except, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
thoſe with Perſons, who really do not believe
at all the Opinion they defend, but engage in the
Controverſy, from Affectation, from a Spirit of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or from a Deſire of ſhowing Wit and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
ſuperior to the reſt of Mankind. The ſame
blind Adherence to their own Arguments is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in both; the ſame Contempt of their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts;
and the ſame paſſionate Vehemence, in inforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sophiſtry and Falſhood. And as reaſoning is
not the Source, whence either Diſputant derives his
Tenets; 'tis in vain to expect, that any Logic, which
ſpeaks not to the Affections, will ever engage him to
embrace ſounder Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0352600600:6"/>
THOSE who have refuſed the Reality of moral
Diſtinctions, may be ranked in the latter Claſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the diſingenuous Diſputants; nor is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
that any human Creature could ever ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
believe, that all Characters and Actions were
alike entitled to the Affection and Regard of every
one. The Difference, which Nature has plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
one Man and another, is ſo wide, and this
Difference is ſtill ſo much farther widened, by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Example, and Habit, that, where the oppoſite
Extremes come at once under our Apprehenſion,
there is no Scepticiſm ſo ſcrupulous, and ſcarce any
Aſſurance ſo determin'd, as abſolutely to deny all
Diſtinction betwixt them. Let a Man's Inſenſibility
be ever ſo great, he muſt often be touch'd with the
Images of RIGHT and WRONG; and let his
Prejudices be ever ſo obſtinate, he muſt obſerve, that
others are ſuſceptible of like Impreſſions. The only
Way, therefore, of converting an Antagoniſt of this
Kind, is to leave him to himſelf. For, finding that
No-body keeps up the Controverſy with him, 'tis
probable he will, at laſt, of himſelf, from mere
Wearineſs, come over to the Side of common Senſe
and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>THERE has been a Controverſy ſtarted of late,
much better worth Examination, concerning the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0352600600:7"/>
general Foundation of MORALS, whether they
are derived from REASON or from SENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT;
whether we attain the Knowledge of
them by a Chain of Argument and Deduction, or by
an immediate Feeling and finer internal Senſe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like all ſound Judgment of Truth and Falſhood,
they ſhould be the ſame in every rational intelligent
Being; or whether, like the Perception of Beauty
and Deformity, they are founded entirely on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Fabric and Conſtitution of the human Species.</p>
            <p>THE antient Philoſophers, tho' they often affirm,
that Virtue is nothing but Conformity to Reaſon, yet,
in general, ſeem to conſider Morals as deriving their
Exiſtence from Taſte and Sentiment. On the other
Hand, our modern Enquirers, tho' they alſo talk
much of the Beauty of Virtue, and Deformity of
Vice, yet have commonly endeavoured to account
for theſe Diſtinctions by metaphyſical Reaſonings,
and by Deductions from the moſt abſtract Principles
of human Underſtanding. Such Confuſion reign'd
in theſe Subjects, that an Oppoſition of the greateſt
Conſequence could prevail betwixt one Syſtem and
another, and even in the Parts almoſt of each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Syſtem; and yet No-body, till very lately, was
ever ſenſible of it. The elegant and ſublime Lord
<hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> who firſt gave Occaſion to remark this
Diſtinction, and who, in general, adher'd to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0352600600:8"/>
Principles of the Antients, is not, himſelf, entirely
free from the ſame Confuſion.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be acknowledged, that both Sides of the
Queſtion are ſuſceptible of ſpecious Arguments.
Moral Diſtinctions, it may be ſaid, are diſcernible by
pure <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Elſe, whence the many Diſputes, that
reign, in common Life, as well as in Philoſophy,
with regard to this Subject: The long Chain of Proofs
often adduc'd on both Sides; the Examples cited, the
Authorities appeal'd to, the Analogies employ'd, the
Fallacies detected, the Inferences drawn, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Concluſions adjuſted to their proper Principles.
Truth is diſputable; not, Taſte: What exiſts in the
Nature of Things is the Standard of our Judgment;
what each Man feels within himſelf is the Standard
of Sentiment. Propoſitions in Geometry may be
prov'd, Syſtems in Phyſics may be controverted;
but the Harmony of Verſe, the Tenderneſs of Paſſion,
the Brilliancy of Wit muſt give immediate Pleaſure.
No Man reaſons concerning another's Beauty; but
frequently concerning the Juſtice or Injuſtice of his
Actions. In every Trial of Criminals, their firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is to diſprove the Facts alledged, and deny the
Actions imputed to them: The ſecond to prove, that
even if theſe Actions were real, they might be juſtified,
as innocent and lawful. 'Tis confeſſedly by Deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Underſtanding, that the firſt Point is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0352600600:9"/>
How can we ſuppoſe, that a different Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Mind is employ'd in fixing the other?</p>
            <p>ON the other Hand, thoſe, who would reſolve all
moral Determinations into <hi>Sentiment,</hi> may endeavour
to ſhow, that 'tis impoſſible for Reaſon ever to draw
Concluſions of this Nature. To Virtue, ſay they,
it belongs to be <hi>amiable,</hi> and Vice <hi>odious.</hi> This forms
their very Nature or Eſſence. But can Reaſon or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation
diſtribute theſe different Epithets to any
Subjects, and pronounce <hi>a priori,</hi> that this muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Love, and that Hatred? Or what other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can we ever aſſign for theſe Affections, but the
original Fabric and Formation of the human Mind,
which is naturally adapted to receive them?</p>
            <p>THE End of all moral Speculations is to teach us
our Duty; and by proper Repreſentations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Vice and Beauty of Virtue, beget cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent
Habits, and engage us to avoid the one,
and embrace the other. But is this ever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from Inferences and Concluſions of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
which, of themſelves, have no Hold of
the Affections, nor ſet the active Powers of Men in
Motion and Employment? They diſcover Truth;
but where the Truths they diſcover are indifferent,
and beget no Deſire or Averſion, they can have no
Influence on Conduct and Behaviour. What is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0352600600:10"/>
what is fair, what is becoming, what is
noble, what is generous, takes Poſſeſſion of the Heart,
and animates us to embrace and to maintain it. What
is intelligible, what is evident, what is probable,
what is true, procures only the cool Aſſent of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
and gratifying a ſpeculative Curioſity,
puts an end to our Reſearches.</p>
            <p>EXTINGUISH all the warm Feelings and Prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in favour of Virtue, and all Diſguſt or Averſion
againſt Vice: Render Men totally indifferent towards
theſe Diſtinctions; and Morality is no longer a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Study, nor has any Tendency to regulate our
Lives and Actions.</p>
            <p>THESE Arguments on both Sides (and many more
might be adduc'd) are ſo plauſible, that I am apt to
ſuſpect they may, both of them, be ſolid and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
and that <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Sentiment</hi> concur in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all moral Determinations and Concluſions.
The final Sentence, 'tis probable, which pronounces
Characters and Actions amiable or odious, praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
or blameable; that which ſtamps on them
the Mark of Honour or Infamy, Approbation or
Cenſure; that which renders Morality an active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and conſtitutes Virtue our Happineſs, and Vice
our Miſery: 'Tis probable, I ſay, that this final
Sentence depends on ſome internal Senſe or Feeling,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0352600600:11"/>
which Nature has made univerſal to the whole
Species. For what elſe can have an Influence of this
Nature? But, in order to pave the Way for ſuch a
Sentiment, and give Men a proper Diſcernment of
its Object, 'tis often neceſſary, we find, that much
Reaſoning ſhould precede, that nice Diſtinctions
he made, juſt Concluſions drawn, diſtant Compariſons
form'd, accurate Relations examin'd, and general
Facts fix'd and aſcertain'd. Some Species of Beauty,
eſpecially the natural Kinds, on their firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
command our Affection, and Approbation;
and where they fail of this Effect, 'tis impoſſible for
any Reaſoning to redreſs their Influence, or adapt
them better to our Taſte and Sentiment. But in many
Orders of Beauty, particularly thoſe of the finer
Arts, 'tis requiſite to employ much Reaſoning, in
order to feel the proper Sentiment; and a falſe Reliſh
may frequently be corrected by Argument and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.
There are juſt Grounds to conclude, that
moral Beauty partakes much of this latter Species,
and demands the Aſſiſtance of our intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
in order to give it a ſuitable Influence on the
human Mind.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' this Queſtion, concerning the general
Principle of Morals, be extremely curious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant;
'tis needleſs for us, at preſent, to employ
farther Care in our Enquiries concerning it. For if
we can be ſo happy, in the Courſe of this Enquiry,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0352600600:12"/>
as to fix the juſt Origin of Morals, 'twill then eaſily
appear how far Sentiment or Reaſon enters into all
Determinations of this Nature<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix Firſt.</note>. Mean while, it
will ſcarce be poſſible for us, 'ere this Controverſy is
fully decided, to proceed in that accurate Manner,
requir'd in the Sciences; by beginning with exact
Definitions of VIRTUE and VICE, which are
the Objects of our preſent Enquiry. But we ſhall do
what may juſtly be eſteem'd as ſatisfactory. We ſhall
conſider the Matter as an Object of Experience.
We ſhall call <hi>every Quality or Action of the Mind,</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
<hi>which is attended with the general Approbation
of Mankind:</hi> And we ſhall denominate vicious, <hi>every
Quality, which is the Object of general Blame or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
Theſe Qualities we ſhall endeavour to collect;
and after examining, on both Sides, the ſeveral
Circumſtances, in which they agree, 'tis hop'd we
may, at laſt, reach the Foundation of Ethics, and
find thoſe univerſal Principles, from which all moral
Blame or Approbation is ultimately derived. As
this is a Queſtion of Fact, not of abſtract Science,
we can only expect Succeſs, by following this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
Method, and deducing general Maxims from
a Compariſon of particular Inſtances. The other
ſcientifical Method; where a general abſtract Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
is firſt eſtabliſh'd, and is afterwards branch'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0352600600:13"/>
out into a Variety of Inferences and Concluſions,
may be more perfect in itſelf, but ſuits leſs the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection

Source of Illuſion and Miſtake, in this as well as in
other Subjects. Men are now cured of their Paſſion
for Hypotheſes and Syſtems in natural Philoſophy,
and will hearken to no Arguments but thoſe deriv'd
from Experience. 'Tis full Time they ſhould begin
a like Reformation in all moral Diſquiſitions; and

               <p>THERE is a Principle, ſuppos'd to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many, which is utterly incompatible
with all Virtue or moral Sentiment; and as it can
proceed from nothing but the moſt deprav'd Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
ſo in its Turn it tends ſtill farther to foſter and
encourage that Depravity. This Principle is, that
all <hi>Benevolence</hi> is mere Hypocriſy, Friendſhip a Cheat,
Public Spirit a Farce, Fidelity a Snare to procure
Truſt and Confidence; and while all of us, at the
Bottom, purſue only our private Intereſt, we wear
theſe fair Diſguiſes, in order to put others off their
Guard, and expoſe them the more to our Wiles and
Machinations. What Heart one muſt be poſſeſs'd
of, who profeſſes ſuch Principles, and who feels no
internal Sentiment to belye ſo pernicious a Theory,
'tis eaſy to imagine: And alſo, what Degree of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Benevolence he can bear to a Species,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0352600600:15"/>
whom he repreſents under ſuch odious Colours, and
ſuppoſes ſo little ſuſceptible of Gratitude or any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of Affection. Or if we will not aſcribe theſe
Principles altogether to a corrupted Heart, we muſt,
at leaſt, account for them from the moſt careleſs and
precipitate Examination. Superficial Reaſoners,
indeed, obſerving many falſe Pretences amongſt
Mankind, and feeling, perhaps, no very ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
in their own Diſpoſition, might draw a general
and a haſty Concluſion, that all is equally corrupted,
and that Men, different from all other Animals, and
indeed from all other Species of Exiſtence, admit of
no Degrees of Good or Bad, but are, in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the ſame Creatures, under different Diſguiſes
and Appearances.</p>
               <p>THERE is another Principle, ſomewhat reſembling,
the former; which has been much inſiſted on by
Philoſophers, and has been the Foundation of many
a fair Syſtem; that whatever Affection one may feel,
or imagine he feels for others, no Paſſion is, or can
be diſintereſted; that the moſt generous Friendſhip,
however ſincere, is a Modification of Self-love; and,
that even unknown to Ourſelves, we ſeek only our
Gratification, while we appear the moſt deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in Schemes for the Liberty and Happineſs of
Mankind. By a Turn of Imagination, by a Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reflection, by an Enthuſiaſin of Paſſion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0352600600:16"/>
we ſeem to take Part in the Intereſts of others, and
imagine Ourſelves diveſted of all ſelfiſh Views and
Conſiderations: But at the Bottom, the moſt generous
Patriot and moſt niggardly Miſer, the braveſt Hero
and moſt abject Coward, have, in every Action, an
equal Regard to their own Happineſs and Welfare.</p>
               <p>WHOEVER concludes, from the ſeeming Tendency
of this Opinion, that thoſe, who make Profeſſion of
it, cannot poſſibly feel the true Sentiments of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,
or have any Regard for genuine Virtue, will
often find himſelf, in Practice, very much miſtaken.
Probity and Honour were no Strangers to <hi>Epicurus</hi>
and his Sect. <hi>Atticus</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> ſeem to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
from Nature, and cultivated by Reflection, as
generous and friendly Diſpoſitions as any Diſciple of
the auſterer Schools. And amongſt the Moderns,
<hi>Hobbes</hi> and <hi>Locke,</hi> who maintain'd the ſelfiſh Syſtem
of Morals, liv'd moſt irreproachable Lives; tho' the
former lay not under any Reſtraints of Religion,
which might ſupply the Defects of his Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>AN <hi>Epicurean</hi> or a <hi>Hobbiſt</hi> readily allows, that there
is ſuch a Thing as Friendſhip in the World, without
Hypocriſy or Diſguiſe; tho' he may attempt, by a
philoſophical Chymiſtry, to reſolve the Elements of
this Paſſion, if I may ſo ſpeak, into thoſe of another,
and explain every Affection to be Self-love, twiſted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0352600600:17"/>
and moulded into a Variety of Shapes and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
But as the ſame Turn of Imagination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
not in every Man, nor gives the ſame Direction
to the original Paſſion; this is ſufficient, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſelfiſh Syſtem, to make the wideſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in human Characters, and denominate one
Man virtuous and humane, another vicious and
meanly intereſted. I eſteem the Man, whoſe Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,
by whatever Means, is ſo directed as to give
him a Concern for others, and render him ſerviceable
to Society: As I hate or deſpiſe him, who has no
Regard to any Thing beyond his own pitiful Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Enjoyments. In vain would you ſuggeſt,
that theſe Characters, tho' ſeemingly oppoſite, are,
at the Bottom, the ſame, and that a very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Turn of Imagination forms the whole Difference
betwixt them. Each Character, notwithſtanding
theſe inconſiderable Differences, appears to me, in
Practice, pretty durable and untranſmutable. And
I find not, in this, more than in other Subjects, that
the natural Sentiments, ariſing from the general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of Things, are eaſily deſtroy'd by reſin'd
Reflections concerning the minute Origin of theſe
Appearances. Does not the lively, cheerful Colour
of a Countenance inſpire me with Complacency and
Pleaſure; even tho' I learn from Philoſophy, that all
Difference of Complexion ariſes from the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0352600600:18"/>
Differences of Thickneſs, in the moſt minute
Parts of the Skin; by which Differences one Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
is qualify'd to reflect one of the original Colours
of Light, and abſorb the others?</p>
               <p>BUT tho' the Queſtion, concerning the univerſal
or partial Selfiſhneſs of Man, be not ſo material, as
is uſually imagin'd, to Morality and Practice, it is
certainly of great Conſequence in the ſpeculative
Science of human Nature, and is a proper Object of
Curioſity and Enquiry. It may not, therefore, be
improper, in this Place, to beſtow a few Reflections
upon it<note n="*" place="bottom">Benevolence naturally divides into two Kinds, the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular.</hi> The firſt is, where we have no Friendſhip or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion or Eſteem for the Perſon, but feel only a general Sympathy with him or a Compaſſion for his Pains, and a Congratulation with his Pleaſures. The other Species of Benevolence is founded on an Opinion of Virtue, on Services done us, or on ſome particular Cornexions. Both theſe Sentiments muſt be allow'd real in human Nature; but whether they will reſolve into ſome nice Conſiderations of Self-love, is a Queſtion more curious than important. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sentiment, <hi>viz.</hi> that of general Benevolence or Humanity or Sympathy, we ſhall have Occaſion frequently to treat of in the Courſe of theſe Eſſays; and I aſſume it as real, from general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, without any other Proof.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE moſt obvious Objection to the ſelfiſh Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
is, that being contrary to common Feeling and
our moſt unprejudic'd Notions and Opinions; there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0352600600:19"/>
is requir'd the higheſt Stretch of Philoſophy to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
ſo extraordinary a Paradox. To the moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Obſerver, there appear to be ſuch Diſpoſitions as
Benevolence and Generoſity; ſuch Affections as
Love, Friendſhip, Compaſſion, Gratitude. Theſe
Sentiments have their Cauſes, Effects, Objects, and
Operations, markt by common Language and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and plainly diſtinguiſh'd from the ſelfiſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
And as this is the obvious Appearance of
Things, it muſt be admitted; till ſome Hypotheſis be
diſcover'd, which, by penetrating deeper into human
Nature, may prove the former Affections to be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Modifications of the latter. All Attempts
of this Kind have hitherto prov'd fruitleſs, and ſeem
to have proceeded entirely from that Love of <hi>Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
which has been the Source of much falſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
in Philoſophy. I ſhall not here enter into any
Detail on the preſent Subject. Many able Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have ſhown the Inſufficiency of theſe Syſtems.
And I ſhall take for granted what, I believe, the
ſmalleſt Reflection will make evident to every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Enquirer.</p>
               <p>BUT the Nature of the Subject furniſhes the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Preſumption, that no better Syſtem will ever, for
the future, be invented, to account for the Origin of
the benevolent from the ſelfiſh Affections, and reduce
all the various Emotions of the human Mind to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0352600600:20"/>
Simplicity and Uniformity. The Caſe is not the
ſame in this Species of Philoſophy as in Phyſics.
Many an Hypotheſis in Nature, contrary to firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
has been found, on more accurate Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
ſolid and ſatisfactory. Inſtances of this Kind
are ſo frequent, that a judicious, as well as witty Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<note n="*" place="bottom">Monſr. <hi>Fontenelle.</hi>
                  </note> has ventur'd to affirm, if there be more
than one Way, in which any Phaenomenon may be
produc'd, that there is a general Preſumption for its
ariſing from the Cauſes, which are the leaſt obvious
and familiar. But the Preſumption always lies on the
other Side, in all Enquiries concerning the Origin of
our Paſſions, and the internal Operations of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Mind. The ſimpleſt and moſt obvious Cauſe,
that can there be aſſign'd for any Phaenomenon, is
probably the true one. When a Philoſopher, in the
Explication of his Syſtem, is oblig'd to have Recourſe
to ſome very intricate and refin'd Reflections, and to
ſuppoſe them eſſential to the Production of any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or Emotion, we have Reaſon to be extremely on
our Guard againſt ſo fallacious an Hypotheſis. The
Affections are not ſuſceptible of any Impreſſion from
the Refinements of Reaſon or Imagination; and 'tis
always found, that a vigorous Exertion of the latter
Faculties, from the narrow Capacity of the human
Mind, deſtroys all Energy and Activity in the former.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0352600600:21"/>
Our predominant Motive or Intention is, indeed,
frequently conceal'd from Ourſelves, when it is
mingled and confounded with others, which the
Mind, from Vanity or Self-conceit, is deſirous of
ſuppoſing of greater Force and Influence: But there
is no Inſtance, that a Concealment of this Nature
has ever ariſen from the Abſtruſeneſs and Intricacy
of the Motive. A Man, who has loſt a Friend and
Patron, may flatter himſelf, that all his Grief ariſes
from generous Sentiments, without any Mixture of
narrow or intereſted Conſiderations: But a Man, who
grieves for a valuable Friend, that needed his Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and Protection; how can we ſuppoſe, that his
paſſionate Tenderneſs ariſes from ſome metaphyſical
Regards to a Self-intereſt, which has no Foundation
or Reality? We may as well imagine, that minute
Wheels and Springs, like thoſe of a Watch, give
Motion to a loaded Waggon, as account for the
Origin of Paſſion from ſuch abſtruſe Reflections.</p>
               <p>ANIMALS are found ſuſceptible of Kindneſs, both
to their own Species and to ours; nor is there, in
this Caſe, the leaſt Suſpicion of Diſguiſe or Artifice.
Shall we account for all <hi>their</hi> Sentiments too, from
refin'd Deductions of Self-intereſt? Or if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a diſintereſted Benevolence in the inferior Species,
by what Rule of Analogy can we refuſe it in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0352600600:22"/>
LOVE betwixt the Sexes begets a Complacency
and Good-will, very diſtinct from the Gratification
of an Appetite. Tenderneſs to their Offspring, in
all ſenſible Beings, is commonly able alone to
counterballance the ſtrongeſt Motives of Self-love,
and has no Manner of Dependance on that Affection.
What Intereſt can a fond Mother have in View, who
loſes her Health by aſſiduous Attendance on her ſick
Child, and afterwards languiſhes, and dies for Grief,
when freed, by its Death, from the Slavery of that
Attendance?</p>
               <p>Is Gratitude no Affection of the human Breaſt, or is
that a Word merely, without any Meaning or Reality?
Have we no Complacency or Satisfaction in one
Man's Company above another's, and no Deſire of
the Welfare of our Friend, even tho' Abſence or
Death ſhould prevent us from all Participation in it?
Or what is it commonly, that gives us any Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
in it, even while alive and preſent, but our
Affection and Regard to him?</p>
               <p>THESE and a thouſand other Inſtances are Marks
of a generous Benevolence in human Nature, where
no <hi>real</hi> Intereſt binds us to the Object. And how an
<hi>imaginary</hi> Intereſt, known and avow'd for ſuch, can
be the Origin of any Paſſion or Emotion, ſeems dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0352600600:23"/>
to explain. No ſatisfactory Hypotheſis of this
Kind has yet been diſcover'd; nor is there the ſmalleſt
Probability, that the future Induſtry of Men will ever
be attended with more favourable Succeſs.</p>
               <p>BUT farther, if we conſider rightly of the Matter,
we ſhall find, that the Hypotheſis, which allows of a
diſintereſted Benevolence, diſtinct from Self-love, has
really more <hi>Simplicity</hi> in it, and is more conformable
to the Analogy of Nature, than that which pretends
to reſolve all Friendſhip and Humanity into this latter
Principle. There are bodily Wants or Appetites,
acknowledged by every one, which neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
all ſenſual Enjoyment, and carry us directly to
ſeek Poſſeſſion of the Object. Thus, Hunger and
Thirſt have eating and drinking for their End; and
from the Gratification of theſe primary Appetites
ariſes a Pleaſure, which may become the Object of
another Species of Deſire or Inclination, that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
and intereſted. In the ſame Manner, there
are mental Paſſions, by which we are impell'd
immediately to ſeek particular Objects, ſuch as
Fame or Power or Vengeance, without any Regard
to Intereſt; and when theſe Objects are attain'd, a
pleaſing Enjoyment enſues, as the Conſequence of our
indulg'd Affections. Nature muſt, by the internal
Frame and Conſtitution of the Mind, give an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Propenſity to Fame, 'ere we can reap any Pleaſure
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0352600600:24"/>
from it, or purſue it from Motives of Self-love, and
a Deſire of Happineſs. If I have no Vanity, I take
no Delight in Praiſe: If I be void of Ambition,
Power gives no Enjoyment: If I be not angry, the
Puniſhment of an Adverſary is totally indifferent to
me. In all theſe Caſes, there is a Paſſion, which
points immediately to the Object, and conſtitutes it
our Good or Happineſs; as there are other ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
Paſſions, which afterwards ariſe, and purſue it
as a Part of our Happineſs, when once it is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
ſuch, by our original Affections. Were there
no Appetites of any Kind, antecedent to Self-love,
that Propenſity could ſcarce ever exert itſelf; becauſe
we ſhould, in that Caſe, have felt few and ſlender
Pains or Pleaſures, and have little Miſery or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to avoid or to purſue.</p>
               <p>Now where is the Difficulty of conceiving, that
this may likewiſe be the Caſe with Benevolence and
Friendſhip, and that, from the original Frame of our
Temper, we may feel a Deſire of another's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Good, which, by Means of that Affection,
becomes our own Good, and is afterwards purſued,
from the conjoin'd Motives of Benevolence and Self-enjoyment?
Who ſees not that Vengeance, from
the Force alone of Paſſion, may be ſo eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
as to make us knowingly neglect every Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Eaſe, Intereſt, or Safety; and, like
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0352600600:25"/>
ſome vindictive Animals, infuſe our very Souls into
the Wounds we give an Enemy<note n="*" place="bottom">Animaſque in vulnere ponunt. VIRG. Dom alteri noceat, ſoi negligens, ſays <hi>Scneca</hi> of Anger, De Ira. L. 1.</note>? And what a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Philoſophy muſt it be, that will not allow, to
Humanity and Friendſhip, the ſame Privileges, which
are indiſputably granted to the darker Paſſions of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Reſentment? Such a Philoſophy is
more like a Satyr, than a true Delineation or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
of human Nature; and may be a good

a very bad one for any ſerious Argument or Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>IT may be eſteem'd, perhaps, a ſuperfluous Task
to prove, that the benevolent or ſofter Affections
are VIRTUOUS; and wherever they appear,

               <p>As theſe Topics of Praiſe never fail to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
and with Succeſs, where we would inſpire
Eſteem for any one; may we not thence conclude,
that the UTILITY, reſulting from the ſocial
Virtues, forms, at leaſt, a <hi>Part</hi> of their Merit, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0352600600:30"/>
is <hi>one</hi> Source of that Approbation and Regard ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally

               <p>WHEN we recommend even an Animal or Plant as
<hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>beneficial,</hi> we give it an Applauſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
ſuited to its Nature. As on the
other Hand, Reflection on the baneful Influence of
any of theſe inferior Beings always inſpires us with
the Sentiments of Averſion. The Eye is pleas'd
with the Proſpect of Corn-fields and loaded Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards;
Horſes grazing, and Flocks paſturing: But
flies the View of Bryars and Brambles, affording
Shelter to Wolves and Serpents.</p>
               <p>A Machine, a Piece of Furniture, a Garment, a
Houſe, well contriv'd for Uſe and Conveniency, is
ſo far beautiful, and is contemplated with Pleaſure
and Approbation. An experienc'd Eye is here ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

               <p>CAN any Thing ſtronger be ſaid in Praiſe of a

IN all Determinations of Morality, this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of public Utility is ever principally in View;
and wherever Diſputes ariſe, whether in Philoſophy
or common Life, concerning the Bounds of Duty,
the Queſtion cannot, by any Means, be decided
with greater Certainty, than by aſcertaining, on any
Side, the true Intereſts of Mankind. If any falſe
Opinion, embrac'd from Appearances, has been
found to prevail; as ſoon as farther Experience,
and ſounder Reaſoning have given us juſter Notions
of human Affairs; we retract our firſt Sentiments,
and adjuſt a-new the Boundaries of moral Good and
Evil.</p>
               <p>ALMS to common Beggars is naturally prais'd;
becauſe it ſeems to carry Relief to the diſtreſt
and indigent: But when we obſerve the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thence ariſing to Idleneſs and Debauchery, we
regard that Species of Charity rather as a Weakneſs
than a Virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tyrannicide</hi> or the Aſſaſſination of Uſurpers and
oppreſſive Princes was highly prais'd in antient
Times; becauſe it both freed Mankind from many
of theſe Monſters, and ſeem'd to keep the others in
Awe, whom the Poinard or the Poiſon could not reach.
But Hiſtory and Experience having ſince convinc'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0352600600:33"/>
us, that this Practice encreaſes the Jealouſy and
Cruelty of Princes; a <hi>Timoleon</hi> and a <hi>Brutus,</hi> tho'
treated with Indulgence on Account of the Prejudices
of their Times, are now conſider'd as very improper
Models for Imitation.</p>
               <p>LIBERATITY in Princes is regarded as a Mark of
Beneficence: But when it occurs, that the homely
Bread of the Honeſt and Induſtrious is often thereby
converted into delicious Cates for the Idle and the
Prodigal, we ſoon retract our heedleſs Praiſes. The
Regrets of a Prince, for having loſt a Day, were
noble and generous: But had he intended to have
ſpent it in Acts of Generoſity to his greedy Courtiers,
'twas better loſt than miſemploy'd after that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>LUXURY, or a Refinement on the Pleaſures and
Conveniencies of Life, had long been ſuppos'd the
Source of every Corruption and Diſorder in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the immediate Cauſe of Faction,
Sedition, civil Wars, and the total Loſs of Liberty.
It was, therefore, univerſally regarded as a Vice,
and was an Object of Declamation to all Satyriſts
and ſevere Moraliſts. Thoſe, who prove, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to prove, that ſuch Refinements rather tend to
the Encreaſe of Induſtry, Civility, and Arts, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
a new our <hi>moral</hi> as well as <hi>political</hi> Sentiments,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0352600600:34"/>
and repreſent as laudable and innocent, what had
formerly been regarded as pernicious and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>UPON the Whole, then, it ſeems undeniable, <hi>that</hi>
there is ſuch a Sentiment in human Nature as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted
Benevolence; <hi>that</hi> nothing can beſtow
more Merit on any human Creature than the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of it in an eminent Degree; and <hi>that</hi> a <hi>Part,</hi>
at leaſt, of its Merit ariſes from its Tendency to
promote the Intereſts of our Species, and beſtow
Happineſs on human Society. We carry our View
into the ſalutary Conſequences of ſuch a Character
and Diſpoſition; and whatever has ſo benign an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
and forwards ſo deſirable an End is beheld
with Complacency and Pleaſure. The ſocial Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are never regarded without their beneficial
Tendencies, nor view'd as barren and unfruitful.
The Happineſs of Mankind, the Order of Society,
the Harmony of Families, the mutual Support of
Friends are always conſider'd as the Reſult of their
gentle Dominion over the Breaſts of Men.</p>
               <p>How conſiderable a <hi>Part</hi> of their Merit we ought

are the <hi>ſole</hi> Foundation of its Merit; this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
being more curious and important, will
better deſerve our Examination and Enquiry.</p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe, that Nature has beſtow'd on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Race ſuch profuſe <hi>Abundance</hi> of all <hi>external</hi>
Conveniencies, that, without any Uncertainty in the
Event, without any Care or Induſtry on our Part,
every Individual finds himſelf fully provided of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0352600600:36"/>
whatever his moſt voracious Appetites can want, or
luxurious Imagination wiſh or deſire. His natural
Beauty, we ſhall ſuppoſe, ſurpaſſes all acquir'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments:
The perpetual Clemency of the Seaſons
renders uſeleſs all Cloaths or Covering: The raw
Herbage affords him the moſt delicious Fare; the
clear Fountain, the richeſt Beverage. No laborious
Occupation requir'd: No Tillage: No Navigation.
Muſic, Poetry, and Contemplation form his ſole
Buſineſs: Converſation, Mirth, and Friendſhip his
ſole Amuſement.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems evident, that, in ſuch a happy State,
every other ſocial Virtue would flouriſh, and receive
a tenfold Encreaſe; but the cautious, jealous Virtue
of Juſtice would never once have been dreamt of.
For what Purpoſe make a Partition of Goods, where
every one has already more than enough? Why
give Riſe to Property, where there cannot poſſibly
be any Injury? Why call this Object <hi>mine,</hi> when,
upon the Seizure of it by another, I need but ſtretch
out my Hand to poſſeſs myſelf of what is equally
valuable? Juſtice, in that Caſe, being totally
USELESS, would be an idle Ceremonial, and
could never poſſibly have Place amongſt the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Virtues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0352600600:37"/>
WE ſee, even in the preſent neceſſitous Condition
of Mankind, that, wherever any Benefit is beſtow'd
by Nature in an unlimited Abundance, we leave it
always in common amongſt the whole human Race,
and make no Subdiviſions of Right and Property.
Water and Air, tho' the moſt neceſſary of all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
are not challeng'd by Individuals; nor can
any one commit Injuſtice by the moſt laviſh Uſe and
Enjoyment of theſe Bleſſings. In fertile, extenſive
Countries, with few Inhabitants, Land is regarded
on the ſame Footing. And no Topic is ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on by thoſe, who defend the Liberty of the
Seas, as the unexhauſted Uſe of them in Navigation.
Were the Advantages, procur'd by Navigation, as
inexhauſtible, theſe Reaſoners never had had any
Adverſaries to refute; nor had any Claims been ever
advanc'd of a ſeparate, excluſive Dominion over the
Ocean.</p>
               <p>IT may happen in ſome Countries, at ſome Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods,
that there be eſtabliſh'd a Property in Water,

                     <hi>Geneſis,</hi> chap. xiii, and xxi.</note>; if the latter be in greater Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0352600600:38"/>
AGAIN; ſuppoſe, that, tho' the Neceſſities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Race continue the ſame as at preſent, yet the
Mind is ſo enlarg'd, and ſo replete with Friendſhip
and Generoſity, that every Man has the utmoſt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
for every Man, and feels no more Concern
for his own Intereſt than for that of his Fellow: It
ſeems evident, that the USE of Juſtice would, in
this Caſe, be ſuſpended by ſuch an extenſive Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,
nor would the Diviſions and Barriers of
Property and Obligation have ever been thought of.
Why ſhould I bind another, by a Deed or Promiſe,
to do me any Good-office, when I know he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
prompted, by the ſtrongeſt Inclination,
to ſeek my Happineſs, and would, of himſelf, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the deſir'd Service; except the Hurt, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
receives, be greater than the Benefit accruing to
me: In which Caſe, he knows, that, from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Humanity and Friendſhip, I ſhould be the firſt
to oppoſe myſelf to his imprudent Generoſity?
Why raiſe Land-marks betwixt my Neighbour's
Field and mine, when my Heart has made no Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
betwixt our Intereſts; but ſhares all his Joys and
Sorrows with equal Force and Vivacity as if origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
my own? Every Man, upon this Suppoſition,
being a Second-ſelf to another, would truſt all his
Intereſts to the Diſcretion of every Man, without
Jealouſy, without Partition, without Diſtinction.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0352600600:39"/>
And the whole Race of Mankind would form only
one Family; where all lay in common, and was
us'd, freely, without Regard to Property; but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
too, with as entire Regard to the Neceſſities
of each Individual, as if our own Intereſts were moſt
intimately concern'd.</p>
               <p>IN the preſent Diſpoſition of the human Heart,
'twould, perhaps, be difficult to find compleat In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of ſuch enlarg'd Affections; but ſtill we may
obſerve, that the Caſe of Families approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it; and the ſtronger is the mutual Benevolence
amongſt the Individuals, the nearer it approaches;
till all Diſtinction of Property be, in a great
Meaſure, loſt and confounded amongſt them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
marry'd Perſons, the Cement of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is by the Laws ſuppos'd ſo ſtrong as to
aboliſh all Diviſion of Poſſeſſions; and has often,
in Reality, the Force aſcribed to it. And 'tis
obſervable, that, during the Ardour of new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms,
where every Principle is inflam'd into
Extravagance, the Community of Goods has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
been attempted; and nothing but Experience
of its Inconveniencies, from the returning or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
Selfiſhneſs of Men, could make the imprudent
Fanatics adopt a-new the Ideas of Juſtice and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Property. So true is it, that that Virtue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0352600600:40"/>
its Exiſtence altogether from its neceſſary <hi>Uſe</hi> to
the Intercourſe and Society of Mankind.</p>
               <p>To make this Truth more evident, let us reverſe
the foregoing Suppoſitions; and carrying every
Thing to the oppoſite Extreme, conſider what would
be the Effect of theſe new Situations. Suppoſe a
Society to fall into ſuch Want of all common Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
that the utmoſt Frugality and Induſtry can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
preſerve the greateſt Number from periſhing,
and the whole from extreme Sufferance: It will
readily, I believe, be admitted, that the ſtrict Laws
of Juſtice are ſuſpended, in ſuch a preſſing Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and give Place to the ſtronger Motives of
Neceſſity and Self-preſervation. Is it any Crime,
after a Shipwreck, to ſeize whatever Means or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of Safety one can lay hold of, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to former Limitations of Property? Or if a
City beſieg'd were ſtarving with Hunger; can we
imagine, that Men will ſee any Means of Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and periſh, from a ſcrupulous Regard to
what, in other Situations, would be the Rules of
Equity and Juſtice? The USE and TENDENCY
of that Virtue is to procure Happineſs and Security,
by preſerving Order in Society: But where the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
is ready to periſh from extreme Neceſſity, no
greater Evil can be dreaded from Violence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and every Man may now provide for himſelf,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0352600600:41"/>
by all Means, which Prudence can dictate, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
permit. The Public, even in leſs urgent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
open Granaries, without the Conſent of
Proprietors; as juſtly ſuppoſing, that the Authority
of Magiſtracy may, conſiſtent with Equity, extend
ſo far: But were any Number of Men to aſſemble,
without the Tye of Laws or civil Juriſdiction;
would an equal Partition of Bread in a Famine,
even without the Proprietor's Conſent, be regarded
as criminal or injurious?</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE alſo, that it ſhould be a virtuous Man's
Fate to fall into the Society of Ruffians, remote
from the Protection of Laws and Government;
what Conduct muſt he embrace in that melancholy
Situation? He ſees ſuch a deſperate Rapaciouſneſs
prevail; ſuch a Diſregard to Equity, ſuch Contempt
of Order, ſuch ſtupid Blindneſs to future Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
as muſt immediately have the moſt tragical
Concluſion, and muſt terminate in Deſtruction to
the greater Number, and in a total Diſſolution of
Society to the reſt. He, mean while, can have no
other Expedient, than to arm himſelf, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Sword he ſeizes, or the Buckler may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long:
Make Proviſion of all Means of Defence and
Security: And his particular Regard to Juſtice being
no longer of USE to his own Safety or that of
others, he muſt conſult alone the Dictates of Self-preſervation,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0352600600:42"/>
without Concern for thoſe, who no
longer merit his Care and Attention.</p>
               <p>WHEN any Man, even in political Society, renders
himſelf, by his Crimes, obnoxious to the Public, he
is puniſh'd by the Laws in his Goods and Perſon;
that is, the ordinary Rules of Juſtice are, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to him, ſuſpended for a Moment, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
equitable to inflict on him, for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of
Society, what, otherwiſe, he could not ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Wrong or Injury.</p>
               <p>THE Rage and Violence of public War; what
is it but a Suſpenſion of Juſtice amongſt the warring.
Parties, who perceive, that that Virtue is now no
longer of any <hi>Uſe</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> to them? The Laws
of War, which then ſucceed to thoſe of Equity and
Juſtice, are Rules calculated for the <hi>Advantage</hi> and
<hi>Utility</hi> of that particular State, in which Men are now
plac'd. And were a civiliz'd Nation engag'd with
Barbarians, who obſerv'd no Rules even of War;
the former muſt alſo ſuſpend their Obſervance of
them, where they no longer ſerve to any Purpoſe;
and muſt render every Action or Rencounter as
bloody and pernicious as poſſible to the firſt Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0352600600:43"/>
THUS the Rules of Equity or Juſtice depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
on the particular State and Condition, in
which Men are plac'd, and owe their Origin and
Exiſtence to that UTILITY, which reſults to
the Public from their ſtrict and regular Obſervance.
Reverſe, in any conſiderable Circumſtance, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Men: Produce extreme Abundance or
extreme Neceſſity: Implant in the human Breaſt
perfect Moderation and Humanity, or perfect Rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
and Malice: By rendering Juſtice totally
<hi>uſeleſs,</hi> you thereby totally deſtroy its Eſſence, and
ſuſpend its Obligation upon Mankind.</p>
               <p>THE common Situation of Society is a Medium
amidſt all theſe Extremes. We are naturally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to Ourſelves, and to our Friends; but are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of learning the Advantage, reſulting from a
more equal Conduct. Few Enjoyments are given
us from the open and liberal Hand of Nature; but
by Art, Labour, and Induſtry, we can extract them
in great Abundance. Hence the Ideas of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
become neceſſary in all civil Society: Hence
Juſtice derives its Uſefulneſs to the Public: And
hence alone ariſes its Merit and moral Obligation.</p>
               <p>THESE Concluſions are ſo natural and obvious,
that they have not eſcap'd even the Poets, in their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0352600600:44"/>
Deſcriptions of the Felicity, attending the Golden
Age or the Reign of <hi>Saturn.</hi> The Seaſons, in that
firſt Period of Nature, were ſo temperate, if we
credit theſe agreeable Fictions, that there was no
Neceſſity for Men to provide themſelves with Cloaths
and Houſes, as a Security againſt the Violence of
Heat and Cold: The Rivers flow'd with Wine and
Milk: The Oaks yielded Honey; and Nature
ſpontaneouſly produc'd her greateſt Delicacies. Nor
were theſe the chief Advantages of that happy Age.
The Storms and Tempeſts were not alone remov'd
from Nature; but thoſe more furious Tempeſts were
unknown to human Breaſts, which now cauſe ſuch
Uproar, and engender ſuch Confuſion. Avarice,
Ambition, Cruelty, Selfiſhneſs were never heard of:
Cordial Affection, Compaſſion, Sympathy were the
only Movements, with which the Mind was yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.
Even the punctilious Diſtinction of <hi>Mine</hi>
and <hi>Thine</hi> was baniſh'd from amongſt that happy
Race of Mortals, and carry'd with it the very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Property and Obligation, Juſtice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>poetical</hi> Fiction of the <hi>Golden Age</hi> is, in ſome
Reſpects, of a Piece with the <hi>philoſophical</hi> Fiction
of the <hi>State of Nature;</hi> only that the former is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as the moſt charming and moſt peaceable
Condition, that can poſſibly be imagin'd; whereas the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0352600600:45"/>
latter is pointed out as a State of mutual War and
Violence, attended with the moſt extreme Neceſſity.
On the firſt Origin of Mankind, as we are told, their
Ignorance and ſavage Nature were ſo prevalent,
that they could give no mutual Truſt, but muſt each
depend upon himſelf, and his own Force or Cunning
for Protection and Security. No Law was heard of:
No Rule of Juſtice known: No Diſtinction of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

WHETHER ſuch a Condition of human Nature
could ever exiſt, or if it did, could continue ſo long
as to merit the Appellation of a <hi>State,</hi> may juſtly be
doubted. Men are neceſſarily born in a Family-ſociety,
at leaſt; and are train'd up by their Parents
to ſome Rule of Conduct and Behaviour. But this
muſt be admitted, that if ſuch a State of mutual
War and Violence was ever real, the Suſpenſion of
all Laws of Juſtice, from their abſolute Inutility, is
a neceſſary and infallible Conſequence.</p>
               <p>THE more we vary our Views of human Life,
and the newer and more unuſual the Lights are, in
which we ſurvey it, the more ſhall we be convinc'd,
that the Origin here aſſign'd for the Virtue of Juſtice
is real and ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>WERE there a Species of Creatures, intermingied
with Men, which, tho' rational, were poſſeſt of ſuch
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0352600600:47"/>
inferior Strength, both of Body and Mind, that
they were incapable of all Reſiſtance, and could
never, upon the higheſt Provocation, make us feel
the Effects of their Reſentment; the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
I think, is, that we ſhould be bound, by
the Laws of Humanity, to give gentle Uſage to
theſe Creatures, but ſhould not, properly ſpeaking,
lie under any Reſtraint of Juſtice with Regard to
them, nor could they poſſeſs any Right or Property,
excluſive of ſuch arbitrary Lords. Our Intercourſe
with them could not be call'd Society, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
a Degree of Equality; but abſolute Command
on the one Side, and ſervile Obedience on the other.
Whatever we covet, they muſt inſtantly reſign: Our
Permiſſion is the only Tenure, by which they hold
their Poſſeſſions: Our Compaſſion and Kindneſs the
only Check, by which they curb our lawleſs Will:
And as no Inconvenience ever reſults from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of a Power, ſo firmly eſtabliſh'd in Nature,
the Reſtraints of Juſtice and Property, being totally
<hi>uſeleſs,</hi> would never have Place, in ſo unequal a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.</p>
               <p>THIS is plainly the Situation of Men with regard
to Animals; and how far theſe may be ſaid to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
Reaſon, I leave it to others to determine. The

the ſame Footing with regard to them, and made us
throw off all Reſtraints of Juſtice, and even of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
in our Treatment of them. In many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the female Sex are reduc'd to like Slavery,
and are render'd incapable of all Property, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to their lordly Maſters. But tho' the Males,
when united, have, in all Countries, brute Force
ſufficient to maintain this ſevere Tyranny; yet ſuch
are the Inſinuation, Addreſs, and Charms of their
fair Companions, that they are commonly able to
break the Confederacy, and ſhare with the ſuperior
Sex in all the Rights and Privileges of Society.</p>
               <p>WERE the human Species ſo fram'd by Nature as
that each Individual poſſeſt within himſelf every
Faculty, requiſite both for his own Preſervation and
for the Propagation of his Kind: Were all Society
and Intercourſe cut off betwixt Man and Man, by the
primary Intention of the ſupreme Creator: It ſeems
evident, that ſo ſolitary a Being would be as much
incapable of Juſtice, as of ſocial Diſcourſe and
Converſation. Where mutual Regards and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
ſerve no Manner of Purpoſe, they would
never direct the Conduct of any reaſonable Man.
The headlong Courſe of the Paſſions would be
check'd by no Reflection on future Conſequences.
And as each Man is here ſuppos'd to love himſelf
alone, and to depend only on himſelf and his own
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0352600600:49"/>
Activity for Safety and Happineſs, he would, on
every Occaſion, to the utmoſt of his Power, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the Preference above every other Being, to
whom he is not bound by any Ties, either of Nature
or of Intereſt.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſe the Conjunction of the Sexes to be
eſtabliſh'd in Nature, a Family immediately ariſes;
and particular Rules being found requiſite for its
Subſiſtance, theſe are immediately embrac'd; tho'
without comprehending the reſt of Mankind within
their Preſcriptions. Suppoſe, that ſeveral Families
unite together into one Society, which is totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd
from all others, the Rules, which preſerve
Peace and Order, enlarge themſelves to the utmoſt
Extent of that Society; but, being entirely uſeleſs,
loſe their Force when carry'd one Step farther. But
again ſuppoſe, that ſeveral diſtinct Societies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Kind of Entercourſe for mutual Convenience
and Advantage, the Boundaries of Juſtice ſtill grow
larger and larger, in Proportion to the Largeneſs of
Men's Views, and the Force of their mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions.

               <p>IF we examine all the <hi>particular</hi> Laws, by which
Juſtice is directed, and Property determin'd; we
ſhall ſtill be preſented with the ſame Concluſion.
The Good of Mankind is the only Object of all
theſe Laws and Regulations. Not only 'tis requiſite,
for the Peace and Intereſt of Society, that Men's
Poſſeſſions ſhould be ſeparated; but the Rules,
which we follow in making the Separation, are ſuch
as can beſt be contriv'd to ſerve farther the Intereſts
of Society.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall ſuppoſe, that a Creature, poſſeſt of
Reaſon, but unacquainted with human Nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates
with himſelf what RULES of Juſtice or
Property would beſt promote public Intereſt, and
eſtabliſh Peace and Security amongſt Mankind:
His moſt obvious Thought would be, to aſſign the
largeſt Poſſeſſions to the moſt extenſive Virtue, and
give every one the Power of doing Good, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to his Inclination. In a perfect Theocracy,
where a Being, infinitely intelligent, governs by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Volitions, this Rule would certainly have
Place, and might ſerve the wiſeſt Purpoſes: But
were Mankind to execute ſuch a Law; (ſo great is
the Uncertainty of Merit, both from its natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0352600600:51"/>
and from the Self-conceit of each Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual)
that no determinate Rule of Conduct would
ever reſult from it; and the total Diſſolution of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
muſt be the immediate Conſequence. Fanatics
may ſuppoſe, <hi>that Dominion is founded in Grace,</hi> and
<hi>that Saints alone inherit the Earth;</hi> but the civil
Magiſtrate very juſtly puts theſe ſublime Theoriſts
on the ſame Footing with common Robbers, and
teaches them, by the ſevereſt Diſcipline, that a Rule,
which, in Speculation, may ſeem the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to Society, may yet be found, in Practice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
pernicious and deſtructive.</p>
               <p>THAT there were <hi>religious</hi> Fanatics of this kind in
<hi>England,</hi> during the civil Wars, we learn from
Hiſtory; tho' 'tis probable, that the obvious <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
of theſe Principles excited ſuch Horrour in
Mankind, as ſoon oblig'd the dangerous Enthuſiaſts
to renounce, or at leaſt conceal their Tenets. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
the <hi>Levellers,</hi> who claim'd an equal Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Property, were a Kind of <hi>political</hi> Fanatics,
which aroſe from the religious Species, and more
openly avow'd their Pretenſions, as carrying a more
plauſible Appearance, of being practicable, as well
as uſeful to human Society.</p>
               <p>IT muſt, indeed, be confeſt, that Nature is ſo
liberal to Mankind, that were all her Preſents equally
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0352600600:52"/>
divided amongſt the Species, and improv'd by Art
and Induſtry, every Individual would enjoy all the
Neceſſaries, and even moſt of the Comforts of Life;
nor would ever be liable to any Ills, but ſuch as
might accidentally ariſe from the ſickly Frame and
Conſtitution of his Body. It muſt alſo be confeſt,
that, wherever we depart from this Equality, we
rob the Poor of more Satisfaction than we add to
the Rich, and that the ſlight Gratification of a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
Vanity, in one Individual, frequently coſts
more than Bread to many Families, and even Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
It may appear withal, that the Rule of
Equality, as it would be highly <hi>uſeful,</hi> is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>impracticable;</hi> but has taken Place, at leaſt, in
an imperfect Degree, in ſome Republics; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
that of <hi>Sparta;</hi> where it was attended, as 'tis
ſaid, with the moſt beneficial Conſequences. Not
to mention, that the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, ſo frequently
claim'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> and carry'd to Execution in many
<hi>Greek</hi> Cities, proceeded, all of them, from a general
Idea of the Utility of this Principle.</p>
               <p>But Hiſtorians, and even common Senſe, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, that, however ſpecious theſe Ideas of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
Equality may ſeem, they are really, at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<hi>impracticable;</hi> and were they not ſo, would be
extremely <hi>pernicious</hi> to human Society. Render the
Poſſeſſions of Men ever ſo equal, their different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0352600600:53"/>
of Art, Care, and Induſtry will immediately
break that Equality. Or if you check theſe Virtues,
you reduce Society to the extremeſt Indigence; and
inſtead of preventing Want and Beggary in a few,
render it unavoidable to the whole Community.
The moſt rigorous Inquiſition too, is requiſite to
watch every Inequality on its firſt Appearance; and
the moſt ſevere Juriſdiction, to puniſh and redreſs it.
But beſides, that ſo much Authority muſt ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into Tyranny, and be exerted with great
Partialities; who can poſſibly be poſſeſt of it, in
ſuch a Situation as is here ſuppos'd? Perfect Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Poſſeſſions, deſtroying all Subordination,
weakens extremely the Authority of Magiſtracy, and
muſt reduce all Power nearly to a Level, as well as
Property.</p>
               <p>WE may conclude, therefore, that, in order to
eſtabliſh Laws for the Regulation of Property, we
muſt be acquainted with the Nature and Situation
of Man, muſt reject Appearances, which may be
falſe, tho' ſpecious, and muſt ſearch for thoſe Rules,
which are, on the whole, moſt <hi>uſeful,</hi> and <hi>beneficial,</hi>
Vulgar Senſe and ſlight Experience are ſufficient for
this Purpoſe; where Men give not way to too ſelfiſh
Avidity, or too extenſive Enthuſiaſm.</p>

WHO ſees not, for Inſtance, that whatever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
or improv'd by a Man's Art or Induſtry ought,
for ever, to be ſecur'd to him, in order to give En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to ſuch <hi>uſeful</hi> Habits and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
That the Property ought alſo to deſcend to
Children and Relations, for the ſame <hi>uſeful</hi> Purpoſe?
That it may be alienated by Conſent, in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that Commerce and Intercourſe, which is ſo <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial</hi>
to human Society? And that all Contracts
and Promiſes ought carefully to be fulfill'd, in order
to ſecure mutual Truſt and Confidence, by which
the general <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Mankind is ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted?</p>
               <p>EXAMINE the Writers on the Laws of Nature;
and you will always find, that, whatever Principles
they ſet out with, they are ſure to terminate here at
laſt, and to aſſign, as the ultimate Reaſon for every
Rule they eſtabliſh, the Convenience and Neceſſities
of Mankind. A Conceſſion thus extorted, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Syſtems, has more Authority, than if it
had been made, in Proſecution of them.</p>
               <p>WHAT other Reaſon, indeed, could Writers ever
give, why this muſt be <hi>mine</hi> and that <hi>yours;</hi> ſince
uninſtructed Nature, ſurely, never made any ſuch
Diſtinction? Theſe Objects are, of themſelves,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0352600600:55"/>
foreign to us; they are totally disjoin'd and ſeparate;
and nothing but the general Intereſts of Society can
form the Connection.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES, the Intereſts of Society may require
a Rule of Juſtice in a particular Caſe; but may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
determine any particular Rule, amongſt ſeveral,
which are all equally beneficial. In that Caſe, the
ſlighteſt <hi>Analogies</hi> are laid hold of, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
that Indifference and Ambiguity, which would
be the Source of perpetual Quarrels and Diſſentions.
Thus Poſſeſſion alone, and firſt Poſſeſſion, is ſuppos'd
to convey Property, where no-body elſe has any
precedent Claim and Pretenſion. Many of the
Reaſonings of Lawyers are of this analogical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and depend on very ſlight Connexions of the
Imagination.</p>
               <p>Is it ever ſcrupled, in extraordinary Caſes, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
all Regard to the private Property of Individuals,
and ſacrifice to public Intereſt a Diſtinction, which
had been eſtabliſh'd for the Sake of that Intereſt?
The Safety of the People is the ſupreme Law: All
other particular Laws are ſubordinate to it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
on it: And if, in the <hi>common</hi> Courſe of
Things, they be followed and regarded; 'tis only
becauſe the public Safety and Intereſt, <hi>commonly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſo equal and impartial an Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0352600600:56"/>
SOMETIMES both <hi>Utility</hi> and <hi>Analogy</hi> fail, and leave
the Laws of Juſtice in total Uncertainty. Thus,
'tis highly requiſite, that Preſcription or long Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
ſhould convey Property; but what Number
of Days or Months or Years ſhould be ſufficient for
that Purpoſe, 'tis impoſſible for Reaſon alone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
<hi>Civil Laws</hi> here ſupply the Place of the
natural <hi>Code,</hi> and aſſign different Terms for Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the different <hi>Utilities,</hi> propos'd
by the Legiſlator. Bills of Exchange and promiſſory
Notes, by the Laws of moſt Countries, preſcribe
ſooner than Bonds and Mortgages, and Contracts of
a more formal Nature.</p>
               <p>IN general we may obſerve, that all Queſtions of
Property are ſubordinate to the Authority of civil
Laws, which extend, reſtrain, modify, and alter
the Rules of natural Juſtice, according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Convenience</hi> of each Community. The Laws
have, or ought to have, a conſtant Reference to the
Conſtitution of Government, the Manners, the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
the Religion, the Commerce, the Situation of
each Society. A late Author of great Genius, as
well as extenſive Learning, has proſecuted this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
at large, and has eſtabliſh'd, from theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
the beſt Syſtem of political Knowledge, that,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0352600600:57"/>
perhaps, has ever yet been communicated to the
World<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Author of <hi>L'Eſprit des Loix.</hi> This illuſtrious Writer, however, ſets out with a different Theory, and ſuppoſes all Right to be founded on certain <hi>Rapports</hi> or Relations; which is a Syſtem, that, in my Opinion, never will reconcile with true Philoſophy. Father <hi>Malebranche,</hi> as far as I can learn, was the firſt, that ſtarted this abſtract Theory of Morals, which was afterwards adopted by Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi> and others; and as it excludes all Sentiment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to found every Thing on Reaſon, it has not wanted Followers in this philoſophic Age. See <hi>Eſſay</hi> 1. and <hi>Appendix</hi> 1. With 1 gard to Juſtice, the Virtue here treated of, the Inference againſt this Theory ſeems ſhort and concluſive. Property is allow'd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on civil Laws: Civil Laws are allow'd to have no Object but the Intereſt of Society: This therefore muſt be allow'd to be the ſole Foundation of Property and Juſtice. Not to mention, that our Obligation itſelf to obey the Magiſtrate and his Laws is founded on nothing but the Intereſts of Society.</p>
                     <p>If the Ideas of Juſtice, ſometimes, do not follow the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of civil Law; we ſhall find, that theſe Caſes, inſtead of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, are Confirmations of the Theory deliver'd above. Where a civil Law is ſo perverſe as to croſs all the Intereſts of Society, it loſes all its Authority, and Men judge by the Ideas of natural Juſtice, which are conformable to thoſe Intereſts. Sometimes alſo civil Laws, for uſeful Purpoſes, require a Ceremony or Form; and where that is wanting, their Decrees run contrary to the uſual Tenor of Juſtice; but one, who takes Advantage of ſuch Chicanes, is not regarded as an honeſt Man. Thus, the Intereſts of Society require, that Contracts be fulfill'd; and there is not a more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Article either of natural or civil Juſtice: But the Omiſſion of a trifling Circumſtance will often, by Law, invalidate a Contract, <hi>in foro humano,</hi> but not <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> as Divines expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In theſe Caſes, the Magiſtrate is ſuppos'd only to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Power of enforcing the Right, not to have alter'd the Right. Where his Intention extends to the Right, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Intereſts of Society; it never fails to alter the Right; a clear Proof of the Origin of Juſtice and of Property, as aſſign'd above.</p>

               <p>THOSE, who ridicule vulgar Superſtitions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0352600600:59"/>
not have approach'd Bacon: But if theſe Species of
Food be examin'd by the Senſes of Sight, Smell or

Medicine, or Phyſics; no Difference is ever found
betwixt them and any other Species, nor can that
preciſe Circumſtance be pitch'd on, which may afford
a juſt Foundation for the religious Paſſion. A Fowl
on Thurſday is lawful Food; on Friday, abominable:
Eggs in this Houſe, and in this Dioceſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

Such Reflections, as theſe, in the Mouth of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,

not, of themſelves, they are ſurely obſtructed by
Education, Prejudice and Paſſion, not by Ignorance
or Miſtake.</p>
               <p>IT may appear, to a careleſs View; or rather, a
too abſtracted Reflection; that there enters a like
Superſtition into all the Regards of Juſtice; and that,
if a Man ſubjects its Objects, or what we call Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
to the ſame Scrutiny of Senſe and Science, he
will not, by the moſt accurate Enquiry, find
any Foundation for the Difference made by moral

Tree; but the Fruit of another of the ſame Species,
ten Paces off, 'tis criminal for me to touch. Had I

Uſe and Service. Were this Houſe plac'd in the
neighbouring Territory, it had been immoral for me
to dwell in it; but being built on this Side the River,
it is ſubject to a different municipal Law, and I incur
no Blame or Cenſure. The ſame Species of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it may be thought, which ſo ſucceſsfully expoſes
Superſtition, is alſo applicable to Juſtice; nor is it
poſſible, in the one Caſe more than in the other, to
point out, in the Object, that preciſe Quality or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,

The Expreſſion, being once brought in as ſubſervient to the Will, ſoon becomes the principal Part of the Promiſe; nor will a Man be leſs bound by his Word, tho' he ſecretly give a different Direction to his Intention, and with hold the Aſſent of his Mind. But tho' the Expreſſion makes, on moſt Occaſions, the whole of the Promiſe, yet it does not always ſo; and one, who ſhould make uſe of any Expreſſion, of which he knows not the Meaning, and which he uſes without any Senſe of the Conſequences, would not certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he know its Meaning, yet if he uſes it in Jeſt only, and with ſuch Signs as ſhow evidently, he has no ſerious Intention of binding himſelf, he would not lie under any Obligation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; but 'tis neceſſary, that the Words be a perfect Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Will, without any contrary Signs. Nay, even this we muſt not carry ſo far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our Quickneſs of Underſtanding, we conjecture, from certain Signs, to have an Intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or verbal Promiſe, if we accept of it; but muſt limit this Concluſion to thoſe Caſes, where the Signs are of a different Nature from thoſe of Deceit. All thoſe Contradictions are eaſily accounted for, if Juſtice ariſes entirely from its Uſefulneſs to Society; but will never be explain'd on any other Hypotheſis.</note>

            <p>HAD every Man ſufficient <hi>Sagacity</hi> to perceive,
at all Times, the ſtrong Intereſt, which binds
him to the Obſervance of Juſtice and Equity, and
<hi>Strength of Mind</hi> ſufficient to perſevere in a ſteady
Adherence to a general and a diſtant Intereſt, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Allurements of preſent Pleaſure and
Advantage: There had never, in that Caſe, been
any ſuch Thing as Government or political Society,
but each Man following his natural Liberty, had
liv'd in entire Peace and Harmony with all others.
What Need of poſitive Laws, where natural Juſtice
is, of itſelf, a ſufficient Reſtraint? Why create
Magiſtrates, where there never ariſes any Diſorder
or Iniquity? Why abridge our native Freedom,
when, in every Inſtance, the utmoſt Exertion of it is
found innocent and beneficial? 'Tis evident, that, if
Government were totally uſeleſs, it never could have
Place, and that the SOLE Foundation of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0352600600:65"/>
Duty of ALLEGIANCE is the <hi>Advantage</hi>
which it procures to Society, by preſerving Peace and
Order amongſt Mankind.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Number of political Societies are erected,
and maintain a great Entercourſe together; a new Set
of Rules are immediately diſcover'd to be <hi>uſeful</hi> in
that particular Situation; and accordingly take place,
under the Title of LAWS of NATIONS.
Of this Kind are, the Sacredneſs of the Perſons of
Ambaſſadors, abſtaining from poiſon'd Arms, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in War, with others of that Kind; which are
plainly calculated for the <hi>Advantage</hi> of States and
Kingdoms, in their Entercourſe with each other.</p>
            <p>THE Rules of Juſtice, ſuch as prevail amongſt
Individuals, are not altogether ſuſpended amongſt
political Societies. All Princes pretend a Regard to
the Rights of others; and ſome, no doubt, without
Hypocriſy. Alliances and Treaties are every Day
made betwixt independent States, which would only
be ſo much Waſte of Parchment, if they were not
found, by Experience, to have <hi>ſome</hi> Influence and
Authority. But here is the Difference betwixt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Individuals. Human Nature cannot, by
any Means, ſubſiſt, without the Aſſociation of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals;
and that Aſſociation never could have
Place, were no Regard pay'd to the Laws of Equity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0352600600:66"/>
and Juſtice. Diſorder, Confuſion, the War of All
againſt All are the neceſſary Conſequences of ſuch a
licentious Conduct. But Nations can flouriſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Entercourſe. They may even ſubſiſt, in ſome
Degree, under a general War. The Obſervance of
Juſtice, tho' uſeful among them, is not guarded by
ſo ſtrong a Neceſſity as among Individuals; and the
<hi>moral Obligation</hi> holds Proportion with the <hi>Uſefulneſs.</hi>
All Politicians will allow, and moſt Philoſophers,
that REASONS of STATE may, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Emergencies, diſpence with the Rules of Juſtice,
and invalidate any Treaty or Alliance, where the
ſtrict Obſervance of it would be prejudicial, in a
conſiderable Degree, to either of the contracting
Parties. But nothing leſs than the extremeſt Neceſſity,
'tis confeſt, can juſtify Individuals in a Breach of
Promiſe, or an Invaſion of the Properties of others.</p>
            <p>IN a confederated Commonwealth, ſuch as the
<hi>Achaean</hi> Republic of old, or the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Cantons and
United Provinces in modern Times; as the League
has here a peculiar <hi>Utility,</hi> the Conditions of Union
have a peculiar Sacredneſs and Authority, and a
Violation of them would be equally criminal, or
even more criminal, than any private Injury or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>

THOSE who live in the ſame Family have ſo many

Cuſtom. INCEST, therefore, being <hi>pernicious</hi>
in a ſuperior Degree, has alſo a ſuperior Turpitude
and moral Deformity, annex'd to it.</p>
            <p>WHAT is the Reaſon, why, by the <hi>Greek</hi> Laws,
one might marry a Half-ſiſter by the Father, but not
by the Mother? Plainly this. The Manners of the

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0352600600:71"/>
to approach the Women's Apartment, even in
the ſame Family, unleſs where he viſited his own
Mother. His Step-mother and her Children were as
much ſhut up from him as the Women of any other
Family, and there was as little Danger of any crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Intercourſe betwixt them: Uncles and Nieces,
for a like Reaſon, might marry at <hi>Athens;</hi> but neither
theſe nor Half-brothers and Siſters could contract that
Alliance at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Intercourſe was more
open betwixt the Sexes. Public Utility is the Cauſe
of all theſe Variations.</p>
            <p>To repeat, to a Man's Prejudice, any Thing that
eſcap'd him in private Converſation, or to make any
ſuch Uſe of his private Letters, is highly blam'd.
The free and ſocial Intercourſe of Minds muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
checkt, where no ſuch Rules of Fidelity are
eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p>EVEN in repeating Stories, whence we can ſee no
ill Conſequences to reſult, the giving one's Authors is
regarded as a Piece of Indiſcretion, if not of Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
Theſe Stories, in paſſing from Hand to Hand,
and receiving all the uſual Variations, frequently

To pry into Secrets, to open or even read the

more blameable?</p>
            <p>THIS Principle is alſo the Foundation of moſt of

But in Places of general, tho' caſual Concourſe,
where Health and Pleaſure bring People promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
together, public Conveniency has diſpens'd
with this Maxim; and Cuſtom there promotes an

EVEN in Societies, that are eſtabliſh'd on Principles
the moſt immoral, and the moſt deſtructive to the
Intereſts of the general Society, there are requir'd
certain Rules and Maxims, which a Species of falſe
Honour, as well as private Intereſt, engages the
Members to obſerve. Robbers and Pyrates, it has
often been remark'd, could not maintain their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Confederacy, did they not eſtabliſh a new
diſtributive Juſtice amongſt themſelves, and recall
thoſe Laws of Equity, which they have violated

            <p>AMONGST Nations, where an immoral Gallantry,
if cover'd with a thin Veil of Myſtery, is, in ſome
Degree, authoriz'd by Cuſtom, there immediately
ariſe a Set of Rules, calculated for the Conveniency
of that Attachment. The famous Court or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0352600600:74"/>
in each Game. The Foundation, I own, of
ſuch Societies is frivolous; and the Laws are, in a
great Meaſure, tho' not altogether, capricious and
arbitrary. So far is there a material Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and the Rules of Juſtice, Fidelity and
Loyalty. The general Societies of Men are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
requiſite for the Subſiſtence of the Species;
and the public Conveniency, which regulates Morals,
is inviolably eſtabliſh'd in the Nature of Man, and of
the World, in which he lives. The Compariſon,
therefore, in theſe Reſpects, is very imperfect. We
may only learn from it the Neceſſity of Rules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Men have any Intercourſe with each other.</p>
            <p>THEY cannot even paſs each other on the Road
without Rules. Waggoners, Coachmen, and Poſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
have Principles, by which they give way; and
theſe are chiefly founded on mutual Eaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
Sometimes alſo they are arbitrary, or at
beſt dependant on a Kind of capricious Analogy,
like many of the Reaſonings of Lawyers<note n="*" place="bottom">That the lighter Machine yields to the heavier, and in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of the ſame Kind, that the empty yield to the loaded; this Rule is founded on Convenience. That thoſe who are going to the Capital take place of thoſe who are coming from it; this ſeems to be ſounded on ſome Idea of the Dignity of the great City, and of the Preference of the future to the paſt.

To carry the Matter farther, we may obſerve, that
'tis impoſſible for Men ſo much as to murther each
other without Statutes and Maxims, and an Idea of

Utility the Praiſe which we beſtow on the ſocial
Virtues, that one would expect to meet with this
Principle every-where in moral Writers, as the chief
Foundation of their Reaſoning and Inquiry. In
common Life, we may obſerve, that the Circumſtance
of Utility is always appeal'd to; nor is it ſuppos'd,
that a greater Elogy can be given to any Man, than
to diſplay his Uſefulneſs to the Public, and enumerate
the Services he has perform'd to Mankind and Society.
What Praiſe, even of an inanimate Form, if the
Regularity and Elegance of its Parts deſtroy not its
Fitneſs for any uſeful Purpoſe! And how ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
an Apology for any Diſproportion of ſeeming
Deformity, if we can ſhow the Neceſſity of that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0352600600:77"/>
particular Conſtruction for the Uſe intended! A
Ship appears infinitely more beautiful to an Artiſt,
or one moderately ſkill'd in Navigation; where its
Prow is wide and ſwelling beyond its Poop, than if it
were fram'd with a preciſe geometrical Regularity,
in Contradiction to all the Laws of Mechanics. A
Building, whoſe Doors and Windows were exact
Squares, would hurt the Eye by that very Proportion;
as ill adapted to the human Figure, for whoſe Service
the Fabric was intended What Wonder then, that
a Man, whoſe Habits and Conduct are hurtful to
Society, and dangerous or pernicious to every one,
that has an Intercourſe with him, ſhould, on that
Account, be an Object of Diſapprobation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to every Spectator the ſtrongeſt Sentiments
of Diſguſt and Hatred<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>We ought not to imagine, becauſe an inanimate Object may be uſeful as well as a Man, that therefore it ought alſo, according to this Syſtem, to merit the Appellation of <hi>virtuous.</hi> The Sentiments, excited by Utility, are, in the two Caſes, very different; and the one is mixt with Affection, Eſteem, Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not the other. In like Manner, an inanimate Object may have good Colour and Proportions as well as a human Figure. But can we ever be in Love with the former? There are a numerous Set of Paſſions and Sentiments, of which think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rational Beings are, by the original Conſtitution of Nature, the only proper Objects: And tho' the very ſame Qualities be transferr'd to an inſenſible, inanimate Being, they will not excite the ſame Sentiments. The beneficial Qualities of Herbs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are, indeed, ſometimes call'd their <hi>Virtues;</hi> but this is an Effect of the Caprice of Language, which ought not to be regarded in Reaſoning. For tho' there be a Species of Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, attending even inanimate Objects, when beneficial, yet this Sentiment is ſo weak, and ſo different from what is directed to beneficent Magiſtrates or Stateſmen, that they ought not to be rank'd under the ſame Claſs or Appellation.</p>
                     <p>A very ſmall Variation of the Object, even where the ſame Qualities are preſerv'd, will deſtroy a Sentiment. Thus; the ſame Beauty, transferr'd to a different Sex, excites no amorous Paſſion, where Nature is not extremely perverted.</p>

Effects of Uſefulneſs, or its contrary, has kept Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
from admitting them into their Syſtems of
Ethics, and has induc'd them rather to employ any
other Principle, in explaining the Origin of moral
Good and Evil. But 'tis no juſt Reaſon for rejecting
any Principle, confirm'd by Experience, that we can
give no ſatisfactory Account of its Origin, nor are
able to reſolve it into other more general Principles.
And if we would employ a little Thought on the
preſent Subject, we need be at no Loſs to account for
the Influence of Utility, and to deduce it from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
the moſt known and avow'd in human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0352600600:79"/>
FROM the apparent Uſefulneſs of the ſocial Virtues,
it has readily been inferr'd by Sceptics, both antient
and modern, that all moral Diſtinctions ariſe from
Education, and were, at firſt, invented, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
encourag'd, by the Arts of Politicians, in order
to render Men tractable, and ſubdue their natural
Ferocity and Selfiſhneſs, which incapacitated them
for Society. This Principle, indeed, of Precept and
Education muſt be ſo far own'd to have a powerful
Influence, that it may frequently encreaſe or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
beyond their natural Standard, the Sentiments
of Approbation or Diſlike; and may even, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inſtances, create, without any natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
a new Sentiment of this Kind; as is evident
in all ſuperſtitious Practices and Obſervances: But
that <hi>all</hi> moral Affection or Diſlike ariſes from this
Origin will never ſurely be allow'd by any judicious
Enquirer. Had Nature made no ſuch Diſtinction,
founded on the original Frame and Conſtitution of
the Mind, the Words, <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>ſhameful, lovely</hi>
and <hi>odious, noble</hi> and <hi>deſpicable,</hi> never had had place
in any Language; nor could Politicians, had they
invented theſe Terms, ever have been able to render
them intelligible, or make them convey any Idea to
the Audience. So that nothing can be more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
than this Paradox of the Sceptics; and 'twere
well, if, in the abſtruſer Studies of Logics and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0352600600:80"/>
we could as eaſily get rid of the Cavils of
that Sect, as in the more practical and intelligible
Sciences of Politics and Morals.</p>
               <p>THE ſocial Virtues muſt, therefore, be allow'd to
have a natural Beauty and Amiableneſs, which, at
firſt, antecedent to all Precept or Education, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
them to the Eſteem of uninſtructed Mankind,
and engages their Affections. And as the Utility of
theſe Virtues is the chief Circumſtance, whence they
derive their Merit, it follows, that the End, which
they have a Tendency to promote, muſt be ſome
way agreeable to us, and take hold of ſome natural
Affection. It muſt pleaſe, either from Conſiderations
of Self-intereſt, or from more generous Motives and
Regards.</p>
               <p>IT has often been aſſerted, that, as every Man has
a ſtrong Connexion with Society, and perceives the
Impoſſibility of his ſolitary Subſiſtence, he becomes,
on that Account, favourable to all thoſe Habits or
Principles, which promote Order in Society, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to him the quiet Poſſeſſion of ſo ineſtimable a
Bleſſing. As much as we value our own Happineſs
and Welfare, as much muſt we value the Practice of
Juſtice and Humanity, by which alone the ſocial
Confederacy can be maintain'd, and every Man reap
the Fruits of mutual Protection and Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>

THIS Deduction of Morals from Self-love or a
Regard to private Intereſt, is a very obvious Thought,
and has not ariſen altogether from the wanton Sallies
and ſportive Aſſaults of the Sceptics. To mention
no others, <hi>Polybius,</hi> one of the graveſt, and moſt
judicious, as well as moſt moral Writers of Antiquity,
has aſſign'd this ſelfiſh Origin to all our Sentiments of
Virtue.<note n="*" place="bottom">Undutifulneſs to Parents, is diſapprov'd of by Mankind, <gap reason="foreign">

Author, and his Averſion to all vain Subtilties render
his Authority on the preſent Subject very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
yet this is not an Affair to be decided by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and the Voice of Nature and Experience
ſeems plainly to oppoſe the ſelfiſh Theory.</p>
               <p>WE frequently beſtow Praiſes on virtuous Actions,
perform'd in very diſtant Ages and remote Countries;
where the utmoſt Subtilty of Imagination would not
diſcover any Appearance of Self-intereſt, or find any
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0352600600:82"/>
Connexion of our preſent Happineſs and Security
with Events ſo widely ſeparated from us.</p>
               <p>A generous, a brave, a noble Deed, perform'd by
an Adverſary, commands our Approbation; while
in its Conſequences it may be acknowledged preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to our particular Intereſts.</p>
               <p>WHERE private Advantage concurs with general
Affection for Virtue, we readily perceive and avow
the Mixture of theſe diſtinct Sentiments, which have
a very different Feeling and Influence on the Mind.
We praiſe, perhaps, with more Alacrity, where the
generous, humane Action contributes to our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Intereſt: But the Topics of Praiſe we inſiſt on
are very wide of this Circumſtance. And we may
attempt to bring over others to our Sentiments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
endeavouring to convince them, that they reap
any Advantage from the Actions, which we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to their Approbation and Applauſe.</p>
               <p>FRAME the Model of a praiſe-worthy Character,
conſiſting of all the moſt amiable moral Virtues:
Give Inſtances, in which theſe diſplay themſelves,
after an eminent and extraordinary Manner: You
readily engage the Eſteem and Approbation of all
your Audience, who never ſo much as enquir'd in
what Age and Country the Perſon liv'd, who poſſeſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0352600600:83"/>
theſe noble Qualities: A Circumſtance, however,
of all others, the moſt material to Self-love, or a
Concern for our own individual Happineſs.</p>
               <p>ONCE on a Time, a Stateſmen, in the Shock and
Concurrence of Parties, prevail'd ſo far as to procure,
by his Eloquence, the Baniſhment of an able Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
whom he ſecretly follow'd, offering him.
Money for his Support during his Exile, and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with Topics of Conſolation on his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
<hi>Alas!</hi> cries the baniſh'd Stateſman, <hi>with
what Regret muſt I leave my Friends in this City, where
even Enemies are ſo generous!</hi> Virtue, tho' in an
Enemy, here pleas'd him: And we alſo give it the
juſt Tribute of Praiſe and Approbation; nor do we
retract theſe Sentiments, when we hear, that the
Action paſt at <hi>Athens,</hi> about two thouſand Years ago,
and that the Perſons Names were <hi>Eſchines</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT is that to me?</hi> There are few Occaſions,
when this Queſtion is not pertinent: And had it that
univerſal, infallible Influence ſuppos'd, it would turn
into Ridicule every Compoſition, and almoſt every
Converſation, which contain any Praiſe or Cenſure

'Tis but a weak Subterfuge, when preſs'd by theſe
Facts and Arguments, to ſay, that we tranſport our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by the Force of Imagination, into diſtant
Ages and Countries, and conſider the Advantage,
which we ſhould have reapt from theſe Characters,
had we been Contemporaries, and had any Commerce
with the Perſons. 'Tis not conceivable, how a <hi>real</hi>
Sentiment or Paſſion can ever ariſe from a known
<hi>imaginary</hi> Intereſt; eſpecially when our <hi>real</hi> Intereſt
is ſtill kept in View, and is often acknowledg'd to
be entirely diſtinct from the imaginary, and even
ſometimes oppoſite to it.</p>
               <p>A Man, brought to the Brink of a Precipice,
cannot look down without trembling; and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of <hi>imaginary</hi> Danger actuates him, in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the Opinion and Belief of <hi>real</hi> Safety. But
the Imagination is here aſſiſted by the Preſence of a
ſtriking Object; and yet prevails not, except it be
alſo aided by Novelty, and the unuſual Appearance
of the Object. Cuſtom ſoon reconciles us to Heights
and Precipices, and wears off theſe falſe and deluſive
Terrors. The Reverſe is obſervable in the Eſtimates
we form of Characters and Manners; and the more
we habituate ourſelves to an accurate Scrutiny of
the moral Species, the more delicate Feeling do we
acquire of the moſt minute Diſtinctions betwixt Vice
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0352600600:85"/>
and Virtue. Such frequent Occaſion, indeed, have
we, in common Life, to pronounce all Kinds of
moral Determinations, that no Object of this Kind
can be new or unuſual to us; nor could any <hi>falſe</hi>
Views or Prepoſſeſſions maintain their Ground againſt
an Experience, ſo common and familiar. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Cuſtom being chiefly what form the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations
of Ideas, 'tis impoſſible, that any Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
could eſtabliſh and ſupport itſelf, in direct Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to theſe Principles.</p>
               <p>USEFULNESS is agreeable, and engages our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
This is a Matter of Fact, confirm'd by
daily Obſervation. But, <hi>uſeful?</hi> For what? For
ſome Body's Intereſt, ſurely. Whoſe Intereſt then?
Not our own only: For our Approbation frequently
extends farther. It muſt, therefore, be the Intereſt
of thoſe, who are ſerv'd by the Character or Action
approv'd of; and then we may conclude, however
remote, are not totally indifferent to us. By open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>SELF-LOVE is a Principle in human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſuch extenſive Energy, and the Intereſt
of each Individual is, in general, ſo cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with that of Community, that thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
were excuſable, who fancy'd, that all our
Concern for the Public might, perhaps, be reſolv'd
into a Concern for our own Happineſs and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
They ſaw, every Moment, Inſtances of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
or Blame, Satisfaction or Diſpleaſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Characters and Actions; they denominated the
Objects of theſe Sentiments, <hi>Virtues</hi> or <hi>Vices;</hi> they
obſerv'd, that the former had a Tendency to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Happineſs, and the latter the Miſery of
Society; they aſk'd, if it was poſſible we could have
any general Concern for Society, or any diſintereſted
Reſentment of the Welfare or Injury of others;
they found it ſimpler to conſider all theſe Sentiments
as Modifications of Self-love; and they diſcover'd
a Pretext, at leaſt, for this Unity of Principle, in
that cloſe Union of Intereſt, which is ſo obſervable
betwixt the Public and each Individual.</p>
               <p>BUT notwithſtanding this frequent Confuſion of
Intereſts, 'tis eaſy to attain what natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
after my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> have affected to call
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0352600600:87"/>
the <hi>Experimentum crucis,</hi> or that Experiment, which
points out the Way we ſhould follow, in any Doubt
or Ambiguity. We have found Inſtances, wherein
private Intereſt was ſeparate from public; wherein
it was even contrary: And yet we obſerv'd the
moral Sentiment to continue, notwithſtanding this
Disjunction of Intereſts. And wherever theſe diſtinct
Intereſts ſenſibly concur'd, we always found a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Encreaſe of the Sentiment, and a more warm
Affection to Virtue, and Deteſtation of Vice, or what
we properly call, <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> Compell'd
by theſe Inſtances, we muſt renounce the Theory,
which accounts for every moral Sentiment by the
Principle of Self-love. We muſt adopt a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Affection, and allow, that the Intereſts of Society
are not, even on their own Account, altogether indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to us. Uſefulneſs is only a Tendency to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
End; and 'tis a Contradiction in Terms, that any
Thing pleaſes as Means to an End, where the End
itſelf does no way affect us. If therefore Uſefulneſs
be a Source of moral Sentiment, and if this Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
be not always conſider'd with a Reference to
Self; it follows, that every Thing, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to the Happineſs of Society, recommends it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
directly to our Approbation and Good-will.
Here is a Principle, which accounts, in great Part,
for the Origin of Morality: And what need we ſeek
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0352600600:88"/>
for abſtruſe and remote Syſtems, when there occurs
one ſo obvious and natural<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis needleſs to puſh our Reſearches ſo far as to aſk, why we have Humanity or a Fellow-feeling with others. 'Tis ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that this is experienc'd to be a Principle in human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We muſt ſtop ſomewhere in our Examination of Cauſes; and there are, in every Science, ſome general Principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any Principle more general. No Man is abſolutely indifferent to the Happineſs and Miſery of others. The firſt has a natural Tendency to give Pleaſure; the ſecond, Pain. This every one may find in himſelf. It is not probable, that theſe Principles can be reſolv'd into Principles more ſimple and univerſal, whatever Attempts may have been made to that Purpoſe. But if it were poſſible, it belongs not to the preſent Subject; and we may here ſafely conſider theſe Principles as original: Happy, if we can render all the Conſequences ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently plain and perſpicuous.</note>?</p>
               <p>HAVE we any Difficulty to comprehend the Force
of Humanity and Benevolence? Or to conceive,
that the very Aſpect of Happineſs, Joy, Proſperity,
gives Pleaſure; that of Pain, Sufferance, Sorrow,
communicates Uneaſineſs? The human Countenance,
ſays <hi>Horace</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <l>Uti ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent</l>

                  </note>, borrows Smiles or Tears from the
human Countenance. Reduce a Perſon to Solitude,
and he loſes all Enjoyment, except merely of the
ſpeculative Kind; and that becauſe the Movements
of his Heart are not forwarded by correſpondent
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0352600600:89"/>
Movements in his Fellow-creatures. The Signs of
Sorrow and Mourning, tho' arbitrary, affect us with
Melancholy; but the natural Symptoms, Tears,
and Cries, and Groans, never fail to infuſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
and Uneaſineſs. And if the Effects of Miſery
touch us in ſo lively a Manner; can we be ſuppos'd
altogether inſenſible or indifferent towards its Cauſes;
when a malicious or treacherous Character and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
is preſented to us?</p>
               <p>WE enter, I ſhall ſuppoſe, into a convenient,
warm, well-contriv'd Apartment: We neceſſarily

preſents us with the pleaſing Ideas of Eaſe, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and Enjoyment. The hoſpitable, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour'd,
humane Landlord appears. This Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſurely muſt embelliſh the whole; nor can we
eaſily forbear reflecting, with Pleaſure, on the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and Enjoyment, which reſults to every one
from his Intercourſe and Good-offices.</p>

whatever we reflect on or converſe about; every
Thing ſtill preſents us with the View of human Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs

Movement of Pleaſure or Uneaſineſs. In
our ſerious Occupations, in our careleſs Amuſements,
this Principle ſtill exerts its active Energy.</p>
               <p>A MAN, who enters the Theatre, is immediately

Appearance of a full Audience; and rais'd to a
Degree of Enthuſiaſm, which they cannot command
in any ſolitary or calm Moment.</p>
               <p>EVERY Movement of the Theatre, by a ſkillful
Poet, is communicated, as it were by Magic, to the
Spectators, who weep, tremble, reſent, rejoice, and
are enflam'd with all the Variety of Paſſions, which
actuate the ſeveral Perſonages of the Drama.</p>
               <p>WHERE any Event croſſes our Wiſhes, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
the Happineſs of the favourite Perſonages, we
feel a ſenſible Anxiety and Concern. But where
their Sufferings proceed from the Treachery, Cruelty

Indifference to the Audience, and checking the
Progreſs of the Paſſions.</p>
               <p>No Species of Poetry is more entertaining than
<hi>Paſtoral;</hi> and every one is ſenſible, that the chief
Source of its Pleaſure ariſes from thoſe Images of a
gentle and tender Tranquillity, which it repreſents
in its Perſonages, and of which it communicates a
like Sentiment to the Readers. <hi>Sannazarius,</hi> who
transfer'd the Scene to the Sea-ſhore, tho' he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

confeſt to have err'd in his Choice. The Idea of
Toil, Labour, and Danger, ſuffer'd by the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
is painful, by an unavoidable Sympathy, which
attends every Conception of human Happineſs or
Miſery.</p>
               <p>WHEN I was twenty, ſays a <hi>French</hi> Poet, <hi>Ovid</hi>
was my Choice: Now I am forty, I declare for
<hi>Horace.</hi> We enter, to be ſure, more readily into
Sentiments, that reſemble thoſe we feel every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But no Paſſion, when well repreſented, can
be altogether indifferent to us; becauſe there is
none, of which every Man has not within him, at
leaſt, the Seeds and firſt Principles. 'Tis the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Poetry to approach every Object by lively
Imagery and Deſcription, and make it look like
Truth and Reality: A certain Proof, that wherever
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0352600600:93"/>
that Reality is found, our Minds are diſpos'd to be
ſtrongly affected by it.</p>
               <p>ANY recent Event or Piece of News, by which
the Fortunes of States, Provinces or many Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,
are affected, is extremely intereſting even to
thoſe whoſe Welfare is not immediately engag'd.
Such Intelligence is propagated with Celerity, heard
with Avidity, and enquir'd into with Attention and
Concern. The Intereſts of Society appear, on this
Occaſion, to be, in ſome Degree, the Intereſts of
each Individual. The Imagination is ſure to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;

               <p>THE indifferent, unintereſting Stile of <hi>Suetonius,</hi>

But what a Difference of Sentiment! While
the former coldly relates the Facts; and the latter
ſets before our Eyes the venerable Figures of a
<hi>Soranus</hi> and a <hi>Thraſea,</hi> intrepid in their Fate, and
only mov'd by the melting Sorrows of their Friends
and Kindred. What Sympathy then touches every
human Heart! What Indignation againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
Tyrant, whoſe cauſeleſs Fear or unprovok'd
Malice, gave riſe to ſuch deteſtable Barbarity!</p>
               <p>IF we bring theſe Subjects nearer: If we remove
all Suſpicion of Fiction and Deceit: What powerful
Concern is excited, and how much ſuperior, in
many Inſtances, to the narrow Attachments of Self-love
and private Intereſt! Popular Sedition, Party
Zeal, a devoted Obedience to factious Leaders;
theſe are ſome of the moſt viſible, tho' leſs laudable
Effects of this ſocial Sympathy in human Nature.</p>

What Wonder, then, if we can pronounce

Not to mention, that while every man conſults the Good of his own Community, we are ſenſible, that the general Intereſt of Mankind is better promoted, than by any looſe indeterminate Views to the Good of a Species, whence no beneficial Action could ever reſult, for want of a duly limited Object, on which they could exert themſelves.</note>?</p>

IF any Man, from a cold Inſenſibility, or narrow
Selfiſhneſs of Temper, is unaffected with the Images
of human Happineſs or Miſery, he muſt be equally
indifferent to the Images of Vice and Virtue: As
on the other Hand, 'tis always found, that a warm
Concern for the Intereſts of our Species is attended
with a delicate Feeling of all moral Diſtinctions; a
ſtrong Reſentment of Injury done to Men; a lively
Approbation of their Welfare. In this Particular,
tho' great Superiority is obſervable of one Man
above another; yet none are ſo entirely indifferent
to the Intereſt of their Fellow-creatures, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no Diſtinctions of moral Good and Evil, in
conſequence of the different Tendencies of Actions
and Principles. How, indeed, can we ſuppoſe it
poſſible of any one, who wears a human Heart,
that, if there be ſubjected to his Cenſure, one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
or Syſtem of Conduct, which is beneficial,
and another, which is pernicious, to his Species or
Community, he will not ſo much as give a cool
Preference to the former, or aſcribe to it the ſmalleſt
Merit or Regard? Let us ſuppoſe ſuch a Perſon
ever ſo ſelfiſh; let private Intereſt have ingroſt ever
ſo much his Attention; yet in Inſtances, where
that is not concern'd, he muſt unavoidably feel <hi>ſome</hi>
Propenſity to the Good of Mankind, and make it
an Object of Choice, if every Thing elſe be equal.

no private Regards draw us to ſeek our own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion

All Mankind ſo far reſemble the good Principle,
that where Intereſt or Revenge or Envy perverts not

of the ſame Size in both Situations; becauſe
we know, that, on our Approach to it, its Image
would expand on the Senſes, and that the Difference
conſiſts not in the Object itſelf, but in our Poſition
with regard to it. And, indeed, without ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

               <p>THE more we converſe with Mankind, and the
greater ſocial Entercourſe we maintain, the more
will we be familiariz'd to theſe general Preferences
and Diſtinctions, without which our Converſation
and Diſcourſe could ſcarcely be render'd intelligible
to each other. Every Man's Intereſt is peculiar to
himſelf, and the Averſions and Deſires, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
from it, cannot be ſuppos'd to affect others in a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0352600600:102"/>
like Degree. General Language, therefore, being
form'd for general Uſe, muſt be moulded on ſome
more general Views, and muſt affix the Epithets of
Praiſe or Blame, in Conformity to Sentiments,
which ariſe from the general Intereſts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.
And if theſe Sentiments, in moſt Men,
be not ſo ſtrong as thoſe, which have a Reference
to private Good; yet ſtill they muſt make ſome
Diſtinction, even in Perſons the moſt deprav'd and
ſelfiſh; and muſt attach the Notion of Good to a
beneficent Conduct, and of Evil to the contrary.
Sympathy, we ſhall allow, is much fainter than our
Concern for Ourſelves, and Sympathy with Perſons,
remote from us, much ſainter than that with Perſons,
near and contiguous; but for this very Reaſon,
'tis neceſſary for us, in our calm Judgments and
Diſcourſe concerning the Characters of Men, to
neglect all theſe Differences, and render our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
more public and ſocial. Beſides, that we
Ourſelves often change our Situation in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
we every Day meet with Perſons, who are in a
different Situation from us, and who could never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with us on any reaſonable Terms, were we to
remain conſtantly in that Poſition and Point of View,
which is peculiar to Ourſelf. The Entercourſe of
Sentiments, therefore, in Society and Converſation
makes us form ſome general, inalterable Standard,
by which we may approve or diſapprove of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters

               <p>THUS, in whatever Light we take this Subject,
the Merit, aſcrib'd to the ſocial Virtues, appears
ſtill uniform, and ariſes chiefly from that Regard,
which the natural Sentiment of Benevolence engages
us to pay to the Intereſts of Mankind and Society.
If we conſider the Principles of the human Make;
ſuch as they appear to daily Experience and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0352600600:104"/>
we muſt, <hi>a priori,</hi> conclude it impoſſible for
ſuch a Creature as Man to be totally indifferent to
the Well or Ill-being of his Fellow-creatures, and
not readily, of himſelf, to pronounce, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
gives him any particular Byaſs, that what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
their Happineſs is good, what tends to their
Miſery is evil, without any farther Regard or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
Here then are the faint Rudiments, at
leaſt, or Outlines, of a <hi>general</hi> Diſtinction betwixt
Actions; and in Proportion as the Humanity of the
Perſon is ſuppos'd to encreaſe, his Connexion to
thoſe injur'd or benefited, and his lively Conception
of their Miſery or Happineſs; his conſequent Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or Approbation acquires proportionable Force
and Vigour. There is no Neceſſity, that a generous
Action, barely mention'd in an old Hiſtory or remote
Gazette, ſhould communicate any ſtrong Feelings of
Applauſe and Admiration. Virtue, plac'd at ſuch a
Diſtance, is like a fixt Star, which, tho', to the Eye
of Reaſon, it may appear as luminous as the Sun in
his Meridian, is ſo infinitely remov'd, as to affect
the Senſes, neither with Light nor Heat. Bring this
Virtue nearer, by our Acquaintance or Connexion
with the Perſons, or even by an eloquent Narration
and Recital of the Caſe; our Hearts are immediately
caught, our Sympathy enliven'd, and our cool Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
converted into the warmeſt Sentiments of
Friendſhip and Regard. Theſe ſeem neceſſary and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0352600600:105"/>
infallible Conſequences of the general Principles of
human Nature, as diſcover'd in common Life and
Practice.</p>
               <p>AGAIN; reverſe theſe Views and Reaſonings:
Conſider the Matter <hi>a poſteriori;</hi> and weighing the
Conſequences, enquire, if the Merit of all ſocial
Virtue is not deriv'd from the Feelings of Humanity,
with which it affects the Spectators. It appears to be
Matter of Fact, that the Circumſtance of <hi>Utility,</hi>
in all Subjects, is a Source of Praiſe and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
That it is conſtantly appeal'd to in all moral
Deciſions concerning the Merit and Demerit of
Actions: That it is the <hi>ſole</hi> Source of that high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
paid to Juſtice, Fidelity, Honour, Allegiance
and Chaſtity: That it is inſeperable from all the
other ſocial Virtues of Humanity, Generoſity, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Affability, Lenity, Mercy and Moderation:
And in a Word, that it is the Foundation of the
chief Part of Morals, which has a Reference to
Mankind and Society.</p>
               <p>IT appears alſo, in our general Approbation or
Judgment of Characters and Manners, that the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tendency of the ſocial Virtues moves us not by
any Regards to Self-intereſt, but has an Influence
much more univerſal and extenſive. It appears,
that a Tendency to public Good, and to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0352600600:106"/>
of Peace, Harmony, and Concord in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
by affecting the benevolent Principles of our
Frame, engages us on the Side of the ſocial Virtues.
And it appears, as an additional Confirmation, that
theſe Principles of Humanity and Sympathy enter
ſo deep into all our Sentiments, and have ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an Influence, as may enable them to excite the
ſtrongeſt Cenſure and Applauſe. The preſent
Theory is the ſimple Reſult of all theſe Inferences,
each of which ſeems founded on uniform Experience
and Obſervation.</p>
               <p>WERE it doubtful, whether there was any ſuch
Principle in our Nature as Humanity or a Concern
for others, yet when we ſee, in numberleſs Inſtances,
that, whatever has a Tendency to promote the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of Society, is ſo highly approv'd of, we ought
thence to learn the Force of the benevolent Principle;
ſince 'tis impoſſible for any Thing to pleaſe as Means
to an End, where the End itſelf is totally indifferent:
On the other Hand, were it doubtful, whether there
was, implanted in our Natures, any general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of moral Blame and Approbation, yet when
we ſee, in numberleſs Inſtances, the Influence of
Humanity, we ought thence to conclude, that 'tis
impoſſible, but that every Thing, which promotes
the Intereſts of Society, muſt communicate Pleaſure,
and what is pernicious give Uneaſineſs. But when
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0352600600:107"/>
theſe different Reflections and Obſervations concur
in eſtabliſhing the ſame Concluſion, muſt they not
beſtow an undiſputed Evidence upon it?</p>
               <p>'Tis however hop'd, that the Progreſs of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
will bring a farther Confirmation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Theory, by ſhowing the Riſe of other Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

And hence the Reaſon, in my Opinion, why, tho'

               <p>WHAT is it then we can here diſpute about? If
Senſe and Courage, Temperance and Induſtry,
Wit and Knowledge confeſſedly form a conſiderable
Part of <hi>perſonal Merit;</hi> if a Man poſſeſt of them is
both better ſatisfy'd with himſelf, and better entitled

to the Good-will, Eſteem, and Services of others,
than one entirely devoid of them; if, in ſhort, the
<hi>Sentiments</hi> be ſimilar, that ariſe from theſe Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and from the ſocial Virtues; is there any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for being ſo extremely ſcrupulous about a <hi>Word,</hi>
or doubting whether they are entitled to the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Virtue<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems to me, that in our Language, Courage, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Induſtry, Frugality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to popular Stile, are call'd <hi>Virtues;</hi> but when a Man is ſaid to be <hi>virtuous,</hi> or is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated a Man of Virtue, we chiefly regard his ſocial Qualities. 'Tis needleſs for a moral, philoſophical Diſcourſe to enter into all theſe Caprices of Language, which are ſo variable in different Dialects, and in different Ages of the ſame Dialect. The <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> of Men, being more uniform, as well as more important, are a fitter Subject of Speculation: Tho' at the ſame Time, we may juſt obſerve, that wherever the ſocial Virtues are talk'd of, 'tis plainly imploy'd, by this Diſtinction, that there are alſo other Virtues of a different Nature.</note>? It may, indeed, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the Sentiment of Approbation, which
thoſe Accompliſhments produce, beſides its being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior,</hi>
is alſo ſomewhat <hi>different</hi> from that, which
attends the Virtues of Juſtice and Humanity. But
this ſeems not a ſufficient Reaſon for ranking them
entirely under different Claſſes and Appellations.
The Character of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and that of <hi>Cato,</hi> as drawn
by <hi>Saluſt,</hi> are both of them virtuous, in the ſtricteſt
Senſe of the Word; but in a different Way: Nor
are the Sentiments entirely the ſame, which ariſe
from them. The one produces Love; the other,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0352600600:113"/>
Eſteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We
could wiſh to meet the one Character in a Friend;
the other we ſhould be ambitious of in Ourſelves.
In like Manner the Approbation, which attends na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Abilities or Temperance or Induſtry, may be
ſomewhat different from that which is paid to the
ſocial Virtues, without making them entirely of a
different Species. And indeed, we may obſerve,
that the natural Abilities, no more than the other
Virtues, produce not, all of them, the ſame Kind of
Approbation. Good Senſe and Genius beget Eſteem
and Regard: Wit and Humour excite Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note n="*" place="bottom">Love and Eſteem are nearly the ſame Paſſion, and ariſe from ſimilar Cauſes. The Qualities, which produce both, are ſuch as communicate Pleaſure. But where this Pleaſure is ſevere and ſerious; or where its Object is great and makes a ſtrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or where it produces any Degree of Humility and Awe: In all theſe Caſes, the Paſſion, which ariſes from the Pleaſure, is more properly denominated Eſteem than Love. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence attends both: But is connected with Love in a more eminent Degree. There ſeems to be ſtill a ſtronger Mixture of Pride in Contempt than of Humility in Eſteem; and the Reaſon would not be difficult to one, who ſtudy'd accurately the Paſſions. All theſe various Mixtures and Compoſitions and Appearances of Sentiment form a very curious Subject of Speculation, but are wide of our preſent Purpoſe. Thro'out theſe Eſſays, we always conſider in general, what Qualities are a Subject of Praiſe or of Cenſure, without entering into all the minute Differences of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, which they excite. 'Tis evident, that whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd, is alſo diſlik'd, as well as what is hated; and we here endeavour to take Objects, according to their moſt ſimple Views and Appearances. Theſe Sciences are but too apt to appear ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract to common Readers, even with all the Precautions we can take to clear them from ſuperfluous Speculations, and bring them down to every Capacity.</note>.</p>

Great Boldneſs in affronting Danger; great Prudence

               <p>IN general, we may obſerve, that the Diſtinction

be allow'd, that <hi>Sentiments</hi> are every Day experienc'd

it behoves us, if not as Moraliſts, as ſpeculative

               <p>IT ſeems evident, that where a Quality or Habit
is ſubjected to our Examination, if it appear, in
any reſpect, prejudicial to the Perſon, poſſeſt of it,
or ſuch as incapacitates him for Buſineſs and Action,
it is inſtantly blam'd, and rank'd amongſt his Faults
and Imperfections. Indolence, Negligence, Want
of Order and Method, Obſtinacy, Fickleneſs, Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Credulity; no one ever eſteem'd theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
indifferent to a Character; much leſs, extoll'd
them as Accompliſhments or Virtues. The Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
reſulting from them, immediately ſtrikes our
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0352600600:121"/>
Eye, and gives us the Sentiment of Pain and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation.</p>
               <p>No Qualiity, 'tis allow'd, is abſolutely either
blameable or praiſe-worthy. 'Tis all according to
its Degrees. A due Medium, ſay the <hi>Peripatetics,</hi>
is the Characteriſtic of Virtue. But this Medium is
chiefly determin'd by Utility. A proper Celerity,
for Inſtance, and Diſpatch in Buſineſs is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
When defective, no Progreſs is ever made in
the Execution of any Purpoſe: When exceſſive, it
engages us in precipitate, and ill-concerted Meaſures
and Enterprizes. By ſuch Reaſonings as theſe we
fix the proper and commendable Mediocrity in all
moral and prudential Diſquiſitions; and never loſe
View of the Advantages, which reſult from any
Character or Habit.</p>
               <p>Now as theſe Advantages are enjoy'd by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
poſſeſt of the Character, it can never be <hi>Self-love,</hi>
which renders the Proſpect of them agreeable
to us, the Spectators, and prompts our Eſteem and
Approbation. No Force of Imagination can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
us into another Perſon, and make us fancy,
that we being that Perſon, reap Benefit from thoſe
valuable Qualities, which belong to him. Or if it
did, no Celerity of Imagination could immediately
tranſport us back, into ourſelves, and make us love
and eſteem the Perſon, as different from us. Views
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0352600600:122"/>
and Sentiments, ſo oppoſite to known Truth, and to
each other, could never have place, at the ſame
Time, in the ſame Perſon. All Suſpicion, therefore, of
ſelfiſh Regards are here totally excluded. 'Tis a quite
different Principle, which actuates our Boſom, and

ſuch agreeable Images, and feel a Complacency and

Sympathy and Humanity<note n="*" place="bottom">One may venture to affirm, that there is no human Creature, to whom the Appearance of Happineſs, (where Envy or Revenge has no Place) does not give Pleaſure, that of Miſery, Uneaſineſs. This ſeems inſeperable from our Make and Conſtitution. But they are only the more generous Minds, that are thence prompted to ſeek zealouſly the Good of others, and to have a real Paſſion for their Welfare. With Men of narrow and ungenerous Spirits, this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy goes not beyond a ſlight Feeling of the Imagination, which ſerves only to excite Sentiments of Complacency or Cenſure, and make them apply to the Object either honourable or diſhonourable Appellations.

LET us ſuppoſe a Perſon originally ſo fram'd as
to have no Manner of Concern for his Fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but to regard the Happineſs and Miſery of
all ſenſible Beings with greater Indifference even
than two contiguous Shades of the ſame Colour.
Let us ſuppoſe, if the Proſperity of Nations were
lay'd on the one hand and their Ruin on the other,
and he were deſir'd to chooſe; that he would ſtand,
like the Schoolman's Aſs, irreſolute and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
betwixt equal Motives; or rather, like the
ſame Aſs betwixt two Pieces of Wood or Marble,
without any Inclination or Propenſity on either Side.
The Conſequence, I believe, muſt be allow'd juſt,
that ſuch a Perſon, being abſolutely unconcern'd,
either as to the public Good of a Community or the
private Utility of others, would look on every Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
however pernicious, or however beneficial, to
Society or to its Poſſeſſor, with the ſame Indifference
as on the moſt common and unintereſting Object.</p>
               <p>BUT if, inſtead of this fancy'd Monſter, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a <hi>Man</hi> to form a Judgment or Determination in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0352600600:124"/>
the Caſe; there is to him a plain Foundation of
Preference, where every Thing elſe is equal; and
however cool his Choice may be, if his Heart be
ſelfiſh, or if the Perſons intereſted be remote from
him; there muſt ſtill be a Choice, and a Diſtinction
betwixt what is uſeful, and what is pernicious. Now
this Diſtinction is the ſame in all its Parts, with the
<hi>moral Diſtinction,</hi> whoſe Foundation has been ſo oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ſo much in vain, enquir'd after. The ſame
Endowments of the Mind, in every Circumſtance,
are agreeable to the Sentiment of Morals and to that
of Humanity; the ſame Temper is ſuſceptible of
high Degrees of the one Sentiment and of the other;
and the ſame Alteration in the Objects, by their
nearer Approach or by Connexions, enlivens the one
and the other. By all the Rules of Philoſophy,
therefore, we muſt conclude, that theſe Sentiments
are originally the ſame; ſince, in each particular,
even the moſt minute, they are govern'd by the ſame
Laws, and are mov'd by the ſame Objects.</p>
               <p>WHY do Philoſophers infer, with the greateſt
Certainty, that the Moon is kept in its Orbit by the
ſame Force of Gravity, which makes Bodies fall
near the Surface of the Earth, but becauſe theſe
Effects are, upon Computation, found ſimilar and
equal? And muſt not this Argument bring equal
Conviction, in moral as in natural Diſquiſitions?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0352600600:125"/>
To prove, by any long Detail, that all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
uſeful to the Poſſeſſor, are approv'd, and the
contrary cenſur'd, would be ſuperfluous. The leaſt
Reflection, on what is every Day experienc'd in Life,
will be ſufficient. We ſhall only mention a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
in order to remove, if poſſible, all Doubt
and Heſitation.</p>
               <p>THE Quality, the moſt neceſſary for the Execution
of any uſeful Enterprize, is DISCRETION;
by which we carry on a ſafe Intercourſe with others,
give due Attention to our own and to their Character,
weigh each Circumſtance of the Buſineſs we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
and employ the ſureſt and ſafeſt Means for the
Attainment of any End or Purpoſe. To a <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
perhaps, or a <hi>De Retz,</hi> Diſcretion may appear an
Alderman-like Virtue, as Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> calls it; and
being incompatible with thoſe vaſt Deſigns, to which
their Courage and Ambition prompted them, it
might really, in them, be a Fault or Imperfection.
But in the Conduct of ordinary Life, no Virtue is
more requiſite, not only to obtain Succeſs, but to
avoid the moſt fatal Miſcarriages and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The greateſt Parts without it, as obſerv'd by
an elegant Writer, may be fatal to their Owner; as
<hi>Polyphemus</hi> depriv'd of his Eye was only the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,

on Account of his enormous Strength and
Stature.</p>
               <p>THE beſt Character, indeed, were it not rather too
perfect for human Nature, is that which gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Temper of any Kind; but alternately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
Enterprize and Caution, as each is <hi>uſeful</hi> to the
particular Purpoſe intended. Such is the Excellence,
which St. <hi>Evremond</hi> aſcribes to Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi>
who diſplay'd every Campaign, as he grew older,
more Temerity in his military Enterprizes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Scipio</hi> enterprizing: And both ſucceeded,
becauſe the Situation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affars, during

               <p>WHAT need is there to diſplay the Praiſes of
INDUSTRY, and to extol its Advantages, in
the Acquiſition of Power and Riches, or in raiſing
what we call a <hi>Fortune</hi> in the World? The Tortoiſe,
according to the Fable, by his Aſſiduity, gain'd the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0352600600:127"/>
Race of the Hare, tho' poſſeſt of much ſuperior
Swiftneſs. A Man's Time, when well huſbanded,
is like a cultivated Field, of which a few Acres pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more of what is uſeful to Life, than extenſive
Provinces, even of the richeſt Soil, when over-run
with Weeds and Brambles.</p>
               <p>BUT all Proſpect of Succeſs in Life, or even of
tolerable Subſiſtence, muſt fail, where a reaſonable
FRUGALITY is wanting. The Heap, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of encreaſing, diminiſhes daily, and leaves its
Poſſeſſor ſo much more unhappy, that not having
been able to confine his Expences to a larger Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
he will ſtill leſs be able to live contentedly on a
ſmaller. The Souls of Men, according to <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Phaedo.</note>,
inflam'd with impure Appetites, and loſing the Body,
which alone afforded Means of Satisfaction, hover
about the Earth, and haunt the Places, where their
Bodies are repoſited; poſſeſt with a longing Deſire
to recover the loſt Organs of Senſation So may we
ſee worthleſs Prodigals, having conſum'd their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in wild Debauches, thruſting themſelves into
every plentiful Table, and every Party of Pleaſure,
hated even by the vicious, and deſpis'd even by

THE one Extreme of Frugality is <hi>Avarice,</hi> which,
as it both deprives a Man of all Uſe of his Riches,
and checks Hoſpitality and every ſocial Enjoyment,
is juſtly cenſur'd on a double Account: <hi>Prodigality,</hi>
the other Extreme, is commonly more hurtful to a
Man himſelf; and each of theſe Extremes is blam'd
above the other, according to the Temper of the
Perſon who cenſures, and according to his greater or
leſs Senſibility to Pleaſure, either ſocial or ſenſual.</p>
               <p>ALL Men, 'tis allow'd, are equally deſirous of
Happineſs; but all Men are not equally ſucceſsful in
the Purſuit: Of which one chief Cauſe is the common
Want of STRENGTH of MIND, which
might enable us to reſiſt the Temptation of preſent
Eaſe or Pleaſure, and carry us forward in the Search
of more diſtant Profit and Enjoyment. Our Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
on a general Proſpect of their Objects, form
certain Rules of Conduct, and certain Meaſures of
Preference of one above another: And theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions,
tho' really the Reſult of our calm Paſſions,
and Propenſities, (for what elſe can pronounce any
Object eligible or the contrary?) are yet ſaid, by a
natural Abuſe of Terms, to be the Determinations
of pure <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Reflection. But when ſome of
theſe Objects approach nearer us, or acquire the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of favourable Lights and Poſitions, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0352600600:129"/>
catch the Heart or Imagination; our general Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
are frequently confounded, a ſmall Enjoyment
preferr'd, and laſting Shame and Sorrow entail'd
upon us. And however Poets may employ their
Wit and Eloquence, in celebrating preſent Pleaſure,
and rejecting all diſtant Views to Fame, Health, or
Fortune; 'tis obvious, that this Practice is the Source
of all Diſſoluteneſs and Debauchery, Repentance
and Miſery. A Man of a ſtrong and determin'd
Temper adheres tenaciouſly to his general Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and is neither ſeduc'd by the Allurements of
Pleaſure, nor terrify'd by the Menaces of Pain;
but keeps ſtill in View thoſe diſtant Purſuits, by which
he, at once, enſures his Happineſs and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>SELF-SATISFACTION, at leaſt in ſome Degree, is
an Advantage, that equally attends the FOOL
and the WISE-MAN: But 'tis the only one;
nor is there any other Circumſtance in the Conduct
of Life, where they are upon an equal Footing.
Buſineſs, Books, Converſation; for all of theſe, a
Fool is totally incapacitated, and except condemn'd
by his Station to the coarſeſt Drudgery, remains a
<hi>uſeleſs</hi> Burthen upon the Earth. Accordingly, 'tis
found, that Men are infinitely jealous of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in this Particular; and many Inſtances are
ſeen of Profligacy and Treachery, the moſt avow'd,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0352600600:130"/>
and unreſerved; none of bearing patiently the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Ignorance and Stupidity. <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi>
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> General, who, as <hi>Polybius</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 17. Cap. 35.</note> tells us,
openly erected one Altar to Impiety, and another to
Injuſtice, in order to bid Defiance to Mankind;
even he, I am well aſſur'd, would have ſtarted at
the Epithet of <hi>Fool,</hi> and have meditated Revenge for
ſo injurious an Appellation. Except the Affection of
Parents, the ſtrongeſt and moſt indiſſoluble Bond in
Nature, no Connexion has Strength ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Diſguſt ariſing from this Character. Love
itſelf, which can ſubſiſt under Treachery, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
Malice, and Infidelity, is immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd
by it, when perceiv'd and acknowledg'd;
nor are Deformity and Old-age more fatal to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of that Paſſion. So dreadful are the Ideas
of an utter Incapacity for any Purpoſe or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and of continu'd Error and Miſconduct in
Life!</p>
               <p>WHEN 'tis aſk'd, whether a quick or a ſlow Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
be moſt valuable? Whether one, that,
at firſt View, penetrates far into a Subject, but can
perform nothing upon Study; or a contrary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
which muſt work out every Thing by Dint of
Application? Whether a clear Head or a copious
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0352600600:131"/>
Invention? Whether a profound Genius or a ſure
Judgment? In ſhort, what Character, or peculiar
Turn of Underſtanding is more excellent than
another? 'Tis evident, we can anſwer none of
theſe Queſtions, without conſidering which of thoſe
Qualities capacitates a Man beſt for the World, and
carries him faitheſt in any of his Undertakings.</p>
               <p>IF refin'd Senſe and exalted Senſe be not ſo <hi>uſeful</hi>
as common Senſe, their Rarity, their Novelty, and
the Nobleneſs of their Objects make ſome Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and render them the Admiration of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
As Gold, tho' leſs ſerviceable than Iron, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
from its Scarcity, a Value, which is much
ſuperior.</p>
               <p>THE Deſects of Judgment can be ſupply'd by no
Art or Invention; but thoſe of MEMORY fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
may, both in Buſineſs and in Study, by
Method and Induſtry, and by Diligence in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
every Thing to Paper; and we ſcarce ever hear
a ſhort Memory given as a Reaſon for a Man's Want
of Succeſs in any Undertaking. But in antient
Times, when no Man could make a Figure without
the Talent of ſpeaking, and when the Audience
were too delicate to bear ſuch crude, undigeſted
Harangues as our extemporary Orators offer to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Aſſemblies; the Faculty of Memory was then of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0352600600:132"/>
the utmoſt Conſequence, and was accordingly much
more valued than at preſent. Scarce any great
Genius is mention'd in Antiquity, who is not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
for this Talent; and <hi>Cicero</hi> enumerates it
amongſt the other ſublime Qualities of <hi>Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, literae, cura, cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio, diligentia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Phillip. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR Cuſtoms and Manners alter the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Qualities: they alſo alter their Merit.
Particular Situations and Accidents have, in ſome
Degree, the ſame Influence. He will always be
more eſteem'd, who profeſſes thoſe Talents and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments,
which ſuit his Station and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
than the whom Fortune has miſplac'd in the
Part ſhe has aſſign'd him. The private or ſelfiſh
Virtues are, in this reſpect, more arbitrary than the
public and ſocial. In other reſpects, they are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
leſs liable to Doubt and Controverſy.</p>
               <p>IN this Kingdom, ſuch continu'd Oſtentation, of
late Years, has been diſplay'd among Men in <hi>active</hi>
Life, with regard to <hi>public Spirit,</hi> and among thoſe
in <hi>ſpeculative</hi> with regard to <hi>Benevolence;</hi> and ſo
many falſe Pretenſions to each have been, no doubt,
detected, that Men of the World are apt, without

any bad Intention, to diſcover a ſullen Incredulity
on the head of theſe moral Endowments, and even
ſometimes abſolutely to deny their Exiſtence and
Reality. In like Manner, I find, that, of old, the
perpetual Cant of the <hi>Stoics</hi> and <hi>Cynics</hi> concerning
<hi>Virtue,</hi> their magnificent Profeſſions and ſlender Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
bred a Diſguſt in Mankind; and <hi>Lucian,</hi>

ſurely, this peeviſh Delicacy, whence-ever it ariſes,
can never be carry'd ſo far as to make us deny the
Exiſtence of every Species of Virtue, and all Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Avowal of their Merit, there are many others,
to which the moſt determin'd Sceptiſm cannot, for a

<hi>Temperance, Sobriety, Patience, Conſtancy,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0352600600:134"/>
Perſeverance, Forethought, Conſiderateneſs, Secrecy,
Order, Inſinuation, Addreſs, Preſence of Mind, Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Conception, Facility of Expreſſion;</hi> theſe and a
thouſand more of the ſame Kind, no Man will ever
deny to be Excellencies and Endowments. As their
Merit conſiſts in their Tendency to ſerve the Perſon,
poſſeſt of them, without any magnificent Claims of
public and ſocial Deſert, we are the leſs jealous of
their Pretenſions, and readily admit them into the
Catalogue of Virtues. We are not ſenſible, that,
by this Conceſſion, we have pav'd the Way for all
the other moral Excellencies, and cannot conſiſtently
heſitate any longer, with regard to diſintereſted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,
Patriotiſm, and Humanity.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems, indeed, certain, that firſt Appearances
are here, as uſual, extremely deceitful, and that 'tis
more difficult, in a ſpeculative Way, to reſolve into
Self-love the Merit we aſcribe to the ſelfiſh Virtues
above-mention'd, than that even of the ſocial Virtues
of Juſtice and Beneficence. For this latter Purpoſe,
we need but ſay, that whatever Conduct and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
promotes the Good of the Community, is
lov'd, prais'd, and eſteem'd by the Community, on
Account of that Utility and Intereſt, of which every
one partakes: And tho' this Affection and Regard
be, in Reality, Gratitude, not Self-love, yet a
Diſtinction, even of this obvious Nature, may not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0352600600:135"/>
readily be made by ſuperficial Reaſoners; and there
is Room, at leaſt, to ſupport the Cavil and Diſpute
for a Moment. But as Qualities, which tend only
to the Utility of their Poſſeſſor, without any Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to us, or to the Community, are yet eſteem'd
and valu'd; by what Theory or Syſtem can we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for this Sentiment from Self-love, or deduce it
from that favourite Origin? There ſeems here a
Neceſſity of confeſſing that the Happineſs and
Miſery of others are not Spectacles altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to us, but that the View of the former,
whether in its Cauſes or Effects, like Sun-ſhine or
the Proſpect of well-cultivated Plains (to carry our
Pretenſions no higher) communicates a ſecret Joy
and Satisfaction; the Appearance of the latter,
like a lowering Cloud or barren Landſkip, throws a
melancholy Damp over the Imagination. And this
Conceſſion being once made, the Difficulty is over;
and a natural, unforc'd Interpretation of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of human Life will afterwards, we may
hope, prevail, amongſt all ſpeculative Enquirers.</p>

A DISPOSITION or Turn of Mind, which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Man to riſe in the World, and advance his
Fortune, is entitled to Eſteem and Regard, as has
been already explain'd. It may, therefore, naturally
be ſuppos'd, that the actual Poſſeſſion of Riches and
Authority will have a conſiderable Influence over
theſe Sentiments.</p>
               <p>LET us examine any Hypotheſis, by which we can
account for the Regard, pay'd the Rich and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
We ſhall find none ſatisfactory but that which
derives it from the Enjoyment, communicated by the
Images of Proſperity, Happineſs, Eaſe, Plenty,
Command, and the Gratification of every Appetite.
Self-love, for Inſtance, which ſome affect ſo much
to conſider as the Source of every Sentiment, is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0352600600:140"/>
plainly inſufficient to this Purpoſe. Where no Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
or Friendship appears, 'tis difficult to conceive
on what we can found our Hope of Advantage from
the Riches of others; tho' we naturally eſteem and
reſpect the Rich, even before they diſcover any
ſuch favourable Diſpoſition towards us.</p>
               <p>WE are affected with the ſame Sentiments, when
we lie ſo much out of the Sphere of their Activity,
that they cannot even be ſuppos'd to poſſeſs the
Power of ſerving us. A Priſoner of War, in all
civiliz'd Nations, is treated with a Regard, ſuited to
his Condition; and Riches, 'tis evident, go far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fixing the Condition of any Perſon. If Birth
and Quality enter for a Share, this ſtill affords us an
Argument to our preſent Purpoſe. For what is it
we call a Man of Birth, but one, who is deſcended
from a long Succeſſion of rich and powerful An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
and who acquires our Eſteem by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

with Perſons, whom we eſteem? His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
therefore, tho' dead, are reſpected, in ſome
Meaſure, on Account of their Riches; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
without any Kind of Expectation.</p>
               <p>BUT not to go ſo far as Priſoners of War or the
Dead, to find Inſtances of this diſintereſted Regard
for Riches; we may only obſerve, with a little At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
thoſe Phaenomena, that occur in common
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0352600600:141"/>
Life and Converſation. A Man, who is himſelf,
we ſhall ſuppoſe, of a competent Fortune, and of
no Profeſſion, coming into a Company of Strangers,
naturally treats them with different Degrees of Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and Deference, as he is inform'd of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Fortunes and Conditions; tho' 'tis impoſſible
he can ſo ſuddenly propoſe, and perhaps would not
accept of, any pecuniary Advantage from them. A
Traveller is always admitted into Company, and
meets with Civility, in Proportion as his Train and
Equipage ſpeak him a Man of great or moderate
Fortune. In ſhort, the different Ranks of Man are,
in a great Meaſure, regulated by Riches; and that
with regard to Superiors as well as Inferiors, Strangers
as well as Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>WHAT remains, therefore, but to conclude, that
as Riches are deſir'd for ourſelf only as the Means
of gratifying our Appetites, either at preſent or in
ſome imaginary future Period; they beget Eſteem
in others merely from their having that Influence.
This indeed is their very Nature or Eſſence: They
have a direct Reference to the Commodities, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
and Pleaſures of Life: A Banker's Bill,
who is broke, or Gold in a deſart Iſland, would
otherwiſe be full as valuable. When we approach a
Man, who is, as we ſay, at his Eaſe, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
with the pleaſing Ideas of Plenty, Satisfaction,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0352600600:142"/>
Cleanlineſs, Warmth; a chearful Houſe, elegant
Furniture, ready Service, and whatever is deſirable
in Meat, Drink, or Apparel. On the contrary,
when a poor Man appears, the diſagreeable Images
of Want, Penury, hard Labour, dirty Furniture,
coarſe or ragged Cloaths, nauſeous Meat and diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Liquor, immediately ſtrike our Fancy. What
elſe do we mean by ſaying the one is rich, the other
poor? And as Regard or Contempt is the natural
Conſequence of theſe different Situations in Life;
'tis eaſily ſeen what additional Light and Evidence
this throws on our preceding Theory, with Regard
to all moral Diſtinctions<note n="*" place="bottom">There is ſomething very extraordinary, and ſeemingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable in the Operation of our Paſſions, when we conſider the Fortune and Situation of others. Very often another's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and Proſperity produces Envy, which has a ſtrong Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Hatred, and ariſes chiefly from the Compariſon of ourſelves with the Perſon. At the very ſame Time, or at leaſt, in very ſhort Intervals, we may feel the Paſſion of Reſpect, which is a Species of Affection or Good-will, with a Mixture of Humility. On the other hand, the Misfortunes of our Fellows often cauſe Pity, which has a ſtrong Mixture of Good-will. This Sentiment of Pity is nearly ally'd to Contempt, which is a Species of Diſlike, along with a Mixture of Pride. I only point out theſe Phaenomena, as a Subject of Speculation to ſuch as are curious with regard to moral Enquiries. 'Tis ſufficient for the preſent Purpoſe to obſerve in general, that Power and Riches commonly cauſe Reſpect, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Meanneſs Contempt, tho' particular Views and Incidents may ſometimes raiſe the Paſſions of Envy and of Pity.</note>.</p>

A MAN, who has cur'd himſelf of all ridiculous
Prepoſſeſſions, and is fully, ſincerely, and ſteddily
convinc'd, from Experience as well as Philoſophy,
that the Differences of Fortune make leſs Difference
in Happineſs than is vulgarly imagin'd; ſuch a one
meaſures not out Degrees of Eſteem according to the
Rent-rolls of his Acquaintance. He may, indeed,
externally pay a ſuperior Deference to the great Lord
above the Vaſſal; becauſe Riches are the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
being the moſt fixt and determinate, Source
of Diſtinction: But his internal Sentiments are more
regulated by the perſonal Characters of Men, than
by the accidental and capricious Favours of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>IN moſt Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> Family, that is,
hereditary Riches, mark'd with Titles and Symbols
from the Sovereign, is the chief Source of Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
In <hi>England,</hi> more Regard is paid to preſent
Opulence and Plenty. Each Practice has its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Diſadvantages. Where Birth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
unactive ſpiritleſs Minds remain in haughty
Indolence, and dream of nothing but Pedigrees and
Genealogies: The generous and ambitious ſeek
Honour and Command and Reputation and Favour.
Where Riches are the chief Idol, Corruption, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,
Rapine prevail: Arts, Manufactures, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0352600600:144"/>
Agriculture flouriſh. The former Prejudice,
being favourable to military Virtue, is more ſuited
to Monarchies. The other being the chief Spur to
Induſtry, agrees better with a republican Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And we accordingly find, that each of theſe
Forms of Government, by varying the <hi>Utility</hi> of
thoſe Cuſtoms, has commonly a proportionable
Effect on the Sentiments of Mankind.</p>

Ourſelves.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER has paſt an Evening with
ſerious melancholy People, and has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
how ſuddenly the Converſation was animated,
and what Sprightlineſs diffus'd itſelf over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
Diſcourſe, and Behaviour of every one,
on the Acceſſion of a good-humour'd, lively Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion;
ſuch a one, I ſay, will eaſily allow, that
CHEERFULNESS carries great Merit with
it, and naturally conciliates the Affection and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
of Mankind. No Quality, indeed, more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
communicates itſelf to all around; becauſe
none has a greater Propenſity to diſplay itſelf, in
jovial Talk and pleaſant Entertainment. The Flame
ſpreads thro' the whole Circle; and the moſt ſullen
and moroſe are often caught by it. That the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0352600600:146"/>
hate the merry, even tho' <hi>Horace</hi> ſays it, I
have ſome Difficulty to allow; becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
obſerv'd, that, where the Jollity is moderate
and decent, ſerious People are ſo much the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,
that it diſſipates the Gloom, with which
they are commonly oppreſt; and gives them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Satisfaction and Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>FROM this Influence of Cheerfulneſs, both to
communicate itſelf, and to engage Approbation, we
may perceive, that there are another Set of Virtues,
which, without any Utility or any Tendency to
farther Good, either of the Community or of the
Poſſeſſor, diffuſe a Satisfaction on the Beholders,
and conciliate Friendſhip and Regard. Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Senſation, to the Perſon poſſeſt of them,
is agreeable: Others enter into the ſame Humour,
and catch the Sentiment, by a Contagion or natural
Sympathy: And as we cannot forbear loving what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
pleaſes, a kindly Emotion ariſes towards the
Perſon, who communicates ſo much Delight and
Satisfaction. He is a more animating Spectacle:
His Preſence diffuſes over us more ſerene Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Enjoyment: Our Imagination, entering
into his Feelings and Diſpoſition, is affected in a
more agreeable Manner, than if a melancholy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
ſullen, anxious Temper were preſented to
our Notice and Obſervation. Hence the Affection
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0352600600:147"/>
and Approbation, which attends the former: The
Averſion and Diſguſt, with which we regard the
latter<note n="*" place="bottom">There is no Man, who, on particular Occaſions, is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with all the diſagreeable Paſſions, Fear, Anger, Dejection, Grief, Melancholy, Anxiety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe, ſo far as they are natural, and univerſal, make no Difference betwixt one Man and another, and can never be the Object of Blame, 'Tis only when the Diſpoſition gives a <hi>Propenſity</hi> to any of theſe diſagreeable Paſſions, that they disfigure the Character, and by giving Uneaſineſs, convey the Sentiment of Diſapprobation to the Spectator.</note>.</p>

            <p>PLACE in Oppoſition the Picture which <hi>Tacitus</hi>

his lgnominy from a wretched Love of Life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
over to the mercileſs Rabble; toſt, buffetted,
and kickt about; and conſtrain'd, by their holding
a Poynard under his Chin, to raiſe his Head, and
expoſe himſelf to every Contumely. What abject
Infamy! What low Humiliation! Yet even here,
ſays the Hiſtorian, he diſcover'd ſome Symptoms of
a Mind not altogether degenerate. To a Tribune,
who inſulted him, he reply'd, <hi>I am ſtill your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>

To enter thoroughly into this Method of thinking, we muſt make Allowance for the antient Maxims, that no one ought to prolong his Life after it became diſhonourable; but as he had always a Right to diſpoſe of it, it then became a Duty to part with it.</note>.</p>
            <p>WE never excuſe the abſolute Want of Spirit and
Dignity of Character, or a proper Senſe of what is
due to one's ſelf, in Society and the common Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0352600600:151"/>
of Life. This Vice conſtitutes what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
call <hi>Meanneſs;</hi> when a Man can ſubmit to the
baſeſt Slavery, in order to gain his Ends; fawn upon
thoſe, who abuſe him; and degrade himſelf by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacies
and Familiarities with undeſerving Inferiors.
A certain Degree of generous Pride or Self-value is
ſo requiſite, that the Abſence of it in the Mind diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes
after the ſame Manner, as the Want of a
Noſe, Eye, or any of the moſt material Features of
the Face or Members of the Body<note n="*" place="bottom">The Abſence of a Virtue may often be a Vice; and that of the higheſt Kind; as in the Inſtance of Ingratitude, as well as Meanneſs. Where we expect a Beauty, the Diſappointment gives an uneaſy Senſation, and produces a real Deformity. An Abject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Character, likewiſe, is diſguſtful and contemptible in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other View. Where a Man has no Senſe of Value in himſelf, we are not likely to have any higher Eſtimation of him. And if the ſame Perſon, who crouches to his Superiors, is inſolent to his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors (as often happens) this Contrariety of Behaviour, inſtead of correcting the former Vice, aggravates it extremely, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Vice, ſtill more odious.

Nations, which have not, as yet, had full
Experience of the Advantages, attending Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,

the predominant Excellence; what is moſt celebrated
by Poets, recommended by Parents and Inſtructors,
and admir'd by the Public in general. The Ethics
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0352600600:154"/>
of <hi>Homer</hi> are, in this Particular, very different from
thoſe of <hi>Fenelon,</hi> his elegant Imitator; and ſuch as
are well ſuited to an Age, wherein one Hero, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markt
by <hi>Thucydides</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1.</note>, could aſk another, without Offence, if he was a Robber or not. Such alſo,
very lately, was the Syſtem of Ethics, that prevail'd
in many barbarous Parts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> if we may
credit <hi>Spenſer,</hi> in his judicious Account of the State
of that Kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">It is a common Uſe, ſays he, amongſt their Gentlemen's Sons, that, as ſoon as they are able to uſe their Weapons, they ſtrait gather to themſelves three or four Stragglers or Kern, with whom wandering a while up and down idly the Country, taking only Meat, he at laſt falleth into ſome bad Occaſion, that ſhall be offer'd; which being once made known, he is thenceforth counted a Men of Worth, in whom there is Courage.</note>.</p>
            <p>OF the ſame Claſs of Virtues with Courage is that
undiſturb'd, philoſophical TRANQUILLITY,
ſuperior to Pain, Sorrow, Anxiety, and each Aſſault
of adverſe Fortune. Conſcious of his own Virtue,
ſay the Philoſophers, the Sage elevates himſelf above
every Accident of Life; and ſecurely plac'd in the
Temple of Wiſdom, looks down on inferior Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
engag'd in Purſuit of Honours, Riches, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and each frivolous Enjoyment. Theſe
Pretenſions, no doubt, when ſtretch'd to the utmoſt,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0352600600:155"/>
are much too magnificent for human Nature. They
carry, however, a Grandeur, with them, which
ſeizes the Spectator, and ſtrikes him with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the nearer we can approach, in Practice,
to this ſublime Tranquillity and Indifference (for we
muſt diſtinguiſh it from a ſtupid Inſenſibility) the
more ſecure Enjoyment ſhall we attain within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and the more Greatneſs of Mind ſhall we
diſcover to the World. The philoſophical Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
may, indeed, be conſider'd only as a Branch
of Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>WHO admires not <hi>Socrates;</hi> his perpetual Serenity
and Contentment, amidſt the greateſt Poverty and
domeſtic Vexations; his reſolute Contempt of Riches,
and magnanimous Care of preſerving Liberty,
while he refuſed all Aſſiſtance from his Friends and
Diſciples, and avoided even the Dependance of an
Obligation? <hi>Epictetus</hi> had not ſo much as a Door to
his little Houſe or Hovel; and therefore, ſoon loſt
his Iron Lamp, the only Furniture he had worth
taking. But reſolving to diſappoint all Robbers for
the future, he ſupply'd its Place with an earthen

IN Antiquity, the Heroes of Philoſophy, as well
as thoſe of War and Patriotiſm, have a Grandeur
and Force of Sentiment, which aſtoniſhes our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Souls, and is raſhly rejected as extravagant and
ſupernatural. They, in their Turn, I allow, would
have had equal Reaſon to conſider, as romantic and
incredible, the Degree of Humanity, Clemency,
Order, Tranquillity, and other ſocial Virtues, to
which, in the Adminiſtration of Government, we
have attain'd in modern Times, had any one been
then able to have made a fair Repreſentation of
them. Such is the Compenſation, which Nature,
or rather Education has made, in the Diſtribution of
Excellencies and Virtues, in theſe different Ages.</p>
            <p>THE Merit of BENEVOLENCE, ariſing from
its Utility, and its Tendency to the Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
has been already explain'd, and is, no doubt, the
Source of a <hi>conſiderable</hi> Part of that Eſteem, which is
ſo univerſally pay'd it But it will alſo be allow'd, that
the very Softneſs and Tenderneſs of the Sentiment,
its engaging Endearments, its fond Expreſſions, its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Attentions, and all that Flow of mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and Regard, which enter into a warm At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of Love and Friendſhip: It will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
I ſay, that theſe Feelings being delightful in
themſelves, are neceſſarily communicated to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0352600600:157"/>
Spectators, and melt them into the ſame Fondneſs
and Delicacy. The Tears naturally ſtart in our
Eyes on the Obſervation of a warm Sentiment of
this Nature: Our Breaſt heaves, our Heart is agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and every humane tender Principle of our Frame,
is ſet in Motion, and gives us the pureſt and moſt
ſatisfactory Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>WHEN Poets form Deſcriptions of <hi>Elyzian</hi> Fields,
where the bleſſed Inhabitants ſtand in no Need of
each other's Aſſiſtance, they yet repreſent them, as
maintaining a conſtant Entercourſe of Love and

Image of theſe ſoft and gentle Paſſions. The Idea

            <p>WHO would live amidſt perpetual Wrangling, and
Scolding, and mutual Reproaches? The Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Harſhneſs of theſe Emotions diſturb and
diſpleaſe us: We ſuffer by Contagion and Sympathy;
nor can we remain indifferent Spectators, even tho'
certain, that no pernicious Conſequences would ever
follow from ſuch angry Paſſions.</p>

As a certain Proof, that the whole Merit of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
is not deriv'd from its Uſefulneſs, we may
obſerve, that, in a kind Way of Blame, we ſay, a
Perſon is <hi>too good;</hi> when he exceeds his Part in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and carries his Attention for others beyond the
proper Bounds and Meaſure. In like Manner, we
ſay a Man is <hi>too high-ſpirited, too intrepid, too indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
about Fortune:</hi> Reproaches, which really, at the
bottom, imply more Regard and Eſteem than many
Panegyrics. Being accuſtom'd to rate the Merit and
Demerit of Characters chiefly by their uſeful or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Tendencies, we cannot forbear applying the
Epithet of Blame, when we diſcover a Sentiment,
which riſes to a Degree that is hurtful: But it may
happen, at the ſame Time, that its noble Elevation,
or its engaging Tenderneſs ſo ſeizes the Heart, as
rather to encreaſe our Friendſhip and Concern for
the Perſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Cheerfulneſs could ſtarce admit of Blame from its Exceſs, were it not, that diſſolute Mirth, without a proper Cauſe or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is a ſure Symptom and Characteriſtic of Folly, and on that Account, diſguſtful.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE Amours and Attachments of <hi>Harry</hi> the IVth,
during the civil Wars of the League, frequently hurt
his Intereſt and his Cauſe; but all the young, at
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0352600600:159"/>
leaſt, and amorous, who can ſympathize with that
Paſſion, will allow, that this very Weakneſs (for
they will readily call it ſuch) chiefly endears that
Hero, and intereſts them in his Fortunes.</p>
            <p>THE exceſſive Bravery and reſolute Inflexibility of
<hi>Charles</hi> the XIIth ruin'd his own Country, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
all his Neighbours: But have ſuch Splendour
and Greatneſs in their Appearance, as ſtrike us with
Admiration; and they might, in ſome Degree, be
even approv'd of, if they betray'd not ſometimes too
evident Symptoms of Madneſs and Diſorder.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Athenians</hi> pretended to the firſt Invention of
Agriculture and of Laws; and always valu'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
extremely on the Benefit thereby procur'd to
the whole Race of Mankind. They alſo boaſted,
and with Reaſon, of their warlike Enterprizes;
particularly againſt thoſe innumerable Fleets and
Armies of <hi>Perſians,</hi> which invaded <hi>Greece</hi> during
the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> and of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> But tho' there
be no Compariſon, in Point of Utility, betwixt theſe
peaceful and military Honours; yet we find, that
the Orators, who have wrote ſuch elaborate Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics
on that famous City, have chiefly triumph'd in
diſplaying the warlike Atchievments. <hi>Lyſias, Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,
Plato</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> diſcover, all of them, the
ſame Partiality: which, tho' condemn'd by calm
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0352600600:160"/>
Reaſon and Reflection, appears ſo natural in the
Mind of Man.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, that the great Charm of Poetry
conſiſts in lively Pictures of the ſublime Paſſions,
Magnanimity, Courage, Diſdain of Fortune; or
thoſe of the tender Affections, Love and Friendſhip;
which warm the Heart, and diffuſe over us ſimilar
Sentiments and Emotions. And tho' every Kind of
Paſſion, even the moſt diſagreeable, ſuch as Grief
and Anger, are obſerv'd, when excited by Poetry,
to convey a Pleaſure and Satisfaction, from a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm
of Nature, not eaſy to be explain'd: Yet
thoſe more elevated or ſofter Affections have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Influence, and pleaſe from more than one Cauſe
or Principle. Not to mention, that they alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
us in the Fortune of the Perſons repreſented,
or communicate any Eſteem and Affection for their
Character.</p>
            <p>AND can it poſſibly be doubted, that this Talent
itſelf of Poets, to move the Paſſions, this PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THETIC
and SUBLIME of Sentiment, is a
very conſiderable Merit, and being enhanc'd by its
extreme Rarity, may exalt the Perſon poſſeſt of it,
above every Character of the Age, in which he
lives? The Prudence, Addreſs, Steadineſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
Government of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> adorn'd with all the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0352600600:161"/>
Splendour of his noble Birth and imperial Crown,
render him but an unequal Competitor for Fame
with <hi>Virgil,</hi> who lays nothing into the oppoſite Scale
but the divine Beauties of his poetical Genius.</p>
            <p>THE very Senſibility to theſe Beauties or a
DELICACY of Taſte, is itſelf a Beauty in any
Character; as conveying the pureſt, the moſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and moſt innocent of all Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome Inſtances of the Species of
Virtue, that are prais'd from the immediate Pleaſure,
which they communicate to the Perſon, poſſeſt of
them. No Views of Utility or of future beneficial
Conſequences enter into this Sentiment of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
yet is it of a ſimilar Kind to that other
Sentiment, which ariſes from Views of public or
private Utility. The ſame ſocial Sympathy, we may
obſerve, or Fellow-feeling with human Happineſs or
Miſery, gives Riſe to both; and this Analogy in all
the Parts of the preſent Theory may juſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as a Confirmation of it.</p>

            <p>AS the mutual Shocks, in <hi>Society,</hi> and the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of Intereſt and Self-love have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
Mankind to eſtabliſh the Laws of <hi>Juſtice;</hi>
in order to preſerve the Advantages of common Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
and Protection: in like Manner, the eternal
Contrarieties, in <hi>Company,</hi> of Men's Pride and Self-conceit
have introduc'd the Rules of GOOD-MANNERS
or POLITENESS, in order to
facilitate the Intercourſe of Minds, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd
Commerce and Converſation. Amongſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0352600600:163"/>
well-bred People, a mutual Deference is affected;
Contempt of others diſguis'd: Authority conceal'd:
Attention given to each in his Turn: And an eaſy
Stream of Converſation maintain'd, without Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
without mutual Interruption, without Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for Victory, and without any Airs of Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Theſe Attentions and Regards are immediately
<hi>agreeable</hi> to others, abſtracted from any Regard to
Utility or beneficial Tendencies: They conciliate
Affection, promote Eſteem, and enhance extremely
the Merit of the Perſon, who regulates his Behaviour
by them.</p>
            <p>MANY of the Forms of Breeding are arbitrary
and caſual: But the Thing expreſt by them is ſtill
the ſame. A <hi>Spaniard</hi> goes out of his own Houſe
before his Gueſt, to ſignify, that he leaves him
Maſter of all. In other Countries, the Landlord
walks out laſt, as a common Mark of Deference and
Regard.</p>
            <p>BUT in order to render a Man perfect <hi>Good-company,</hi>
he muſt have WIT and INGENUITY as well as
Good-manners. What Wit is, it may not be eaſy to
define; but 'tis eaſy ſurely to determine, that 'tis a
Quality immediately <hi>agreeable</hi> to others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating,
on its firſt Appearance, a lively Joy and
Satisfaction to every one, that has any Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0352600600:164"/>
of it. The moſt profound Metaphyſics, indeed,
might be employ'd, in explaining the various Kinds
and Species of Wit; and many Claſſes of it, which
are now receiv'd on the ſimple Teſtimony of Taſte
and Sentiment, might, perhaps, be reſolv'd into
more general Principles. But this is ſufficient for
our preſent Purpoſe, that it does affect Taſte and
Sentiment, and beſtowing an immediate Enjoyment,
is a ſure Source of Approbation and Affection.</p>
            <p>IN Countries, where Men paſs all their Time in
Converſation, and Viſits and Aſſemblies, theſe <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionable</hi>
Qualities, ſo to ſpeak, are of high Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and form a chief Part of perſonal Merit. In
Countries, where Men live a more domeſtic Life,
and either are employ'd in Buſineſs or amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a narrower Circle of Acquaintance, the
more ſolid Qualities are chiefly regarded. Thus, I
have obſerv'd, that, amongſt the <hi>French,</hi> the firſt
Queſtions, with regard to a Stranger, are, <hi>Is he
polite? Has he Wit?</hi> In our own Country, the
chief Praiſe beſtow'd is always that of a <hi>good-natur'd,
ſenſible Fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Converſation, the lively Spirit of Dialogue is
<hi>agreeable,</hi> even to thoſe who deſire not to have any
Share of the Diſcourſe: Hence a Teller of long
Stories or a pompous Declaimer is very little approv'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0352600600:165"/>
of. But moſt Men deſire likewiſe their Share in the
Converſation, and regard, with a very evil Eye,
that <hi>Loquacity,</hi> which deprives them of a Right they
are naturally ſo jealous of.</p>
            <p>THERE are a Set of harmleſs <hi>Lyars,</hi> frequently to
be met with in Company, who deal much in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
and Extraordinary. Their uſual Intention is to
pleaſe and entertain; but as Men are delighted with
nothing but what they conceive to be Truth, theſe
People miſtake extremely the Means of pleaſing,
and incur univerſal Blame. Some Indulgence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to Lying or Fiction is given in <hi>humourous</hi>
Stories; becauſe it is there agreeable and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining;
and Truth is not of any Importance.</p>
            <p>ELOQUENCE, Genius of all Kinds, even good
Senſe, and ſound Reaſoning, when it riſes to an
eminent Degree, and is employ'd upon Subjects of
any conſiderable Dignity and nice Diſcernment;
all theſe Qualities ſeem immediately agreeable, and
have a Merit diſtinct from their Uſefulneſs. Rarity,
likewiſe, which ſo much enhances the Price of every
Thing, muſt ſet an additional Value on theſe noble
Talents of the human Mind.</p>
            <p>MODESTY may be underſtood in different
Senſes, even abſtracted from Chaſtity, which has
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0352600600:166"/>
been already treated of. It ſometimes means that
Tenderneſs and Nicety of Honour, that Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Blame, that Dread of Intruſion or Injury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, that <hi>Pudor,</hi> which is the proper Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of every Kind of Virtue, and a ſure Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
againſt Vice and Corruption. But its moſt uſual
Meaning is, when it is oppos'd to <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance,</hi>
and expreſſes a Diffidence of our own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a due Attention and Regard to others.
In young Men chiefly, this Quality is a ſure Sign of
Good-ſenſe; and is alſo the certain Means of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
that Endowment, by preſerving their Ears
open to Inſtruction, and making them ſtill graſp after
new Attainments. But it has a farther Charm to
every Spectator; by flattering each Man's Vanity,
and preſenting the Appearance of a docile Pupil,
who receives, with proper Attention and Reſpect,
every Word they utter<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Men have in general a much greater Propenſity to over-value than under-value themſelves; notwithſtanding the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> This makes us more jealous of the Exceſs on the former Side, and cauſes us to regard, with a particular Indulgence, all Tendency to Modeſty and Self-diffidence; as eſteeming the Danger leſs of falling into any vicious Extreme of that Nature. 'Tis thus, in Countries, where Men's Bodies are apt to exceed in Corpulency, perſonal Beauty is plac'd in a much greater Degree of Slenderneſs, than in Countries where that is the moſt uſual Defect. Being ſo often ſtruck with Inſtances of one Species of Deformity, Men think they can never keep at too great a Diſtance from it, and wiſh always to have a Leaning to the oppoſite Side. In like Manner, were the Door open'd to Self-praiſe, and were <hi>Montaigne</hi>'s Maxim obſerv'd, that one ſhould ſay as frankly, <hi>I have Senſe, I have Learning, I have Courage, Beauty, or Wit;</hi> as 'tis ſure we often think ſo; were this the Caſe, I ſay, every one is ſenſible, that ſuch a Flood of Impertinence would break in upon us as would render Society altogether intolerable. For this Reaſon Cuſtom has eſtabliſh'd it as a Rule, in common Societies, that Men ſhould never praiſe themſelves, and not even ſpeak much of themſelves; and 'tis only amongſt intimate Friends or People of very manly Behaviour, that one is allow'd to do himſelf Juſtice. No body finds fault with <hi>Maurice,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for his Reply to one, who aſk'd him whom he eſteem'd the firſt General of the Age, <hi>The Marquis de</hi> Spinola, ſaid he, <hi>is the ſecond.</hi> Tho' 'tis even obſervable, that the Self-praiſe imply'd is here better imply'd, than if it had been directly expreſs'd, without any Cover or Diſguiſe.</p>
                  <p>He muſt be a very ſuperficial Thinker, who imagines, that all Inſtances of mutual Deference are to be underſtood in earneſt, and that a Man would be more eſteemable for being ignorant of his own Merits and Accompliſhments. A ſmall Byaſs towards Modeſty, even in the internal Sentiments, is favourably regarded, eſpecially in young People; and a ſtrong Byaſs is requir'd in the outward Behaviour: But this excludes not a noble Pride and Spirit, which may openly diſplay itſelf in its full Extent, when one lies under Calumny or Oppreſſion of any Kind. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Contumacy of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it, has been highly celebrated in all Ages; and when join'd to the uſual Modeſty of his Behaviour, forms a moſt ſhining Character. <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0352600600:167"/>
A DESIRE of Fame, Reputation, or a Character
with others, is ſo far from being blameable, that it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0352600600:168"/>
ſeems inſeparable from Virtue, Genius, Capacity,
and a generous or noble Diſpoſition. An Attention,
even to trivial Matters, in order to pleaſe, is alſo
expected and demanded by Society; and no one is
ſurpriz'd, if he finds a Man in Company, to obſerve
a greater Elegance of Dreſs and more pleaſant Flow
of Converſation, than when he paſſes his Time, at
home, and altogether with his own Family. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
then, conſiſts VANITY, which is ſo juſtly
regarded as a Fault or Imperfection? It ſeems to
conſiſt chiefly in ſuch an intemperate Diſplay of our
Advantages, Honours and Accompliſhments; in
ſuch an importunate and open Demand of Praiſe and
Admiration, as is offenſive to others, and encroaches
too far on <hi>their</hi> ſecret Vanity and Ambition It is
beſides a ſure Symptom of the Want of true Dignity
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0352600600:169"/>
and Elevation of Mind, which is ſo great an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to any Character. For why that impatient
Deſire of Applauſe; as if you were not juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
to it, and might not reaſonably expect it would
for ever attend you? Why ſo anxious to inform us
of the great Company you have kept; the obliging
Things, that were ſaid to you; the Honours, the
Diſtinctions you met with; as if theſe were not
Things of Courſe, and what we could readily, of
ourſelves, have imagin'd, without being told of
them?</p>
            <p>DECENCY, or a proper Regard to Age, Sex,
Character and Station in the World, may be rank'd
among the Qualities, which are immediately agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to others, and which, by that Means, acquire
Praiſe and Approbation. An effeminate Behaviour
in a Man, a rough Manner in a Woman; theſe are
ugly, becauſe unſuitable to each Character, and
different from the Qualities we expect in the Sexes.
'Tis as if a Tragedy abounded in comic Beauties,
or a Comedy in tragic. The Diſproportions hurt the
Eye, and convey a diſagreeable Sentiment to the
Spectators, the Source of Blame and Diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is that <hi>Indecorum,</hi> which is explain'd ſo
much at large by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Offices.</p>

               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0352600600:170"/>
AMONGST the other Virtues, we may alſo give
CLEANLINESS a Place; ſince it naturally
renders us agreeable to others, and is no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Source of Love and Affection. No one will
deny, that a Negligence in this Particular is a Fault;
and as Faults are nothing but ſmaller Vices, and this
Fault can have no other Origin than the uneaſy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
which it excites in others; we may, in this
Inſtance, ſeemingly ſo trivial, clearly diſcover the
Origin of moral Diſtinctions, about which the
Learned have involved themſelves in ſuch Mazes of
Perplexity and Error.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides all the <hi>agreeable</hi> Qualities, the Origin
of whoſe Beauty we can, in ſome Degree, explain
and account for, there ſtill remains ſomething myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and unaccountable, which conveys an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Satisfaction to the Spectators, but how, or
why, or for what Reaſon, they cannot pretend to
determine. There is a MANNER, a Grace, a
Genteelneſs, an I-know-not-what, which ſome Men
poſſeſs above others, which is very different from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Beauty and Comelineſs, and which, however,
catches our Affection almoſt as ſuddenly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
And tho' this <hi>Manner</hi> be chiefly talk'd of in
the Paſſion betwixt the Sexes, where the conceal'd
Magic is eaſily explain'd, yet ſurely much of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0352600600:171"/>
in all our Eſtimation of Characters, and forms
no inconſiderable Part of perſonal Merit. This Claſs
of Virtues, therefore, muſt be truſted entirely to the
blind, but ſure Teſtimony of Taſte and Sentiment;
and muſt be conſider'd as a Part of Ethics, left by
Nature to baffle all the Pride of Philoſophy, and
make her ſenſible of her narrow Boundaries and
ſlender Acquiſitions.</p>
            <p>WE approve of another, becauſe of his Wit, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs,

he poſſeſſes, although he be not of our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
nor has ever given us any Entertainment, by
Means of theſe Accompliſhments. The Idea, which
we form of their Effect on his Acquaintance, has an
agreeable Influence on our Imagination, and gives us
the Sentiment of Approbation. This Principle enters
into all the Judgments, which we form concerning
Morals.</p>

the Image is reflected, diſturb'd and confus'd, a juſt
Figure is immediately preſented, without any Art

in common Life, theſe Principles are ſtill
implicitely maintain'd; nor is any other Topic of
Praiſe or Blame ever recur'd to, when we employ
any Panegyric or Satyre, any Applauſe or Cenſure

ſure of <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> Treatment<note n="*" place="bottom">Qualities uſeful to others.</note>. I congratulate
you too, ſays another, on the promiſing Expectations
of this Son-in-law; whoſe aſſiduous Application to
the Sudy of the Laws, whoſe quick Penetration and
early Knowledge both of Men and Buſineſs, prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate
the greateſt Honours and Advancement<note n="†" place="bottom">Qualities uſeful to the Perſon himſelf.</note>.
You ſurprize me much, replies a third, when you
talk of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> as a Man of Buſineſs and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
I met him lately in a Circle of the gayeſt
Company, and he was the very Life and Soul of
our Converſation: So much Wit with Good-manners;
ſo much Gallantry without Affectation; ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Knowledge ſo genteely deliver'd, I have
never before obſerv'd in any one<note n="‡" place="bottom">Qualities immmediately agreeable to others.</note>. You would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him ſtill more, ſays a fourth, if you knew him
more familiarly. That Cheerfulneſs, which you
might remark in him, is not a ſudden Flaſh ſtruck
out by Company: It runs thro' the whole Tenor of
his Life, and preſerves a perpetual Serenity on his
Countenance, and Tranquillity in his Soul. He has
met with ſevere Trials, Misfortunes as well as
Dangers; and by his Greatneſs of Mind, was ſtill
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0352600600:175"/>
ſuperior to all of them<note n="*" place="bottom">Qualities immediately agreeable to the Perſon himſelf.</note>. The Image, Gentlemen,
you have here delineated of <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> cry I, is that
of accompliſh'd Merit. Each of you has given a
Stroke of the Pencil to his Figure; and you have
unawares exceeded all the Pictures drawn by <hi>Gratian</hi>
or <hi>Caſtiglione.</hi> A Philoſopher might ſelect this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
as a Model of perfect Virtue.</p>
               <p>AND as every Quality, which is uſeful or agreeable
to ourſelves or others, is, in common Life, admitted
under the Denomination of Virtue or perſonal
Merit; ſo no other will ever be receiv'd, where
Men judge of Things by their natural, unprejudic'd
Reaſon, without the deluſive Gloſſes of Superſtition
and falſe Religion. Celibacy, Faſting, Penances,
Mortification, Self-denial, Humility, Silence, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
and the whole Train of monkiſh Virtues;
for what Reaſon are they every where rejected by
Men of Senſe, but becauſe they ſerve no Manner of
Purpoſe; neither advance a Man's Fortune in the
World, nor render him a more valuable Member of
Society; neither qualify him for the Entertainment
of Company, nor encreaſe his Power of Self-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment?
We obſerve, on the contrary, that they
croſs all theſe deſirable Ends; ſtupify the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and harden the Heart, obſcure the Fancy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0352600600:176"/>
and ſower the Temper. We juſtly, therefore trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to the oppoſite Column, and place them in
the Catalogue of Vices; nor has any Superſtition
Force ſufficient, amongſt Men of the World, to
pervert entirely theſe natural Sentiments. A gloomy,
hair-brain'd Enthuſiaſt, after his Death, may have
Place in the Calendar; but will ſcarce ever be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
when alive, into Intimacy and Society, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by thoſe who are as delirious and diſmal as
himſelf.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems a Happineſs in the preſent Theory, that
it enters not into that vulgar Diſpute concerning the
<hi>Degrees</hi> of Benevolence or Self-love, which prevail
in human Nature; a Diſpute, which is never likely
to have any Iſſue, both becauſe Men, who have
taken Party, are not eaſily convinc'd, and becauſe
the Phaenomena, which can be produc'd on either
Side, are ſo diſpers'd, ſo uncertain, and ſubject to ſo
many Interpretations, that 'tis ſcarce poſſible accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
to compare them, or draw from them any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Inference or Concluſion. 'Tis ſufficient
for our preſent Purpoſe, if it be allow'd, what ſurely,
without the greateſt Abſurdity, cannot be diſputed,
that there is ſome Benevolence, however ſmall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
into our Boſom; ſome Spark of Friendſhip for
human Kind; ſome Particle of the Dove, kneaded
into our Frame, along with the Elements of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0352600600:177"/>
Wolf and Serpent. Let theſe generous Sentiments
be ſuppos'd ever ſo weak; let them be hardly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to move even a Hand or Finger of our Body;
they muſt ſtill direct the Determinations of our Mind,
and where every Thing elſe is equal, produce a cool
Preference of what is uſeful and ſerviceable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
above what is pernicious and dangerous. A
<hi>moral Diſtinction,</hi> therefore, immediately ariſes; a
general Sentiment of Blame and Approbation; a
Tendency, however faint, to the Objects of the one,
and a proportionable Averſion to thoſe of the other.
Nor will thoſe Reaſoners, who ſo earneſtly maintain
the predominant Selfiſhneſs of human Kind, be any
way ſcandaliz'd at hearing of the weak Sentiments
of Virtue, implanted in our Nature. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they are found as ready to maintain the one
Tenet as the other; and their Spirit of Satyre, (for
ſuch it appears, rather than of Corruption) naturally
gives Riſe to both Opinions; which have, indeed,
a great, and almoſt indiſſoluble Connexion together.</p>
               <p>AVARICE, Ambition, Vanity, and all Paſſions,
vulgarly, tho' improperly, compriz'd under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of <hi>Self-love,</hi> are here excluded from our
Theory concerning the Origin of Morals, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are too weak, but becauſe they have not
a proper Direction, for that Purpoſe. The Notion
of Morals implies ſome Sentiment, common to all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0352600600:178"/>
Mankind, which recommends the ſame Object to
general Approbation, and makes every Man, or
moſt Men, agree in the ſame Opinion or Deciſion
concerning it. It alſo implies ſome Sentiment, ſo
univerſal and comprehenſive as to extend to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and render the Actions and Conduct, even of
Perſons the moſt remote, an Object of Cenſure or
Applauſe, according as they agree or diſagree with
that Rule of Right, which is eſtabliſh'd. Theſe two
requiſite Circumſtances belong alone to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Humanity here inſiſted on. The other
Paſſions produce, in every Breaſt, many ſtrong Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of Deſire and Averſion, Affection and
Hatred; but theſe neither are felt ſo much in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
nor are ſo comprehenſive, as to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of any general Syſtem and eſtabliſh'd Theory
of Blame or Approbation.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Man denominates another his <hi>Enemy,</hi> his
<hi>Rival,</hi> his <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> his <hi>Adverſary,</hi> he is underſtood
to ſpeak the Language of Self-love, and to expreſs
Sentiments, peculiar to himſelf, and ariſing from his
particular Circumſtances and Situation: But when
he beſtows on any Man the Epithets of <hi>vicious</hi> or
<hi>odious</hi> or <hi>deprav'd,</hi> he then ſpeaks another Language,
and expreſſes Sentiments, in which he expects all his
Audience are to concur with him. He muſt here,
therefore, depart from his private and particular
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0352600600:179"/>
Situation, and muſt chooſe a Point of View, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to him with others: He muſt move ſome uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Principle of the human Frame, and touch a
String, to which all Mankind have an Accord and
Symphony. If he means, therefore, to expreſs,
that this Man poſſeſſes Qualities, whoſe Tendency is
pernicious to Society, he has choſen this common
Point in View, and has touch'd the Principle of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
in which every Man, in ſome Degree,
concurs. While the human Heart is compounded of
the ſame Elements as at preſent, it will never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
indifferent to the Good of Mankind, nor
entirely unaffected with the Tendencies of Characters
and Manners. And tho' this Affection of Humanity
may not generally be eſteem'd ſo ſtrong, as Ambition
or Vanity, yet, being common to all Men, it can
alone be the Foundation of Morals, or of any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Syſtem of Conduct and Behaviour. One Man's
Ambition is not another's Ambition; nor will the
ſame Event or Object ſatisfy both: But the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of one Man is the Humanity of every one; and
the ſame Object touches this Paſſion in all human
Creatures.</p>
               <p>BUT the Sentiments, which ariſes from Humanity,
are not only the ſame in all human Creatures, and
produce the ſame Approbation or Cenſure; but they
alſo comprehend all human Creatures; nor is there
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0352600600:180"/>
any one, whoſe Conduct and Character is not, by
their Means, an Object, to every one, of Cenſure
or Approbation. On the contrary thoſe other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
commonly denominated ſelfiſh, both produce
different Sentiments in each Individual, according to
his particular Situation; and alſo contemplate the
greateſt Part of Mankind with the utmoſt Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Unconcern. Whoever has a high Regard
and Eſteem for me flatters my Vanity; whoever
expreſſes Contempt mortifies and diſpleaſes me: But
as my Name is known but to a ſmall Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
there are few, that come within the Sphere of
this Paſſion, or excite, on its Account, either my
Affection or Diſguſt. But if you repreſent a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
inſolent, or barbarous Behaviour, in any
Country or in any Age of the World; I ſoon carry
my Eye to the pernicious Tendency of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and feel the Sentiments of Repugnance and
Diſpleaſure towards it. No Character can be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
as to be, in this Light, altogether indifferent
to me. What is beneficial to Society or to the
Perſon himſelf muſt ſtill be prefer'd. And every
Quality or Action, of every human Being, muſt,
by this Means, be rank'd under ſome Claſs or
Denomination, expreſſive of general Cenſure or
Applauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0352600600:181"/>
WHAT more, therefore, can we aſk to diſtinguiſh
the Sentiments, dependant on Humanity, from thoſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

pleaſes only theſe Paſſions in me, and affects
not the Avarice or Ambition of the reſt of Mankind.
No Conduct, in any Man. which has a beneficial
Tendency, but is agreeable to my Humanity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
remote the Perſon: But every Man, ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
as neither to croſs nor ſerve my Avarice and
Ambition, is altogether indifferent to thoſe Paſſions.
The Diſtinction, therefore, betwixt thoſe different
Species of Sentiment being ſo ſtrong and evident,
Language muſt ſoon be moulded upon it, and muſt
invent a peculiar Set of Terms to expreſs thoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Sentiments of Cenſure or Approbation, which
ariſe from Humanity or from Views of general Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and its contrary. VIRTUE and VICE
become then known: Morals are recogniz'd: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
general Ideas are fram'd of human Conduct and
Behaviour: Such Meaſures are expected from Men,
in ſuch Situations: This Action is determin'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0352600600:182"/>
to our abſtract Rule; that other, contrary.
And by ſuch univerſal Principles are the particular
Sentiments of Self-love frequently controul'd and
limited<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems certain, both from Reaſon and Experience, that a rude, untaught Savage regulates chiefly his Love and Hatred by the Ideas of private Utility and Injury, and has but faint Conceptions of a general Rule or Syſtem of Behaviour. The Man, who ſtands oppoſite to him in Battle, he hates heartily, not only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Moment, which is almoſt unavoidable, but for ever after; not is he ſatisfy'd without the moſt extreme Puniſhment and Vengeance. But we, accuſtom'd to Society and to more enlarg'd Reflections, conſider, that this Man is ſerving his own Country and Community; that any Man, in the ſame Situation, would do the ſame; that we ourſelves, in like Circumſtances, obſerve a like Conduct; that in general human Society is beſt ſupported on ſuch Maxims: And by theſe Suppoſitions and Views, we correct, in ſome Meaſure, our ruder and narrower Paſſions. And tho' much of our Friendſhip and Enmity be ſtill regulated by private Conſiderations of Benefit and Harm, we pay, at leaſt, this Homage to general Rules, which we are accuſtom'd to reſpect, that we commonly pervert our Adverſary's Conduct, by imputing Malice or Injuſtice to him, in order to give Vent to thoſe Paſſions, which ariſe from Self-love and private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. When the Heart is full of Rage, it never wants Pretexts of this Nature; tho' ſometimes as frivolous, as thoſe, from which <hi>Horace,</hi> being almoſt cruſh'd by the Fall of a Tree, affects to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of Parricide the firſt Planter of it.</note>.</p>
               <p>FROM Inſtances of popular Tumults, Seditions,
Factions, Panics, and all Paſſions, which are ſhar'd
with a Multitude; we may learn the Influence of
Society, in exciting and ſupporting any Emotion;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0352600600:183"/>
while the moſt ungovernable Diſorders are rais'd,
we find, by that Means, from the ſlighteſt and moſt
frivolous Occaſions. <hi>Solon</hi> was no very cruel, tho',
perhaps, an unjuſt Legiſlator, who puniſh'd Neuters
in civil Wars; and few, I believe, would, in ſuch
Caſes, incur the Penalty, were their Affection and
Diſcourſe allow'd ſufficient to abſolve them. No
Selfiſhneſs, and ſcarce any Philoſophy, has there
Force ſufficient to ſupport a total Coolneſs and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
and he muſt be more or leſs than Man,
who kindles not in the common Blaze. What Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then, that moral Sentiments are found of ſuch
Influence in Life; tho' ſpringing from Principles,
which may appear, at firſt Sight, ſomewhat ſmall
and delicate? But theſe Principles, we muſt remark,
are ſocial and univerſal: They form, in a Manner,
the <hi>Party</hi> of Human-kind againſt Vice or Diſorder,
its common Enemy: And as the benevolent Concern
for others is diffus'd, in a greater or leſs Degree,
over all Men, and is the ſame in all, it occurs more
frequently in Diſcourſe, is foſter'd by Society and
Converſation, and the Blame and Approbation,
conſequent on it, are thereby rouz'd from that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy,
into which they are probably lull'd, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and uncultivated Nature. Other Paſſions, tho'
perhaps originally ſtronger, yet being ſelfiſh and
private, are often over-power'd by its Force, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0352600600:184"/>
yield the Dominion of our Breaſt to thoſe ſocial and
public Principles.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Spring of our Conſtitution, that brings
great Addition of Force to moral Sentiment, is, the
Love of Fame; which rules, with ſuch uncontrol'd
Authority, in all generous Minds, and is often the
grand Object of all their Deſigns and Undertakings.
By our continual and earneſt Purſuit of a Character,
a Name, a Reputation in the World, we bring our
own Deportment and Conduct frequently in Review,
and conſider how they appear in the Eyes of thoſe,
who approach and regard us. This conſtant Habit
of ſurveying ourſelf, as it were, in Reflexion, keeps
alive all the Sentiments of Right and Wrong, and
begets, in noble Natures, a certain Reverence for
themſelves as well as others; which is the ſureſt
Guardian of every Virtue. The animal Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
and Pleaſures ſink gradually in their Value;
while every inward Beauty and moral Grace is ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
acquir'd, and the Mind is accompliſh'd in each
Perfection, that can adorn or embelliſh a rational
Creature.</p>
               <p>HERE is the moſt perfect Morality we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with: Here is diſplay'd the Force of many
Sympathies. Our moral Sentiment is itſelf a Feeling
chiefly of that Nature: And our Regard to a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0352600600:185"/>
with others ſeems to ariſe only from a Care of
preſerving a Character with ourſelves, in order to
which we find it neceſſary to prop our tottering
Judgment on the correſpondent Approbation of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>BUT in order to accommodate Matters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
if poſſible, every Difficulty, let us allow all
theſe Reaſonings to be falſe. Let us allow, that
when we reſolve the Pleaſure, that ariſes from Views
of Utility, into the Sentiments of Humanity and
Sympathy, we have embrac'd a wrong Hypotheſis.
Let us confeſs it neceſſary to find ſome other Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that Applauſe, which is paid to all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whether inanimate, animate or rational, if
they have a Tendency to promote the Welfare and
Advantage of others. However difficult it be to
conceive, that an Object is approv'd of, on Account
of its Tendency to a certain End, while the End
itſelf is totally indifferent; let us ſwallow this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
and conſider what are the Conſequences.
The preceding Delineation or Definition of VIRTUE
muſt ſtill retain its Evidence and Authority: It muſt
ſtill be allow'd, that every Quality of the Mind,
which is <hi>uſeful</hi> or <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Perſon himſelf</hi> or to
<hi>others,</hi> communicates a Pleaſure to the Spectator,
engages his Eſteem, and is admitted under the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Denomination of Virtue or Merit. Are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0352600600:186"/>
not Juſtice, Fidelity, Honour, Veracity, Allegiance,
Chaſtity eſteem'd ſolely on Account of their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to promote the Good of Society? Is not that
Tendency inſeperable from Humanity, Benevolence,
Lenity, Generoſity, Gratitude, Moderation, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
Friendſhip, and all the other ſocial Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues?
Can it poſſibly be doubted, that Induſtry,
Diſcretion, Frugality, Secrecy, Order, Perſeverance,
Forethought, Judgment, and that whole Claſs of
Virtues, of which many Pages would not contain
the Catalogue; can it be be doubted, I ſay, that
the Tendency of theſe Virtues to promote the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and Happineſs of their Poſſeſſor is the ſole
Foundation of their Merit? Who can diſpute that
a Mind, which ſupports a perpetual Serenity and
Cheerfulneſs, a noble Dignity and undaunted Spirit,
a tender Affection and Good-will to all around; as
it has more Enjoyment within itſelf, is alſo a
more animating and rejoicing Spectacle, than if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with Melancholy, tormented with Anxiety,
irritated with Rage, or ſunk into the moſt abject
Baſeneſs and Degeneracy? And as to the Qualities,
immediately <hi>agreeable to others,</hi> they ſpeak ſufficiently
for themſelves; and he muſt be unhappy, indeed,
either in his own Temper, or in his Situation and
Circumſtances, who has never perceiv'd the Charms
of a facetious Wit or flowing Affability, of a delicate
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0352600600:187"/>
Modeſty or decent Genteelneſs of Addreſs and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>I AM ſenſible, that nothing can be more unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
than to be poſitive or dogmatical on any
Subject; and that, even if <hi>exceſſive</hi> Scepticiſm could
be maintain'd, it would not be more deſtructive to
all juſt Reaſoning and Enquiry. I am convinc'd,
that, where Men are the muſt ſure and arrogant, they
are commonly the moſt miſtaken, and have there
given Reins to Paſſion, without that proper Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Suſpence, which can alone ſecure them from
the groſſeſt Abſurdities. Yet I muſt confeſs, that
this Enumeration puts the Matter in ſo ſtrong a
Light, that I cannot, <hi>at preſent,</hi> be more aſſur'd of
any Truth, which I learn from Reaſoning and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
than that Virtue conſiſts altogether in the
Uſefulneſs or Agreeableneſs of Qualities to the
Perſon himſelf, poſſeſt of them, or to others, who
have any Intercourſe with him. But when I reflect,
that, tho' the Bulk and Figure of the Earth have
been meaſur'd and delineated, tho' the Motions of the
Tides have been accounted for, the Order and
Oeconomy of the heavenly Bodies ſubjected to their
proper Laws, and INFINITE itſelf reduc'd to
Calculation; yet Men ſtill diſpute concerning the
Foundation of their moral Duties: When I reflect
on this, I ſay, I fall back into Diffidence and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0352600600:188"/>
and ſuſpect, that an Hypotheſis, ſo obvious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
had it been a true one, would, long 'ere now, have
been receiv'd, by the unanimous Suffrage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of Mankind.</p>

               <p>THERE remains nothing, but to conſider
briefly our <hi>Obligation</hi> to Virtue, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
whether every Man, who has any Regard to
his own Happineſs and Welfare, will not beſt find
his Account in the Practice of every moral Duty. If
this can be clearly aſcertain'd from the foregoing
Theory, we ſhall have the Satisfaction to reflect,
that we have advanc'd Principles, which not only,
'tis hop'd, will ſtand the Teſt of Reaſoning and
Enquiry, but may contribute to the Amendment of
Men's Lives, and their Improvement in Morality
and ſocial Virtue. And tho' the philoſophical Truth
of any Propoſition by no Means depends on its
Tendency to promote the Intereſt of Society; yet a
Man has but a bad Grace, who delivers a Theory,
however true, which, he muſt confeſs, leads to a
Practice, dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into
thoſe Corners of Nature, which ſpread a Nuiſance
all around? Why dig up the Peſtilence from the
Pit, in which it is bury'd? The Ingenuity of your
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0352600600:189"/>
Reſearches may be admir'd; but your Syſtems will
be deteſted: And Mankind will agree, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refute them, to ſink them, at leaſt, in eternal
Silence and Oblivion: Truths, which are <hi>pernicious</hi>
to Society, if any ſuch there be, will yield to Errors,
which are ſalutary and <hi>advantageous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT what philoſophical Truths can be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to Society, than thoſe here deliver'd,
which repreſent Virtue in all her genuine and moſt
engaging Charms, and make us approach her with
Eaſe, Familiarity and Affection? The diſmal Dreſs
falls off, with which many Divines, and ſome Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
had cover'd her; and nothing appears but
Gentleneſs, Humanity, Beneficence, Affability; nay
even, at proper Intervals, Play, Frolic, and Gaiety.
She talks not of uſeleſs Auſterities and Rigors, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance
and Self-denial. She declares, that her ſole
Purpoſe is, to make her Votaries and all Mankind,
during every Inſtant of their Exiſtence, if poſſible,
cheerful and happy; nor does ſhe ever willingly part
with any Pleaſure but in Hopes of ample Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in ſome other Period of their Lives. The ſole
Trouble ſhe demands is that of juſt Calculation, and
a ſteady Preference of the greater Happineſs. And
if any auſtere Pretenders approach her, Enemies to
Joy and Pleaſure, ſhe either rejects them as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

Train, they are rank'd, however, among the leaſt
favour'd of her Votaries.</p>
               <p>AND indeed, to drop all figurative Expreſſion,
what Hopes can we ever have of engaging Mankind
to a Practice, which we confeſs full of Auſterity and
Rigour? Or what Morality can ever ſerve any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Purpoſe, unleſs it can ſhow, by a particular Detail,
that all the Duties it recommends, are alſo the true
Intereſt of each Individual? And the peculiar Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the foregoing Theory, ſeems to be, that
it furniſhes proper Mediums for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THAT the Virtues, which are immediately <hi>uſeful</hi>
or <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Perſon, poſſeſt of them, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
in a View to Self-intereſt, it would ſurely be
ſuperfluous to prove. Moraliſts, indeed, may ſpare
themſelves all the Pains they often take in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
theſe Duties. To what Purpoſe collect
Arguments to evince, that Temperance is advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
and the Exceſſes of Pleaſure hurtful? When
it appears, that theſe Exceſſes are only denominated
ſuch, becauſe they are hurtful; and that, if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
Uſe of ſtrong Liquors, for Inſtance, no
more impair'd Health or the Faculties of the Mind
and Body than the Uſe of Air or Water, it would
not be a whit more vicious or blameable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0352600600:191"/>
IT ſeems equally ſuperfluous to prove, that the
<hi>companionable</hi> Virtues of Good-manners and Wit,
Decency and Genteelneſs are more deſirable than
the contrary Qualities. Vanity alone, without other
Conſiderations, is a ſufficient Motive to make us
wiſh the Poſſeſſion of theſe Accompliſhments. No
Man was ever willingly deficient in this Particular.
All our Failures here proceed from bad Education,
Want of Capacity, or a perverſe and unpliable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
Would you have your Company coveted,
admir'd, follow'd; rather than hated, deſpis'd,
avoided? Can any one ſeriouſly deliberate in the
Caſe? As no Enjoyment is ſincere, without ſome
Reference to Company and Society; ſo no Society
can be agreeable or even tolerable, where a Man
feels his Preſence unwelcome, and diſcovers all
around him Symptoms of Averſion and Diſguſt.</p>
               <p>BUT why, in the greater Society or Confederacy
of Mankind, ſhould not the Caſe be the ſame as in
particular Clubs and Companies? Why is it more
doubtful, that the enlarg'd Virtues of Humanity,
Generoſity, Beneficence are deſirable with a View
to Happineſs and Self-intereſt, than the limited En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of Ingenuity and Politeneſs? Are we
apprehenſive, that thoſe ſocial Affections have a
greater and more immediate Interference, than any
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0352600600:192"/>
other Purſuits, with private Utility, and cannot be
gratify'd without ſome important Sacrifices of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Advantage? If ſo, we are but ill inſtructed
in the Nature of the human Paſſions, and are more
influenc'd by verbal Diſtinctions than by real Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER Contradiction, may vulgarly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
betwixt the <hi>ſocial</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Sentiments or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
they are really no more oppoſite than
ſelfiſh and ambitious, ſelfiſh and revengeful, ſelfiſh
and vain. 'Tis requiſite there be an original Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
of ſome Kind, in order to be a Baſis to Self-love,
by giving a Reliſh to the Objects of its Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit;
and none more fit for this Purpoſe than Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
or Humanity. The Goods of Fortune are
ſpent in one Gratification or other: The Miſer, who
accumulates his annual Income, and lends it out at
Intereſt, has really ſpent it in the Gratification of
his Avarice. And 'twould be difficult to ſhow, why
a Man is more a Loſer by a generous Action, than
by any other Method of Expence; ſince the utmoſt
he can attain, by the moſt elaborate Selfiſhneſs, is
the Indulgence of ſome Affection.</p>
               <p>NOW if Life, without Paſſion, muſt be altogether
inſipid and tireſome; let a Man ſuppoſe he has full
Power of modelling his own Diſpoſition, and let
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0352600600:193"/>
him deliberate what Appetite or Deſire he would
chooſe for the Foundation of his Happineſs and
Enjoyment. Every Affection, he would obſerve,
when gratify'd by Succeſs, gives a Satisfaction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
to its Force and Violence; but beſides this
Advantage, common to all, the immediate Feeling
of Benevolence and Friendſhip, Humanity and
Kindneſs, is ſweet, ſmooth, tender, and agreeable,
independent of all Fortune and Accidents. Theſe
Virtues are beſides attended with a pleaſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
and Remembrance, and keep us in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
with ourſelves as well as others; while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the agreeable Reflection of having done our
Part towards Mankind and Society. And tho' all
Men ſhow a Jealouſy of our Succeſs in the Purſuits
of Avarice or Ambition; yet are we almoſt ſure of
their Good-will and Good-wiſhes, ſo long as we
perſevere in the Paths of Virtue, and employ our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Execution of generous Plans and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
What other Paſſion is there, where we ſhall
find ſo many Advantages united; an agreeable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
a pleaſing Conſciouſneſs, a good Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
But of theſe Truths, we may obſerve, Men
are, of themſelves, pretty much convinc'd; nor are
they deficient in their Duty to Society, becauſe they
would not wiſh to be generous, friendly, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;
but becauſe they do not feel themſelves ſuch.</p>

TREATING Vice with the greateſt Candour, and
making it all poſſible Conceſſions, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that there is not, in any Inſtance, the ſmalleſt
Pretext for giving it the Preference above Virtue,
with a View to Self-intereſt; except, perhaps, in
the Caſe of Juſtice, where a Man, taking Things
in a certain Light, may often ſeem to be a Loſer by
his Integrity. And tho' 'tis acknowledg'd, that,
without a Regard to Property, no Society could
ſubſiſt; yet according to the imperfect Way, in which
human Affairs are conducted, a ſenſible Knave, in
particular Incidents, may think, that an Act of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or Infidelity will make a conſiderable Addition
to his Fortune, without cauſing any conſiderable
Breach in the ſocial Union and Confederacy. That
<hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy,</hi> may be a good general
Rule; but is liable to many Exceptions: And he,
it may, perhaps, be judg'd, conducts himſelf with
moſt Wiſdom, who obſerves the general Rule, and
takes Advantage of all the Exceptions.</p>
               <p>I MUST confeſs, that if a Man thinks, that this
Reaſoning much requires an Anſwer, 'twill be a
little difficult to find any, that will to him appear
ſatisfactory and convincing. If his Heart does not
rebel againſt ſuch pernicious Maxims, if he feels no
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0352600600:195"/>
Reluctance to the Thoughts of Villainy or Baſeneſs,
he has indeed loſt a conſiderable Motive to Virtue;
and we may expect, that his Practice will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to his Speculation. But in all ingenuous
Natures, the Antipathy to Treachery and Roguery
is too ſtrong to be counter-ballanc'd by any Views of
Profit or pecuniary Advantage. Inward Peace of
Mind, Conſciouſneſs of Integrity, a ſatisfactory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of our own Conduct; theſe are Circumſtances
very requiſite to Happineſs, and will be cheriſh'd and
cultivated by every honeſt Man, who feels the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of them.</p>
               <p>SUCH a one has, beſides, the frequent Satisfaction
of ſeeing Knaves, with all their pretended Cunning
and Ability, betray'd by their own Maxims; and
while they purpoſe to cheat only with Moderation
and Secrecy, a tempting Incident occurs, Nature is
frail, and they give into the Snare; whence they can
never extricate themſelves, without a total Loſs of
Reputation, and the Forfeiture of all future Truſt
and Confidence with Mankind.</p>
               <p>BUT were they ever ſo ſecret and ſucceſsful, the
honeſt Man, if he has any Tincture of Philoſophy,
or even common Obſervation and Reflection, will
diſcover, that they themſelves are, in the End, the

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0352600600:196"/>
Enjoyment of a Character, with themſelves at leaſt,

            <head type="sub">Concerning moral SENTIMENT.</head>
            <p>IF the foregoing Hypotheſis be receiv'd, 'twill
now be eaſy for us to determine the Queſtion firſt
ſtated<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. I.</note>, concerning the general Principles of Morals;
and tho' we poſtpon'd the Deciſion of that Queſtion,
leſt it ſhould then involve us in intricate Speculations,
which are totally unfit for moral Diſcourſes, we may
reſume it at preſent, and examine how far either
<hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Sentiment</hi> enters into all moral Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>THE chief Foundation of moral Praiſe being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to lie in the Uſefulneſs of any Quality or
Action; 'tis evident, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt enter for a
conſiderable Share in all Determinations of this
Kind; ſince nothing but that Faculty can inſtruct us
in the Tendency of Qualities and Actions, and point
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0352600600:198"/>
out their beneficial Conſequences to Society and to
their Poſſeſſors. In many Caſes, this is an Affair
liable to great Controverſy: Doubts may ariſe; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Intereſts occur; and a Preference muſt be
given to one Side, from very nice Views and a ſmall
Overballance of Utility. This is particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in Queſtions with regard to Juſtice; as is,
indeed, natural to ſuppoſe from that Species of Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which attends this Virtue<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix II.</note>. Were every ſingle
Inſtance of Juſtice, like that of Benevolence, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
and uſeful to Society; this would be a more
ſimple State of the Caſe, and ſeldom liable to great
Controverſy. But as ſingle Inſtances of Juſtice are
often pernicious, in their firſt and immediate Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
and as the Advantage to Society reſults only
from the Obſervance of the general Rule, and from
the Concurrence and Combination of ſeveral Perſons
in the ſame equitable Conduct; the Caſe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more intricate and involv'd. The various Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of Society; the various Conſequences of
any Practice; the various Intereſts, which may be
propos'd: Theſe on many Occaſions are doubtful,
and ſubject to great Diſcuſſion and Enquiry.
The Object of municipal Laws is to fix all
Queſtions with regard to Juſtice: The Debates of
Civilians; the Reflections of Politicians; the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0352600600:199"/>
of Hiſtories and public Records, are all
directed to the ſame Purpoſe. And a very accurate
<hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi> is often requiſite, to give the true
Determination, amidſt ſuch intricate Doubts ariſing
from obſcure or oppoſite Utilities.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' Reaſon, when fully aſſiſted and improv'd,
be ſufficient to inſtruct us in the pernicious or uſeful
Tendencies of Qualities and Actions; it is not alone
ſufficient to produce any moral Blame or Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Utility is only a Tendency to a certain End;
and were the End totally indifferent to us, we ſhould
feel the ſame Indifference towards the Means. 'Tis
requiſite a <hi>Sentiment</hi> ſhould here diſplay itſelf, in order
to give a Preference to the uſeful above the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Tendencies. This Sentiment can be no other
than a Feeling for the Happineſs of Mankind, and
a Reſentment of their Miſery; ſince theſe are the
different Ends, which Virtue and Vice have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to promote. Here therefore, <hi>Reaſon</hi> inſtructs
us in the ſeveral Tendencies of Actions, and <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
makes a Diſtinction in favour of thoſe, which
are uſeful and beneficial.</p>
            <p>THIS Partition betwixt the Faculties of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and Sentiment, in all moral Deciſions,
ſeems clear from the preceding Hypotheſis. But I
ſhall ſuppoſe that Hypotheſis falſe: 'Twill then be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0352600600:200"/>
requiſite to look out for ſome other Theory, that
may be ſatisfactory; and I dare venture to affirm,
that none ſuch will ever be found, as long as we
ſuppoſe Reaſon to be the ſole Source of Morals. To
prove this, it will be proper to weigh the five follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>I. 'Tis eaſy for a falſe Hypotheſis to maintain
ſome Appearance of Truth, while it keeps altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Generals, makes uſe of undefin'd Terms, and
employs Compariſons, inſtead of Inſtances. This
is particularly remarkable in that Philoſophy, which
aſcribes the Diſcernment of all moral Diſtinctions to
Reaſon alone without the Concurrence of Sentiment.
'Tis impoſſible, in any particular Inſtance, that this
Hypotheſis can ſo much as be render'd intelligible;
whatever ſpecious Figure it may make in general
Declamations and Diſcourſes. Examine the Crime
of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> for Inſtance; which has Place,
wherever we obſerve Good-will, expreſt and known,
along with Good-offices perform'd, on the one Side,
and a Return of Ill-will or Indifference, with Ill-offices
or Neglect, on the other: Anatomize all
theſe Circumſtances, and examine, by your Reaſon
alone, wherein conſiſts the Demerit or Blame: You
never will come to any Iſſue or Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0352600600:201"/>
REASON judges either of <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> or of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
Enquire then, <hi>firſt,</hi> where is that Matter of
Fact, which we here call <hi>Crime;</hi> point it out; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Time of its Exiſtence; deſcribe its
Eſſence or Nature; explain the Senſe or Faculty, to
which it diſcovers itſelf. It reſides in the Mind of
the Perſon, who is ungrateful. He muſt, therefore,
feel it and be conſcious of it. But nothing is there,
except the Paſſion of Ill-will or abſolute Indifference.
You cannot ſay, that theſe, of themſelves, always,
and in all Circumſtances, are Crimes. No: They
are only Crimes, when directed towards Perſons,
who have before expreſt and diſplay'd Good-will
towards us. Conſequently, we may infer, that the
Crime of Ingratitude is not any particular individual
<hi>Fact;</hi> but ariſes from a Complication of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which, being preſented to the Spectator,
excites the <hi>Sentiment</hi> of Blame, by the particular
Structure and Fabric of his Mind.</p>
            <p>THIS Repreſentation, you ſay, is falſe. Crime,
indeed, conſiſts not in a particular <hi>Fact,</hi> of whoſe
Reality we are aſſur'd by <hi>Reaſon:</hi> But it conſiſts in
certain <hi>moral Relations,</hi> diſcoverable by Reaſon, in
the ſame Manner as we diſcover, by Reaſon, the
Truths of Geometry or Algebra. But what are
the Relations, I aſk, of which you here talk? In
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0352600600:202"/>
the Caſe ſtated above, I ſee firſt Good-will and Good-offices,
in one Perſon; then Ill-will and Ill-offices
in the other: Betwixt theſe, there is the Relation
of <hi>Contrariety.</hi> Does the Crime conſiſt in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?
But ſuppoſe a Perſon bore me Ill-will or
did me Ill-offices; and I, in return, were indifferent
towards him, or did him Good-offices: Here is the
ſame Relation of <hi>Contrariety;</hi> and yet my Conduct
is highly laudable. Twiſt and turn this Matter, as
much as you will, you can never reſt the Morality
on Relation; but muſt have Recourſe to the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Sentiment.</p>
            <p>WHEN 'tis affirm'd, that two and three are equal
to the half of ten; this Relation of Equality, I
underſtand perfectly. I conceive, that if ten be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into two Parts, of which one had as many
Unites as the other; and if any of theſe Parts be
compar'd to two added to three, it will contain as
many Unites as that compound Number. But when
you draw thence a Compariſon to moral Relations,
I own, I am altogether at a loſs to underſtand you.
A moral Action, a Crime, ſuch as Ingratitude, is a
complicated Object. Does the Morality conſiſt in
the Relation of its Parts to each other. How?
After what Manner? Specify the Relation: Be
more particular and explicite in your Propoſitions;
and you will eaſily ſee their Falſhood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0352600600:203"/>
NO, ſay you, the Morality conſiſts in the Relation
of Action to the Rule of Right; and they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
good or ill, according as they agree or
diſagree with it. What then is this Rule of Right?
Wherein does it conſiſt? How is it determin'd?
By Reaſon, you'll ſay, which examines the moral
Relations of Actions. So that moral Relations are
determin'd by the Compariſon of Actions to a Rule.
And the Role is determin'd by conſidering the
moral Relations of Objects. Is not this fine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning?</p>
            <p>ALL this is Metaphyſics, you cry. That is
enough: There needs nothing more to give a ſtrong
Preſumption of Falſhood. Yes, reply I: Here are
Metaphyſics ſurely: But they are all on your Side,
who advance an abſtruſe Hypotheſis, which can
never be made intelligible, nor quadrate to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inſtance or Illuſtration. The Hypotheſis we
embrace is plain. It maintains, that Morality is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
by Sentiment. It defines Virtue to be,
<hi>whatever mental Action or Quality gives to a Spectator
the pleaſing Sentiment of Approbation;</hi> and Vice the
contrary. We then proceed to examine a plain
Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> what Actions have this Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
We conſider all the Circumſtances, in which
theſe Actions agree: And from thence endeavour to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0352600600:204"/>
extract ſome general Obſervations with regard to
theſe Sentiments. If you call this Metaphyſics, and
find any thing abſtruſe here, you need only conclude,
that your Turn of Mind is not ſuited to the moral
Sciences.</p>
            <p>II. WHEN a Man, at any Time, deliberates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his own Conduct, (as, whether he had
better, in a particular Emergence, aſſiſt a Brother or
a Benefactor) he muſt conſider theſe ſeparate Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with the whole Circumſtances and Situation
of the Perſons, in order to determine his ſuperior
Duty and Obligation: And in order to determine
the Proportion of Lines in any Triangle, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to examine the Nature of that Figure, and
the Relations, which its ſeveral Parts bear to each
other. But notwithſtanding this apparent Similarity
in the two Caſes, there is, at the bottom, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Difference betwixt them. A ſpeculative
Reaſoner concerning Triangles or Circles conſiders
the ſeveral known and given Relations of the Parts
of theſe Figures; and from thence infers ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Relation, which is dependent on the former.
But in moral Deliberations, we muſt be acquainted,
before-hand, with all the Objects, and all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to each other; and from a Compariſon of
the whole, fix our Choice or Approbation. No new
Fact to be aſcertain'd: No new Relation to be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0352600600:205"/>
diſcover'd. The whole Circumſtances of the Caſe
are ſuppos'd to be laid before us, 'ere we can fix any
Sentence of Blame or Approbation. If any material
Circumſtance by yet unknown or doubtful, we muſt
firſt employ our Enquiry or intellectual Faculties to
aſſure us of it; and ſuſpend for a Time all moral
Deciſion or Sentiment. While we are ignorant,
whether a Man was Aggreſſor or not, how can we
determine, whether the perſon, who kill'd him, be
criminal or innocent? But after every Circumſtance,
every Relation is known, the Underſtanding has no
farther Room to operate, nor any Object, on which
it could employ itſelf. The Approbation or Blame,
which then enſues, cannot be the Work of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but of the Heart, and is not a ſpeculative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
or Affirmation, but an active Feeling or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent.
In the Diſquiſitions of the Underſtanding,
from known Circumſtances and Relations, we infer
ſome new and unknown. In moral Deciſions, the
whole Circumſtances and Relations muſt be ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
known; and the Mind, from the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the Whole, feels ſome new Impreſſion of
Affection of Diſguſt, Eſteem or Contempt, Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
or Blame.</p>
            <p>HENCE the great Difference betwixt a Miſtake of
<hi>Fact</hi> and one of <hi>Right;</hi> and hence the Reaſon, why
the one is commonly criminal and not the other.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0352600600:206"/>
When <hi>OEdipus</hi> kill'd <hi>Laius,</hi> he was ignorant of the
Relation, and from Circumſtances, innocent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary,
form'd erroneous Opinions concerning
the Action he committed. But when <hi>Nero</hi> kill'd
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> all the Relations betwixt himſelf and the
perſon, and all the Circumſtances of the Fact were
antecedently known to him: But the Motive of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
or Fear or Intereſt, in his ſavage Heart, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
over the Sentiments of Duty and Humanity.
And when we expreſs a Deteſtation againſt him, to
which he, himſelf, in a little Time, became inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
'tis not, that we ſee any Relations, of which
he was ignorant, but that, from the Rectitude of
our Diſpoſition, we feel Sentiments, againſt which
he was harden'd, from Flattery and a long Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the moſt enormous Crimes. In theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
then, not in a Diſcovery of Relations of
any Kind, do all moral Determinations conſiſt.
Before we can pretend to form any Deciſion of this
kind, every Thing muſt be known and aſcertain'd
on the Side of the Object or Action. Nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but to feel, on our Part, ſome Sentiment of
Blame or Approbation, whence we pronounce the
Action criminal or virtuous.</p>
            <p>III. THIS Doctrine will become ſtill more evident,
if we compare moral Beauty with natural, to which,
in many Particulars, it bears ſo near a Reſemblance.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0352600600:207"/>
'Tis on the Proportion, Relation, and Poſition of
Parts, that all natural Beauty depends; but 'twould
be abſurd thence to infer, that the Perception of
Beauty, like that of Truth in geometrical Problems,
conſiſts altogether in the Perception of Relations,
and was perform'd entirely by the Underſtanding or
intellectual Faculties. In all the Sciences, our
Mind, from the known Relations, inveſtigates the
unknown: But in all Deciſions of Taſte or external
Beauty, the whole Relations are before-hand obvious
to the Eye, and we thence proceed to feel a Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Complacency or Diſguſt, according to the
Nature of the Object, and Diſpoſition of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>

               <hi>EUCLID</hi> has fully explain'd all the Qualities
of the Circle; but has not, in any Propoſition, ſaid
a Word of its Beauty. The Reaſon is evident. The
Beauty is not a Quality of the Circle. It lies not in
any Part of the Line, whoſe Parts are all equally
diſtant from a common Center. It is only the Effect,
which that Figure operates upon the Mind, whoſe
peculiar Fabric or Structure renders it ſuſceptible of
ſuch Sentiments. In vain, would you look for it in
the Circle, or ſeek it, either by your Senſes or by
mathematical Reaſonings, in all the Properties of
that Figure.</p>
            <p>

ATTEND to <hi>Palladio</hi> and <hi>Perrault,</hi> while they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
all the Parts and Proportions of a Pillar: They
talk of the Cornice and Freeze and Baſe and Enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blature
and Shaft and Architrave; and give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
and Poſition of each of theſe Members.
But ſhould you aſk the Deſcription and Poſition of
its Beauty, they would readily reply, that the Beauty
is not any of the Parts or Members of a Pillar, but
reſults from the Whole, when that complicated Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
is preſented to an intelligent Mind, ſuſceptible
of thoſe finer Senſations. Till ſuch a Spectator ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
there is nothing but a Figure of ſuch particular
Dimenſions and Proportions: From his Sentiments
alone ariſes its Elegance and Beauty.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; attend to <hi>Cicero,</hi> while he paints the
Crimes of a <hi>Verres</hi> or a <hi>Catiline;</hi> you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the moral Turpitude reſults, in the ſame
Manner, from the Contemplation of the Whole,
when preſented to a Being, whoſe Organs have ſuch
a particular Structure and Formation. The Orator
may paint Rage, Inſolence, Barbarity on the one
Side: Meekneſs, Sufferance, Sorrow, Innocence on
the other: But if you feel no Indignation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
ariſe in you from this Complication of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
you would in vain aſk him, wherein
conſiſt, the Crime or Villainy, which he ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0352600600:209"/>
exclaims againſt: At what Time, or on what
Subject it firſt began to exiſt: And what has a few
Months afterwards become of it, when every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and Thought of all the Actors is totally
alter'd or annihilated. No ſatisfactory Anſwer can
be given to any of theſe Queſtions, upon the abſtract
Hypotheſis of Morals; and we muſt at laſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the Crime or Immorality is no particular
Fact or Relation, which can be the Object of the
Underſtanding: But ariſes altogether from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of Diſapprobation, which, by the Structure
of human Nature, we unavoidably feel on the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of Barbarity or Treachery.</p>
            <p>IV. INANIMATE Objects may bear to each other
all the ſame Relations, which we obſerve in moral
Agents; tho' the former can never be the Object of
Love or Hatred, nor are conſequently ſuſceptible of
Merit or Iniquity. A young Tree, that over-tops
or deſtroys its Parent, from whoſe Seed it ſprung,
ſtands in all the ſame Relations with <hi>Nero,</hi> when he
murder'd <hi>Agrippina;</hi> and if Morality conſiſted in any
abſtract Relations, would, no doubt, be equally
criminal.</p>
            <p>V. IT appears evident, that the ultimate Ends of
human Actions can never, in any Caſe, be accounted
for by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but recommend themſelves entirely to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0352600600:210"/>
the Sentiments and Affections of Mankind, without
any Dependance on the intellectual Faculties. Aſk
a Man, <hi>why he uſes Exerciſe;</hi> he will anſwer, <hi>becauſe
he deſires to keep his Health.</hi> If you then enquire, <hi>why
he deſires Health,</hi> he will readily reply, <hi>becauſe Sickneſs
is painful.</hi> If you puſh your Enquiries farther, and
deſire a Reaſon, <hi>why he hates Pain,</hi> 'tis impoſſible he
can ever give any. This is an ultimate End, and is
never refer'd to any other Object.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS, to your ſecond Queſtion, <hi>why he deſires
Health,</hi> he may alſo reply, that <hi>'tis requiſite for the
Exerciſe of his Calling.</hi> If you aſk, <hi>why he is anxious
on that head,</hi> he will anſwer, <hi>becauſe he deſires to get
Money.</hi> If you demand, <hi>Why? It is the Inſtrument
of Pleaſure,</hi> ſays he. And beyond this, 'tis an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
to aſk for a Reaſon. 'Tis impoſſible there
can be a Progreſs <hi>in infinitum;</hi> and that one Thing
can always be the Reaſon, why another is deſir'd.
Something muſt be deſirable on its own Account, and
becauſe of its immediate Accord or Agreement with
human Sentiment and Affection.</p>
            <p>NOW as Virtue is an End, and is deſirable on its
own Account, without Fee or Reward, merely for
the immediate Satisfaction it conveys; 'tis requiſite
there ſhould be ſome Sentiment, which it touches;
ſome internal Taſte or Feeling, or whatever you
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0352600600:211"/>
pleaſe to call it, which diſtinguiſhes moral Good and
Evil, and which embraces the one and rejects the
other.</p>
            <p>THUS the diſtinct Boundaries and Offices of <hi>Reaſon</hi>
and <hi>Taſte</hi> are eaſily aſcertain'd. The former conveys
the Knowledge of Truth and Falſhood: The latter
gives the Sentiment of Beauty and Deformity,
Vice and Virtue. The one diſcovers Objects, as
they really ſtand in Nature, without Addition or
Diminution: The other has a productive Faculty,
and guilding or ſtaining all natural Objects with the
Colours, borrow'd from internal Sentiment, raiſes
in a Manner, a new Creation. Reaſon, being cool
and diſengag'd, is no Motive to Action, and directs
only the Impulſe, receiv'd from Appetite or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by ſhowing us the Means of obtaining Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or avoiding Miſery: Taſte, as it gives Pleaſure
or Pain, and thereby conſtitutes Happineſs or Miſery,
becomes a Motive to Action, and is the firſt Spring
or Impulſe to Deſire and Volition. From Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and Relations, known or ſuppos'd, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
leads us to the Diſcovery of the conceal'd and
unknown: After all Circumſtances and Relations
are laid before us, the latter makes us feel from the
Whole a new Sentiment of Blame or Approbation.
The Standard of the one, being founded on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Things, is eternal and inflexible, even by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0352600600:212"/>
the Will of the Supreme Being: The Standard of the
other, ariſing from the internal Frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Animals, is ultimately deriv'd from that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Will, who beſtow'd on each being its peculiar
Nature, and arrang'd the ſeveral Claſſes and Orders
of Exiſtence.</p>

            <p>THE Intention of this Appendix is to give
ſome more particular Explication of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and Nature of Juſtice, and mark ſome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betwixt it and the other Virtues.</p>
            <p>THE ſocial Virtues of Humanity and Benevolence
exert their Influence immediately, by a direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
or Inſtinct, which keeps chiefly in View the
ſimple Object, that moves the Affections, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
not any Scheme or Syſtem, nor the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
reſulting from the Concurrence, Imitation,
or Example of others. A Parent flies to the Relief
of his Child; tranſported by that natural Sympathy,
which actuates him, and which affords no Leiſure
to reflect on the Sentiments or Conduct of the reſt
of Mankind in like Circumſtances. A generous
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0352600600:214"/>
Man embraces cheerfully an Opportunity of ſerving
his Friend; becauſe he then feels himſelf under the
Dominion of the beneficent Affections, nor is he
concern'd whether any other Perſon in the Univerſe
was ever before actuated by ſuch noble Motives, or
will ever afterwards prove their Influence. In all
theſe Caſes, the ſocial Paſſions have in View a ſingle
individual Object, and purſue alone the Safety or
Happineſs of the Perſon, lov'd and eſteem'd. With
this, they are ſatisfy'd: In this, they acquieſce.
And as the Good reſulting from their benign Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is in itſelf compleat and entire, it alſo excites
the moral Sentiment of Approbation, without any
Reflection on farther Conſequences, or more enlarg'd
Views of the Concurrence or Imitation of the other
Members of Society. On the contrary, were the
generous Friend or diſintereſted Patriot to ſtand alone
in the Practice of Beneficence; this would rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
his Value in our Eyes, and join the Praiſe of
Rarity and Novelty to his other more exalted
Merits.</p>
            <p>THE Caſe is not the ſame with the ſocial Virtues
of Juſtice and Fidelity. They are highly uſeful, or
indeed abſolutely neceſſary to the Well-being of
Mankind: But the Benefit, reſulting from them, is
not the Conſequence of every individual ſingle Act;
but ariſes from the whole Scheme or Syſtem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0352600600:215"/>
in by the whole, or the greateſt Part of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
General Peace and Order is the Attendant
of Juſtice or a general Abſtinence from the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of others: But a particular Regard to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Right of one individual Citizen may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
conſider'd in itſelf, be attended with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Conſequences. The Reſult of the ſeveral
Acts is here often directly oppoſite to that of the
whole Syſtem of Actions; and the former may be
extremely hurtful, while the latter is, to the higheſt
Degree, advantageous. Riches, inherited from a
Parent, are, in a bad Man's Hand, the Inſtruments
of Miſchief. The Right of Succeſſion may, in one
Inſtance, be hurtful. Its Benefit ariſes only from
the Obſervance of the general Rule; and 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
if Compenſation be thereby made for all the
Ills and Inconveniencies, which flow from particular
Characters and Situations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CYRUS,</hi> young and unexperienc'd, conſider'd
only the individual Caſe before him, and reflected
on its limited Fitneſs and Convenience, when he
aſſign'd the long Coat to the tall Boy, and the ſhort
Coat to the other of ſmaller Size. His Governor
inſtructed him better; while he pointed out more
enlarg'd Views and Conſequences, and inform'd his
Pupil of the general, inflexible Rules, requiſite to
ſupport general Peace and Order in Society.</p>

THE Happineſs and Proſperity of Mankind,
ariſing from the ſocial Virtue of Benevolence and its
Subdiviſions, may be compar'd to a Wall, built by
many Hands; which ſtill riſes by each Stone, that
is heap'd upon it, and receives proportional Encreaſe
to the Diligence and Care of each Workman. The
ſame Happineſs, rais'd by the ſocial Virtue of Juſtice
and its Subdiviſions, may be compar'd to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Vault, where each individual Stone would,
of itſelf, fall to the Ground; nor does the whole
Fabric ſupport itſelf, but by the mutual Aſſiſtance and
Combination of its correſpondent Parts.</p>
            <p>ALL the Laws of Nature, which regulate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
as well as all civil Laws, are general, and
regard alone ſome eſſential Circumſtances of the
Caſe, without taking into Conſideration the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
Situations and Connexions of the Perſons
concern'd, or any particular Conſequences, that may
reſult from the Determination of theſe Laws, in
every particular Caſe, that offers. They deprive,
without Scruple, a beneficent Man of all his Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
if acquir'd by Miſtake, without a good Title;
in order to beſtow them on a ſelfiſh Miſer, who has
already heap'd up immenſe Stores of ſuperfluous
Riches Public Utility requires, that Property ſhould
be regulated by general inflexible Rules; and tho'
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0352600600:217"/>
ſuch Rules are adopted as beſt ſerve the ſame End of
public Utility, 'tis impoſſible for them to prevent
all particular Hardſhips, or make beneficial Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
reſult from every individual Caſe. 'Tis
ſufficient, if the whole Plan or Scheme be neceſſary
to the Support of civil Society, and if the Ballance
of Good, in the main, does thereby preponderate
much above that of Evil. Even the general Laws
of the Univerſe, tho' plann'd by infinite Wiſdom,
cannot exclude all Evil or Inconvenience, in every
particular Operation.</p>
            <p>IT has been aſſerted by ſome, that all Juſtice ariſes
from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the voluntary Choice, Conſent, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of Mankind. If by <hi>Convention</hi> be here
meant a <hi>Promiſe</hi> (which is the moſt uſual Senſe of
the Word) nothing can be more abſurd, than this
Poſition. The Obſervance of Promiſes is itſelf one
of the moſt conſiderable Parts of Juſtice; and we
are not ſurely bound to keep our Word, becauſe we
have given our Word to keep it. But if by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
be meant a Senſe of common Intereſt;
which Senſe each Man feels in his own Breaſt, which
he obſerves in his Fellows, and which carries him,
in concurrence with others, into a general Plan or
Syſtem of Actions, that tend to public Utility; it
muſt be own'd, that, in this Senſe, Juſtice ariſes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0352600600:218"/>
from human Conventions. For if it be allow'd
(what is, indeed, evident) that the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of a particular Act of Juſtice may be
hurtful to the Public as well as to Individuals; it
follows, that every Man, in embracing that Virtue,
muſt have an Eye to the whole Plan or Syſtem, and
muſt expect the Concurrence of his Fellows in the
ſame Conduct and Behaviour. Were all his Views
to terminate in the particular Conſequences of each
particular Act of his own, his Benevolence and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
as well as Self-love, might often preſcribe
to him Meaſures of Conduct very different from
thoſe, which are agreeable to the ſtrict Rules of
Right and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>THUS two Men pull the Oars of a Boat, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Convention, for common Intereſt, without any
Promiſe or Contract: Thus Gold and Silver are
made the Meaſures of Exchange; thus Speech and
Words and Language are fixt, by human Convention
and Agreement. Whatever is advantageous to two
or more Perſons, if all perform their Part; but what
loſes all Advantage, if only one perform, can ariſe
from no other Principle. There would otherwiſe be
no Motive for any one of them to enter into that
Scheme of Conduct<note n="*" place="bottom">This Theory concerning the Origin of Property, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Juſtice is, in the main, the ſame with that hinted at and adopted by <hi>Grotius.

THE Word, <hi>natural,</hi> is commonly taken in ſo
many Senſes, and is of ſuch looſe Signification, that
it ſeems to little Purpoſe to diſpute, whether Juſtice
be natural or not. If Self-love, if Benevolence be
natural to Man; if Reaſon and Forethought be alſo
natural; then may the ſame Epithet be apply'd to
Juſtice, Order, Fidelity, Property, Society. Men's
Inclination, their Neceſſities lead them to combine;
their Underſtanding and Experience tell them, that
this Combination is impoſſible, where each governs
himſelf by no Rule, and pays no Regard to the
Poſſeſſions of others: And from theſe Paſſions
and Reflections conjoin'd, as ſoon as we obſerve
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0352600600:220"/>
like Paſſions and Reflections in others, the Sentiment
of Juſtice, thro' all Ages, has infallibly and certainly
had place, to ſome Degree or other, in every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
of human Species. In ſo ſagacious an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
what neceſſarily ariſes from the Exertion of his
intellectual Faculties, may juſtly be eſteem'd na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural<note n="*" place="bottom">Natural may be oppos'd, either to what is <hi>unuſual, miraculous, or artificial.</hi> In the two former Senſes, Juſtice and Property are undoubtedly natural. But as they ſuppoſe Reaſon, Forethought, Deſign, and a ſocial Union and Confederacy amongſt Men, perhaps, that Epithet cannot ſtrictly, in the laſt Senſe, be apply'd to them. Had Men liv'd without Society, Property had never been known, and neither Juſtice nor Injuſtice had ever exiſted. But Society amongſt human Creatures, had been impoſſible, without Reaſon and Forethought. Inferior Animals, that unite, are guided by Inſtinct, which ſupplies the Place of Reaſon. But all theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s are merely verbal.</note>.</p>
            <p>AMONGST all civiliz'd Nations, it has been the
conſtant Endeavour to remove every Thing arbitrary
and partial from the Deciſion of Property, and to
fix the Sentence of Judges by ſuch general Views
and Conſiderations, as may be equal to every
Member of the Society. For beſides, that nothing
could be more dangerous than to accuſtom the
Bench, even in the ſmalleſt Inſtance, to regard pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Friendſhip or Enmity; 'tis certain, that Men,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0352600600:221"/>
where they imagine, that there was no other Reaſon
for the Preference of their Adverſary but perſonal
Favour, are apt to entertain the ſtrongeſt Jealouſy
and Ill-will againſt the Magiſtrates and Judges.
When natural Reaſon, therefore, points out no fixt
View of public Utility, by which a Controverſy of
Property can be decided, poſitive Laws are often
fram'd to ſupply its Place, and direct the Procedure
of all Courts of Judicature. Where theſe too fail,
as often happens, Precedents are call'd for; and a
former Deciſion, tho' given itſelf without any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Reaſon, juſtly becomes a ſufficient Reaſon for a
new Deciſion. If direct Laws and Precedents be
wanting, imperfect and indirect ones are brought in
Aid; and the controverted Caſe is rang'd under them,
by analogical Reaſonings, and Compariſons, and
Similitudes, and Correſpondencies, that are often
more fanciful than real. In general, it may ſafely
be aſſerted, that Juriſprudence is, in this reſpect,
different from all the Sciences; and in many of its
nicer Queſtions, there cannot properly be ſaid to be
Truth or Falſhood on either Side. If one Pleader
brings the Caſe under any former Law or Precedent,
by a refin'd Analogy or Compariſon; the oppoſite
Pleader is not at a Loſs to find an oppoſite Analogy or
Compariſon: And the Preference given by the Judge
is often founded more on Taſte and Imagination.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0352600600:222"/>
than on any ſolid Argument. Public Utility is the
general View of all Courts of Judicature; and this
Utility too requires a ſtable Rule in all Controverſies:
But where ſeveral Rules, nearly equal and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
preſent themſelves, 'tis a very ſlight Turn of
Thought, which fixes the Deciſion in favour of either
Party.</p>

DIALOGUE.</head>
            <p>MY Friend, <hi>Palamedes,</hi> who is as great a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
in his Principles as in his Perſon, and
who has run over, by Study and Travel, almoſt
every Region of the intellectual and material World,
ſurpriz'd me lately with an Account of a Nation,
with whom, he told me, he had paſs'd a conſiderable
Part of his Life, and whom he found, in the main,
an extreme civiliz'd, intelligent People.</p>
            <p>THERE is a State, ſay'd he, in the World, call'd
<hi>Fourli,</hi> no matter for its Longitude or Latitude,
whoſe Ways of thinking in many Things, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in Morals, are diametrically oppoſite to ours.
When I came amongſt them, I found I muſt ſubmit
to double Pains; firſt to learn the Meaning of the
Terms in their Language, and then to know the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of thoſe Terms, and the Praiſe or Blame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
to them. After a Word had been explain'd
to me, and the Character, which it expreſt, had
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0352600600:224"/>
been deſcrib'd, I concluded, that ſuch an Epithet
muſt neceſſarily be the greateſt Reproach in the
World; and was extremely ſurpriz'd to find one, in
a public Company, apply it to a Perſon, with whom
he liv'd in the ſtricteſt Intimacy and Friendſhip.
<hi>You fancy,</hi> ſaid I, one Day, to an Acquaintance,
<hi>that</hi> Changuis <hi>is your mortal Enemy: I love to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
Quarrels; and I muſt, therefore, tell you, that
Heard him talk of you in the moſt advantageous Manner.</hi>
But to my great Aſtoniſhment, when I repeated
<hi>Changuis</hi>'s Words, tho' I had both remember'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
them perfectly, I found, that they were
taken for the moſt mortal Affront, and that I had
very innocently render'd the Breach betwixt theſe
Perſons altogether irreparable.</p>
            <p>As it was my Fortune to come amongſt this People
on a very advantageous Footing, I was immediately
introduc'd to the beſt Company; and being deſir'd
to live with <hi>Alcheic,</hi> I readily accepted his Invitation,
as I found him univerſally eſteem'd for his perſonal
Merit; and indeed regarded by every one in <hi>Fourli,</hi>
as a perfect Character.</p>
            <p>ONE Evening he invited me, as an Amuſement,
to bear him Company in a Serenade, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give <hi>Gulki,</hi> with whom, he told me, he
was extremely enamour'd; and I foon found his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0352600600:225"/>
Taſte was not ſingular: For we met many of his
Rivals, who had come on the ſame Errand. I very
naturally concluded, that this Flame of his muſt be
one of the fineſt Women in Town; and I already
felt a ſecret Inclination to ſee her, and be acquainted
with her. But as the Moon began to riſe, I was
much ſurpriz'd to find, that we were in the Midſt of
the Univerſity, where <hi>Gulki</hi> ſtudy'd: And I was
ſomewhat aſham'd for having attended my Friend,
on ſuch an Errand.</p>
            <p>I WAS told afterwards, that <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Choice of
<hi>Gulki</hi> was very much approv'd of by all the good
Company in Town; and that 'twas expected, while
he gratify'd his own Paſſion, he would perform to
that young Man the ſame good Office, which he had
himſelf ow'd to <hi>Elcouf.</hi> It ſeems <hi>Alcheic</hi> had been
very handſome in his Youth, and been courted by
many Lovers; but had beſtow'd his Favours chiefly
on the ſage <hi>Elcouf;</hi> to whom he was ſuppos'd to owe,
in a great Meaſure, the aſtoniſhing Progreſs he had
made in Philoſophy and Virtue.</p>
            <p>IT gave me ſome Surprize, that <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Wife
(who by-the-bye happen'd alſo to be his Siſter) was
no way ſcandaliz'd at this Species of Infidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0352600600:226"/>
MUCH about the ſame Time I diſcover'd (for it
was not attempted to be kept a Secret from me or
any Body) that <hi>Alcheic</hi> was a Murderer and a Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
and had put to Death an innocent Perſon, the
moſt nearly connected with him, and whom he was
oblig'd to protect and defend by all the Ties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Humanity. When I aſk'd, with all the
Caution and Deference imaginable, what was his
Motive for this Action; he reply'd coolly, that he
was not then ſo much at his Eaſe as he is at preſent,
and that he had acted, in that Particular, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of all his Friends.</p>
            <p>HAVING heard <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Virtue ſo extremely cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
I pretended to join in the general Voice of
Acclamation, and only aſk'd, by way of Curioſity,
as a Stranger, which of all his noble Actions was
moſt highly applauded; and I ſoon found, that all
Sentiments were united in giving the Preference to
the Aſſaſſination of <hi>Usbek.</hi> This <hi>Usbek</hi> had been to
the laſt Moment <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s intimate Friend, had lay'd
many high Obligations upon him, had even ſav'd
his Life on a certain Occaſion, and had, by his Will,
which was found after the Murder, made him his
Heir to a conſiderable Part of his Fortune. <hi>Alcheic,</hi>
it ſeems, conſpir'd with about twenty or thirty more,
moſt of them alſo <hi>Usbek</hi>'s Friends; and falling all
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0352600600:227"/>
together on that unhappy Man, when he was not
aware, they had tore him with a hundred Wounds;
and given him that Reward for all his paſt Favours
and Obligations. <hi>Usbek,</hi> ſaid the general Voice of
the People, had many great and good Qualities:
His very Vices were ſhining, magnificent, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous:
But this Action of <hi>Alcheic</hi> ſets him far above
<hi>Usbek</hi> in the Eyes of all Judges of Merit; and is
one of the nobleſt, that ever perhaps the Sun ſhone
upon.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Part of <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Conduct, which I alſo
found highly applauded, was his Behaviour towards
<hi>Caliſh,</hi> with whom he was join'd in a Project or
Undertaking of ſome Importance. <hi>Caliſh,</hi> being a
paſſionate Man, gave <hi>Alcheic,</hi> one Day, a ſound
Drubbing; which he took very patiently, waited
the Return of <hi>Caliſh</hi>'s good Humour, kept ſtill a fair
Correſpondence with him; and by that Means
brought the Affair, in which they were join'd, to a
happy Iſſue, and gain'd himſelf immortal Honour
by his remarkable Temper and Moderation.</p>
            <p>I HAVE lately receiv'd a Letter from a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in <hi>Fourli,</hi> by which I learn, that ſince my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<hi>Alcheic,</hi> falling into a bad State of Health,
has fairly hang'd himſelf; and has dy'd univerſally
regreted and applauded by every one in that Country.
So virtuous and noble a Life, ſays each <hi>Fourlian,</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0352600600:228"/>
could not be better crown'd than by ſo noble an
End; and he has prov'd by this, as well as by all
his other Actions, what was his conſtant Principle
during his Life, and what he boaſted of near his laſt
Moments, that a wiſe Man is ſcarce inferior to the
great God, <hi>Vitzli.</hi> This is the Name of the Supreme
Deity amongſt the <hi>Fourlians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Notions of this People, continu'd <hi>Palamedes,</hi>
are as extraordinary with regard to Good-manners
and Sociableneſs, as with regard to Morals. My
Friend <hi>Alcheic</hi> form'd once a Party for my Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
compos'd of all the prime Wits and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of <hi>Fourli;</hi> and each of us brought his Meſs
along with him to the Place, where we aſſembled.
I obſerv'd one of them to be worſe provided than
the reſt, and offer'd him a Share of mine, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to be a roaſted Pullet: And I could not but
remark, that he, and all the reſt of the Company
ſtar'd at my Simplicity. I was told, that <hi>Alcheic</hi> had
once ſo much Intereſt with his Club as to prevail
with them to eat in common, and that he had made
uſe of an Artifice to that Purpoſe. He perſuaded
thoſe, whom he obſerv'd to be <hi>worſt</hi> provided, to
offer their Meſs to the Company; after which, the
others, who had brought more delicate Fare, were
aſham'd not to make the ſame Offer. This is regarded
as ſo extraordinary a Event, that it has ſince, as I
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0352600600:229"/>
learn, been recorded in the Hiſtory of <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Life,
compos'd by one of the greateſt Geniuſes of <hi>Fourli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRAY, ſays I, <hi>Palamedes,</hi> when you was at <hi>Fourli,</hi>
did you alſo learn the Art of turning your Friends
into Ridicule, by telling them ſtrange Stories, and
then laughing at them, if they believ'd you. I aſſure
you, reply'd he, that had I been diſpos'd to learn
ſuch a Leſſon, there was no Place in the World more
proper. My Friend, ſo often mention'd, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
from Morning to Night, but ſneer, and
banter, and railly; and you could ſcarce ever diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
whether he was in Jeſt or Earneſt; But you
think, then, that my Story is improbable; and that
I have us'd, or rather abus'd the Privilege of a
Traveller. To be ſure, ſays I, you was but in Jeſt.
Such barbarous and ſavage Manners are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
with a civiliz'd, intelligent People, ſuch
as you ſaid theſe were; but are ſcarce compatible
with human Nature. They exceed all we ever read
of, amongſt the <hi>Mingrelians</hi> and <hi>Topinamboues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVE a care, cry'd he, have a care! You are
not aware you are ſpeaking Blaſphemy, and are
abuſing your Favourites, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> eſpecially the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> whom I have couch'd all along, under
theſe bizarre Names I employ'd. If you conſider
aright, there is not one Stroke of the foregoing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0352600600:230"/>
Character, which might not be fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd in the Man of
higheſt Merit at <hi>Athens,</hi> without diminiſhing, in the
leaſt, from the Brightneſs of his Character. The <hi>Greek</hi>
Love, their Marriages<note n="*" place="bottom">The Laws of <hi>Athens</hi> allow'd a Man to marry his Siſter by the Father. <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws forbid Paederaſty to Slaves, as being of too great Dignity for ſuch mean Perſons.</note>, and the expoſing of their
Children cannot but ſtrike you immediately. The
Death of <hi>Usbek</hi> is an exact Counter-part to that of
<hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL to a Trifle, ſay'd I, interrupting him; you
did not mention, that <hi>Usbek</hi> was an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>I DID not, reply'd he; leſt you ſhould diſcover the
Parallel I aim'd at. But even adding this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
we ſhould make no Scruple, according to our
Sentiments of Morals, to denomitate <hi>Brutus,</hi> and
<hi>Caſſius,</hi> ungrateful Traitors and Aſſaſſins: Tho' you
know, that they are, perhaps, the higheſt Characters
of all Antiquity; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> erected Statues
to them; which they plac'd near thoſe of <hi>Harmodius</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtogiton,</hi> their own Deliverers. And if you
think this Circumſtance, you mention, ſo material
to abſolve theſe Patriots, I ſhall compenſate it by
another, not mention'd, which will equally aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their Crime. A few Days before the Execution
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0352600600:231"/>
of their fatal Purpoſe, they all ſwore Fealty to
<hi>Caeſar;</hi> and proteſting to hold his Perſon ever ſacred,
they touch'd the Altar with thoſe Hands, which they
had already arm'd for his Deſtruction<note n="*" place="bottom">Appian. Bell. Civ. Lib. 3. Suetonius in vita Caeſaris.</note>.</p>
            <p>I NEED not put you in mind of the famous and
applauded Story of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and of his Patience
towards <hi>Eurybiades,</hi> the <hi>Spartan,</hi> his commanding
Officer, who, heated by a Debate, lifted his Cane
to him in a Council of War (the ſame Thing as if he
had cudgel'd him) <hi>Strike!</hi> Cries the <hi>Athenian, Strike!
but hear me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU are too good a Scholar not to diſcover <hi>Socrates</hi>
and his <hi>Athenian</hi> Club in my laſt Story; and you
would certainly obſerve, that it is exactly copy'd
from <hi>Xenophon,</hi> with a Variation only of the Names<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. Soc. Lib. 3. ſub fine.</note>.
And I think I have fairly made appear, that an
<hi>Athenian</hi> Man of Merit might be ſuch a one as with
us would paſs for Inceſtuous, a Parricide, an Aſſaſſin,
an ungrateful, perjur'd Traitor, and ſomething elſe
too abominable to be nam'd; not to mention his
Ruſticity and Ill-manners. And having liv'd in this
Manner, his Death may be entirely ſuitable: He
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0352600600:232"/>
may conclude the Scene by a deſperate Act of Self-murder,
and dye with the moſt abſurd Blaſphemies
in his Mouth. And notwithſtanding all this, he
ſhall have Statues, if not Altars, erected to his
Memory; Poems and Orations ſhall be compos'd in
his Praiſe; great Sects ſhall be proud of calling
themſelves by his Name; and the moſt diſtant Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſhall blindly continue their Admiration: Tho'
were ſuch a one to ariſe amongſt themſelves, they
would juſtly regard him with Horror and Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I MIGHT have been aware, reply'd I, of your
Artifice. You ſeem to take Pleaſure in this Topic;
and are indeed the only Man I ever knew, who was
well acquainted with the Antients, and did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
admire them. But inſtead of attacking their
Philoſophy, their Eloquence, or Poetry, the uſual
Subjects of Controverſy betwixt us, you now ſeem
to impeach their Morals, and accuſe them of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a Science, which is the only one, in my
Opinion, wherein they are not ſurpaſs'd by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns.
Geometry, Phyſics, Aſtronomy, Anatomy,
Botany, Geography, Navigation; in theſe we juſtly
claim the Superiority: But what have we to oppoſe
to their Moraliſts? Your Repreſentation of Things
is fallacious. You have no Indulgence for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Cuſtoms of different Ages. Would you try
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0352600600:233"/>
a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> by the Common-law of <hi>England?</hi>
Hear him defend himſelf by his own Maxims; and
then pronounce.</p>
            <p>THERE are no Manners ſo innocent or reaſonable,
which may not be render'd odious or ridiculous, if
meaſur'd by a Standard, unknown to the Perſons;
eſpecially, if you employ a little Art or Eloquence,
in aggravating ſome Circumſtances, and extenuating
others, as beſt ſerves the Purpoſe of your Diſcourſe.
All theſe Artifices may eaſily be retorted on you.
Could I inform the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for Inſtance, there was
a Nation, wherein Adultery, both active and paſſive,
ſo to ſpeak, was in the higheſt Vogue and Eſteem:
Wherein every Man of Education choſe for his
Miſtreſs a marry'd Woman, the Wife, perhaps, of
his Friend and Companion; and valu'd himſelf upon
theſe infamous Conqueſts, as much as if he had been
ſeveral Times a Conqueror in Boxing or Wreſtling
at the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games. Wherein every Man, alſo,
took a Pride in his Tameneſs and Facility with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his own Wife, and was glad to make Friends
or gain Intereſt by allowing her to proſtitute her
Charms; and even, without any ſuch Motive, gave
her full Liberty and Indulgence. I aſk, what Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
the <hi>Athenians</hi> would entertain of ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
they who never mention'd the Crime of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
but in Conjunction with Robbery and Poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0352600600:234"/>
Which would they admire moſt, the Villainy
or the Meanneſs of ſuch a Conduct?</p>
            <p>SHOULD I add, that the ſame People were as proud
of their Slavery and Dependance as the <hi>Athenians</hi>
were of their Liberty; and tho' a Man among them
were oppreſt, diſgrac'd, impoveriſh'd, inſulted, or
impriſon'd by the Tyrant, he would ſtill regard it as
the higheſt Merit to love, ſerve, and obey him;
and even to die for his ſmalleſt Glory or Satisfaction:
Theſe noble <hi>Greeks</hi> would probably aſk me, whether
I ſpoke of a human Society, or of ſome inferior,
ſervile Species.</p>
            <p>'TWAS then I might inform my <hi>Athenian</hi> Audience,
that theſe People, however, wanted not Spirit and
Bravery. If a Man, ſays I, tho' their intimate
Friend, ſhould throw out, in a private Company, a
Raillery againſt them, nearly approaching any of
thoſe, with which your Generals and Demagogues
every Day regale each other, in the Face of the
whole City, they never can forgive him; but in
order to revenge themſelves, they oblige him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to run them thro' the Body, or be himſelf
murder'd. And if a Man, who is an abſolute
Stranger to them, ſhould deſire them, at the Peril
of their own Life, to cut the Throat of their Boſom-companion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they immediately obey, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0352600600:235"/>
highly oblig'd and honour'd by the Commiſſion.
Theſe are their Maxims of Honour: This is their
favourite Morality.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' ſo ready to draw their Sword againſt
their Friends and Countrymen; no Diſgrace, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
no Pain, no Poverty will ever engage theſe
People to turn the Point of it againſt their own
Breaſt. A Man of Rank would row in the Gallies,
would beg his Bread, would languiſh in Priſon,
would ſuffer any Tortures; and ſtill preſerve his
wretched Life. Rather than eſcape his Enemies by
a generous Contempt of Death, he would infamouſly
receive the ſame Death from his Enemies, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by their triumphant Inſults, and by the moſt
exquiſite Sufferings.</p>
            <p>'TIS very uſual too, continu'd I, amongſt this
People to ſhut up ſeveral of their Children in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Priſon (where every Art of plaguing, and
tormenting them is carefully ſtudy'd and practis'd)
in order, that another Child, whom they own to
have no greater or rather leſs Merit than the reſt,
may enjoy their whole Fortune, and wallow in every
Kind of Voluptuouſneſs and Pleaſure. Nothing ſo
virtuous in their Opinion as this barbarous Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0352600600:236"/>
BUT what is more particular in this whimſical
Nation, ſay I to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> is, that a Frolic of
yours during the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Greeks</hi> kept the Feaſt of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Chronus,</hi> as well as the <hi>Romans.</hi> See Lucian. Epiſt. Saturn.</note>, when the Slaves
are ſerv'd by their Maſters, is ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
by them thro' the whole Year, and thro' the
whole Courſe of their Lives; and accompany'd too
with ſome Circumſtances, which ſtill farther augment
the Abſurdity and Ridicule. Your Sport only elevates
for a few Days thoſe whom Fortune has thrown
down, and whom ſhe too, in Sport, may really ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
for ever above you: But this Nation gravely
exalt thoſe, whom Nature has ſubjected to them,
and whoſe Inferiority and Infirmities are abſolutely
incurable. The Women, tho' without Virtue, are
their Maſters and Sovereigns: Theſe they reverence,
praiſe, and magnify: To theſe, they pay the higheſt
Deference and Reſpect: And in all Places and at all
Times, the Superiority of the Females is readily
acknowledg'd and ſubmitted to by every one, who
has the leaſt Pretenſions to Education and Politeneſs.
Scarce any Crime would be ſo univerſally deteſted
as an Infraction of this Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0352600600:237"/>
YOU need go no farther, reply'd <hi>Palamedes,</hi> I can
eaſily conjecture the People you aim at. The Strokes,
with which you have painted them, are pretty juſt;
and yet you muſt acknowledge, that ſcarce any
People are to be found, either in antient or modern
Times, whoſe national Character is, upon the Whole,
leſs liable to Exceptions. But I give you Thanks for
helping me our with my Argument. I had no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of exalting the Moderns at the Expence of
the Antients. I only meant to repreſent the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of all theſe Judgments concerning Characters;
and to convince you, that Faſhion, Vogue, Cuſtom,
and Law were the chief Foundation of all moral
Determinations. The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſurely, were a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,
intelligent People, if ever there was one;
and yet their Man of Merit might, in this Age,
be held in Horror and Execration. The <hi>French</hi> are
alſo, without doubt, a very civiliz'd, intelligent
People; and yet their Man of Merit might, with
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> be an Object of the higheſt Contempt
and Ridicule, and even Hatred. And what renders
the Matter more extraordinary: Theſe two national
Characters are ſuppos'd to be the moſt ſimilar of any
in antient or modern Times; and while the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
flatter themſelves that they reſemble the <hi>Romans,</hi>
their Neighbours on the Continent draw the Parallel
betwixt themſelves and theſe polite <hi>Greeks.</hi> What
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0352600600:238"/>
wide Difference, therefore, in the Sentiments of
Morals, muſt be found betwixt civiliz'd Nations and
Barbarians, or betwixt Nations whoſe Characters
have little in common? How ſhall we pretend to
fix a Standard for Judgments of this Nature?</p>
            <p>BY tracing Matters, reply'd I, a little higher, and
examining the firſt Principles, which each Nation
eſtabliſhes, of Blame or Cenſure. The <hi>Rhine</hi> flows
North, the <hi>Rhone</hi> South; yet both ſpring from the
<hi>ſame</hi> Mountain, and are alſo actuated, in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Directions, by the <hi>ſame</hi> Principle of Gravity:
The different Inclinations of the Ground, on which
they run, cauſe all the Difference of their Courſes.</p>
            <p>IN how many Circumſtances would an <hi>Athenian</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Man of Merit certainly concur? Good-ſenſe,
Knowledge, Wit, Eloquence, Humanity,
Fidelity, Truth, Juſtice, Courage, Temperance,
Conſtancy, Dignity of Mind. Theſe you have all
omitted; in order to inſiſt only on the Points, in
which they may, by Accident, differ. Very well:
I am willing to comply with you; and ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to account for theſe Differences from the moſt
univerſal, eſtabliſh'd Principles of Morals.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Greek</hi> Loves, I care not to examine more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.
I ſhall only obſerve, that, however blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0352600600:239"/>
they aroſe from a very innocent Cauſe, the
Frequency of the Gymnaſtic Exerciſes amongſt that
People; and were recommended, tho' abſurdly, as
the Source of Friendſhip, Sympathy, mutual Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Fidelity<note n="*" place="bottom">Plat. Symp. P.182. Ex Edit. Serr.</note>; Qualities eſteem'd in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and all Ages.</p>
            <p>THE Marriage of Half-brothers and Siſters ſeems
no great Difficulty. Love betwixt the nearer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is contrary to Reaſon and public Utility; but
the preciſe Point, where we are to ſtop, can ſcarcely
be determin'd by natural Reaſon; and is therefore a
very proper Subject of municipal Law or Cuſtom.
If the <hi>Athenians</hi> went a little too far on the one Side,
the Canon Law has ſurely puſh'd Matters a great
way into the other Extremity<note n="†" place="bottom">See Enquiry. Sect. IV.</note>.</p>
            <p>HAD you aſk'd a Parent at <hi>Athens,</hi> why he bereav'd
his Child of that Life, which he had ſo lately given
it. 'Tis becauſe I love it, he would reply; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Poverty it muſt inherit from me, as a greater
Evil than a Death, which it is not capable of dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
feeling, or reſenting<note n="‡" place="bottom">Plutarch. de amore prolis, ſub fine.</note>.</p>
            <p>HOW is public Liberty, the moſt valuable of all
Bleſſings, to be recover'd from the Hands of an
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0352600600:240"/>
Uſurper or Tyrant, if his Power ſhields him from
public Rebellion, and our Scruples from private
Vengeance? That his Crime is capital by Law, you
acknowledge: And muſt the higheſt Aggravation of
his Crime, the putting himſelf above Law, form his
full Security? You can reply nothing, but by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Inconveniencies of Aſſaſſination;
which, could any one have prov'd clearly to the
Antients, he had reform'd their Sentiments in this
Particular.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, to caſt your Eye on the Picture I have
drawn of modern Manners; there is almoſt as great
Difficulty, I acknowledge, to juſtify <hi>French</hi> as <hi>Greek</hi>
Gallantry; except only, that the former is much
more natural and agreeable than the latter. But our
Neighbours, it ſeems, have reſolv'd to ſacrifice ſome
of the domeſtic to the ſociable Pleaſures; and to
prefer Eaſe, Freedom, and an open Commerce to a
ſtrict Fidelity and Conſtancy. Theſe Ends are both
good, and are ſomewhat difficult to reconcile; nor
need we be ſurpriz'd, if the Cuſtoms of Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
too much, ſometimes to the one Side, ſometimes
to the other.</p>
            <p>THE moſt inviolable Attachment to the Laws of
our Country is every-where acknowledg'd a capital
Virtue; and where the People are not ſo happy, as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0352600600:241"/>
to have any other Legiſlature but a ſingle Perſon, the
ſtricteſt Loyalty is, in that Caſe, the trueſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm.</p>
            <p>NOTHING ſurely can be more abſurd and barbarous
than the Practice of Duelling; but thoſe, who
juſtify it, ſay, that it begets Civility and Good-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
And a Dueliſt, you may obſerve, always
values himſelf upon his Courage, his Senſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
his Fidelity and Friendſhip; Qualities, which
are here indeed very oddly directed, but have been
eſteem'd univerſally, ſince the Foundation of the
World.</p>
            <p>HAVE the Gods forbid Self-murder? An <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
allows, that it ought to be foreborn. Has the
Deity permitted it? A <hi>Frenchman</hi> allows, that
Death is preferable to Pain and Infamy.</p>
            <p>YOU ſee then, continu'd I, that the Principles,
upon which Men reaſon in Morals are always the
ſame; tho' the Concluſions they draw are often very
different. That they all reaſon aright with regard to
this Subject, more than with regard to any other, it
is not incumbent on any Moraliſt to ſhow. 'Tis
ſufficient, that the original Principles of Cenſure or
Blame are uniform, and that erroneus Concluſions
can be corrected by ſounder Reaſonings and a larger
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0352600600:242"/>
Experience. As many Ages as have elaps'd ſince
the Fall of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch Changes as
have arriv'd in Religion, Language, Laws, and
Cuſtoms; none of theſe Revolutions has ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
any conſiderable Innovation in the primary
Sentiments of Morals, more than in thoſe of external
Beauty. Some minute Differences, perhaps, may
be obſerv'd in both. <hi>Horace</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. Lib. 1. Epiſt. 7. Alſo Lib. 1. Ode 3.</note> celebrates a low Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and <hi>Anacreon</hi> join'd Eye-brows<note n="†" place="bottom">Ode 28. Petronius (Cap. 86.) joins both theſe Circumſtances as Beauties.</note>: But the
<hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Venus</hi> of Antiquity are ſtill our Models
for Male and Female Beauty; in like Manner as the
Character of <hi>Scipio</hi> continues our Standard for the
Glory of Heroes, and that of <hi>Cornelia</hi> for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Matrons.</p>
            <p>IT appears, that there never was any Quality, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by any one, as a Virtue or moral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence;
but on account of its being <hi>uſeful,</hi> or
<hi>agreeable,</hi> to a Man <hi>himſelf,</hi> or to <hi>others.</hi> For what
other Reaſon can there ever be for Praiſe or Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation?
Or where would be the Senſe of extolling
<hi>good</hi> Character of Action, which, at the ſame Time,
is allow'd to be <hi>good for nothing?</hi> All the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
therefore, in Morals may be reduc'd to this
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0352600600:243"/>
one general Foundation, and may be accounted for
by the different Views, which People take of theſe
Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES Men differ in their Judgment about
the Uſefulneſs of any Habit or Action: Sometimes
alſo the peculiar Circumſtances of Things render one
moral Quality more uſeful than others, and give it a
peculiar Preference.</p>
            <p>'TIS not ſurpriſing, that, during a Period of War
and Diſorder, the military Virtues ſhould be more
celebrated than the pacific, and attract more the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and Attention of Mankind.<q rend="inline">"How uſual
is it,"</q> ſays <hi>Tully</hi>

is even the ſame Virtue of Courage amongſt

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0352600600:244"/>
obſerve, that as the Difference betwixt War and
Peace is the greateſt, that ariſes among Nations and
public Societies, it produces alſo the greateſt Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in moral Sentiment, and diverſifies the moſt our
Idea of Virtue and perſonal Merit.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES too, Magnanimity, Greatneſs of
Mind, Diſdain of Slavery, inflexible Rigour and
Integrity may ſuit better the Circumſtances of one Age
than thoſe of another, and have a more kindly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
both on public Affairs, and on a Man's own
Safety and Advancement. Our Idea of Merit,
therefore, will alſo vary a little with theſe Variations;
and <hi>Labeo,</hi> perhaps, be cenſur'd for the ſame Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which procur'd <hi>Cato</hi> the higheſt Approbation.</p>
            <p>A DEGREE of Luxury may be ruinous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in a Native of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which only foſters
the Arts, and encourages Induſtry in a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or
<hi>Engliſhman.</hi> We are not, therefore, to expect,
either the ſame Sentiment, or the ſame Laws in <hi>Berne,</hi>
that prevail in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DIFFERENT Cuſtoms have alſo ſome Influence,
as well as different Utilities; and by giving an early
Biaſs to the Mind, may produce a ſuperior Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
either to the uſeful or the agreeable Qualities; to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0352600600:245"/>
thoſe, which regard Self, or thoſe, which extend to
Society. Theſe four Sources of moral Sentiment
ſtill ſubſiſt; but particular Accidents may, at one
Time, make one of them flow with greater Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
than at another.</p>
            <p>THE Cuſtoms of ſome Nations ſhut up the Women
from all ſocial Commerce: Thoſe of others make
them ſo eſſential a Part of Society and Converſation,
that, except where Buſineſs is canvaſs'd, the Male-ſex
alone are ſuppos'd abſolutely incapable of mutual
Diſcourſe and Entertainment. As this Difference is
the moſt material, that can happen in private Life,
it muſt alſo produce the greateſt Variation in our
moral Sentiments.</p>
            <p>OF all Nations in the World, where Polygamy
was not allow'd, the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſeem to have been the
moſt reſerv'd in their Commerce with the Fair-ſex,
and to have impos'd on them the ſtricteſt Laws of
Modeſty and Decency. We have a ſtrong Inſtance
of this in an Oration of <hi>Lyſias</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orat. 33.</note>. A Widow injur'd,
ruin'd, undone, calls a Meeting of a few of her neareſt
Friends and Relations; and tho' never before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd,
ſays the Orator, to ſpeak in the Preſence
of Men, the Diſtreſs of her Circumſtances conſtrain'd
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0352600600:246"/>
her to lay the Caſe before them. Her very Opening
her Mouth in ſuch Company requir'd, it ſeems, an
Apology.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> proſecuted his Tutors, to make
them refund his Patrimony, it became neceſſary for
him, in the Courſe of the Law ſuit, to prove that
the Marriage of <hi>Aphobus</hi>'s Siſter with <hi>Oneter</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
fraudulent, and that, notwithſtanding her
Sham-marriage, ſhe had liv'd with her Brother at
<hi>Athens</hi> for two Years laſt paſt, ever ſince her Divorce
from her former Huſband. And 'tis remarkable,
that tho' theſe were People of the firſt Fortune and
Diſtinction in the City, the Orator could prove this
Fact no Way, but by calling for her female Slaves
to be put to the Queſtion, and by the Evidence of
one Phyſician, who had ſeen her in her Brother's
Houſe during her Illneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">In Oneterem.</note>. So reſerv'd were <hi>Greek</hi>
Manners.</p>
            <p>WE may be certain, that an extreme Purity was
the Conſequence of this Reſerve. Accordingly, we
find, that, except the fabulous Stories of an <hi>Helen</hi>
and a <hi>Clytemneſtra,</hi> there ſcarce is an Inſtance of any
Event in the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtory, that proceeded from the
Intrigues of Women. On the other hand, in modern
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0352600600:247"/>
Times, particularly in a neighbouring Nation, the
Females enter into all Tranſactions and all Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Church and State; and no Man can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
who takes not care to obtain their good Graces.
<hi>Harry</hi> the third, by incurring the Diſpleaſure of the
Fair, endanger'd his Crown, and loſt his Life, as
much as by his Indulgence to Hereſy.</p>
            <p>'TIS needleſs to diſſemble: The Conſequence of a
very free Commerce betwixt the Sexes, and of their
living much together, will often terminate in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
and Gallantry. We muſt ſacrifice ſomewhat
of the <hi>uſeful,</hi> if we be very anxious to obtain all the
<hi>agreeable</hi> Qualities; and cannot pretend to reach alike
every Kind of Advantage. Inſtances of Licence,
daily multiplying, will weaken the Scandal with the
one Sex, and teach the other, by Degrees, to adopt
the famous Maxim of <hi>la Fontaine,</hi> with regard to
female Infidelity, <hi>that if one knows it, it is but a ſmall
Matter; if one knows it not, it is nothing</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <l>Quand on le ſçait c'eſt peu de choſe:</l>
                  <l>Quand on ne le ſçait pas, ce n'eſt rien.</l>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>SOME People are inclin'd to think, that the beſt
Way of adjuſting all Differences, and of keeping
the proper Medium betwixt the <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi>
Qualities of the Sex is to live with them after the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0352600600:248"/>
Manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (for the
Cuſtoms of theſe two Nations ſeem ſimilar in this
Reſpect<note n="*" place="bottom">During the Time of the Emperors, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeem to have been more given to Intrigues and Gallantry than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are at preſent: And the Women of Condition, in order to retain their Lovers, endeavour'd to fix a Name of Reproach on thoſe, who were addicted to Wenching and low Amours. They were call'd <hi>Ancillarioli.</hi> See Seneca de Beneficiis. Lib. 1. Cap. 9. See alſo Martial, Lib. 12. Epig. 58.</note>) that is, without Gallantry<note n="†" place="bottom">The Gallantry here meant is that of Amours and Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not that of Complaiſance, which is as much pay'd to the fair Sex in <hi>England</hi> as in any other Country.</note> and without
Jealouſy. By a Parity of Reaſon, the Cuſtoms of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and of the <hi>Italians</hi> of an Age ago (for
the preſent are very different) muſt be the worſt of
any; becauſe they favour both Gallantry and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.</p>
            <p>NOR will theſe different Cuſtoms of Nations affect
only the one Sex: The Idea of perſonal Merit in
the Males muſt alſo be ſomewhat different, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
at leaſt, to Converſation, Addreſs, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
The one Nation, where the Men live much
apart, will naturally more eſteem Prudence; the
other, Gaiety: With the one, Simplicity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
will be in the higheſt Reſpect; with the other,
Politeneſs. The one will diſtinguiſh themſelves by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0352600600:249"/>
Good-ſenſe and Judgment; the other, by Taſte and
Delicacy: The Eloquence of the former will ſhine
moſt in the Senate; that of the other, on the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre.</p>
            <p>THESE, I ſay, are the <hi>natural</hi> Effects of ſuch
Cuſtoms. For it muſt be confeſt, that Chance has a
great Influence on national Manners; and many Events
happen in Society, which are not to be accounted
for by general Rules. Who could imagine, for
Inſtance, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who liv'd freely with their
Women, ſhould be very indifferent about Muſic,
and eſteem Dancing infamous: While the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
who never almoſt ſaw a Woman but in their own
Houſes, were continually piping, ſinging, and danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>THE Differences of moral Sentiment, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ariſe from a republican or monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
are alſo very obvious; as well as thoſe,
which proceed from general Riches or Poverty,
Union or Faction, Ignorance or Learning. I ſhall
conclude this long Diſcourſe with obſerving, that
different Cuſtoms and Situations vary the original
Ideas of Merit (however they may, ſome Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences)
in no very eſſential Point, and prevail
chiefly with regard to young Men, who can aſpire
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0352600600:250"/>
to the agreeable Qualities, and may attempt to pleaſe,
The MANNER, the ORNAMENTS, the
GRACES, that ſucceed in this Shape, are more
arbitrary and caſual: But the Merit of riper Years is
almoſt every-where the ſame; and conſiſts chiefly in
Integrity, Humanity, Ability, Knowledge and the
other more ſolid and uſeful Qualities of the human
Mind.</p>
            <p>WHAT you inſiſt on, reply'd <hi>Palamedes,</hi> may have
ſome Foundation, when you ſtick to the Maxims of
common Life and ordinary Conduct. Experience
and the Practice of the World readily correct any
great Extravagance on either Side. But what ſay
you to <hi>artificial</hi> Lives and Manners? How do you
reconcile the Maxims, on which theſe are founded?</p>
            <p>WHAT do you underſtand by <hi>artificial</hi> Lives and
Manners, ſaid I? I explain myſelf, reply'd he.
You know, that Religion had, in antient Times'
very little Influence on common Life, and that,
after Men had perform'd their Duty in Sacrifices and
Prayers at the Temple, they thought, that the Gods
left the reſt of their Conduct to themſelves, and were
little pleas'd, or offended with thoſe Virtues and
Vices, that only affected the Peace and Happineſs of
human Society. In thoſe Ages, 'twas the Buſineſs
of Philoſophy alone to regulate Men's ordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0352600600:251"/>
and Deportment; and accordingly, we may
obſerve, that this being the ſole Principle, by which
a Man could elevate himſelf above his Fellows, it
acquir'd a mighty Aſcendant over many, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
great Singularities of Maxims and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
At preſent, that Philoſophy has loſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement
of Novelty, it has no ſuch extenſive Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but ſeems to confine itſelf moſtly to Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Cloſet; in the ſame Manner, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Religion was limited to Sacrifices in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Its Place is now ſupply'd by the modern Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which inſpects our whole Conduct, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
an univerſal Rule to our Actions, to our
Words, to our very Thoughts and Inclinations; a
Rule ſo much the more auſtere, that it is guarded by
infinite, tho' diſtant. Rewards and Puniſhments;
and no Infraction of it can ever be conceal'd or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DIOGENES</hi> is the moſt celebrated Model of
extravagant Philoſophy. Let us ſeek a Parallel to
him in modern Times. We ſhall not diſgrace any
philoſophic Name by a Compariſon with the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics</hi>
or <hi>Loyolas,</hi> or any canoniz'd Monk or Friar.
Let us compare him to <hi>Paſcal,</hi> a Man of Parts and
Genius as well as <hi>Diogenes</hi> himſelf; and perhaps too,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0352600600:252"/>
a Man of Virtue, had he allow'd his virtuous Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to have exerted and diſplay'd themſelves.</p>
            <p>THE Foundation of <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s Conduct was to
render himſelf an independent Being as much as
poſſible, and to confine all his Wants and Deſires and
Pleaſures within himſelf and his own Mind: The
Aim of <hi>Paſcal</hi> was to keep a perpetual Senſe of his
Dependance before his Eyes, and never to forget his
numberleſs Wants and Neceſſities. The Antient
ſupported himſelf by Magnanimity, Oſtentation,
Pride, and the Idea of his own Superiority above
his Fellow-creatures. The Modern made conſtant
Profeſſion of Humility and Abaſement, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Hatred of himſelf; and endeavour'd to
attain theſe ſuppos'd Virtues, as far as they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.
The Auſterities of the <hi>Greek</hi> were in order
to inure himſelf to Hardſhips, and prevent his ever
ſuffering: Thoſe of the <hi>Frenchman</hi> were embrac'd
merely for their own Sake, and in order to ſuffer as
much as poſſible. The Philoſopher indulg'd himſelf in
the moſt beaſtly Pleaſures, even in public: The Saint
refus'd himſelf the moſt innocent, even in private:
The former thought it his Duty to love his Friends,
and to rail at them, and reprove them, and ſcold
them: The latter endeavour'd to be abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
towards his neareſt Relations, and to love
and ſpeak well of his Enemies. The great Object
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0352600600:253"/>
of <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s Wit was every Kind of Superſtition,
that is, every Kind of Religion known in his Time.
The Mortality of the Soul was his Standard Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and even his Sentiments of a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſeem to have been very licentious. The moſt
ridiculous Superſtitions directed <hi>Paſcal</hi>'s Faith and
Practice; and an extreme Contempt of this Life, in
Compariſon of the future, was the chief Foundation
of his Conduct.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a remarkable Contraſt do theſe two Men
ſtand: Yet both of them have met with univerſal
Admiration in their different Ages, and have been
propos'd as Models of Imitation. Where then is
the univerſal Standard of Morals, which you talk
of? And what Rule ſhall we eſtabliſh for the many
different, nay contrary Sentiments of Mankind?</p>
            <p>AN Experiment, ſaid I, that ſucceeds in the Air,
will not always ſucceed in a Vacuum. When Men
depart from the Maxims of common Reaſon, and
affect theſe <hi>artificial</hi> Lives, as you call them, no-one
can anſwer for what will pleaſe or diſpleaſe them.
They are in a different Element from the reſt of
Mankind; and the natural Principles of their Mind
play not with the ſame Regularity, as if left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
free from the Illuſions of religious Superſtition
or philoſophical Enthuſiaſm.</p>
