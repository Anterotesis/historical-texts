            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <q>Bonnel Thornton, Eſq.—It is well known that our hero, in conjunction with this celebrated writer, wrote, or rather compiled, a periodical paper entitled the <hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> which was firſt publiſhed ſome years paſt at Oxford. The latter having written a number of this work which he particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, requeſted his colleague to go poſt with it to Oxford, and to correct it with his own hand. On <hi>Coley</hi>'s arrival, <hi>Jackſon</hi> the printer informed him, that the publication muſt inevitably be ſtopt if he had not the copy in two hours at fartheſt. Here was an offer of <hi>immortality</hi> the poet could not forego! He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that having been a <hi>bon vivant</hi> the preceding evening, he was but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently prepared for the taſk, yet if he would furniſh him with a room, pen, ink and paper, he would ſee what could be done. Being accommodated to his wiſhes, he <hi>tranſcribed</hi> his friend <hi>Thornton</hi>'s eſſay, and delivered it for the preſs in little more than an hour. <hi>Jackſon</hi> was aſtoniſhed at the <hi>rapidity</hi> of his genius; and this identical paper making a conſiderable noiſe in the world at that time, the printer, as in duty bound, proclaimed the velocity of his author's fancy; a circumſtance which procured him that <hi>merited</hi> fame, he never after could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, or even forced to reſign.<bibl>BATE.</bibl>

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Here again we catch our poet at plagiariſm. This metamorphoſis is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably ſtolen from the following prediction in his epitaph above-cited, written on his theatrical deceaſe, by that exemplary divine and reverend poet Mr. Henry Bate.—Speaking of his flight to the celeſtial regions, his reverence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically ſuggeſts the ſame transformation. <q>
                           <l>Alas! what aſſailants his march will oppoſe,</l>
                           <l>Demanding their fragment each ſtep that he goes?</l>

                           <l>When each has diſmantled this daw of his feather,</l>
                           <l>How the devil, unfledg'd, will he waft himſelf thither;</l>
                           <l>For fate will demand (in deſpite of pretences)</l>
                           <l>A full expiation for all his offences;</l>

                           <l>And ſoaring aloft, high in air wildly ſhake him.</l>
                           <l>When in penance thus comic, the culprit appears,</l>
                           <l>What ſallies of laughter ſhall run thro' the ſpheres!</l>
                           <l>Nay, as great folks love fun, one may venture the odds,</l>
