            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE hint of this Piece was taken from one of the <hi>Contes Moraux</hi> of <hi>Marmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi> ſtiled <hi>L'Hereux Divorce.</hi> The foible ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed in the tale is, perhaps, the only one imputed to our ſex which has never yet been expoſed by a theatrical repreſentation. It is a ſimplicity, not a coquetry; it is the error of a delicate and elevated mind, unacquainted with the manners of real life, or the general frame of the human heart.</p>
            <p>The novel was too barren of incident to furniſh out an entertainment for the ſtage, which obliged me to contrive an intire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot, and introduce ſeveral new charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Comedy, which I ſhall not take up the reader's time to point out here; and ſubmit this performance to the candor and clemency of the public, after having, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, too adventurouſly hazarded their criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm and cenſure.</p>

                     <p>Why really, Clarinda, I look upon it, that next to the felicity of widowhood is that of being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. However, there are, my dear, ſome mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial differences: While the tyrant lives to whom we have been bound, we never can forget we have been ſlaves. There are, beſides, ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable circumſtances which attend a ſeparation, from which, thank Heaven, my ſtate is free.</p>

                     <p>You mean, I ſuppoſe, the power a huſband has of withdrawing alimony, in caſe of indiſcretion, and forcing the wretched wife upon certain <hi>moyens de vivre,</hi> whether ſhe will or no.</p>

                     <p>True.

She dies for ſentimental paſſion; and when once her romance is known, I warrant we ſhall be able to ſupply her with pretenders enough, who may aſſume by turns, the crook and ſcrip, the helmet and the lance, to hold her in play. Nay, piqued as ſhe was at what ſhe ſtiled lord Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's indifference toward her, I am perſuaded that if one tender tear had but gliſtened in his eye, at the inſtant of their ſeparation, ſhe would have ſunk into his arms, and like the plaintive turtle, have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0387601000:10"/>
moaned and cooed away the remainder of her life, in true conjugal inſipidity.</p>

Heigh ho! why cannot I repeat the reſt? Dear unhappy Eloiſe; but oh! far more unhappy lady Frankland! She had experienced thoſe tranſports ſhe ſo feelingly deſcribes, whilſt I, unhappy I, with all the tenderneſs of fond affections glowing in my breaſt, was doomed to the embraces of a marble ſtatue! Surely my glaſs deceives me, or I might well inſpire that ardent love which lifts us to the ſkies upon its ſeraph's wings. Cruel parents, was it for you I wedded! you choſe, indeed, a man of worth and honour for me: O, the rare gift! but to become once weary of a faultleſs perſon, is to be doomed to laſſitude for life. This ſurely, is ſevere!</p>

                     <p>My dear wild girl, you have wandered very far from my meaning.

For, to deal candidly, what right had I to have expected that lord Frankland ſhould be a paſſionate lover? what ſacrifice had I made him? by what heroic devotement had I awakened the ſenſibility of his ſoul? where was the merit of having obeyed my parents, and accepted for an huſband one, to whom I could poſſibly have no exception?</p>

                     <p>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you talk ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and put me in mind of a young lady of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, deeply verſed in romance, who, with a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0387601000:19"/>
large fortune, ran away with an enſign; but when they had got clear off, ſhe would not be content unleſs he returned and ſuffered her to leap out of a window to him: The experiment was made, and the poor lady diſcovered, and confined, till a more ſuitable match could be found out for her.</p>

I wiſh he, or the Devil had her. I know not what to think of her. I greatly fear ſhe may be honeſt. But if I can contrive any method to ruin her in lord Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's opinion, 'tis quite equal, and ſhe may then remain as chaſte as ſhe pleaſes, for me. This French

woman may be of uſe: She certainly knows her lady's ſecrets; and it will be very extraordinary, if an Engliſhman's gold, and an Iriſhman's kiſſes, may not be able to open the lock of that curious repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory. She may aſſiſt in my deſign on Emilia too, whom I am determined to have, were it only to gratify my pique.</p>

                     <p>No, Sir Harry, a heart like mine has nothing to diſguiſe—If I bluſhed, it was not ſhame, but pride, that glowed upon my cheek, from the ſlight notion you ſeem to have conceived of me, that among the trifling characters which frequent my drawing room, there could be found one capable of attaching my confidence, or regards.</p>

                     <p>Surely the provocation muſt have been great that could tempt them to draw in the park. I thought Sir William had more temper and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Do you know the ſubject of this quarrel?</p>

                     <p>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive yourſelf, and then argue right, upon wrong principles. You muſt certainly imagine lord Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a monſter, before you can ſuppoſe it poſſible for him to rejoice at your diſhonour. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I am certain he would be ſenſible of the higheſt concern, were he acquainted even with your preſent diſtreſs.</p>

                     <p>You judge too hardly of yourſelf, my dear; but I have ſtrong hopes that this unlucky affair will never reach his, or any other ears. Sir Harry has nothing to boaſt of; we may therefore depend on his ſilence; and I have too good an opinion of Sir William Belville, to ſuppoſe him capable of ever

                     <p>Grant it ſhould remain a ſecret, Emilia; how painful muſt my ſituation be! conſcious of the higheſt obligation, which I muſt not acknowledge, even to the generous hand that has conferr'd it To a mind open and grateful as mine, this muſt be torture.</p>

                     <p>Have a care, lady Frankland, of over-rating the obligation. Sir William knows that your ſituation cannot admit of a return, and if I am not much deceiv'd with regard to his character, his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are too generous to expect one.</p>

But alas! what arms are theſe, to combat the charms of flattery, the attractions of

                     <speaker>Sir WILLIAM.</speaker>
                     <p>After the declaration you made this morning; it ſurprizes me, madam, to find you in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired ſituation.</p>

                     <p>One often ſays more, Sir William, as well as leſs, than they think, according to the degree of ſpirits they happen to be in. I confeſs myſelf a rattle, and have vivacity enough to be fond of public places. Yet, I very ſoon tire of them, and frequently prefer the gaiety of theſe little objects, which I can create with my pencil, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own thoughts, to the more glaring ſhadows which ſurround me abroad, and no thought at all. 'Tis vaſtly pleaſant to think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, Sir William.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>They are, indeed, truly unhappy who do not find it ſo. Guilt alone can make reflection pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

                     <p>I muſt differ with you, Sir William; for I really know many good ſort of people, who I am ſure

have nothing to reproach themſelves with, yet for want of an early habit, dread ſitting alone, as much as if they feared ſpirits, and would run into any kind of company, rather than endure their own.</p>

                     <p>Deluſion all! they never yet exiſted in your breaſt; ſelf-love alone aſſumed the form of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental paſſion, and has impoſed on you, but never ſhall again on me.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                     <p>True love requires no ſacrifice, but the heart; ſelf love muſt have its triumphs: ſuſpicion is its conſtant mate, and the leaſt degree of complaiſance ſhewn to another object, appears a robbery to ſelfiſh minds.

                     <p>Far from it, Sir William; I wiſh your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo far as it may not be inconſiſtent with my own; and by depriving you of all right to be jealous, I lay you under the happy neceſſity of ceaſing to be ſo.

But alas, my friend, have I not reaſon to accuſe my fate, for turning thoſe advantages, which are deemed a bleſſing to my ſex, into a curſe for me! youth, beauty, innocence, and ſenſibility, to what have ye reduced me! to become the ſport of fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, or victim of jealouſy!

                     <p>I can't agree with you, Clarinda, though even Sir Harry has failed. For I dare ſwear no woman ever parted from her huſband, with a deſign of playing the drude with all the reſt of the world.

                     <p>Why then, in plainer Engliſh, Sir William is grown jealous, and will, if poſſible, prevent any other man from coming near her. By this means, ſhe will find herſelf priſoner, and may then probably ſurrender her perſon, to obtain her liberty, en parole, at leaſt.</p>

                     <p>Ay, but you underſtand me, for all that, Clarinda. You know full well that when a woman puts herſelf into the power of a man, he becomes a tyrant, ſhe a ſlave, from that moment; and all the difference I can find, between marriage and gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is, that one is perpetual, the other temporary, only.</p>

               <l>Well! ſure, of all the epilogues I ever read,</l>
               <l>This is the dulleſt! ah! that head! that head!</l>
               <l>Such flimſy, poor, quaint traſh, was never penn'd!</l>

               <l>But hold<hi>—Piano,</hi> gentlefolks—For here</l>
               <l>I'm running on, without all ſenſe of fear—</l>
               <l>What's this to'th' play? <stage>(puts up the paper)</stage> our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, there ſhe ſits!</l>
               <l>As I'm alive, ſhe's going into fits!</l>
               <l>Our female bard—the writer of this play—</l>
               <l>Dear me! what is't that I was go'ng to ſay?</l>
               <l>Lord, I'm ſo flounder'd! ſo confuſed!—No ſcheme</l>
               <l>To bring me off!—I'll tell you an odd dream—</l>
               <l>Not mine—t'was hers—So I'll juſt give you a hint,</l>
               <l>And leave you to infer what meaning's in't.</l>
               <l>Our Sappho took a nap—you'll ſay you know it;</l>
               <l>Is that uncommon in a modern poet?</l>

But let that paſs—When borne on fancy's wing,</l>
               <l>To the ſmoth brink of the Caſtalian ſpring,</l>
               <l>She quaff'd ſo large a draught, it turned her brain</l>
               <l>As mad—as ſome of you are with champaign—</l>
               <l>Straight ſhe began to rave 'bout <hi>inſpiration!</hi>

                  <hi>Plot—diction—moral—ſentiment—</hi>and <hi>paſſion.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then ſcrambling up <hi>Parnaſſus'</hi> mount, ſhe ſpied</l>
               <l>The fiery <hi>Pegaſus—</hi>and vow'd ſhe'd ride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now I've been told, d'ye ſee, that this ſame ſteed,</l>
               <l>Skittiſh, and fleet as your <hi>Newmarket</hi> breed,</l>
               <l>Has dev'liſh pranks—and none but men can ride him,</l>
               <l>How aukard muſt our petticoats beſtride him</l>
               <l>'Faith, ſo it prov'd!</l>
               <l>For as ſhe, one foot in, and one foot out,</l>
               <l>Was tittuping her <hi>hobby-horſe</hi> about,</l>
               <l>He gave a ſudden friſk, reared up in th' air</l>
               <l>And canted Sappho off—among ye there!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O dire prognoſtic of her preſent ſtate!</l>

               <l>Explain this dream—O be our <hi>Art'midorus!</hi>
               </l>
