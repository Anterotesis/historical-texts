            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the public, for their favourable reception of THE EARL OF WARWICK. He flatters himſelf, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe ſo neceſſary to his plan, which he has taken in common with other writers, in deviating from hiſtorical truth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a period ſo diſtant and obſcure, will meet with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </gap> that the ſame candour which approv'd on the ſtage, will accompany it to the cloſet.</p>
            <p>He cannot, without the moſt manifeſt injuſtice, forbear to add, that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers, diſplay'd by the principal actors concerned in it, contributed in a great meaſure to the ſucceſs of the performance.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>SEVERE each poet's lot; but ſure moſt hard</l>
               <l>Is the condition of the playhouſe bard:</l>
               <l>Doom'd to hear all that wou'd-be critics talk,</l>
               <l>And in the go-cart of dull rules to walk!</l>
               <l>"Yet authors multiply," you ſay. 'Tis true.</l>
               <l>But what a numerous crop of critics too!</l>
               <l>Scholars alone of old durſt judge and write;</l>
               <l>But now each journaliſt turns Stagyrite.</l>
               <l>Quintilians in each coffee-houſe you meet,</l>
               <l>And many a Longinus walks the ſtreet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In Shakeſpear's days, when his advent'rous muſe,</l>
               <l>A muſe of fire! durſt each bold licence uſe,</l>
               <l>Her noble ardour met no critic's phlegm,</l>
               <l>To check wild fancy, or her flights condemn:</l>
               <l>Ariels and Calibans unblam'd ſhe drew,</l>
               <l>Or goblins, ghoſts, and witches, brought to view.</l>
               <l>If to hiſtoric truth ſhe ſhap'd her verſe,</l>
               <l>A nation's annals freely ſhe'd rehearſe;</l>
               <l>Bring Rome's or England's ſtory on the ſtage,</l>
               <l>And run, in three ſhort hours, thro' half an age.</l>
               <l>Our bard, all terror-ſtruck, and fill'd with dread,</l>
               <l>In Shakeſpear's awful footſteps dares not tread;</l>
               <l>Thro' the wide field of hiſt'ry fears to ſtray,</l>
               <l>And builds upon one narrow ſpot his play;</l>
               <l>Steps not from realm to realm, whole feas between,</l>
               <l>But barely changes twice or thrice his ſcene:</l>
               <l>While Shakeſpear vaults on the poetic wire,</l>
               <l>And pleas'd ſpectators fearfully admire,</l>
               <l>Our bard, a critic pole between his hands,</l>
               <l>On the tight-rope, ſcarce balanc'd, trembling ſtands;</l>
               <l>Slowly and cautiouſly his way he makes,</l>
               <l>And fears to fall at ev'ry ſtep he takes:</l>
               <l>While then fierce Warwick he before you brings,</l>
               <l>That ſetter-up and puller-down of kings,</l>
               <l>With Britiſh candour diſſipate his ſear!</l>
               <l>An Engliſh ſtory fits an Engliſh ear.</l>
               <l>Tho' harſh and crude you deem his firſt eſſay,</l>
               <l>A ſecond may your favours well repay;</l>
               <l>Applauſe may nerve his verſe, and chear his heart,</l>
               <l>And teach the practice of this dangerous art.</l>
