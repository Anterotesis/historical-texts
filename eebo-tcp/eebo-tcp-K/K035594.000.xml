            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IN the very moment, when I was concluding the Notes to this Elegy, I received an Elegiac Poem on the ſame ſubject, by a Gentleman, whoſe extenſive knowledge of Indian Literature, and whoſe acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with its lamented Patron, induced me to peruſe his Publication with peculiar eagerneſs. There is ſo much poetical merit in the animated and graceful tribute, which Mr. MAURICE has paid to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Sir WILLIAM JONES, that, had I ſeen it before the completion of theſe Stanzas, it might have induced me to relinquiſh a ſubject pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged by a Writer ſo peculiarly qualified to treat it with ſucceſs. Yet the literary excellence of Sir WILLIAM JONES appears to require ſome kind of homage from every man of letters; and by the ſpirit of Mr. MAURICE'S performance, I am perſuaded, that our common regard for the Character we commemorate, is ſo ſincere and ingenuous, that we muſt rejoice in a multiplicity of offerings to a name ſo entitled to univer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſal praiſe.</p>

               <p>THE honourable Sir JOHN SHORE, who ſucceeded Sir WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM JONES as preſident of the Aſiatic ſociety, delivered, in his firſt addreſs to that aſſembly, a very juſt and eloquent eulogium on his accompliſhed predeceſſor.—Some lines in the preceding ſtanza allude to the following paſſage in the diſcourſe of Sir JOHN SHORE.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Pandits, who were in the habit of attending him (Sir WM. JONES) when I ſaw them after his death, at a public Durbar, could neither ſuppreſs their tears for his loſs, nor find terms to expreſs their admiration at the wonderful progreſs he had made in their ſciences.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall embrace with pleaſure every opportunity of illuſtrating this poem, and of honouring the juſtly lamented perſonage, whom it aſpires to celebrate, by unreſerved quotation of the manly and graceful panegyric, from which I have tranſcribed the preceding paragraph.</p>

               <p>THE erudition of Sir WILLIAM JONES was admirable not only from its extraordinary extent, but from having been acquired, to an aſtoniſhing degree, at a very early period of life. <q>Before the expiration of his twenty-ſecond year (ſays his friend and eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt) he had compleated his Commentaries on the Poetry of the Aſiatics, although a conſiderable time afterwards elapſed before their publication.</q> Sir JOHN proceeds to commend this work very juſtly, as a compleat proof of the Author's conſummate ſkill in a variety of languages, and as a juvenile monument of taſte, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and application, without example. Let me add, that this early production diſcovers alſo a heart full of gentle affections, and a mind that already conceived and expreſſed its ideas with ſingular energy and freedom. I allude particularly to the very pathetic tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of gratitude and praiſe, which the Author paid, in his Prooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium, to his friend and inſtructor, then recently deceaſed, (RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT SUMNER, the maſter of Harrow ſchool) and to the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages of the book; in the firſt he is ſpeaking of ſatire, in the ſecond of heroic poetry. <q>Atqui ut aperte dicam quod ſentio, valde invitus in poetarum chorum ſatyricos, ut vocan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, aſcribo.

               <p>THIS verſe alludes to the following paſſage, towards the cloſe of an admirable Preface to the Life of NADER SHAH, new modelled for the benefit of the Engliſh reader, and publiſhed in 1773:</p>

It is a painful conſideration, that the profeſſion of Literature, by far the moſt laborious of any, leads to no real benefit or true glory whatſoever. Poetry, Science, Letters, when they are not made the ſole buſineſs of life, may become its ornaments in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and its moſt pleaſing conſolation in a change of fortune; but if a man addicts himſelf entirely to learning, and hopes by <hi>that</hi> either to raiſe a family, or to acquire, what ſo many wiſh for, and ſo few ever attain, an honourable retirement in his declining age, he will find, when it is too late, that he has miſtaken his path; that other labours, other ſtudies are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and that unleſs he can aſſert his own independence in active life, it will avail him little to be favoured by the learned, eſteemed by the eminent, or recommended even by kings.</q>
               <p>Theſe reflections can hardly be ſuggeſted too frequently to the conſideration of thoſe ingenuous youths, who happen to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a very ardent paſſion for literature. It was happy for our great Orientaliſt, that his own peculiar energy of mind enabled him to form ſuch reflections at an early period of life, before the gates of profeſſional proſperity were barred againſt his laudable ambition; otherwiſe it is but too probable, that with unexampled hoards of erudition, united to a moſt benevolent temper, he might have pined in a ſtate of neglect and mortification, inſtead of riſing to be one of the moſt conſpicuous and moſt uſeful characters in the poliſhed age, which his writings have contributed to enlighten and adorn.</p>
               <p>I cannot cloſe this note without remarking, that the Preface to the Engliſh Life of NADER SHAH, which gave riſe to it, contains many excellent remarks on hiſtorical writing. It was the cuſtom of our univerſal ſcholar to delineate, in a philoſophic and maſterly ſurvey, the province of literature, to which the object of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate labour belonged. Thus to his volume of Aſiatic Poems he has added two admirable Eſſays on Poetry; and his tranſlation of ISAEUS is elucidated by a prefatory diſcourſe, and a commentary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0309500200:27"/>
replete with legal and claſſical information. As a writer, both of verſe and proſe, his conſummate knowledge of languages enabled him to vary and adapt his ſtyle to his ſubject with all the graces of exquiſite propriety.</p>

"When I was at ſea laſt Auguſt, on my voyage to this country, which I had long and ardently deſired to viſit, I found one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on inſpecting the obſervations of the day, that India lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and Perſia on our left, while a breeze from Arabia blew nearly on our ſtern. A ſituation ſo pleaſing in itſelf, and to me ſo new, could not fail to awaken a train of reflections in a mind, which had early been accuſtomed to contemplate with delight the eventful hiſtories, and agreeable fictions of this Eaſtern world. It gave me inexpreſſible pleaſure to find myſelf in the midſt of ſo noble an amphitheatre, almoſt encircled by the vaſt regions of Aſia, which has ever been eſteemed the nurſe of ſciences, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventreſs of delightful and uſeful arts, the ſcene of glorious actions, fertile in the productions of human genius, abounding in natural wonders, and infinitely diverſified in the forms of religion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the laws, manners, cuſtoms, and languages, as well as in the features and complexions of men; I could not help remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how important and extenſive a field was yet unexplored, and how many ſolid advantages unimproved."—<hi>Aſiatick Reſearches,</hi> vol. i. p. 9.</p>
               <p>Theſe reflections led Sir WILLIAM, by degrees, to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aſiatic Society, and never was a man more happily qualified, by nature and education, to be the founder and the guide of ſuch a reſpectable inſtitution; ſince, in addition to his own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular talents for the rapid acquiſition and ready communication of knowledge, he was diſtinguiſhed by ſuch engaging manners as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him moſt happily to call forth and encourage the faculties of all around him.

               <p>A YOUNG Student may find a moſt pleaſing incentive to mental exertion, in contemplating the very wonderful literary acquiſitions and atchievements of Sir WILLIAM JONES; a regular and minute enumeration and eſtimate of theſe we may hope to ſee from the leiſure of ſome accompliſhed individual among his many Aſiatic friends, whom an intimate acquaintance with his extenſive labours, and an equal affection for his endearing virtues, may engage in the office of his Biographer. The Memorial of Sir JOHN SHORE is an excellent prelude to ſuch a work. Sir JOHN, after mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his predeceſſor's moſt remarkable productions, inſerts in his diſcourſe a paper entitled <hi>"Deſiderata,"</hi> a liſt of 23 curious and important projected works, relating to India, Arabia, China, and Tartary. On this paper of his departed friend he makes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervation:</p>
               <p>"We are not authorized to conclude, that he had himſelf form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a determination to compleat the works which his genius and knowledge had thus ſketched; the taſk ſeems to require a period beyond the probable duration of any human life; but we, who had the happineſs to know Sir WILLIAM JONES, who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his indefatigable perſeverance in the purſuit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of his ardour to accompliſh whatever he deemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant: who ſaw the extent of his intellectual powers, his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful attainments in literature and ſcience, and the facility with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0309500200:30"/>
which all his compoſitions were made, cannot doubt, if it had pleaſed Providence to protract the date of his exiſtence, that he would have ably executed much of what he had ſo extenſively planned.</p>
               <p>It cannot be deemed uſeleſs or ſuperfluous to enquire, by what arts or method he was enabled to attain to a degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge almoſt univerſal, and apparently beyond the powers of man, during a liſe little exceeding forty-ſeven years.</p>
               <p>"The faculties of his mind, by nature vigorous, were improved by conſtant exerciſe, and his memory, by habitual practice, had acquired a capacity of retaining whatever had been once impreſſed upon it. To an unextinguiſhed ardour for univerſal knowledge, he joined a perſeverance in the purſuit of it, which ſubdued all obſtacles; his ſtudies began with the dawn, and during the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of profeſſional duties, were continued throughout the day. Reflection and meditation ſtrengthened and confirmed what induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and inveſtigation had accumulated. It was a fixt principle with him, from which he never voluntarily deviated, not to be deterred, by any difficulties that were ſurmountable, from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting to a ſucceſsful termination, what he had once deliberately undertaken.</p>
               <p>"But what appears to me to have enabled him to employ his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents ſo much to his own and the public advantage, was the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar allotment of his time to particular occupations, and a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous adherence to the diſtribution which he had fixed; hence all his ſtudies were purſued without interruption or confuſion. Nor can I here omit remarking, what may probably have attracted your obſervation as well as mine, the candour and complacency with which he gave his attention to all perſons, of whatſoever quality, talent, or education: he juſtly concluded, that curious or important information might be gained from the illiterate; and wherever it was to be obtained, he ſought and ſeized it."</p>
               <p>

In the very brief liſt of eminent men, who have compleatly united the oppoſite advantages ariſing from a life of buſineſs and a life of meditation, perhaps Cicero is the perſonage, who may be moſt properly compared with Sir WILLIAM JONES. The great Roman has been often conſidered as without a parallel in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and magnitude of his mental accompliſhments; yet who will now heſitate to declare, that, in extent of erudition, in elegance and energy of mind, and above all in the tenderneſs and integrity of his private and public life, he was far from being ſuperior to our accompliſhed countryman.</p>

               <p>FROM an ardent and truly noble deſire to befriend the natives of that country, where he was appointed to adminiſter juſtice, Sir WILLIAM JONES was led "to ſuggeſt to government a work of national utility and importance, the compilation of a copious digeſt of Hindu and Mahommedan laws, from Sanſcrit and Arabic originals, with an offer of his ſervices to ſuperintend the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and with a promiſe to tranſlate it.—To the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this work, which was immediately undertaken at his ſuggeſtion, he aſſiduouſly devoted thoſe hours, which he could ſpare from his profeſſional duties.</p>
               <p>"During the courſe of this compilation, and as auxiliary to it, he was led to ſtudy the works of MENU, reputed by the Hindus to be the oldeſt and holieſt of legiſlators, and finding them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize a ſyſtem of religious and civil duties, and of law in all its branches, ſo comprehenſive and minutely exact, that it might be conſidered as the inſtitutes of Hindu law, he preſented a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the government of Bengal."—<hi>Sir John Shore's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi>

               <p>When Sir WILLIAM JONES enquired of "a very ſenſible Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which of the Indian dramas was moſt univerſally eſteemed, he anſwered without heſitation Sacontala, ſupporting his opinion, as uſual among the Pandits, by a couplet to this effect:</p>
               <p>"The Ring of Sacontala, in which the 4th act, and four ſtanzas of that act are eminently brilliant, diſplays all the rich ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberance of Calidaſa's genius."</p>
               <p>This circumſtance induced our great Orientaliſt to peruſe and tranſlate Sacontala, which he has given to the public, to uſe his own very juſt expreſſions, "as a moſt pleaſing and authentic pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of old Hindu manners, and one of the greateſt curioſities that

               <p>Let me add, that it is poſſible he may have rendered infinitely greater ſervices to religion by the admirable ſuggeſtion in the cloſe of his Diſcourſe on the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India. He

there points out what occurred to him as the only promiſing mode of converting the Muſulmans and Hindus to Chriſtianity; and perhaps the moſt worthy honour, which the Aſiatic Society could pay to the memory of Sir WILLIAM JONES, would be to reſume and realize his idea: the experiment is eaſy, and ſhould it ſucceed in any degree, that ſucceſs will form the nobleſt eulogy of the beneficent ſpirit, by whom it was ſuggeſted.</p>
