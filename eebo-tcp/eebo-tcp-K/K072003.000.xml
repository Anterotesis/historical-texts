            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

you in mind that I have march'd under all your Banners in many Winter Colds and Summer Heats, and given Proofs of my <hi>Conduct,</hi> if not of my Courage, and have diſciplin'd ſome of your Troops. <hi>Tho' my Enemies have beat me to the Pit</hi> (as <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaid), yet, thank Heaven! ſome few Friends have interpos'd, and prevented my falling in: There is a Conſolation in Innocence that is our beſt Shield.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>A PREFACE</hi> is Part of the Habit to a <hi>Book,</hi> and no Author can appear full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd without it: 'Tis a <hi>Cockade</hi> to an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, a <hi>Noſegay</hi> to a Lawyer, a <hi>Patch</hi> or a <hi>Fan</hi> to a fine Lady, or, a <hi>Ribband</hi> to her Lap-Dog.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould tell my Readers, I am prevailed upon with great Intreaties from my Friends to publiſh this Piece, I ſhould embark with a Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (for it is my own Free-will, Act and Deed); and I would willingly have my Readers believe I publiſh nought but Truth. My Cargo is genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and I have taken up but little on Credit.</p>
            <p>If the good Reader ſhould find better Scraps of Rhyme than my own (which I preſume will not be over-difficult), I have given them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Marks, that there may be no Doubts on that Account.</p>
            <p>The numerous Notes I have ſqueezed in, are meant to divert; if I loſe my Aim, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf with conſidering, I may be but one among ten thouſand that have been miſtaken.</p>
            <p>I have unnumbered Thanks to many in this Kingdom, and in particular to a young Gentleman whoſe Good-nature has been indefatigable in my Intereſt. The other a Gentleman eminent in the
<pb facs="tcp:0483300100:6"/>
Law, who has made my Cauſe his own. It gives me great Concern I am not permitted pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to own their unbounded Goodneſs and Generoſity, ſince ſuch <hi>Sterling</hi> Friends are but ſeldom met with by Wretches in Misfortune.</p>
            <p>I am <hi>Unfortunate</hi> I own, but (as <hi>Oroonoko</hi> ſays) <hi>not aſhamed of being ſo.</hi> I bear all with Patience and Chearfulneſs; which I find has occaſion'd the following Flight of Poetry from a Friend. I know Authors often write to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet I'll aſſure you, on my Veracity, it is not the Caſe here; tho' I muſt allow a little Vanity in my Compoſition makes me willing to inſert it.</p>

            <head>A General HISTORY OF THE STAGE.</head>
            <p>THE STAGE is almoſt as old as the ſacred Inſpiration of the Muſe; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, when at <hi>Nurſe,</hi> and even in its Infant Prattle, pleaſing: Born in <hi>Greece,</hi> and nouriſh'd at <hi>Athens.</hi> A merry Author ſays, in a Prologue,

            <p>The early Stages were, indeed, no more than native Turf, or Sod; and what was firſt exhibited, of a Piece, ſimple Paſtoral Songs, ſometimes mix'd with Scandal or Abuſe, and, may be, home Truths; like the <hi>Terrae Filius</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or the blazoning <hi>Peccadillos</hi> of two

            </p>
            <p>From theſe Turf Stages, the Players, ſuch as they were, mounted a Cart, or ſome ſuch Vehicle, and began to travel Bag and Baggage, perhaps like the Picture of the Itinerants in <hi>Scarron</hi>'s comical Romance.

            <p>The firſt Theatre in <hi>Athens</hi> was built, by the Directions of <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> at the public Charge. It was a wooden Pile, yet very ſpacious. But at the Repreſentation of one of the Tragedies compos'd by <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> according to <hi>Suidas,</hi> the Building gave way, by the monſtrous Weight of 20000 Spectators, and many were kill'd and maim'd. To prevent ſuch fatal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents for the future, the City order'd one more magnificent to be erected, intirely built with Stone, capable of holding half the Inhabitants without the former Danger: Some Authors ſay of Marble, ſurpaſſing, in Elegance, the Temples of their Gods. It conſiſted of two Parts, the <hi>Scena,</hi> and <hi>Cavea:</hi> The <hi>Scena,</hi> that Part which form'd the Stage, and other Conveniencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it; the upper Part for their <hi>Scenes</hi> and <hi>Machinery,</hi> which were generally flat Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, with all the Variety of Painting, let oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally down to vary the Proſpect, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage

the Machinery; as <hi>Lee</hi> intimates, in the Tragedy of <hi>Oedipus:</hi>

               </q>
The <hi>Cavea</hi> was the Place where the Spectators were ſeated: The under Part of the Stage was form'd for raiſing any thing particular for the different Performances, where were alſo placed the brazen Tubes for Thunder, and Utenſils for Lightning, and many other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, according to <hi>Graevius:</hi>
               <q>

            <p>It may well be aſk'd by Numbers, If theſe <hi>Theatres</hi> were ſo large and ſpacious, what ſort of <hi>Theatrical</hi> Performers muſt thoſe diſtant Ages produce?

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0483300100:12"/>
Senſes of Hearing and Seeing were much the ſame as now: But as to the Voice, that, indeed, doubtleſs, wanted Aſſiſtance; which to help, they had Coverings to the whole Head and Face, and over the Face a <hi>Maſk,</hi> with a Mouth only, to ſtrengthen the Sound of the Voice; in my poor Opinion, wretched Aſſiſtance! Where were the <hi>Eyes</hi> and Muſcles of the Countenance, to command, implore, exult, upbraid, conſent, refuſe, and all thoſe different Paſſions that agitate the Mind, wherein the Eyes are the <hi>Index?</hi> Theſe <hi>Maſks</hi> were made to cover the Head, as was ſaid before, adorn'd with Hair proper to the Character the Actor was to repreſent upon the Stage. Madam <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier</hi> has given an engrav'd Specimen of ſeveral Maſks us'd on the <hi>Roman Theatre,</hi> in her Tranſlation of <hi>Terence,</hi> which ſhe procur'd in an ancient Manuſcript of that Author's Works. The <hi>Romans</hi> follow'd the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their <hi>Drama;</hi> ſo, we may be aſſured, theſe Helps came from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But as the Voice was to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd, ſo was the Perſon; therefore the <hi>Cothur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or <hi>Buſkin,</hi> was invented, not like our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Buſkin, but an Elevation of Perſon, half a Yard, or ſo, to emulate the Size of Immortals, or earthly Giants, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes; like our waggiſh Boys, appearing upon Stilts. But the <hi>Cothurnus</hi> was only made uſe of in Tragedy to <hi>ſtep ſtately;</hi> for if they had hurry'd, they might have been in ſome Danger of kiſſing the Ground: Neither could they, I ſuppoſe, pay Homage to their Monarch, or

their Miſtreſs, tho' perhaps, in thoſe Days, Kneeling was neither a Mark of Submiſſion, or Adoration, at leaſt among the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But thus are their Actors pictur'd out by many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> tells us, moſt of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Theatres were the chief of the Nobility, Perſons of great Learning and Dignity, <hi>Poets, Orators,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> even <hi>Kings</hi> did not diſdain to appear on the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Stage.

I ſhall leave the Antients to reſt quietly in their Graves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Drama</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and all over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> began as meanly as its firſt Original in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0483300100:19"/>
               <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> and our Poetry as crude. The firſt Play, at leaſt that has appeared in Print, was with this Title, <hi>Gammer Gurton</hi>'s <hi>Needle,</hi> a Comedy, acted at <hi>Chriſt's-College, Cambridge.</hi> Writ by Mr. S. Maſter of Arts. And an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Piece it is. <hi>Gammer Gurton</hi> has loſt her Needle, and truly great Hunt is made about it; her Boy is ſent to blow the Embers in order to light a Candle to help the Search. The damn'd Witch of a Cat is got in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with her two fiery Eyes. The Boy cries, <hi>It is the Devil of a Fire;</hi> for when he puffs, it's out; and when he does not, it's in. <hi>Stir it</hi>! cries Gammer <hi>Gurton.</hi> The Boy does as he's bid. The Fire, or rather the Cat, flies among a Pile of Wood; the Boy cries, <hi>The Houſe will be burnt</hi>! All Hands to work. The Cat is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by a Prieſt (having a little more Cunning than the reſt). This is the <hi>Epiſode.</hi> The main <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> are full as good. Gammer <hi>Gurton,</hi> it ſeems, had the Day before been mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Man <hi>Hodge</hi>'s Breeches. Now <hi>Hodge</hi> in ſome Game of Merriment was to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by three Slaps on the <hi>Bum,</hi> by the brawny open Hand of one of his Fellow Bumpkins. His Head is laid down in Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Gurton</hi>'s Lap; the firſt Slap is given—<hi>Hodge,</hi> with great Exclamation, bellows out, <hi>Oh</hi>! He declares his Grief! and ſearching for the Cauſe of his Pain—O, happy! the Needle was found bury'd up to the Eye in the Poſterior of poor <hi>Hodge</hi>! It was pull'd out with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0483300100:20"/>
by all but the Delinquent, who expreſs'd ſome Pain; and ſo ends this excellent <hi>Comedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Time has poliſh'd this Rudeneſs, and true <hi>Engliſh Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy</hi> is allow'd to ſtand in the utmoſt Perfection. Yet Bunglers will ſtill be dabbling. Every polite Nation delights in the <hi>Drama.</hi> The heavy <hi>Dutch</hi> have Plays in their own Language, but they are generally plann'd from the Old Teſtament. I had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of one given me, from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spectator. It was the Story of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> was arm'd with a <hi>Gun</hi> inſtead of a ſacrificing <hi>Knife.</hi> The Angel, to prevent the Gun from firing, ſprinkled ſome warm Water, a Diſtillation of its own making. The <hi>Ram</hi> in the Brake (which was repreſented by Boughs of Laurel) was a plump fat <hi>Dutchman</hi> (marry'd I ſuppoſe) with fair brow-ſpread Antlers on his Head, fix'd very artificially; and all the Decorations were of a Piece. But they have a handſome regular <hi>Theatre</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> occupy'd by a <hi>French</hi> Troop of <hi>Comedians.</hi> Even the diſtant <hi>Chineſe</hi> have very fine Theatres. I ſaw, in my Youth, a <hi>Chineſe</hi> Performance at <hi>Canton,</hi> where the <hi>Scenes, Machines,</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing and magnificent; but not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Language, <hi>the Glare growing familiar,</hi> as <hi>Addiſon</hi> ſays by Beauty,

                     <hi>Acoſta,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> before <hi>Cortez</hi> had conquer'd it, ſays, the <hi>Amantas,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Philoſophers, were alſo Poets, and invented <hi>Comedies</hi> and <hi>Tragedies,</hi> which were acted on their Feſtivals before the King, the Royal Family, and the Court; the Actors being the Noblemen and great Officers of the Army. The Subject of their <hi>Tragedies</hi> were the Victories and great Actions of their Anceſtors, which ſeem'd to be the beſt Means they had of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Memory of what was paſt. In their <hi>Comedies,</hi> their Huſbandry, their Houſhold Affairs and Commerce were repreſented, and the moſt remarkable Follies in Life expos'd.

                  <p>According to <hi>Lopez de Vega,</hi> the Chriſtian Religion was propagated among the <hi>Americans</hi> by the Theatre.

from Home? 'Tis Time to come back to our own Country, with this Obſervation, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Nations allow the <hi>Theatre</hi> a wiſe and inſtructive Amuſement. Even the Apoſtles did not diſapprove of Plays, and no doubt read them; for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> quotes <hi>Menander</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Comic Poet, and ſets down his own Phraſe in his own Words, xvth Chapter, 33d Verſe, <hi>Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd—Evil Communication corrupts good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Arts, Sciences, and even Trade, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flouriſh with the Theatre, and, I think, <hi>Religion</hi> and Politeneſs, and why may not the <hi>Drama</hi> be a great Mark of a civiliz'd Nation? The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were in their higheſt Glory when the <hi>Stage</hi> flouriſh'd. I need not ſay, that the <hi>Theatre</hi> in <hi>England</hi> came in with the Reformation, and the long-reign'd <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe great Learning not only made her give it Encouragement, but Sir <hi>Roger Naunton</hi> tells us, that great Queen tranſlated one of the Tragedies of <hi>Euripides</hi> from the

Our immortal <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> met Reward from that illuſtrious Princeſs, and her Influence brought forth his inimitable Genius to that high Luſtre, where it will ſhine unrival'd to after Ages, never once clouded but in the Time of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm, and drear Darkneſs of <hi>Canting</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy.

Ambition in great Minds ſtands rank'd in the Line of Virtue; but I think to bound it is more truly a Virtue, as ſweet-tongu'd <hi>Waller</hi> writes:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>If the ſucceſsful Troublers of Mankind,</l>

               <l>That ſtop their Progreſs, and their Rage oppoſe?</l>
               <l>Next to that Pow'r which does the Ocean awe,</l>
               <l>Is to ſet Bounds, and give Ambition Law.</l>

            <p>But let me ſet Bounds to myſelf.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Stage</hi> flouriſh'd in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, with ſuch excellent Dramatic Poets, <hi>viz. Shakeſpear, Ben Johnſon, Maſſenger,</hi> and many others, we may be well aſſur'd the <hi>Actors</hi> did not fall much

ſhort of the <hi>Writers.</hi> Nature is the ſame in every Age. <hi>Taylor, Burbidge, Lowen, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Condel, Allen, Maſon, Field, Tarlton,</hi> and others that performed in the Plays of <hi>Shakeſpear, Johnſon,</hi> &amp;c. have their public Praiſes in ſeveral cotemporary Authors. Mr. <hi>Marlow</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Malta</hi> (a Play acted before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and his Queen, at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in the Year 1633.) writes, "that Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> perform'd their Parts with that Excellence, that it was beyond conceiving." Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> in his Chronicles of <hi>England,</hi> at the latter End of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> after giving an Account of the eminent Perſons in that Reign, writes thus of three Actors: "Excellency in the meaneſt Things deſerves Remembrance. <hi>Richard Burbidge,</hi> and <hi>Edward Allen,</hi> two ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as no Age muſt ever look to ſee the like: And, to make their Comedies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, <hi>Richard Tarlton,</hi> for the <hi>Clown's</hi> Part, never had his Match, nor never will have." What this Writer calls the <hi>Clown's</hi> Part, were ſuch as <hi>Launcelot</hi> in the <hi>Merchant of Venice, Touchſtone</hi> in <hi>As you like it,</hi> the Fool in <hi>King Lear,</hi> and Parts of the Kind, which required Perſons of infinite Humour.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Heywood</hi> was not only an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Actor, but a very great Author, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Poet. I have read all his Works that are extant, and in my poor Judgment he may be accounted the firſt of the ſecond-rank'd Poets in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and

BURBIDGE. Mr. <hi>Richard Allen,</hi> another great Actor, founded and endowed a College <note n="p" place="bottom">This College was firſt deſigned for the Relief and Support of ſix Men, ſix Women, with ſix Children, Perſons thro' Indigence, Misfortunes, or old Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Theatres of <hi>London.</hi> But, when the Building was going forward, Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> having left off acting, he recommended a Door-keeper to his quondam Brother Actors; they abſolutely refuſed him that ſmall Favour, which ſo enraged him, that he turned his Bounty another Way. Both Parties, perhaps, to blame; but, I believe, few cenſured him <hi>out</hi> of the Theatres at that Time. He afterwards increaſed the Number of Children to twelve, from the Age of five Years, to be taught and maintained till 14 or 15. We may imagine the Founder no very great Friend to Matrimony, ſince he left Directions, that the Governor ſhould continue a Batchelor, and one of his own Name; and to give place to another <hi>Allen,</hi> ſhould he once change his Condition. The College is a noble Building, with a very handſome Chapel, the Altar-piece elegantly painted, with a well-ton'd Organ; and it is the Duty of the Organiſt to teach the Children to ſing the proper Services of the Church. The decent Decorum is admired by all. There is alſo an elegant Pleaſure-Garden, with a uſeful Orchard and Kitchen-Garden, all well-ſtock'd with the beſt Fruits, &amp;c. Fiſh-ponds, that yield large Quantities of <hi>Carp, Tench, Perch,</hi> and <hi>Eels.</hi> And, much to the Credit of the Managers of this Charity, the original Eſtate left by the Founder is more than trebled in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and they have Money in their Treaſury ready for another Purchaſe. I ſhall end this Account with what Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> writes in his Chronicle of <hi>England</hi> where he cloſes the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt: <q>About this Time (1624.) <hi>Edward Allen,</hi> of <hi>Dulwich</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> founded a fair Hoſpital at <hi>Dulwich,</hi> for ſix poor Men, ſix poor Women, and twelve poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the Age of four to ſix Years, to be there maintained and taught till the Age of Fourteen or Sixteen, and to have a Schoolmaſter, with Diet, and a convenient Stipend.

We have had great Generals, knowing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals, worthy Diſcoverers of new Worlds, as well as illuſtrious Poets, in the two laſt Ages; and why may not their cotemporary Theatrical Performers be as great in their Way? An Author, who wrote about Forty Years paſt, ſpeaks thus of Mr. <hi>Betterton:</hi> 
               <q>In the Tragedy of <hi>Hamlet</hi> Prince of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> performed the Part of young <hi>Hamlet.</hi> Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="bottom">Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> was, by many, ſuppoſed the natural Son of <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi> He ſucceeded <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> as Poet-Laureat in 1637. and obtained a Patent for a Company of Comedians from King <hi>Charles,</hi> and was knighted by that Monarch. He was accounted a great Poet, in ſeveral Branches of that Science: His Poem of <hi>Gondibert</hi> is eſteemed a noble Poem, which he wrote in <hi>France</hi> during his Exile with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. His Works are printed in Folio 1673, which contains 17 Dramatic Pieces, beſides his Poems, with his Head crowned with Laurel.

The Maſter begged the Knight's Pardon, and was for chaſtiſing his Servant with ſome Expoſtulations, as well as a Cudgel. <hi>Zounds, Sir,</hi> cry'd the Boy, <hi>it's very hard I muſt be corrected for my Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; the Gentleman blew his Noſe upon my Fiſh, and I was waſhing it off, that's all.</hi> The Jeſt pleaſed Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> ſo well, that he gave him a Piece of Money, and went away highly delighted. Since I have given you one old Jeſt upon the Noſe of Sir <hi>William,</hi> I'll venture to throw in another. As he was walking along the <hi>Mews,</hi> an importunate Beggar-woman teiz'd him for Charity, with often repeating, <hi>Heaven bleſs your Eye-ſight! God preſerve your Worſhip's Eye ſight—Why, what's the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with my Eye-ſight, Woman?</hi> reply'd Sir <hi>William, I find no Defect there. Ah! good Sir, I wiſh you never may,</hi> return'd the Beggar; <hi>for ſhould your Sight ever fail you, you muſt borrow a Noſe of your Neighbour to hang your Spectacles on.</hi> His Play of the <hi>Law againſt Lovers</hi> is <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s <hi>Meaſure for Meaſure,</hi> with a very little Alteration, and as <hi>little</hi> for the better. Sir <hi>William</hi> was the Contriver of painted Scenes in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theatres, as well as one of the firſt Introducers of ſinging Operas. There is a Work of this Kind, whoſe Title runs thus: <q>The Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> expreſſed by Inſtrumental and Vocal Muſic, and by Art of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective in Scenes, at the <hi>Cock-Pit</hi> in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> at three in the Afternoon, 1658.</q>

having ſeen Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> of the <hi>Black-Friers</hi> Playhouſe, act this Part (who was inſtructed by the Author <hi>Shakeſpear),</hi> remembred him ſo well, that he taught Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> in every Article; which, by his exact Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, gained the Actor Eſteem and Reputation ſuperlative to all the other Players.</q> This Account makes it plain <hi>Taylor</hi> muſt be very great in the Part, ſince <hi>Betterton,</hi> his Imitator, performed it ſo well. And <hi>Betterton,</hi> in the Memory of many, was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0483300100:30"/>
eſteemed the greateſt Actor of his Time. Read what the great <hi>Addiſon</hi> writes of him, who may be allowed a Judge of the Drama, as well as the Performers.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Such an Actor as Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> ought to be recorded with the ſame Reſpect as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcius</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> The greateſt Orator <hi>(Tully)</hi> has thought fit to quote his Judgment, and celebrate his Life. <hi>Roſcius</hi> was the Example to all that would form themſelves into proper and winning Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: His Action was ſo well adapted to the Sentiments he expreſſed, that the Youth of <hi>Rome</hi> thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as <hi>Roſcius.</hi> The Imagination took a lovely Impreſſion of what was great and good; and they who never thought of ſetting up for the Art of Imitation, became themſelves inimitable Characters. There is no human Invention ſo aptly calculated for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free-born People, as that of a <hi>Theatre. Tully</hi> reports, that the celebrated <hi>Roſcius</hi> uſed frequently to ſay, the Perfection of an <hi>Actor</hi> is, only to become what he is doing. I have hardly a Notion, that any Performer of Antiquity could ſurpaſs the Action of Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> in any of the Occaſions in which he has appeared on our Stage. The wonderful Agony which he appeared in, when he examined the Circumſtance of the Handkerchief in the Part of <hi>Othello;</hi> the Mixture of Love that intrudes upon his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0483300100:31"/>
Mind upon the innocent Anſwers <hi>Deſdemona</hi> makes; betrayed in his Geſture ſuch a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and Viciſſitude of Paſſion, as would admoniſh a Man to be afraid of his own Heart, and perfectly convince him, it is to ſtab it, to admit that worſt of Daggers, <hi>Jealouſy.</hi> Whoever reads in his Cloſet this admirable Scene will find, that he cannot (except he has as warm an Imagination as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> himſelf) find any but dry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent, and broken Sentences. But a Reader, that has ſeen <hi>Betterton</hi> act it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves there could not be a Word added; that longer Speeches had been unnatural, nay, impoſſible, in <hi>Othello</hi>'s Circumſtances. Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> the greateſt Critic of the Age he lived in, in his Diſſertation on Tragedy, ſpeaks thus on Mr. <hi>Hart:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eyes of the Audience are prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and charmed by his Action, before ought of the Poet can approach their Ears; and, to the moſt wretched of Characters, <hi>Hart</hi> gives a Luſtre which dazzles the Sight, that the Deformities of the Poet cannot be perceived.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now, after the Opinions of two ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Judges, why may we not ſuppoſe there were as great Stage Performers in Times paſt, as the preſent, without leſſening the Merit of thoſe that ſurvive? If, in my ſimple Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I allow the preſent equal to the paſt, I cannot allow that they exceed them, no more, perhaps, than the next Race of <hi>Theatrical</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0483300100:32"/>
will excel many that now grace the Stage. Excellency, in this Science, does not always run in the Blood, or, like Eſtates, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereditary. They muſt be born <hi>Actors,</hi> as well as <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters:</hi> Yet there are many Dabblers in all three; but, alas! how few come to Perfection! We very rarely ſee Brothers or Siſters, Sons or Daughters. or any of the relative Line (though they ſometimes take up the Calling, becauſe one of the Race flouriſhes in the Theatrical Field) ſucceed in their Attempts. A Monarch may give Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Titles of Honour, or add to his Peers, but no Power but that immortal Goddeſs <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> can form a perfect Actor: Yet ſome even of theſe forget their Inſtructreſs, and Faults invade them to ſully their Perfections. Every Performer on the Stage ought to take Virtue for his Guide. Precepts from the Pulpit will not have all their Efficacy from a <hi>Monitor</hi> without <hi>Morals.</hi> A Diſcourſe on Sobriety, on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> would loſe ſomething of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from an Orator known to baſte the Bottle about all the paſt <hi>Saturday</hi> Evening till the <hi>Noon of Night,</hi> as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſays. The Blind may hear, the Dumb and Deaf ſee, but every Senſe muſt be perfect to inſtruct, and be inſtructed. Performers, of both Sexes, ought to imitate thoſe virtuous Characters they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent upon the Stage; the Dignity of the Theatre, then, might emulate that of <hi>Athens.</hi> 'Tis not the Buſineſs brings Scandal to the Performers, if they will take care to avoid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0483300100:33"/>
drawing it upon themſelves. I have known the Managers of <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> and many of the reſt of the Fraternity, meet Regard, and even Reſpect, from Perſons of the firſt Rank, from their proper Behaviour; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced every one, with the like Conduct would meet with the like Treatment from People of Senſe and good Breeding; but the Two-legg'd Brutes of the Creation will be ever incorrigible: A decent Dreſs will become their Station; but Pride ought to be as far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from them, as the licenſed Inſtructors of Divine Inſtitution: For if Theatrical Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are Servants to the Public (as an eminent Actor publicly declared), they ſhould never attempt to out-dreſs their Maſters. <hi>Veluti in Speculum (behold as in a Glaſs),</hi> the Motto over the Front of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre, will ſerve both Auditors and Actors; and, I think, carries a more inſtructive Meaning than the other, of <hi>Vivitur Ingenio (we live by Wit),</hi> which only relates to the Stage. A bad Painter is ſeldom copy'd, and Excellence is only worth Imitation; Dreſs beyond Station is Pride, and Pride very often brings Self-puniſhment. I have known Fidlers and Dancing-maſters wear lac'd Cloaths, but they ſeldom improv'd any thing but the Taylor's Bill, and as much laugh'd at as the Baboon I have often ſeen in a lac'd Coat and a Bag-wig in the Parade at <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi>—Yet I have ſeen gold Fringe on ſilk Veſts, with white ſilk Stockens, worn by the Dancers on the Ropes at <hi>Sadlers-Wells,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0483300100:34"/>
that have bow'd and ſcrap'd in that rich Dreſs, picking up Halfpence thrown down by <hi>Coblers</hi> and <hi>Link-Boys.</hi> Such Sights put me in mind of the painted Eggs <note n="r" place="bottom">It is the Cuſtom of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> and many other ſtated Feſtivals, to ſend, as a friendly Preſent to their Acquaintance and Relations, painted Eggs, generally embelliſh'd with Flowers curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly drawn, Fruits, &amp;c. that are very often ſo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that the Money laid out for the painting of one would purchaſe a hundred, as ſimple Nature produc'd them, and are of no farther Uſe than to be look'd upon. This Cuſtom is kept up chiefly in the Holidays of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> in Commemoration of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> wiſe Men, led by the Star to viſit our <hi>Redeemer</hi> in the Manger at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> where they made their Preſents to the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. Theſe Eggs are ſometimes eaten in thoſe Days ordained, where Fleſh is ſorbidden, but not till the Sun is ſet, or, if no Sun appears, not till Candle-light.</note>of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> they don't reliſh the better for their Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gaudy Outſides. Even <hi>Roſcius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi> (though the Actors did not keep up their Reputations equal to thoſe of <hi>Athens)</hi> was mark'd out as a Pattern for the Youth of <hi>Rome</hi> to follow in Decency of Dreſs, and Morals. <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, <hi>Cum artifex ejuſmodi ſit, ut ſolus dignus videatur eſſe, qui in ſcena ſpectetur; tum vir ejuſmodi eſt, ut ſolus dignus videatur qui eo non accedat.</hi>—<q>So excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an Artiſt, that he ſeem'd the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to adorn the Stage; and yet, in all other reſpects, ſo complete in every Grace and Virtue, that he ſeem'd the only Perſon that ſhould not take up with ſuch a Profeſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0483300100:35"/>
Moral Virtue, and a decent Behaviour, will gain Eſteem from People of every Rank, will add Weight to the Characters they repreſent, and even may atone for want of Excellency.</p>
            <p>Leſſons for the Stage may be convey'd, in one reſpect, ſtronger than from the Pulpit, if the Audience were attentive as they ſhould be at Church: For a Play well wrote, and well perform'd, where Virtue ſuffers, or meets its juſt Reward, muſt have ſtrong Force upon the Mind, where the Eye is ſuppos'd to view the very Perſons in the real Circumſtances of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What then will add to this Imagination? Why, the Performers to be as blameleſs as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature will allow. I remember a virtuous Actreſs (or one reputed ſo) repeating two Lines in King <hi>Lear,</hi> at her Exit in the Third Act,
<q>
                  <l>Arm'd in my <hi>Virgin Innocence</hi> I'll fly,</l>
                  <l>My Royal Father to relieve, or die,</l>
               </q>
receive a Plaudit from the Audience, more as a Reward for her reputable Character, than, perhaps, her Acting claim'd; when a different <hi>Actreſs</hi> in the ſame Part, more fam'd for her Stage-Performance than the other, at the Words <hi>Virgin Innocence,</hi> has created a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laugh (no Reflection on the Audience, ſince a Theatrical Term), and the Scene of generous Pity and Compaſſion at the Cloſe turn'd to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule. Here the Audience are diſconcerted, and the Reality of the Subject before them loſes much of its Force, with the Imagination
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0483300100:36"/>
debilitated, if not turn'd another Way. On the other hand, indeed, if a Perſon who acts <hi>Iago,</hi> be ſuſpected to wear a Heart that way inclin'd, he appears ſtronger in <hi>that</hi> Character, and meets with an Applauſe that condemns him. We may find, by theſe Examples, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is of ſome Uſe upon the Stage, and would be more ſo, if more practis'd. To give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to an Actor, is a very difficult Taſk; for if much is wanting, it is not worth while to give any. A rough Diamond may be poliſh'd, but few Pebbles are worth cutting. After ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Requiſites for the Stage, bad Action will even cauſe a good Figure to appear aukward; and tho' there may be Rules for Action, yet Nature is the beſt Teacher; and if an Actor of good Underſtanding is truly poſſeſſed with his Character, the true Action will involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily occur. I remember Mrs. <hi>Porter,</hi> to whom Nature had been niggard in Voice and Face, ſo great in many Parts, as Lady <hi>Macbeth, Alicia</hi> in <hi>Jane Shore, Hermione</hi> in the <hi>Diſtreſt Mother,</hi> and many Parts of the Kind, that her juſt Action, Eloquence of Look and Geſture, mov'd Aſtoniſhment! and yet I have heard her declare, ſhe left the Action to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sentiments in the Part ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. I have known ſome tolerable Actors, as to Countenance and Elocution, that have mortify'd both by the Badneſs of Action, more eſpecially the proper Uſe of their Hands: Had they worn each in a Scarf, they had been much more tolerable, as it is the moſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0483300100:37"/>
Part in the Action of the Body, ſo as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſays, <hi>like an ill-ſheath'd Knife, it will moſt hurt its Maſter.</hi> I think <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſays, all the Parts of the Body aſſiſt the Speaker; but the Hands ſpeak without a Tongue, ſupplicate, threaten, call, diſmiſs, provoke, ſhew every Paſſion of the Soul. The Hands are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Language of Mankind, and we need no Grammar but Nature to underſtand it. So by their aukward Uſe upon the Stage, we may turn the Serious into Ridicule. Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> would often regret the want of Opportunity for an Actor to continue in a graceful Attitude, which <hi>Nicolini</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Singer was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly familiar with, between the <hi>Retornels</hi> of a Song, and other Occaſions: Yet when Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> had the leaſt Opportunity, he ſhew'd he only wanted it. I remember in the 5th Act of <hi>Othello,</hi> while he is liſtening to <hi>Emilia</hi>'s ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Deſdemona,</hi> after ſhe is ſuppos'd to be ſtrangled, he ſuited his Attitude and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the Circumſtances of the Scene, that I have not Art to deſcribe, but the treble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Applauſes of the Audience, while he was ſilent, ſpoke ſuch high Approbation, that Miſs <hi>Santlow</hi> (afterwards Mrs. <hi>Booth)</hi> us'd to ſay, <hi>She thought the Audience were pleas'd poor</hi> Deſdemona <hi>was ſtrangled out of the Way</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the various Paſſions of Grief, a manly Sorrow is the moſt difficult to expreſs. And of all the Actors I have ever yet ſeen, I muſt be pardon'd if I give the Preference to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0483300100:38"/>
Mr. <hi>Wilks.</hi> No Heart, that was capable of being touch'd, but muſt have ſympathiz'd at his Manner of ſpeaking one Line in the <hi>Orphan</hi> to <hi>Monimia,</hi> in the Fifth Act.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <l>My fatal Love, alas! has ruin'd thee!</l>
               </q>
And yet I have heard it ſpoke when it has given me no more Concern, than if a Voice had pierced my Ear with
<q>
                  <l>Kettles or Pots to mend! Old Braſs to mend!</l>
               </q>
If moving the Paſſions is a great Art in Acting, I think Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> was Maſter of that Art. There was no avoiding feeling <hi>his</hi> Diſtreſs in another Line, when he performed the Part of the <hi>Royal Merchant</hi> in the <hi>Beggars Buſh,</hi> a Comedy of <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s. The Character is noted for beneficent Charity; and, when his flinty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Creditors had juſt preſs'd him for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Clauſe</hi> his old Beadſman (tho' his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Diſguiſe) comes as if to beg his uſual Charity, when the Merchant replies with ſuch a Tone that ſinks into the Soul:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clauſe,</hi> I pray thee leave me; for, by my Troth, I have nothing now to give thee.</p>
            <p>Compariſon is the true Touchſtone of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and brighten'd Braſs by a falſe Light might be taken for Gold, if not try'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0483300100:39"/>
In the 4th Act of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> when he is told by <hi>Lenox</hi> of the Loſs of his Wife and Children, his Mixture of Sorrow and manly Grief at
<q>
                  <l>He has no Children! Butcher! If he had,</l>
                  <l>The Thought of them would ſure have ſtirr'd Remorſe!</l>
               </q>
drew Tears from almoſt every Eye, when if he had blubber'd like a School-boy whipt, the touching Scene would have rais'd Laughter, in the place of Grief. And yet ſome particular People will not allow Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s Excellence to ſtand in Tragedy. If, indeed, he had attempted the Parts of <hi>Cato, Lear, Macbeth, Henry</hi> the VIIIth, <hi>Melantius,</hi> and a countleſs Catalogue of others in the ſame Claſs, I might have join'd in their Opinion; but while there is a <hi>Juba,</hi> an <hi>Edgar, Macduff, Buckingham,</hi> and <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> in the ſame Plays, I don't deſire to ſee a better Performer in that Caſt of Playing than Mr. <hi>Wilks:</hi> In <hi>Hamlet</hi> he pleas'd all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and if the beſt Judges laugh'd at his Parts in Comedy, I can't conceive they have ſhed more Tears ſince his much-lamented Death, at any of the above-mentioned Plays. I remember a few Years ago a Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe between Two Theatrical Gentlemen upon <hi>this</hi> Stage, concerning the Propriety of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Speech; the one, to enforce his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, told the other, he never heard it ſpoke otherwiſe on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage. <hi>Pho,</hi> reply'd the other Diſputant, <hi>that was the old Way of</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0483300100:40"/>
               <hi>Acting</hi>! A truly great Actor, that ſtood by, reply'd, <hi>Learn the old Way firſt, and when you are perfect, then begin a new one, if you can find it out: Art may invent Faſhions in our Dreſs; but Nature is the ſame as the Habits of the</hi> Turks, <hi>which they have never yet alter'd.</hi> The Cloaths of the firſt <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince is the Model of the Emperor that now reigns, and, as the divine <hi>Pope</hi> paints the unalterable Goddeſs,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Unerring Nature, ſtill divinely bright,</l>
               <l>One clear, unchang'd, and univerſal Light;</l>
               <l>Life, Force, and Beauty, muſt to all impart,</l>
               <l>At once, the Source, and End, and Teſt of Art.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I have known many Actors with excellent Voices; ſo I have often known common Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad-ſingers in the Streets with ſtrong Lungs and Voices; but, for want of a Manner with Judgment, murder an excellent Song, and yet extort Praiſe from their Auditors. A Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelder's Horn will pierce the Ear, and alarm all the Dogs in the Pariſh; but I believe moſt People would rather hear a Trumpet. The Voice, like an Inſtrument of Muſic, muſt be put in Tune, and, if managed by a ſkilful Actor, whoſe Mind feels the Paſſions, will ſend out the proper Tone, when a Bungler in Muſic does but harſhly grate upon the Ear. But who is ignorant of this? If this is the Diſeaſe of the Stage, where is the Remedy? It muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be in the Hands of the Manager, tho' no very eaſy Taſk. The Circumſtances of a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0483300100:41"/>
Theatre very often oblige the Directors to thruſt Perſons into Characters too weak to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Weight of them: Vanity is blended in moſt human Compoſitions, and the Stage is ſeldom free from it; therefore, when an Actor is once in Poſſeſſion of a Part (Male or Female), they think it a very great Hardſhip to give it up to a better Performer. There are a much larger Number of common Soldiers in an Army than commanding Officers, and we have ſome few Inſtances of a Soldier riſing to Preferment by Merit, whilſt others grow grey with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet upon their Shoulders; and yet, at ſome Time or other, a Soldier may do the Duty of a Corporal, if he is indiſpoſed, or out of the Way: But that Exigence does not give him a Title to the Poſt. I remember an Actor was taken into the Theatre in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> for playing the Part of <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> in a private Play; and when Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> was ſtudying the Part, he thought it the greateſt Oppreſſion (as he call'd it) that could be thrown upon him: Nay, after Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> had perform'd the Part, with univerſal Applauſe, ſeveral ſucceſſive Nights, this Perſon ſaid, nay, bound it with an Oath, that <hi>Booth did not know how to ſpeak a ſingle Line:</hi> Yet this Perſon was a Man of Senſe and Learning. But there are more Requiſites to make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Actor: Therefore, as they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways judge candidly for themſelves, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite they ſhould have one of unbyaſs'd and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Knowledge to judge for them. When ſuch Actors above-mention'd take Parts, as they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0483300100:42"/>
thruſt themſelves into for their Benefits, as is too often the Caſe (and I think ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd), it proves, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſays,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—Like a Player,</l>
               <l>Bellowing his Paſſion, till he break the Spring,</l>
               <l>And his rack'd Voice jar to the Audience.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>There are too many Performers, of both Sexes, that are fond of chooſing capital Parts for their Benefits, that ſit upon them
<q>
                  <l>—Like a Giant's Robe</l>
                  <l>Upon a dwarfiſh Thief:</l>
               </q>
And, at the ſame Time, excuſe themſelves from Rehearſals (that ſhould prepare them to act with ſome Decency, at leaſt), to cultivate their Intereſt; and, when they come to perform at Night, only take Shame to themſelves, tho' they oft diſconcert others; and may truly ſay,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Like a dull Actor, now I have forgot</l>

I know an eminent Actor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to dine in a mix'd Company of both Sexes, of Condition: When the Dinner ſeem'd a little tedious, before it made its Entrance, a Gentleman, one of the Invited, ſtarts up, and cry'd, <hi>Zounds, Mr.—, give us the</hi> Ghoſt <hi>in</hi> Hamlet, <hi>by way of Grace</hi>! The Maſter of the Houſe reply'd, there was no Meat he could give him was worth one Speech; beſides, <hi>he did not invite Mr.—to pay for his Dinner that Way. It was only in Retaliation for the Supper he gave him the Night before, on the Stage, where no Cook but himſelf could dreſs ſuch a Diſh of black Broth</hi> (meaning <hi>Othello). So, by your Rule of Courteſy, if I had invited</hi> Fauſan, <hi>I ſhould have deſired him to dance the</hi> Buffoon <hi>before Dinner.</hi> This was the Height of Civility to one, and a ſufficient Rebuke to the other. The Fop (for he was no leſs), to plead his Excuſe, told the Company, he had been many Times with ſeveral Actors, who took as much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſpeak Speeches, as he to hear them; and he did not doubt but they were People of great Judgment; for they generally own'd, other Performers did not act ſo well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Yes,</hi> reply'd the Maſter of the Houſe, <hi>Self-praiſe is always to be believed; yet I have known a Sign-painter criticize upon</hi> Raphael. Wit will be often entertaining, but a ſmall Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one's own (if we had it) is better than a Cart-load of other Peoples: Yet Quotations

            <p>It is ſomething ſurpriſing to me, that where Vice, in every Shape, with Folly, is expos'd daily to their View, Performers on the Stage ſhould have any Faults, or, at leaſt, Art enough to diſguiſe them ſo well, that few ſhould find them out. To hide the Paſſions Nature has ſown in the Seeds of the human Race, will prevent their Growth, and, in Time, deſtroy them. May we not learn Virtue, and avoid Vice, by the inſtructive Leſſons of the Drama?

               <q>The Stage (ſays the <hi>Female Spectator),</hi> by its Inſtitution, is the School of Virtue, and the Scourge of Vice; and when either of theſe noble Purpoſes is defeated, it is no Wonder that Perſons of true Senſe and Honour chooſe to abſent themſelves, and oblige their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to do ſo too.</q> So reaſonable an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, as the Drama in its Purity, muſt be, in ſome ſort, a Promoter to Virtue; therefore every Manager of a Theatre ſhould make it his Study to exhibit no other Pieces but what aim to that End; and, by Degrees, throw off the looſer Drama, and conſtitute, in its place, thoſe that the wiſeſt, and moſt virtuous, need not be aſham'd to partake of the innocent Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I do not pretend to ſet up for a Monitor; but every Stage Performer would find his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in reforming the Stage, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I do not mean this Admonition to any particular Theatre, but all in general, at Home and Abroad; for our Plantations in <hi>America</hi> have been voluntarily viſited by ſome Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; <hi>Jamaica,</hi> in particular. I had an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, from a Gentleman who was poſſeſs'd of a large Eſtate in the Iſland, that a Company, in the Year 1733. came there, and clear'd a large Sum of Money; where they might have made moderate Fortunes, if they had not been too buſy with the Growth of the Country. They receiv'd 370 Piſtoles the firſt Night, to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0483300100:48"/>
the <hi>Beggars Opera;</hi> but within the Space of two Months they bury'd their third <hi>Polly,</hi> and two of their Men. The Gentlemen of the Iſland, for ſome Time, took their Turns upon the Stage, to keep up the Diverſion; but this did not hold long; for, in two Months more, there were but one old Man, a Boy, and a Woman of the Company, left: The reſt died, either with the Country-Diſtemper <note n="s" place="bottom">The Country Diſtempers are, the Dry-gripes, and <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> which generally ends in a Sanguinary Flux: Moſt New-comers, for want of a proper Regimen, fall into it. The Dry-gripes brings a final Diſſolution in two Days, if no Remedy keeps it back. The other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, indeed, is ſlower in its Execution and Cure. Sir <hi>Hans Sloane</hi> tells us, the Badneſs of the Water contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to all theſe Diſtempers, which is brackiſh near the Sea-coaſts: But ſwallowing large Draughts of Rum Punch, with the fatal Dew that falls in the Night, when the Body is careleſly expoſed, heated with drinking, is the chief Cauſe. Place any woollen Garment expos'd to the noxious Vapours of the Night, and it will imbibe double its Weight of Dew before Sun-riſe. Thoſe that eſcape the Seaſoning, as they term it, ſeldom feel the fatal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it afterwards. This is more dangerous on the Sea-coaſts of the Iſland; the mid Parts are much more ſalubrious, both as to Air and Water.</note>, or the common Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Place, the noble Spirit of Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punch, which is generally fatal to New-comers. The ſhatter'd Remains, with upwards of 2000 Piſtoles in Bank, embark'd for <hi>Carolina,</hi> to join another Company at <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> but were caſt away in the Voyage. Had the Company been more bleſt with the Virtue of Sobriety, &amp;c. they might, perhaps, have liv'd to carry home the Liberality of thoſe generous Iſlanders.</p>

Even the Wicked have ſome Regard to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are often aw'd by Perſons that are reputed to wear that amiable Character. Perſons on the Stage, which is too liable to Inſults, eſcape them there, unleſs, as in a Crowd of Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, where a Looker on may meet with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Stroke. But theſe Theatrical Squabbles are too often ungenerous from the Audience, or, I ſhould ſay, from a ſmall Part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for a Dozen, when they are pleas'd to take it into their Heads, ſhall diſturb the Whole, and diſconcert the beſt Actors in the World. Is not this a groſs Affront upon the reſt? What Right have I to rob my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his Money, and Satisfaction? He pays the Price to be entertain'd for two or three Hours, and, perhaps, would be as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a well-acted Play, as a Dinner. Now, if I ſhould come to you, Sir, be you who you will, while you are ſat down to your Meal at a Tavern, turn the Drawers down Stairs, throw your Proviſion about, prevent your eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Dinner with any Satisfaction; I ſhould think you a very good-natur'd Gentleman, if you only thruſt me out of your Room; becauſe I ſhould imagine I deſerv'd worſe Treatment.</p>
            <p>I remember, above twenty Years paſt, I was one of the Audience, at a new Play: Before me ſat a Sea-Officer, with whom I had ſome Acquaintance; on each Hand of him a Couple of Sparks, both prepar'd with their offenſive Inſtruments vulgarly term'd <hi>Cat-calls,</hi> which they were often tuning, before the Play began.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0483300100:50"/>
The Officer did not take any Notice of them till the Curtain drew up; but when they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their Sow-gelder's Muſic (as he unpolitely call'd it), he beg'd they would not prevent his hearing the Actors, tho' they might not care whether they heard, or no; but they took little Notice of his civil Requeſt, which he repeated again and again, to no Purpoſe: But, at laſt, one of them condeſcended to tell him, <hi>If he did not like it, he might let it alone. Why, really,</hi> reply'd the Sailor, <hi>I do not like it, and would have you let your Noiſe alone; I have paid my Money to ſee and hear the Play, and your ridiculous Noiſe not only hinders me, but a great many other People that are here, I believe, with the ſame Deſign: Now if you prevent us, you rob us of our Money, and our Time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat you, as you look like Gentlemen, to behave as ſuch.</hi> One of them ſeem'd mollified, and put his Whiſtle in his Pocket; but the other was incorrigible. The blunt <hi>Tar</hi> made him one Speech more. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I adviſe you, once more, to follow the Example of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and put up your Pipe.</hi> But the <hi>Piper</hi> ſneer'd in his Face, and clap'd his troubleſome Inſtrument to his Mouth, with Cheeks ſwell'd out like a Trumpeter, to give it a redoubled, and louder Noiſe; but, like the broken Crow of a Cock in a Fright, the Squeak was ſtopt in the Middle by a Blow from the Officer, which he gave him with ſo ſtrong a Will, that his Child's Trumpet was ſtruck thro' his Cheek,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0483300100:51"/>
and his Companion led him out to a Surgeon; ſo that we had more Room, and leſs Noiſe; and not one that ſaw or heard the Affair, but what were well pleaſed with his Treatment; and, notwithſtanding his great Bluſtering, he never thought it worth his while to call upon the Officer, tho' he knew where to find him. It is certainly a Mark of Cowardice to inſult in public Company, or ſtrike a Man who has his Hands bound; and yet I have known a poor Actor pelted by Puppies, that would run away at the Sight of a Stage-Foil, that has neither Edge or Point.</p>

Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I believe the firſt that wore the laſt Title. This Theatre was built by his Directions in <hi>Warberg-Street,</hi> where the Company continued to act, till the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Rebellion broke out in the Year 1641 <note n="a" place="bottom">

The Plot is taken from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Saxo Grammaticus.</hi> This Play was the laſt that was performed on the Theatre in <hi>Warberg-ſtreet</hi> before the Rebellion broke out, which was diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Owen O Connolly</hi> but the Night before the Execution, which prevented the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> being ſeiz'd on the 22d of <hi>October</hi> 1641. as intended; but it was too late to give Notice to the reſt of the Kingdom, which felt the fatal Effect of the Rebellion.</note>. The Theatre was then ſhut up, by Order of the Lords Juſtices, ſign'd <hi>William Parſons,</hi> and <hi>John Borlace.</hi> We do not find any mention of a <hi>Theatre</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> till the Year after the Reſtoration 1661. which was built on the Spot where the Theatre now ſtands in <hi>Orange-ſtreet,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Smock-alley;</hi> how it came by the laſt Name, may be eaſily gueſs'd.</p>

but neither of them play'd in <hi>England,</hi> till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Death, which fell out in the Year 1664. in the 31ſt Year of her Age, of the Small-Pox. From this we may gather that ſhe reſided in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince both her Plays were acted in this Kingdom ſome Years before they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Theatre in <hi>Smock-Alley</hi> was ſo badly built, that in the Year 1671. ſome Part of it ſell down, when two were kill'd, and ſeveral ſorely maimed. We can give little Account of the Theatre here from this Time till after the <hi>Revolution;</hi> all that can be given will be noted in the Life of <hi>Joſeph Aſhbury,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Playing was diſcontinued during the Troubles between King <hi>William</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Second; but when quiet Peace was reſtored, the <hi>Theatre</hi> opened again with <hi>Othello</hi> Moor of <hi>Venice;</hi> the Part of <hi>Othello,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> (See more of this in the Memoirs of that excellent Player). This Play was acted by Officers moſtly about the Caſtle, Mr. <hi>Aſhbury Iago</hi> only, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was not form'd till three Months after, when they began again with <hi>Othello,</hi> which was on <hi>March</hi> 23. 1691-2. the Day of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the End of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War.

Diſtinguiſhed Characters in Bills were not in Faſhion, at the Time theſe Plays were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; they were printed in Order according to the Drama as they ſtood, not regarding the Merit of the Actor. As for Example, in <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, Duncan</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> appear'd firſt in the Bill, tho' acted by an inſignificant Perſon; and ſo every other Actor appear'd according to his Dramatic Dignity, all of the ſame-ſiz'd Letter. But latterly, I can aſſure my Readers, I have found it a difficult Taſk to pleaſe ſome <hi>Ladies,</hi> as well as <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> becauſe I could not find Letters large enough to pleaſe them; and ſome were ſo very fond of Elbow-room, that they would have ſhoved every body out but themſelves, as if one Perſon was to do all, and have the Merit of all, like Generals of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſuch a Victory was gained by ſuch a King, and ſuch a Prince, while the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers are forgot.

            <p>In the Year 1732. a Theatrical Booth was erected by Mrs. <hi>Violante</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for Strength and Agility, a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that does not render the Fair-Sex the leaſt more amiable; the Strength of the Limbs, which theſe Sort of Undertakers expoſe, in my Opinion, is ſhockingly indecent; but hers were maſculinely indelicate, and were of a Piece with the Features of her Face. I am informed, the ſhewing her Limbs did not meet with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this Kingdom, as ſhe had found in her elder Siſter, <hi>England;</hi> that Lady's Children delight in ſuch Entertainments: Bull-baiting, Boxing, Bear-garden, and Prize-fighting, will draw to them all Ranks of People, from the Peer to the Pedlar: Our late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gladiator, Mr. <hi>Figg,</hi> of Cutting-ſlaſhing Memory, made much private Emolument by his public Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, more eſpecially in Linen <note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Figg</hi> informed me once, that he had not bought a Shirt for more than twenty Years, but had ſold ſome Dozens. It was his Method, when he fought in his Amphitheatre (his Stage bearing that ſuperb Title); he ſent round to a ſelect Number of his Scholars to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Shirt for the enſuing Combat, and ſeldom failed of half a dozen of ſuperfine Holland from his prime Pupils (moſt of the young Nobility and Gentry made it Part of their Education to march under his warlike Banner). This Champion was generally Conqueror, tho' his Shirt ſeldom failed of gaining a Cut from his Enemy, and ſometimes his Fleſh, tho' I think he never receiv'd any dangerous Wound. Moſt of his Scholars were at every Battle, and were ſure to exult at their great Maſter's Victories, every Perſon ſuppoſing he ſaw the Wounds his Shirt received. Mr. <hi>Figg</hi> took his Opportunity to inform his Lenders of Linen, of the Chaſms their Shirts received, with a Promiſe to ſend them home. <hi>But,</hi> ſaid the ingenious, courageous <hi>Figg, I ſeldom received any other Anſwer, than, Damn you, keep it.</hi> I ſhall not enter into the Merits of this Method in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Linen; but, if it was a Fraud (as he told me), he was never found Guilty.

Here, then, you come, unwilling to be pleas'd,</l>
               <l>Longer than juſt your dazzled Sight is eas'd.</l>
               <l>The Sun, 'tis true, will dim the ſtrongeſt Eye;</l>
               <l>And Darkneſs, only, can new Force ſupply—</l>

               <l>The <hi>Coronation</hi> made ſo great a Noiſe,</l>

               <l>Yet, faith, 'tis odd—But we ſurpriſe you more</l>

               <l>They mourn in Pomp, and ſtarve in pageant State.</l>
               <l>Like petty Kings, who <hi>Rome</hi>'s Subjection own;</l>
               <l>To feed its Pride, they hunger on a Throne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If any here, with indigeſted Rage,</l>
               <l>Will ſpeak malignly of our ſporting Stage,</l>
               <l>As if, in Ridicule of Rites ſo known,</l>
               <l>Sacred to <hi>Britain</hi>'s Fame, and <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Crown,</l>
               <l>We thus our Mockery of State purſue,</l>
               <l>Let others our Deſign with Candour view,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0483300100:75"/>
And own, if any Diſreſpect appears,</l>
               <l>'Tis them we mock; be, then, the Cenſure theirs.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>As the World is fond of Novelty (and this Mock Coronation appearing new), the Stream of Succeſs flowed upon them with a rapid Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſwelled their Pockets till they overflow'd their Banks, and water'd the Fields of many a Publican! Debts were cleared, and every ſingle Perſon might, fearleſs, look at the Dial on the <hi>Tholſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Succeſs went even beyond their Hopes, and <hi>Aungier-ſtreet</hi> ſuffered ſhort Allowance (as they ſay at Sea), becauſe the Current was turn'd another Way: Yet I find, by this Succeſs, all do not think alike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Henry the Eighth,</hi> with the Coronation, in the utmoſt Magnificence, was performed in the Year of his preſent Majeſty's Acceſſion to the Throne, at the Theatre Royal in <hi>Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, London:</hi> The Succeſs <hi>there</hi> was beyond the Bounds of Expectation; it was even added to every Play, as a <hi>Pantomime,</hi> &amp;c. and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, that one Seaſon, 75 Times.</p>
            <p>The Theatre in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</hi> got up a <hi>Mock Coronation,</hi> as a Burleſque upon that in <hi>Drury lane;</hi> but the Audience took a different Turn to that in <hi>Ransford-ſtreet;</hi> for the poor Mock Peers and Magiſtrates were pelted off the Stage, in the utmoſt Contempt, and all their Study and Labour came to nothing.</p>
            <p>However, this <hi>Mock Coronation</hi> fill'd <hi>Ranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſtreet</hi> Theatre, ſeventeen ſucceeding Nights:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0483300100:76"/>
But as Mountain-rivers ſoon overflow, they as ſoon ſink, and reſt in their natural Bed again: <hi>Ransford-ſtreet</hi> was too far out of the Way; therefore the Company, after three Years Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, forſook it. However, I ſhall ſubjoin a Couple of poetical Pieces of Poetry, occaſioned by the above <hi>Prologue:</hi> Wits are a Tribe like <hi>Jews,</hi> and one Production begets another. As every Line of Battle Ship has its own <hi>Chaplain,</hi> ſo every Theatre have their own <hi>Poets;</hi> and ſometimes, like <hi>Ragotin</hi> in <hi>Scarron,</hi> they may be found in itinerant Troops. The opponent Theatre produced one, ſpoken by Mrs. <hi>Bellamy</hi> in Boy's Cloaths, at a Time when an epidemic Cold had reigned greatly in Town.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Dear Ladies, may I periſh, but I'm proud</l>
               <l>To find you all recover'd, and ſo loud.</l>
               <l>Not one ſore Throat amongſt you now remains,</l>
               <l>Of that vile Cold of which the Town complains:</l>
               <l>And, faith, you'll anſwer for me, I'm ſincere,</l>
               <l>When I profeſs I'm glad to ſee you here!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I found a Female Habit would not do,</l>
               <l>And therefore try'd a Pair of Breeches too:</l>
               <l>A ſpruce young Blade, well made, with ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,</l>
               <l>Among you <hi>Belles</hi> may ſpeak with ſome Succeſs—</l>
               <l>And I, who am a Woman—to my Coſt,</l>
               <l>Know, by myſelf, what pleaſe the Ladies moſt—</l>
               <l>In vain we ſtrive our Merit <hi>here</hi> to ſhow,</l>
               <l>For ev'ry Night to <hi>Ransford-ſtreet</hi> you go;</l>
               <l>Where painted Scenes, and tinſell'd taudry Dreſs,</l>
               <l>Are only ſplendid Signs of Emptineſs.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0483300100:77"/>
But this is Scandal; for all <hi>Dublin</hi> knows,</l>
               <l>That Playhouſe deals not over-much in Cloaths.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Two Venders of the ſame Commodity will be a little too apt to depreciate each other's Goods; therefore the Poet drew his Pen in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and furniſhed forth the following <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> ſpoke by Miſs <hi>Mackay,</hi> in the Character of <hi>Lady Townley,</hi> in the <hi>Provok'd Huſband.</hi>

               <l>A Swarm of Duns, each Morn, attend his Door,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Crying out,</hi> Money! Faith we're very poor.</l>
               <l>Why ay! <hi>the 'Squire replies;</hi> but pray have Patience,</l>

               <l>Juſt ſo I've told my Duns, this many a Day,</l>
               <l>They'd all have Money when I got my Play <note n="t" place="bottom">This Play was for Miſs <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Benefit.</note>.</l>
               <l>The other Houſe, we thank their honeſt Care,</l>
               <l>Have, to their Coſt, engag'd the good <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>

               <l>But that is more than they can yet afford.</l>
               <l>'Tis true, alas! we're ſcant in Cloaths, while they</l>

            <p>We may ſee, this laſt Bard did not take the leaſt Advantage of his Antagoniſt: Their Lines were exactly even, and eighteen Thruſts given on each Side, and therefore neither could claim the Conqueſt; tho', like Battles in <hi>Flanders,</hi> each Side claimed the Victory, and each Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral put on the Wreath of Conqueror.</p>
            <p>The Theatre in <hi>Aungier-ſtreet</hi> was built by the voluntary Subſcription of many of the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom: The firſt Stone was laid by the Duke of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> then Lord Lieutenant; but, I think, the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect had more View to the Magnificent, than Theatrical. The Audience Part is ornamented with rich Embelliſhment, that gives it a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb Countenance; but, no Diſparagement to the Architect in other Buildings, this might have been more convenient, with leſs Coſt. But I believe the Contriver had an Eye more to <hi>Ridottos,</hi> than the <hi>Drama:</hi> If ſo, indeed, his Intentions were anſwered; for, in that Shape, it may vie with that in the <hi>Hay-market</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Thruſting my own Opinion, in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, might have the Air of Preſumption, if my Employment and Obſervation had not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0483300100:79"/>
taken up full thirty Years of my Time: In other Buildings I would not pretend to give my Judgment on a Pigeon-houſe, or a Centry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box, or give Directions in erecting a thatched Cabin, or a Turnpike.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0483300100:80"/>
conſidered the Building more for the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Proprietors, I mean for Profit: The <hi>Cavea,</hi> or that Part where the Audience ſit, is much more convenient than that of <hi>Aungier-ſtreet,</hi> and will contain a fifth Part more in Number than the latter, altho' it does not appear ſo to the Eye: On the contrary, the Stage is more cramp'd for want of Room, which might have been otherwiſe at the firſt building.</p>
            <p>When I came firſt from <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1741.

                  <p>THIS Perſon was bred an Attorney in <hi>England;</hi> but, having a Smattering of Wit and Humour, he left the Study of the Law for Parts on the Stage. He ſtrain'd ſorth a Comedy which was acted on the Theatre in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0483300100:95"/>
                     <hi>Smock-alley,</hi> call'd <hi>Love in a Hurry,</hi> but with no Succeſs. He play'd in all the Theatres in <hi>London,</hi> but never continued long in any; his Way of living was peculiar to himſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, reſorting to the principal Cities and Towns in <hi>England</hi> with his <hi>Medley,</hi> as he call'd it, which conſiſted of ſome capital Scenes o Humour out of the moſt celebrated Plays. His Company were generally compos'd of his own Family, himſelf, his Wife and Son; between every Scene, a Song or Dialogue of his own Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, fill'd up the Chinks of the ſlender Meal. He pretended a Right to every Town he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if a Company came to any Place where he exhibited his Compoſitions, he would uſe all his Art to evacuate the Place of theſe Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as he called them. He was never out of his Way; or if he met with a ſightly Houſe when he was Itinerant, he would ſoon find the Name, Title, and Circumſtances of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, curry them over with his humorous Verſe, and by that means get ſomething to bear his Charges to his next Station. His <hi>Finances,</hi> like thoſe of Kingdoms, were ſometimes at the Tide of <hi>Flood,</hi> and as often at low <hi>Ebb.</hi> In one, where his Stream had left the Chanel dry, yet ready to launch out on a trading Voyage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cargo, or Proviſion, he called up his Landlord, to whom there was ſomething due, told him of his Loſſes in his preſent Voyage, and being ſent for to another Place, deſired he would lend him a ſmall Sum upon his <hi>Wardrobe</hi> (which he ſhew'd him in a large Box) ten times
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0483300100:96"/>
the Value of the Debt owing, or the Sum bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd. The honeſt Landlord, ſeeing a proper Security, eaſily comply'd, gave him the Sum demanded, lock'd up the Trunk, put the Key in his Pocket, and retired. But as no Veſſel can make a Voyage without Sails, and other proper Materials, he had contriv'd a falſe Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to this great Box, took out the Stuffing, and by Degrees, ſent off his Wardrobe by his Emiſſaries, unperceiv'd. And that the Weight ſhould not detect him, he filled up the Void with Cabbage-ſtalks, Bricks and Stones cloath'd in Rags to prevent moving, when the Vehicle was to be taken the next Morning into the Landlord's Cuſtody. Every thing ſucceeded to his Wiſh, and away went <hi>Tony,</hi> but far wide of the Place he mentioned to mine Hoſt. A Week was the ſtated Time of Redemption, which the Landlord ſaw elapſe with infinite Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction (for he had a Bill of Sale of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in the Trunk); he open'd it with great Pleaſure; but when he ſaw the fine Lining! he was motionleſs, like a Statue carv'd by a bungling Hand. He had recourſe to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. A Bailiff with proper Directions was ſent to the Place mentioned; but if he had diſcover'd the leaſt Wit in his Anger, he might have thought <hi>Tony</hi> knew better than to tell him Truth. I only mention this little Story, to let the Reader know the Shifts the <hi>Itinerant</hi> Gentry are ſometimes put to. For <hi>Tony,</hi> when his <hi>Finances</hi> were in Order, and cur'd of the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, honeſtly paid him. I have had this Tale
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0483300100:97"/>
both from <hi>Tony</hi> and the Landlord, who then kept the <hi>Black-Boy</hi> Inn at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Tony</hi> by chance ever came to a Town where a Company of <hi>Showmen</hi> (as People oft call them) had got in before him, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declar'd War with them; and his general Conditions of Peace were, that they ſhould act a Play for his Benefit, that he might leave the Siege, and march with his ſmall Troop to ſome other Place. And as he was a Perſon of Humour, and a proper Aſſurance, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, like a Cat, ſkimm'd off the fat Cream, and left the lean Milk to thoſe that ſtay'd behind. I believe he is Travelling ſtill, and is as well known in every Town, as the Poſt-Horſe that carries the Mail. He ſhall make his <hi>Exit</hi> with the two following Lines.</p>

                  <p>THIS excellent Tragedian was Son to <hi>John Booth,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of the County Palatine of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> a Branch of the <hi>Warrington</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He was born in the Year 1681. in that County; but ſoon after his Birth his Father and Family removed to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and, at that celebrated School, the Son received his Education, under the Correction (as he call'd it) of the great Dr. <hi>Buſby</hi> and Dr. <hi>Knipe.</hi> He
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0483300100:98"/>
inform'd me, the firſt Look he caſt towards the Theatre, was from the Applauſe he received in performing in the <hi>Andria</hi> of <hi>Terence</hi> in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter-School,</hi> which perverted his Thoughts from the Pulpit, for which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intended him. At Seventeen he was choſe out for the Univerſity, and had Orders to prepare for his Journey; but his Inclinations prevented the Deſigns of his Friends.</p>
                  <p>He firſt apply'd to Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> then to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Two celebrated Actors; but they decently refus'd him for Fear of the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Family: But this did not prevent his purſuing the Point in View; therefore he reſolv'd for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſafely arrived in <hi>June</hi> 1698. His firſt Rudiments Mr. <hi>Aſhbury</hi> taught him, and his firſt Appearance was in the Part of <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> where he acquitted himſelf ſo well to a crouded Audience, that Mr. <hi>Aſhbury</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him with a Preſent of Five Guineas, which was the more acceptable as his laſt Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was reduced to Braſs (as he inform'd me). But an odd Accident fell out upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It being very warm Weather, in his laſt Scene of the Play, as he waited to go on, he inadvertently wiped his Face, that, when he enter'd, he had the Appearance of a Chimney-Sweeper (his own Words). At his Entrance, he was ſurpris'd at the Variety of Noiſes he heard in the Audience (for he knew not what he had done), that a little confounded him, till he received an extraordinary Clap of Applauſe, which ſettled his Mind. The Play was deſir'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0483300100:99"/>
for the next Night of Acting, when an Actreſs fitted a Crape to his Face, with an Opening proper for the Mouth, and ſhap'd in Form for the Noſe; but, in the firſt Scene, one Part of the Crape ſlip'd off: <hi>And Zounds</hi>! ſaid he (he was a little apt to ſwear), <hi>I look'd like a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie! When I came off, they Lamp-black'd me for the reſt of the Night</hi> 
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">The Compoſition for blackening the Face are Ivory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black and Pomatum, which is, with ſome Pains, clean'd with freſh Butter.</note>, <hi>that I was flayed before it could be got off again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He remained here near Two Years, and, in that Time, by Letters, reconciled himſelf to his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and return'd with great Theatrical Improvement, where he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſtept to Perfection. In 1704. he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Daughter of Sir <hi>Wm. Barkham,</hi> Bart. an antient Family in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who died without Iſſue in the Year 1711. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in the <hi>Diſtreſt Mother</hi> plac'd him in the Seat of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> fix'd him there; and, to reward his Merit, he was join'd in the Patent, tho' great Intereſt was made againſt him by the other <hi>Patentees;</hi> who, to prevent his ſoliciting his Patrons at Court, then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> gave out Plays every Night, where Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> had a principal Part. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Step, he had a Chariot and Six of a Nobleman's waiting for him at the End of every Play, that whipt him the Twenty Miles in three Hours, and brought him back to the Buſineſs of the Theatre the next Night.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0483300100:100"/>
He told me, not one Nobleman in the Kingdom had ſo many Sets of Horſes at Command as he had at that Time, having no leſs than Eight; the firſt Set carrying him to <hi>Hounſlow</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> Ten Miles; and the next Set ready waiting with another Chariot to carry him to <hi>Windſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had a vaſt Fund of Underſtanding as well as Good-nature, and a perſuaſive Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even in common Diſcourſe, that would even compel you to believe him againſt your Judgment of Things. Notwithſtanding his Exuberance of Fancy, he was untainted in his Morals. In his younger Years he admir'd none of the Heathen Deities ſo much as <hi>Jolly Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus;</hi> to him he was very devout; yet, if he drank ever ſo deep, it never marr'd his Study, or his Stomach. But, immediately after his Marriage with Miſs <hi>Santlow,</hi> whoſe wiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, Beauty, and winning Behaviour, ſo wrought upon him, that Home, and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, were his chief Happineſs, he intirely contemn'd the Folly of Drinking out of Seaſon, and from one Extreme fell, I think, into the other too ſuddenly; for his Appetite for Food had no Abatement. I have often known Mrs. <hi>Booth,</hi> out of extreme Tenderneſs to him, order the Table to be remov'd, for fear of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging his Stomach.</p>
                  <p>His profound Learning was extraordinary, ſince he left School at Seventeen, took to the Stage at Eighteen, and, by his own Confeſſion, that the Buſineſs of the Stage, joined with his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0483300100:101"/>
Devotion to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> had taken up moſt of his Time ſince, yet I have ſeen him take a Claſſic, and render it in ſuch elegant <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that no Tranſlator would hardly excel. I will ſet down his Character from a Paper call'd the <hi>Prompter,</hi> by <hi>Aaron Hill,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whoſe Writings will be a living Monument of his own Merit.</p>
                  <q>Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> was a Man of a ſtrong, clear, and lively Imagination. His Converſation was lively and inſtructive: He had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a finiſh'd Education to improve and illuſtrate the bountiful Gifts of Nature. Two Advantages diſtinguiſhed him in the ſtrongeſt Light, from the reſt of the Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He had Learning to underſtand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly whatever it was his Part to ſpeak, and Judgment to know how far it agreed or diſagreed with his Character. Hence aroſe a peculiar Grace, which was viſible to every Spectator, tho' few were at the Pains of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining into the Cauſe of their Pleaſure. He could ſoften, or ſlide over, with a kind of elegant Negligence, the Improprieties in a Part he acted; while, on the contrary, he would dwell with Energy upon the Beauties, as if he exerted a latent Spirit, which had been kept back for ſuch an Occaſion, that he might alarm, waken, and tranſport, in thoſe Places only, where the Dignity of his own good Senſe could be ſupported with that of his Author. A little Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this remarkable Quality, will teach us to account for that manifeſt Languor which has
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0483300100:102"/>
ſometimes been obſerved in his Action; and which was generally, tho', I think, falſly, imputed to the Indolence of his Temper. For the ſame Reaſon, tho' in the cuſtomary Round of his Buſineſs he would condeſcend to ſome Parts in Comedy, he ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in any of them with much Advantage to his Character. The Paſſions which he found in Comedy, were not ſtrong enough to excite his Fire; and what ſeem'd Want of Qualification, was only Abſence of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. He had a Talent of diſcovering the Paſſions where they lay hid in ſome ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Parts by the injudicious Practice of other Actors; when he had diſcover'd, he ſoon grew able to expreſs them: And his Secret for attaining this great Leſſon of the Theatre, was an Adaption of his Looks to his Voice, by which artful Imitation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Variations in the Sound of his Words gave Propriety to every Change in his Countenance: So that it was <hi>Booth</hi>'s Excellence to be heard and ſeen the ſame, whether as the pleas'd, the griev'd, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying, the reproachful, or the angry. His Geſture, or, as it is commonly call'd, his Action, was but the Reſult and neceſſary Conſequence of his Dominion over his Voice and Countenance; for having, by a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Two ſuch Cauſes, impreſſed his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with ſuch a Stamp and Spirit of Paſſion, his Nerves obey'd the Impulſe by a kind of natural Dependency, or relaxed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0483300100:103"/>
or braced ſucceſſively into all that fine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiveneſs with which he painted what he ſpoke without Reſtraint, or Affectation.</q>
                  <p>As a Proof of Mr. <hi>Booth</hi>'s Learning, I am deſired to inſert the <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcription wrote by him on the Death of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">This Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> was zealouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd to the Intereſt of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, and ſerved in his Army as a Volunteer, with Two Servants. After the Abdication, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> return'd to the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, by the Perſuaſion of many Friends, and the Deſire of the Town, who admired his Performance. The firſt Character he choſe to appear in was that of <hi>Wilmore</hi> in the <hi>Rover,</hi> his original Part in that Comedy; but, being informed that he ſhould be maltreated on account of his Principles, he gave Orders for the Curtain to drop, if any Diſturbance ſhould come from the Audience. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Play began in the utmoſt Tranquillity; but when Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> entered in the Firſt Act, the Storm began with the uſual Noiſe upon ſuch Occaſions (an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar not unknown to all Frequenters of Theatres, and by Time mightily improved by a particular Set that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that agreeable Harmony, as pleaſing to the Ear, as a Sow-gelder's Horn, that ſets all the Village Curs to imitate the Sound); Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> gave the Signal, the Curtain dropp'd, and the Audience diſmiſs'd. No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions could prevail upon him to appear on the Stage again, till that great Poet, Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> had wrote his Comedy of <hi>Love for Love,</hi> which was in the Year 1695. more than three Years void from the above Accident. This celebrated Author prevailed upon ſeveral Perſons of the Firſt Rank to move Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to appear in the Character of <hi>Scandal</hi> in that excellent Comedy: But he yielded more to the Perſuaſions of his ſincere Friends, Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Barry,</hi> and accepted the Part; and his inimitable Performance added one Grace to the Play. He took his Station in many Plays afterwards, for, I think, three Years. He died of a Cold, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino'd by a violent Fit of the Cramp; for when he was firſt ſeiz'd, he threw himſelf out of Bed, and remained ſo long before the Cramp left him (in that naked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition), that a Cold fell upon his Lungs, a Fever enſu'd, and Death releas'd him in three Days after.</note>the <hi>Actor,</hi>

                  <p>HE was born in this Kingdom in the Year 1666. and play'd on the <hi>Iriſh Theatre</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years. He had a loud ſtrong Voice, which gave him the Title of an Actor of Spirit. Through the Intereſt of the late Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

he got into the Revenue in <hi>London.</hi> He was fiery to a Fault, and paſſionate to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which drew on his own Death, by the unwilling Hands of Mr. <hi>Quin.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bowen</hi> was too tenacious, and could not brook being told, that the late <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> excell'd in the Part of <hi>Jacomo</hi> in the <hi>Libertine:</hi> Tho' it was given againſt him by the whole Company. He immediately parted, ſent to Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> (in the Name of a Gentleman) to a neighbouring Tavern; when he enter'd, <hi>Bowen</hi> ſhut the Door, clapt his Back againſt it, and drew his Sword. Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> mildly expoſtulated with him, but all to no Purpoſe. He threaten'd to pin him to the Wainſcot, if he did not draw that Moment; which he did to defend his own Life, with an Intention to diſarm him: But <hi>Bowen</hi> preſſed ſo furiouſly upon him, that he receiv'd the Wound which occaſion'd his Death three Days after. However, when the Loſs of Blood had weakened his Rage, he confeſs'd his own Folly and Madneſs had juſtly drawn on his own Misfortune; and, at the Tryal, Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> was honourably acquitted. Mr. <hi>Bowen</hi> had ſeveral Children by his Wife, and a Boy illegitimate, who, tho' he bore his Name, had none of his Care; and therefore lived a diſſolute Life, without the leaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement from Education, and juſtly gain'd the Nick-name of <hi>Rugged-and-Tough.</hi> One Day a Clergyman in <hi>St. Clement Danes</hi> (a Church in the <hi>Strand)</hi> was catechizing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Pariſh, where <hi>Rugged-and-Tough</hi>

                  <p>THIS Gentleman was born of a good Family in the County of <hi>Corke.</hi> He was bred to the Law, but his ſtronger Genius led him to the Drama, where he has prov'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one of its favourite Children. I think his

firſt Commencement in the Drama was in <hi>Violante</hi>'s Booth (as it was then call'd) in <hi>George's-Lane.</hi> He may be well eſteem'd an excellent Comic Actor, of infinite Humour; a much-deſir'd pleaſing Companion, and (what is not always to be met with) a Perſon of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.

                     <head>To Mr. <hi>Spranger Barry,</hi> from a Friend in the Country.</head>
                     <p>AS I lately heard you were determin'd for the Stage, my Affection for your Perſon, and Concern for your Misfortunes, gave Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſome Reflections which may, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, be of Uſe to you in this new Scene of Life. In the Time of <hi>Athenian</hi> Elegance, when Learning was in Taſte, when Liberty was the Bleſſing of the Public, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Arts; which Excellence, alone, found Honour, Capacity, Employment, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Rewards; the Stage grew ſuddenly from its Infancy to Maturity, and, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged, became itſelf the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of thoſe Talents and Geniuſes with which it was ſupply'd. It was there that each Spectator was taught his particular Conduct, by ſeeing his own Repreſentation in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Picture of Life, where the Lights were thrown alone upon Virtue, and the Shades upon Vice; where Great and Eminent, of every Age, were ſet up for Imitation; where every noble, tender, and exalted Sentiment, was recorded, and daily inculcated; where Purity was invited, Obſcenity exiled; and where the Heart was attached to Virtue, by affectingly walking through all its Scenes of Misfortunes; and, laſtly, exulting in its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reward. No Inſtitution, leſs than divine, could ever be of equal Efficacy, or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0483300100:113"/>
For when Inſtruction becomes our Entertainment, then, only, it is, that Vice grows deteſtable, and Virtue delightful, from the Pleaſure it brings: And hence were the Sentiments of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Vulgar ſo exalted, that an immoral Expreſſion, tho' naturally introduced in an immoral Character, has been hiſs'd off the Stage. Shall we think, then, that where the Doctrine was ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the Preaching was diſhonourable? No, ſure. To be an Actor, then, was not to be a <hi>Mimic;</hi> no Trick of Geſture, or Tone of Voice, could avail: Thoſe of Diſtinction were to be, by Nature, the very Perſons they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; they were to have the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Soul, the ſame Delicacy of Thought, the ſame Morality of Life, the ſame Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Heart, and Sweetneſs of Affections, that could at once conſtitute the Patriot, the Hero, the Lover, and the Friend. The Words only belonged to the Author, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were, by Nature, their own; and hence flowed that Aptneſs of Attitude, that Eaſe in Elocution, that expreſſive Look, that eloquent Silence, that Freedom of Action, and that Harmony of the Whole, which at once exalted, melted, and ſubdued a mighty Nation to Elegance and Virtue. Where ſuch an Actor was found, he was juſtly eſteem'd a Bleſſing to the Community. As his Talents were the Admiration, ſo his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was the Delight, of all People; in his Life he was honoured, and his Poſterity provided
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0483300100:114"/>
for. You will now, perhaps, be tempted to wiſh, that this was the Stage of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> but Nature and Mankind are always the ſame; and even on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theatre I have known ſome, who gain'd more Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Reſpect as Actors, than they deſerv'd as Men: But if the Members of your new Province have brought a Scandal on their Profeſſion, let it be your Study to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve it. If I have any Judgment, you are qualified to excel in this Way; nor would I have you imagine, that any will ſhun you in Private, merely becauſe you give them Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Entertainment in Public. Let your Heart be the true Model of whatever is great, or good, in the Characters you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent: Take Inſtruction with Pleaſure, and Applauſe with Humility; and then fear not to be received as the Man of Worth, and the Gentleman you have hitherto been eſteemed. I am, &amp;c.</p>

                              <head>A ſmall Animadverſion on a late Affair in the Playhouſe.</head>
                              <p>I Went, the other Night, to the Playhouſe, in full Expectation of ſeeing the <hi>Rehearſal</hi> perform'd in as high a Manner as was poſſible: But, to my great Surprize, the Performance was interrupted, and the Audience diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by a Concert of moſt unmuſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, in the Gallery. The Cauſe of this Noiſe and Hurly-burly was ſoon found to be a private Diſpute between ſomebody in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0483300100:116"/>
Gallery and <hi>Bardin</hi> the Player, which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute might (with the Conſent of the whole Theatre) have ſubſiſted ſeven Years, ſo it had not offended a numerous and polite Audience.</p>
                              <p>—If a Player, in his private Capacity, offends me, will this warrant my offending a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand People at once? Should I have a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at Law, or Play with Mr. <hi>G—ck,</hi> muſt the whole Town, for this Reaſon, loſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the rareſt King <hi>Lear</hi> and <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> that ever were ſeen in this, or any other Country? If <hi>B—n</hi> had done any unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and injurious Thing to a Gentleman, <hi>B—n</hi> ſhould have made proper and ample Satisfaction, in his private Capacity, for the Offence. The Audience had no Right in, nor Care for <hi>B—n,</hi> but they certainly have for Prince <hi>Volſcius;</hi> he was their Player; they had paid for him: The Prince had managed his Horſe with wondrous Dexterity, and had an undoubted Right to have ridden him to the Battle. There is nothing more miſtaken than that Right which ſome People imagine they have in Theatres, and other publick Places; for, in Truth, their Right conſiſts only in decently partaking of the Entertainment, and, where they think it deſerves it, giving a proper and timely Applauſe. It is the ſame Right that a Man has in a Ferry-boat, that is (if he behaves himſelf properly), to be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pleaſantly landed on the oppoſite Shore; but, if he diſturbs the Paſſage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers the Boat, the Ferryman and Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0483300100:117"/>
will certainly join, and throw him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. A ſurly Swain at a Horſe-race, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying he had a Right to any Part of the Sod, would needs ride directly in the Courſe; the firſt of the Racers threw him and his Horſe twenty Yards on the Ground; and better had it been if he had died with his Horſe on the Spot; for he received a Laſh from every Whip in the Field. Every Gentleman, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly habited, has a Right to go to Court; but if a Perſon, having a Pique to a Battle-ax, ſhould breed an Uproar in the Levee-room, he would certainly have a Halberd in his Guts, or be ſent to the Black Hole. There can be no Excuſe for doing an Injury to a Multitude.</p>
                              <p>I have often dined at a Two-diſh Ordinary, where I had a Right to partake of each; but if I ſhould have taken it into my Head to have thrown one Diſh at the Waiter, and kick'd the other about the Floor, I do verily believe I ſhould have been kick'd down Stairs. If a Gentleman (Heaven defend us!) ſhould have a Quarrel on his Hands with a Porter, the Gentleman certainly has a Right to do himſelf Juſtice; but I ſhould think it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what untimely, if he ſhould knock the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down when he had a Dozen of my Wine on his Back. <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> who well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Decorum of Theatres, gives ſtrong Advice for proper Behaviour: He ſpeaks it to the Players, but he meant it to the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators likewiſe, tho', in his Modeſty, he held
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0483300100:118"/>
it not meet ſo to ſet it down. He directs them to be extremely careful not to create the leaſt Noiſe or Diſturbance in the Houſe when the Play ſhould be duly attended to. He concludes, that, to diſturb the Houſe, <hi>is villainous, and betrays a pitiful Ambition in the Fool that does it.</hi>

                  <head>Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER.</head>
                  <p>THIS Gentleman came into the World on the Day of the great and deſtructive Storm in 1703. whoſe Rage rang'd over the greateſt Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> but, I think, moſt fatal to <hi>England.</hi> He is Son to <hi>Colley Cibber,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that excellent Comedian, the preſent Poet Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat, whoſe dramatic Works are ſo well known.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Theophilus Cibber</hi> receiv'd his Education at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> School: His ſtrong Genius for the <hi>Theatre</hi> brought him early upon the Stage, where he has appear'd in full Luſtre in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Branches of Comedy; and tho' he has
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0483300100:126"/>
perform'd ſeveral Parts in Tragedy with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in my Imagination the <hi>Sock</hi> ſits eaſier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him than the <hi>Buſkin.</hi> His firſt Wife, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Account of Mrs. <hi>Clive,</hi> was Miſs <hi>Johnſon,</hi> by whom he had two Daughters. The eldeſt, I am inform'd, has appear'd on the Stage with great Proſpect of excelling, firſt in the Part of <hi>Juliet,</hi> in <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet,</hi> by <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi> His ſecond Wife, Miſs <hi>Arne</hi> (by whom he has no living Iſſue), is arriv'd at the higheſt Pitch of Excellence in the amiable, ſoft, and tender.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Theophilus Cibber</hi> has appear'd twice as a dramatic Author; <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, <hi>Henry the Sixth,</hi> alter'd from <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> which was play'd in the Summer-ſeaſon of 1721. without any Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks laying hold of it: His ſecond Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Drama was, a Comedy call'd <hi>The Lover;</hi> but as the Criticks were always ready arm'd to attack the Father, they drew their Indignation on the Son, with the falſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that the Father was the conceal'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But I am poſitively convinced to the contrary; for that Gentleman to me refus'd the Sight of it before it appear'd on the Stage, for the very Reaſons, he ſuſpected, that fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. However, he wrote an <hi>Epilogue,</hi> that was ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Theophilus</hi> and his Wife, that took away the Sting of the Revelrout, and the Play was perform'd ſix Nights in the Year 1731. The <hi>Epilogue,</hi> for its Singularity, I ſhall inſert here.</p>

                  <p>THIS celebrated natural Actreſs was the Daughter of Mr. <hi>William Raftor,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman born in the City of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Father of her Father was poſſeſſed of a conſiderable Paternal Eſtate in the County where he was born; but the Parent of our Actreſs being unhappily attach'd to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate King <hi>James</hi> the Second, the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution gave it, among many others, to the Crown. Mr. <hi>James Raftor,</hi> her Brother, went over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſome Years ago, in order to ſolicit for his Grandfather's Fortune; but did not meet with Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>William Raftor,</hi> the Father, was bred to the Law; however, when King <hi>James</hi> was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he enter'd into his Service; and, after the deciſive Battle of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> in the Year 1690. he follow'd his Maſter's Fortune, and, by his Merit, obtain'd a Captain's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the Service of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth; but, gaining a Pardon, with many other Gentlemen in his Condition, he came to <hi>England,</hi> where he married Mrs. <hi>Daniel,</hi> Daughter to an eminent Citizen on <hi>Fiſhſtreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> with whom he had a handſome Fortune: By her he had a numerous Iſſue.</p>

Miſs <hi>Catharine</hi> was born in the Year 1711. She had an early Genius for the Stage; for ſhe told me, when ſhe was about twelve Years old, Miſs <hi>Johnſon</hi> (afterwards the firſt Wife of Mr. <hi>Theo. Cibber,</hi> another riſing Genius, if Death had not overtaken her in her Prime of Youth) and ſhe, uſed to tag after the celebrated Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> (her own Words) whenever they ſaw him in the Streets, and gape at him as a Wonder.</p>
                  <p>Miſs <hi>Raftor</hi> had a facetious Turn of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and infinite Spirits, with a Voice and Manner in finging Songs of Pleaſantry peculiar to herſelf. Thoſe Talents Mr. <hi>Theo. Cibber</hi> and I (we all at that Time living together in one Houſe) thought a ſufficient Paſport to the <hi>Theatre.</hi> We recommended her to the <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat,</hi> whoſe infallible Judgment ſoon found out her Excellencies; and the Moment he heard her ſing, put her down in the Liſt of Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers at twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week. But never any Perſon of her Age flew to Perfection with ſuch Rapidity; and the old diſcerning Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers always diſtinguiſh'd Merit by Reward. Her firſt Appearance was in the Play of <hi>Mith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> in <hi>Iſmenes</hi> the Page to <hi>Ziphares,</hi> in Boy's Cloaths, where a Song pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Circumſtances of the Scene was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, which ſhe performed with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Applauſe. But after this, like a Bullet in the Air, there was no diſtinguiſhing the Track, till it came to its utmoſt Execution.</p>

Plays together: when we were preparing to act <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> or, <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s <hi>Overthrow,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had wrote out my Part of <hi>Maſſiva,</hi> I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him the Book of the Play to ſtudy the Part of King <hi>Maſiniſſa;</hi> I found him finiſhing a Velvet Cuſhion, and gave him the Book; but alas! before he could ſecrete it, his Maſter (a hot voluble <hi>Frenchman)</hi> came in upon us, and the Book was thruſt under the Velvet of the Cuſhion.

                  <p>WAS born in <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1692.</p>
                  <p>He had a ſmall Poſt in the Wardrobe under his Grace the Duke of <hi>Montague;</hi> but hearing the Succeſs of his elder Brother in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he left his Poſt, to follow the Call he had to the Stage. By his Theatrical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in <hi>England,</hi> he ſet out in <hi>Ireland</hi> with Succeſs, improving his Talents ſo well, that he gave the utmoſt Satisfaction in many capital Parts. His Grace the Duke of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> when Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> gave him a Poſt in the Revenue, which he faithfully executed, and enjoy'd to his Death.</p>
                  <p>He was in a languiſhing State of Health near two Years; but the laſt Stroke he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where Part of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were playing during the Time of the Camp being at <hi>Bennet's-Bridge;</hi> he was carried back to his Houſe in <hi>Drumcondra-lane,</hi> where, after a few Days Struggle, Death overcame him in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1746. in the 53d Year of his Age, of a <hi>Polypus</hi>

This Diſtemper is ſometimes found in the thick Membrane of the Brain, which proves fatal. This Diſeaſe often ſeizes the Noſe, and other hollow Parts of the Body, fixing its Fibres like the Root of a Plant, which muſt be cut off, and intirely eradicated, or it will grow again.</p>

                  <head>Mr. RALPH ELRINGTON,</head>
                  <p>IS the younger Brother of the late eminent Player <hi>Thomas Elrington,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> born in <hi>England,</hi> and came early upon the Stage, tho' without any Countenance (as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd) from his Friends and Relations. Since his elder Brother's Death he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken many of his Parts, which he copies as near as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>He was admired ſome Years ago as a good executing <hi>Harlequin,</hi> Agility and Strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two main Ingredients in the Compoſition of that motly Gentleman, where <hi>Heels</hi> are of more Uſe than the <hi>Head.</hi> In one of his Feats of Activity he was much hurt, and was in ſome Danger of breaking his Neck to pleaſe the Spectators, the Ears having little to do in ſuch Entertainments; yet this unlucky Spring met with univerſal Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>I remember a Tumbler in the <hi>Hay-market</hi> Theatre in <hi>London</hi> by ſuch an Accident beat the Breath out of his Body, which raiſed ſuch vociferous Applauſe, that laſted longer than the vent'rous Man's Life, for he never breathed more. Indeed his Wife had this Comfort,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0483300100:146"/>
when the Truth was known, Pity ſucceeded to the Roar of Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>Another Accident like this, fell out in Dr. <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> a Pantomime Entertainment in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-Inn-Fields</hi> Theatre, where a Machine in the Working broke, threw the mock <hi>Pierrot</hi> down headlong with ſuch Force, that the poor Man broke a Plank on the Stage with his Fall, and expired: Another was ſo ſorely maimed, that he did not ſurvive many Days; and a third, one of the ſofter Sex, broke her Thigh. But to prevent ſuch Accidents for the future, thoſe Perſons are repreſented by inanimate Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, ſo that if they break a Neck, a Leg, or an Arm, there needs no Surgeon.</p>
                  <p>Another Accident of the ſame Kind hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Smock-alley,</hi> which gave me much Concern, as having a Hand in the Contrivance. The late Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> being to fly on the Back of a Witch, in the <hi>Lancaſhire Witches,</hi> thro' the Ignorance of the Workers in the Machine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Fly broke, and they both fell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but thro' Providence they neither of them were much hurt; and ſuch Care was taken afterwards, that no Accident of that Kind <hi>could</hi> happen.</p>

                     <l>When Danger's fled, it dwells upon the Mind,</l>

                  <head>Mr. RICHARD ESTCOURT.</head>
                  <p>THIS excellent Comedian was born at <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> in the County of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in the Year 1668. where he received his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the <hi>Latin</hi> School of that Town. He had an early Deſire for the Stage; for, in the 15th Year of his Age, he ſtole from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe with a Country Company, and at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> for fear of being known, ſet out with the Part of <hi>Roxana,</hi> in Woman's Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel (in <hi>Alexander the Great);</hi> but his Father, having Notice of it, ſent to ſecure the Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, who made his Eſcape in a Suit of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Cloaths that he borrowed of one of the Itinerant Ladies, and trudg'd it to <hi>Chipping-Norton,</hi> a Corporation-town in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> twenty-five long Miles in one Day. When he came to the Inn, Beds were ſcarce, and he was obliged to take up with that of the Daughter's behind the Bar: The young Woman, going to Bed, found the wearied Traveller in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Sleep; but, obſerving the Shirt inſtead of a Shift, ſhe began to ſuſpect her deſign'd Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow; and, ſtooping to look on the Dreſs that lay upon the Ground, ſhe ſaw a Pair of Man's Shoes under the Bed, that convinced her ſhe might have been in an odd Situation, if ſhe had gone to Bed in the Dark. She, upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, inſtantly called in the People of the Houſe, and waked our drowſy Traveller. The
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0483300100:148"/>
Landlord had deſigned to carry him decently to the Horſe-pond, till <hi>Dick</hi> made a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the whole Affair. By Accident, a Perſon of the Town of <hi>Tewksbury</hi> put up at the ſaid Inn that Night, who knew our young diſguiſed Wanderer; and that Knowlege ſigned his Pardon. In two Days afterwards his Cloaths were brought him from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Meſſenger from his Father, who led him the Road home again.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, the Father went with him to <hi>London,</hi> where he bound him faſt to an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary in <hi>Hatton-garden.</hi> He was too impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to wait ſo long a Time for Liberty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtretched his Bonds till they broke, and, after an <hi>itinerant</hi> Life two Years in <hi>England,</hi> he went to try his Fortune in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he ſhone in an exalted theatrical Sphere for ſome Years, when he returned to <hi>London;</hi> where, by his Wit, and mimic Humour, his Converſation was taken up by Perſons of the higheſt Rank, and Parts.</p>
                  <p>He was made Providore of the <hi>Beef-Stake-Club,</hi> and, for a Mark of Diſtinction, wore their Badge, which was a ſmall Gridiron of Gold, hung about his Neck with a green ſilk Ribband. This Club was compos'd of the chief Wits and great Men of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eſtcourt</hi> was the original Serjeant <hi>Kite,</hi> and every Night of Performance entertained the Audience with Variety of little Catches, and Flights of Humour, that pleaſed all but his <hi>Critics.</hi> He was a great Favourite with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0483300100:149"/>
the late Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> whoſe juſt Fame he celebrated in ſeveral out-of-the way witty Ballads. He was Author of a Comedy called <hi>The Wife's Excuſe; or, Cuckolds make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> and acted at the Theatre-Royal in the Year 1706. but, as I have been informed, with moderate Succeſs. Another little Piece was produced by him, call'd <hi>Prunella,</hi> a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque upon the <hi>Italian Operas,</hi> then ſtole into Faſhion, too much ſupported by the excellent Voice and Judgment of Mrs. <hi>Tofts:</hi> But ſuch an odd Medley—Mrs. <hi>Tofts,</hi> a mere <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi> in the Part of <hi>Camilla,</hi> courted by <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colini</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> without underſtanding one ſingle Syllable each other <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>ſung;</hi> and, on the other Hand, <hi>Valentini</hi> courting amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, in the ſame Language, a <hi>Dutchwoman,</hi> that committed Murder on our good old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> with as little Underſtanding as a <hi>Parrot:</hi> Though it was reported a Lady, of ſome Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, fell deſperately in Love with <hi>Nicolini;</hi> which occaſioned the following Lines, that were pinn'd to <hi>Nicolini</hi>'s Coat in a Chocolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>

                  <p>This celebrated Comedian paid his Debt to Nature in the Year 1733. after leaving the Stage ſome Years. Sir <hi>Richard Steele</hi> gives him this Character, in his Lucubrations: "An excellent Companion, one who was perfectly Maſter of well-turned Compliments, as well as ſmart Repartees; which ſhews a ready Wit <note n="w" place="bottom">

                        <p>This Gentleman was born in the Year 1666. and died in the Year 1739. I have often heard him ſay, he never remember'd that any Indiſpoſition retarded his coming to the Theatre during his long Courſe of Life; and this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was made not a Month before he died.

In the laſt Year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> the Company of <hi>Dublin</hi> went down, in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Seaſon, to play at <hi>Corke:</hi> One Evening Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> was invited, by ſome Officers of a Regiment then on Duty in that City, to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern: Many Healths were propos'd, and went round, without Reluctance; when it came to Mr. <hi>Evans</hi>'s Turn, he propoſed the Health of her Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> which ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted one of the Company (tho' cloath'd in the Livery of his Royal Miſtreſs), that he ran down Stairs, and ſent up a Drawer to whiſper Mr. <hi>Evans;</hi> who immediately put on his Sword, and went after him, without taking the leaſt Notice to the Company. He found his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt in a Room in the Paſſage of the Tavern, with the Door half open, who courageouſly made a Thruſt at Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> which he put by with his left Hand; at this, Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> drew, thruſt the Door wide open, enter'd, and ſoon drove his Oppoſer out to the Paſſage, where he diſarmed the doughty Hero, before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany above Stairs knew any thing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The reſt of the military Gentlemen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed an Abhorrence to the Treatment Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> received, and, ſeemingly, reconciled them on the Spot; but, notwithſtanding, when the Company return'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Perſon who ſent the Challenge up Stairs at <hi>Corke,</hi> being then returned alſo, told his own Story in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſeveral warm Gentlemen of the Army were made to believe, that Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted the whole Body Military; and when the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0483300100:152"/>
poor ſuppos'd Culprit came to his Buſineſs of the Theatre, their Clamour, in the Audience, was ſo great, that the Houſe was diſmiſs'd, and no Play to be acted till Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> had aſked public Pardon upon the Stage. His high Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was, with great Difficulty, brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but at laſt he conſented. I remember the Play was, <hi>The Rival Queens; or, The Death of Alexander the Great;</hi> the Part of <hi>Alexander</hi> to be acted by the Delinquent. He came to aſk Pardon before the Curtain: When he addreſs'd the Audience, one Smart, from the Pit, cried out, <hi>Kneel, you Raſcal! Evans,</hi> then collected in himſelf, replied, in the ſame Tone of Voice, <hi>No, you Raſcal! I'll kneel to none but God, and my Queen</hi>! A dangerous Paroxyſm, at ſuch a Criſis. However, as there were many worthy Gentlemen of the Army who knew the whole Affair, the new-rais'd Clamour ceas'd, and the Play went through without any Moleſtation, and, by Degrees, Things return'd to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chanel. By this we may ſee, it is ſome Danger for an Actor to be in the right.</p>
                  <p>Three Years after this Affair, Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> went to the Theatre in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</hi> and, in his Journey back to <hi>Ireland,</hi> was taken ill of a Fever, at the Town of <hi>Whitchurch</hi> in <hi>Shorpſhire;</hi> from whence he was removed, for better Advice, to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where he ended his Progreſs of Life, in the 41ſt Year of his Age; and was privately buried in the Cathedral, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Monument, Stone, or Inſcription.</p>

                  <p>SINCE this Gentleman owes his Birth to this Kingdom, and on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Stage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Actor, I hope it will not be thought improper to give a ſhort Account of him, which I ſhall take from his Life, that I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſeveral Years paſt, to prefix to his Works.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>George Farquhar</hi> was born, in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of Parents that held no mean Rank in that Part of the Country; who, having a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Iſſue, could beſtow on him no other Fortune than a genteel Education. As thoſe who are bleſs'd with a poetical Genius always ſhew ſome Glimmerings of their Fancy in their Youth; ſo he, ere he arriv'd at his tenth Year, gave ſeveral Specimens of a peculiar Turn that Way. One of his juvenile Productions I ſhall here mention, in which he diſcovered a Way
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0483300100:156"/>
of Thinking, as well as an Elegancy of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, far beyond his Years.</p>

                  <p>He was educated in the Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he acquired a conſiderable Reputation: He began very early to apply himſelf to the Stage as an <hi>Actor,</hi> following the Examples of <hi>Lee</hi> and <hi>Otway</hi> with our great <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> and with like Succeſs; who, tho' all excellent dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Poets, made but indifferent Actors. However, Mr. <hi>Farquhar,</hi> having the Advantage of a very good Perſon, tho' with a weak Voice, was never repulſed by the Audience; but the following Accident made him determine to leave off the Occupation: Playing the Part of <hi>Guyomar</hi> in the <hi>Indian Emperor,</hi> who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to kill <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; not remembring to change his Sword for a <hi>Foil</hi>

                  <p>He was very young when he wrote his firſt Comedy of <hi>Love and a Bottle,</hi> acted at the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre Royal in <hi>Drury-lane</hi> 1698.

His laſt Comedy he wrote in ſix Weeks, with a ſettled Illneſs all the Time. He perceived the Approaches of Death before he had finiſh'd the laſt Act, and (as he had often foretold) died before the Run of the Play was over. It was affirm'd, by ſome of his near Acquaintance, his unfortunate Marriage ſhorten'd his Days; for his Wife (by whom he had two Daughters), through the Reputation of a great Fortune, trick'd him into Matrimony. This was chiefly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0483300100:158"/>
the Fault of her Love, which was ſo violent, that ſhe was reſolv'd to uſe all Arts to gain him. Tho' ſome Huſbands, in ſuch a Caſe, would have proved mere Huſbands; yet he was ſo much charm'd with her Love and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that he liv'd very happy with her. Therefore when I ſay an unfortunate Marriage, with other Circumſtances, conduced to the ſhortening of his Days; I only mean, that his Fortune, being too ſlender to ſupport a Family, led him into a great many Cares and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies: For I have often heard him ſay <note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s own Words.</note>, <q>That it was more Pain to him in imagining that his Family might want a needful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, than the moſt violent Death that could be inflicted on him <note n="b" place="bottom">
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Farquhar</hi> was a Perſon of infinite Humour, as I have been inform'd, even in his laſt Indiſpoſition. He died in the Run of the <hi>Stratagem.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him in his Illneſs. In one of theſe Viſits, Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> told Mr. <hi>Farquhar,</hi> that Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi> thought he had dealt too freely with the Character of Mrs. <hi>Sullen,</hi> in giving her to <hi>Archer</hi> without a proper Divorce, which was not a Security for her Honour. <hi>To ſalve that,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Author, <hi>I'll get a real Divorce—Marry her my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and give her my Bond ſhe ſhall be a real Widow in leſs than a Fortnight.</hi> While Mr. <hi>Farquhar</hi> was in <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> College, <hi>Dublin,</hi> he ſent to a Gentleman to borrow <hi>Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation;</hi> but the Gentleman ſent him Word he never lent any Book out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but, if he would come there, he ſhould make uſe of it as long as he pleas'd. A little While after, the Owner of the Book ſent to borrow Mr. <hi>Farquhar</hi>'s Bellows; he return'd him the Compliment—<hi>I never lend my Bellows out of my own Chamber; but if he pleas'd to come there, be ſhould make uſe of them as long as he would.</hi> When he expir'd, Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> took Care to bury him decently in <hi>St. Martin in the Fields.</hi> Among his Papers he found this ſhort Note:</p>

                  <p>AS I never had the Fortune to be preſent at this Gentleman's public Performance, I cannot pretend to be a competent Judge of his Merit; tho', I muſt own, I have heard him launch out into <hi>Mimicry,</hi> which might perhaps give Pleaſure to others, but, I muſt own, very little to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0483300100:160"/>
I remember an Inſtance of this kind of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> in my Youth, that gave Satisfaction to ſome light Hearts, but greater Diſguſt to the more judicious Sort of the Audience.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>George Powell,</hi> a reputable Actor, with many Excellencies, gave out, that he would perform the Part of Sir <hi>John Falſtaff</hi> in the Manner of that very excellent <hi>Engliſh Roſcius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Betterton.</hi> He certainly hit his Manner, and Tone of Voice; yet, to make the Picture more like, he mimick'd the Infirmities of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, old Age, and the afflicting Pains of the Gout, which that great Man was often ſeiz'd with. Certainly <hi>Mimicry</hi> is a Gift from Nature, and laudable, if made uſe of like the antient <hi>Mimes,</hi> who could dumbly deſcribe every Paſſion of the Mind, and tell a <hi>Tale</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Tongue:</hi> But to mimic the Infirmities of Nature, may well be term'd Incivility, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Inhumanity.</p>
                  <p>I remember <hi>D'Urfey,</hi> the late <hi>Lyric</hi> Poet, ſtuttered extremely when in a Paſſion, tho' he could ſpeak an Oration, read a Scene in a Play, or ſing any of his own Songs or Dialogues, without the leaſt Heſitation. He came one Morning to the Rehearſal a little diſturbed about a depending Benefit Play, and aſk'd, in a Paſſion, <hi>Wh, wh, where wa, wa, was M, M, Mr.</hi> Wi, Wilks? The Drole <hi>Penkethman</hi> anſwered, <hi>H, h, he d, d, did n, n, not kn, kn, know.</hi> But the choleric Poet broke his Head for his Joke, and it was with great Difficulty the Bard was appeaſed.</p>

                     <hi>Mimicry,</hi> as it now ſtands with us, is like a Statue, larger than the Life, made for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Height and Diſtance; while upon the Level with you, its coarſe Proportion ſeems monſtrous, and overdone. Many excellent Comedians have had this natural Talent. Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> that great Critic, tells us, that Mr. <hi>Mountford</hi> was ſo excellently gifted that Way (if we may call it Excellence), that when he was Train-bearer to the late Chancellor <hi>Jefferies,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, at an Entertainment for the moſt eminent Lawyers, his Maſter ordered him to come before him, and plead a feigned Cauſe, which he perform'd with great Eloquence; and in his Pleadings, to the Admiration of all preſent, aſſum'd the Manner and Voice of ſeveral of the beſt Pleaders then at the <hi>Bar,</hi> even ſome of thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Entertainment. As I ſaid before, every thing of this kind muſt be over-done, to make it the more ridiculous; and Actors of great Merit, <hi>thus</hi> mimick'd, are liable to ſome little Diſgrace, which is neither Juſtice nor Good-nature. I have ſeen Faces painted in a Scene of a Multitude, which is generally uſed in <hi>Drury lane</hi> Theatre at the Coronation of <hi>Anna Bullen,</hi> that make moſt ridiculous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, ſo like to be known; and yet the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they repreſent have nothing particularly faulty in their Countenance or Figures. But the Painter was a merry <hi>Italian</hi> Wag, and did it to ſhew his exuberant Fancy.</p>

But to return to Mr. <hi>Foote.</hi> He is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a good Family, and ſeems to have ſome Claim to the Eſtate of the <hi>Goodieres.</hi> One of that Family was, not many Years paſt, murdered by his own Brother at <hi>Briſtol.</hi> I believe he has <hi>Merit,</hi> or a <hi>Wou'd-be-Wit</hi> would not have publiſh'd the following Lines in the News-papers: For, I have obſerved, thoſe that have Merit, are generally liable to beſpattering Defamation.

                  <p>I Cannot tell when Mrs. <hi>Furnival</hi> firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Actreſs; but I know her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Stage-performer was ſo great, that a Perſon of high Birth and Station, who had ſeen her act ſeveral capital Parts at the Theatre in <hi>York,</hi> prevail'd on the Manager of <hi>Drury-lane</hi> to ſend for her in the Year 1737. Accordingly, I received a Commiſſion for that Purpoſe, which ſhe approved of. The firſt Part ſhe acted, at her Arrival in <hi>London,</hi> was that of the <hi>Scornful Lady,</hi> in a Comedy of <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s that bears the Title. I own it was a Character of my own chooſing, and for no other Reaſon, but that the Play had ſlept ſince the Death of the inimitable Mrs. <hi>Oldfield.</hi> The Succeſs did not intirely anſwer the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Intention, tho' ſhe acquitted herſelf ſo well, that there was a very good Actreſs in Proſpect. But the Parts in Tragedy were ſo taken up, that her Talent that Way was never once try'd in the Theatre-Royal in <hi>Drury-lane:</hi> Therefore, by the Advice of the ſame worthy Gentleman, that was the Cauſe of her leaving <hi>York</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> ſhe left <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Dublin,</hi> where her Merit was ſo conſpicuous, that her Loſs is much regretted. She is once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>England,</hi> I believe without any other Advice but her own; yet, I fear, ſhe will be remember'd here, till a better <hi>Alicia</hi> in <hi>Jane</hi>

                  <p>THIS complete Actor was born, in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> of an antient Family in that County; had a genteel Education, and was, by his Father, deſign'd for the Law. I doubt not, from his good Senſe and Affability, if he had continued in that honourable Society in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn,</hi> but he might have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Figure at the Bar, and, by his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, walk'd in the foremoſt Rank of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Orators.</p>
                  <p>His Genius led him early to ſtudy Nature, and leave the crabbed Tracts of the Law. His facetious good Humour gained him Entrance behind the Scenes, two or three Years, in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> before he commenced Actor; where his excellent Underſtanding could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Faults of others, mend them, and improve the Beauties.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1740. he ſet out, in full Luſtre, at the Theatre in <hi>Goodman's-Fields,</hi> with the Part of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third; and, by the Force of Attraction, drew even the Court to the

fartheſt Suburbs of <hi>London.</hi> After making that remote Part of the Town as familiar to Courtiers and Quality, as <hi>Wapping</hi> to Sailors; he came, with a Blaze of Light, to <hi>Drury-lane;</hi> where he began with an Act of Charity worthy of his Humanity and Goodneſs, by aſſiſting the Widow of Mr. <hi>Harper</hi> with a Sum, that, by good Management, will make her Circumſtances eaſy the reſt of her Life. She was at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the Place of her Birth, two Summers ago, where I received this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from her own Mouth. The Part he perform'd was <hi>Chamont,</hi> in the <hi>Orphan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this Gentleman was in this Kingdom laſt, I was unfortunately ſeized by a ſtubborn Indiſpoſition, and his Good-nature prevailed upon the eminent Dr. <hi>Barry</hi> to give me his Aſſiſtance: But what need I repeat, to thoſe that are not blind, that the Sun ſhines in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?

                  <p>IS deſcended from an antient Family in <hi>Wales.</hi> His Parents came to ſettle in <hi>Dublin,</hi> where this Son was born in the Year 1680. He was put 'Prentice to a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Inſtrument-maker; but a lively-ſpirited Genius made him caſt his Thoughts towards the Theatre, when he ſaw a young Actreſs that had ſufficient Charms to engage his Heart. The Paſſion of Love is not to be controuled in Youth. He marry'd her before he had ſerv'd a Third Part of his Time, quitting his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Maſter, and bent his Thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the Drama. His Talent led him to Comedy, of the merry Caſt, in which he gave great Pleaſure to the Audience.</p>
                  <p>His Wit and facetious Humour gained him many Friends, of the beſt Sort, and ſuperior Rank. In the Year 1710. the late Lord <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> gave him a Poſt in the Revenue, which he enjoyed till Death, which fell out in <hi>January</hi> 24. 1743-4. in his grand Climacteric, two Days before the Night of his Benefit; which was performed for the Widow, his ſecond Wife, who was Daughter to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Foxcroft,</hi> of <hi>Portarlington</hi> in the <hi>Queen's County,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of Merit and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> was not only a good Actor, but a pleaſing Poet, in what he attempted: His Perſon was well made, tho' low in Stature. I have ſeen a Bill of mock <hi>Alexander</hi> runs thus:</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>He was an excellent Companion, and told a Story with a peculiar Grace; and would often tell little Hiſtories of <hi>himſelf,</hi> even in Ridicule of <hi>himſelf.</hi> I ſhall mention one I had from his own Mouth.</p>
                     <p>After his commencing Actor, he contracted a Friendſhip with Mr. <hi>Wilks;</hi> which Chain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unbroke till the Death of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Comedian. Tho' Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> was very young, Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> took him with him to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and had him enter'd for that Seaſon at a ſmall Salary. The <hi>Indian Emperor</hi> being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on a ſudden to be play'd, the Part of <hi>Pizarro,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> was wanting, which Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> procur'd, with ſome Difficulty. Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> being a little indiſpoſed, would not venture out to Rehearſal, for Fear of increaſing his Indiſpoſition, to the Diſappointment of the Audience, who had not ſeen our young Stripling rehearſe. But, when he came ready, at the Entrance, his Ears were pierc'd with a Voice not familiar to him: He caſt his Eyes upon the Stage, where he beheld the diminutive <hi>Pizarro,</hi> with a Truncheon as long as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (his own Words). He ſteps up to <hi>Downs</hi> the Prompter, and cry'd, <hi>Zounds,</hi> Downs! <hi>what ſucking Scaramouch have you ſent on there? Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Downs, He's good enough for a</hi> Spaniard; <hi>the Part is ſmall. Betterton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0483300100:172"/>
                        <hi>If he had made his Eye-brows his Whiſkers, and each Whiſker a Line, the Part would have been two Lines too much for ſuch a Monkey in Buſkins.</hi> Poor <hi>Griffith</hi> ſtood on the Stage, near the Door, and heard every Syllable of the ſhort Dialogue, and by his Fears, knew who was meant by it; but, happy for him, he had no more to ſpeak that Scene. When the firſt Act was over (by the Advice of <hi>Downs)</hi> he went to make his Excuſe, with—<hi>Indeed, Sir, I had not taken the Part, but there was only I alone out of the Play. I! I</hi>! (reply'd <hi>Betterton,</hi> with a Smile) <hi>Thou art but the Tittle of an I. Griffith</hi> ſeeing him in no ill Humour, told him, <hi>Indians</hi> ought to be the beſt Figures on the Stage, as Nature had made them. <hi>Very like,</hi> reply'd <hi>Betterton; but it would be a double Death to an</hi> Indian <hi>Cobler to be conquer'd by ſuch a Weazle of a</hi> Spaniard <hi>as thou art! And, after this Night, let me never ſee a Truncheon in thy Hand again, unleſs to ſtir the Fire.</hi> This Story, as I ſaid before, was of his own telling. However, he took his Advice, laid aſide the <hi>Buſkin,</hi> and ſtuck to the <hi>Sock,</hi> in which he made a Figure equal to moſt of his Cotemporaries.</p>

                  <p>During his Stay there, he marry'd the Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Lydal,</hi> Perſons that made very good Figures in the Theatre.

A Character he bore with Juſtice. <hi>Jo,</hi> by the following Account of himſelf, muſt have been very young on the Stage. He entered a Volunteer on board the Ship where the Duke of <hi>York</hi> commanded in the Chanel, in that memorable Sea-Engagement with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, commanded (I think) by <hi>Van Tromp,</hi> in the Year 1673.

Jo</hi>'s Terrors augmented: But his Fears came to the full Height, when a Sailor aſk'd him, If he had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the Stage? <hi>Jo</hi> reply'd in the Affirmative <hi>Why then</hi> (reply'd the blunt Tarr) <hi>To-morrow, if you are not kill'd the firſt Broadſide, by G—d you will ſee the deepeſt and bloodieſt Tragedy you ever ſaw in your Life.</hi>

                  <p>THIS Gentleman was born at <hi>Lichfield</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> the 29th of <hi>September</hi> in the Year 1702. His Great Grandfather Sir <hi>Thomas Milward</hi> was Chief Juſtice of <hi>Weſt-Cheſter,</hi> and raiſed a Troop of Horſe in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0483300100:193"/>
of that unhappy Monarch King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and was then a County Palatine, which occaſioned the <hi>Rump Parliament</hi> in the Year 1659. to vote their Charter void; and I do not find it ever reſtor'd. The Family were originally from <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi> The Father of our Actor, a few Years after the Birth of his Son, removed to <hi>Uttoxeter</hi> (commonly called <hi>Tociter</hi>) in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> diſtant from <hi>London</hi> 126 meaſured Miles, formerly a Colony of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had his Education in a School of that Town, accounted one of the beſt in that Part of the Country. At fifteen his Father brought him to <hi>London,</hi> where he was put Apprentice to an eminent Apothecary in <hi>Norfolk-ſtreet</hi> in the <hi>Strand;</hi> but he has often declared, <hi>there were ſo many Dangers in the Employment,</hi> that he could never like it. The following Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made him determine to leave it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>He was ordered by his Maſter to carry his Preſcriptions to a Gentleman and Lady ill of different Maladies at the ſame time; the Labels were wrong directed, but he did not diſcover this Miſtake till the next Day, when he carried other Medicines to the ſame Perſons, and by his Judgment in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration ſoon found out the Miſtake. He was greatly terrified, but for fear of more, he let fall the Phial he had in his Hand, as by Accident, ran back to his Maſter, and told him what had been done. The Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0483300100:194"/>
ordered more proper Doſes, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents recovered, and all was well</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Milward</hi>'s firſt Eſſay in Acting was among young Gentlemen, privately, for their own Diverſion. In a ſmall time after he mixt with a Country Company of Comedians, where his Merit ſhone ſo bright, that it open'd the Eyes of the Manager in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</hi> with whom he roſe in that Theatre, and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden,</hi> to be placed in the foremoſt Rank of Perfection. He died in the 40th Year of his Age, in the very Meridian of an Actor, then belonging to the Theatre in <hi>Drury-lane.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Milward</hi> ſhall make his <hi>Exit</hi> from this worldly Stage, with an Epilogue ſpoke for the Benefit of his Widow, which will better ſpeak his Excellencies.</p>

Every Art has its Origin, but, when brought to full Perfection, it is often in Danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, and, ſometimes, of being quite loſt in Oblivion. Painting on <hi>Glaſs,</hi> in this Age, is but a faint Copy of our Forefathers in that Art; and the perdurable Cement of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Caſtles,</hi> &amp;c. is now unknown. The Sun ſets to riſe again, but <hi>Oldfield</hi>'s Light is loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>I was too young to view her firſt Dawn on the Stage, but yet had the infinite Satisfaction of her Meridian Luſtre, a Glow of Charms not to be beheld but with a trembling Eye! which held her Influence till ſet in Night.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Farquhar</hi> (as I have been informed by herſelf) brought her firſt to ſhine in Public. He accidentally, at a Tavern kept by a near Relation of Mrs. <hi>Oldfield</hi>'s, heard a Perſon reading a Comedy in a Room behind the Bar, with ſuch a juſt Vivacity, and Humour of the Characters, as gave him infinite Surprize, and Satisfaction. His Curioſity was too prevalent to obſerve the Height of good Manners; therefore he made a Pretence to go into the Room, where he was ſtruck dumb, for ſome Time, with her Figure, and blooming Beauty; but was more aſtoniſh'd at her Diſcourſe, and ſprightly Wit. Mr. <hi>Farquhar</hi> preſs'd her to purſue her Amuſement, but was obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without that Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> was, at that Time, in <hi>Ireland;</hi> therefore he took ſome Pains to acquaint Sir

                     <hi>John Vanbrugh</hi> (who had ſome Share in the Theatre) with the Jewel he had found thus by Accident. It was ſome Time before ſhe would be prevailed upon; tho' ſhe has merrily told me, <hi>I long'd to be at it, and only wanted a little decent Intreaties.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Alinda,</hi> in the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> was the firſt Part ſhe was taken Notice of in, which Sir <hi>John Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh</hi> alter'd and reviv'd upon her Account; which is a Character of different Species of Paſſions and Variety; where ſhe charm'd the Play into a Run of many ſucceeding Nights.</p>
                  <p>I remember, in her full Round of Glory in Comedy, ſhe uſed to ſlight Tragedy. She would often ſay, <hi>I hate to have a Page dragging my Tail about. Why do they not give</hi> Porter <hi>theſe Parts? She can put on a better Tragedy Face than I can.</hi> When <hi>Mithridates</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, it was with much Difficulty ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon to take the Part; but ſhe perform'd it to the utmoſt Length of Perfection, and, after that, ſhe ſeem'd much better reconcil'd to Tragedy. What a majeſtical Dignity in <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>! and, indeed, in every Part that required it: Such a finiſh'd Figure on the Stage, was never yet ſeen.

Her excellent clear Voice of Paſſion, her piercing flaming Eye, with Manner and Action ſuiting, us'd to make me ſhrink with Awe, and ſeem'd to put her Monitor <hi>Horatio</hi> into a Mouſe-hole. I almoſt gave him up for a troubleſome Puppy; and though Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> play'd the Part of <hi>Lothario,</hi> I could hardly lug him up to the Importance of triumphing over ſuch a finiſh'd Piece of Perfection, that ſeemed to be too much dignified to loſe her Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Even her Amours ſeemed to loſe that Glare which appears round the Perſons of the failing Fair; neither was it ever known, that ſhe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Repoſe of any Lady's lawful Claim; and was far more conſtant than Millions in the conjugal Nooſe.</p>
                  <p>She was of a ſuperior Height, but with a lovely Proportion; and the Dignity of her Soul, equal to her Form and Stature, made up of benevolent Charity, affable and good-natur'd to all that deſerv'd it. Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> Son to the Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi> when he was perſecuted by his unnatural Mother, received from her ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving bountiful Hand, Fifty Pounds a Year during her Life; and ſhe was, with Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> a main Means in ſaving him from an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious End.</p>
                  <p>The Part of <hi>Sophoniſba,</hi> a Tragedy (by Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> famed for many excellent Poems), was reputed the Cauſe of her Death; for, in her Execution, ſhe went beyond Wonder, to Aſtoniſhment! From that Time her Decay

came ſlowly on, and never left her till it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her to eternal Reſt, the 23d of <hi>October</hi> 1730. She left ſeveral charitable Legacies, and very handſome Fortunes to her two Sons. But let us ſee what better Writers ſay of this Phoenix of the Stage.

His Order bore, That he ſhould retire to his Eſtate the next Day; and therefore, as the laſt Remedy for his Love, he propoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Marriage to Mrs. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no other Effect than a mortifying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal <note n="e" place="bottom">We may gather, from this Author, that the Paſſage mention'd was in the Year 1715. when the Rebel Lords ſuffer'd Death, and Lord <hi>Nithiſdale</hi> made his Eſcape from the <hi>Tower,</hi> diſguiſed by his Lady in her Habit. Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Moſtings,</hi> then Commander in the Fourth Troop of Life-guards, ſpoke too freely in Favour of the impriſon'd Noblemen that were concern'd in the Rebellion, and therefore was order'd to leave the Court, and retire to his Eſtate; as alſo the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Aileſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Lords <hi>Finche</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> my Lord <hi>Portmore,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> and many others; all depriv'd of their Poſts and Places, with the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to retire to their Eſtates.

                  <p>IN the Remembrance of many, was once on the Stage in this Kingdom, to his no ſmall Terror: For a Storm at Sea, he told me, frighten'd him ſo much, that the Anxiety of returning dwelt ſo ſtrongly on his Mind, that he could not appear half himſelf to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; and, to leſſen his Sea-voyage back again, he went to <hi>Dunaghadee,</hi> in the North of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and embark'd for <hi>Scotland;</hi> verifying the old Proverb, <hi>The fartheſt Way about, is the neareſt Way home.</hi>

                  <head>Mr. JAMES QUIN.</head>
                  <p>THIS great and juſt Actor was born in <hi>King-ſtreet, Covent-garden,</hi> the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> 1693. tho' Numbers believe he owes his Birth to <hi>Ireland.</hi> His Anceſtors were of an antient Family in this Kingdom: His Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, Alderman <hi>Mark Quin,</hi> was Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> in the Year 1676. in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; the Father of our <hi>Roſcius</hi> received a liberal Education in <hi>Trinity</hi> College, <hi>Dublin;</hi> from thence he went over to <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn,</hi> to finiſh his Studies, where he was called to the Bar; but, at the Death of his Father (who left him a plentiful Eſtate), he returned with his Son, then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, to take Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>James Quin</hi> was educated under the Care of Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> (a Perſon emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Learning), till the Death of his Father in the Year 1710. Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> was undoubted Heir to his Eſtate, but through his Youth, and Inexperience of the Courts, a Suit of Law hung ſo long in <hi>Chancery,</hi> till he, unenabled to carry the Cauſe farther, was obliged to drop it, for want of proper Aſſiſtance. I am inform'd, a powerful Guider of the Law was his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt; and a Perſon has but a bad Chance to fight a Duel with a Fencing-maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0483300100:221"/>
Our eminent Actor firſt appeared on the Stage in old <hi>Smock-alley,</hi> in the Part of <hi>Abel</hi> in the <hi>Committee.</hi> I muſt take ſome little Pride, when I declare I imagine myſelf the firſt that perſuaded him not to ſmother his riſing Genius in this Kingdom, where, at that Time, there was no great Encouragement for Merit, and try his Fortune in <hi>London;</hi> whither, by his kind and ever-to-be-remember'd Recommendation, I ſoon follow'd him.</p>
                  <p>It is, in ſome ſort, a Hardſhip to a riſing Genius, in the firſt Entrance to a regular eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Company: The Parts are all ſupplied, and, like Under-officers in an Army, they muſt wait for Preſerment, or do ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, before they can expect it. An Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fell out, that gave our young Actor a happy Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>The Managers had an Order, from the <hi>Lord Chamberlain,</hi> to revive the Play of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> for the 4th of <hi>November</hi> 1716. which was got up with the utmoſt Magnificence. The third Night the late Mr. <hi>Mills</hi> (who perform'd <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi>) was taken ſuddenly ill, and, with much Perſuaſion, Mr. <hi>Quin</hi> was prevailed upon to read the Part, which was thought a great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for a young Actor of his Standing; but, to the Mortification of ſeveral Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, he ſucceeded ſo well, that the Audience gave him their general Applauſe, through the whole Courſe of the Part. The next Night he made himſelf perfect, and performed it with redoubled Applauſes of Approbation; and was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0483300100:222"/>
complimented by ſeveral Perſons of Diſtinction, and dramatic Taſte, upon his early riſing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</p>
                  <p>But as the Theatrical World is a Picture, in Miniature, of the Great, Envy will ſhake her ſnaky Locks; People of twice his Age thought his Progreſs a little too rapid for their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. His Temper took fire at the viſible Depreſſion; he bore it ſome Time with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but the firſt Opportunity he engag'd with Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> in <hi>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</hi> where, by juſt Degrees, he attained the higheſt Round of Perfection; and (not to take any Merit from other Performers) was certainly the chief Pillar that ſupported all the Theatres where-ever he has performed. I will not take upon me to point out his Excellencies in any particular Part, ſince he is excellent in all: Therefore I ſhall end, with the immortal <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>He is a Man, take him for all in all,</l>
                        <l>I ne'er ſhall look upon his Like again.</l>

                  <p>The great Honour this Gentleman has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ſecond Illuſtrious Perſon in the Kingdom, in truſting the Royal Blood to his Care, will better ſpeak his Excellence than my weak Skill can do.</p>

                  <head>Mr. LACY RYAN.</head>
                  <p>THIS Gentleman was once in <hi>Ireland</hi> with the celebrated Mr. <hi>Quin,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Clive,</hi> in the Year 1741. He was born in <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1694. The firſt Part he was taken Notice of in, was that of <hi>Marcus</hi> in <hi>Cato,</hi> which was firſt acted in 1712.</p>
                  <p>In the Run of that celebrated Tragedy he was accidentally brought into a Fray with ſome of our <hi>Tritons</hi> on the <hi>Thames;</hi> and, in the Scuffle, a Blow on the Noſe was given him by one of theſe Water-bullies, who neither regard Men nor Manners: I remember, the ſame Night, as he was brought on the <hi>Bier,</hi> after his ſuppos'd Death in the Fourth Act of <hi>Cato,</hi> the Blood, from the real Wound in the Face, guſh'd out with Violence; that Hurt had no other Effect than juſt turning his Noſe a little, tho' not to Deformity; yet ſome People ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it gave a very ſmall Alteration to the Tone of his Voice, tho' nothing diſagreeable. He acquitted himſelf in many capital Parts, both in Tragedy and Comedy, to the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Auditors; and has been ever eſteemed in the firſt Rank of Actors.</p>
                  <p>Some few Years ago another unfortunate Accident befel him: As he was going home to his Houſe after his Night's Performance, he was attack'd by a Street robber; and, making Reſiſtance, the Villain ſhot a Brace of Piſtol-Bullets
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0483300100:224"/>
into his Mouth, which broke ſome Part of his Jaw: By the Help of a Lamp the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber knew Mr. <hi>Ryan,</hi> as I have been inform'd, begg'd his Pardon for his Miſtake, and ran off. Of this Hurt, too, he recover'd, after a long Illneſs, and play'd with Succeſs, as before, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſeeming Alteration of Voice or Face. His Royal Highneſs, upon this Accident, ſent him a handſome Preſent; and others, of the Nobility, copy'd the laudable Example of the ſecond illuſtrious Perſon in the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. I ſhall ſay no more of Mr. <hi>Ryan,</hi> but that he is genteel, and well-made.</p>
                  <p>This Gentleman has made ſeveral Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Region of Poetry; particularly a Piece, of one Act, call'd <hi>The Coblers Opera,</hi> which has often been performed with good Succeſs.</p>

                  <p>THIS excellent Actor was born in this Kingdom, Son to that very eminent the Reverend Dr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> a Gentleman whoſe Memory will never be forgot, while Learning holds the Reins to check the vicious Mind, and guide us in the Paths of Virtue. Men are but human Brutes, poring in the Dark, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Light of Education. Under ſuch a Father, and at ſuch a Fountain of Learning as this Nurſery of Erudition <hi>(Trinity</hi> College), no Wonder for our young Actor to riſe in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. He was ſome Time in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School, and as his Mind led him to look early towards the Drama, he had the Advantage of ſeeing the Regularity of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Theatres, which he does not only copy, but many, who have ſeen both, find the Colours and Drapery ſo ſtrong, that, at this Diſtance, it ſtands in equal Goodneſs to the Original.</p>
                  <p>To this Gentleman we owe the Decency that has been long wanting on the <hi>Hibernian</hi> Stage, a Difficulty no one Perſon could have ſurmounted but himſelf; and tho' Merit does

not always meet its proper Reward, yet the Seeds of Flowers and Roots he had planted and ſown in this theatrical Garden, flouriſh ſweet and amiable, and, like a Maſter in the Art, Reward follows his Pains and Judgment in Culture.</p>

                  <p>WAS an Actor of Repute in this Kingdom about Thirty Years paſt, and ſtood in many capital Parts, being then a Sharer in old <hi>Smock-Alley</hi> Theatre with Mr. <hi>Thomas El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To let you ſee how formerly even Tragedy Heroes were now-and-then put to their Shifts, I'll tell you a ſhort Story that befel Mr. <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a Cuſtom, at that Time, for Perſons of the Firſt Rank and Diſtinction to give their Birth-Day Suits to the moſt favoured Actors. I think Mr. <hi>Thurmond</hi> was honour'd by General <hi>Ingoldſby</hi> with his. But his <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> being at the laſt Tide of Ebb, the rich Suit was put in <hi>Buckle</hi> (a Cant Word for Forty in the Hundred Intereſt): One Night, Notice was given that the General would be preſent with the <hi>Government</hi> at the Play, and all the Performers on the Stage were preparing to dreſs out in the Suits preſented. The Spouſe of <hi>Johnny</hi> (as he was commonly called) try'd all her Arts to perſuade Mr. <hi>Holdfaſt</hi> the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0483300100:232"/>
Pawnbroker <hi>(as it fell out, his real Name)</hi> to let go the Cloaths for that Evening, to be returned when the Play was over: But all Arguments were fruitleſs; nothing but the <hi>Ready,</hi> or a Pledge of full equal Value. Such People would have deſpiſed a <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> or a <hi>Cicero,</hi> with all their Rhetorical Flouriſhes, if their Oratorian Gowns had been in Pledge. Well! what muſt be done? The whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in Confuſion, and all at their Wits-End; Diſgrace, with her glaring Eyes, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mouth, ready to devour. Fatal Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! At laſt <hi>Winny</hi> the Wife (that is, <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifrede</hi>) put on a compos'd Countenance (but, alas! with a troubled Heart); ſtepp'd to a neighbouring Tavern, and beſpoke a very hot <hi>Negus,</hi> to comfort <hi>Johnny</hi> in the great Part he was to perform that Night, begging to have the Silver Tankard with the Lid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as ſhe ſaid, <hi>a Covering, and the Vehicle Silver, would retain Heat longer than any other Metal.</hi> The Requeſt was comply'd with, the <hi>Negus</hi> carry'd to the Play-houſe piping hot—popp'd into a vile earthen Mug—the Tankard <hi>L'argent</hi> travelled <hi>Incog.</hi> under her Apron (like the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ladies veil'd), popp'd into the Pawnbroker's Hands, in exchange for the Suit—put on, and play'd its Part, with the reſt of the Wardrobe; when its Duty was over, carried back to remain in its old Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory—the Tankard return'd the right Road; and, when the Tide flow'd with its Lunar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, the ſtranded Suit was waſted into ſafe

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thurmond</hi> died in <hi>London,</hi> when he was one of the Company in <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Theatre; a merry, good-natured Companion to the laſt.</p>

Our great Comedian was born at <hi>Rathfarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> near <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the Year 1670. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave him a genteel Education. He wrote an excellent fine maſterly Hand, with ſuch Celerity that was ſurpriſing. His Genius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to Secretary <hi>Southwell,</hi> who confirm'd him one of his Clerks when Eighteen Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Inclination to the <hi>Theatre</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Praiſes of Mr. <hi>Richards,</hi> then an Actor on the <hi>Dublin</hi> Stage. Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> lodg'd near Mr. <hi>Wilks;</hi> and, being intimate with each other, he uſed to hold the Book of the Play, to hear if <hi>Richards</hi> was perfect in the Part he was then ſtudying. Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> uſed to read the introductive Speeches, with ſuch proper Emphaſis, Cadence, and all the various Paſſions, that the Encomiums given by Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> began to fire his Mind for the <hi>Drama.</hi> It was with very little Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ventured to act privately the <hi>Colonel</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Fryar,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Aſhbury</hi>'s, the enſuing <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> where he received ſuch Approbation from that great Maſter, as confirm'd his Intention.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Part he played on the Theatre was <hi>Othello,</hi> with the utmoſt Applauſe; and, as he told me, pleaſed all but himſelf. He went on with great Succeſs, for Two Years, when his Friend Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Aſhbury</hi> informed me, that Mr. <hi>Richards</hi> was a very good Actor, both in Tragedy and Comedy, but not over-happy in his perſonal Appearance.</note>adviſed him to try his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0483300100:239"/>
Fortune in <hi>England,</hi> and gave him Letters of Recommendation to Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him very kindly, and entered him at Fifteen Shillings a Week.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Appearance on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage, was in the Part of the young Prince in the <hi>Maid's Tragedy,</hi> a very inſignificant Character, requiring little more than an amiable Figure. Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> performed <hi>Melantius;</hi> but when that veteran Actor came to addreſs him on the Battlements, to excuſe himſelf for the Death of the King in the Play, Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> affirmed to me, that the Dignity of Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> ſtruck him with ſuch an Awe, that he had much ado to utter the little he had to ſay. Mr. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton,</hi> obſerving his Confuſion, ſaid to him, <hi>Young Man, this Fear does not ill become you; a Horſe that ſets out at the Strength of his Speed will ſoon be jaded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> ſoon ſhook off his Apprehenſions, and began to riſe in the Eſteem of the Audience, and better Parts gained him a better Salary.</p>
                  <p>He often aſſiſted Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> (an eminent Dancing-maſter at that time) in teaching his Scholars; and, by his genteel Addreſs, gained the Affection of a young Lady, Daughter to <hi>Ferdinand Knapton,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Steward of the New Foreſt in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and by Conſent of the Father they were joined in Wedlock. By this Gentlewoman he had one Son and Daughter; the Son died in his Youth; the Daughter was

married to Captain <hi>Price</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s Finances not well anſwering the State of an increaſing Family, he preſs'd for an Addition to his Salary, which every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but the <hi>Manager</hi> thought he deſerved; but his Requeſt was not complied with.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Aſhbury</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hearing of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, came over on Purpoſe to engage him. He agreed with Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> for Sixty Pounds a Year, and a clear Benefit, which in thoſe Times was much more than any other Actor ever had. When he went to take his Leave of Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> the <hi>Manager</hi> was with him. That great Actor expreſſed ſome Concern at his leaving the Company. "I fanſy (ſaid Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi>) that Gentleman (pointing to the Manager), if he has not too much Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy to own it, will be the firſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents your parting; for, if I foreſee aright, you will be greatly wanted here."</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> told me this Speech gave him infinite Pleaſure; and made him reſolve to ſearch into himſelf, to find out what Mr. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton</hi>'s known Judgment ſeemed to promiſe he might find. Praiſe from an Adept in any Science will excite Emulation, and, with ſome People, do more than Reward. From this Time Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> grew more aſſiduous, and thought every Moment loſt, that was not laid

                  <p>It was not long before the prophetic Words of Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> were fulfilled. For the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Death of <hi>Mountford</hi>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>William Mountford</hi> was accounted an excellent Comedian; and Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> often confeſs'd, he was the Glaſs that he ever adjuſted himſelf by.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Mountford</hi> was baſely murder'd by a Thruſt thro' the Back, while a falſe Friend held him in his Arms with a treacherous Embrace, in <hi>Norfolk-ſtreet</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> in the Year 1692. He was the Author of the following Plays.</p>
                        <p>1. Injur'd Love, or, The Ambitious Father. A Tragedy, 1688.</p>
                        <p>2. The Succeſsful Strangers. A Comedy, 1690.</p>

was the Sickneſs of all their genteel Comedies, till his Parts could be ſupplied. Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> therefore, was immediately ſent to, with Propoſals of Four Pounds a Week; which was a Salary equal to Mr. <hi>Betterton.</hi> This was too advantageous an Offer to be refuſed; therefore he prepared for his Journey privately. Mr. <hi>Aſhbury</hi> was ſo unwilling to part with him, that he procured an Order from the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> (then Lord Lieutenant) to prevent his going; but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friend giving him timely Notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he went ſecretly to <hi>Hoath,</hi> where a Boat waited to convey him on board, and he landed ſafe in <hi>England.</hi>

The firſt Part he performed of <hi>Mountford</hi>'s was <hi>Palamede</hi>

He took great Delight in Shooting. One Day he went out with his Servant to his uſual Diverſion; they ſprung ſome Game that flew over a neighbouring Hedge; he ordered his Servant to follow and obſerve them on the other Side, while he would take care on the Side where he was. The Hedge was of great Extent, and Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> went ſlowly by the Side, in Expectation of the Game; at laſt they came, and he fired. The Servant on the other Side of the Hedge did the ſame, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſhot his Maſter in the Face, only with Two Grains of Shot; but, alas! one in each Eye, that for ever deprived him of Sight! Yet Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> inform'd me, he was as chearful a Gentleman as ever he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with; and would lead him to every particular Fruit-tree in his large Garden, and nominate the Fruit they bore; and that very Servant, the <hi>Innocent Guilty,</hi> as he call'd him, lived with him at the Time I received this Account from Mr. <hi>Wilks.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s Excellence in Comedy was never once diſputed, but the beſt Judges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol him for the different Parts in Tragedy; as <hi>Hamlet, Caſtalio</hi> in the <hi>Orphan, Ziphares</hi> in <hi>Mithridates, Edgar</hi> in King <hi>Lear, Norfolk</hi> in the <hi>Albion Queens, Piercy</hi> in <hi>Anna Bullen,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex, Shore, Macduff, Moneſes</hi> in <hi>Tamerlane, Jaffeir</hi> in <hi>Venice Preſerv'd;</hi> and a countleſs Catalogue of other Parts in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, which he was allowed to perform in their full Perfection.</p>

But let me have recourſe to other Pens for his Excellencies. One writes thus:</p>

                     <q>No ſooner had Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> left the <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Stage, and appeared on the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> but that ſinking Theatre raiſed its drooping Head; and what was reckoned almoſt a Scandal to belong to, has ever ſince been, by that great Man's Management and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, raiſed to the greateſt Theatre in the Univerſe.</q>

                     <q>This Performance <hi>(The Trip to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee)</hi> is the greateſt Inſtance that we can have of the irreſiſtible Force of proper Action. Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> enters into the Part with ſo much Skill, that the Gallantry, the Youth, and Gaiety, of a young Man of a plentiful Fortune, is looked upon with as much Indulgence on the Stage, as in real Life.</q>

                  <p>In the Preface to the ſame Play the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays: "Whenever the Stage has the Misfortune to loſe Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> that <hi>Wildair</hi> may go to the <hi>Jubilee.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>In the Preface to the <hi>Stratagem,</hi> the Author ends thus: <q>The Reader may find ſome Faults in this Play, which my Illneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the amending of; but there is great Amends made in the Repreſentation, which cannot be matched, no more than
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0483300100:246"/>
the friendly and indefatigable Care of Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> to whom I chiefly owe the Succeſs of the Play.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is enough ſaid to illuſtrate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Qualifications of this Gentleman as an Actor; therefore let me attempt to delineate his Mind.</p>
                  <p>His Purſe was ever open to proper Objects of Charity; and I have often ſeen Tears in his Eyes at the Relation of any Misfortune that befel others. He was ever the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer in any joint Charity from the Theatrical Stock, and, I am convinced, has often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon their unwilling Liberality. His Care of the Orphan Daughters of Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quhar,</hi> by giving them ſeveral Benefit Plays, continued to the laſt of his Days; and, in loſing him, they have in Reality loſt a Father: But, I hope, his conſtant Stream of Bounty has placed them above Want. In ſhort, his private Acts of Charity are numberleſs. I ſhall add one in particular.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman, a Native of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>Smith,</hi> who received a liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Trinity-College, Dublin,</hi> brought a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy to the Managers of the Theatre-Royal in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> for their Approbation: The Play was read, and returned, with Deſire to make ſome Alterations for the next Seaſon. This poſtponing but ill agreed with our Author's Circumſtances, that loudly called for a ſpeedy Supply. Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> knowing the ill State of his Finances, bought a Night of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0483300100:247"/>
ther Managers, and gave it to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> for a Benefit. Yet he did not think that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but uſed all his Intereſt to make it truly a Benefit, and put a Hundred Guineas clear in the Author's Pocket; with which he took Leave of his Benefactor, and the Muſes; embarked for <hi>Holland,</hi> where he put himſelf under the Tuition of the great <hi>Boerhaave</hi> at <hi>Leyden;</hi> and, in time, profited ſo well, that his great Maſter of Medicine ſent him to <hi>Peterſburgh,</hi> at the Requeſt of the <hi>Czarina,</hi> where, at his firſt Arrival, a handſome Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſettled upon him. I have ſeen ſeveral Letters from this Gentleman to Mr. <hi>Wilks;</hi> a Copy of one I procured from his Widow, which I ſhall give as a Note, for the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of it <note n="q" place="bottom">

When Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, I muſt ſee it with a Candle; for my Windows will be covered with a cold Coat of Froſt, more of a thick <hi>Subſtance</hi> than the Glaſs; and yet it is not three to one, but To-morrow's Sun's ſhort Progreſs will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath 'em, and leave 'em ſlark naked again. If I were to appear before you, faſhionably dreſs'd, you would take me for a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Bear, I am ſo clumſily <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furr'd,</hi> not only <hi>from Top to Toe</hi> (as <hi>Hamlet</hi> ſays), but Head and Feet.</p>

                              <p>I have a good Stomach, and eat and drink well. Here is no want of any thing, but Warmth in our long Winter, and Coolneſs in our ſhort Summer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Degrees different from you in both.

My Royal Miſtreſs is a good plump round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd Lady, and does me the Honour to aſk me ſome Queſtions, now we underſtand each other. Were you here, you would have but a ſmall Share in Amours; Love goes by Weight in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and thoſe that thrive in Fleſh, ſucceed beſt.

                  <p>The Meaning why I mention this Letter is, that the Son, the very Night this Letter was wrote, in all Appearance, expir'd, was ſtripp'd and waſh'd, the Bed taken away, and he laid ſtretch'd on a Mat, with a Baſon of Salt (a common Cuſtom in <hi>England</hi>) placed on his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the inconſolable Parents remov'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Houſe, the Coffin brought to the Son's
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0483300100:253"/>
Chamber, and the Windows all open. About Eight at Night a Perſon was ſent with a Light to watch the Corpſe: When ſhe open'd the Door, the firſt Object ſhe perceiv'd was poor <hi>Bob</hi> (as he was generally call'd by his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars) ſitting up, with his Teeth trembling in his Head (and well they might) with Cold. The Woman, in her Fright, dropp'd the Candle, and ſcream'd out, <hi>The Devil! the Devil</hi>! This Fright alarm'd another Woman below, who ran up-ſtairs to ſee what was the Matter: In the mean time <hi>Bob,</hi> with much ado, had made a Shift to get from the Bed; and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Candle, which lay upon the Floor unextinguiſh'd, was creeping to the Door to call for Aſſiſtance, as naked as from the Womb of his Mother; which the two Women per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, with joint Voices repeated again, <hi>A Ghoſt! a Ghoſt! the Devil! the Devil</hi>! The Maſter of the Houſe, hearing this Uproar, ran himſelf, to know the Reaſon; where poor <hi>Bob,</hi> the ſuppos'd Devil, and he, ſoon came to a right Underſtanding. He was put into a warm Bed, to the unſpeakable Joy of his deſponding Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and in ten Days after in <hi>London (viva voce)</hi> told me the whole Story of his Death.</p>
                  <p>This Accident, when real Death paid him a Viſit, work'd ſo ſtrongly upon his forlorn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that they would not let his Corpſe be coffin'd till five Days after he expir'd. Vain Hope! He died in 1743. in the 35th Year of his Age. Both his Parents died ſoon after him. I am ſorry to end this Account with ſaying, his

                  <p>THIS Perſon was born in the Year 1700. In his Youth he was a very promiſing Actor. The Part of <hi>Charles</hi> in the <hi>Nonjuror,</hi> a Comedy founded upon <hi>Moliere</hi>'s <hi>Tartuff,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> which was perform'd at the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre-Royal in <hi>Drury-lane</hi> in the Year 1717. gave him the firſt Eſtabliſhment as an Actor. The Applauſe he gain'd from performing the Part of <hi>Macheath</hi> in the <hi>Beggars Opera,</hi> was fatal to him: He follow'd <hi>Bacchus</hi> too ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, inſomuch that his Credit was often drown'd upon the Stage, and, by Degrees, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt render'd him uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>He was the ſuppos'd Author of two dramatic Pieces; <hi>viz. The Quakers Opera,</hi> and a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy call'd <hi>The Fate of Villainy.</hi> This Play he brought to <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Year 1744. and prevailed on the Proprietors to act it, under the Title of <hi>Love and Loyalty.</hi> The ſecond Night was given out for his Benefit; but not being able to pay in Half the Charge of the common Expences, the Doors were order'd to be kept

ſhut: But, I remember, few People came to aſk the Reaſon. However, I fear this Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment haſten'd his Death; for he ſurvived it but three Days; dying, in the 44th Year of his Age, a Martyr to what often ſtole from him a good Underſtanding.</p>

But this was not all; the Laugh and Roar began in the Audience, till it frighten'd poor <hi>Warren</hi> ſo much, that, with the Bier at his Tail, he threw down <hi>Caliſta</hi> (Mrs. <hi>Barry),</hi> and overwhelm'd her with the Table, Lamp, Book, Bones, together with all the Lumber of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-houſe. He tugg'd, till he broke off his Trammels, and made his Eſcape; and the Play, at once, ended with immoderate Fits of Laughter: Even the grave Mr. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton</hi>
                           <q>

                           </q>
But he would not let the <hi>Fair Penitent</hi> be play'd any more that Seaſon, till poor <hi>Warren</hi>'s Miſconduct was ſomething forgot.</p>

I ſhall leave this Lady to proceed in her Path of Merit where ſhe ſtill leads, with an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> wrote purely for her Manner of Speaking: And as <hi>Prologues</hi> and <hi>Epilogues</hi> are the moſt difficult Taſks of both Sexes on the Stage, it is to be remark'd, but few, beſides the capital Performers, are truſted with them; and a good Prologue and Epilogue have often help'd a bad Play out of the Mire, or, at leaſt, ſent the Audience home a little better humour'd.</p>
