            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>IT ſeems to be a kind of duty incumbent on thoſe who devote themſelves to Poetry, to raiſe, if poſſible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Compoſition, and the character of modern Times will allow: The ages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are paſt, in which the ſong of the Poet was idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for its <hi>miraculous effects;</hi> yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may ſtill perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of ſome little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to ſociety in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by ſober Reaſon, it is at leaſt one of thoſe pleaſing and innocent delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in which a poetical Enthuſiaſt may be ſafely indulged.</p>
               <p>The following production owes its exiſtence to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in real life, very ſimilar to the principal action of
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0310600105:5"/>
the laſt Canto; but in forming the general plan of the work, it ſeemed to me abſolutely neceſſary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a ſubject ſo happily executed by the maſterly pencil of Pope. I conſidered his Cave of Spleen as a moſt exquiſite ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet picture; and, to avoid the ſervility of imitation, I determined to ſketch the manſion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvaſs: Happy, indeed, if the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Public may enable me to exclaim, with the honeſt vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael,
<q>"E ſon Pittore anch' Io!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>The celebrated Aleſſandro Taſſoni, who is generally conſidered as the inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was ſo proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of compoſition, that he not only ſpoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS. copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an inſcription, in which he ſtiled it a new ſpecies of Poetry, invented by himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0310600105:6"/>
A few partial friends have aſſerted, that the preſent performance has ſome degree of ſimilar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it poſſeſſes, may rather require an apology, than entitle its Author to challenge commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, I ſhall explain how far the conduct of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em differs from the moſt approved models in this mode of writing, and ſlightly mention the poetical effects, which ſuch a variation appeared likely to produce.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that the favourite Poems, which blend the ſerious and the comic, repreſent their principal characters in a ſatirical point of view: It was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Taſſoni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to ſatirize a particular Italian Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who happened to be the object of his reſentment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Eccleſiaſtics in his Lutrin; Garth, our Engliſh Phyſicians, in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary; and the Rape of the Lock itſelf, that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and enchanting Poem, which I never contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate but with new idolatry, is denominated <hi>the beſt Satire extant,</hi> by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very clegant and ingenious, but ſevere Eſſay on Pope: A ſentence which ſeems to be confirmed by the Poet himſelf, in his letter to Mrs. Fermor, where he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0310600105:7"/>
of Belinda, as it is now managed, reſembles you in nothing but in beauty."</q> Though I think, that no compoſition can ſurpaſs, or perhaps ever equal this moſt happy effort of Genius, as a ſportive Satire, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it might be poſſible to give a new Character to this mixed ſpecies of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the moſt beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have ſeen it carried to inimitable perfection, in the moſt delicate raillery on Female Foibles:—It remained to be tried, if it might not alſo aſpire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence. The idea appeared to me worth the experiment; for, if it ſucceeded, it ſeemed to promiſe a double advantage; firſt, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, ſecondly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more intereſting to the heart. On theſe principles, I have endeavoured to paint <hi>SERENA</hi> as a moſt lovely, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, and accompliſhed character; yet I hope the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring is ſo faithfully copied from <hi>general Nature,</hi> that every man, who reads the Poem, may be happy enough to know many Fair ones, who reſemble my Heroine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0310600105:8"/>
There is another point, in which I have alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to give this Poem an air of novelty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the viſionary ſcenes, which compoſe it; by ſhifting theſe in alternate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Picture afford a ſtrong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance particularly diverſified. I wiſhed, indeed (but I fear moſt ineffectually) for powers to unite ſome touches of the ſportive wildneſs of Arioſto, and the more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſublime painting of Dante, with ſome portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagination, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if poſſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating thoſe rules of propriety, which Mr. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge has illuſtrated, by example as well as precept, in The Scribleriad, and in his ſenſible Preface to that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and learned Poem.</p>
               <p>I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the <hi>extent,</hi> or rather of the <hi>extravagance</hi> of my deſire; for I will not give it the ſerious name of <hi>deſign:</hi> They, whom an enlightened taſte has rendered thoroughly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how very difficult it muſt be to accompliſh ſuch an idea, will not only be the firſt to diſcern, but the moſt
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0310600105:9"/>
ready to pardon thoſe errors, into which ſo hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public, by a Diſſertation of conſiderable length on this ſpecies of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge myſelf any farther in ſuch preliminary remarks, as the anxiety of authors is ſo apt to produce, from the reflection, that, however ingeniouſly written, they add little or nothing to the ſucceſs of a good Poem, and are utterly inſufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</p>
               <p>In diſmiſſing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their peruſal, I ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the pleaſant and courteous Taſſoni— <q>
                     <l>"Vaglia il buon voler, s' altro non lice,</l>

And, indeed, when I reflect on the inimitable talents, the public ſpirit, and the charitable inſtitutions of Swift, I am almoſt ready to addreſs his Spirit with this humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apoſtrophe:
<q>"I confeſs that I have done thee wrong."—</q>
But a ſuperior attention to the intereſt of ſociety inclines me to perſevere in a very different ſentiment, and ſtill to think, that no talents, no virtues in a writer, can properly exempt even the moſt brilliant work from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reprehenſion, when, inſtead of improving, it has an evident tendency to debaſe and vilify human nature—a tendency, that I conſider as moſt evident in the compoſition to which I have alluded:—if I am wrong in this idea, I may yet ſhelter myſelf under the authority of two moſt honourable names—a moral Poet of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and exalted ſpirit, and a learned Critic of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite candour and diſcernment.—In Young's Eſſay on Original Compoſition, and in the poſthumous work juſt bequeathed to the public by the lamented Mr. Harris, the miſanthropy of Swift is moſt warmly cenſured. The words of the latter are ſo ſtriking and appoſite, that I cannot wiſh for a ſtronger juſtification. <q rend="inline">"Miſanthropy is ſo dangerous a thing, and goes ſo far in ſapping the very foundations of Morality and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that I eſteem the laſt part of Swift's Gulliver (that I mean relative to his Houyhnhnms and Yahoos) to be a worſe book to peruſe, than thoſe which we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, as the moſt flagitious and obſcene. One abſurdity in this Author (a wretched Philoſopher though a great Wit) is well worth remarking—in order to render the nature of Man odious, and the nature of Beaſts ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he is compelled to give human characters to his Beaſts, and beaſtly characters to his Men; ſo that we are to admire the Beaſts, not for being Beaſts, but amiable Men; and to deteſt the Men, not for being Men, but deteſtable Beaſts."</q>

               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>AS the following Plays were intended only for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate theatre, I have been tempted by that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to introduce a kind of novelty into our language, by writing three comedies in rhyme, though the Comic Muſe of our country has been long accuſtomed to expreſs herſelf in proſe, and her cuſtom has the ſanction of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled precept, and ſucceſsful example. The Antiquarian, indeed, may remind me that Gammer Gurton's Needle, one of the earlieſt of our old plays, with other comic productions of that rude period, was written in rhyme; and poſſibly ſome faſtidious enemies of that Gothic jin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, as they affect to call it, may conſider the preſent Publication as nothing more than a relapſe into the moſt barbarous mode of dramatic compoſition.</p>
               <p>For the boldneſs of an attempt, which has no modern precedent to plead in its behalf, ſome apology may be due to the Public.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I beg it may not be ſuppoſed, that by writing a comedy in rhyme, I mean to convey an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0310600105:173"/>
cenſure on the contrary practice. No one can prize more highly than I do the many excellent comedies in proſe, with which our language is enriched. I am very far from entertaining a wiſh to overturn the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial which the Comic Muſe of England has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; but I hope to find our country as much a friend to toleration in the forms of literature, as in thoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The cuſtom of other enlightened nations, both ancient and modern, may be pleaded on this occaſion in behalf of verſe. Ariſtophanes, in his play of the Clouds, ſeems to pride himſelf on his poetry. Arioſto having written two comedies in proſe, converted them both into metre at a maturer period of his life; and Moliere, the unrivalled maſter of the French comie theatre, who has written admirably both in proſe and rhyme, is, I think, moſt admirable, and moſt truly comic, when he adheres to the latter.</p>
               <p>To the author who attempts a comedy in Engliſh rhyme, our language ſeems to offer an advantage, which the French poet did not enjoy. The Comic Muſe of France has chiefly confined herſelf to that ſtructure of verſe, which belongs equally to her Tragic Siſter. In the poetry of our nation, this particular meaſure is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſportive ſubjects, and though hitherto not uſed in Comedy, it poſſeſſes to an Engliſh ear a very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic vivacity. That it is highly calculated for poems of wit and humour, we have a ſtriking proof in that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0310600105:174"/>
moſt exquiſite production the Bath Guide. How far it may ſucceed through the varied ſcenes of an Engliſh play, experiment only can determine. As ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, on the firſt ſight of a comedy in rhyme, may haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſuppoſe that the faſhion and the materials of the work are borrowed from the Theatre of France, I think it proper to declare, in juſtice to the writers of that country, that they are by no means anſwerable for any defects which may be found in theſe dramatic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. I am not conſcious of having borrowed a ſingle character or ſituation from any comic writer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, either foreign or domeſtic.—The firſt of the three comedies, contained in the preſent Publication, was founded on a real anecdote related to me by an intimate friend, who, concealing the names of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, mentioned their ludicrous adventure as a new and tempting ſubject for the Comic Muſe.—The plan of the ſecond aroſe in the mind of its author, from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the various effects of Connoiſſeurſhip in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent characters. An attachment to the fine arts, which is allowed to refine and ſtrengthen the virtues of a manly and a generous ſpirit, has perhaps a peculiar ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency not only to ſhew, but to increaſe the narrowneſs of a vain and feeble mind; and if ſuch a tendency exiſts, it is the province of a comic writer to counteract and correct it.—The aim of the third comedy in this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is to laugh at two diſtinct ſpecies of affectation,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0310600105:175"/>
very prevalent in our age and country; the affectation of refined ſentiment, and the affectation of pompous and pedantic expreſſion. I proteſt however againſt perſonal application: and, to guard againſt it, let me declare, that this ridicule is levelled, not at the great and reſpectable Veteran in the field of literature, whoſe phraſes may ſometimes be borrowed by a character in the play; but at the nameleſs and ſervile herd of his awkward imitators.—Vigor and originality of thought give a ſanction to the pomp and peculiarity of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. If ſingularities of ſtyle are united with genius and moral excellence, they are properly regarded with a partial reſpect; but when theſe ſingularities are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly copied, and ſeem to prevail as a faſhion, they become, I apprehend, very fair ſubjects of ſportive ſatire.</p>
               <p>When I reflect what long and eſtabliſhed prejudice a rhyming play muſt encounter—when I remember that even Dryden himſelf, the moſt able advocate, and the greateſt maſter of rhyme in our language, has expreſsly condemned the uſe of it in comedy—I am alarmed at the hardineſs of my attempt; but when I recollect that time, the moſt infallible teſt of literary opinion, has fully ſhewn the miſtake of that immortal Poet, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the uſe of rhyme in Engliſh Tragedy, I am inclined to hope that he might be equally miſtaken in ſuppoſing it utterly unſuited to our Comic Muſe. It may be urged indeed, with great truth, that a comedy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0310600105:176"/>
in rhyme cannot be ſo cloſe a copy of Nature as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in proſe, the latter adhering to the very language of common life. But from a ſiſter-art we may borrow, at leaſt a plauſible argument in favour of Poetry, on the preſent occaſion. The great maſter, who has deſcanted ſo happily on the principles of Painting, obſerves with great propriety, in one of his diſcourſes, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"we are not always pleaſed with the moſt abſolute poſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of an imitation to its original object: caſes may exiſt, in which ſuch a reſemblance may be even diſagreeable. I ſhall only obſerve, that the effect of figures in wax-work, though certainly a more exact repreſentation than can be given by painting or ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a ſufficient proof that the pleaſure we receive from imitation is not increaſed merely in proportion as it approaches to minute and detailed reality: we are pleaſed, on the contrary, by ſeeing ends anſwered by ſeeming inadequate means<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Joſhua Reynolds' Diſcourſe of December 1782.</note>."</q>—On theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which perhaps are equally juſt in the two kindred arts, a comedy in Rhyme may be ſtill more entertaining than a comedy, of equal merit in other points, which confines itſelf to proſe; and a critic who exclaims againſt the unnatural effect of a rhyming dialogue, may as juſtly cenſure a portrait on canvaſs, becauſe it is not ſo exact a copy of life, as an image of coloured wax. In both caſes, the artiſt, whether painter or poet, may be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0310600105:177"/>
juſtly called a true and a pleaſing copier of Nature, if he preſerves as high a degree of reſemblance, as his mode of imitation will admit, and embelliſhes his work with the attractive and almoſt indiſpenſable graces of eaſe, ſpirit, and freedom.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by Voltaire of theatrical compoſition in general, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Tous les genres ſont bons hors le genre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuyeux."</q> If the preſent comedies fall not within the claſs which that lively Writer has ſo juſtly proſcribed, the Author may be allowed to hope, that his liberal and enlightened readers will look with indulgence on a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, which aroſe from his wiſh to introduce a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he truſts not a blamable, variety into the amuſements of Engliſh literature.</p>

                        <l>I lately have loſt a poor good-humour'd friend.</l>
                        <l>You remember Jack Dangle at College, no doubt;</l>
                        <l>He was juſt of your age, and a little more ſtout;</l>
                        <l>He, with other young ſages, left Weſtminſter Hall</l>
                        <l>To teach Engliſh law to the ſlaves of Bengal.</l>
                        <l>But Jack, in his new chamber-practice at leaſt,</l>
                        <l>Too eagerly follow'd the rules of the Eaſt.</l>
                        <l>A bad cough enſu'd, much like yours in its ſound— <stage>(Deciſive <hi>coughs.)</hi>

                        <l>'Tis his tone ſo exactly, ſepulchral and hollow!</l>
                        <l>The ſyſtem he ſlighted I hope you will follow.</l>
                        <l>With pains in his breaſt he was ſharply tormented;</l>
                        <l>But as he at firſt to my guidance conſented,</l>
                        <l>Some time my ſtrict regimen kept him alive,</l>
                        <l>Poor Dangle once more was beginning to thrive;</l>
                        <l>And had he ſome months in my plan perſever'd,</l>
                        <l>On the earth at this moment he might have appear'd;</l>

But chance threw a pretty white girl in his way,</l>
                        <l>And eager for marriage, fond Jack would not ſtay:</l>
                        <l>In vain I conjur'd him to wait half a year,</l>
                        <l>And ſhew'd him the danger he ran very clear.</l>
                        <l>He thought the remains of his cough but a trifle,</l>
                        <l>And, being unable his paſſion to ſtifle,</l>
                        <l>He took his fair wife;—but, alas! the vile cough</l>
