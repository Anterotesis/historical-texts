            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the following
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> was finiſh'd
and ready for the
<hi>Preſs,</hi> I conſider'd to
what <hi>Biſhop</hi> the <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of it would be moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
(for I am reſolv'd that none
but <hi>Biſhops</hi> as yet ſhall have the
Honour of my <hi>Dedications</hi>;) and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1207700600:3"/>
I had not long ponder'd upon the
Matter, before I hit upon your
<hi>Lordſhip,</hi> who muſt needs be pleas'd
with this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> becauſe of the
Advantage, that you, as well as
myſelf, in the End, will reap by it.</p>
            <p>By Virtue of your <hi>Profeſſorſhip</hi>
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> you, <hi>My Lord,</hi> are a
<hi>Moderator</hi> at theological Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as I am here: And whether
the Execution of your Office be
as troubleſome as mine is, I know
not: But if the Deſign of this
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> take Place, we ſhall find
that modern Controverſies about
Religion are all vain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
be <hi>both</hi> of us ſoon eas'd of
the Trouble of our <hi>Moderations</hi> at
them.</p>
            <p>It may be, <hi>my Lord,</hi> you are not
ſo weary of your <hi>Moderatorſhip,</hi>
as I am: Beſides, that you are
better paid for your Pains, your
Diſputants are more amicable, and
in the midſt of their Diſputes more
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1207700600:4"/>
tractable: Tho they may warmly
contend, at the preſent, for and
againſt the Point in Debate; yet
like <hi>Lawyers</hi> who are no leſs zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for their <hi>Clients</hi> in the Day,
they commonly agree to drink a
Bottle together at Night, and go
to Bed, good Friends. And this
is very well done of them.</p>
            <p>But my Diſputants, <hi>my Lord,</hi>
call'd <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> at whoſe
Controverſy I have the Trouble,
by the Appointment of the Fathers,
to preſide, are more ſtubborn, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
and refractory. What ill
Treatment they would give each
other, if it was in their Power, I
know not: But my <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> ſince
they can't be aveng'd on their
Adverſarys, are full of Reſentment
againſt their <hi>Moderator,</hi> becauſe I
am not altogether partial to their
ſide; and how I ſhall eſcape their
Indignation, God alone knows.</p>

Whatever the <hi>Clergy, my Lord,</hi>
whom I dignify with the Title of
<hi>Apoſtates,</hi> may think, I look upon
myſelf as a notable <hi>Moderator</hi> of the
Controverſy; I have ſhewn them
all the Favour I can in it, and would
have brought them off with Honor,
but for a <hi>little Flaw,</hi> here diſcover'd,
in the Foundation of their Church,
which, for the Determination of
our Diſputes, muſt be confefs'd and
granted.</p>
            <p>If your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> upon reading
this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> ſhould be of the
ſame Mind with me, I beg of you
to Stroak the <hi>Clergy</hi> into Temper,
Patience and Compliance; Tell
them, they have been long ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
and glorious Victors over <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
and that it would be now an
Act of Generoſity to yield to them
in a <hi>ſmall Point</hi>; upon which ſuch
a Pacification would enſue, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

diſſolve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1207700600:8"/>
But I have another Favour, <hi>my

you wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d be pleas'd to perſuade
my old Friend the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi>

            <p>If your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will do me that
Favour, then I will do you as good
a Turn; and praiſe you for your
Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi>
preach'd at the Coronation: Tho
many may laugh at your Revival
of that Doctrine, Saying, the <hi>Clergy</hi>
upon an Occaſion, which our moſt
excellent <hi>Sovereign</hi> will never give
them, would again have Recourſe to
their <hi>Reſerves</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions</hi>; yet
I ſay it was well done of your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
to preach it, that the Tongues
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1207700600:9"/>
and the Hands (to Say nothing of
the Hearts) of the <hi>Clergy</hi> might go
together in Subſcriptions to <hi>Articles</hi>
and <hi>Homilys</hi>; and ſo avoid that
Prevarication and Inconſiſtency,
which ſome now have no more Wit
than to charge them with.</p>
            <p>So not queſtioning your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s
Approbation of this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE goes my ſixth and
laſt <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>;
the Subject whereof
is the literal Story of his
own Reſurrection; which,
according to the Propoſition
in hand, I am to ſhow to conſiſt of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditys,
Improbabilitys and Incredibilitys.
And I hope our <hi>Biſhops</hi> will quietly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Publication of this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1207700600:11"/>
if I aſſure them, that I mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worſe by it, than to make way for
the Underſtanding, what the Fathers write
of, the myſtical Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> out
of the Grave of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets;, of which myſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of our <hi>ſpiritual Jeſus,</hi> the
Evangelical Story of the Reſurrection of a
<hi>carnal Chriſt</hi> is but mere Type and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
            <p>I am ſo far from deſigning any Service
to Infidelity by this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> that I aim
at the Accompliſhment of ſome of St.
<hi>John</hi>'s Apocalyptical Viſions. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſay that a <hi>Church,</hi> built on the
Letter of the Scriptures, particularly on
the Letter of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles, is <hi>Babylon</hi>;
and that antiliteral Arguments and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Interpretations will be the downfal
of her. Whether there is any Truth in
this Opinion of the Fathers, I am minded
to make the Experiment; and tho I ſhould
bring the old Houſe of the Church over
my Head, and be cruſh'd to Pieces in its
Ruins, I can't forbear it: But however,
I would adviſe the <hi>Clergy</hi> to make haſte
and <hi>come out of Babylon,</hi> for fear of the
worſt; or they, who upon the Authority
of the Fathers are <hi>the Merchants of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
will <hi>weep</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Revelations Ch. xviii. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and mourn</hi> upon her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1207700600:12"/>
Fall, becauſe <hi>none will buy their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize</hi>
of the Letter <hi>any more.</hi> Dear
<hi>Jeſu,</hi> that ſuch a <hi>Student,</hi> as I am, in the
<hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> and an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of them too upon the Authority of
the Fathers ſhould be charg'd with Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
and Infidelity!</p>
            <p>So to Work I went; and I had not
been long muſing by myſelf, how to ſap
this Foundation of the Church, before I
was ſenſible of my own Inſufficiency for
it. Whereupon I ſent to my old Friend,
the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbi,</hi> for his Thoughts on this
grand Miracle of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection,
which he gave me ſome Promiſe of But
I deſired him to forbear all Ludicrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Satire and Banter for fear of Offence:
For tho our <hi>Clergy</hi> liked Volumes of Jeſts
and Facetiouſneſs, if they were diſcharg'd
againſt <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi>; yet
when they were levell'd at <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
the <hi>Letter</hi> the <hi>Caſe was alter'd,</hi> as quoth
<hi>Plowden,</hi> and they were not to be born
with. Therefore he was to remember
that decency, ſeriouſneſs and calmneſs of
Argument, required by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
               <note n="2" place="bottom">In his Paſtoral Letter, p. 35.</note> or I durſt not print it.</p>
            <p>In Compliance with my Deſires he ſent
me the following Letter, which, having

purg'd it of a few <hi>Puns</hi> and <hi>Cunundrums,</hi>

and it runs thus.</p>

of your <hi>Jeſus</hi>; ſo by my Conſent, we'll
now reduce the Controverſy to a narrow

diſcern'd it to be the moſt notorious and
monſtrous Impoſture, that ever was put
upon Mankind. And if you pleaſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to my following Arguments, which
require no depth of Judgment and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to apprehend, I am perſuaded that you
and every one diſintereſted, will be of the
ſame Mind too.</p>
                  <p>To overthrow and confute the Story of
this monſtrous and incredible Miracle, I was
thinking once to premiſe an Argument of the
Juſtice of the Sentence denounc'd againſt
and executed upon <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was ſo far
from being the innocent Perſon, you Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
would make of him, that, as may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be proved, he was ſo grand a <hi>Deceiver,</hi>
                     <hi>Impoſtor</hi> and <hi>Malefactor,</hi> as no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could be too great for him. But
this Argument (which I reſerve againſt
a Day of perfect Liberty, to publiſh by
itſelf in Defence of the Honour and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of our <hi>Anceſtors</hi>) would be too long
for the Compaſs of this Letter; and
therefore I paſs it by, tho it would give
Force to my following Objections; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hard and even impoſſible to imagine,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1207700600:15"/>
that God would vouchſafe the Favour of
a miraculous Reſurrection to one, who for
his Crimes deſervedly ſuffer'd and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
Death.</p>
                  <p>But waveing, I ſay, that Argument for
the preſent, which of itſelf would be
enough to prejudice a reaſonable Man
againſt the Belief of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection;
I will allow <hi>Jeſus</hi> to have been a much
better Man, than I believe him to have
been; or as good a one in Morals as your
Divines do ſuppoſe him; and will only
conſider the Circumſtances of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Story of his Reſurrection; from
which, if I don't prove it to have been the
moſt bare-fac'd Impoſture that ever was
put upon the World, I deſerve for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of this Attempt a much worſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
than he for his Frauds endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes wonder'd, conſidering
the Nature and Heinouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Faults, for which he dy'd, that our <hi>Chief
Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had any regard to his
Prediction (which was ſo like a Bambou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zlement
of the Populace) that he was to riſe
again the <hi>third Day</hi> after his Crucifixion.
There's no other Nation in the World,
which would not have ſlighted ſuch a vain
Prognoſtication of a known Impoſtor.
Let him foretel with ever ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1207700600:16"/>
his ſpeedy return to Life, I dare
ſay, any other Magiſtrates of ordinary Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
would have deſpiſed him for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
<hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi>: But, when I reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the Impoſture of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and of what pernicious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it had like to have proved to the
Peace and Welfare of our Nation, if it
had not been happily diſcover'd, my
Wonder here ceas'd; and I as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
now the Wiſdom, Caution and
Circumſpection of our <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> againſt
all poſſible Fraud and Deceit in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Tho <hi>Jeſus</hi>
himſelf, the Head of the Confederacy, and
prime Projector of the deſign'd Cheat in
the Caſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was cut off, yet his
Aſſociates were ſtill numerous; and it was
not impoſſible, but they might concert a
Project of a counterfeited Reſurrection of
him, in Accompliſhment of his Prophecy,
that might be of more fatal Conſequence,
and tend to ſuch Confuſions and Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among the People, as would not be
ſoon quell'd and quieted. Whereupon our
<hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> very prudently conſider of
Precautions againſt Cheat here, and wiſely
make Application to <hi>Pilat</hi> the <hi>Governor,</hi>
that proper and effectual Meaſures may be
taken againſt a falſe and feign'd Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for Fear of the ill Effects of it.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1207700600:17"/>

It is not that we are at all apprehenſive
of ſuch a wonderful and miraculous

                  <p>Whether <hi>Pilat</hi> was at all intent on the
Prevention of Fraud in this Caſe, or would
not willingly have connived at it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Diviſions and Diſtractions of our
then unhappy Nation, may be queſtion'd:
But the Requeſt of our <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> was
ſo reaſonable, and their Importunitys ſo
urgent, that he could not reſiſt them; and
therefore order'd them a <hi>Watch</hi> for the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1207700600:19"/>
Sepulchre, which they might make as
ſure, as they could, againſt Fraud and
Impoſture, till the <hi>third Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon our <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> deliberate,
what meaſures were fitteſt to be taken to
this Purpoſe. And as I can't, and don't
believe any Man elſe can, deviſe any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the ſecurity of the Sepulchre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Fraud, than what they took; ſo I
admire and applaud their Prudence, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,
and Precaution in the Caſe.
They <hi>ſeal'd the Stone</hi> at the mouth of the
Sepulchre, and placed a Guard of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
about it; which were <hi>Two</hi> ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
means for the Prevention or Detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cheat in a Reſurrection, as are
not to be equall'd by any other.</p>
                  <p>They <hi>ſeal'd the Stone</hi> of the Sepulchre,
which, tho it was no Security at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Violence, yet was an abſolute one
againſt Fraud. How the <hi>Stone</hi> which fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Mouth of the Sepulchre, as a Door
do's the Entrance into a Room, was ſeal'd,
I need not deſcribe. The uſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſealing of Doors of Cloſets, of
Cheſts, and of Papers is common; and
as it is an obvious Expedient, for the
Satisfaction of the Signators, againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
ſo it has been an antient as well as
a modern Practice. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> 
                     <note n="3" place="bottom">Daniel. Cap. vi. 17.</note>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1207700600:20"/>
ſeal'd the Door of the Den of Lions
wherein <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt, with his own
Signet: And wherefore did He ſo? For
the Satisfaction of himſelf and of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
when he came again to open and
compare the Signature with his Signet,
that no Art nor Artifice hid been uſed for
the Preſervation of <hi>Daniel.</hi> So our <hi>Chief
Prieſts</hi> ſeal'd the Stone of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
which they deſign'd to be preſent at
the opening of, on the <hi>third Day,</hi> the
Time appointed by <hi>Jeſus</hi> for his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and then give ample Satisfaction
to the People, that there was a real or
could be no Reſurrection of his Body.
Wherefore elſe did they <hi>ſeal</hi> the Stone of
his Sepulchre?</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Grotius</hi> 
                     <note n="4" place="bottom">Adducor ut credam Pilati Annulo et hunc Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſignatum. <hi>In Loc. Matt.</hi>
                     </note> thinks, that <hi>Pilat</hi>'s
Seal was affix'd to the Stone of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre;
but, as I believe, <hi>Pilat</hi> little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
himſelf about the Prevention of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
here; ſo I much queſtion it. It is
more reaſonable to think that the <hi>Chief
Prieſts</hi> and other Civil Magiſtrates of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
with their ſeveral Seals, which
could not be open'd but by themſelves
without ſuſpicion of Fraud, ſign'd the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1207700600:21"/>
Stone, and intended to be preſent, on the
Day appointed, at the opening of the
Sepulchre; not doubting, what no body
could queſtion, but <hi>Jeſus</hi> would wait their
coming, and ariſe to Life if he could, in
the ſight of themſelves, and of a vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of People, that were ſure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on them to behold the Miracle. Such
a Reſurrection would have been of Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the whole Nation; and ſuch a
Reſurrection, reaſonably ſpeaking, <hi>Jeſus</hi>
would, if he could, have vouchſafed in
Accommodation to the <hi>ſealing</hi> of the
<hi>Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding this Precaution,
in ſealing of the Stone, the beſt that could
be taken againſt Fraud, <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Body
was privately ſlipt off, early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Day before, and a Reſurrection
pretended by his Diſciples; and you
would have us and our Anceſtors to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
there was no Deceit in the Caſe;
tho confeſſedly none of the <hi>Sealers</hi> of
the Sepulchre were preſent: Who can
believe it? Was or can there be any
Impoſture more againſt: Senſe and Reaſon
palm'd upon the Underſtandings of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
If there had been a real Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the <hi>Sealers</hi> of the <hi>Stone</hi> would have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1207700600:22"/>
been the <hi>Openers</hi> of the Sepulchre; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
elſe was the <hi>Stone ſeal'd</hi>?</p>
                  <p>A Queſtion, that here ariſes, is, On
what Day and what Time of the Day,
did our <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> the Sealers of the
Stone, expect, what they could not think
would ever come to paſs, <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
Or what was the Extent of the
Time meant by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he ſaid that
after <hi>three Days,</hi> or on the <hi>third Day</hi> after
his Paſſion, he ſhould riſe again? if any
Impoſtor or Prophet like <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould in
this Age ſo predict his Reſurrection, and
be executed on a <hi>Fryday,</hi> the Day for his
Reſurrection would be preſumed to be
<hi>Monday,</hi> and not <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning before
Day. And I humbly conceive former
Ages and Nations, and our Nation in
particular did compute after this Faſhion.
Accordingly on <hi>Monday</hi> our <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi>
I don't doubt, intended to be preſent at
the opening of the Seals of the Sepulchre,
and to behold the Miracle: But <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Body was clandeſtinely moved off early
on <hi>Sunday,</hi> (the Day before <hi>that</hi> ſignified
and predicted for his Reſurrection) to the
Laughter more than to the ſurprize of our
Anceſtors, at the Notoriety of the Fraud
committed, and at the Vanity of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
pretended upon it. And I may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1207700600:23"/>
appeal, even to your <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> of the
Church, whether here's not another Note
of Cheat and Impoſture; and whether
the Diſciples were not afraid to truſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Body, it's full time, in the Grave;
becauſe of the greater Difficulty to carry
it off afterwards, and pretend a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
upon it.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe your <hi>Divines</hi> (who have
ſingular Knacks at making two Nights and
a full Day, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was buried, to be
<hi>three Days</hi> and <hi>three Nights</hi>; and whoſe
various Ways of Computation I always ſmile
at) do aſſert that <hi>Sunday</hi> was the <hi>third Day,</hi>
on which, in Accompliſhment of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s
Prophecy, and of his own Prediction, he
was to riſe again; I will ſuppoſe ſo with
them, and will, if they pleaſe, grant that
our <hi>Chief Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Sealers</hi> of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
expected his Reſurrection on that Day,
and intended, for the opening of the Seals,
to be preſent at it.</p>
                  <p>But at what Time of Day were they
to come or could be expected at the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre?
Not long before Noon. But
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Body was gone betimes in the
Morning, before our <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> could
be out of their Beds; and a barefaced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringment
of the Seals of the Sepulchre was
made againſt the Laws of Honour and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1207700600:24"/>
Honeſty, and a Reſurrection confidently
talk'd of by the Diſciples; and yet your
Chriſtian Prieſthood at this Day would
have us to believe, there was no Fraud
and Deceit in all this! O moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous!</p>
                  <p>If our <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> had treſpaſs'd upon
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Patience, and would not attend at
the Sepulchre for the opening of the Seals,
on the Day and Time appointed; if they
hid been for confining him longer in the
Grave than was meet, according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
then his Reſurrection, without their
Preſence, had been excuſable and juſtifiable.
But this his pretended Riſing to Life,
not only a Day before the Chief Prieſts
could imagine he would, or earlier in the
Morning than he ſhould, for the Sake of
their requiſite Preſence, is, together with
the Fracture of the Seals againſt the Law
of Security, ſuch a manifeſt and indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Mark and Indication of Fraud, as is
not to be equall'd in all or any of the
Impoſtures, that ever were attempted to be
put upon the World.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, by the Sealing of the Stone
of the Sepulchre we are to underſtand
nothing leſs than a Covenant enterd into,
between our <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
by which <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Veracity, Power and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1207700600:25"/>
                     <hi>Meſſiahſhip</hi> was to be try'd. Tho we read
not of the Apoſtles giving their Conſent to
the Covenant, yet it was reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
and could not have been refus'd, if
ask'd. The Condition of the ſeal'd Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was, that if <hi>Jeſus</hi> aroſe from the dead
in the Preſence of our <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> upon
their opening the Seals of the Sepulchre,
at the Time appointed; then was he to be
acknowledg'd to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>: But if he
continued in a corrupt and putrified ſtate
of Mortality, then was he to be granted
to be an <hi>Impoſtor</hi>: Very wiſely and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed! And if the Apoſtles had ſtood
to this Covenant, Chriſtianity had been
nipt in its Bud, and ſuppreſs'd in its Birth.
But they had other Views and another
Game to play at all Adventures. The
Body was to be removed and a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
pretended to the Deluſion, it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibe,
of all Mankind, in which they have
been more ſucceſsful than could be imagin'd
upon a Project that had ſo little Senſe or
Reaſon, ſo little Colour of Truth or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Contrivance and Execution of
it. Our <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> were apprehenſive
at firſt of their ſtealing the Body away,
and pretending a Reſurrection: Bat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>ſealing</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> thoſe fears
vaniſh'd; becauſe upon the ſtealing the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1207700600:26"/>
Body, away againſt ſuch ſecurity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
the Fraud would be felf evident,
and want no Demonſtration and Proof of
it. Bur, for all this Precaution, I ſay, the
Body was in a barefaced Manner taken
away, a Reſurrection talk'd of, and to the
Amazement of every one, who can think
freely, has been beleived thro' all Ages
of the Church ſince. Upon the whole
then, I think, you may as well ſay, when
a ſeal'd Cloſet is broken open, and the
Treaſure gone without the Privity of the
Signators, that there's no wrong done; as
that in the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> there
was no Fraud. The Caſes are equal and
parallel. What then can your Chriſtian,
<hi>Prieſts</hi> ſay to this demonſtrative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a manifeſt and bare-faced Cheat
in <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection? I have been
thinking, what they will or can ſay;
and upon the matureſt Consideration I
don't find they can make any other than
one or more of theſe ſhuffling Anſwers to
it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That it was impoſſible for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to Steal the Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> away,
becauſe of the Watchfulneſs of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho the <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi>
of Sepulchre were not preſent at it.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1207700600:27"/>2. That tho the <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of the ſtone of the Sepulchre were
not preſenr, as I ſay they ought to
have been, to behold the Miracle; yet
his Reſurrection was afterwards made as
manifeſt to them, as if they had been
there preſent.</item>
                        <item>3. That if <hi>Jeſus</hi> did not really ariſe
from the dead, the Beleif of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
could never have been ſo propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at firſt, nor would have been retain'd
in the World for ſo many Ages ſince.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can think of no other Anſwers, and
believe it impoſſible for your Chriſtian
<hi>Prieſts</hi> to form any other, to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Argument of Fraud in <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:
But how weak, frivolous and
inſufficient they all and every one are,
will appear upon a little Examination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, againſt the foreſaid demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative
Argument of Fraud, it may be
pretended, <hi>That it was impoſſible for the
Diſciples to ſteal the Body of</hi> Jeſus <hi>away,
becauſe of the Watchfulneſs of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho the</hi> Cheif Prieſts, <hi>the</hi> Sealers <hi>of
the Sepulchre were not preſent at it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1207700600:28"/>
To which I reply, and confeſs, that if
it was impoſſible to evade the Guards of
the Sepulchre, then there was a real Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
but if there was but a bare Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of evading them, then this Anſwer
is of no Force. And I am of Opinion,
that the Thing was not only poſſible,
but eaſy, feaſſible, and practicable. Tho
the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were of as much Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and Integrity as any of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
yet it is well known, that ſuch
Creatures are ſubject to Bribery and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
if the Diſciples had any Money
to tempt them with: Or if their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to their Truſt was untainted;
yet it is not improbable, but their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
at the Direction of <hi>Pilat,</hi> who found
his Account in the Diſtractions of our
Nation, might give them the Hint to wink
hard, at the Commiſſion of ſuch a Fraud.
But not to inſiſt on either of theſe Ways
to evade the <hi>Watch</hi>; our Anceſtors ſaid,
what your <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> has recorded, that
the Diſciples, taking the opportunity
of the ſleep of the Guards, carry'd the
Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> off; which was a thing
both poſſible and probable.</p>
                  <p>Of what Number the <hi>Watch</hi> did conſiſt
is uncertain. Your <hi>Whitly</hi> 
                     <note n="5" place="bottom">Upon the Place in <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </note> ſays they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1207700600:29"/>
were <hi>ſixty</hi>; but he has no Reaſon nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to think, they were ſo many. If
they had been to be a Guard againſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
I ſhould eaſily have believed they
were more; but in as much as they were
only a <hi>Watch</hi> againſt Fraud, and againſt any
caſual defaceing of the <hi>Seals</hi> on the Stone,
before the <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> came to open the
Sepulchre, <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Soldiers were
ſufficient, and I don't think, there were
any more ſet to this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>It is not then at all improbable, that ſo
few Soldiers ſhould be faſt aſleep at that
time of Night, or ſo early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when the clandeſtine Work was done;
eſpecially after keeping ſuch a <hi>Gaudy day,</hi>
as was the Feaſt of the Paſſover, which,
like the Feſtivals of other Nations, was
celebrated with Exceſs. Foot Soldiers
then, you may be ſure, upon the Bounty
of one or other did no more want, than
they would ſcruple to take their <hi>Fill,</hi>
which like an Opiat lock'd up their Senſes
for that Night, when the Diſciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aware of the lucky opportunity, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
the Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> off ſafely.</p>
                  <p>And where's the Abſurdity to ſuppoſe,
that the Diſciples themſelves might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the Intoxication of the Guards?
<hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us a Story of a dead-Body's
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1207700600:30"/>
being ſtolen away by ſuch an
Artifice. And I don't think the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> either ſo fooliſh or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
as not to take the Hint and
enterpriſe the like Fraud. <hi>Peter,</hi> who
upon occaſion, could <hi>ſwear</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi>
like a <hi>Trooper,</hi> would hardly ſcruple to
fuddle a few <hi>Foot-Soldiers.</hi> But which
way ſoever it came to paſs, the
Watch were aſleep, which is neither hard
to conceive nor believe; and then the
Diſciples executed <hi>that</hi> Fraud, which has
been the Deluſion of Nations and Ages
ſince.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> would hint that the
<hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> gave Money to the Soldiers
to ſay, they were aſleep, when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
ſtole the Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> away,
as if they were brib'd to a falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
but there neither was nor could
be any ſuch Thing. If there had been a
real Reſurrection to their Aſtoniſhment
and Amazement, as it is repreſented in
your Goſpels, no Money could ſo ſoon
have corrupted them to a falſe Witneſs,
being under ſuch Fears of God and of
<hi>Jeſus.</hi> I don't doubt but our <hi>Cheif
Prieſts</hi> might reward the Soldiers for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth, and exhort them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in it, with a Promiſe to <hi>ſecure</hi> them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1207700600:31"/>
againſt the Anger of <hi>Pilat</hi> for their ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and neglect of their Duty.</p>
                  <p>Here then is no <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the foreſaid
Argument or Objection againſt <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Reſurrection. It was not at all impoſſible
for the Diſciples, who ſtole the Body
away, to avoid the Guards, who were
and may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be
lull'd aſleep, when the Diſciples did it.
Neither is there any more Force in the</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Second Anſwer to it, <hi>viz. That
tho the Cheif Prieſts, the ſealers of the
Stone of ths Sepulchre, were not preſent,
opening the Seals and beholding the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
yet his Reſurrection was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as manifeſt to them, as if they
had been there preſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ay, this is ſomewhat like an Anſwer, if
there be any Truth in it. A Manifeſtation
of <hi>Chriſt riſen</hi> afterwards to our <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi>
would have been equivalent to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at, and ſight of the Miracle. But
how was his Reſurrection manifeſted to
them? did <hi>Jeſus</hi> ever afterwards appear
perſonally to them, to their ſatisfaction,
that he was the ſame Perſon, whom they
crucified and put to Death for a Deceiver
and falſe Prophet? No; this is not once
aſſerted by your <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> or ever inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
by any antient or modern Writer.
How then was <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1207700600:32"/>
manifeſt to our Cheif Prieſts? Why; your
<hi>Divines</hi> ſay, what is all that can be ſaid
here, that the Words of the Diſciples, who,
being Men of Honeſty, Simplicity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
would not Lye, are to be taken
for it. Very fine indeed! our Cheif Prieſts
are to take the Words of the Diſciples for
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection, and look upon them
as Men of Veracity, when they knew and
experienc'd them to be grand Cheats, not
only in Stealing the Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> away,
but in the <hi>known Impoſture</hi> of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s
Reſurrection, or your <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> had never
implicitly called it ſo. When therefore
Deceivers will not be <hi>Lyers</hi>; nor Theives,
<hi>Diſſemblers</hi> of the Fact, they are accuſed of,
I will own <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection to have
been manifeſt enough to our <hi>Cheif Prieſts.</hi>
There's no Need of more Argument here;
He that beſtows more Words on it, loſes
Time.</p>
                  <p>It has been a Conſtant Objection of us
<hi>Jews</hi> againſt the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
that he appear'd not perſonally afterwards
to our <hi>Cheif Prieſts,</hi> to <hi>Pilat</hi> and to others
his Crucifiers and Inſultors, to upbraid
them with their Infidelity and ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him. Whether <hi>Jeſus</hi> would not
have done ſo, if he really aroſe from the
dead; and whether he ought not in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for the Conviction and Converſion of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1207700600:33"/>
Unbeleivers, to have done ſo, with me is
no Queſtion. <hi>Celſus</hi> of old <note n="6" place="bottom">Si Jeſus volebat revera declarare ſuam divinam Potentiam, debuerat ſuis Inſultatoribus, ipſi<expan>

have appeared to them, then I will turn
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> and grant that in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
above, which proves plain Fraud
in the Reſurrection, there's no Force nor
Truth. In the mean time <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Non-Appearance
to the <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
that he did not ariſe from the
Dead, bat that his Body was ſtolen away,
or he would have waited in the Grave,
the coming of the Sealers of the Stone,
and their regular opening of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
to the Conviction and Converſion
of all there preſent and Confirmation of
the Faith of all Ages and Nations ſince,
But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Anſwer to the foreſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Fraud in the Reſurrection of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> drawn from the Nature, Uſe and
Deſign of ſealing the Stone of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
is, <hi>that tho the</hi> Sealers <hi>of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
were not preſent, opening the Seals
and beholding the Miracle; yet</hi> Jeſus <hi>did
certainly ariſe from the Dead, or the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of his Reſurrecton could never have
been at firſt propagated by the Apoſtles,
nor would for ſo many Ages of the Church

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1207700600:35"/>
Here's as little Reaſon in this Anſwer
as in either of the two former. Who
knows not, that many Errors in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and as many Frauds in Religion have
been ſometimes accidentally, ſometimes
deſignedly eſpous'd and palm'd upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who in Proceſs of Time become ſo
wedded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> them thro' Prejudice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
that they will not give themſelves
Leave to enquire into the Riſe and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of them. Falſe Miracles have been
common Things among Chriſtians; and as
the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is their grand
and fundamental one, ſo it is not at all
difficult to account for the Riſe, Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and Continuance of the Belief of
it.</p>
                  <p>Why it has been believed thro' theſe
latter Ages of the Church, is no Wonder
at all. The Prieſts had their Intereſt in
it; the ignorant and ſuperſtitious had
their Comfort in it; and the wiſe and
considerate, for Fear of Perſection, durſt
not enquire into the Grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>The only difficulty here is to know,
upon what Principle, the Project and
Story of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection was at firſt
deviſed. And whether it was Ambition
or Revenge upon our ancient and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
Prieſthood, that prompted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to it, is all one to me. Such bad
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1207700600:36"/>
Principles too often put Men upon deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Attempts. But however, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture
it was, for the Argument above.
To ſay, the Apoſtles and Confederates
in the Fraud would not have ſtood to it,
and have dy'd for it, if the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had not been real Fact, ſignifies
nothing. Many Cheats and Criminals,
beſides them, have aſſerted their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and deny'd their Guilt in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
exrremity of Death, without the like
Views of Honour and Fame. The only
Thing, that's ſurpriſing and aſtoniſhing
in this Sham-Miracle, is that, tho it
was the moſt manifeſt, the moſt bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
and the moſt ſelf evident Impoſture
that ever was put upon the World; yet
it has been the moſt fortunate and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
having paſt thro' many Ages and
Nations with Reputation and Renown;
and might have continued for as many
Generations to come, but for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
above, that perfectly and clearly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows
its Credit.</p>
                  <p>But, ſome may ſay here, where was
the Wiſdom and Providence of God, all
this while, to ſuffer ſo many Ages and
Nations to labour under ſuch a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
Why, I'll tell you; The Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God in it was, "To humble
Mankind, in the End, for their vain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1207700600:37"/>
Oſtentation of Wiſdom, Learning and
<hi>Science falſly ſo call'd</hi>; "To ſhame
them for their Madneſs and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to perſecute one another for different
Opinions in that Religion, whoſe very
Foundation is falſe and groundleſs;
"To caution them againſt a blind and
implicit Faith for the future; againſt
believing any thing out of the ſight and
reach of their Underſtandings; "To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
them of the neceſſity of Liberty
to think, ſpeak and write freely about
Religion, for the Correction of Errors
and Diſcovery of Truth; and laſtly,
"To reduce the World when it ſhould be
ripe for it, to the golden Religion of
Nature, which upon the Teſtimony of our
old <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> Doctors, and of your <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
himſelf, is the <hi>End of the Law and
the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus have I ſpoken to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi>
which your <hi>Chriſtian Prieſthood</hi>
may be preſumed to make, to the foreſaid
Argument of Fraud in <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
drawn from the Deſign of our
<hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> in ſealing of the Stone of
his Sepulchre. I ſhould not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
myſelf to ſpeak to theſe their
ſuppoſed <hi>Anſwers,</hi> but to ſave them the
Trouble of making; them, and the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1207700600:38"/>
As to the Stories, in your <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi>
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s ſeveral Appearances after his
pretended Reſurrection, ſometimes to the
Women, and at other Times to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
I am not at all obliged to refute
them. If theſe Appearances had been
more frequent, better circumſtanced, and
more ſolemnly averr'd, they would have
wanted no Confutation. There's no doubt
on't, but the Diſciples, who, for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
above, unqueſtionably ſtole <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Body away, in order to pretend a
Reſurrection, would talk much of his
appearing to them, and of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
afterwards, they had with him.
And if they had told better and more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Tales of their fight of, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
with him, it would be nothing to
the Purpoſe; <hi>better,</hi> I ſay, <hi>and more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Tales</hi> than thoſe upon Record, which
for Abſurdity, Nonſenſe and Incoherence
carry their own Confutation along with

needs think it, if he cloſely think on't,
like ſome of the confuſed and incredible
womaniſh Fables of the Apparitions of the
Ghoſts of deceaſed Perſons, which the
Chriſtian World in particular has in former
Ages abounded with. The Ghoſts of the
Dead in this preſent Age, and eſpecially
in this Proteſtant Country have ceas'd to
appear; and we now-a-days hardly ever
hear of ſuch an Apparition: And what is
the Reaſon of it? Why, the Beleif of theſe
Storys being baniſh'd out of Men's Minds,
the crafty and vaporous forbear to trump
them upon us. There has been ſo much
clear Proof of Fraud in many of theſe
Storys, that the wiſe and conſiderate Part
of Mankind has rejected them all, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>this</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which to Admiration

Appearances after Death had hardly
eſcaped the Fate of other Apparitions;
nay, would have been rejected, one of the

But however, 1 can't read the Story with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

your <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> wanted Wit to adapt
their Tale to Senſe, and to accommodate
the Tranſaction to Nature; and ſometimes
I think them crafty, and were minded,
like <hi>Daniel de Foe</hi> in his foreſaid <hi>Romance,</hi>
to put the Banter upon the Credulity of
Mankind, with ſome diſguiſed and latent
Abſurdities, that, in the Concluſion and

at for the Belief of them, I dare not,
I ſay, ſo much a hint at one of theſe
Abſurdities, leaſt I ſhould be unwarily
tempted to crack a Jeſt on it. But the
Time, I hope, is coining, when I ſhall
uſe more Freedom. And ſhould your

Prieſthood, in Proof of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
urge any of theſe Storys of his

                  <p>In the mean time I depend on the

of Fraud in this grand Miracle,
which I found on the Nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of ſealing the Sepulchre; and for
Confirmation of my Opinion and Proof
of Fraud in it, will conclude this Letter
with a parallel Caſe and Story, Not
many Years ſince, one Dr. <hi>Emms,</hi> of the
Society of the French Prophets, who in
their Inſpirations were, like <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his
Diſciples of old, Declaimers againſt the
Phariſaical Prieſthood of this Age, did by
himſelf, or ſome of his Fraternity did for
him, predict his Reſurrection on a certain
Day, when there was a Concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
about his Grave in vain to behold
the Miracle, as there would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Sepulchre, if he had lain
in it, his full Time. But ſuppoſing in
this Caſe, that the Magiſtrates and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of this City, to prevent a Cheat and
Deluſion of the People, had interred the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1207700600:42"/>
                     <hi>Doctor</hi> in a Chnrch-Vault, and ſeal'd the

or Deceit be uſed: This would
have been a wiſe Precaution againſt Fraud,
as was in the Caſe of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But what
if his Fraternity, having a Mind, like <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Diſciples to bambouzle the People
and Prieſthood, had, ſome of them drawn
the Watch aſide to a <hi>Gin-ſhop,</hi> whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
carry'd the Body off, pretending a
Reſurrection? What would all reaſonable
Men have ſaid here? That it was an
impudent and bare-faced Impoſture. But
to carry on the Farce; ſuppoſing, the
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s Fraternity had afterwards averr'd
that they had ſeen and convers'd with him
alive, ſeveral Times, as before his Death;
and had told particular Storys of their
Converſation with him; as <hi>firſt</hi> of all,
how he appear'd to ſome of their Women
(who were admoniſh'd of the Certainty of
his Reſurrection by a Youth or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
or two, they could not tell whether,
but they were as like to Angels, which
they never ſaw before in their Lives, as
Youths could be) who knew him, not by
his Countenance, for <hi>their Eyes were holden,</hi>
as by his Talk on Scripture-Prophecy,
which was his uſual Cant before his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1207700600:43"/>
Death. And at another Time he appear'd
to his old Acquaintance, who knew him,
not by the Features of his Face, but by
an habitual Motion and Action of his
Hand in <hi>breaking of Bread.</hi> And at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Time he was corporally preſent, but
<hi>they thought, they ſaw a Spirit.</hi> About
<hi>eight Days after that,</hi> he appear'd among
more of his old Friends, but for all their
former Intimacy with him, ſome of them
<hi>doubted</hi> whether it was the <hi>Doctor</hi> or
not. At another Time he came to them
in <hi>another Form</hi> and Shape, unlike to his
priſtin one, but they were ſure it was <hi>He</hi>
by his Expoſition of the Scripture. At
another Time, when they were aſſembled
together and the Doors were lock'd <hi>for
fear of the Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſlipt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
into their Company, either from
behind a Curtain, or miraculouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
at the Key-hold. And the laſt Time
he appear'd, there was one of his intimate
Friends had not known him, but by a
<hi>Sore</hi> in his Breaſt, which the Power of
God in his Reſurrection did not heal:
After which, they ſaid, he <hi>vaniſh'd away,</hi>
                     <hi>was taken up into Heaven,</hi> and they ſaw
him no more. Suppoſing, I ſay, the
<hi>French</hi> Prophets had told ſuch like Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys
of <hi>Doctor Emms</hi>'s Reſurrection, and
of his Appearances to them; what would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1207700600:44"/>
your Prieſts and all other wiſe Men have
ſaid to it? Why, that it was all idle
Tales, manifeſt Lyes, Sham, and lmpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that if the <hi>Doctor,</hi> in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Errors of your Prieſts, had
riſen to Life, God would have kept him
in his Sepulchre, his full time, and have
rais'd him in the Preſenee of Prieſts,
Magiſtrates and People; and that he
would have walk'd afterwards publickly
in the Streets without Danger, to the
Satisfaction of all, who knew him, that
he was the ſame <hi>Emms</hi> who died and
was bury'd: <hi>Without Danger,</hi> I ſay, from
the Populace, who would have been ſo
far from affronting him, that they would
have almoſt adored him for the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Favour, God had done him in his
Reſurrection from the dead; and that
he would never have skulk'd about and
abſconded himſelf for <hi>forty Days</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
before he was pretendedly tranſlated;
and therefore there was nothing but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Deceit and Impoſture in all theſe
Pretences.</p>
                  <p>I need not make the Application of this
Caſe and Story, which your <hi>Prieſts</hi> know
how to do for me. To ſay here, that
there's none would be ſo deſperate to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in ſuch a Fraud, as is the ſuppoſed
Caſe of Dr. <hi>Emms</hi> above, is a miſtake.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1207700600:45"/>
Many Thouſands for their Diverſion
would enterpriſe it; and the Storys of
the Apparitions of Ghoſts, which are
almoſt all the Frauds of the Crafty to
delude the ignorant, do prove it. I my
felf would be forward to concert ſuch an
Intrigue, if it was but to put the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to ruffle their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and ſecretly to laugh at them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would deter me from it, but fears
of the Civil Magiſtrate, which was not
the Danger of the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Pilat,</hi> for the ſake of Rule over
the <hi>Jews,</hi> was a Countenancer of every

muſt have continued thro' all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Fraud, before urg'd and argued.</p>
                  <p>Here, Sir, before I conclude this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I think it my Duty however to give
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1207700600:46"/>
you may Opinion of the Religion, that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Diſciples were for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
into the World. Tho I beleive,
what I have proved, his Reſurrection to
be a Piece of Fraud, and his other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to have been all Artifice; and tho
our <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> and ancient Nation are
juſtifiable in the Sentence, that was paſs'd
and executed upon <hi>Jeſus</hi>; yet I muſt
do him and his Diſciples the Juſtice, to
own, that the Doctrine they taught was
for the moſt Part of it, good, ufeful and
popular, being no other than the Law
and Religion of Nature, which, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being wearied with their own Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions,
and ſick of the Burthen of their
Prieſts, ran apace into. Accordingly one
 <note n="11" place="bottom">Juſtin Martyr. <hi>In Apol.</hi> ii.</note> of your ancient Fathers ſays, that
they <hi>who lived according to the Law of

needs ſay, that if Chriſtians, in Proceſs
of Time, had not ſophiſticated this primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; If they had not
built their ſyſtematical Divinity upon
him, and brought ſtrange Inventions of

not again ſubjugated and entangled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with another and worſe Yoke of

Prieſthood of the Church, the World
might have enjoy'd great Happineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Religion, even <hi>that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
which is now only to be expected
upon a Diſproof of his miraculous Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that has been the Foundation of a
moſt confuſed Superſtructure of wild
Doctrines and Opinions: Or more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeaking, <hi>That Happineſs</hi> of the ſtate
of Nature, Religion and Liberty, which
may be look'd for upon the coming of
our <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the allegorical Accompliſher
of the Law and the Prophets; whoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
upon the Tradition of our <hi>Cabaliſts,</hi>
will be toward the latter End of the
<hi>Sixth</hi> grand Age of the Creation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from our Faces and our Hearts the
Vail of the Letter; and in the mean
while I adhere to the umbratical Rites,
Ceremonies and way of Worſhip, derived
from our Forefathers.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, have I finiſh'd my <hi>Letter</hi> on
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection; and whether I hive
not ſaid enough to juſtify our <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Disbeleif of that Miracle, let your <hi>Cheif
Prieſts</hi> judge. I don't expect my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt it will be convincing of
any of your Preachers. They have a
potent Reaſon for their Faith, which
we <hi>Jews</hi> can't come at; or I don't know,
but we might believe with them.</p>

I truſt you'll meet with no Moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Publication of this <hi>Letter</hi>;
neither do I think, it was any thing of
mine, inſerted in your Diſcourſes, that
at any time brought Trouble on you.
It was your own Imprudence to rave,
as you do, againſt <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> What
need had you to talk of the Miſcheifs
and Inconveniences of an Hireling Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
What occaſion had you to call
them Eccleſiaſtical Virmin, and to ſpeak
of the Happineſs of Mankind upon their
Extinction? Theſe things are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking.
And here's the true Sourſe, in
my Opinion, of all your Troubles!</p>
                  <p>Tho I have here ſhewn, that <hi>Chriſt is
not riſen,</hi> yet I have more Wit than to
make the Inference of <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>their
Preaching is vain.</hi> Their Oratory is
ſtill uſeful, if it be but to tickle the Ears
and amuſe the Underſtandings of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
about Doctrines they underſtand not,
whether true or falſe. And ſuch an
order of Men, as are your Prieſtood, are,
by their Habit of long Robes, an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Society; and it is an Honour to
the Country to have them well fed and
clad. Had I Room for it, I could write a
curious <hi>Encomium</hi> in Priſe of them, and
tell the World of what Uſe and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
they have been, in all Ages. O
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1207700600:49"/>
what Wars and Perſecutions might have
been rais'd in the World, but for their
pacifick Tempers! How would Sin and
Immorality have broke in upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
like a Deluge, but for the Goodneſs
of their Lives and the Excellency of their
Precepts! How has the Increaſe and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of their warm Sermons been the
Ruin of <hi>Satan</hi>'s hot and divided Kingdom
of Darkneſs and Error! Its owing to
their Pains and Labours, that every Age,
for many paſt, has been improving in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
till the preſent, which for Piety and
good Morals is that Perfection of Time,
which is not to be meliorated but by the
Reſtitution of the golden Age.</p>
                  <p>So could I enlarge in Praiſe of your
<hi>Clergy</hi>; and ſo ſhould you have done;
and then you might have diſputed, as
you do, againſt any Doctrines, Miracles
and Articles of Faith, without Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Try, if you can't correct that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Error, you have committed.
Aſſert ſtill, if you can, with Dr. <hi>Rogers</hi>
the Neceſſity of an eſtabliſh'd Prieſthood,
well paid, for the Service of the <hi>King</hi> and
the Country, under all Changes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which may be a means to retrieve
their Favour, and will beget in me a

            <p>So ends the Letter of my Friend, the
<hi>Jewiſh Rabbi,</hi> in which to my Comfort,
he has conform'd himſelf to the Rules of
<hi>Sedateneſs, Decency</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
preſcrib'd by the two great <hi>Biſhops</hi>
of <hi>London</hi> and St. <hi>Davids.</hi> If the weight
and ſolidity of his Argument don't grieve
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> I am in no Pain for the Levity
and Ludicrouſneſs of if. And whether
the weight and nature of his Argument
againſt <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection will at all
ſtartle and ſurpriſe them, I know not;
but I profeſs for my ſelf, that I might
have ſtudy'd long enough for ſuch an
Argument againſt it, as this <hi>Rabbi,</hi> with
his great gray Beard, has preſently hit off.
He told me beforehand, that his Thoughts
on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection ſhould be out of
the common Road of thinking; and I
muſt needs ſay, he has been as good as
his Word, or no Man ever kept his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>There are two Things very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his Argument: The <hi>One</hi> is, the
Uſe and Deſign of ſealing the Stone of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Sepulchre, which he lays great
ſtreſs on, to the Proof of Fraud in his
Reſurrection; and the <hi>other</hi> is, his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of theſe Words, <hi>the laſt Error</hi> (or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1207700600:51"/>
as he reads Deceit or Impoſture) <hi>will be
worſt than the firſt</hi> or former, in which
he makes the <hi>Cheif Prieſts</hi> in their Speech
to <hi>Pilat,</hi> to refer to <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
as the former known Impoſture.
If his Application be juſt and true, the
Conſequence is that the Reſurrections of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> are both Impoſtures.
It grieves me to the Heart to think of
this Conſequence, which our <hi>Divines</hi> are
to ſee to, and evade, if they can. No
ſooner did I read his Application of the
foreſaid Words, but I run to our <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi>
for another and better Expoſition of
them: But alas! to my Sorrow, they
made nothing of them, but a ſort of a
<hi>proverbial Expreſſion,</hi> which the <hi>Cheif
Prieſts</hi> muſt have ſpoil'd and knock'd out
of Joint. Being then under great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Truth of Chriſtianity and the
Certainty of theſe two grand Miracles,
I refer the matter to our Learned <hi>Clergy,</hi>
deſiring them to be as ſpeedy as they
can in another and more proper Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the foreſaid Words, or <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Infidels</hi> will run away with them
in the <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s Senſe, to the Confutation
of our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>I conſider'd lately, tint <hi>Eaſter</hi> drew
nigh, when it was uſual for our <hi>Divines</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1207700600:52"/>
in their Pulpits, to inſiſt on the Proof of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection; and therefore I
I haſten'd the Publication of this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi>
that they might have theſe two
peculiar Texts, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>ſealing the Stone</hi>
of the Sepulchre, and of <hi>the laſt Error</hi> or
Impoſture <hi>will be worſe than the firſt,</hi> to
treat on. He that produces a Sermon or
Sermons, wreſting the foreſaid Texts out
of the Hands of my <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and putting
another Senſe on them, to the Credit of
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s and <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Reſurrection,
<q>Erit mihi magnus Apollo</q>
and by my Conſent ſhall be the next
<hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Heart akes a little for our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
and I almoſt deſpair of their clean
Solutions of the foreſaid two Difficultys.
What muſt they do then? Why, they
muſt give up their <hi>Religion</hi> as well as
their <hi>Church,</hi> or go along with me to
Fathers for their myſtical Interpretation
of the whole Story of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>That the Fathers, without queſtioning
their Belief of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s corporal Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
univerſally interpreted the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and every part of it myſtically, is

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1207700600:57"/>
of the ſtory of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection, but
what I have here ſaid in a few Citations,
is enough to ſhow, that they look'd upon
the whole Story, as emblematical of his
ſpiritual Reſurrection out of the <hi>Grave</hi>
of the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scriptures, in which
he has been bury'd about <hi>three Days</hi> and
<hi>three Nights,</hi> according to that myſtical
Interpretation of prophetical Numbers
which I have learn'd of them.</p>
            <p>And thus have I done with the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Reſurrection, which, by
the help of my Friend the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbi,</hi>
I have ſhown, according to the Letter, to
conſiſt of the greateſt Incredibilitys. And
with this I conclude my <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> on
his Miracles, intending to treat on no
more of them, unleſs I am invited or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to it. I had once an Inclination
to make another <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
miraculous Conception, and on his feeding
his Thouſands, in the Wilderneſs with a
few Loaves and Fiſhes; but upon a little
Conſideration on the Letter of thoſe two
Storys, I found myſelf too grave for the
Work; and my <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s Thoughts are too
gay and wonton; therefore it muſt be
omitted, till the <hi>Clergy</hi> importune me to
it, and ſignify their Curioſity to ſee it
perform'd by me.</p>

My Diſcourſes hereafter, if God ſpare
me Life and Liberty, which under his
Providence I don't deſpair of, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
another Volume, ſhall treat on ſome
hiſtorical Paſſages of the New Teſtament,
ſuch as, "On the Storys of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Birth;
and the Appearances of Angels to the
Shepherds keeping Watch over their Flocks
by Night; "The Journey and Preſents of
the Wiſe Men to <hi>Jeſus</hi>; The Slaughter

I am reſolv'd to give the Letter of the
Scripture no Reſt, ſo long as God gives me
Life and Abilities to attack it. <hi>Origen</hi>

here take Place of ſober Reaſoning, as
the more proper and effectual means to
cure Men of their fooliſh Faith and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
Notions. As no wiſe Man hardly
ever reprehends a Blunderbuſs for his
Bull, any other way, than by laughing
at him; ſo the Aſſerters of nonſenſical
Notions in Theology ſhould, if poſſible,
be ſatiriſed and jeſted upon, or they'll
never be put out of Countenance for,
nor deſert their abſurd Doctrines. And
there never was a Polemical Divine, that,
if he hid an opportunity and Advantage
over the Weakneſs of his Adverſary, did
not take ſuch a ludicrous and merry Courſe
with him.</p>
            <p>But on ſuch hiſtorical Paſſages of the
Goſpel as before mention'd, do I truſt to
publiſh another Volume of <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> like
to theſe on <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Miracles; and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
paſs to my third general Head, at firſt
propoſed to be ſpoken to, and that is,</p>
            <p>III. To conſider, what <hi>Jeſus</hi> means,
when he appeals to his Works and Miracles,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1207700600:60"/>
as to a Teſtimony and witneſs of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and to ſhow that he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and ultimately refer to thoſe done in
the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but to thoſe myſtical ones he would
do in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of which thoſe done in
the Fleſh are but mere Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</p>
            <p>And on this Head I ſhall be ſhort, there
being no Occaſion of many Words on it.
The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> 
               <note n="24" place="bottom">Paſtoral Letter, p. 25.</note> has collected,
many Sayings of <hi>Jeſus</hi> wherein he ſeems
to appeal to the Works he then did and had
done in Fleſh, as to a witneſs of him. But
why might not <hi>Jeſus</hi> then Propheſy, and
mean the ſpiritual Works which <hi>He-in-us</hi>
would do? It is the known Way of the
Prophets to ſpeak of Things to come, as if
they were already paſt, becauſe ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecys
are not to be underſtood, till their
Accompliſhment: Even ſo did <hi>Jeſus</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy,
when he appeal'd to his Works as
I could prove from the Nature and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Expreſſions, but that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be dry and tedious; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I refer the Matter entirely to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who aſſerted that <hi>Jeſus</hi> propheſied
in his <hi>Miracles</hi> as well as in his <hi>Parables,</hi>
and that the Works, he then did in the Fleſh
were but Types of his myſterious Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1207700600:61"/>
that would be the Demonſtration of
his Authority and Meſſiahſhip. Hence it
is that <hi>Origen</hi> 
               <note n="25" place="bottom">Adventus quidem Chriſti unus in Humilitate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletus eſt, alius vero Speratur in Gloria. Et hic primus Adventus in Carne, myſtico quodam Sermone in Scripturis Sanctis Umbra ejus appellatur. <hi>In Jeſu Nave Homil.</hi> viii.</note> ſays that <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s firſt
coming was but Type and Shadow of his
Spiritual Advent; and that his <note n="26" place="bottom">Vera Chriſti Miracula &amp; Sanatio Infirmorum eſt ſpiritalis. <hi>In Matt. C.</hi> xxv.</note> true Miracles, by which his Authority is to be
proved, are Spiritual: Hence it is that St.
<hi>Hilary</hi> repeatedly ſays <note n="27" place="bottom">Haec licet in praſens geſta ſunt, quid tamen in futurum ſignificent, contuendum eſt. <hi>In Matt. C.</hi> x. <hi>S.</hi> 1. Chriſti Geſta aliud portendunt. <hi>C.</hi> xii. <hi>S.</hi> 1. Peragunt formam futuri geſta praerfentia. <hi>C. </hi>x xi.</note> that <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
Works were ſignificative and predictive of
myſterious Operations, which we were eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to look to. And Hence it is that
all the other Fathers interpreted the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in a myſtical and allegorical
Senſe.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion then is, to what Miracles
did <hi>Jeſus</hi> truly and properly appeal, in
the Opinion of the Fathers, for his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Meſſiahſhip? Was it to his Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Antitypal Works? was it to the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
or to the <hi>ſubſiſtance</hi> of his Operations?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1207700600:62"/>
To his ſubſtantial Operations, to be ſure,
which are and will be his ſpiritual ones
upon the Soul that are greater than
thoſe once done on Men's Bodys, and which
will be a proper Proof of his divine Power.
And to declare my Opinion freely I am,
only for ſuch a ſpiritual <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who will
cure the <hi>Errors</hi> call'd the Diſeaſes of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> has not as
yet done.</p>
            <p>But not to diſpute this Point with <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
Gibſon,</hi> I will leave him in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Opinion of his literal <hi>Meſſiah</hi>
and miraculous Operator on Men's Bodys;
if he'll but indulge me in the Belief of my
ſpiritual <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come for the healing of
modern Diſtempers call'd the Sins and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Mankind. And in the mean time
let us draw the Compariſon between his
<hi>litteral</hi> and my <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Jeſus; and let
the World judge, to whom the Preference
is to be given for Power and Authority,</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> is for <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>'s
Meſſiahſhip, becauſe he cured the
<hi>bodily blindneſs</hi> of many miraculouſly;
And a good Work it was: But I am for
the Meſſiahſhip of a ſpiritual <hi>Jeſus</hi> to
come, who will open the <hi>blind Eyes</hi> of
pur Underſtandings to diſcern Truth from
Error, which will be a moſt glorious
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1207700600:63"/>
Operation; that his <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi>
has not as yet done.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> is for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip,
who once cured <hi>bodily Deafneſs</hi> in many,
which was indeed well done of him: But
I am for the Meſſiahſhip of a ſpiritual
<hi>Jeſus</hi> to come, to heal the <hi>Deafneſs</hi> of
our Souls or their <hi>Dulneſs</hi> in Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſublime Myſterys, which will be
a divine Work, that his <hi>Jeſus</hi> has not as
yet done.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> is for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip,
becauſe he cured Men's bodily <hi>Lameneſs,</hi>
for which I do praiſe him: But I am for
a ſpiritual <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip, who will
heal Mankind of their <hi>Halting</hi> between
two and more Opinions; a more Bleſſed
Work, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> has not
as yet done for us !</p>
            <p>And ſo, comparing all other Diſeaſes of
Body and Soul together, I am for the
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> who will heal the Diſeaſes of the
Soul; and have a much leſs Regard for
<hi>Biſhop Gibſon</hi>'s <hi>Jeſus</hi> who cured the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
of a few Men's Bodys; but, for all
that, am not angry with the <hi>Biſhop</hi> for his
high Veneration of his <hi>Jeſus,</hi> neither
would I by any Means have him proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
and puniſh'd for not being of the
ſame Mind with me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1207700600:64"/>
But, becauſe the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſuſpects me of
Infidelity, in that I have ludicrouſly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome of the Miracles of his <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
which, by the by, he has not vindicated
from the Abſurditys and Incredibilitys I
charged them with; I will humour the
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> and, ſuppoſing <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
thoſe Miracles which are allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
interpreted by me, will in thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Miracles compare his <hi>litteral</hi> and my
<hi>ſpiritual</hi> Jeſus together; and appeal to all
Men of Conſideration, which is the moſt
worthy of the Title and Honour of the
true <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> is for his <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahſhip,
who miraculouſly drove the <hi>Buyers</hi>

Power, ſhould furiouſly drive the <hi>Butchers</hi>
and <hi>Graſiers</hi> with their Cattle, to the
Confuſion of their ſeveral Propertys, out
of <hi>Smithfield</hi>: A notable Miracle That!
But I am for the ſpiritual <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
who according to the Form of that
typical Story, will at his Coming expel Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Merchants out of his Church,
who make Merchandiſe of the Goſpel,
Selling their <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi>
of the Letter: A moſt glorious and
Beneficial Work to Mankind will this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1207700600:65"/>
be ! And to prepare Men's Souls for the
ſuſception of ſuch a ſpiritual <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I
intend to publiſh a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and Inconveniencies of an <hi>Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Prieſthood,</hi>
wherein it ſhall be proved,
that Mankind can't be either good, wiſe
or happy under the Kingdom of this
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, without an Abolition
and Extirpation of them.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> is for the Meſſiahſhip of
his <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who <hi>caſt the Devils out of the
Madmen, aud permitted them to enter into
the Herd of Swine,</hi> that <hi>ran violently down
a Precipice and were choak'd in the Sea</hi>:
How great a Miracle it was thus to cure
the Madmen, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> may know beſt,
being perhaps better acquainted with
the Devil than I am; but was it not
for Pity to the <hi>Swineherds</hi> for their
Loſſes, I could even now laugh at the
Thoughts of the Hogs running and tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down-hill, as if the <hi>Devil</hi> drove
them: But leaving the Biſhop <hi>calmly,</hi>
               <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> to admire the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Juſtice of his <hi>Jeſus</hi> in that Act,
I am for the ſpiritual <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the typical form of that Story,
exorcis'd the furious and diabolical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
out of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> of old,
whom no Chains of Reaſon could hold
from doing Violence to the Chriſtians,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1207700600:66"/>
till they were converted; and tho He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the like perſecuting and diabolical.
Spirits to enter into Eccleſiaſtical Swine;
yet will they be precipitated into the <hi>Sea</hi>
of the Knowledge of God, wherein they
will be abſorpt with divine Diviſions and
Contemplations. O moſt glorious Work,
that beſpeaks the Wiſdom, Power and
Goodneſs of our ſpiritual <hi>Jeſus</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the End of it.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> admires his <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for
his Transfiguration on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> tho
neither He nor any body elſe can tell,
wherein lay the Miracle, nor into what
various Figures and Shapes <hi>Jeſus</hi> was
transform'd: But I am for the ſpiritual
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe glorious Transfiguration, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>ſix</hi> grand Days of the Creation, will
be conſpicuous, when with the Eyes of
our Underſtanding we ſhall behold him
metamorphoſed into the Forms of all the
Types of him under the Law. I am now
raviſh'd with the intellectual View of this
Transfiguration; and believe, was I to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, I could give others (except the
Biſhop) an Idea and Conception of it to
their Aſtoniſhment at the Glory of <hi>Jeſus</hi>
in it.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> is for the Meſſiahſhip of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> becauſe he cured a
<hi>Woman of an Iſſue of Blood,</hi> after ſhe had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1207700600:67"/>
ſpent all ſhe had upon Phyſicians to no
purpoſe; which might be, or might not
be a Miracle, for any Thing he can argue
upon it: But I am for the ſpiritual <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Meſſiahſhip, who at his Coming
will, according to that Typical Story,
cure the <hi>Woman</hi> of the Church of her
<hi>Iſſue of Blood,</hi> that is ſhed in Perſecution
and War, which her Eccleſiaſtical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
of the <hi>Clergy</hi> have not been
able to ſtop tho they have receiv'd large
Fees and Stipends of the Church to that
Purpoſe. Will not this be a deſirable and
beneficial Work to all Nations? And who
knows not, (excepting the <hi>Biſhop</hi>) that it
is of the Office of the true Meſſiah, to
give <hi>abundance of Peace</hi> to Mankind, to
<hi>make the Lion to lye down with the Lamb</hi>;
and to induce Men to <hi>break their Swords
into Plow-ſhares,</hi> and <hi>their Spears into
Pruning-hooks</hi>; and to <hi>make Wars to ceaſe</hi>
in all the World. Which Prophecys are ſo
far from being fulfill'd by <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
that there has been nothing but
wrangling and jangling and ſcolding and
fighting about him ever ſince. I wonder
the want of the Accompliſhment of the
foreſaid Prophecys has not long before now
occaſion'd the Rejection of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

nothing is to be ſaid for the Greatneſs of
that Miracle. But I am for the ſpiritual
<hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip, who, according to the
figure of that litteral Story, is to heal the
<hi>Woman</hi> of the Church of her <hi>Infirmity of
the Spirit</hi> of Prophecy, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> of

would not be ſo many Diſputes about
Prophecys and their Interpretations, ſo far,
as there is hardly one Prophecy that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
are agreed about the Senſe of. It
is the grand Characteriſtick of the true
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that he's to reſtore Prophecy and
the Way of Interpretation of the Prophets,
upon the allegorical Scheme too. I ſpeak
this, not only upon the Authority of the
Prophets themſelves, but upon an almoſt
infinite number of Teſtimonys of ancient
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi>; accordingly I expect
the Advent of a ſpiritual Meſſiah, who

Adultereſs with another Man; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of the Church will be a moſt
ſtupendous and miraculous Work, and a
Demonſtration of our <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Meſſiahſhip
beyond Contradiction, in as much as it
will be agreeable to the Opinion, that all
Antiquity entertain'd of the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>

miraculous and beneficial Purpoſe I daily
pray and ſay too, Bleſſed are all thoſe who
love his Appearance!</p>
            <p>After this Faſhion could I go thro' the
other Miracles, I have treated on in theſe
<hi>Diſcourſes</hi>; and Upon the Compariſon ſet
plainly before the Eyes of my <hi>Readers</hi> the
Difference between the <hi>litteral</hi> Miracles of
Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s <hi>carnal</hi> Jeſus and the <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical</hi>
ones of my <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Jeſus, as to
Stupendouſneſs, Uſe and Excellency: But,
what I have here done in the ſeven Inſtances
above, is enough to induce us to believe,
with the Fathers, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s firſt Coming
in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> was but Type and Shadow of
his ſecond Advent in the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> of old when he appeal'd to his
Works then done, as to a Witneſs of his
Authority, did only Propheſy, and re er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultimately
to his myſtical Operations, that
are alone the Proof of his Godlike and
divine Power. Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> ſays <note n="28" place="bottom">Paſtoral Letter, p. 3.</note>
of me, that <hi>pretending to raiſe the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Miracles of our Saviour to a
more exalted and ſpiritual Meaning, I</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1207700600:71"/>
               <hi>have labour'd to take away the Reality
of them, and by that to deſtroy one of the
principal Evidences of Chriſtianity.</hi> But
I preſume now, he'll be ſenſible of the
Raſhneſs and Incogitancy of that Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
If he be not, I ſhall ſay of him,
in Caſe he write any more for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s
<hi>litteral</hi> Miracles in Oppoſition to his
<hi>allegorical</hi> ones, that he's like the Dog
in the Fable (the <hi>Biſhop</hi> will excuſe the
Coarſneſs of the Compariſon) that let go
the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of his Mutton, and catch'd
at the Shadow, and ſo, like a fooliſh
<hi>Cur</hi> as he was, loſt both.</p>
            <p>And thus have I done with the <hi>Three</hi>
general Heads at firſt propoſed to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> Now whether
I am, upon the whole, an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver</hi>
of Chriſtianity, the World is to
judge. I'll make no more ſolemn Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of my Belief of it, much leſs at
this Juncture of Time, when I am under
Proſecution for Infidelity; becauſe it
would be a ſneaking, tame and cowardly
Act in me, and ſuch an Argument of
that meanneſs of Spirit, as I abhor and
deteſt. My <hi>Works</hi> ſhall ſpeak for me, in
which being, conſcious of the Innocency
of my Intentions, and of the Uſefulneſs
of my Deſign, I mean to proceed; not
doubting but ſome of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> upon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1207700600:72"/>
two or three more <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> againſt the
Letter of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> will find
me out, what I am, and whether I am
not a true Profeſſor of the Religion of the
ſpiritual and holy <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean Time, I'll not compound
the Difference depending between Biſhop
<hi>Gibſon</hi> and myſelf, upon any other Terms,
than his making me ample Satisfaction
for the Injurys done to my Reputation
and low Fortunes. Tho he may thirſt
after my Life, or at leaſt, my Liberty;
yet under the Providence of God I fear
not the Loſs of either. God be prais'd,
this Kingdom is bleſs'd with ſuch a
Civil Adminiſtration for Wiſdom, Juſtice
and Mercy as no Nation of the World
can equal. Our Magiſtrates are all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
Lovers of Truth, and of an
Enquiry into it; and ſo tender of the
religious as well as of the civil Rights of
the Subject, that I have nothing to dread
from them.</p>
            <p>There is ſomewhat <hi>popular</hi> indeed, tho
nothing true nor rational, in the Clamour
and Accuſations of the <hi>Clergy</hi> againſt me.
Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> would inſinuate <note n="29" place="bottom">Paſtoral Letter, p. 35.</note> that
my <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> on <hi>Miracles</hi> ſtrike <hi>at the
Foundation of civil Society</hi>; but by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1207700600:73"/>
Conſequence of his own making.
I confeſs, it is an heinous Crime to write
any Thing, that tends to the Subverſion or
Prejudice of the civil Society: But how
will the <hi>Biſhop</hi> make me guilty of it? If
the <hi>Clergy</hi> will not be Diſturbers of the
Peace of the publick upon my <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>;
it's certain, that the Quiet of the World,
which I wiſh and aim at, will be inviolably
kept and preſerv'd for all me. My Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
indeed, when I walk the Streets of
this <hi>City,</hi> are <hi>numerous</hi>; and if any of them
ſhould break the Peace, what ſerves my
<hi>Lord Mayor</hi>'s Power for, but to chaſtiſe
them for it? As for my ſelf and my Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
at home which as yet are <hi>without
Number,</hi> we are all <hi>Quietiſts</hi> and ſhould act
againſt our Conſciences and Religion, if we
ſhould injure any Man in his Perſon and
Property. But I ſmile to ſee a <hi>Clergyman</hi>
all on a ſudden, like the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſo tender
of the Welfare of the Publick, when <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks,</hi>
in all Ages paſt, have been the
<hi>Bane</hi> of Society and the <hi>Peſt</hi> of Mankind,
as appears from the Wars and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they have rais'd in the World; and
from that Strife, Variance and Diſcords,
they have occaſion'd in Citys and Familys.
And with Submiſſion to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who
I hope will not be angry for my ſaying
it, I am ſure, the <hi>Clergy</hi> at this Juncture,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1207700600:74"/>
even darken'd and obſcured the ſeemingly
native ſimplicity of the Story of the Life
of Jeſus. So leaving you to chew upon this,
I turn</p>
            <p>My Addreſs to <hi>Infidels,</hi> particularly to
the two moſt renown'd Writers of the
Party, Mr. <hi>Grounds</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scheme.</hi> I
ſhould, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> by Right ſalute you
with the Title of <hi>Free-Thinkers,</hi> a proper
Name for your Philoſophical Sect, who
are for the free Exerciſe of your Reaſon
about divine and ſpeculative Points in
Theology. And I had diſtinguiſh'd you
by this Title from your Apoſtatical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarys,
but that I had a Mind to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
my old Friends the <hi>Clergy</hi> in giving
you a no more honourable Title than I
do them. And I truſt you will not be
offended at the Title of <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſince not
only your Writings ſeem to have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to Infidelity; but, if there be any
Fault in your Principles, you know how
to charge it on your Adverſarys, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Advocates for Chriſtianity, whoſe
Abſurditys, falſe Reaſonings. Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys,
and fooliſh Gloſſes on the Scriptures
have occaſion'd your departure from the
Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I thank Mr. <hi>Scheme</hi> for the noble Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his Book, which I received and
read with Pleaſure. But inſtead of one,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1207700600:75"/>
he ſhould have ſent me a <hi>Dozen</hi> for the
Uſe of Friends and Borrowers, who are
very curious and importunate for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal
of it. For what Reaſon He envys
the <hi>Bookſellers</hi> the publick Sale of his Work,
chuſing rather to give it away <hi>gratis,</hi> than
that they ſhould reap any Profit by it,
I know not. Surely it is not to bring
an <hi>Odium</hi> on the <hi>Clergy</hi> for Perſecutors,
as if ſuch an uſeful and philoſophical
Piece might not appear publickly without
danger from them: If ſo, I hope the
<hi>Clergy</hi> will reſent the Indignity, and invite
him to a Publication of his Book, with
a Promiſe of Impunity, which would
wipe off the Reproach, which this clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
Method of diſpoſing of it has caſt
on them.</p>
            <p>I once almoſt deſpair'd, <hi>Sirs,</hi> of ſeeing
ſuch another Piece from your Quarter. I
was afraid the Proſecution of the <hi>Moderator</hi>
would have deterr'd you from the Preſs,
whereby our excellent Controverſy on Foot
muſt have been drop't: But the ſudden and
unexpected appearance of Mr. <hi>Scheme</hi> has
revived me, and rejoiced the Cockles of my
Heart. Go on then, <hi>Great Sirs,</hi> in this
Controverſy, which Mr. <hi>Grounds</hi> happily
commenc'd, and if you are deny'd the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Preſs, and publick Sale of your
Books, I hope you'll, for all that, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1207700600:76"/>
offers it ſelf, oblige the Learned and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
with ſome more of your bright Lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations,
tho' you Print them, and diſpoſe
of them in this clancular and ſubtile Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <p>It is not that I wiſh well to your Cauſe
of Infidelity, that I thus encourage you.
You have more Senſe and Reaſon than to
ſuſpect me tainted with unbelieving Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
Chriſtianity will ſtand its Ground
againſt your battering Armour; and the
Church of Chriſt will be the more firmly
eſtabliſh'd on a Rock of Wiſdom, for that
Oppoſition you make to it. Tho' you will
entirely vanquiſh the litteral <hi>Schemiſts,</hi>
and ride in Triumph over them; yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Defenders of the Faith, call'd <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts,</hi>
will ariſe to your Confutation and
final overthrow.</p>
            <p>If I am not miſtaken, <hi>Sirs,</hi> your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarys,
the litteral <hi>Schemiſts,</hi> whom I
call <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> are about making a Retreat,
and yeilding the Field of Battle to you.
The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> the greateſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
on their Side, will not only find it
hard to levy any more Forces in Defence
of his <hi>twelve</hi> litteral Prophecys; but he
knows, that, if he draw his Sword any
more againſt you, he muſt attack too the
Authority of the Fathers for the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Interpretation of ſome of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecys,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1207700600:77"/>
already urg'd in my <hi>Supplements</hi> to
the <hi>Moderator</hi>; or, if the Fathers are
neglected by him; they and I, keeping out
of the Reach of his <hi>Bug-Pear,</hi> will treat
him with ſuch familiar Language, as never
was given to one of his Order.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Scheme</hi> ſeems to promiſe us a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
on the Miracles in the Scriptures,
I hope he'll be as good as his Word, and
'ere long publiſh it. This Diſcourſe of
mine can't poſſibly ſuperſede his. As I
queſtion not, but his Thoughts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on Miracles will be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
ſo I ſhall be a little impatient till
I ſee them. But be his Diſcourſe on Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of what Kind ſoever, I believe it
will hardly be an Obſtruction to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
in Hand, which I intend, by
Gods Leave, to go on with, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our Spiritual <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> to
whom be Glory and Praiſe for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>
