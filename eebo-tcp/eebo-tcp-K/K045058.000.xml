            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O <hi>Silvia, Silvia!</hi> thou haſt too ſtrongly poſſeſs'd my Heart, ever to be diſlodg'd.—The Poſſeſſion of other Beauties only fires my I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination with thoſe Joys thou alone art capable to impart.—I have made thee an ungrateful Return to a diſintereſted Paſſion, and made thee ſuffer for what I ought to adore thee.—That Virtue which I endeavour'd to ſubdue, has made me Captive; and I know not if the Grace of Beauty, or the moſt ſhining Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of thy Sex, influences moſt.—I have wrong'd thee, and am—unjuſt.

                  <p>When Love's ſincere and conſtant, how does it bleſs and how improve Mankind? yet, ambitious Stateſmen, and fooliſh medling Prieſts, wou'd bind in Fetters the noble free-born Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Vain Attempt!—Marriage ne'er yet kindled a mutual Flame, where it was not, but often has extinguiſh'd it where it was; Love is its ſelf its own Security, and needs no other Bonds.</p>

I am reſolv'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to marry; and ſhe ſeems as much reſolv'd never to comply without it. Whatever is the Meaning of it, I find my ſelf more aſham'd than angry at the Diſappointment. Tho' 'tis certain that I never did, nor ever can, love any other Woman half ſo well. I feel a ſtrange Palpitation here!

I am not ſure that I don't like her the better for refuſing me.—I am ſure of nothing—but that I won't marry—I muſt e'en have recourſe to the general Remedy in theſe Caſes, a leſs ſcrupulous Female.

                  <p>My Reſolution may ſeem ſtranger than it is; I will therefore tell you the Reaſon of it. Some time ago, my Wife was very ſick (that curſed <hi>Geneva</hi> often made her ſo) then I fell ſick with Grief; but ſhe ſoon recovering, I recover'd too. On this Occaſion, ſhe told me, if I dy'd firſt, that ſhe ſhou'd break her Heart. Yet, ſhe is dead, and I, hard-hearted and ungrateful Wretch, am here alive to ſpeak it.</p>

                  <p>Let me but dry my Eyes, and then I will. She ſaid that ſhe had heard of People that had been buried alive, and being troubled with Fits, thought, perhaps, that might be her Caſe.</p>

No Storm of Rage ruffles her lovely Face; no Thought of Vengeance ſwells her beating Breaſt; Virtue, Love, and Grief, ſo amply fill her Mind, there is no Room for any ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gueſt.

                  <p>Thy more than Child-like Duty and Affection, thy yielding Sweetneſs, and determin'd Virtue, of which each Hour you give me freſh Examples, do ſo affect me, that I am torn 'twixt Joy and Wonder, Sorrow and Remorſe, when-e'er I look upon thee.

               </sp>

                  <p>Indeed I was; but all ſhall yet be well; ſhortly you ſhall be convinced, that he's ſo far unworthy of your Love, that gentle Peace and Joy ſhall fill your Breaſt, and he be ſcorn'd at firſt, and ſoon forgot.</p>

                  <p>We live as they do in moſt Batchelors Families, very lovingly. While my Maſter is entertaining the Houſe-keeper in his Chamber, I am as civil to the Cook-maid in the Garret.</p>

                  <p>O ſad, O ſad! what pity it is that young Men ſhould ſpend their Time unfruitfully with naughty Women; when, were they honeſtly married, they might in a lawful way do much good in their Generation. If you have any Thoughts of Marriage, I have a Widow in my Eye, that would do very well for you. She has ſomething to bring you to, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Thirty I aſſure you. While her Husband was in Health, ſhe brought him a Child every Year; but I don't know how it fell out, he grew weary of her, and, as it is ſuppos'd, thought to have kill'd her with Kindneſs: but as it always happens in thoſe Caſes, he did his own Buſineſs inſtead of hers, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conſumption—and dy'd about a Month ago.</p>

                  <p>No, Goody <hi>Buſy,</hi> that will never do for me; a wanton young Widow for a Wife, and a skittiſh Horſe for a long Journey, are two the moſt troubleſome things a Man can meet withal.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. Buſy.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps you would rather have a Maid. Truly they are tickliſh things, and I don't much care to meddle or make with 'em. But I do know of a Farmer's Daughter, that will fit you to a Hair. Her Father is a ſufficient Man, and will ſtock a Farm for you. 'Tis true, indeed, ſhe has had one Child; for I am a Woman of Integrity, and would not deceive any Body in theſe matters for the World. They did not marry her ſoon enough. But ſhe'll make an excellent ſtirring Wife, I'll warrant her.</p>

                  <speaker>Jon.</speaker>
                  <p>A Maid that has had a Child, is worſe than a Widow that's paſt it. I don't like any Body that you have propos'd half ſo well as yourſelf.</p>

But what have been my Tortures e'er ſince I conſented to conceal the
