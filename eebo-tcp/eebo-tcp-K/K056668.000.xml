            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reception a former Work
of this Kind has met with in the
World, and the little which has
been ſaid againſt it, as to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, muſt be acknowledged to be
all owing to the Truth, coming with an
irreſiſtible Force upon the Minds of Men,
and which always carries its own Evidence
along with it; when we have met with
the Enemy deſcanting upon it, we have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1146200300:3"/>
heard them, even in the midſt of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Curſes, and hard Names, which they
caſt upon the Author, yet at every
Pauſe cry out, <hi>Damn the Circumſtance,</hi> I
doubt there is too much Truth in it, tho'
I hate the Deſign of making it Publick.
This makes it clear, which has often,
and upon many other Occaſions, been
ſaid, that our late People had a kind of
Popery in their Politicks, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that much
of their Succeſs conſiſted in keeping the
People Blind and Ignorant in the Main
and moſt Eſſential Points of their Affairs,
and which it was moſt neceſſary for them
to know; that they were ſo far from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what Uſage they had received Abroad
from their Allies, that when they came to
be a little rightly inform'd, they could
not Frame Idea's of ſo much Knavery in
their Heads, or think it poſſible that any
People, who called themſelves Allies, could
at the ſame time carry themſelves in ſuch a
Manner, to thoſe for whom they had
made the leaſt Profeſſions of any Reſpect,
or for whoſe common Safety they had the
leaſt Concern.</p>
            <p>As the Truth of what has been thus ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
is hereby acknowledged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by the Enemy, which is the beſt
kind of Evidence; ſo the Seaſonableneſs
of making that Truth Publick in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it hath been by the former Tract, and
as it ſhall or may be in this, is juſtified
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1146200300:4"/>
and clear'd beyond all Poſſibility of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
by the late Publick Reſolutions of
the Honourable Houſe of Commons, where
it comes into the World with the Sanction
and Authority of the great Repreſentative of
the Nation; it is true, the Particulars in
the Votes amount to a moſt exceſſive
Height; and tho' it was known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by many to be very great, yet I
muſt confeſs few imagined them to be ſo
ſurprizing, the Account ſo large, and the
Particulars ſo many, as they appear to
be; alſo one Thing is obtain'd by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Houſe of Commons, which
the Credit of a ſingle Author was by no
Means ſufficient for, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
had any Share in the Deficiency, and in
the Injuries which this Nation has ſuffered
under the Weight of this Confederacy;
many would be brought by the Power
of Reaſoning, and the Force of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
which are Things all People are
not equally furniſhed to reſiſt; they would,
I ſay, be brought to confeſs, that there
might have been Defects in general, and
that thoſe Defects appeared in the Affairs of
the Empire, the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and ſuch like,
any Thing but the <hi>Dutch</hi>; but ſuch an
Aſcendant had the Influence of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and the Confederacy of the late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
with the Parties concern'd, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
over the People, that tho' any thing
would go down with them againſt other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1146200300:5"/>
People, yet if the Dear <hi>Dutch</hi> came into
the Diſpute, nothing could be born with,
but all the reſt was the pure Effect of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobitiſm,
and the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How fatal this has been to us I may
hereafter have Leiſure to examine, and
every Day is like to diſcover more and
more of it to us; indeed Things were
mounted to ſuch a violent Prepoſſeſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us in Favour of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that we began
to think even our own Conſtitution ſtood in
need of further Security from them,
and politickly brought the <hi>Dutch</hi> into our
National Concerns; thus making ourſelves
beholden to them for a Guarantee,
or Safety to the Succeſſion of <hi>Hannover,</hi>
that this might be a Handle to our doing
other Things for them, ſo exorbitant in
their own Nature, as that no Nation, but
ſuch as depended upon them for ſomething
very weighty and ſignificant, would
ever conſent to, or could upon any
other Pretence be perſwaded into; yet this
was not all, for when we had brought our
People to ſtoop to ſo mean a Thought, as
that our Succeſſion, Ratified by both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and Incorporated by both the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the late
Solemn Treaty of Union, could receive any
Addition of Strength from Abroad, more
than that of the Intereſt and Alliance of ſo
powerful a Prince, as his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Hannover,</hi> and his Allies; that we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1146200300:6"/>
ſtood in Need of that incoherent Article
of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Guarantee; when I ſay we had
ſtoop'd ſo low, as to level our Conſtitution
to the Common Notion of Leagues and
Treaties between other and differing Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that it ſhould receive a farther
Sanction thereby, it was not hard then
to fill the Heads of the poor People with a
Belief, that whoever made the leaſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
againſt any Thing hereafter, which
either the <hi>Dutch</hi> might do by us, or which
we might do by them, acted therein againſt
the Proteſtant Succeſſion: This was a Point
ſo well gain'd by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that on the
Faith of a Man, if they gain'd it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it was the beſt Bargain they made
during the whole War; and if our late
Managers granted it ſo alſo, they muſt
either have given up their Sences to the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> or had moſt deſpicable Thoughts of
the Strength of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to ſupport our own Settlement; or
which I ſpeak moſt unwillingly, there muſt
have been ſome private Bargain driven,
of which I ſhall venture to ſay no more,
but that I hope no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> could be
found that would be guilty of it.</p>
            <p>To wave therefore a Reflection ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome,
let us go back to the Obſervation
before, <hi>viz.</hi> this Threefold End we have
ſeen it anſwer to the <hi>Dutch</hi>; what End it
will ever anſwer to us remains a Myſtery,
and will in all Probability remain ſo for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1146200300:7"/>
many Years to come, if not for ever; the
Ends which I ſay it anſwered for the <hi>Dutch</hi>
were Three.</p>
            <p>1. The Barrier Treaty, which with the
ſeparate Article, was join'd as the Advance
Money of a Loan, by Way of what our
People call Prompt-Payment, and which
the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the Confidence to Paum up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us as a ſmall Matter, and a Thing due to
them for the great Kindneſs done for
us by them, in taking upon them to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our Succeſſion. I am not ignorant of
that weak and fooliſh Uſe which the Enemies
of Peace made of that Objection ſpoken
of in the other foremention'd Tract, p. 21.
<hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">"That it may not be right in Point
of Policy, or good Senſe, that a Foreign
Power ſhould be call'd in to confirm our
Succeſſion, by Way of Guarantee, but
only to acknoledge it; otherwiſe we
put it out of the Power of our own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature
to change our Succeſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Conſent of that Prince or State
who is Guarantee. However, our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
may hereafter, by the Tyranny
and Oppreſſion of any ſucceeding Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
be reduced to the Fatal Neceſſity of
breaking in upon the Excellent and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Settlement now in Force."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This by all Means they will have as an
Aim taken for the Pretender, as if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ought not to put it out of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1146200300:8"/>
Power of our Legiſlature to limit the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
whatever Neceſſity may happen;
even when this Race may be all in their
Graves; that therefore we have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Alteration of the Succeſſion in our
View; theſe People who contend thus,
forget the mighty Noiſe we have had from
them about <hi>Parliamentary Limitations,</hi> a
Word the Whigs have made ſo Sacred, that
it has been like the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of their
Liberties, and with which they run down
the Hereditary Right of their Princes, as if
there had been nothing at all in it but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and Arbitrary Government, till at
Length it was happily diſcovered, that
they were very well conſiſtent together;
and that they who beſt underſtood He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Right, had proved it to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Parliamentary Limitation, and then
all was well again. But after all this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
was it to be imagined that the ſame
People could ſo eaſily give up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Right of limiting the Succeſſion to
a Foreign Nation; and by making a League
of Guarantee for the Succeſſion, legitimate
the Impertinence of Strangers, who may
hereafter intermeddle with our Conſtitution,
and may tell a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, they have
no Power to alter or meddle with the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of the Crown, for that it is already
Settled, and they are Guarantees of it?
What has been, may be; and what may be,
may be ſuppoſed to be; if then any of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1146200300:9"/>
the Family of <hi>Hannover</hi> ſhould Tyrannize or
Abdicate, or the ſame, or like Circumſtances
ſhould happen, as have happened before,
the Parliament would be diſabled from
declaring the Throne vacant, and filling
up the ſame with ſuch other of the Family
as they find convenient; which according
to all the Whig Principles which we have ſo
often heard of, is inſeparable from the
Conſtitution, and much more Sacred than
any Thing which has been Hereditary in
the World. I do not encline to concern
theſe Papers with the popular Diſputes
which have troubled the World ſo much
and ſo long, about the Difference between
Hereditary and Parliamentary Right; how
far they are the ſame, or which is beſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Authorities, and Originals,
whether of Divine or Civil Right; it is
enough to take hold here of the Whigs
own Argument, and allowing all they have
ſaid on this Head to be Orthodox, whether
it really be ſo or no; it muſt neceſſarily
follow, that this Parliamentary Right can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or ought not, to be given out of our
Hinds, and put, by a Treaty, into the Hands
of Foreigners; ſo that it ſhall be in their
Power to put their Negative into our next
Limitation of the Crown. If this be not
to give away our Liberties, I would be glad
to know what it is to keep them; if there
be any Choice of Tyrants, and if it weighs
any Thing, when our Priviledges are given
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1146200300:10"/>
up, who is it they ſhould be given up to?
I confeſs myſelf more willing to be a Slave
at Home than Abroad, and to be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd
on by a Prince of our own, than by a
Foreign Nation; and if there were no other
Reaſon for that than this, it would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to juſtifie the Choice, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that
there are more Ways to avoid the Miſchief
of it, that an oppreſſing Prince has ſome
times chang'd his Meaſures, or he may be
reſtrain'd, or may die, and thereby a Nation
may be delivered; but ſuch a Convention
as this, made with a Foreign Nation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
that whole Nation upon all Occaſions
to embark itſelf, and its whole Strength, in
Defence of the Capitulation agreed on; and
thus by this Method the Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in future Limitations of the Crown
ſeems to be effectually given up: How the
Whigs would have liked this Doctrine if it
had come from any one but themſelves, may
be beſt gueſs'd at by the Warmth they
ſhewed about the League ſaid to be made
by the late King <hi>James</hi> and the King of
<hi>France</hi>; which put this whole Nation into a
Flame, and Reaſon good ſo far as that
League appear'd; for what was it, or what
could we imagine it to be, but a Treaty
of Guarantee with the <hi>French</hi> for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Succeſſion of Popery in <hi>England?</hi>
Whereas the Settling the Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of this Nation was the undoubted
Right of the People in Parliament, and ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1146200300:11"/>
by the ſame Rule muſt the Succeſſion of
our Princes be. The Sum of all this is,
that by the Whigs own Arguments, and by
their own Principles, which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
profeſſed, and adher'd to, and by
the ſame Rule from which they acted in
the Revolution, the accepting a Guarantee,
for the ſecuring the Succeſſion of the Crown
of this Kingdom to any Family, or Branch
of a Family, Race, or Line whatſoever, is
no leſs than giving up the Privileges of
the People, and diveſting the Parliament
of the Power of limiting the Succeſſion to
the Crown.</p>
            <p>It may be remember'd, that in the late
Treaty of Union with <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Overtures were made, to have engaged
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be Guarantees of that Treaty;
and though that Propoſal ſeem'd to come
from ſuch Hands, as gave Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was rather a Deſign to deſtroy,
than ſecure the ſaid Treaty, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
having at that Time diſcover'd Willingneſs
enough to have prevented the Concluſion
of that Treaty, yet thoſe that knew any
Thing of the Reſentment expreſſed at that
Time here againſt that Propoſal, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
to <hi>England,</hi> and deſtructive of
the Conſtitution of both Kingdoms, would
wonder that ever the ſame Miniſtry ſhould
ſo far change their Notions, as to admit
the ſame Guarantee in ſo Nice an Affair, as
the Succeſſion to their own Crown, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1146200300:12"/>
they rejected with Contempt in a Treaty
with the Neighbouring Nation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another End anſwered by this
Treaty of Guarantee, was giving an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to play their own Game
with us, with Reſpect to other Treaties, Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,
Proportions of Payments, Ships, Troops,
and the like; of this ſo much has been ſaid
already, and is yet like to be ſaid farther in
Publick, that I ſhall need ſay the leſs to it
here, my Deſign being rather to juſtifie the
Reſentment all honeſt Men entertain, at the
mean Politicks and Submiſſions of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
here, and to ſhow the Neceſſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
wiſer for the future, than to Animate
People againſt any of our Confederates.
I am as forward as any to agree, that the
Advantages of a ſtrict Union among the
Confederates are very great; and that,
as Her Majeſty expreſt it, the Intereſt of
the States of <hi>Holland</hi> be looked upon as our
own; but this by no means hinders us from
deſiring that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould uſe us well,
ſhould ſhew a Reciprocal Kindneſs, and
ſhould act with a mutual Concern for the
General Confederated Intereſt; and that
we ſhould not be willing to ſee them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon us in any of thoſe Particulars,
or be eaſie, and ſubmit quietly to it when
they do; and this is ſo much Juſtice, that
none can object againſt; and what is the
beſt, if not the only Way, to cultivate and
maintain that Friendſhip, and good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1146200300:13"/>
on both Sides, which is ſo
much the Intereſt of the Confederacy in
General, and of the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves in
Particular. They who contend, that the
enquiring into theſe Things ſeems to ſhow
a Diſregard to the Confederacy in General,
or to the ſeveral Parties concerned in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
ſeem to make ſeverer Satyrs upon
the <hi>Dutch</hi> than they are aware of. The
Deficiencies of the Performance they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, the want of a due Regard then
to the Confederacy muſt certainly lye rather
in thoſe that have been the Cauſe of thoſe
Deficiencies, than thoſe that have not; for
who are moſt juſtly to be charged with
ſlighting and diſregarding the mutual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Conſederacy, they that have
failed in the Performance of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or they that complain of it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to have them performed? <hi>Britain</hi> has
all along ſhown, by a Zeal Fatal to herſelf,
her Willingneſs to puſh on the War with
all imaginable Vigour; in order to which,
when Her deficient Allies, having leſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the general Good, have run the
Venture of Miſcarriage, to ſhorten their
Expence; <hi>Britain,</hi> as if the whole Charge
of the War had been her Due to pay, has
zealouſly ſupply'd both their Quota's, and
her own: While ſhe was willing to do thus,
her Confederates daily encreas'd their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies,
and her Expence, as they might
very well do, finding her ſo eaſie; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1146200300:14"/>
while ſhe was willing to ſit ſtill, and ſee
herſelf, thus uſed, it was very remarkable
how Augmentations, and Increaſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
was every Year propoſed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
as well in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and none ſo forward as the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to increaſe the Quota's of the Troops,
and the Charges of the War, upon the
reſt of his Confederates; quietly waiting
for their ſupplying Additional Troops, and
taking Care to have very few of his
own.</p>
            <p>While we ſubmitted to all theſe Things,
the War went quietly on, but whether
ſo ſucceſsfully, or no, as it might have
done, if the Allies had anſwered what we
had Reaſon to expect from them, is left
for them to Anſwer. At laſt, the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Court entering into a more narrow Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Things, have not thought fit ſo
calmly to ſuffer the Weight of the War to
lye heavier upon one Shoulder than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and tho' equally willing to bear their
Share of the Burthen, yet not forward
to carry that Load, which ought to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other Shoulders. They are now calling
upon their Confederates, to conſider a little
the Juſtice of their ſeveral Treaties, and to
look back, and ſee what they are obliged
to do, if they expect the War ſhould be
carried on any farther; if they are diffident
of the Succeſs of theſe Remonſtrances from
their Experience, how fruitleſs the like
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1146200300:15"/>
have been before, and have therefore at
the ſame Time embrac'd the Occaſion that
has offer'd, towards putting an End to the
War, by an Honourable Peace; they will
be juſtified in it before all the World, both
now, and for ever; when it ſhall be at the
ſame Time underſtood, in what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and for how many Years, this War
has been carried on; nor can the Artifices
of an Adverſe Party among us delude ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their ſuggeſting to the World, that
the Government here is in the Intereſt of
<hi>France,</hi> ſince they can have no other Reaſon
to back that Suggeſtion, than that they were
not willing to carry on a War upon unequal
Terms, and in a Confederacy with Allies,
who would not perform their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and in which thoſe, who expected
the greateſt Advantages from it, paid the
leaſt Part of the Expence towards it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Third End which this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Complaint againſt a Peace has been
Calculated to Anſwer, and which the Party
has taken Care to make as popular as they
can, is a general Notion, that thoſe who
are for a Peace, do it with a Deſign, by
the Aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> to introduce the
Pretender; however weak and inconſiſtent
ſuch a Conſequence may be, nothing is
more certain, than that many innocent, and
well-meaning People, have been prevailed
upon to believe it; and tho' the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
of the Thing in its own Nature,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1146200300:16"/>
and the ſteady Zeal of the Perſons who they
charge with it, and who have all along, in
a Courſe of many Years, teſtified their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of that Intereſt, and taken ſuch
Steps againſt it, as have been moſt effectual
to the cutting off all Hope, both from him
and his Party, might ſuffice to any reaſonable
People; yet this ſeems to be one of thoſe
Difficulties which can be ſolved only by
a little Patience and Time: To thoſe who
will be convinced by Argument, it ſeems
ſufficient, that our putting a ſtop to a War,
which we carried on at ſo much Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and which had in View rather an
utter Empoveriſhing the Nation, than a
timely Reducing our Enemies to Reaſon,
however, was not only neceſſary on many
other Accounts, but greatly our Advantage
on this Account, in eſpecial Manner; that
thereby we might be left in a Condition to
defend our Conſtitution, and to preſerve
Power to maintain our Succeſſion, as our
Parliament had thought fit to limit it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Help of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and without
being put to ſo weak, ſo ſcandalous, and
ſo diſhonourable a Shift, as to accept of
the Guarantee of Foreign States, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeve
our own Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>When I look farther into this ſcandalous
Thing, called a Guarantee for our Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
methinks it repreſents to me our
People on their Knees to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for the
Mighty Favour of taking us into their High
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1146200300:17"/>
and Mighty Protection; and indeed, when
this is compared with the Manner with
which the States of <hi>Holland</hi> carried on the
<hi>Geentruydenbergh</hi> Treay, wherein the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Peace for us was alſo left wholly to,
or engroſſed by, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> the
Thing ſeems very much of a Peice. The
Barrier Treaty alſo has much of the ſame
Manner in it, which being handled at large
by itſelf, I ſay no more to here. I have
obſerved, that at the Time when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to talk here of Peace, and when the
<hi>French</hi> Articles began to appear, we were
mightily amuſed with the <hi>Dutch</hi> making
Offers, that they would take away the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
from us of want of Money, or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> would advance to us
Four Millions Sterling, to encourage us to
carry on the War. That the <hi>Dutch</hi> made
ſuch an Offer Publickly in Form is known
to be a Miſtake; but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> might
be willing to lend, or to give as much as
that amounts to, to have the Sole Direction
of making the Peace, that ſo their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Intereſt, which they never forget, might
be principally provided for, this there can
be no great Queſtion of; and the <hi>Dutch</hi>
are not without Cunning enough to make
it ſo well worth their while, as that ſuch
a Sum of Money ſhould not be ill laid out.
But thoſe People ſhould do well to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Two or Three Things which lye hid
in this Notion, of the <hi>Dutch</hi> lending us ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1146200300:18"/>
much Money, and which by Way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary,
may be of great Uſe to us, in the
underſtanding of other Parts of Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on that Side. (1.) That if the States
of <hi>Holland</hi> for the carrying on the War,
could ſpare us ſo much Money to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us that we might not make a Peace
without them, tho' that has not yet been
thought of, them however, all they thought
fit to ſay in former Times, of their being
impoveriſhed, and exhauſted, and not in
a Condition to pay their Quota's, muſt be
a manifeſt Fraud and Cheat, and muſt be
with Deſign to put upon us the Neceſſity
of carrying it on upon unequal Conditions;
and this they could not have entertained a
Thought of, without firſt being ſenſible
that they had us at ſo much Advantage, as
that they knew, whenever they thought fit
to eaſe their own Charge, they might-put
the Hardſhip upon us. (2.) Since it
was obtained by the Arts of their other
Conduct, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the Sole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Peace, it followed then, that
we were under an Obligation to carry on
the War at their bidding; from whence it
was moſt natural to believe, they were not
dark-ſighted enough not to make their other
Advantages. (3.) Theſe Things make it
no longer a Myſtery, why the <hi>Dutch</hi> would
advance any Sum of Money for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
us to carry on the War, becauſe
it followed, that we ſhould carry it on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1146200300:19"/>
under the ſame Inequalities and Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which we did before; but now theſe
Things are detected, and if we ſhould come
to a Neceſſity of carrying on the War,
which God forbid, yet that it ſhould be more
than probable we may not only demand
that they begin upon a new Foot, and
make up all their Quota's for the Time to
come, but alſo may call upon them for what
is paſt; alſo it is more than probable, that
they may then plead Poverty with us, as they
did before, and talk no more of the great
Sums they would lend us. (4.) There is yet
another Remark to be made upon this Head,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> advancing ſuch great
Sums of Money to us; we have never found
but theſe Sums were to be all lent upon
good Parliamentary Security and on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
current in <hi>England</hi>; and we might not
be thought ungrateful to the Lenders, if
we asked them, where was the Advantage
of all that? Was it to us, or to themſelves?
They muſt not know the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſo well as
we have Reaſon to know them, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find them ever forgetful of their
own Intereſt in any Propoſal they may
make. It is true, we have complained of
our being impoveriſlſed and exhauſted, and
not in a Condition to carry on the War, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at the rate which it hath been carried
on at, without great Inconveniencies, and
Involving, Mortgaging, and Anticipating
for us, and our Poſterity, at a Rate, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1146200300:20"/>
neither are like to ſee the End of; but what
is our Defect? We do not want Lenders, but
Funds to borrow upon; we have Uſurers
enough among us to devour us, we want
no Help from the <hi>Dutch</hi>; we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Sort of Men among us, who having
little or no Intereſt in the Freehold, have
amaſſed infinite Sums of Money in Caſh,
with which they Trade upon the reſt, and
live upon the Blood and Vitals of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
theſe, like the Eagles where the
Carkaſs falls, gather together; and if the
Parliament can but find Funds, tho' they
boaſt of having the Power of Credit in
themſelves, and often think of making
themſelves Formidable, by threatning the
Government that they will lend no Money,
and that they can ruin the Publick Credit,
by refuſing to advance their Money, yet
they can no more forbear, than a Vulture
can forbear his Prey; the Funds are the
Carkaſs they feed on; they are as Hungry
for them, as a Lion that has been Hunting,
and found no Food; and in ſpight of their
Faith, often Pledg'd to their Party and
Friends, to run down Credit, and lend no
Money, let but the Miniſtry find a Fund,
and the Parliament eſtabliſh a Lottery, or
Subſcription, or Loan, and they are ready
to trample one another to Death to get in
their Money. So that after all that hath
been ſaid of the <hi>Dutch</hi> lending us Money,
we ſee nothing to be ſaid to it, but what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1146200300:21"/>
was ſaid in Anſwer to ſome Bantering Lines
in the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. made upon
the King, which his Majeſty by Repartee
anſwered himſelf thus.<q>
                  <l>" <hi>Charles</hi> at this Time having no Need,</l>
                  <l>" Thanks you as much as if he did.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is apparent in our Caſe we want no
Lenders; we have been devoured with
Harpies already, who think, as no doubt
the <hi>Dutch</hi> would alſo think, and perhaps
ſay too, that <hi>the Borrower is Servant to the
Lender.</hi> But we muſt acknowledge we
want <hi>Funds</hi> to borrow, and where to find
them, ſuch excepted as will plunge us yet
farther and farther into a Gulph, whence no
leſs than a Hundred Years can redeem us,
is paſt the Skill of the beſt Advocates for a
War to find out; indeed I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that in all the Noiſe the Faction have
made at theſe Things, they have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
to one Argument againſt the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of raiſing Funds; they have indeed
told us Great Things, <hi>a la Gaſconade,</hi> that
there are Funds enough, that <hi>England</hi> is
vaſtly rich, that there is Money enough,
that we can with Eaſe carry on the War
this Seven Years, and ſuch Rhodomontade,
that they have Surfeited the People with it
for ſome Time; but we do not ſee one of
them that offers any Scheme how, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what deſtructive ruinous Fund, this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1146200300:22"/>
Money may be raiſed, that the People
may judge whether what is alledged be
true, yea, or no; and whether thoſe Funds
they ſhall ſo propoſe, ſhall not be as fatal
to the general Good, as thoſe that have
gone before; with ſuch fallacious Ways have
the People been managed, till they have
led them on to the brink of inevitable Ruin;
and now, as if it were not enough, that
the Nation hath for ſo many Years been
oppreſſed by the War, through the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or Knavery of our Conſederates,
we are modeſtly deſired to proceed in the
War upon the ſame Foot. I confeſs, this
among our own People is a Sign of ſome
National Stupidity and Blindneſs, which
one would hardly think poſſible; but for
our Neighbours, whether the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or others, to deſire in, ſeems to ſmell
of ſomething we want a Word for in our
Tongue, and may be better expreſs'd in
<hi>French</hi> by <hi>Marveillieux Surprenant,</hi> and the
like. I muſt needs ſay I have not yet met
with any Man ſo weak, but what begins
to feel the Force of this Argument enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Soul, if the Allies have not perform'd
according to their Agreement, they ſhould
be reminded of it; and if we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them to make up former Defects,
we ought at leaſt to be careful that they
comply punctually for the Time to come.
Can any People be ſo beſotted to a Party,
as to expect or deſire that a Nation, already
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1146200300:23"/>
impoveriſhed by the unfair Impoſitions of
Her Allies, and not able to carry on the
War on the Terms ſhe hath done for ſome
Time, ſhould not inſiſt upon more Juſtice
for the future, that ſhe may be able to hold
it out?</p>
            <p>Neither is this an unneceſſary Argument
at this Time, for if we can carry on this War
at the Expence of Three Millions and Half
Yearly, inſtead of Seven, then we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to go on Two Years upon the Square
with our Allies, than One Year upon the
unequal Foundation we have gone upon all
along; ſo that to bring our Allies to do us
Juſtice, and to exert themſelves to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, in carrying on the War, is the trueſt
and beſt Step towards the main Point, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
of carrying it on, if we are aſſured we ſhall
no more be impoſed upon; if we ſee the
full Quota's of Troops in the Field, the full
Numbers of Ships in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and
all Things in Readineſs in Time, and fit for
Action; if any Thing will revive the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirits of the Nation it muſt be this;
it muſt be that they have ſome Hopes of not
being cheated again, and that the powerful
Aſſiſtance of the Allies will be a Means of
putting a happy and ſpeedy End to the
War, that a ſafe Peace may follow; and
it is eaſie to find that nothing but this wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
do it; nothing elſe can perſwade an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
Nation to bleed anew, but ſome
Aſſurance that they ſhall not be ſuffered by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1146200300:24"/>
their Allies to bleed to Death, that there
ſhall be ſome End of their Sorrows and
Miſeries, and that every Hand is fairly
engaged in bringing Things to a happy
End.</p>
            <p>But theſe Things ſeem to call for no further
Remark from us, they are ſo natural and
plain in themſelves, that every Child in theſe
Affairs may underſtand them; for if we muſt
carry on the War; it muſt be needful that we
ſuffer ourſelves to be no more abuſed by our
Allies; if we are not to expect Juſtice from our
Allies, then we muſt be unaccountably beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
if we carry on the War; nay, tho' a
worſe Peace were to follow than Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath good Reaſon to expect from the
Negotiations now on Foot.</p>
            <p>But it may not be amiſs to enquire here
what Proſpect there appears of theſe Things,
and what Hopes our Allies do put us in, of
expecting for the future better Treatment;
and that in the Purſuit of the War they
will go on upon a different Foot from that
which they have hitherto gone upon; for if
there was but ſome Appearance of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
for the future, it might be ſome
Encouragement to us to think of proſecuting
the enſuing Campaigns with more Comfort;
but inſtead of this, all we yet ſee amounts to
little that Way, for at Home all the Fruit
of the Diſcovery ſhows only a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
that it is made publick, an inward
fretting that the Fact is too obvious, ſo that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1146200300:25"/>
they cannot contradict it, and an envious
Warmth at the Juſtice done their own
Countrey in it, becauſe it touches upon the
States-General, as if to touch them were
fatal to us all; and perhaps it may indeed be
fatal to ſome Projects the Party had ſer on
Foot here, deſtructive enough to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Country, and of which a little
Time may give us a farther View: This is
clear, in that all the Reply we have here to
the detecting the hard Uſage we have met
with from our Allies, iſſues in Exclamations
at our expoſing the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and falling upon
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſpreading Reports that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to fall out with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and that
we are for a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and a
VVar with the <hi>Dutch</hi>; as if we muſt refrain
a due Inſpection into our own Affairs, for
fear of the Effects it will or may have upon
the <hi>Hollanders</hi>; it is no leſs the Duty of
every. Faithful Repreſentative to enquire
how other Nations may impoſe upon the
People, and waſte and deſtroy us, than it is
how we are embezzelled at Home, for every
Breach of Treaty is in this kind a Depredation
upon the People; and it is moſt reaſonable,
that when they have thus diſcovered the
Fraud, and by who, as well as by what
Means, the Nation is exhauſted and worn
out, they ſhould ſo far expoſe the Matters of
Fact, and the Perſons, that the People may
know by what Means they are impoveriſhed;
this hath been the conſtant Method and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1146200300:26"/>
Uſage of Parliaments, and the Members of
Parliament could not have diſcharged the
Truſt they have committed to them by
the People they Repreſent, it they had
omitted it. Nor can this be called expoſing
the <hi>Dutch</hi>; they lay open the Truth, if that
expoſes the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or any other Perſons or
States, the Misfortune is their own to be
liable to ſuch a Charge; but let ſuch People
anſwer what they would have had the
Houſe of Commons have done, when upon
Enquiry into the State of the War, they
found that we had not been fairly uſed by
the Confederates; if they had held their
Peace, had they not been Criminally Silent?
Had they not betrayed their Countrey? Had
they not been Acceſſary to all the Frauds of
the like Kind which ſhould have happen'd
for the Future? And what would the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Poſterity have been, when they
ſhould have ſeen that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
knew theſe Things, but took no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, or any Care to have the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
informed of them? Muſt it not have been
a juſt Reproach upon them, as it is now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe who knew it before, and yet took
no. Notice of it, or made any Application to
former Parliaments to have it redreſſed? But
it is evident theſe People, who make now
ſuch loud Complaints of the Reflections caſt
upon our Allies, appear more concerned that
the Matter is made Publick, than that it is
true; and are ſo far from deſiring any Cure
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1146200300:27"/>
for the Diſeaſe, that they ſpend all their
Heat and Reſentment at the Diſcoveries of
it; and it is to be obſerved from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
that they make Ten Reflections upon
the Houſe of Commons, and the Preſent
Miniſtry, for the Induſtry and Pains taken
in finding out how, and by whom, the
Nation has been abuſed, for One juſt Remark
upon the Integrity and Zeal in the War of
thoſe Allies, who have uſed us in ſuch a
Manner: Whence ſuch a Spirit can proceed,
and what Reaſon can be given for it, is not
ſo hard to find out, as it is melancholy to
reflect, that ſo it ſhould be.</p>
            <p>I might go forward in this Obſervation
to expoſe the Foundation from whence all
this proceeds, and by which we ſhould ſoon
ſee for what Uſes and Purpoſes ſome People
are ſo deſirous of puſhing on the War; and
how to do it they care not, upon what
Diſadvantages, and unequal Conditions,
they did it; being willing to bear any
part of the Burthen, nay, all the Burthen,
ſo the beloved War were but to be purſued;
the Enquiry into this will open many Scenes
of private Treachery, not yet brought to
Light, and for that I purpoſe to do it in a
Tract by itſelf; I ſhall leave it to a fit Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>It
falls next in View to Interrogate the
Miniſters at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> how they proceed, and
ſee thereby what Meaſures the <hi>Dutch</hi> take
to convince us, that we ſhall have a better,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1146200300:28"/>
and more equal, Ballance kept up among
us, in caſe the War is to be continued.
But here you ſhall find Meaſures calculated
rather to compel the Queen of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
to carry on the War, than to invite
Her Majeſty to it by Aſſurances of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treaties better than in the Times paſt.
This is a Temper ſo different from what
might be expected from a People, who had
ſo treated their Allies, to us who complain
of being ſo treated, that it is as before,
<hi>Marvellieux</hi>; or to put it plainer, a kind of
throwing off the Mask; as if we were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to ſubmit to be cheated, after we had
firſt diſcovered that it was ſo; and that what
before was done covertly, and under
the Appearance of a Treaty, was now to
be done more effectually, openly, avowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in the Teeth of the reſt of the
Allies.</p>
            <p>This appeared upon the firſt Conference
after the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in their Paper of Explanation, as they
called it, on the Propoſals of the Peace,
which they had formerly given in. It came
then to the Turn of the Allies to conſider
in what manner to deliver in their Anſwer
to the <hi>French</hi> Propoſals; this it was reſolved
ſhould be by the Confederate Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
in their Demands, or the ſeveral
Pretenſions of their reſpective Principles,
without taking any Notice of the Project
contain'd in the Paper given in by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1146200300:29"/>
of <hi>France</hi>; it ſhould have been noted
here in the firſt Place, that after all the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had ſaid, and after all that had been
ſaid to them, in order to come to this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
prepared to preſerve a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
among the Allies, and to bring
the Treaty to the deſired Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi>
a good Peace: The <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
there without any Character, having
neither Powers as Plenipotentiaries, or as
Ambaſſadors, or any Thing more than
meer Commiſſioners, Empowered only
to hear what was ſaid, make Report
to their Maſters the States, and give back
their Anſwers, which one of the Queen's
common Meſſengers may as well do on our
Side. Nor were the Perſons, the Equipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or the Sallaries allowed to their ſaid
Commiſſioners, any more than what was
ſuitable to common Meſſengers, whoſe Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
it was to carry a Meſſage, and return
with an Anſwer; ſo that in the Conferences,
either General or Particular, there was no
debating Things with them, only juſt giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in what any one had to ſay, and all the
Anſwer theſe Men could give, was that
they would Report it to their High-Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes
the States General, and would bring
their Anſwer. The <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
preſently objected againſt theſe Powers,
as not ſufficient to admit the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
into the Conferences. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries,
tho' they were ſenſible of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1146200300:30"/>
Affront offered in it to their Royal Miſtreſs,
after ſuch Aſſurances on Her Majeſties Part,
of Her ſincere Intention to make the Intereſt
of all Her Allies to be as Her own, yet wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to wave every Thing that might give
an Obſtruction to the happy Iſſue of the
Peace, did not inſiſt on this; though they
could not but complain that it greatly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
that happy Concert of Meaſures,
which they hoped might have been the
conſtant Fruit of the private Conferences of
the Confederate Miniſters, which the <hi>Dutch</hi>
having no Powers that extended any farther
than barely to Hear, and Report, and bring
back a Reſolution; was for want of thoſe
Powers quite diſappointed; ſo that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters might as juſtly be deemed
and termed Porters, as Plenipotentiaries.
Well, notwithſtanding all this, the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Plenipotentiaries, willing to promote the
great End for which they aſſembled, which,
as the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol</hi> expreſt it,
was in the Name of God, to bring the Wars
to a happy Concluſion, in an Equitable and
Honourable Peace, all theſe Obſtructions
were paſt over on their Side, and they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to have the Powers of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
accepted, as at laſt they were, with
ſome Difficulty; and thus they proceed to
the Affair of the Demands, as above, which
were to be delivered in as the 5th of <hi>March.</hi>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters concealing the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
taken at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to give in no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1146200300:31"/>
but the very immediate Copy of
the Preliminaries laſt treated on, inſiſted that
all the Confederates Demands ſhould be
formed into one Inſtrument, and be given
in jointly by all the Plenipotentiaries, as the
general Demands of the whole Alliance.
This, tho' ſomething ſurprizing in itſelf, yet
was the leſs ſo, when it was more known
that this was, in order to execute the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
above noted, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of bringing in the
Preliminaries of <hi>Geertruydenbergh,</hi> as the
Summary Demands of the Allies. But the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries taking Notice of it,
inſiſted, that this ſeem'd to be deſtructive
of the Treaty itſelf, that <hi>France</hi> had Twice
ventured to carry on the War, rather than
agree to thoſe Preliminaries. That they had
been declared Impracticable, and could not
be treated on here; and to inſiſt on the very
literal Form of thoſe Preliminiaries now, and
preſcribe the Plenipotentiaries to treat on
them, was to declare againſt a Treaty at
all. That this Meeting was underſtood by
all Parties, to be not a Treaty of Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in order to a Treaty of Peace, but a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Treaty of Peace itſelf, wherein the
Specifick Demands of every Ally were to
be heard, debated, and finally diſcuſſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted,
and anſwered, to their Satisfaction,
which could by no Means be done by Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
Articles, which had in them ſeveral
References to a farther Treaty, and ſome
ſuggeſted Demands left to be farther diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1146200300:32"/>
at another Time; whereas they were
now met to make a final and general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all Demands and Pretenſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
that there might be no more Blood
ſhed in the Chriſtian World, that an
End might be put to the Miſeries of <hi>Europe</hi>;
it was alſo alledged, that the ſaid Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
had not been concerted with a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Intereſt of all the Allies; in
eſpecial Manner it was asked, what Article
there was to be found in them which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the Intereſt of Her <hi>Britannick</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
farther than what meerly reſpected
Her Title to the Crown, and the Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Pretender; whereas there ſeemed
a great deal of Reaſon for admitting farther
Demands for the Security, and enlarging the
Commerce and Poſſeſſions of Her Majeſty,
and Her Subjects; for this Reaſon, as
well as in Behalf of the reſt of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
the ſaid <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
upon giving in the Inſtrument of their
Demands in particular, every Ally by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>It
muſt be ſomething aſtoniſhing to ſuch
true Lovers of their Countrey, who can look
back on theſe Things with unprejudiced
Judgements, to reflect on the Temper reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Part of <hi>Europe</hi> at the Time of
the Treaty aforeſaid, when in all the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Articles adjuſted at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
debated again at <hi>Geertruydenberg</hi> by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1146200300:33"/>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> the former left out
nothing which concerned their own Intereſt,
Security or Advantage; nay, engaged the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Court to concern and engage themſelves
for their particular Security and Advantages,
but not one Word. Clauſe, Article, or Debate,
was ever thought of for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> either as
to the Security of their Commerce, as it then
ſtood, or the Encreaſe of it for the future.
On the other Hand, all the Streſs on the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Side, and for which we were to
think ourſelves infinitely obliged to the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> was to engage their Aſſiſtance to
keep out the Pretender, and ſecure the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to his
Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Hannover</hi>; a Thing
which is ſo the Univerſal Reſolution of all
the People and Parties in <hi>Britain,</hi> and to
which they think all the Oppoſition that can
be made from either <hi>French,</hi> or any elſe, is
ſo trifling and inſignificant, that they cannot
be ſenſible of the exceeding Obligation on
that Behalf to their Confederates, or of the
great Danger which they were in of
the Pretender, although no Foreign Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
had been engaged on that Behalf,
eſteeming the Favourers of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in <hi>Britain,</hi> not withſtanding their great
Clamours of a Party among us, to be
ſo ſew, and ſo inconſiderable, as that there
is nothing to be ſeared from them; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
there had been more Danger of this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1146200300:34"/>
Clauſe, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Succeſſion, then we are
willing to hope there is Ground to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it cannot but be reminded, that it
is as much the Intereſt of the States-General
to ſecure that Succeſſion in the Illuſtrious
Houſe of <hi>Hannover,</hi> as it is even of <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain</hi>
itſelf, and much more than it can
be ſuppoſed to be to <hi>Britain</hi> to ſecure to
them the Barrier of <hi>Flanders</hi>; for ſhould the
Dominions of her <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty ever
fall into the Hands of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
or into the Hands of a Prince, who is or
may be in the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of the States-General being ſtript of
the Powerful Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops
by Land, and Fleets by Sea, muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be expoſed to the Powerful Invaſion of
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleets united, and their
Trade in particular eaten up and deſtroyed,
as was verified by woful Experience to the
ſaid States in the Year 1672, when, if the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Court had not broken off from the
ſaid <hi>French</hi> Alliance, the States-General had
inevitably ſunk under the Power of <hi>France,</hi>
and their Government been diſſolved and
deſtroyed; ſo that upon the whole it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
there was no need on our Part to
engage the <hi>Dutch</hi> to appear for the Security
of our Succeſſion to the Houſe of <hi>Hannover</hi>;
for that the Sovereign Law of their own
Preſervation will always put them under a
Neceſſity of doing it, the contrary being
moſt ſure to be a great Step in their Injury,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1146200300:35"/>
if not their evident Deſtruction: It may be
argued, that in Rules of Government we
are not to depend upon this or that State
being obliged by their own Intereſt to aſſiſt
us, but we are to regard what Neceſſity,
either for Security of Trade, common Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Government, or other Political Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
we are in, or may be in, of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the Powers we are treating
with, and if that Neceſſity appears it is a
ſufficient Reaſon for us to ſecure that Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and this we have frequent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of, as of the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves treating
with us in 1676, when notwithſtanding it
was the undoubted Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> not
to let <hi>Holland</hi> upon any Terms whatever fall
into the Hands of <hi>France</hi>; and if ever the
<hi>French</hi> do again make that Attempt, we
ought to aſſiſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> with all our Troops
and Power; and that not ſo much from any
Care and Kindneſs to them as a Nation, but
for our own Intereſt and Preſervation; yet
the <hi>Dutch</hi> knowing the Eyes of a Nation are
not always open to their own Intereſt,
thought fit to tie us to aſſiſt them in that
Caſe, and even Articled with us for the
Proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Number of Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men. This is brought for a Reaſon
why, not withſtanding its being ſo much the
Intereſt of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> to preſerve
the Succeſſion of the Houſe of <hi>Hannover</hi> to
the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we ought alſo
to bind them to it by Treaty: But tho' we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1146200300:36"/>
were to grant all this, it will not follow that
this Treaty ſhould have ſuch a Price put
upon it, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould demand of
us all they want for this little Equivalent;
and the Reaſons above, tho' they ſhould
not be allowed to ſubſiſt againſt the Treaty
of Guarantee itſelf, will certainly take off
much of that High Price which the <hi>Dutch</hi>
have put upon it, as if we were under ſuch
Infinite Obligations to them to ſecure it for
us, as that we were quite out of Condition
to defend it ourſelves, or as if they had
no Concern, or were to receive no Security,
Benefit, or Advantage, at all by it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Again, it might paſs for ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in this Caſe, that if any Power in
<hi>Europe</hi> ought to have ſought this Guarantee
from the States-General, it ſhould have been
the Elector himſelf, who on his Part might
probably have ſome more Occaſion to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Paſſage over to <hi>England,</hi> and the
March of any Troops which his Highneſs
might find neceſſary to bring with him, to
aſſiſt his Faithful People of <hi>Britain</hi> to place
him on the Throne, in Caſe a <hi>French</hi> or
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt ſhould make Oppoſition.
Here indeed the States-General might be
very uſeful Allies, and his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would have thought very well of ſuch
a Guarantee of the States; but it cannot be
conceived that <hi>Britain</hi> can be under like
Neceſſity of ſuch a Security: The Succeſſion,
which is their own Act and Deed, being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1146200300:37"/>
approved by the whole Nation, a
few People excepted, who are contemptible
either for their Number or Intereſt; ſo
that on all theſe Accounts it ſeems however
a Treaty of Guarantee may be uſeful enough
for our Succeſſion, and no Harm in it; yet
it cannot be a Thing of that Weight as to
have ſo great a Value ſet upon it, and that
<hi>Britain</hi> ſhould ſuffer herſelf ſo much to be
impos'd upon for it, as it is apparent to all
the World ſhe has been on that Account.</p>
            <p>We return now to the Manner of the
carrying on of the Treaty of Peace at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht:</hi>
The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries having, as I
ſaid above, inſiſted upon the giving in the
Demands of the Allies in a ſeparate Manner,
have by this Means an Occaſion of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the Subjects of Her Majeſty ſome
other Advantages than by the former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was thought of; and the People of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
may now ſee, not only on what Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for us the former Treaty was nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
when we were to have our Markets
made for us by our <hi>Dutch</hi> Neighbours; but
they may ſee that all the Noiſe that hath
been made of the Preſent Miniſtry; and of
the preſent Managers being in the Intereſt
of <hi>France,</hi> amounts only to this, That
whereas the other gave up all our Intereſt to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the Emperor, theſe Men are
careful that <hi>Britain</hi> may reap ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
by the Treaty as well as the reſt of the
Confederates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1146200300:38"/>
Indeed it has been ſomething wonderful
in the common Diſcourſe of the People on
theſe Subjects to find the Generality poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by theſe ſelf-denying Notions, <hi>viz.</hi> that
all which can be obtained from <hi>France</hi> muſt
be given to the Emperor, and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but nothing to the
Queen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; as if our Strength
were no Acquiſition, or our Power any Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the Alliance; nay, rather, as if it were
dangerous to the Confederacy to entruſt any
Part of that we have fought ſo long for, and
bought ſo dear, to the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi>
One would think the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves
went on that Notion, when, as was apparent,
they appeared uneaſie and jealous at the
Preparations made by Her Majeſty to ſend a
Fleet and Forces to <hi>Canada</hi>; while not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Deſign, they apprehended it to be for
the taking Poſſeſſion of ſome Place or other
in the <hi>Spaniſh America,</hi> altho' by the <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>th
Article of the Grand Alliance it was agreed
that Her Majeſty might lawfully have done
ſo if ſhe had thought fit. Theſe Things,
however of no other Conſequence, yet
ſerve to let us ſee how different, as reſpecting
us, the Manner of the Allies hath been in all
the Tranſactions of this War, and how
different their Views have been in all their
Steps towards a Peace, from our conſtant
Behaviour in the ſame Heads as they reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them; and that in all theſe Occaſions
it has been the conſtant Maxim of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1146200300:39"/>
that we were to have no Share
in any Thing, but that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> under a
Notion of a Barrier and Security to their
Frontiers, ſhould make large Acquiſitions, both
to their Territory and their Commerce, both
which have been conſented to from hence;
whether it be to the Honour or to the Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of thoſe who have given in to theſe
Meaſures is left to the Impartial Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to determine: It is evident that at
length the Juſt Repreſentations of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Miniſters took Place, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> after
much Difficulty have yeilded that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Allies be given in to the <hi>French,</hi>
altho' in one and the ſame Inſtrument, yet
in ſeparate Heads; and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries
agree and propoſe to add at the
End of every Head this General <hi>and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of all the reſt of the Allies,</hi> a Clauſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to remove the Scandal and Reproach
early caſt upon the Preſent Management,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That they deſigned to make a Separate
Peace, and had actually concluded the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
there of with <hi>France</hi> before the Congreſs
was to begin; I muſt crave Pardon if I make
theſe ſeveral Inſtances of the Uſage of Her
Majeſty hath met with from Her Allies,
Rank in with their other Conduct relating
to Forces and Quota's, which have already
been made Publick, and all together to come
under the Title of Deficiencies; for if
there had been a more diſintereſted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of Counſel and Aſſiſtance of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1146200300:40"/>
in the Proceedings of the Allies, to
and with Her <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, and Her
Miniſters, no Queſtion this Treaty had
been with more Eaſe brought on, with
more Mutual Aſſiſtance to, and Confidence
in one another entred into, and perhaps
the Succeſs might have been more promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
alſo.</p>
            <p>There ſeems to be no Occaſion here of
Entring into the Clauſes which the <hi>Dutch</hi>
have obtain'd in any of their Treaties and
Agreements with us, by which they have
gain'd Advantages in Commerce, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to our Prejudice, becauſe even the
<hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves acknowledge them in
their late Letter to Her Majeſty; only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring.
That they do not deſign to take
the Advantage of thoſe Articles. I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
willing to believe the States-General, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
while a good Underſtanding among
the Allies, and particularly between Them
and Us, is ſo neceſſary to them, would not
make Uſe of the Advantages which were
given them by that Treaty; but this does
by no Means deny, nay, it not Tacitly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but even Explicitly, as it ſeems to Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Judgments, grants that ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
are given to the <hi>Dutch</hi> by that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
See the Declaration of the <hi>Dutch</hi> on
this Head more particularly, as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">'For having learnt that the Principal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
taken to the ſaid Treaty were,
that it might prove Prejudicial to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1146200300:41"/>
Commerce of Her Majeſty's Subjects in
the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi>; and that ſome
had entertain'd an ill-grounded and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Opinion, that the States might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to take Advantage by it to make
themſelves Maſters of the ſaid <hi>Spaniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
their High Mightineſſes did
declare poſtively, and by this Letter do
voluntarily repeat it, that it never was
their Intention, nor ever will be, to make
uſe of the ſaid Treaty, or of their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the Fortified Places of the Country,
to prejudice in any Manner the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of Her Majeſty's Subjects; but
that their Opinion is, That whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to Navigation and Commerce there,
ought to be ſettled on an intire Equality,
that ſo Her Majeſty's Subjects may not be
charged with higher Duties of Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Exportation than theirs, to the
end Commerce may be carried on there
by both Nations on an equal Foot.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the States-General acknowledge,
That whatever relates to Navigation and
Commerce in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi>
ought to be ſettled on an entire Equality:
This is owning what Her Majeſty has ſince
claimed to be Juſt, and yet that it has not
been ſo is apparent alſo; and in the ſame
Letter they acknowledge it again, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
<q rend="inline">'That if there be ſome Articles of
the ſaid Treaty which without affecting
the Eſſentials of it, may be thought to

is from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who indeed cannot be
ſuppos'd to be Ignorant of the Juſtice of Her

was evident at that Time, and therefore it
is that I cannot place it to the Account of

how willing ſoever in other Caſes to oblige

to have ſeiz'd upon the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi>
and have made themſelves entire Maſters
thereof; ſo that the preventing theſe Things
ſeems wholly owing to the Vigilance of
the Preſent Miniſtry, and to the vigorous
Reſolutions of the Preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>There ſeems indeed one Clauſe in the
ſaid Letter, which ſome People are very
forward here to take hold of; inſinuating,
That the <hi>Dutch</hi> complain of being trick'd
in <hi>England</hi> into a Conſent to a Negotiation
of Peace, by being put in Hopes, that after
they ſhould do ſo, the other Affair of the
Barrier ſhould be adjuſted to their Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1146200300:44"/>
the Words are theſe, <q rend="inline">'That however,
having not long ſince been inform'd, that
in <hi>England</hi> ſome were of Opinion, that
the ſaid Treaty in ſome Articles might be
prejudicial to Her Majeſty's Subjects,
the Commiſſioned M. <hi>Buys,</hi> their Envoy
Extraordinary then going to <hi>England</hi> to
inquire what thoſe Points were that might
be thought Grievances, and authorized
to treat about them with Her Majeſty's
Miniſters, and to remove, it poſſible, the
Difficulties by all the Explanations that
ſhould appear neceſſary; <hi>which they were
put in Hopes would not be very hard to do,
when once they ſhould have conſented to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with Her Majeſty, as they did, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Congreſs for the Negotiation of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Peace.</hi> But that the Misfortune
was, that the ſaid M. <hi>Buys,</hi> during his
Reſidence in <hi>England,</hi> was not able to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
that Affair to reciprocal Satisfaction;
and that it having been remitted to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> no Way has hitherto been found
to terminate it there neither; tho' their
High Mightineſſes think they have ſhewn
all the Readineſs to comply with any Juſt
Expedient that could reaſonably be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems to be very ill turn'd by a
Party among ourſelves, and implies, as they
pretend, as if the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court had made
Light of the Matter, and promiſed to adjuſt
it if the <hi>Dutch</hi> would do <hi>ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi>; but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1146200300:45"/>
that after the <hi>Dutch</hi> had complied and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
with Her Majeſty to procure a Congreſs
for the Negotiation of a General Peace,</hi> they
could never obtain the promiſed Condition,
altho they had ſhewn <q rend="inline">'all the Readineſs to
comply with any juſt Expedient that
could reaſonably be expected from them.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Black Charge, and had not the
<hi>Dutch</hi> with much more Integrity than theſe
People, anticipated this Calumny, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the true Reaſon for their ſaid Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with Her Majeſty, to be their Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Perſuaſion of the Abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
there was in the preſent Conjuncture,
for the Cultivating and <hi>Maintaining a good
Friendſhip, Perfect Confidence and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their ſaid States and Her Majeſty,</hi>
which for the better Authority, I give you
alſo from their own Letter, <q rend="inline">'That during
the whole Courſe of Her Majeſty's Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reign they have had nothing more
at Heart than to cultivate and maintain
with Her a Good Friendſhip, Perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and Union, and to corroborate
them the moſt they poſſibly could; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
always judged them abſolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and eſpecially in the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture.
That they likewiſe judged they
could not give a better Proof of this their
Diſpoſition and Perſuaſion, than that
which they lately gave in agreeing to the
Propoſition which Her Majeſty had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be made to them, to begin the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1146200300:46"/>
of a General Peace with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and in concurring with Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to facilitate the bringing together of
the Miniſters of all the High Allies to the
Congreſs at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This effectually Contradicts what as
before is ſuggeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were
induced <q rend="inline">'<hi>to concur with Her Majeſty, as
they did, to procure a Congreſs for the
Negotiation of a General Peace.</hi>'</q> Upon
their being put in Hopes that it would
not be very hard to do after they had
conſented ſo to concur with Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
I ſay, this is ſo contradicted by what
is ſaid before, that I was tempted to doubt
both the ſaid Paragraphs could not be in one
and the ſame Letter; and indeed it ſeems
ſhocking to any Reader, that their High
Mightineſſes ſhould ſay in one Part of their
Letter, that they concurr'd with Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<hi>to give the beſt Proof of their Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to cultivate a good Friendſhip, Perfect
Confidence and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Her Majeſty,</hi> and
in another Part of the ſame Letter to ſay,
that they concurr'd <q rend="inline">'<hi>with Her Majeſty, as

of a General Peace.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations being too hard for
my Underſtanding, are left to the Logical

it, and mumbled it, like an Aſs upon Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
will bring it out the ſame thorny crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Inconſiſtency that they found it.</p>
            <p>But while we are leaving them to this
difficult Work, it may be needful to look
farther, for we have yet much more Work
cut out from <hi>Holland</hi> than in the foregoing
Piece; the States-General having receiv'd
a new Bruſh from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament,
are very ſolicitous to waſh their Negro
Skin as clean as they can from the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which have lain ſo plainly againſt
them; but now they find it more difficult
than they did before; for till now they had
only Pamphlets and general Clamours to
anſwer, ſuch as the Suſpicions of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Information of a Few had
made loud; and which began to make them
uneaſy, theſe were treated with ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
by the States, and more by their
Friends here.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament finding more Truth
in theſe Things than perhaps they expected,
and much more than the Faction pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
thought it requir'd an Extraordinary
Sanction to make them leſs diſputed, and
thought it Juſt to make them Publick with an
undiſputed authority, that the People ought
to be undeceiv'd, and that the Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Truth of Fact ought to ceaſe among
the People; for this Reaſon, having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1146200300:50"/>
all the Particulars to be exactly and
faithfully laid before them, by the Report
of the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty,
and other proper Officers, and thoſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
to be critically examin'd, they dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from thence the Matters of Fact as they
really were, and making all the Caſes plain
in which the Government had been impos'd
upon by their Allies, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
among others; they came to ſeveral
Reſolves about the ſame, and drawing thoſe
Reſolves up into General Heads, referring
to the Particulars for their Demonſtration,
they Humbly repreſented all in an Addreſs
to Her Majeſty, and cauſed both the ſaid
Reſolves and the Addreſs to be Printed, for
the Conviction of all Her Majeſty's good
Subjects, and to confute and ſilence a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who, as aboveſaid, had made it their
Buſineſs to ridicule all that had been ſaid of
theſe Matters as falſe and empty Notions
infuſed into Peoples Heads, to raiſe ill
Blood and create Prejudices againſt the
<hi>Dutch.</hi> If theſe Things coming forth with
ſuch an undiſputed Authority did a little
ſurprize the World, and conſequently open
the Eyes of the People, much more would
they ſurpriſe the States-General, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
it had ſo long been to have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Britain</hi> kept as ignorant as poſſible of
theſe Matters; and finding it abſolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that ſomething ſhould be ſaid to
puzzle the Cauſe a little, and to furniſh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1146200300:51"/>
their Friends with Arguments for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
they iſſue a Paper, Entituled, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.<q>A Memorial, ſerving to prove that the States-General
of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited <hi>Netherlands</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
charged by the Reſolutions or Votes of
the Houſe of Commons of the Parliament of
<hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and by the Subſequent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of the ſaid Houſe of Commons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
preſented to Her Majeſty the Queen of
<hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with having been deficient in
divers Reſpects during the preſent War, in
furniſhing what according to their Quota or
Contingent they ſtood engaged for, towards
carrying on the ſaid War.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Paper which I come now to
examine, and in which if I ſhould diſcover
that the States-General have really been ſo
far from clearing themſelves of the Charge
ſo poſitively laid upon them in Parliament,
that in every Part they either directly or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
acknowledge it, then there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
little Force in the reſt of their Paper.</p>
            <p>In conſidering this New and Great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of the <hi>Dutch Memorial,</hi> it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proper to make as few Circumlocutions
as poſſible, and come directly to the Point.
Our Introduction therefore ſhall conſiſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of laying down a Liſt of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which we ſhall leave out, than of what
we ſhall put into the following Tract; what
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1146200300:52"/>
ſhall be dropp'd as foreign to the Caſe in
Hand, and not worth either the Author's
while to Note, or the Readers to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
about. As Firſt, It ſhall take up lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of our Time to animadvert on the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
Unparallell'd, of a Scandalous Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
who in Defiance of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and while that Parliament was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſitting, ſhould have the Face to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the Anſwer or Defence of a Foreign
Nation againſt his own Country.</p>
            <p>If a Man have receiv'd an Affront from
another, and meets one of his Servants,
and ſays to him, you <hi>Jack,</hi> or you <hi>Thomas,</hi>
pray tell your Maſter I ſay he is a Villain
and a Raſcal; will not the Servant if he
have any Manners or Senſe of his Duty ſay
to him, <hi>Sir,</hi> let him be what he will, he is
my Maſter, and it is not fit for me to tell
him ſo, pray employ Somebody elſe? On
the other Hand, if the Ignorant. Fellow
ſhould have ſo little Wit or Manners as to
carry this Meſſage to his Maſter, would not
the Maſter ſay to him, let the Man be what
he will, you are an Unmannerly Raſcal for
bringing me ſuch a Meſſage, ſince you
were my Servant, and not his? And would
he not very juſtly cane him, and turn him
out of his Service for his Impudence.</p>
            <p>This Caſe, as it is unprecedented, unleſs
in the ſame Perſon who did the like once
before, ſo it will be doubly unprecedented
in the Publick Juſtice, if he is uncorrected
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1146200300:53"/>
for it. Nay, by how much more the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
glory in and boaſt of having inſulted
the Parliament and the Government in this
Publication, by ſo much the more Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they bring upon the ſaid Parliament to
vindicate themſelves, and puniſh the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with their utmoſt Rigour: But this is
Humbly left and ſubmitted to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who no doubt will do themſelves
and their Defender Juſtice in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Next it ſhall take up no Part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to enquire whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
ordered theſe Sheets to be thus publiſhed in
<hi>England,</hi> or no. We are not ignorant how
many Ways of Late the Foreign Powers
concern'd in this War have privately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to make themſelves and their
Actings with Her Majeſty Popular here,
appealing at it were from Her Majeſty to
her Subjects; but we ſhall not ſuppoſe
however that they are yet arrived to ſuch
a Contempt of their Alliances with Her
<hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, as to appear in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which derogates ſo much from the uſual
Civilities due from one Ally to another, as
that they ſhould openly and avowedly
make an Attempt of this Nature.</p>
            <p>This Leads us to conſider how prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> has acted in
this Caſe, in which perhaps the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as
ſubtle a Nation as they are, and how good
ſoever their Politicks have been in other
Caſes, will be put to it, how to behave
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1146200300:54"/>
themſelves between the Two Extreams of
Owning or Diſowning this Publication of
their <hi>Memorial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament have firſt ſtigmatiz'd
the Paper itſelf as a <hi>Falſe and Scandalous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
but in this Cenſure they do not call it
the <hi>Memorial of the States-General,</hi> but a
<hi>Pretended Memorial:</hi> Now as the Lie is
here given by the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation,
and that moſt juſtly alſo, it remains for the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to ſhow us how they pleaſe to take
it; if they own the Paper and the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it here, they take the Lie aforeſaid
to themſelves, and are obliged to fall under
the Charge, huſh it up, and thereby own
in Juſt, or reſent it, which we ſuppoſe they
will conſider of, before they go about it.
On the other Side, if they take upon them
to mention, anſwer, or vindicate this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
they own not the Paper only, but the
mean Step of Cauſing it to be publiſhed in
<hi>England</hi> in eſpecial Inſult to Her Majeſty,
and to the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> then ſitting,
and what evil Conſequences may follow
ſuch a Thing muſt lye at their Doors. It
is true, that as the Parliament has not
thought fit to take it but as a ſpurious and
pretended Paper, we might very well do
ſo alſo; but as we ſee it publiſhed in all
Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as allow'd in thoſe Prints
in <hi>Holland,</hi> who are ſaid to write <hi>cum Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio</hi>;
and as it is in theſe Countries ſtiled,
<hi>The Anſwer of the States,</hi> &amp;c. we cannot
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1146200300:55"/>
but treat it as ſuch, or at leaſt as an Anſwer
<hi>for</hi> the States, if not, <hi>The Anſwer <hi>of</hi> the
States.</hi> And that this may be juſtified by
good Evidence, the Reader may obſerve,
that our Prints after the Reſentment of
the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> had made it too
dangerous for our Newſmen to go on
with the Printing it, gave this Account, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi>
4th.<q>Hague April 17. All our Publick Prints,
<hi>Publiſhed by Authority,</hi> have been
and continue full of the States Reply to
the Reſolutions of the Commons of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
in Vindication of their Conduct.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This we cannot but think gives ſufficient
Authority to a Writer, whether the States-General
are concern'd in the Publication at
<hi>London</hi> or no, to ſuppoſe them to be the
real Authors of the Paper itſelf, and that
it is really the <hi>States Reply,</hi> as above,
and as ſuch we ſhall therefore conſider it.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Thing meet for Obſervation in
it, is what we ought not by any Means to
paſs over, <hi>viz.</hi> That the States-General
confeſs the Charge, acknowledging the Fact,
directly, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Quota's for Sea Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
were not ſupply'd, or as the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Houſe of Commons expreſs it,
viz. <hi>That the States-General have been deſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in their Quota's for Sea Service in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1146200300:56"/>
               <hi>to the Numbers of Ships provided by Her
Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this the States in their <hi>Memorial,</hi> after
a very long Introduction, anſwer Two
Things; Firſt, That the Quota the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Court propoſed to fit out, particularly in
the Years 1704 and 1705, were too many,
or more than was needful for the Service;
<hi>viz.</hi> More than was needed to make the
Confederates Superior to the <hi>French</hi> in the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and that therefore they the
States did not think themſelves obliged to
furniſh ſo many. That whereas we ſhould
have Seventy-four Ships the Year 1704,
and Seventy-nine the Year 1705, they
thought the Rate of Twenty-four Ships of
their State a Proportion againſt Sixty of
Her Majeſty's, and that they concerted it
ſo with Admiral <hi>Mitchel.</hi> So that it is plain
here from this very <hi>Memorial,</hi> that the
States do no Manner of Way deny the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
itſelf, but evade the Force of the
Charge by Diſputing the Proportions; and
explaining what they underſtood by the
Two Fifths to Three Fifths, ſo inſiſted on
by the Parliament, and how they ought
to be underſtood by others. Again, they
would patch up the Deficiency aforeſaid,
by bringing in the Number of their Men
of War employ'd in the North Seas to
make up their Quota, and they expreſs this
very Subtilly, as a Thing which they think
ought to be ſet againſt the Number of Ships
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1146200300:57"/>
employ'd by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> in the Narrow
Seas; this may be conſider'd immediately
in their own Terms; but Firſt, it is fit to
Note, that both theſe Arguments confeſs
the Charge in Fact, only offer theſe Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
or Extenuations: So that the Truth
of what the Parliament has publiſh'd in
their Repreſentation and Addreſs ſtand faſt,
is acknowledg'd and confeſs'd by the States,
and needs no farther Defence. But it comes
next of Courſe to ſee what Force this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> as to their Ships in the
North Seas ought to have in this Argument;
and if it appears that theſe are not, and
ought not to be reckon'd in the Proportion
above, and that they were not reckon'd in
the Firſt Proportion ſtated and agreed with
the States-General, then all the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
drawn from thoſe Proportions will ſtand
the States in no Stead, as to any Defence to
be made by them againſt the Charge. In
the Examination of this, we meet with this
Clauſe in the State of Proportions laid before
the Houſe; by the Lords of the Admiralty,
which ſtands Diametrically Oppoſite to
what the States alledge in their <hi>Memorial,</hi>
in theſe Words, <hi>viz. That by the Treaties
between the Queen of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>and the
States-General, their Proportion of the Ships of
the Line of Battle, to act in Conjunction with
thoſe of this Kingdom in the</hi> Channel, <hi>and in
and about the</hi> Mediterranean, <hi>ought to be Three
to our Five.</hi> The Firſt Obſervation meet to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1146200300:58"/>
be made here, is, that the Treaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the
States, have expreſly ſettled their Reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Proportions, which indeed the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
ſeems to evade, by alledging, that in
the Grand Alliance the Reſpective Parties
were to aſſiſt with <hi>all their Forces</hi>; then
Complimenting <hi>Britain</hi> (I do not ſay Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering)
with being more Powerful than the
States, they thence deduce the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Forces of one being more than
the other. But the States-General would
think themſelves but ill anſwer'd if this
Way of Argument was made uſe of with
them, for what is all this to the Equality of
Proportions? Have not the <hi>Dutch</hi> always, as
the <hi>Memorial</hi> acknowledges, treated every
Year with the Queen upon the juſt Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of every Year's Service? And has not
the Queen ſent Admiral <hi>Mitchel</hi> always to
ſettle that Point? Now the preſent Queſtion
is not whether Nation is moſt Powerful, or
whether we are to ſend more Troops than
the States-General, or more Ships; but
whether the Proportions being ſettled An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
by Agreement, the States-General
have ſupply'd the Numbers agreed on by
thoſe Treaties, and ſent as many as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to ſend or no; if they have done this,
then it is true, the Firſt ſettled Proportions
are of no Weight. On the other Hand, if
they have not the General Treaty of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polying
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1146200300:59"/>
all their Forces, or any other are
Equally of no Force.</p>
            <p>Now it is apparent that the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
have not ſupply'd their Quota of Ships
for the Services for which they agreed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them, and therefore we on our Side juſtly
Complain, and the Account as it was laid
before the Houſe by the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Admiralty, and by Her Majeſty
Command, is very plain in the Caſe,
admitting of no Diſpute; wherefore we
have for a further and more effectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
the Advocates for the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in this Caſe, cauſed it to be annexed at
large, and is as follows.<q>By the Lords Commiſſioners for Executing
the Office of Lord High Admiral of
<hi>Great-Britain, Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. of all Her

            </p>
            <p>HER Majeſty's Pleaſure having been
ſignify'd to Us by Mr Secretary <hi>St. John,</hi>

Ships and thoſe of Her Allies during

            <p>That ſince the Commencement of this

adjuſt with the States-General or their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
the Quota's of their Ships of War
to act in Conjunction with thoſe of Her

in Purſuance of thoſe Treaties was ſent to
Her Majeſty's Principal Secretary of State,
to which we Humbly refer.</p>
            <p>And as to the Number of Ships in the

               </gap>d
to Her Majeſty's on the foremention'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
the ſame will appear by the following
Account, which hath been computed with
as much Exactneſs as the Nature of the
Things will bear, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Year 1702,
Her Majeſty had Forty four Ships employ'd
in the <hi>Channel</hi> and <hi>Soundings</hi> of the Line of
Battel, and Thirty in and about the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi>
making in the whole Seventy-four,
and they were join'd with no more
than Thirty-three of the States-General,
whereas they ſhould have been Forty-four.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1146200300:61"/>
1703, Seventy-nine of Her Majeſty's
Ships were employ'd in the aforeſaid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and but Twenty-two of the States-General,
which ſhould have been Forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven.</p>
            <p>1704, There was Seventy-four of the
Queen's Ships and Eighteen <hi>Dutch,</hi> which
ſhould have been Forty-four.</p>
            <p>1705, Seventy-nine of Her Majeſty's
Ships and Twenty-eight <hi>Dutch,</hi> which
ſhould have been Forty-ſeven.</p>
            <p>1706, There were but Fifteen Ships of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> acted in Conjunction with Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eight
of the Queen's Ships, whereas they
ſhould have been Forty-ſix.</p>
            <p>1707, To Seventy-two of Her Majeſty's,
they were no more than Twenty-ſeven of
the States-General, inſtead of Forty-three.</p>
            <p>1708, The States-General join'd Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five
Ships of the Line to Sixty-nine of Her
Majeſty's, inſtead of Forty-two.</p>
            <p>1709, No more than Eleven Ships of the
States were join'd to Sixty-ſeven of the
Queen's, inſtead of Forty-three.</p>
            <p>1710, Her Majeſty had Sixty-two em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in the aforeſaid Service, and the
States-General appointed no more than
Thirteen to act in Conjunction with them,
inſtead of Thirty-ſeven.</p>
            <p>1711, There was no more than Twelve
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships inſtead of Thirty-five appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to act with Fifty-nine of the Queen's
Ships, which as well as thoſe in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1146200300:62"/>
Year were employ'd in the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi>
and not ſo much as one allotted by
the States-General to act in Concert with
thoſe of Her Majeſty againſt the Enemies
Ships at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and in the <hi>Channel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here ſeemeth a moſt convincing Proof of
the Matter of Fact. Now let us ſee what
<hi>Dutch</hi> Cunning will bring them off of this,
for it is a home Charge, and they will not
eaſily parry the Thruſt. The <hi>Memorial</hi> in
Truth does not attempt it, and therefore
the Matter of Fact as I ſaid before ſtands
granted. But they plead then that we have
not treated them fairly, for ſay they, <q rend="inline">'Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It muſt be obſerv'd, that in the
aforeſaid Account Notice is taken only of
the Ships of this State, which in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with thoſe of Her Majeſty were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in the <hi>Mediterr anean</hi> and the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
and that the North Sea, which this
State, during the War, has generally had
the Care of, is wholly omitted: Which
Mention of thoſe Ships only of this State
which have acted in Conjunction with
thoſe of Her Majeſty, and the Omiſſion
of the North Sea, make ſo great a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Number of Ships
reckoned by the foreſaid Account to have
been furniſhed by <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that
ſaid in the ſame Account to be furniſhed by
this State, that probably this Difference
gave Occaſion to the forming the foreſaid
prejudicial Reſolution or Vote of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1146200300:63"/>
Lower Houſe, which poſſibly would not
have been formed, might this State have
firſt been heard upon it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Plea needs no farther Examination
than to look back to the Second Paragraph
of the Admiralty's Report above, where it
is affirm'd, <q rend="inline">'That by the Treaties between
the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the States-General,
their Proportion of Ships of the
Line of Battle to act in Conjunction with
thoſe of this Kingdom in the <hi>Channel</hi> and
in about the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> ought to be
Three to our Five.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be ſurprizing to all that read the
<hi>Memorial</hi> of the States, to hear them inſiſt
with ſo many Introductory Paragraphs, and
lay ſo much ſtreſs upon their Employing
Ships in the North Seas, when it is thus
proved that the North Seas are quite left
out of the Queſtion, and the Treaties they
had made were only for Ships to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<hi>in the Channel in and about the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean.</hi>
Now if they have furniſhed their
Quota as agreed upon with us for the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>
and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> tho' they had ſent
no Ships to the North Seas, we conceive
the Commons had made no Repreſentation;
nor had they any Reaſon, for there was no
mention of it in the Agreements of Treaties
aforeſaid; but if they have not furniſhed
their Quota's for the <hi>Channel,</hi> altho' they
had ſent an Hundred Sail to the North Seas,
it had been nothing to the Caſe any more
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1146200300:64"/>
than their ſending Ships to <hi>Batavia,</hi> for the
ſame Reaſon as above; the North Sea
Guard being not mention'd in the ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Annual Agreements. To what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then is all the long Deſcription of the
Neceſſity of the ſending Ships to the North
Seas? And what can be more ſurprizing than
to find their High Mightineſſes arguing
what <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>was</hi> their Sentiments, againſt
what <hi>is</hi> and <hi>was</hi> at that very Time <hi>concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>adjuſted</hi> by them, with the Perſons
actually ſent over by the Queen of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
for that Purpoſe; and which in the
very ſame Paragraph they acknowledge
was ſo <hi>concerted</hi> and <hi>adjuſted.</hi> For the more
ready aſſiſting the Reader to make a Full
and Free Judgment hereof, the long pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Defence on that Head is here copied out
of the ſaid <hi>Memorial,</hi> and is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q rend="inline">'It muſt be obſerv'd, That by the Seventh
Article of the Treaty of the Ninth of
<hi>June</hi> 1703, by which that Agreement
was renewed, 'Tis provided, that the
Number of Ships of War to be furniſhed
by each for their whole Quota according
to the ſaid Agreement, ſhould be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every Year, and that the Rendezvous,
as well as the Places where the Ships
ſhould be employed, ſhould likewiſe be
agreed upon every Year; accordingly this
has been concerted Yearly, Her Majeſty
having to that Purpoſe for ſeveral Years
ſent over one of Her Admirals, at which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1146200300:65"/>
Times Two Things principally were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into Deliberation, namely, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Shipping and the Places where they
ſhould be employ'd; upon which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
on the Part of Her Majeſty propoſed
commonly the employing a greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than was propoſed by this State, and
alſo more Regard was had to the <hi>Channel</hi>
than to the North Sea, of which North
Sea not the leaſt Mention is made in the
aforeſaid Account of the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
of the Admiralty, from which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
it partly comes that they reckon
ſo low what this State has furniſhed to
the Sea-ſervice. The Sentiment of this
State upon this Subject has alway been,
that the Number of Ships to be ſent Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Sea ought to be regulated according
to the Force which it might reaſonably
be judged the Enemy could Yearly bring
into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> the <hi>Channel,</hi> and
the North Sea, ſo that Men might be
morally ſure that the Fleets and Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
which on the Part of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
and this State ſhould act in Conjunction
or Seperately, would be ſuperiour to thoſe
of the Enemy. The Term, in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or Separately, was uſed, becauſe it
was ever the Opinion of this State, that
Her Majeſty's Ships, and thoſe of this
State, ſent to <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi>
ought to act in Conjunction;
and that the Security of the <hi>Channel</hi> ought
to be left to the Care of Her Majeſty,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1146200300:66"/>
and that of the North Sea to the Care of
this State, becauſe the <hi>Channel</hi> is beſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
for <hi>Great-Britain</hi> with reſpect to its
Countries, Harbours, and Commerce, and
the North Sea for this State with reſpect
to its Countries, Harbours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
yet ſo, that if unexpectedly the
Enemy ſhould bring any Fleet or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Squadrons into the <hi>Channel,</hi> or
into the North Sea, then the Squadrons
on both Sides, in Whole or in Part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Circumſtances of Affairs,
might join each other.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerved here, the States General
Firſt acknowledge in this Paragraph of
their <hi>Memorial,</hi> That <hi>both the Number of
Ships to be furniſh'd by each Party, and the
Places where thoſe Ships ſhould be employ'd,
was concerted Yearly, Her Majeſty having to
that Purpoſe for ſeveral Years ſent over one
of Her Admirals:</hi> Nay, they repeat it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>viz. At which Times Two Things prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
were taken into Deliberation,</hi> viz. <hi>The
Number of Shipping, and the Places where
they ſhould be employ'd.</hi> We can have no
Occaſion to make Anſwer to this in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Manner than by Appeal to the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General
themſelves, and Enquiring then
whether in the Quota's of Ships at thoſe
Times agreed on, and the Place where they
ſhould be employ'd, any Place but the
<hi>Channel</hi> and in and about the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>
was ever included or incerted: If it were,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1146200300:67"/>
then we muſt give it againſt the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Houſe of Commons, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
the States-General: But if not, what
means all the Preamble and Circumlocution
of this long <hi>Memorial?</hi> And to what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is it ſaid this or that was the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the States-General? The Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
and Addreſs of the Commons,
and the Report of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Admiralty,
can ſay nothing to what was, or was not,
the Sentiments of the States-General. But
to what was their Agreement, and what
was concerted Yearly between the Queen of
<hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the States, that they
may enquire about, and that they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
Fairly and Faithfully, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not furniſhed the Quota's
which they were obliged by Treaty to do,
for the Service of the Conſederates in the
<hi>Channel,</hi> and in or about the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>;
what they did in the North Seas
as being no Part of the ſaid Agreement,
the ſaid Repreſentation has no Ground to
meddle with it, nor does it take the leaſt
Notice of it as is ſuppoſed for that Reaſon.</p>
            <p>It may not be foreign to this Caſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a little here into the Reaſon and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
alſo of this Argument about the
North S as Service, in doing whereof, if it
ſhall be found that this Service ought not
to be thought of in Eſtabliſhing the ſaid
Quota's of Ships, as being wholly and ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Work of Intereſt, Protecting their own
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1146200300:68"/>
Commerce Fiſhing, <hi>&amp;c</hi> in which the Allies
have no Concern, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
at the ſame Time ſeveral Squadrons in thoſe
Seas which were never eſteemed Part of
the ſaid Quota on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Side, and
therefore that the like ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on on the Part of the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
then all the Argument drawn from
theſe Things will fall to the Ground, and
the Impreſſions which thoſe Reſolutions
of the Houſe of Commons have made on
the People muſt neceſſarily remain.</p>
            <p>It is not queſtion'd at all, nor does it
ſeem material to this Caſe, but that in the
ſeveral Alliances made between <hi>England</hi>
and the States-General they were Mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblig'd to aſſiſt each other with <hi>all their
Forces.</hi> But this is ſo far from taking off
the Edge of the Complaint, that it rather
fixes and confirms the ſame; for that we
alledge that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not aſſiſted
with all their Forces, and to determine the
Signification of the ſaid Term, and how
the ſame is to be underſtood, we are to
obſerve, that leſt it ſhould create here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
any Miſunderſtanding among the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
the ſeveral Quota's or Proportions of
the Allies were ſettled between every the
particular Nations Annually. Now the
Parliament's Complaint is clear in this, nor
does the <hi>Memorial</hi> of the States offer one
Word of Anſwer to it; they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
in general, that the States have not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1146200300:69"/>
ſupply'd their whole Forces, but that they
have not ſupply'd thoſe ſeveral Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by which their whole Forces were by
vertue of their Subſequent Agreement to be
underſtood; and this appears from the very
<hi>Memorial</hi> itſelf, where their High Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
acknowledge it, and better Proof
cannot be deſired. See their own Words.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">'By the Seventh Article of the Treaty
of the Ninth of <hi>June</hi> 1703, by which
that Agreement was renewed, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that the Number of Ships of War
to be furniſhed by each for their whole
Quota according to the ſaid Agreement
ſhould be regulated every Year, and that
the Rendezvous, as well as the Places
where the Ships ſhould be employed,
ſhould likewiſe be agreed upon every
Year; accordingly this has been concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Yearly, Her Majeſty having to that
Purpoſe for ſeveral Years ſent over one
of Her Admirals, at which Times Two
Things principally were taken into Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
namely, the Number of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and the Places where they ſhould
be employ'd.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is acknowledg'd by the States
that the Quota's were adjuſted between us
and them, both as to Number of Ships,
and where to be employ'd. There are but
Two Objections which the <hi>Memorial</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make after this, the Firſt is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Ships which the States furniſhed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1146200300:70"/>
for the Guard of the North Seas ſhould
not be eſteemed Part of their Quota, and
Secondly, Whether the Number of Ships
mentioned to be employ'd by Her Majeſty
in the <hi>Channel</hi> and in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>
were neceſſary; theſe are alſo their own
Words, to which may be briefly anſwer'd,
Firſt, That after they had acknowledged,
as above is ſaid, That <hi>the Number of Ships
and Places where the ſame ſhould be employ'd
were every Year concerted,</hi> it can no more
be asked whether they were neceſſary; the
Queſtion rather lyes fairly, Whether the
Numbers concerted were reſpectively ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
if there had appear'd any ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Alteration in the Face of the War.
So that if it had ſeem'd to the States leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſend ſo large a Number of Ships
as was agreed, it muſt have been reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that a new Concert between the Allies
ſhould have been made, and ſome mutual
Agreement offer'd for leſſening the ſaid
Number on both Sides. But to agree Firſt
that ſuch a Number on both Sides ſhould
be ſupplied, and then ſhortning that
Number on their Side, without ſignifying
to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court that they thought few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Ships enough, ſo that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhould
be left to ſend their full Quota as agreed,
and the States only make an Abatement,
this can be no Fair Treatment of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi>
nor is it eſteemed fair Dealing in our
Country, whatever it may be in <hi>Holland</hi>;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1146200300:71"/>
therefore the Complaint of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in this Caſe ſeems very juſt, and is
not at all anſwer'd by this <hi>Memorial,</hi> for
that the States-General did not ſupply the
Number of Ships which by their Annual
Agreement was concerted between them
and Her Majeſty; Secondly, But ſay the
States, we did ſupply a great Squadron in
the North Seas, which ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Part of our Proportion, and all the
Reaſons given for this Way of acting are,
that ſuch were the Sentiments of the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General;
yet in another Part of the ſaid
<hi>Memorial</hi> it is own'd, and in the Report
of the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty it
is expreſly ſaid, thoſe Quota's were ſettled
only for ſuch Ships as were to act Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly
or Separately in the <hi>Channel</hi> and the
<hi>Mediterranean.</hi> But becauſe this Argument
is of too much Value to have it depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the dubious Conſtruction of Terms, it
may be obſerv'd, Firſt, That there is no
Parity or Equality in this Argument, for
that the Concert of Proportions of Ships
to be ſupply'd by us and the States re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
only the particular Seas, in which
the Power of the <hi>French</hi> was particularly
Formidable, and where their main Fleets
were to be expected, as in the <hi>Streights,</hi>
and the <hi>Channel,</hi> or on the Coaſts of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
and <hi>Spain.</hi> And that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation
have kept great Squadrons and Fleets out
in ſundry other Parts of the World, as the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1146200300:72"/>
               <hi>Dutch</hi> have done in the <hi>North Sea,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reckoning any ſuch Ships into the
Quota or Proportions of the Fleets to be
furniſhed as before, for the Carrying on
the War, ſuch have been the Fleets and
Ships conſtantly ſent to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
to <hi>St. Helena,</hi> to the <hi>Canaries,</hi> &amp;c. by
which it appears, that whatever the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> have been,
as above, the Sentiments of the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Court have always been, that each Ally
ought to have ſupply'd their full Quota of
ſuch Ships as were concerted for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the War in the <hi>Channel</hi> and in the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> without eſteeming ſuch
Ships as Part thereof which they reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were obliged to furniſh for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Commerce in any other Part
of the World; and that this was the real
Sentiments of the States-General as well as
of Her Majeſty, appears for that in all the
Ships ſent by either of the Powers into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts of the World, as into the North
Seas, the <hi>Baltick,</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Indies, St. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi>
and the like, they very ſeldom acted
in Conjunction, but ſent their reſpective
Squadrons ſeparately, as the Neceſſity of
their Affairs requir'd. Nor did thoſe Ships
act in Conjunction on any Occaſion, ſave
only as they found it neceſſary to take the
Ships of each other Nation under Convoy,
or in their Protection, and made uſe of
the Harbours of each Confederate as there
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1146200300:73"/>
might be Occaſion. This is manifeſt, in
that notwithſtanding the great Fleets
which the States-General have upon all
Occaſions ſent to the North Seas, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court have been oblig'd
alſo to ſend Annual Squadrons to thoſe
Seas for the Safety of their Trade, as well
to <hi>Ruſſia</hi> as to the <hi>Eaſt-Country,</hi> the <hi>Elbe</hi>
and the <hi>Weſer,</hi> as alſo for the Defence of
the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; which
Ships, tho' equal, if not ſuperiour, to the
Numbers ſent into thoſe Seas by the States-General,
have not been accounted by Her

               </gap>ſty as any Part of the Proportion of
Ships concerted as aboveſaid with the
States.</p>
            <p>This therefore can never be the Reaſon
of the Report of the Commiſſioners of
the Admiralty; and it is ſurprizing to
all thoſe who know the State of thoſe
Things, to hear the <hi>Memorial</hi> ſay, the
States General had the Care of the North
Seas, as they do when they ſum up that
Part of their Caſe as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'It muſt

            <p>Thus by the plaineſt Reaſoning in the
World the <hi>Memorial</hi> is fallacious, for that
the Deſiciencies complain'd of remain
conſeſt by the States themſelves, the
Reaſons pretended to juſtify themſelves
are directly contrary to the concerted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
and Treaties made between the
ſaid States-General and the Queen's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1146200300:75"/>
and this is exactly agreeable to
the Report of the Commiſſioners of the
Admiralty, and the Reſolutions of the
Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>The like fallacious Way of Arguing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Caſe of the Land-Forces or
Troops, in which ſtill their High Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes
do not deny the Matter of Fact
alledged in the ſaid Addreſs, but excuſe
and extenuate the ſame by their Efforts
otherways, as particularly, they alledge
an Article of their Raiſing Troops before
us, and this they ſay deſerves ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation;
<hi>that is,</hi> that they having rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Fifty Thouſand Men before us, they
ſhould be therefore allowed to maintain
Fewer than they agreed for afterwards;
or to ſpeak plainly, that becauſe they
were obliged to a quicker Armament than
the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> therefore they were to have
leave to break in upon future Concert,
and fail in the Numbers they were to
bring in afterward: This ſeems no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
Conſtruction of the Firſt Clauſe of
the <hi>Memorial</hi> relating to the Troops, which
is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">'In the Firſt Place, it muſt not be
omitted to obſerve on the ſaid Eſtimate,
that in the general Charge for the
Year 1701, the Forty-four Thouſand
Nine Hundred Ninety-two Men which
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited-Netherlands</hi> kept up after the
Peace of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> are mixed with the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1146200300:76"/>
Thirty-four Thouſand Eight Hundred
Sixty-ſix Men which were taken into
Service immediately after the Death of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain</hi>; and
that for the Year 1702, not only the
Troops which this State took into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that Year, but thoſe hired the
Beginning of the foregoing Year, are
reckon'd all together; which if put down
more diſtinctly would have ſhewn, that
this State had reinforced their I roops
with above Fifty Thouſand Men a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Time before <hi>Great-Britain</hi> came
to make any particular Augmentation;
which earlier Arming, to the exceſſive
Expence of this State, well deſerved to
be allowed for by ſome kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>What can the Words <hi>deſerve ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi>
be ſuppos'd to ſignify, but that
the States-General concluded from thence
that their future Deficiency was to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
becauſe of their more Arming than
the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> Which any one that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
the Occaſion may find other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to give for, and which the States-General
themſelves ſeem to acknowledge,
or at leaſt to hint at, which was in ſhort,
that the Parliament and People of <hi>England</hi>
did not come into the Meaſures for the
laſt War, or perhaps believe it ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
at firſt as the States did, and
therefore did not Vote ſuch large Sums
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1146200300:77"/>
for their Proportion as the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
requir'd, and this they now alledge
ſhould be made up afterwards. This is
gathered from the following Words in
the <hi>Memorial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">'This State were obliged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with <hi>Great-Britain's</hi> furniſhing in
the Beginning of the War no more
than Forty Thouſand Men in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
in ſo great a Diſproportion
with reſpect to this State; not becauſe
there was any Convention or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made about it, or that it was
at all reaſonable, but becauſe no more
was conſented to by the Parliament,
the Reaſons of which are probable freſh
ſtill in the Remembrance of many;
and at that Time the only Courſe
this State could take, was to burthen
itſelf with ſo great a Diſproportion,
and to wait till in the Continuance of
the War it ſhould be made good to
them'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This may imply that the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
deſired to have this Diſproportion
made good to them afterwards by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> but does not prove that it
ought to have been made good, or that
the Queen of <hi>Great-Britian</hi> had agreed
to make it good much leſs did it ſignifie
that they were thereby Entituled to make
it good to themſelves by a Deficiency in
ſuch Quota's and Proportions as they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1146200300:78"/>
ſhould agree afterwards to bring into the
Field.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then it ſeems the
Sum of the Caſe is this, that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
have really been Deficient in the ſaid Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,
but that according to their own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they might lawfully be ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
expreſs Treaties and Conventions
to the contrary; and that theſe Sentiments
ariſe from their thinking fit to make Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal
or Stoppage upon <hi>England,</hi> for the
<hi>Dutch</hi> coming into the War a Year before
us; and becauſe we did not think fit to
come into the Alliance ſooner, they are
making us pay for our ſtanding out.</p>
            <p>More or leſs than this cannot be made of
their long <hi>Memorial,</hi> and as to the Juſtice
and Equity of this the World is left to judge
of that Affair.</p>
            <p>The Author of this had reſolved to add
here ſome Remarks about the Pretence of
carrying on the War with all their Forces;
and the States ſaying that <hi>Britain</hi> is more
Powerful, and therefore muſt bring in more
Forces, making themſelves Judges of who
is, or is not, moſt Powerful; but Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Anſwer to the States, ſince publiſhed,
has made this ſo clear, and preſt it ſo cloſe
upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that it ſeems needleſs to
ſay any more to that Point.</p>
