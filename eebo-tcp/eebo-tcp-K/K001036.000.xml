            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I HOPE you will not be offended at the liberty I take in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the following Work to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—And I am the rather confirmed in this hope as well from its Name, <hi>An Eſſay on Humanity,</hi> as its object, ſo virtually cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with ſuch name.—</p>
            <p>It has been remarked of Authors, that their writings were the juſteſt deſcription of their diſpoſitions, and I think the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation may with great propriety be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to their Patrons; for, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of human concerns, I believe there has ſeldom a work been inſcribed to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, the qualities of whoſe mind, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of whoſe heart, did not bear a congenial relationſhip to the ſubject treated of. The Gentleman, which I now have the honor and happineſs to addreſs, is a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing example of the juſtice of this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe private life is one uniform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0490200500:3"/>of the diffuſive virtues of generoſity and benevolence. It is upon this expanded principle, Sir, that I ground my hopes of your indulgence in patronizing—An Eſſay on Humanity, and which, by a ſpecies of relative attraction, you have drawn to ſeek ſhelter under your foſtering protection.</p>
            <p>I muſt here reſtrain the effuſions of a grateful mind, leſt malignity might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue the genuine language of heart-felt gratitude into unworthy adulation—which I am perfectly confident, you are as much averſe to receive as I am to offer:—Juſtice, however, demands this public declaration, that whatever benefit (which I hope will not be inconſiderable) may hereafter reſult to ſociety from the preſent Performance, will be, principally, attributable to you in conſequence of your liberality to the author.—</p>

            <head>To the PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>AS the inſtitution of public charities is univerſally applauded, ſo their abuſe ſhould be univerſally condemned: to correct, therefore a public evil of this tendency is the object of the following ſheets.</p>
            <p>The nation is loud in its praiſes on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of the Humane Society, inſtituted for the recovery of perſons <hi>apparently</hi> dead; and certainly praiſe could never be more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly beſtowed nor more juſtly merited. As a grateful individual of ſociety, it claims my particular veneration: and as the plan which I have recommended here, is projected upon the ſame principles of indiſcriminate benevolence, I fondly anticipate a portion of the public approbation for attempting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a public good.</p>
            <p>The Humane Society may in the exerciſe of <hi>ten</hi> experiments be ſucceſsful perhaps but in <hi>one,</hi> their exertions are nevertheleſs laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: but the inſtitution of a <hi>Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> (which I have in the courſe of this Eſſay recommended to be appointed in hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals) may exerciſe the functions, annexed to it with greater probability of ſucceſs, as, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that in <hi>ten</hi> attempts to reſtore health and prolong life, <hi>one</hi> will not miſcarry. As therefore the object of the <hi>Humane Society</hi> is to reſcue from premature death our fellow-creatures, ſurely that inſtitution formed upon
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0490200500:5"/>ſimilar principles of univerſal benevolence and which has in its comprehenſion the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſaving Ten for one of the human race, muſt be allowed a decided ſuperiority, and conſequently command a proportionate earneſtneſs in its being eſtabliſhed into a ſyſtem of permanency.</p>
            <p>I am well apprized, that imputations ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt public inſtitutions, or public characters, are generally ſuppoſed to "take their riſe in envy or diſappointment, and not from any diſintereſted or public ſpirited mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives." How far the degeneracy of human-nature will juſtify ſuch an illiberal charge, it is not for me here to inveſtigate, therefore ſhall not attempt to refute the injuſtice, or acknowledge the propriety of it: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I think it abſolutely neceſſary thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to declare, that ſuch motives have not the leaſt influence, either immediate or remote, in the preſent undertaking, and that however ſingular the licentiouſneſs of the times may make the declaration appear, I profeſs myſelf a volunteer in the cauſe of humanity only.</p>
            <p>Upon this principle it will not be eſteemed preſumptious to hope, that this pamphlet will obtain a diſpaſſionate inveſtigation from the benevolent governors and ſubſcribers to the different hoſpitals in and about London, and alſo a candid examination of its utility from a diſcerning, generous, and impartial public, whoſe judgment I hope, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0490200500:6"/>will be directed by the magnitude of the object recommended by it, and for whoſe benefit it is avowedly written.</p>
            <p>I alſo think it neceſſary to declare, that I was not influenced by any general diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation I did or do entertain of the profeſſion of phyſic or ſurgery, or againſt any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar profeſſor of thoſe half-divine arts; on the contrary, it has ever been my opinion, that benevolent and intelligent phyſicians and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, were characters that gave additional dignity to human nature: but the gentlemen of the faculty themſelves will be my witneſſes, when I ſay that there are ſeveral characters in the profeſſion who do not come ſtrictly under this venerated denomination; and in whoſe hands a man's life would be in as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as his property in thoſe of an unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled pettifogging attorney.</p>
            <p>The ſarcaſms ſo liberally thrown out againſt both profeſſions, are the greateſt pannigerycks upon the reſpectable part of the profeſſors.— It is only for ignorance, inſenſibility and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, to ſmart under the rod of ſatyrical chaſtiſement, intelligence, humanity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity will be ever above its reach.</p>
            <p>That want of literary merit which muſt ever diſtinguiſh maiden productions (and which is ſo very conſpicuous in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſſay) will I hope in ſome meaſure be overlooked by the critic eye of claſſical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0490200500:7"/>in conſideration of the benignity of its intention; for though my capacity in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying this ſubject in the affecting colours it would admit of, is inferior to many, yet, in a benevolent anxiety for its happy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, I am inferior to none:—For if ever I could entertain ſo inordinate a wiſh, as to be poſſeſſed of the captivating, pathetic, and perſuaſive eloquence of Mr. Burke, it would be, that I might (like him) with more ſucceſs plead the cauſe of humanity.</p>
            <p>The antient Romans, the moſt unſullied model of human perfection which hiſtory preſents us with, carried their love of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to ſo exalted a pitch, that they decreed the particular honor of a civic crown to every individual who ſhould ſave the life of <hi>one</hi> citizen. This was a generous incitement,— an honorable ſtimulative to the virtues of humanity and benevolence! And as the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation is the only living copy on the face of nature of ſo illuſtrious an original, I hope that my feeble endeavours, which are level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the preſervation of the lives of <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> of my fellow-citizens and fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (in future) will entitle me to the more <hi>envied diſtinction</hi>—their approbation. And though I ſhould not be ſo happy as to gain this flattering reward—yet I ſhall not relax my perſeverence in endeavouring to deſerve it, by availing myſelf of every opportunity of diſcharging the benevolent duties of A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON HUMANITY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is no leſs a compliment to the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and wiſdom, than to the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Great Britain, that it takes prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all other ſtates in Europe for the number, variety, and affluence of its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable inſtitutions. The large voluntary ſubſcriptions in ſupporting hoſpitals for every ſpecies of calamity, entailed on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, excite ſentiments of the moſt exalted ſenſibility in the feeling breaſt.— All benevolent deſcriptions of mankind muſt ſympathetically partake of bleſſings thus indiſcriminately diffuſed. And though our feelings may be wounded, either by the ſight or recital of the afflictions inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the conſtitution of human nature, yet we are in a great meaſure conſoled by the reflection, that theſe manſions of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality are erected for their alleviation.— The great maſs of mankind ever has been, and ever will be, formed of two compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts, good and bad.—The one ever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0490200500:9"/>ſolicitous to promote the happineſs of their fellow-creatures; the other to counteract theſe laudable efforts. This is a truth ſo well eſtabliſhed by the experience of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ages, that a further commentation on it here, might be juſtly conſidered an impertinent prolixity. I am led to this reflection from the wanton abuſe which is known but too generally to prevail in the above mentioned god-like inſtitutions.— Where avarice and inſenſibility in the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſervants (not to ſay neglect in the phyſicians and ſurgeons) belonging to theſe eſtabliſhments frequently prevent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy patients from receiving that conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in them that the nature of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady demands, and which was the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive object of their pious and humane foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. To correct theſe enormities is the avowed object of the preſent work, and ſucceſs in the undertaking, will be to me the moſt acceptable reward of my labour. It will ever be admitted by the advocates for humanity, that the greater the diſtreſs of the object, the greater his recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the care of philanthropy; but ſome inſtances, which I ſhall hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeem to confirm, that they maintain a contrary opinion in hoſpitals; and that the greater the diſtreſs of an object, ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief there, the greater the difficulty of removing it ſhould ſeem neceſſary.—
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0490200500:10"/>The following circumſtance (which may be depended upon as authentic) I ſhall mention, as well for its ſingular cruelty, as a confirmation of the imputation juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Curioſity led me to St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew's hoſpital on a taking-in-day, as it is termed) when a patient was admitted into the ward where I was; and after paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the extra-formalities neceſſary for ſuch admiſſion, he was introduced by one of the beadles to the ſiſter of the ward, who at firſt received him with that affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cordiality and ſeeming tenderneſs which pecuniary expectations make low minds aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; after which ſhe aſked him,—"Had he got his wardage?"—The unhappy man ſaid, "He had no money—That the laſt ſix-pence he had in the world he gave to the beadle who ſhewed him into the ward." The <hi>tender</hi> hearted ſiſter on this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flew into the moſt outrageous paſſion, and in an imperious elevation of voice, in which were blended inſolence, ignorance, and barbarity, demanded, "How he dare come there without it? Did he not know it was cuſtomary? and that it was her due or perquiſite?"—with a number of other interrogatories equally diveſted of decency, as humanity. The trembling patient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly replied, He believed it might be cuſtomary; but alledged his inability as his only reaſon for non-compliance to it. This
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0490200500:11"/>affecting confeſſion, ſo far from ſoftening the heart of the inexorable ſiſter, exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated her ſtill more, in ſo much, that ſhe abſolutely inſiſted on his turning out of the ward immediately, and actually proceeded to puſh him out: ſhock'd at ſuch unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled inhumanity, I arreſted her in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of her unfeeling purpoſe.—"Hold, monſter, ſaid I, here is your wardage, and may the gin you procure for it, rid human nature of ſo great a reproach to it!" This inveterate imprecation I could not reſtrain, in the moment of my indignant reſentment and deteſtation, for ſuch unparrallelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of ſoul!</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave the mind of ſenſibility to make its native ſympathetic comment on unfortunate wretches in the ſituation above deſcribed, and ſhall only obſerve, that ſuch inhumanity is in diametric oppoſition to the very name and nature of an hoſpital; and ſhews a lamentable degeneracy of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>This perquiſite of wardage operates va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to the diſadvantage of patients;—It makes the ſiſter look with the eye of anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety on the patient in all the progreſſive ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations and ſtages of his cure; not from a humane concern for the reſtoration of his health, but with an avaricious expectation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0490200500:12"/>of having him diſcharged, as ſhe is to get 3s. from the perſon whom accident or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe makes his ſucceſſor; and as, perhaps, ſhe has no other bed in her ward to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate ſuch caſual ſucceſſor with, but that occupied by ſome half-cured patient. It is therefore very evident, that the <hi>number of cures</hi> effected in the ward committed to her <hi>humane</hi> ſuperintendance, is not ſo much the object of her ſolicitude, as the number of patients admitted into it, as ſhe has 3s. for each. It is very reaſonable to infer, from this circumſtance that her tenderneſs will not be much exerted towards the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: the very reverſe is juſtly to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, as ſhe muſt know from experience, that moroſeneſs and brutality might induce ſome to quit the hoſpital before their cures were accompliſhed, though tenderneſs and humanity would be an additional induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to ſtay for that very deſirable purpoſe, to be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Another infamous practice of theſe wretches, to multiply their perquiſites, is to prefer complaints to the ſteward againſt the unhappy patients; for if in the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their pains they are guilty of the leaſt vehement expreſſion, they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repreſented to the ſteward as intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably noiſy and troubleſome. Thus for not having the conſtancy to maintain an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0490200500:13"/>equality of temper in the extremity of pain, they are painted out as intolerable and for no other human reaſon, than that perhaps their agonies are ſo! and a diſmiſſion ſoon after, notwithſtanding any pathetic remonſtrance to the contrary, is frequently the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>This deſpotic act of power in the <hi>Lord Steward</hi> is faithfully copied by the <hi>Lady Matron</hi> in her department, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only, that the delicacy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which females frequently labour under, will not diſpenſe with ſo immediate a diſmiſſion, but in any circumſtances where they will, her plenitude of arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority will be as ſeverely, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly exerciſed; and for the ſame iniquitous reaſon already mentioned.</p>
            <p>Is it not a melancholy conſideration, that the health, or perhaps the life, a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful member of ſociety ſhould thus fall a facrifice either to the avarice of the ſiſter, or the captice of the ſteward? and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to more than a preſumption, that this is frequently the caſe, when patients are turned out of the hoſpital before their cures are effected. The diſorder, upon the point, perhaps, of being conquered by the regimen preſcribed and followed, when the proceſs of medicinal application is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0490200500:14"/>returns to its wonted ſtrength, at a time that the body is conſiderably exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the abſtinence impoſed by regimen: when a conflict between <hi>recruited</hi> diſeaſe, and <hi>harraſſed</hi> nature enſues, which muſt neceſſarily terminate in human diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The number of evils ariſing from this pernicious perquiſite of wardage, are as obvious as they are diſtreſſing to the poor afflicted part of the community; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoped, the governors and ſubſcribers to hoſpitals will apply a radical cure to the evil, by totally ſuppreſſing it, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in its room an additional equivalent of ſalary to the ſiſters and nurſes; for, to the eternal reproach of human nature, I muſt own, that while the degraded princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or paſſion of ſelf-intereſt, ſtands in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the diſcharge of any duty, there will be found very few, eſpecially in the inferior orders of mankind, who will not make that duty ſubſervient to their intereſt, however important to ſociety the faithful diſcharge of ſuch a truſt may be! And indeed I may venture to affirm, that the ills and calamities <hi>ideally</hi> aſcribed to Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora's box, will be <hi>realized</hi> by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this, with other prohibitions on humanity, which I ſhall hereafter mention. How many are the unfortunate objects, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0490200500:15"/>from having large families, painful illneſs, or a long want of employment, are in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual want of ſubſiſtence, it is not therefore ſtrange, that under the preſſure of any, or all of theſe calamities, they ſhould want a few ſhillings; but it is very ſtrange indeed, that this want ſhould be the foundation on which the want of being cured is built, as they can not get into the hoſpital without it, as has been already ſufficiently demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? This illuſtrates and explains that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative text in the ſcripture, ſo remarkable for its obſcurity, "And from thoſe that have nothing, even that which they have will be taken from them."—It applies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the peculiarly unfortunate wretches I have been juſt deſcribing—having nothing but hope, and even that is taken away from them by this ill-timed rejection of their double claim to compaſſion.</p>
            <p>It is alſo cuſtomary (nay indeed it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary, in order to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the hoſpitals) for the patient to bring two clean ſhirts with him beſides the ſhirt he wears, which muſt be clean alſo; to the propriety, decency, and utility of this regulation, I very readily ſubſcribe, where the circumſtances of the patient will admit of a conformity to it. I admit it is alſo a co-operative aſſiſtance in the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſervation of health in the courſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0490200500:16"/>of medical application—for as filth is as obnox ous to health as to ſenſe ſo is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as uſeful to the one as agreeable to the other. But do all theſe reaſons united juſtify the cruelty of rejecting an unhappy patient for non-conformance to this hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal mandate, eſpecially when unrelenting neceſſity is the cauſe? Will any good, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be promoted by it, counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the evil promiſcuouſly entailed on every unhappy wretch thus rejected? No—I am confident it will not! Let us for a moment enter into the thoughts of the unhappy creature thus diſappointed.—All his leſs acute ſorrows, which before lay in a ſtate of torpitude, are now new-edged by this recent aggravation of his calamities! His poverty, his hapleſs helpleſs irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poverty he juſtly conſiders as the cauſe of this conſummation of human woe! his mind is alternately torn with the paſſions of grief and deſpondence, when he ſees even the probability extinguiſhed of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his health re-eſtabliſhed!</p>
            <p>Though the above is a melancholy, yet it is a true picture of the human mind bending under the complicated lead of grief, poverty, and pain.—Therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever commendable it may be, to relieve the misfortunes of our fellow creatures, it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0490200500:17"/>is much more ſo to prevent them, by the timely exertions of wiſdom and liberality in their behalf. For accompliſhing ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious a purpoſe, I would recommend it to the governors, &amp;c. to have half a dozen or a dozen of coarſe cloth ſhirts in each ward, and that the ſiſters and nurſes might be ordered to accommodate ſuch unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate patients as above deſcribed, in ſuch manner as their reſpective neceſſities ſhould demand. The object of additional expence on this occaſion would be very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but when put in competition with the bleſſings reſulting to individuals, and to ſociety at large from it, it would entirely vaniſh. This indulgence not to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any but thoſe whoſe neceſſities alone ſhould entitle them to it. How many uſeful members of ſociety, by the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this well timed benevolence, would be enabled to reſume a life of honourable induſtry, who might, through the want of this means of ſeeking to recover their health, become an incumbrance to ſociety, as would alſo their relatives, whoſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſubſiſtence was drawn from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their trade?</p>

               <p>It frequently happens, that pariſh patients are brought to Hoſpitals, to the very great prejudice of the patients who are before warded in them, as theſe pariſh patients have a diſtinction paid them very injurious to the convenience, and ſometimes to the health of thoſe other patients, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of their beds, though they ſhould be even in the extremity of a fever, to make room for the pariſh patients; and only for the pitiful conſideration of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence a day! which the pariſh allows in ſuch caſes; and which becomes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of the ſervants belonging to the hoſpitals.

               <p>With reſpect to the quality and quantity of food appointed for the uſe of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, it appears to me, in a general ſenſe, tolerably well calculated to anſwer the ends propoſed by it; but notwithſtanding, ſome alterations and additions might be made in ſome particular caſes, excluſive of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital

An abſtinence from a ſufficiency of food, in a conſtitution thus circumſtanced, lays the foundation of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſorders—as belchings, windy cholics, dizzineſs in the head, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile conſtitutions it is the undoubted fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of a conſumption—a line of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be therefore accurately drawn between thoſe who, from the nature and malignity of their complaints, can not <hi>eat ſo much</hi> as the hoſpital allowance, and thoſe who from contrary reaſons could <hi>eat more,</hi> without endangering their health, or retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cure.

               <p>Though this encreaſe of food would incur a ſmall additional expence, yet it would be a temporary one, and in its conſequences would prove a ſaving.

                  <p>Immediately antecedent to a patient's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the hoſpital, he paſſes through a very ridiculous unneceſſary formality:— He is called into a room where the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Surgeons attend, and aſked—If he has any complaint againſt the ſiſters or nurſes, &amp;c. In the name of common ſenſe I would aſk—admitting he had—Of what conſequence would it, or could it be, to ſay ſo then? What advantage would reſult to him, to tell the gentlemen, That he was not treated with the tenderneſs he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and which from the intention, as well as conſtitution of the charity, ſhould be ſhewn him? or that the peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his complaint demanded:—Of what utility could it poſſibly be to him, juſt at the moment he was to be diſcharged, to ſay, he was not tenderly or carefully nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such information now, would, like a malicious accuſation, eſpecially when it could not have for its object the redreſs of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0490200500:23"/>ſuch grievances, as to himſelf! Had theſe queſtions been propoſed to him during his reſidence in the hoſpital, for inſtance (the firſt week after his admiſſion) the fear of incurring the diſpleaſure of the gentlemen might exact that tenderneſs from the ſiſters and nurſes, which the fear of violating the obligations of humanity could no. This therefore I take to be an after-piece of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and conſequently nugatory and unavailing: for if any thing can equal its abſurdity, it is its palpable inutility.</p>
                  <p>Without intending the leaſt diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reſpectibility of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or the integrity of their principles, I would earneſtly recommend to theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen a more humane regard to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their unhappy patients. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently heard, and beheld with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gentlemen who arrived to the higheſt pitch of eminence in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, uſe exceeding harſh language and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently unfeeling treatment to their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, when in the moſt agitating mental anxiety, and under the moſt excruciating corporeal pain. This is a conduct which is by no means reconcileable to the dignity of the gentleman, the ſenſibility of the man, or the profeſſion of a ſurgeon. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this aſſumed or natural auſterity of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0490200500:24"/>manners, ſhould reflect, that there are ſome conſtitutions ſo delicately conſtructed by nature, that though they have arrived to maturity in years, are but infants in the great virtues of patience and reſignation; and conſequently require the ſame cordia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and affability in their treatment.</p>
                  <p>Another prevailing practice in an hoſpital, and which, to excite general indignation, needs only to be mentioned, is, That if a Surgeon's patient has the misfortune to have a leg or an arm dangerouſly afflicted, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is immediately propoſed, without any previous conſultation, whether a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility exiſts of effecting a cure, without having recourſe to this deſperate alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive! Surely in a matter of ſuch magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to human nature, as the mutilation or diſſolution (which frequently follows it) of one of our ſpecies, it merits the utmoſt profeſſional deliberation, before ſuch unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting reſolutions are decidedly adopted.— For, excluſive of the horrible fears that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation unavoidably excites in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's mind, preparatory to amputation, the excrutiating pain of the operation muſt be indeſcribeably great! Why then wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or incautiouſly condemn a fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſuch intolerable pains of mind and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0490200500:25"/>body, if there are any poſſible human means to avoid it!</p>
                  <p>But long experience and impartial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſuggeſt to me a conſideration, which at the ſame time that it accounts for this inhuman premature propenſity to amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reflects very little honour on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the chirurgical tribe, which is,— <hi>That experiments of this deſperate nature are made on the</hi> POOR, <hi>that they may be practiced with more probability of ſucceſs on the</hi> RICH. Though this is a harſh imputation, yet I conſcientiouſly believe it to be true in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtances; but, for the honour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, I hope there are a number of exceptions to it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I am confident to aſſert, and ready to prove, that in many inſtances, there is not that attention paid to hoſpital patients that there ought to be; for, unleſs ſome ſingular affliction attracts the attention of the gentlemen, the patients frequently lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh under <hi>common complaints</hi> with as little proſpect of redreſs <hi>in</hi> the hoſpital, as <hi>out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to the ſubſtantiating what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged above relating to amputation, I ſhall recite the following inſtance, which came under my own immediate knowledge.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0490200500:26"/>
                  <p>Some few years ago there was a patient in St. Bartholomew's Hoſpital, who labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under a violent inflammation in his left arm: a certain great profeſſional character, whoſe amputating abilities are as univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known as admired, ordered amputation immediately on the firſt ſight of the arm, without ever conſulting the patient, or giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a moment's time to enquire into his habit of body, or diſpoſition of mind, on ſo momentous an event. The man anticipated his advice from his general character, but abſolutely refuſed to comply with it, very rationally conſidering, that if a courſe of medicine was preſcribed, for the purpoſe of correcting and purifying the blood, it would probably abate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and on that event's taking place, external applications might operate more effectually. This reaſonable expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was ſoon afterwards juſtified, for in leſs than the ſhort ſpace of a month, the patient was diſcharged from the hoſpital with his arm perfectly healed! a living mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the cruelty and juſtice of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recourſe to amputation, unleſs in caſes where the unequivocal ſymptoms of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification make it indiſpenſibly neceſſary. I have every reaſon to apprehend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch cruel inattention are not few, nor the ſtill more cruel conſequences
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0490200500:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>with which they are attended; nor can the circumſtance of this unrelenting practice, not being more generally known, in the leaſt invalidate the probability of thoſe humane apprehenſions being juſt, as can be very rationally inferred from the caſe juſt mentioned.</p>

                  <p>Ingratitude, it is juſtly obſerved, is a crime of Syrian dye; but alas! it is a crime from which very few of the human race can plead an exemption; particularly to that ſupreme Being whoſe mercies to us demand our moſt animated gratitude! while in the meridian of health and proſperity we neglect thoſe great duties we <hi>ought</hi> to perform, and which, when deſcended under the clouded horizon of ſickneſs and adverſity, we <hi>cannot</hi> perform. It is in this ſtate the mind reſumes its ſalutary attribute of reflection—It is then ſhe would wiſh, by a life of prudence and penance in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0490200500:28"/>to ward off calamities which ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent intemperance or impiety make her dread for the preſent, both as to body and ſoul! When the human mind is in this ſuſceptible diſpoſition, a wiſe and humane clergyman ſhould avail himſelf of its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (as in it we are more inclined to hear and follow good advice than at any other time) by viſiting patients in ſuch ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and admoniſhing them to refrain from a repetition of thoſe irregularities, which perhaps laid the foundation of their preſent ſickneſs; and that ſuch ſickneſs was the conſequent puniſhment, of their criminal neglect of the performance of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty:" or in any other pathetic manner, that the love or duty of Chriſtianity might dictate.—For, as the ſtate of heat, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic ſubſtances, is the ſtate wherein they are made capable to aſſume new or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful forms, ſo the ſtate of affliction is the ſtate to mould the human mind to every purſuit that is congenial to the dignity of its nature. But, I am extremely ſorry to ſay, that there is very little attention paid to the diſcharge of this indiſpenſible duty in an hoſpital; more eſpecially at the time that it is moſt neceſſary, towards the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death!—For, it is truly lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſee, how ſhamefully negligent in this momentous concern, are the people
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0490200500:29"/>about an expiring wretch in an hoſpital— to whom cuſtom, joined to innate inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, has made it as indifferent to ſee a patient <hi>leaving the world,</hi> as <hi>leaving the hoſpital!</hi> This conduct is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human, but impious in the higheſt degree; as at this awful tremendous moment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding fears and infidel doubts find an eaſy conqueſt of a mind, which, though not <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> by Chriſtian philoſophy, is conſiderably <hi>weakened</hi> by diſeaſe. This, therefore, is the time to adminiſter to the <hi>exhauſted</hi> mind the lenient balſam of Chriſtianity, by infuſing into the anxious, trembling, palpitating ſoul a conviction, a hope, and a belief of its divine and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful author's protection in a future ſtate! I would not dwell ſo long on this matter, but from an internal conviction, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good morals are as often the means of <hi>preſerving</hi> health, as medicine is in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring</hi> it. A proper method of treating the <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>morals</hi> of patients ſhall be pointed out hereafter in its place; that is, immediately after ſuggeſting a plan for the removal or mitigation of all the antecedent <hi>bodily</hi> inconveniencies alluded to.</p>

                  <p>This would infallibly annihilate partial recommendation—the contaminated ſource from which various evils flow to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race—as there is no line of diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or diſtinction drawn by it, between the worthy and unworthy, often beſtowing upon ignorance and inhumanity appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to which in moral rectitude geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0490200500:32"/>us and philanthropy have the juſteſt claim. I am very well convinced from my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on human nature in the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtages of perturbation of ſpirit, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal pain, that a patient's cure is as much accelerated by the tenderneſs and humanity of the nurſe, as by the moſt obedient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the preſcriptions of the doctor; and that to effectuate a cure in the body, I hold it abſolutely neceſſary to maintain peace in the mind. It is evident from this, how eſſential it is to the health of a patient, to have an affectionate tender nurſe; and conſequently how neceſſary the precaution here recommended for the admiſſion of ſuch—as alſo the rejection of ſuch others, as do not fall under this denomination.</p>
                  <p>This committee ſhould have a power of ſuſpending any officer or ſervant already employed in the hoſpitals, on preferring and ſubſtantiating any charge of injuſtice, inattention, or inhumanity againſt them; and alſo of ſubſtituting in their room others, who, after examination, ſhould be found poſſeſſed of the qualifications already particularized.</p>
                  <p>The committee ſhould conſiſt of about eight perſons, of which number a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian and ſurgeon ſhould always make two. The neceſſity of adding profeſſional gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0490200500:33"/>will appear obvious for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons:
<list>
                        <item>Firſt. The patients under a phyſician may have a very juſt cauſe of complaint, and though the <hi>Humane Society</hi> might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to remove it, yet from a want of profeſſional knowledge, they might (through the inſinuations of the ſiſters and nurſes) be induced to believe, that ſuch treatment as the patient received, was neceſſary for the correction of his diſorder; and that it was the doctor's expreſs requiſition to purſue invariably ſuch and ſuch preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: a gentleman of the faculty being of the committee, will eaſily diſcover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the treatment ſuch patient receives is or was adapted to remove his complaints; or whether the proceſs preſcribed is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by experience, for being efficacious in removing maladies ſimilar to thoſe under which the patient labours. — If not, the report of the phyſician belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Humane Committee</hi> to the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Committee</hi> at large, would point out an abuſe, which, for want of this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional inveſtigation, would remain conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which, in my opinion, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve particular reprehenſion. And if a remonſtrance, from the <hi>Humane Committee</hi> to ſuch phyſician, did not immediately
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0490200500:34"/>produce a variation in the ſubſequent treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his patients, a report then to be made to the governors, ſubſcribers, &amp;c. at large, who, on the impartial confirmation of ſuch dangerous inattention, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a repetition of ſuch delinquency by the ſuſpenſion of its author.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, The ſurgeon, to be added to the <hi>Humane Committee,</hi> to have an equal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending controul, and unlimited pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of inſpection as the doctor, into the <hi>ſurgeons patients,</hi> their maladies and manner of treatment; and alſo any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, incapacity, or inattention in thoſe gentlemen, whoſe immediate province it ſhould be to attend this deſcription of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and to make the neceſſary report as in the caſe of the phyſician.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a matter of no conſequence to the unhappy patient, who loſes his health for want of due care, whether his misfortune is attributable to the inhumanity of the nurſe, or the inattention or ignorance of his doctor; and here I cannot avoid obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as much from theſe cauſes, as from any incurable obſtinacy of his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the patient's diſſolution happens.—Whether abuſes of this magnitude, fraught with conſequences the moſt conſpicuouſly ſubverſive of the original intention of theſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0490200500:35"/>inſtitutions, demand the interpoſition of the protecting hand of humanity, I leave it to the ſenſibility of the feeling mind to determine!</p>
                  <p>I would not be underſtood here to make the moſt diſtant inſinuation, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are many, where patients ſuffer through the <hi>ignorance</hi> of the phyſicians or ſurgeons, and even when they do it is more from negligence than any profeſſional inability; for if they will not ſedulouſly examine the patient's complaint, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly muſt be <hi>ignorant</hi> of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the moſt efficacious manner of treating it. An imputation of this ſpecies of <hi>ignorance</hi> they very frequently and very juſtly deſerve. I think inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould co-operate with duty, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting the cure of diſorders which time makes—multiply in malignity—to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable multiplication of the unhappy patient's afflictions!</p>
                  <p>Theſe affecting conſiderations ſhould be particularly attended to by the <hi>Humane Committee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the young gentlemen who walk the hoſpital for information, that levity which is almoſt the inſeparable characteriſtic of youth in any profeſſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0490200500:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>them from paying that compaſſionate attention to the preſent diſorder (which without being radically cured lays the foundation of the future calamity) of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, that they ſo preſſingly demand.—To remedy this evil, it is indiſpenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the ſenior practitioners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend by precept, and enforce by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the humane attention here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and a doubt cannot remain of ſuch conduct being circumſpectly copied: it would not only imperceptibly introduce a profeſſional, but alſo a humane emulation amongſt them, eſpecially when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that humanity gives the higheſt poliſh to their profeſſional character. I muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert with regret, that at preſent, the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the young gentlemen who walk our different hoſpitals are very little under the dominion of the humane power of ſympathy; for it is no uncommon thing to hear ſome of them (wrapt up in all the coxcombical conſequence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

To this perhaps it may be replied, that the frequency of operations and amputations familiarizes them to ſuch affecting ſights, and that there is a profeſſional neceſſity for a ſurgeon's being diveſted of the feminine weakneſs of pity, in deſperate eaſes. To the propriety of this I readily ſubſcribe, ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0490200500:37"/>far as courage is neceſſary to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe hazardous undertakings; but this admiſſion by no means implies, that <hi>inſenſibility</hi> is a neceſſary qualification in the conſtitution of a ſurgeon: the contrary, as has been already ſhewn, is the caſe. He muſt ſet out with very <hi>little</hi> humanity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who has loſt it <hi>all</hi> before he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo much knowledge in his profeſſion as will in ſome ſort apologize for the want of it. But as the conſideration of youth makes this matter as much the object of admonition as reprehenſion, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to thoſe young gentlemen to conſider, that humanity will always ſtamp a dignity on the profeſſion, which moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will rob it of; and that in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to become ſurgeons, they ſhould never forget—that they are men—and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen—appellations, to which a perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in an unfeeling conduct of this kind, will utterly exclude them from having the leaſt pretentions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Humane Committee</hi> ſhould viſit the hoſpital every week, that is, a phyſician and three other members, one week; and a ſurgeon and three other members, the next; and ſo on alternately: but if the intervention of any unexpected or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary circumſtance made it neceſſary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as each diviſion informed the other, the whole to attend.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0490200500:38"/>
                  <p>That in the courſe of theſe joint exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, they ſhould make a report to the governors or ſubſcribers, &amp;c. at their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral meetings of every thing, which in the courſe of ſuch enquiry, preſented itſelf to them as a proper object of reformation or correction, which muſt be collected prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from the ſtate and information of the patients—ſuch as inattention, ſeverity, or partiality, or any other inconvenience ariſing to the patients by omiſſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, from the ſervants, nurſes, &amp;c. either by a cenſurable neglect, or a wanton violation of the ſacred obligations of the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>It will probably be objected here, by ſome critic who has more <hi>imaginary</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than <hi>real</hi> humanity, that giving a power of ſo extenſive a latitude to <hi>one phyſician</hi> and <hi>one ſurgeon,</hi> as to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the practice and conduct of all the phyſicians and ſurgeons attending each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective hoſpital, where this regulation ſhould be eſtabliſhed, would multiply the evil it was calculated to remove, by being productive of profeſſional alteration. But this objection will be entirely obviated, when it is conſidered, that the phyſician and ſurgeon belonging to the <hi>Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> being inverted with no further au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than to ſee that the patients <hi>are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0490200500:39"/>not neglected in their reſpective profeſſional department,</hi> their office conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as a tribunal to bring characters of well eſtabliſhed abilities in their profeſſion, to the bar of examination. Their abilities are not the ſubject or object of the committee's enquiry: it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, attentive and humane exerciſe of thoſe abilities which will fall under their inveſtigation. And as the idea of their ſuperior abilities is generally and I think juſtly acquieſced in, ſo the exerciſe of them in the line of their dute ſhould be enforced. Merit, it is true, is the principal recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to any public employment whatever; but it is not the only one, for next to the indiſpenſible neceſſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any public profeſſional duty is that of ſaithfully performing it. But care ſhould be always taken in accurately drawing a line of diſtinction between <hi>accidental</hi> and <hi>intentional</hi> guilt. That is, acting contrary to the ſpirit of the inſtitution from <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or from <hi>a depravity of ſentiment.</hi> It will in ſuch caſes be in the diſcretion of the Committee to proportion the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the crime.</p>
                  <p>This committee ſhould be perpetual, as well to prevent future, as to correct preſent abuſes. It ſhould be choſen annually, or quarterly, &amp;c. as the wiſdom of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0490200500:40"/>ſhould point out, or as the neceſſity of the patients might demand. A ſalary to be appointed to the uſe of the phyſician and ſurgeon, bearing proper proportion to their merit, and the fidelity with which they would be found to diſcharge the humane appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhould be now called to.</p>
                  <p>Wiſdom and experience have found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in diſcharging the great commercial conſtitutional duties of the ſtate, to inſtitute reciprocal checques in the different departments of it—and to this inſtitution is principally owing the fidelity with which theſe important truſts are diſcharged. The rule will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately apply to the diſcharge of the offices of humanity in hoſpitals,—and ſurely the one is not leſs important than the other—conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently demands an equal vigilance in its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
                  <p>I would have the <hi>Humane Committee</hi> ſee that the clergyman ſhould viſit the hoſpital every day—preparing thoſe that are <hi>likely to die,</hi> for ſo tremendous a change, and admoniſhing thoſe that are <hi>likely to live,</hi> to purſue the paths of virtue, as the moſt likely means of preſerving future health, and procuring hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—for it is an indelible reproach to Chriſtianity, the general neglect of this great—this important conſideration at preſent. And as divines in general are not remarkable for doing <hi>more</hi> than their duty, I would ſee that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0490200500:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the preſent caſe they ſhould not do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>Obſervations to enforce the foregoing Motives of Reform.</head>
                  <p>Though the internal regulations of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals may vary in particulars, yet their general object is the ſame. They are all appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome benevolent purpoſe or other—for the relief of human miſery, in whatever vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſhapes it may aſſume, and to comfort the comfortleſs. As this is a fact univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known, what I write reſpecting <hi>one</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to <hi>all.</hi> I therefore moſt pathetically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a general enquiry to be made into the abuſes here complained of—and ſincerely wiſh, that a general reformation may be the conſequence. There cannot be a more ample field for the exerciſe of general benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than ſuch an inveſtigation—and if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon with the ſpirit of unanimity, muſt reſcue the national character from the illiberal, though unjuſt imputation of foreigners, on the intolerable abuſe of our public charities, who ſay, "That there are very few monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our humanity here beſides ſtone!"</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0490200500:42"/>
                  <p>I have chalked out the foregoing line for accompliſhing this much-to be-wiſhed-for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, without being the leaſt tenacious, whether the plan I have delineated will be <hi>literally</hi> purſued or not. To the ſuperior wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the governors, &amp;c. I implicitly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my humble efforts, in recommending a better regulation in our hoſpitals than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent characterizes them, and if the <hi>moae</hi> I have ſuggeſted does not meet their approbation, as to <hi>manner,</hi> I have the pleaſure to anticipate it will be adopted as to <hi>matter.</hi> It is indifferent to me <hi>what means are purſued ſo the end is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi> An effectual reformation of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes here alluded to, was my motive in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my pen, and I have a ſecret pleaſure in hoping, that the co-operation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, &amp;c. will bring, to a benevolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, what I had the good fortune to begin, not doubting, but their humanity will adopt the hint, and their wiſdom point out the moſt effectual means of carrying it into execution.</p>
                  <p>The French nation (though diſtinguiſhed for peculiar levity and national volatility) are by no means diveſted of the exalted feelings of humanity. Their hoſpitals are many, and under excellent regulations, particularly ſince a reformation of the nature here recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed has taken place there, which brought to light a number of enormities that otherwiſe would have lain covered in the oblivion of venality. But there is not ſo extenſive a field
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0490200500:43"/>for abuſe in their charities as in ours—as in point of wealth our hoſpitals have a decided ſuperiority—and this advantage, which could be converted to the additional accommodation of theſe receptacles of affliction, is one of the ſources from whence the majority of the evils here complained of flow—for, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wealth will ever give birth to peculation, and peculation to infidelity, in the diſcharge of lucrative truſts.—</p>
                  <p>As it muſt be admitted, that we frequently copy the faſhionable abſurdities of our Gallic neighbours, let us convince <hi>them</hi> and <hi>the world,</hi> that we are alſo capable of imitating their virtues, by adopting a plan ſimilar to that they have purſued, for correcting the flagrant abuſes committed in the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of our public charities: a work, which whoever ſets on foot, that will redound no leſs to <hi>their</hi> immortal honour, than the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe hoſpitals do to their godlike founders, and will, in conjunction with ſuch dignified names, hand <hi>theirs</hi> down to the lateſt poſterity, with the veneration and reſpect, that diſintereſtedneſs and humanity will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from a ſenſible and generous people.</p>
                  <p>Humanity is the moſt diſtinguiſhing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of human perfection—any man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of it, ſhould be diveſted of all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial privileges of a <hi>rational</hi> being. It is in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0490200500:44"/>man, what mercy is in the gracious author of our exiſtence! and the greateſt poſſible degree of excellence our nature (conſidering its inſeparable imperfections) is capable of arriving at, is to be humane—It comprehends every ſocial obligation that unites man to man. Religion is but a name, and man a two leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged monſter without it. As humanity is therefore the unadulterated religion of nature, I would wiſh to impreſs this conſequential truth on the minds of mankind; THAT AN EXTERNAL CONFORMITY TO GOSPEL IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JUNCTIONS, CAN NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE TO GOD, UNACCOMPANIED BY INTERNAL MOTIVES OF HUMANITY, AND THE AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUAL DISCHARGE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS.</p>
                  <p>The love of God is religion; the love of man, humanity. So that it is evident it is no leſs a Chriſtian duty, <hi>"To love God above all things, than our neighbours as ourſelves."</hi>— The latter duty, left unperformed, makes the pretentions to the former as abſurd as impious. How neceſſary therefore to recommend and enforce this ſecondary obligation of mankind! eſpecially as our own happineſs is ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately connected with the diſcharge of this benevolent duty—as we have the moſt une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal aſſurance, from the divine author of our redemption, that if we act with huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity towards our diſtreſſed brethren, he will act with mercy towards us; that is, if we ſhew benevolence, we ſhall find mercy. This
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0490200500:45"/>is a conſideration of the greateſt magnitude that can poſſibly attract the attention. or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the rational faculties of man! and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the moſt uſeful to be preached and practiced. This is the religion which every man ſhould <hi>openly profeſs</hi> and <hi>inwardly believe;</hi> and in which no man need be aſhamed to live or afraid to die! Humanity with any ſyſtem of Chiſtian religion muſt be acceptable to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; any without it, an abomination!</p>
                  <p>I hope therefore the united motives of Chriſtianity and humanity will animate every generous ſpark of benevolence in the mind of the governors, &amp;c. (in which thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues appeared to be ſuſpended by ſuffering with impunity the abuſes and neglects here complained of), and that they will accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly take ſuch neceſſary ſteps as will guard thoſe benevolent inſtitutions from abuſe, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or degeneracy. What a heart-felt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation it muſt be to them, in every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ſtage of life, to reflect, that at one and the ſame time, they have diſcharged the ſacred duties of Chriſtianity, and complied with the natural dictates of humanity! but, on the contrary, how agonizing would it be to their exalted ſenſibility, to apprehend that thoſe pious and humane intentions ſhould be counteracted by the depravity of the perſons entruſted with the execution of them. The native benevolence of his own mind, prevents a good man from even ſuſpecting that ſuch
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0490200500:46"/>depraved characters as are here deſcribed, have an exiſtence—his own innate goodneſs being the ſtandard by which he charitably, tho' erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, eſtimates the characters of others by: but though this unſuſpicious good-nature is the moſt infallible characteriſtic of a generous mind; yet it by no means implies a neceſſary knowledge of mankind, for it is well known, that both in principle and practice, no two diſtinct things, ſtand in more diametric op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to one another, than man and man. It is therefore but half of a good man's duty to <hi>act well himſelf;</hi> the other half conſiſts in making <hi>thoſe</hi> under his immediate controul <hi>act well alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a matter of ſuch importance to ſociety at large, as the reſtoration of the health of perhaps ſome thouſands, ſo as to be enabled to reſume lives of independent induſtry, too much care cannot be taken, to ſee that the operations for ſo ſalutary a purpoſe are not retarded by the intervention of any ſiniſter or intereſted motives, or even by the neglect of thoſe, whoſe immediate province it is to ſee theſe benevolent purpoſes carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Humanity is capable of degenerating into a criminal forgiveneſs in good-natured minds. From this miſguided notion of its principle, good-natured men frequently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give through compaſſion, what they ought to puniſh through juſtice. This error they are inſenſibly led into by endeavouring to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0490200500:47"/>the oppoſite character of ſeverity. But, it ſhould be engraved with an damantine pencil, on tablets of the moſt laſting temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſteel, as a maxim for the regulation of the conduct of mankind—<hi>That there ſhould always be a</hi> WREATH <hi>for the</hi> ADVOCATES, <hi>and a</hi> ROD <hi>for the</hi> ENEMIES <hi>of Humanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall make no apology for the above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, from a conviction, that my humane readers will coincide with me in the opinion, that any deviation from the immediate ſubject which is calculated to enforce the abſolute neceſſity that exiſts of a reformation in our Hoſpitals (and alſo the general good likely to ariſe from it) cannot be conſidered as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting or unimportant.</p>
                  <p>Should the adoption of the foregoing hints of reformation be thought likely to conduce to the obtaining the ends propoſed, <hi>The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Committee</hi> would, in the exerciſe of their new-inveſted authority, inavoidably be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with numberleſs objects of <hi>correction</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi> at the ſame time.
