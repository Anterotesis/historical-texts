            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it requires no <hi>valet de place</hi> to conduct you through the purlieus of faſhion, for now the way of the world is, for every one to purſue their own way, and following the faſhion is differing as much as poſſible from the reſt of your acquaintance.</p>

                     <p>When I left my native country, I leſt it with a heart lacerated by every wound that the falſehood of others or my own conſcience could inflict. Hateful to myſelf, I became the victim of diſſipation—I ruſhed to the gaming table, and ſoon became the dupe of villains.—My ample fortune
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1135500100:50"/>was loſt; I detected one in the act of ſraud, and having brought him to my feet, he confeſſed a plan had been laid for my ruin; that he was but an humble inſtrument; for that the man who, by his ſuperior genius, ſtood poſſeffed of all the mortgages and ſecurities I had given, was one Mortington.</p>

                     <speaker>Miſs B.</speaker>
                     <p>I have heard your name him before. Did you not know this Morrington?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Philip.</speaker>
                     <p>No; he, like his deeds, avoided the light—Ever dark, ſubtle, and myſterious. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the ſcattered remnant of my fortune, I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered wretched and deſolare, till, in a peaceful village, I firſt beheld thy mother, humble in birth, but exalted in virtue. The morning after our marriage ſhe received a packet, containing theſe words: <q>The reward of virtuous love, preſented by a repentant villain;</q> and which alſo contained bills and notes to the high amount of ten thouſand pounds.</p>

                     <p>None; nor could I ever gueſs at the generous donor. I need not tell thee what my heart ſuffered when death deprived me of her. Thus circumſtanced, this good man, Sir Abel Handy, propoſed to unite our families by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and in conſideration of what he termed the honor of our alliance, agreed to pay off every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance on my eſtates, and ſettle them as a portion on you and his ſon. Yet ſtill another wonder remains.—When I arrive, I find no claim whatever has been made, either by Morrington or his agents. What am I to think? Can Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington have periſhed, and with him his large claims to my property? Or, does he withhold the blow, to make it fall more heavily?</p>

But 'tis hard for the heart to forego, without one ſtruggle, its only hope of happineſs; and conſcious of my own honor, what have I to fear? Perhaps he may repent his unkindneſs to me—at leaſt I'll put his paſſion to the proof; if he be worthy of my love, happineſs is for ever mine; if not, I'll tear him from my breaſt, tho' from the wound my life's blood ſhould follow.
