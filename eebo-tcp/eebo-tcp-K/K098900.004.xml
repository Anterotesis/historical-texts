            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN I firſt reſolved upon doing my ſelf this Honour, I could not but indulge a certain Vanity in dating from this little Covert, where I have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the Honour of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Company, and received from you very many Obligations. The elegant Solitude of this Place, and
<pb facs="tcp:0397200204:4"/>
the greateſt Pleaſures of it I owe to its being ſo near thoſe Beautiful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors wherein you ſometimes reſide: It is not retiring from the World, but enjoying its moſt valuable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, when a Man is permitted to ſhare in your Lordſhip's Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Country. All the bright Images which the Wits of paſt Ages have left behind them in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the noble Plans which the greateſt Stateſmen have laid down for Adminiſtration of Affairs, are equally the familiar Objects of your Knowledge. But what is peculiar to your Lordſhip above all the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Perſonages that have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any Age, is, that Wit and Learning have from your Example fallen into a new <hi>Aera.</hi> Your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage has produced thoſe Arts, which before ſhunned the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the World, into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Life; and it is to you we owe, that the Man of Wit has turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be a Man of Buſineſs. The falſe Delicacy of Men of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
<pb facs="tcp:0397200204:5"/>
and the Objections which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were apt to inſinuate againſt their Abilities for entring into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, have equally vaniſhed. And Experience has ſhown, that Men of Letters are not only qualify'd with a greater Capacity, but alſo a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Integrity in the Diſpatch of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Your own Studies have been diverted from being the higheſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, to the higheſt Uſe to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the Capacities which would have rendered you the greateſt Poet of your Age, have to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Great Britain</hi> been employ'd in Purſuits which have made you the moſt able and unbiaſſed Patriot. A vigorous Imagination, an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Apprehenſion, and a ready Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have diſtinguiſhed you in all the illuſtrious Parts of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a Reign attended with ſuch Difficulties, that the ſame Talents without the ſame Quickneſs in the Poſſeſſion of them would have been incapable of Conquering.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the laſt <hi>Tatler</hi> I promiſed ſome Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Paſſages and Perſons mention'd in this Work, as well as ſome Account of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have had in the Performance. I ſhall do this in very few Words; for when a Man has no Deſign but to ſpeak plain Truth, he may ſay a great deal in a very narrow Compaſs. I have in the Dedication of the Firſt Volume made my Acknowledgments to Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Writings, in the Name of <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Inclination in the Town towards any Thing that could appear in the ſame Diſguiſe. I muſt acknowledge alſo, that at my firſt entring upon this Work, a certain uncommon Way of Thinking, and a Turn in Converſation peculiar to that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gentleman, rendered his Company very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to one whoſe Imagination was to be continually employed upon obvious and common Subjects, though at the ſame Time obliged to treat of them in a new and unbeaten Method. His Verſes on the <hi>Shower in Town,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Morning,</hi> are Inſtances of the Happineſs of that Genius, which could raiſe ſuch Pleaſing Idea's upon Occaſions ſo barren to an ordinary Invention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0397200204:8"/>
When I am upon the Houſe of <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> I muſt not forget that Genealogy of the Family ſent to me by the Poſt, and written, as I ſince under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, by Mr. <hi>Twiſden,</hi> who died at the Battle of <hi>Mons,</hi> and has a Monument in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey</hi> ſuitable to the Reſpect which is due to his Wit and his Valour. There are through the Courſe of the Work very many Incidents which were written by unknown Correſpondents. Of this Kind is the Tale in the Second <hi>Tatler,</hi> and the Epiſtle from Mr. <hi>Downes</hi> the Prompter, with others which were very well received by the Publick. But I have only one Gentleman, who will be nameleſs, to thank for any frequent Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to me, which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he has lived in an Intimacy from Childhood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great Eaſe with which he is able to diſpatch the moſt entertaining Pieces of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This good Office he performed with ſuch Force of Genius, Humour, Wit and Learning, that I fared like a diſtreſſed Prince who calls in a powerful Neighbour to his Aid; I was undone by my Auxiliary; when I had once called him in, I could not ſubſiſt without Dependance on him.</p>
            <p>The ſame Hand writ the diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Men and Women under the Names of <hi>Muſical Inſtruments, the Diſtreſs of the News-Writers, the Inventory of the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> and <hi>the Deſcription of the Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,</hi> which I cannot but look upon as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Embelliſhments of this Work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0397200204:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus for I thought neceſſary to ſay relating to the great Hands which have been concerned in theſe Volumes, with Relation to the Spirit and Genius of the Work; and am far from pretending to Modeſty in making this Acknowledgment. What a Man obtains from the good Opinion and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of worthy Men, is a much greater Honour than he can poſſibly reap from any Accompliſhments of his own. But all the Credit of Wit which was given me by the Gentlemen above-mentioned (with whom I have now accounted) has not been able to attone for the Exceptions made againſt me for ſome Raillery in Behalf of that learned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the Epiſcopacy of the Church, and the Liberty of the People, Mr. <hi>Hoadley.</hi> I mention this only to defend my ſelf againſt the Imputation of being moved rather by Party than Opinion; and I think it is apparent, I have with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Frankneſs allowed Merit wherever I found it, though joined in Intereſts different from thoſe for which I have declared my ſelf. When my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonius</hi> is acknowledged to be Dr. <hi>Smalridge,</hi> and the amiable Character of the Dean in the Sixty ſixth <hi>Tatler</hi> drawn for Dr. <hi>Atterbury,</hi> I hope I need ſay no more as to my Impartiality.</p>
            <p>I really have acted in theſe Caſes with Honeſty, and am concerned it ſhould be thought otherwiſe: For Wit, if a Man had it, unleſs it be directed to ſome uſeful End, is but a wanton frivolous Quality; all that one ſhould value himſelf upon in this Kind is, that he had ſome honourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0397200204:10"/>
As for this Point, never Hero in Romance was carried away with a more furious Ambition to conquer Giants and Tyrants, than I have been in extirpating Gameſters and Duelliſts And indeed, like one of thoſe Knights too, though I was calm before, I am apt to fly out again, when the Thing that firſt diſturbed me is preſented to my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. I ſhall therefore leave off when I am well, and fight with Windmills no more: Only ſhall be ſo Arrogant as to ſay of my ſelf, that in Spite of all the Force of Faſhion and Prejudice, in the Face of all the World, I alone bewailed the Condition of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, whoſe Fortune and Life are at this Day precarious; while His Eſtate is liable to the Demands of Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, through a falſe Senſe of Juſtice; and to the Demands of Duelliſts, through a falſe Senſe of Honour. As to the Firſt of theſe Orders of Men, I have not one Word more to ſay of them: As to the latter, I ſhall conclude all I have more to offer aginſt them (with Reſpect to their being prompted by the Fear of Shame) by applying to the Duelliſt what I think Dr. <hi>South</hi> ſays ſomewhere of the Lyar, <hi>He is a Coward to Man, and a Brave to God.</hi>

I have hinted heretofore ſome Things which diſcover the real Sorrow I am in at the Obſervation, that it is now very much ſo in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and have had the Honour to be pelted with ſeveral Epiſtles to expoſtulate with me on that Subject. Among others, one from a Perſon of the Number of thoſe they call <hi>Quakers,</hi> who ſeems to admoniſh me out of pure Zeal and Good-will.

contrary Side, ſo there is no Part we can act ſo juſtifiable as to ſpeak our Mind when we ſee Things urged to Extremity, againſt all that is Praiſe-worthy or valuable in Life, upon general and groundleſs Suggeſtions. But if I have talked too frankly upon ſuch Reflections, my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent has laid before me, after his Way, the Error of it in a Manner that makes me indeed thankful for his Kindneſs, but the more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to repeat the Imprudence from the Neceſſity of the Circumſtance.</p>

Thou didſt thy ſelf indite the Epiſtle inſerted in one of thy late Lucubrations, as thou wouldſt have us call them: For verily thy Friend of Stone, and I ſpeak according to Knowledge, hath no Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and tho' he hath a Mouth, yet ſpeaketh he not therewith; nor yet did that Epiſtle at all come unto thee from the Manſion-houſe of the Scarlet Whore. It is plain therefore, that the Truth is not in thee: But ſince thou wouldſt lye, couldſt thou not lye with more Diſcretion? Wherefore ſhouldſt thou inſult over the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or add Sorrow unto the Heavy of Heart? Truly this Gall proceedeth not from the Spirit of Meekneſs. I tell thee moreover, the People of this Land be marvelouſly given to Change; inſomuch that it may lightly come to paſs, that before thou art many Years nearer to thy Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, thou mayſt behold him ſitting on a high Place whom thou now laugheſt to Scorn: And then how wilt thou be glad to humble thy ſelf to the Ground, and lick the Duſt of his Feet, that thou mayſt find Favour in his Sight? If thou didſt meditate as much upon the Word as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0397200204:13"/>
thou doſt upon the prophane Scribblings of the wiſe Ones of this Generation, thou wouldſt have remembred what happened unto <hi>Shimei,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gera</hi> the <hi>Benjamite,</hi> who curſed the good Man <hi>David</hi> in his Diſtreſs. <hi>David</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his Tranſgreſſion, yet was he afterwards taken as in a Snare by the Words of his own Mouth, and fell by the Sword of <hi>Solomon</hi> the chief Ruler. Furthermore, I do not remember to have heard in the Days of my Youth and Vanity, when, like thine, my Converſation was with the Gentiles, that the Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is <hi>Babylon,</hi> ever ſued unto the Men of <hi>Carthage</hi> for Tranquility, as thou doſt aver: Neither was <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> called Home by his Countrymen, till theſe ſaw the Sword of their Enemies at their Gates; And then was it not Time for him, thinkeſt thou, to return? It appeareth therefore that thou doſt propheſy backwards, thou doſt row one Way, and look another; and indeed in all Things art thou too much a Time-ſerver; yet ſeemeſt thou not to conſider what a Day may bring forth. Think of this, and take Tobacco.</p>

               <p>OF all the Evils under the Sun, that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Vice commendable is the greateſt: For it ſeems to be the Baſis of Society, that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and Contempt ſhould be always given to proper Objects. But in this Age we behold Things for which we ought to have an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not only received without Diſdain, but even valued as Motives of Emulation. This is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the Deſtruction of Simplicity of Manners, Openneſs of Heart, and Generoſity of Temper. When one gives ones ſelf the Liberty to range, and run over in ones Thoughts the different Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's of Men which one meets in the World, one cannot but obſerve, that moſt of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Artifice which is uſed among Men, does not proceed ſo much from a Degeneracy in Nature, as an Affectation of appearing Men of Conſequence by ſuch Practices. By this Means it is, that a cunning Man is ſo far from being aſhamed of being eſteemed ſuch, that he ſecretly rejoices in it. It has been a Sort of Maxim, That the greateſt Art is to conceal Art; but I know not how, among ſome People we meet with, their greateſt Cunning is to appear cunning. There is <hi>Polypragmon</hi> makes it the whole Buſineſs of his Life to be thought a cunning Fellow, and thinks it a much greater Character to be terrible than agreeable. When it has once enter'd into a Man's Head to have an Ambition to be thought crafty, all other Evils are neceſſary Conſequences. To
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0397200204:17"/>
deceive, is the immediate Endeavour of him who is proud of the Capacity of doing it. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Polypragmon</hi> does all the Ill he poſſibly can, but pretends to much more than he performs. He is contented in his own Thoughts, and hugs himſelf in his Cloſet, that though he is locked up there and doing nothing, the World does not know but that he is doing Miſchief. To favour this Suſpicion, he gives Half-Looks and Shrugs in his general Behaviour, to give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that you don't know what he means. He is alſo wonderfully adverbial in his Expreſſions, and breaks off with a Perhaps and a Nod of the Head, upon Matters of the moſt indifferent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is a mighty Practice with Men of this Genius to avoid frequent Appearance in Publick, and to be as myſterious as poſſible when they do come into Company. There is nothing to be done, according to them, the common Way; and let the Matter in Hand be what it will, it muſt be carried with an Air of Importance, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, if we may ſo ſpeak, with an oſtentatious Secrecy. Theſe are your Perſons of long Heads, who would fain make the World believe their Thoughts and Idea's are very much ſuperior to their Neighbours, and do not value what theſe their Neighbours think of them, provided they do not reckon them Fools. Theſe have ſuch a Romantick Touch in Buſineſs, that they hate to perform any Thing like other Men. Were it in their Choice, they had rather bring their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to bear by over-reaching the Perſons they deal with, than by a plain and ſimple Manner. They make Difficulties for the Honour of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting them. <hi>Polypragmon</hi> is eternally buſied after this Manner, with no other Proſpect than that he is in Hopes to be thought the moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all Men, and fears the Imputation of Want of Underſtanding much more than that of the Abuſe of it. But alas! How contemptible is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0397200204:18"/>
ſuch an Ambition, which is the very Reverſe of all that is truly laudable; and the very Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the only Means to a juſt Reputation, Simplicity of Manners? Cunning can in no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance imaginable be a Quality worthy a Man, except in his own Defence, and meerly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf from ſuch as are ſo; and in ſuch Caſes it is no longer Craft, but Wiſdom. The monſtrous Affectation of being thought artful, immediately kills all Thoughts of Humanity and Goodneſs, and gives Men a Senſe of the ſoft Affections and Impulſes of the Mind (which are imprinted in us for our mutual Advantage and Succour) as of meer Weakneſſes and Follies. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Men of Cunning, you are to put off the Nature of a Man as faſt as you can, and acquire that of a Daemon, as if it were a more eligible Character to be a powerful Enemy, than an able Friend. But it ought to be a Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Men affected this Way, that there wants but little more than Inſtinct to be conſiderable in it; for when a Man has arrived at being very bad in his Inclination, he has not much more to do, but to conceal himſelf, and he may revenge, cheat, and deceive, without much Employment for Underſtanding, and go on with great Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs with the high Applauſe of being a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious cunning Fellow. But indeed, when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that Pitch of falſe Taſte, as not to think Cunning a contemptible Quality, it is, methinks, a very great Injuſtice that Pickpockets are had in ſo little Veneration, who muſt be admirably well turned, not only for the Theoretick, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Practical Behaviour of cunning Fellows. After all the Endeavour of this Family of Men, whom we call cunning, their whole Work falls to Pieces, if others will lay down all Eſteem for ſuch Artifices, and treat it as an unmanly Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they forbear to practiſe only becauſe they abhor it. When the Spider is ranging in

               <p>Tho' the Taſte of Wit and Pleaſure is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but very low in this Town, yet there are ſome that preſerve their Reliſh undebauched with common Impreſſions, and can diſtinguiſh between Reality and Impoſture. A Gentleman was ſaying here this Evening, That he would go to the Play to Morrow Night to ſee Heroiſm, as it has been repreſented by ſome of our Tragedians, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Burleſque. It ſeems, the Play of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> is to be then turned into Ridicule for its Bombaſt, and other falſe Ornaments in the Thought as well as the Language. The Bluſter <hi>Alexander</hi> makes, is as much inconſiſtent with the Character of an Hero, as the Roughneſs of <hi>Clytus</hi> an Inſtance of the Sincerity of a bold art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Soldier. To be plain is not to be rude, but rather inclines a Man to Civility and Deference; not indeed to ſhow it in the Geſtures of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but in the Sentiments of the Mind. It is among other Things from the impertinent Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures unskilful Dramatiſts draw of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Men, that Youth are bewildered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in their Senſe of the World, of which they have no Notions but what they draw from Books and ſuch Repreſentations. Thus talk to a very young Man, let him be of never ſo good Senſe, and he ſhall ſmile when you ſpeak of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in a Courtier, good Senſe in a Soldier, or Honeſty in a Politician. The Reaſon of this is, That you hardly ſee one Play wherein each of theſe Ways of Life is not drawn by Hands that know nothing of any one of them: And the Truth is ſo far of the oppoſite Side to what they paint, that it is more impracticable to live in Eſteem in Courts than any where elſe without Sincerity. Good
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0397200204:20"/>
Senſe is the great Requiſite in a Soldier, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty the only Thing that can ſupport a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. This Way of Thinking made the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of whom I was juſt now ſpeaking ſay, He was glad any one had taken upon him to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate ſuch unnatural Fuſtian as the Tragedy of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The Character of that Prince indeed was, That he was unequal, and given to Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; but in his ſober Moments, when he had warm in his Imagination the Precepts of his great Inſtructor, he was a Pattern of generous Thoughts and Diſpoſitions, in Oppoſition to the ſtrongeſt Deſires which are incident to a Youth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. But inſtead of repreſenting that Hero in the glorious Character of Generoſity and Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in his Treatment of the beauteous Family of <hi>Darius,</hi> he is drawn all along as a Monſter of Luſt, or of Cruelty; as if the Way to raiſe him to the Degree of an Hero, were to make his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as little like that of a worthy Man as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Such rude and indigeſted Draughts of Things are the proper Objects of Ridicule and Contempt, and depreciating <hi>Alexander,</hi> as we have him drawn, is the only Way of reſtoring him to what he was in himſelf. It is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived of the Players to let this Part be followed by a true Picture of Life, in the Comedy call'd, <hi>The Chances,</hi> wherein Don <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Conſtantia</hi> are acted to the utmoſt Perfection. There need not be a greater Inſtance of the Force of Action than in many Incidents of this Play, where indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Paſſages, and ſuch that conduce only to the tacking of the Scenes together, are enlivened with ſuch an agreeable Geſture and Behaviour, as apparently ſhows what a Play might be, tho' it is not wholly what a Play ſhould be.</p>

               <p>SOme Years ſince I was engaged with a Coach full of Friends to take a Journey as far as the <hi>Land's-End.</hi> We were very well pleaſed with one another the firſt Day, every one endeavouring to recommend himſelf by his good Humour and Complaiſance to the reſt of the Company. This good Correſpondence did not laſt long; one of our Party was ſowred the very firſt Evening by a Plate of Butter which had not been melted to his Mind, and which ſpoiled his Temper to ſuch a Degree, that he continued upon the Fret to the End of our Journey. A Second fell off from his good Humour the next Morning, for no other Reaſon that I could imagine, but becauſe I chanced to ſtep into the Coach before him, and place my ſelf on the ſhady Side. This however was but my own private Gueſs, for he did not mention a Word of it, nor indeed of any Thing elſe, for Three Days following. The reſt of our Company held out very near half the Way, when of a ſudden Mr. <hi>Sprightly</hi> fell aſleep; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of endeavouring to divert and oblige us, as he had hitherto done, carried himſelf with an unconcerned, careleſs, drowzy Behaviour, till we came to uur laſt Stage. There were Three of us who ſtill held up our Heads, and did all we could to make our Journey agreeable; but, to my Shame be it ſpoken, about Three Miles on this Side <hi>Exeter,</hi> I was taken with an unaccountable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0397200204:22"/>
Fit of Sullenneſs, that hung upon me for above Threeſcore Miles; whether it were for Want of Reſpect, or from an accidental. Tread upon my Foot, or from a fooliſh Maid's calling me <hi>The old Gentleman.</hi> I cannot tell. In ſhort, there was but one who kept his good Humour to the <hi>Land's-End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was another Coach that went along with us, in which I likewiſe obſerved, that there were many ſecret Jealouſies, Heart-burnings, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities: For when we joined Companies at Night, I could not but take Notice, that the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers neglected their own Company, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died how to make themſelves eſteemed by us, who were altogether Strangers to them; till at length they grew ſo well acquainted with us, that they liked us as little as they did one another. When I reflect upon this Journey, I often fancy it to be a Picture of Humane Life, in Reſpect to the ſeveral Friendſhips, Contracts, and Alliances, that are made and diſſolved in the ſeveral Periods of it. The moſt delightful and moſt laſting En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements are generally thoſe which paſs between Man and Woman; and yet upon what Trifles are they weakened, or entirely broken? Sometimes the Parties fly aſunder, even in the Midſt of Courtſhip, and ſometimes grow cool in the very Honey Month. Some ſeparate before the Firſt Child, and ſome after the Fifth; others continue good till Thirty, others till Forty; while ſome few, whoſe Souls are of an happier Make, and better fitted to one another, travel on toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the End of their Journey in a continual Intercourſe of kind Offices and mutual Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>When we therefore chuſe our Companions for Life, if we hope to keep both them and our ſelves in good Humour to the laſt Stage of it, we muſt be extreamly careful in the Choice we make, as well as in the Conduct on our own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0397200204:23"/>
Part. When the Perſons to whom we join our ſelves can ſtand an Examination, and bear the Scrutiny, when they mend upon our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, and diſcover new Beauties the more we ſearch into their Characters, our Love will naturally riſe in Proportion to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there are very few poſſeſſed of ſuch Accompliſhments of Body and Mind, we ought to look after thoſe Qualifications both in our ſelves and others, which are indiſpenſibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards this happy Union, and which are in the Power of every one to acquire, or at leaſt to cultivate and improve. Theſe, in my Opinion, are Chearfulneſs and Conſtancy. A chearful Temper joined with Innocence, will make Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty attractive, Knowledge delightful, and Wit good-natured. It will lighten Sickneſs, Poverty, and Affliction; convert Ignorance into an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Simplicity, and render Deformity it ſelf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Conſtancy is natural to Perſons of even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and uniform Diſpoſitions, and may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by thoſe of the greateſt Fickleneſs, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Paſſion, who conſider ſeriouſly the Terms of Union upon which they come together, the mutual Intereſt in which they are engaged, with all the Motives that ought to incite their Tenderneſs and Compaſſion towards thoſe who have their Dependance upon them, and are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked with them for Life in the ſame State of Happineſs or Miſery. Conſtancy, when it grows in the Mind upon Conſiderations of this Nature, becomes a Moral Virtue, and a kind of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is not ſubject to any Change of Health, Age, Fortune, or any of thoſe Accidents which are apt to unſettle the beſt Diſpoſitions that are founded rather in Conſtitution than in Reaſon. Where ſuch a Conſtancy as this is wanting, the moſt enflamed Paſſion may fall away into Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0397200204:24"/>
and Indifference, and the moſt melting Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs degenerate into Hatred and Averſion. I ſhall conclude this Paper with a Story that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known in the North of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Thirty Years ago, a Packet-Boat that had ſeveral Paſſengers on Board was caſt away upon a Rock, and in ſo great Danger of ſinking, that all who were in it endeavoured to ſave themſelves as well at they could, though only thoſe who could ſwim well had a bare Poſſibility of doing it. Among the Paſſengers there were Two Women of Faſhion, who ſeeing themſelves in ſuch a diſconſolate Condition, begged of their Husbands not to leave them. One of them choſe rather to die with his Wife, than to forſake her; the other, though he was moved with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Compaſſion for his Wife, told her, That for the Good of their Children it was better one of them ſhould live, than both periſh. By a great Piece of good Luck, next to a Miracle, when one of our good Men had taken the laſt and long Farewel in order to ſave himſelf, and the other held in his Arms the Perſon that was dearer to him than Life, the Ship was preſerved. It is with a ſecret Sorrow and Vexation of Mind that I muſt tell the Sequel of the Story, and let my Reader know, that this faithful Pair who were ready to have died in each others Arms, about Three Years after their Eſcape, upon ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Diſguſt, grew to a Coldneſs at firſt, and at length fell out to ſuch a Degree, that they left one another, and parted for ever. The other Couple lived together in an uninterrupted Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Felicity; and what was remarkable, the Husband whom the Shipwreck had like to have ſeparated from his Wife, died a few Months after her, not being able to ſurvive the Loſs of her.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, there is ſomething in the Changeableneſs and Inconſtancy of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that very often both dejects and terrifies
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0397200204:25"/>
me. Whatever I am at preſent, I tremble to think what I may be. While I find this Principle in me, How can I aſſure my ſelf that I ſhall be always true to my God, my Friend, or my ſelf? In ſhort, without Conſtancy there is neither Love, Friendſhip, or Virtue, in the World.</p>

               <p>I Have of late received many Epiſtles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Writers treat me as a mercenary Perſon for ſome late Hints concerning Matters which they think I ſhould not have touched upon but for ſordid Conſiderations. It is apparent, that my Motive could not be of that Kind; for when a Man declares him ſelf openly on one Side, that Party will take no more Notice of him, becauſe he is ſure; and the Set of Men whom he declares againſt, for the ſame Reaſon are violent againſt him. Thus it is Folly in a Plain-Dealer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that either his Friends will reward him, or his Enemies forgive him. For which Reaſon, I thought it was the ſhorteſt Way to Impartiality, to put my ſelf beyond further Hopes or Fears, by declaring my ſelf, at a Time when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is not about Perſons and Parties, but Things and Cauſes. To relieve my ſelf from the Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which naturally attends ſuch Reflections, I came hither this Evening to give my Thoughts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0397200204:26"/>
quite a new Turn, and converſe with Men of Pleaſure and Wit, rather than thoſe of Buſineſs and Intrigue. I had hardly entered the Room, when I was accoſted by Mr. <hi>Thomas Dogget,</hi> who deſired my Favour in Relation to the Play which was to be acted for his Benefit on <hi>Thurſday.</hi> He pleaſed me in ſaying it was <hi>The Old Batchelor,</hi> in which Comedy there is a neceſſary Circumſtance obſerv'd by the Author, which moſt other Poets either overlook or do not underſtand, that is to ſay, the Diſtinction of Characters. It is very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with Writers to indulge a certain Modeſty of believing all Men as witty as themſelves, and making all the Perſons of the Play ſpeak the Sentiments of the Author, without any Manner of Reſpect to the Age, Fortune, or Quality, of him that is on the Stage. Ladies talk like Rakes, and Footmen make Similes: But this Writer knows Men. which makes his Plays reaſonable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, while the Scenes of moſt others are like the Tunes between the Acts. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps agreeable Sounds, but they have no Idea's affixed to them. <hi>Dogget</hi> thanked me for my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to him in the Winter, and, after his Comick Manner, ſpoke his Requeſt with ſo arch a Leer, that I promiſed the Drole I would ſpeak to all my Acquaintance to be at his Play.</p>
               <p>Whatever the World may think of the Actors, whether it be that their Parts have an Effect on their Lives, or whatever it is, you ſee a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Benevolence among them towards the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Neceſſities of each other. <hi>Dogget</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not let me go, without delivering me a Letter from poor old <hi>Downes</hi> the Prompter, wherein that Retainer to the Theatre deſires my Advice and Aſſiſtance in a Matter of Concern to him. I have ſent him my private Opinion for his Conduct; but the Stage and the State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs being ſo much canvaſſed by Parties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I ſhall for ſome Time hereafter take Leave

of Subjects which relate to either of them, and employ my Care in the Conſideration of Matters which regard that Part of Mankind who live without intereſting themſelves with the Troubles or Pleaſures of either. However, for a meer Notion of the preſent Poſture of the Stage, I ſhall give you the Letter at large as follows:</p>

                     <p>FInding by divers of your late Papers, that you are a Friend to the Profeſſion of which I was many Years an unworthy Member, I the rather make bold to crave your Advice, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Propoſal that has been lately made me of coming again into Buſineſs, and the Sub-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Stage Affairs. I have, from my Youth, been bred up behind the Curtain, and been a Prompter from the Time of the Reſtoration. I have ſeen many Changes, as well of Scenes as of Actors, and have known Men within my Remembrance arrive to the higheſt Dignities of the Theatre, who made their Entrance in the Quality of Mutes, Joint-ſtools, Flower-pots, and Tapeſtry Hangings. It cannot be unknown to the Nobility and Gentry, That a Gentleman of the Inns of Court, and a deep Intriguer, had ſome Time ſince worked himſelf into the ſole Management and Direction of the Theatre. Nor is it leſs notorious, That his reſtleſs Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and ſubtle Machinations, did manifeſtly tend to the Extirpation of the good old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Actors, and the Introduction of foreign Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders; ſuch as Harlequins, <hi>French</hi> Dancers, and <hi>Roman</hi> Singers; which, though they impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh'd the Proprietors, and impoſed on the Audience, were for ſome Time tolerated, by Reaſon of his dextrous Inſinuations, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon a few deluded Women, eſpecially the Vizard Masks, to believe that the Stage was in Danger. But his Schemes were ſoon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0397200204:28"/>
expoſed, and the Great Ones that ſupported him withdrawing their Favour, he made his Exit, and remained for a Seaſon in Obſcurity. During this Retreat the Machiavilian was not idle, but ſecretly fomented Diviſions, and wrought over to his Side ſome of the inferior Actors, reſerving a Trap Door to himſelf, to which only he had a Key. This Entrance ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, this cunning Perſon, to compleat his Company, bethought himſelf of calling in the moſt eminent of Strollers from all Parts of the Kingdom. I have ſeen them all ranged toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behind the Scenes; but they are many of them Perſons that never trod the Stage before, and ſo very aukward and ungainly, that it is impoſſible to believe the Audience will bear them. He was looking over his Catalogue of Plays, and indeed picked up a good tolerable Set of grave Faces for Counſellors, to appear in the famous Scene of <hi>Venice Preſerv'd,</hi> when the Danger is over; but they being but meer Outſides, and the Actors having a great Mind to play <hi>The Tempeſt,</hi> there is not a Man of them, when he is to perform any Thing above Dumb Show, is capable of acting with a good Grace ſo much as the Part of <hi>Trincalo.</hi> However, the Maſter perſiſts in his Deſign, and is fitting up the old Storm; but I am afraid he will not be able to procure able Sailors or experienced Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for Love or Money.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, when he comes to caſt the Parts, there is ſo great a Confuſion amongſt them for Want of proper Actors, that for my Part I am wholly diſcouraged. The Play with which they deſign to open is, <hi>The Duke and no Duke;</hi> and they are ſo put to it, that the Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is to act the Conjurer, and they have no one for the General but honeſt <hi>George Powell.</hi>

               <p>I Was this Morning reading the Tenth Canto in the Fourth Book of <hi>Spencer,</hi> in which Sir <hi>Scudamore</hi> relates the Progreſs of his Courtſhip to <hi>Amoret</hi> under a very beautiful Allegory, which is one of the moſt natural and unmixed of any in that moſt excellent Author. I ſhall tranſproſe it, to uſe Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>'s Term, for the Benefit of many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lovers, who have by frequent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deſired me to lay down ſome Rules for the Conduct of their virtuous Amours; and ſhall

                  </gap> meant a generous, conſtant Paſſion for the Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon beloved.</p>
               <p>When the Fame, ſays he, of this celebrated Beauty firſt flew Abroad, I went in Purſuit of her to the <hi>Temple of Love.</hi> This Temple, continues he, bore the Name of the Goddeſs <hi>Venus,</hi> and was ſeated in a moſt fruitful Iſland, walled by Nature againſt all Invaders. There was a ſingle Bridge that led into the Iſland, and before it a Caſtle garriſon'd by Twenty Knights. Near the Caſtle was an open Plain, and in the midſt of it a Pillar, on which was hung the Shield of Love; and underneath it, in Letters of Gold, was this Inſcription:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Happy the Man who well can uſe his Bliſs;</l>
                  <l>Whoſe ever be the Shield, Fair <hi>Amoret</hi> be his.</l>
               </q>
               <p>My Heart panted upon reading the Inſcription: I ſtruck upon the Shield with my Spear. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately iſſued forth a Knight well mounted, and compleatly armed, who, without ſpeaking, ran fiercely at me. I received him as well as I could, and by good Fortune threw him out of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. I encountered the whole Twenty ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and leaving them all extended on the Plain, carried off the Shield in Token of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Having thus vanquiſh'd my Rivals, I paſſed on without Impediment, till I came to the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Gate of the Bridge, which I found locked and barred. I knocked and called, but could get no Anſwer. At laſt I ſaw one on the other Side of the Gate, who ſtood peeping through a ſmall Crevice. This was the Porter; he had a double Face reſembling a <hi>Janus,</hi> and was continually looking about him, as if he miſtruſted ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Danger. His Name, as I afterwards learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was <hi>Doubt.</hi> Over-againſt him ſat <hi>Delay,</hi> who entertained Paſſengers with ſome idle Story, while they loſt ſuch Opportunities as were never
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0397200204:31"/>
to be recovered. As ſoon as the Porter ſaw my Shield, he opened the Gate; but upon my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, <hi>Delay</hi> caught hold of me, and would fain have made me liſten to her Fooleries. However, I ſhook her off, and paſſed forward till I came to the Second Gate, <hi>The Gate of good Deſert,</hi> which always ſtood wide open, but in the Porch was an hideous Giant, that ſtop'd the Entrance: His Name was <hi>Danger.</hi> Many Warriors of good Reputation, not able to bear the Sternneſs of his Look, went back again. Cowards fled at the firſt Sight of him, except ſome few, who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Opportunity, ſlipt by him unobſerv'd. I prepared to aſſault him; but upon the firſt Sight of my Shield, he immediately gave Way. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back upon him, I found his hinder Parts much more deformed and terrible than his Face; <hi>Hatred, Murther, Treaſon, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Detraction,</hi> lying in Ambuſh behind him, to fall upon the Heedleſs and Unwary.</p>
               <p>I now entered <hi>The Iſland of Love,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in all the Beauties of Art and Nature, and feaſted every Senſe with the moſt agreeable Objects. Amidſt a pleaſing Variety of Walks and Allies, ſhady Seats, and flowry Banks, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hills, and gloomy Valleys, were Thouſands of Lovers ſitting, or walking together in Pairs, and ſinging Hymns to the Deity of the Place.</p>
               <p>I could not forbear envying this happy People, who were already in Poſſeſſion of all they could deſire. While I went forward to the Temple, the Structure was beautiful beyond Imagination. The Gate ſtood open. In the Entrance ſat a moſt amiable Woman, whoſe Name was <hi>Concord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On either Side of her ſtood Two young Men, both ſtrongly armed, as if afraid of each other. As I afterwards learned they were both her Sons, but begotten of her by Two different Fathers; their Names, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0397200204:32"/>
The Lady ſo well tempered and reconciled them both, that ſhe forced them to join Hands, tho' I could not but obſerve, that <hi>Hatred</hi> turned aſide his Face, as not able to endure the Sight of his younger Brother.</p>
               <p>I at length entered the Inmoſt Temple, the Roof of which was raiſed upon an Hundred Marble Pillars, decked with Crowns, Chains, and Garlands. The Ground was ſtrowed with Flowers. An Hundred Altars, at each of which ſtood a Virgin Prieſteſs cloathed in White, blazed all at once with the Sacrifice of Lovers, who were perpetually ſending up their Vows to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Clouds of Incenſe.</p>
               <p>In the Midſt ſtood the Goddeſs her ſelf, upon an Altar, whoſe Subſtance was neither Gold nor Stone, but infinitely more precious than either. About her Neck flew numberleſs Flocks of little <hi>Loves, Joys,</hi> and <hi>Graces;</hi> and all about her Altar lay ſcattered Heaps of <hi>Lovers,</hi> complaining of the Diſdain, Pride, or Treachery, of their Miſtreſſes. One among the reſt, no longer able to contain his Griefs, broke out into the following Prayer: <q rend="inline">'<hi>Venus,</hi> Queen of Grace and Beauty, Joy of Gods and Men, who with a Smile becalmeſt the Seas, and reneweſt all Nature; Goddeſs, whom all the different Species in the Univerſe obey with Joy and Pleaſure, grant I may at laſt obtain the Object of my Vows.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The impatient Lover pronounced this with great Vehemence; but I in a ſoft Murmur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Goddeſs to lend me her Aſſiſtance. While I was thus praying, I chanced to caſt my Eye on a Company of Ladies, who were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in a Corner of the Temple waiting for the Anthem.</p>
               <p>The foremoſt ſeemed ſomething elder, and of a more compoſed Countenance than the reſt, who all appeared to be under her Direction. Her Name was <hi>Womanhood.</hi> On one Side of her ſat
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0397200204:33"/>
                  <hi>Shamefacedneſs,</hi> with Bluſhes riſing in her Cheeks, and her Eyes fixed upon the Ground: On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> with a ſmiling Look, that infuſed a ſecret Pleaſure into the Hearts of all that ſaw her. With theſe ſat <hi>Modeſty,</hi> holding her Hand on her Heart; <hi>Courteſie,</hi> with a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſpect, and obliging Behaviour; and the Two Siſters, who were always linked together, and reſembled each other, <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus ſat they all around in ſeemly Rate,</l>
                  <l>And in the Midſt of them a goodly Maid;</l>
                  <l>Ev'n in the Lap of <hi>Womanhood</hi> there ſate,</l>
                  <l>The which was all in Lilly-white array'd,</l>
                  <l>Where Silver Streams among the Linen ſtray'd;</l>
                  <l>Like to the Morn, when firſt her ſhining Face</l>
                  <l>Hath to the Gloomy World it ſelf bewray'd.</l>
                  <l>That ſame was faireſt <hi>Amoret</hi> in Place,</l>
                  <l>Shining with Beauty's Light, and Heav'nly Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue's Grace.</l>
               </q>
               <p>As ſoon as I beheld the charming <hi>Amoret,</hi> my Heart throbbed with Hopes. I ſtepped to her, and ſeized her Hand; when <hi>Womanhood</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately riſing up, ſharply rebuked me for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo rude a Manner to lay hold on a Virgin. I excuſed my ſelf as modeſtly as I could, and at the ſame Time diſplayed my Shield; upon which, as ſoon as ſhe beheld the God emblazoned with his Bow and Shafts, ſhe was ſtruck mute, and inſtantly retired.</p>
               <p>I ſtill held faſt the fair <hi>Amoret,</hi> and turning my Eyes towards the Goddeſs of the Place, ſaw that ſhe favoured my Pretenſions with a Smile, which ſo emboldened me, that I carried off my Prize.</p>
               <p>The Maid, ſometimes with Tears, ſometimes with Smiles, entreated me to let her go: But I led her through the Temple-Gate, where the Goddeſs <hi>Concord,</hi> who had favoured my Entrance, befriended my Retreat.</p>

This Allegory is ſo natural, that it explains it ſelf. The Perſons in it are very artfully deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and diſpoſed in proper Places. The Poſts aſſigned to <hi>Doubt, Delay,</hi> and <hi>Danger,</hi> are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The Gate of <hi>Good Deſert</hi> has ſomething noble and inſtructive in it. But above all, I am moſt pleaſed with the beautiful Grouppe of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the Corner of the Temple. Among theſe, <hi>Womanhood</hi> is drawn like what the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers call an Univerſal Nature, and is attended with beautiful Repreſentatives of all thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that are the Ornaments of the Female Sex, conſidered in its natural Perfection and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>

               <p>THE Learned World are very much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at many of my Ratiocinations, and have but a very mean Opinion of me as a Politician. The Reaſon of this is, That ſome erroneouſly conceive a Talent for Politicks to conſiſt in the Regard to a Man's own Intereſt; but I am of quite another Mind, and think the firſt and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Quality towards being a Stateſman is to have a publick Spirit. One of the Gentlemen who are out of Humour with me, imputes my falling into a Way wherein I am ſo very aukward to a Barrenneſs of Invention, and has the Charity to lay new Matter before me for the future. He is at the Bottom my Friend, but is at a Loſs to know whether I am a Fool or a Phyſician, and is pleaſed to expoſtulate with me with Relation to the latter. He falls heavy upon Licentiates, and ſeems to point more particularly at us who are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0397200204:35"/>
not regularly of the Faculty. But ſince he has been ſo civil to me as to meddle only with thoſe who are employed no further than about Men's Lives, and not reflected upon me as of the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Sect, who concern our ſelves about Lives and Fortunes alſo, I am not ſo much hurt as to ſtifle any Part of his fond Letter.</p>

                     <p>I Am afraid there is ſomething in the Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of ſome People, that you begin to be ſhort of Matter for your Lucubrations. Tho' ſeveral of them now and then did appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dull and inſipid to me, I was always cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably inclined to believe the Fault lay in my ſelf, and that I wanted the true Key to unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher your Myſteries, and remember your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement upon this Account. But ſince I have ſeen you fall in an unpardonable Error, yea, with a Relapſe: I mean, ſince I have ſeen you turn Politician in the preſent unhappy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions. I have begun to ſtagger, and could not chuſe but leſſen the great Value I had for the Cenſor of our Iſle. How is it poſſible that a Man, whom Intereſt did naturally lead to a conſtant Impartiality in theſe Matters, and who hath Wit enough to judge, that his Opinion was not like to make many Proſelytes? How is it poſſible, I ſay, that a little Paſſion (for I have ſtill too good an Opinion of you to think you was bribed by the Staggering Party) could blind you ſo far as to offend the very better half of the Nation, and to leſſen off ſo much the Number of your Friends? Mr. <hi>Morphew</hi> will not have Cauſe to thank you, unleſs you give over, and endeavour to regain what you have loſt. There is ſtill a great many Themes you have left untouched; ſuch as the ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Matters relating to Law and Phyſick, the ſetting down Rules for knowing the Quacks
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0397200204:36"/>
in both Profeſſions. What a large Field is there left in diſcovering the Abuſes of the College, who had a Charter and Privileges granted them to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of Quacks and Pretenders; and yet grant Licences to Barbers, and write Letters of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Country Towns, out of the Reach of their Practice, in Favour of meer Boys; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing the Health and Lives of their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men no farther than they get Money by them. You have ſaid very little or nothing about the Diſpenſation of Juſtice in Town and Country, where Clerks are the Counſellors to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                     <p>But as I can't expect that the Cenſor of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſhould publiſh a Letter, wherein he is cenſured with too much Reaſon himſelf; yet I hope you will be the better for it, and think upon the Themes I have mentioned, which muſt certainly be of greater Service to the World, your ſelf, and Mr. <hi>Morphew,</hi> than to let us know whether you are a <hi>Whig</hi> or a <hi>Tory.</hi> I am ſtill</p>

               <p>This Gentleman and I differ about the Words, Staggering and Better Part; but inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the Particulars of this Epiſtle, I ſhall only acquaint my Correſpondent, That I am at preſent forming my Thoughts upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir <hi>Scudamore</hi>'s Progreſs in <hi>Spencer,</hi> which has led me from all other Amuſements, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the State of Love in this Iſland; and from the Corruptions in the Government of that, to deduce the chief Evils of Life. In the mean Time that I am thus employed, I have given po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Orders to Don <hi>Saltero</hi> of <hi>Chelſea</hi> the Tooth-Drawer, and Dr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> the Corn-Cutter of <hi>King-ſtreet, Weſtminſter,</hi> (who have the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty

to confine their Pretenſions to Manual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) to bring me in, with all convenient Speed, compleat Liſts of all who are but of equal Learning with themſelves, and yet adminiſter Phyſick beyond the Feet and Gums. Theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices I ſhall reſerve for my future Leiſure; but have now taken a Reſolution to dedicate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Part of this Inſtant <hi>July</hi> to the Service of the Fair Sex, and have almoſt finiſhed a Scheme for ſettling the whole Remainder of that Sex who are unmarried, and above the Age of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five.</p>
               <p>In order to this good and publick Service, I ſhall conſider the Paſſion of Love in its full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as it is attended both with Joys and Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and lay down, for the Conduct of my Lovers, ſuch Rules as ſhall baniſh the Cares, and heighten the Pleaſures, which flow from that amiable Spring of Life and Happineſs. There is no leſs than an abſolute Neceſſity that ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion be made to take off the dead Stock of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in City, Town, and Country. Let there happen but the leaſt Diſorder in the Streets. and in an Inſtant you ſee the Inequality of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Males and Females. Beſides that the Feminine Crowd on ſuch Occaſions is more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in the open Way, you may obſerve them alſo to the very Garrets huddled together, Four at leaſt at a Caſement. Add to this, that by an exact Calculation of all that have come to Town by Stage-Coach or Waggon for this Twelvemonth laſt, Three Times in Four the treated Perſons have been Males. This over-ſtock of Beauty, for which there are ſo few Bidders, calls for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Supply of Lovers and Husbands; and I am the ſtudious Knight-Errant who have ſuffer'd long Nocturnal Contemplations to find out Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the Relief of all <hi>Britiſh</hi> Females, who at preſent ſeem to be devoted to involuntary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.

               <p>THE intended Courſe of my Studies was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered this Evening by a Viſit from an old Acquaintance, who complained to me, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one upon whom he had long depended, that he found his Labour and Perſeverance in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's Service and Intereſts wholly ineffectual; and he thought now, after his beſt Years were ſpent in a profeſſed Adherence to him and his Fortunes, he ſhould in the End be forced to break with him, and give over all further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from him. He ſighed, and ended his Diſcourſe, by ſaying, <q rend="inline">'You, Mr. Cenſor, ſome Time ago, gave us your Thoughts of the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of great Men to their Creditors.'</q> This Sort of Demand upon them, for what they invite Men to expect, is a Debt of Honour, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom, they ought to be moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of paying, and would be a very worthy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for a Lucubration.</p>
               <p>Of all Men living, I think, I am the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to treat of this Matter; becauſe in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Employment of Cenſor, I have had Encouragement ſo infinitely above my Deſert, that what I ſay cannot poſſibly be ſuppoſed to ariſe from Peeviſhneſs, or any Diſappointment in that Kind which I my ſelf have met with. When we conſider Patrons and their Clients, thoſe who receive Addreſſes, and thoſe who are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0397200204:40"/>
addreſſed to, it muſt not be underſtood that the Dependants are ſuch as are worthleſs in their Natures, abandoned to any Vice or Diſhonour, or ſuch as without a Call thruſt themſelves upon Men in Power; nor when we ſay Patrons, do we mean ſuch as have it not in their Power, or have no Obligation to aſſiſt their Friends; but we ſpeak of ſuch Leagues where there are Power and Obligation on the one Part, and Merit and Expectation on the other. Were we to be very particular on this Subject, I take it, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Patron and Client may include a Third Part of our Nation. The Want of Merit and real Worth will ſtrike out about Ninety nine in the Hundred of theſe, and Want of Ability in the Patron will diſpoſe of as many of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He who out of meer Vanity to be applied to will take up another's Time and Fortune in his Service, where he has no Proſpect of returning it, is as much more unjuſt as thoſe who took up my Friend the Upholder's Goods without paying him for them. I ſay, he is much more unjuſt, as our Life and Time is more valuable than our Goods and Moveables. Among many whom you ſee about the Great, there is a contented well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed Set, who ſeem to like the Attendance for its own Sake, and are early at the Abodes of the powerful, out of meer Faſhion. This Sort of Vanity is as well grounded, as if a Man ſhould lay aſide his own plain Suit, and dreſs himſelf up in a gay Livery of anothers.</p>
               <p>There are many of this Species who exclude others of juſt Expectation, and make thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dependants appear impatient, becauſe they are not ſo chearful as thoſe who expect nothing. I have made uſe of the Penny-Poſt for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of theſe voluntary Slaves, and informed them, that they will never be provided for; but they double their Diligence upon Admonition. <hi>Will Afterday</hi> has told his Friends, that he was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0397200204:41"/>
to have the next Thing theſe Ten Years; and <hi>Harry Linger</hi> has been Fourteen within a Month of a conſiderable Office. However, the fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Complaiſance which is paid to them may blind the Great from ſeeing themſelves in a juſt Light, they muſt needs (if they in the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect) at ſome Times have a Senſe of the Injuſtice they do in raiſing in others a falſe Expectation. But this is ſo common a Practice in all the Stages of Power, that there are not more Cripples come out of the Wars, than from the Attendance of Patrons. You ſee in one a ſettled Melancholy, in another a bridled Rage, a Third has loſt his Memory, and a Fourth his whole Conſtitution and Humour. In a Word, when you ſee a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſt of Mind or Body, which looks a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon the Diſtracted, you may be ſure the poor Gentleman has formerly had great Friends. For this Reaſon, I have thought it a prudent Thing to take a Nephew of mine out of a Ladies Service, where he was a Page, and have bound him to a Shoemaker.</p>
               <p>But what of all the Humours under the Sun is the moſt pleaſant to conſider, is, That you ſee ſome Men lay as it were a Set of Acquaintance by them, to converſe with when they are out of Employment, who had no Effect of their Power when they were in. Here Patrons and Clients both make the moſt fantaſtical Figure imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Friendſhip indeed is moſt manifeſted in Adverſity; but I do not know how to behave my ſelf to a Man who thinks me his Friend at no other Time but that. <hi>Dick Reptile</hi> of our Club had this in his Head t'other Night, when he ſaid, I am afraid of ill News when I am viſited by any of my old Friends. Theſe Patrons are a little like ſome fine Gentlemen, who ſpend all their Hours of Gaiety with their Wenches, but when they fall ſick, will let no one come near them but their Wives. It ſeems, Truth and Honour
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0397200204:42"/>
are Companions too ſober for Proſperity. It is certainly the moſt black Ingratitude to accept of a Man's beſt Endeavours to be pleaſing to you, and return it with Indifference.</p>
               <p>I am ſo much of this Mind, that <hi>Dick Eaſtcourt</hi> the Comedian, for coming one Night to our Club, tho' he laughed at us all the Time he was there, ſhall have our Company at his Play on <hi>Thurſday.</hi> A Man of Talents is to be favoured, or never admitted. Let the ordinary World truck for Money and Wares, but Men of Spirit and Converſation ſhould in every Kind do others as much Pleaſure as they receive from them. But Men are ſo taken up with outward Forms, that they do not conſider their Actions; elſe how ſhould it be, that a Man ſhall deny that to the Entreaties and almoſt Tears of an old Friend, which he ſhall ſolicit a new one to accept of? I remember, when I firſt came out of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> I had an Intimacy with a Man of Quality, in whoſe Gift there fell a very good Employment. All the Town cry'd, There's a Thing for Mr. <hi>Bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſtaff!</hi> When, to my great Aſtoniſhment, I found my Patron had been forced upon Twenty Artifices to ſurprize a Man with it who never thought of it: But ſure it is a Degree of Murder to amuſe Men with vain Hopes. If a Man takes away another's Life, where is the Difference, whether he does it by taking away the Minutes of his Time, or the Drops of his Blood? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſuch as have Hearts barren of Kindneſs are ſerved accordingly by thoſe whom they employ, and paſs their Lives away with an empty Shew of Civility for Love, and an inſipid Intercourſe of a Commerce in which their Affections are no way concerned. But on the other Side, How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the Life of a Patron who performs his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Inferiors? A worthy Merchant, who employs a Crowd of Artificers? A great Lord, who is generous and merciful to the ſeveral Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0397200204:43"/>
of his Tenants? A Courtier, who uſes his Credit and Power for the Welfare of his Friends? Theſe have in their ſeveral Stations a quick Reliſh of the exquiſite Pleaſure of doing Good. In a Word, good Patrons are like the Guardian Angels of <hi>Plato,</hi> who are ever buſy, though unſeen, in the Care of their Wards; but ill Patrons are like the Deities of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, indolent, and unconcerned, though they ſee Mortals in Storms and Tempeſts even while they are offering Incenſe to their Power.</p>

               <p>WHEN I came hither this Evening, the Man of the Houſe delivered me a Book very finely bound. When I received it, I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard one of the Boys whiſper another, and ſay, It was a fine Thing to be a great Scholar! What a pretty Book that is! It has indeed a very gay Outſide, and is dedicated to me by a very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman, who does not put his Name to it. The Title of it (for the Work is in <hi>Latin</hi>) is, <hi>Epiſtolarum Obſcurorum Virorum, ad Dm. M. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuinum Gratium, Volumina</hi> II. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> "The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Obſcure Writers to <hi>Ortuinus, &amp;c.</hi>" The Purpoſe of the Work is ſignified in the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in very elegant Language, and fine Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. It ſeems, this is a Collection of Letters which ſome profound Blockheads, who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Times, have written in Honour of each
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0397200204:44"/>
other, and for their mutual Information in each others Abſurdities. They are moſtly of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Nation, whence from Time to Time Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Writers have flow'd, more pernicious to the Learned World than the Swarms of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> to the Politick. It is, methinks, wonderful, that Fellows could be awake, and utter ſuch incoherent Conceptions, and converſe with great Gravity like learned Men, without the leaſt Taſt of Knowledge or good Senſe. It would have been an endleſs Labour to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any other Method of expoſing ſuch Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, than by an Edition of their own Works, where you ſee their Follies, according to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſuch Virtuoſi, in a moſt correct Edition.</p>
               <p>Looking over theſe accompliſh'd Labours, I could not but reflect upon the immenſe Load of Writings which the Commonalty of Scholars have puſhed into the World, and the Abſurdity of Parents, who educate Crowds to ſpend their Time in Purſuit of ſuch cold and ſprightleſs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to appear in Publick. It ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fruitleſs Labour to attempt the Correction of the Taſt of our Contemporaries, except it was in our Power to burn all the ſenſeleſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our Anceſtors. There is a ſecret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity in Nature from Generation to Generation in the Blockheads of one Age to admire thoſe of another; and Men of the ſame Imperfections are as great Admirers of each other, as thoſe of the ſame Abilities.</p>
               <p>This great Miſchief of voluminous Follies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Misfortune which happens in all Ages, that Men of barren Genius's, but fertile Imaginations, are bred Scholars. This may at firſt appear a Paradox; but when we conſider the talking Creatures we meet in publick Places, it will no longer be ſuch. <hi>Ralph Shallow</hi> is a young Fellow, that has not by Nature any the leaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to ſtrike into what has not been obſerved
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0397200204:45"/>
and ſaid every Day of his Life by others; but with that Inability of ſpeaking any Thing that is uncommon, he has a great Readineſs at what he can ſpeak of, and his Imagination runs into all the different Views of the Subject he treats of in a Moment. If <hi>Ralph</hi> had Learning added to the common Chit-Chat of the Town, he would have been a Diſputant upon all Topicks that ever were conſidered by Men of his own Genius. As for my Part, I never am teazed by an empty Town-Fellow, but I bleſs my Stars that he was not bred a Scholar. This Addition, we muſt conſider, would have made him capable of maintaining his Follies. His being in the Wrong would have been protected by ſuitable Arguments; and when he was hedged in by Logical Terms, and falſe Appearances, you muſt have owned your ſelf convinced before you could then have got rid of him, and the Shame of his Triumph had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Pain of his Impertinence.</p>
               <p>There is a Sort of Littleneſs in the Minds of Men of wrong Senſe, which makes them much more inſufferable than meer Fools, and has the further Inconvenience of being attended by an endleſs Loquacity. For which Reaſon, it would be a very proper Work, if ſome Well-wiſher to humane Society would conſider the Terms upon which People meet in publick Places, in order to prevent the unſeaſonable Declamations which we meet with there. I remember, in my Youth it was an Humour at the Univerſity, when a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pretended to be more eloquent than ordinary, and had formed to himſelf a Plot to gain all our Admiration, or triumph over us with an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to either of which he had no Manner of Call; I ſay, in either of theſe Caſes, it was the Humour to ſhut one Eye. This whimſical Way of taking Notice to him of his Abſurdity, has prevented many a Man from being a Coxcomb. If amongſt us, on ſuch an Occaſion each Man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0397200204:46"/>
a voluntary Rhetorician ſome Snuff, it would probably produce the ſame Effect. As the Matter now ſtands, whether a Man will or no, he is obliged to be informed in whatever another pleaſes to entertain him with, tho' the Preceptor makes theſe Advances out of Vanity, and not to inſtruct, but inſult him.</p>
               <p>There is no Man will allow him who wants Courage to be called a Soldier; but Men who want good Senſe, are very frequently not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be Scholars, but eſteemed for being ſuch. At the ſame Time it muſt be granted, that as Courage is the natural Parts of a Soldier, ſo is a good Underſtanding of a Scholar. Such little Minds as theſe, whoſe Productions are collected in the Volume to which I have the Honour to be Patron, are the Inſtruments for artful Men to work with, and become popular with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Part of Mankind. In Courts, they make tranſparent Flatterers; in Camps, oſtentatious Bullies; in Colleges, unintelligible Pedants; and their Faculties are uſed accordingly by thoſe who lead them.</p>
               <p>When a Man who wants Judgment is admitted into the Converſation of reaſonable Men, he ſhall remember ſuch improper Circumſtances, and draw ſuch groundleſs Concluſions from their Diſcourſe, and that with ſuch Colour of Senſe, as would divide the beſt Set of Company that can be got together. It is juſt thus with a Fool who has a Familiarity with Books, he ſhall quote and recite one Author againſt another, in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſhall puzzle the beſt Underſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him; tho' the moſt ordinary Capacity may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it is only Ignorance which makes the Intricacy. All the true Uſe of that we call Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to ennoble and improve our natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and not to diſguiſe our Imperfections. It is therefore in vain for Folly to attempt to conceal it ſelf by the Refuge of Learned Languages. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0397200204:47"/>
does but make a Man more eminently the Thing which Nature made him; and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glottes,</hi> had he ſtudied leſs than he has, and writ only in his Mother Tongue, had been known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Great Britain</hi> for a Pedant.</p>

               <head>The Hiſtory of <hi>Caelia.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is not neceſſary to look back into the Firſt Years of this young Lady, whoſe Story is of Conſequence only as her Life has lately met with Paſſages very uncommon. She is now in the Twentieth Year of her Age, and owes a ſtrict, but chearful Education, to the Care of an Aunt, to whom ſhe was recommended by her dying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe Deceaſe was haſtened by an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable Affliction for the Loſs of her Mother. As <hi>Caelia</hi> is the Offspring of the moſt generous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that has been known in our Age, ſhe is adorned with as much Beauty and Grace as the moſt celebrated of her Sex poſſeſs; but her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Life, moderate Fortune, and religious Educaiton, gave her but little Opportunity, and leſs Inclination, to be admired in publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Her Abode has been for ſome Years a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Diſtance from the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0397200204:48"/>
where her Aunt and ſhe choſe to reſide, for the Advantage of that rapturous Way of Devotion which gives Extaſy to the Pleaſures of Innocence, and, in ſome Meaſure, is the immediate Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe Heavenly Enjoyments for which they are addreſſed.</p>
               <p>As you may trace the uſual Thoughts of Men in their Countenances, there appeared in the Face of <hi>Caelia</hi> a Chearfulneſs, the conſtant Companion of unaffected Virtue; and a Gladneſs, which is as inſeparable from true Piety. Her every Look and Motion ſpoke the peaceful, mild, reſigning, humble Inhabitant, that animated her beauteous Body. Her Air diſcovered her Body a meer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of her Mind, and not that her Thoughts were employed in ſtudying Graces and Attractions for her Perſon. Such was <hi>Caelia</hi> when ſhe was firſt ſeen by <hi>Palamede</hi> at her uſual Place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Palamede</hi> is a young Man of Two and twenty, well-faſhioned, learned, genteel, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, the Son and Heir of a Gentleman of a very great Eſtate, and himſelf poſſeſſed of a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one by the Gift of an Unkle. He became enamoured with <hi>Caelia,</hi> and after having learned her Habitation, had Addreſs enough to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Paſſion and Circumſtances with ſuch an Air of good Senſe and Integrity, as ſoon obtain'd Permiſſion to viſit and profeſs his Inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. <hi>Palamede</hi>'s preſent Fortune and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Expectations were no Way prejudicial to his Addreſſes; but after the Lovers had paſſed ſome Time in the agreeable Entertainments of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Courtſhip, <hi>Caelia</hi> one Day took Occaſion to interrupt <hi>Palamede</hi> in the Midſt of a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Diſcourſe of the Happineſs he promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſo accompliſhed a Companion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a ſerious Air, told him, there was another Heart to be won before he gained hers, which was that of his Father. <hi>Palamede</hi> ſeemed much diſturbed at the Overture, and lamented to her,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0397200204:49"/>
That his Father was one of thoſe too provident Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who only place their Thoughts upon bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Riches into their Families by Marriages, and are wholly inſenſible of all other Conſiderations. But the Strictneſs of <hi>Caelia</hi>'s Rules of Life made her inſiſt upon this Demand; and the Son, at a proper Hour, communicated to his Father the Circumſtances of his Love, and the Merit of the Object. The next Day the Father made her a Viſit. The Beauty of her Perſon, the Fame of her Virtue, and a certain irreſiſtible Charm in her whole Behaviour on ſo tender and delicate an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, wrought ſo much upon him, in Spight of all Prepoſſeſſions, that he haſtened the Marriage with an Impatience equal to that of his Son. Their Nuptials were celebrated with a Privacy ſuitable to the Character and Modeſty of <hi>Caelia,</hi> and from that Day, till a fatal one of laſt Week, they lived together with all the Joy and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which attend Minds entirely united.</p>
               <p>It ſhould have been intimated, That <hi>Palamede</hi> is a Student of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and uſually retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther early in a Morning, <hi>Caelia</hi> ſtill ſleeping.</p>
               <p>It happened a few Days ſince, that ſhe followed him thither to communicate to him ſomething ſhe had omitted in her redundant Fondneſs to ſpeak of the Evening before. When ſhe came to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Servant there told her, ſhe was coming with a Letter to her. While <hi>Caelia</hi> in an Inner Room was reading an Apology from her Husband, That he had been ſuddenly taken by ſome of his Acquaintance to dine at <hi>Brentford,</hi> but that he ſhould return in the Evening, a Country Girl, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently clad, asked, If thoſe were not the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Mr. <hi>Palamede?</hi> She was anſwered, They were, but that he was not in Town. The Stranger asked, When he was expected at Home? The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant replied, She would go in and ask his Wife. The young Woman repeated the Word Wife, and fainted. This Accident rais'd no leſs Curioſity
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0397200204:50"/>
when Amazement in <hi>Caelia,</hi> who cauſed her to be removed into the Inner Room. Upon proper Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to revive her, the unhappy young Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture returned to her ſelf, and ſaid to <hi>Caelia,</hi> with an earneſt and beſeeching Tone, Are you really Mr. <hi>Palamede</hi>'s Wife? <hi>Caelia</hi> replies, I hope I do not look as if I were any other in the Condition you ſee me. The Stranger anſwers, No, Madam, he is my Husband. At the ſame Inſtant ſhe threw a Bundle of Letters into <hi>Caelia</hi>'s Lap, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Truth of what ſhe aſſerted. Their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Innocence and Sorrow made them look at each other as Partners in Diſtreſs, rather than Rivals in Love. The Superiority of <hi>Caelia</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Genius gave her an Authority to examine into this Adventure as if ſhe had been offended againſt, and the other the Delinquent. The Stranger ſpoke in the following Manner:</p>
               <q>Madam,
<p>If it ſhall pleaſe you, Mr. <hi>Palamede</hi> having an Unkle of a good Eſtate near <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was bred at the School there, to gain the more his good Will by being in his Sight. His Unkle died, and left him the Eſtate, which my Husband now has. When he was a meer Youth he ſet his Affections on me; but when he could not gain his Ends he married me, making me and my Mother, who is a Farmer's Widow, ſwear we would never tell it upon any Account whatſoever; for that it would not look well for him to marry ſuch a one as me; beſides, that his Father would cut him off of the Eſtate. I was glad to have him in an honeſt Way, and he now and then came and ſtay'd a Night and away at our Houſe. But very lately he came down to ſee us, with a fine young Gentleman his Friend, who ſtay'd behind there with us, pretending to like the Place for the Summer; but ever ſince Maſter <hi>Palamede</hi> went, he has attempted to abuſe me;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0397200204:51"/>
and I ran hither to acquaint him with it, and avoid the wicked Intentions of his falſe Friend.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caelia</hi> had no more Room for Doubt, but left her Rival in the ſame Agonies ſhe felt her ſelf. <hi>Palamede</hi> returns in the Evening, and finding his Wife at his Chambers, learned all that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and haſtened to <hi>Caelia</hi>'s Lodgings.</p>
               <p>It is much eaſier to imagine than expreſs the Sentiments of either the Criminal or the Injured at this Encounter.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Palamede</hi> had found Way for Speech, he confeſſed his Marriage, and his placing his Companion on Purpoſe to vitiate his Wife, that he might break through a Marriage made in his Nonage, and devote his riper and knowing Years to <hi>Caelia.</hi> She made him no Anſwer; but retired to her Cloſet. He returned to the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he ſoon after received from her the following Letter:</p>

                     <p>YOU, who this Morning were the beſt, are now the worſt of Men who beath vital Air. I am at once overwhelmed with Love, Hatred, Rage, and Diſdain.

            <div type="article">
               <p>WHEN we revolve in our Thoughts ſuch Cataſtrophes as that in the Hiſtory of the unhappy <hi>Caelia,</hi> there ſeems to be ſomething ſo hazardous in the changing a ſingle State of Life into that of Marriage, that (it may happen) all the Precautions imaginable are not ſufficient to defend a Virgin from Ruin by her Choice. It ſeems a wonderful Inconſiſtence in the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publick Juſtice, that a Man who robs a Woman of an Ear-ring or a Jewel, ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Death; but one who by falſe Arts and Inſinuations ſhould take from her her very ſelf, is only to ſuffer Diſgrace. This excellent young Woman has nothing to conſolate her ſelf with, but the Reflection that her Sufferings are not the Effect of any Guilt or Miſconduct, and has for her Protection the Influence of a Power which, amidſt the unjuſt Reproach of all Mankind, can give not only Patience, but Pleaſure to Innocence in Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>As the Perſon who is the Criminal againſt <hi>Caelia</hi> cannot be ſufficiently puniſhed according to our preſent Law, ſo are there numberleſs unhappy Perſons without Remedy according to preſent Cuſtom. That great Ill which has prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us in theſe latter Ages, is the making even Beauty and Virtue the Purchaſe of Money. The Generality of Parents, and ſome of thoſe of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, inſtead of looking out for introducing Health of Conſtitution, Frankneſs of Spirit, or Dignity of Countenance, into their Families, lay out all their Thoughts upon finding out Marches for their Eſtates, and not their Children. You ſhall have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0397200204:53"/>
one form a Plot for the Good of his Family, that there ſhall not be Six Men in <hi>England</hi> capable of pretending to his Daughter. A Second ſhall have a Son obliged, out of meer Diſcretion, for fear of doing any Thing below himſelf, follow all the Drabs in Town. Theſe ſage Parents meet; and as there is no Paſs, no Courtſhip, between the young Ones, it is no unpleaſant Obſervation to behold how they proceed to Treaty. There is ever in the Behaviour of each ſomething that denotes his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; and honeſt <hi>Coupler</hi> the Conveniencer ſays, he can diſtinguiſh upon Sight of the Parties, before they have opened any Point of their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which of the Two has the Daughter to ſell. <hi>Coupler</hi> is of our Club, and I have frequently heard him declaim upon this Subject, and aſſert, that the Marriage-Settlements which are now uſed have grown faſhionable even within his Memory.</p>
               <p>When the Theatre in ſome late Reigns owed its chief Support to thoſe Scenes which were written to put Matrimony out of Countenance, and render that State terrible, then was it that Pin-Money firſt prevailed, and all the other Articles inſerted which create a Diffidence; and intimate to the young People, that they are very ſoon to be in a State of War with each other: Tho' this had ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happened, except the Fear of it had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. <hi>Coupler</hi> will tell you alſo, that Jointures were never frequent till the Age before his own; but the Women were contented with the Third Part of the Eſtate the Law allotted them, and ſcorned to engage with Men whom they thought capable of abuſing their Children. He has alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that thoſe who were the oldeſt Bench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when he came to the <hi>Temple</hi> told him, the firſt Marriage-Settlement of conſiderable Length was the Invention of an old Serjeant, who took the Opportunity of Two Teſty Fathers, who were ever ſquabbling to bring about an Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Children. Theſe Fellows knew each
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0397200204:54"/>
other to be Knaves, and the Serjeant took hold of their mutual Diffidence, for the Benefit of the Law, to extend the Settlement to Three Skins of Parchment.</p>
               <p>To this great Benefactor to the Profeſſion is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent Price Current of Lines and Words. Thus is Tenderneſs thrown out of the Queſtion; and the great Care is, What the young Couple ſhall do when they come to hate each other? I do not queſtion but from this one Humour of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, might very fairly be deduced not only our preſent Defection in Point of Morals, but alſo our Want of People. This has given Way to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Gallantries, that a Man is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable that deceives an innocent Woman, tho' ſhe has never ſo much Merit, if ſhe is below him in Fortune. The Man has no Diſhonour fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Treachery; and her own Sex are ſo debaſed by Force of Cuſtom, as to ſay in the Caſe of the Woman, How could ſhe expect he would marry her?</p>
               <p>By this Means the good Offices, the Pleaſures and Graces of Life, are not put into the Ballance: The Bridegroom has given his Eſtate out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and he has no more left but to follow the blind Decree of his Fate, whether he ſhall be ſucceeded by a Sot, or a Man of Merit, in his Fortune. On the other Side, a fine Woman, who has alſo a Fortune, is ſet up by Way of Auction; her firſt Lover has Ten to One againſt him. The very Hour after he has opened his Heart and his Rent-Roll, he is made no other Uſe of, but to raiſe her Price. She and her Friends loſe no Opportunity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it to call in new Bidders. While the poor Lover very innocently waits till the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries at the Inns of Court have debated about the Alliance, all the Partiſans of the Lady throw Difficulties in the Way, till other Offers come in; and the Man who came firſt is not put in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, till ſhe has been refuſed by half the Town.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0397200204:55"/>
If an Abhorrence to ſuch mercenary Proceedings were well ſettled in the Minds of my Fair Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thoſe of Merit would have a Way opened to their Advancement: nay, thoſe who abound in Wealth only, would in Reality find their Account in it. It would not be in the Power of their Prude Acquaintance, their Waiters, their Nurſes, Couſins and Whiſperers, to perſwade them, that there are not above Twenty Men in a Kingdom, (and thoſe ſuch as perhaps they may never ſet Eyes on) whom they can think of with Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the Caſe ſtands now, let any one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how the great Heireſſes, and thoſe to whom they were offered, for no other Reaſon but that they could make them ſuitable Settlements, live together. What can be more inſipid, if not loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, than for Two Perſons to be at the Head of a Crowd, who have as little Regard for them as they for each other, and behold one another in an affected Senſe of Proſperity, without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of that exquiſite Gladneſs at meeting, that ſweet Inquietude at parting, together with the Charms of Voice, Look, Geſture, and that general Benevolence between well choſen Lovers, which makes all Things pleaſe, and leaves not the leaſt Trifle indifferent.</p>
               <p>But I am diverted from theſe Sketches for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Eſſays, in Behalf of my numerous Clients of the Fair Sex, by a Notice ſent to my Office in <hi>Sheer-Lane,</hi> That a blooming Widow, in the Third Year of her Widowhood, and Twenty ſix of her Age, deſigns to take a Colonel of Twenty eight.

                     <p>YOU can't think it ſtrange if I, who know little of the World, apply to you for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the weighty Affair of Matrimony, ſince you your ſelf have often declared it to be of that Conſequence as to require the utmoſt Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Without farther Preface therefore, give me Leave to tell you, that my Father at his Death left me a Fortune ſufficient to make me a March for any Gentleman. My Mother (for ſhe is ſtill alive (is very preſſing with me to marry; and I am apt to think, to gratify her, I ſhall venture upon One of Two Gentlemen who at this Time make their Addreſſes to me. My Requeſt is, that you would direct me in my Choice; which that you may the better do, I ſhall give you their Characters; and to avoid Confuſion, deſire you to call them by the Names of <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0397200204:57"/>
                        <hi>Philander</hi> is young, and has a good Eſtate; <hi>Silvius</hi> is as young, and has a better. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has had a liberal Education, has ſeen the Town, is retired from thence to his Eſtate in the Country, is a Man of few Words, and much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Books. The latter was brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Father's Eye, who gave him juſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to enable him to keep his Accounts; but made him withal very expert in Country Buſineſs, ſuch as Ploughing, Sowing, Buying, Selling, and the like. They are both very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men, neither of their Perſons is diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor did I know which to prefer till I had heard them diſcourſe; when the Converſation of <hi>Philander</hi> ſo much prevailed, as to give him the Advantage, with me, in all other Reſpects. My Mother pleads ſtrongly for <hi>Silvius,</hi> and uſes theſe Arguments, That he not only has the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Eſtate at preſent, but by his good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and Management increaſes it daily; That his little Knowledge in other Affairs will make him eaſy and tractable; whereas (according to her) Men of Letters know too much to make good Husbands. To Part of this I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I anſwer effectually, by ſaying, <hi>Philander</hi>'s Eſtate is large enough; That they who think 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year ſufficient, make no Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and Three. I eaſily believe him leſs converſant in thoſe Affairs, the Knowledge of which ſhe ſo much commends in <hi>Silvius;</hi> but I think them neither ſo neceſſary or becoming in a Gentleman as the Accompliſhments of <hi>Philander.</hi> It is no great Character of a Man to ſay, He rides in his Coach and Six, and underſtands as much as he who follows his Plough. Add to this, That the Converſation of theſe Sort of Men ſeems ſo diſagreeable to me, that tho' they may make good Bailiffs, I can hardly be perſwaded they can be good Companions. 'Tis poſſible I may ſeem to have odd Notions, when I ſay I am
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0397200204:58"/>
not fond of a Man only for being of (what is called) a Thriving Temper. To conclude, I own I am at a Loſs to conceive how good Senſe ſhould make a Man an ill Husband, or converſing with Books leſs complaiſant.</p>

               <p>The Reſolution which this Lady is going to take, ſhe may very well ſay is founded on Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For after the Neceſſities of Life are ſerved, there is no manner of Competition between a Man of Liberal Education and an Illiterate. Men are not altered by their Circumſtances, but as they give them Opportunities of exerting what they are in themſelves; and a powerful Clown is a Tyrant in the moſt ugly Form he can poſſibly appear. There lies a ſeeming Objection in the thoughtful Manner of <hi>Philander:</hi> But let her conſider which ſhe ſhall oftener have Occaſion to wiſh, that <hi>Philander</hi> would ſpeak, or <hi>Silvius</hi> hold his Tongue.</p>
               <p>The Train of my Diſcourſe is prevented by the urgent Haſt of another Correſpondent.</p>

               <p>IT has been often aſſerted in theſe Papers, That the great Source of our wrong Purſuits is the impertinent Manner with which we treat Women, both in the common and important Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Life. In vain do we ſay, the whole Sex would run into <hi>England,</hi> while the Privileges which are allowed them, do no way ballance the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0397200204:61"/>
Inconveniencies ariſing from thoſe very Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Our Women have very much indulged to them in the Participation of our Fortunes and our Liberty; but the Errors they commit in the Uſe of either, are by no means ſo impartially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as the falſe Steps which are made by Men. In the Commerce of Lovers, the Man makes the Addreſs, aſſails, and betrays, and yet ſtands in the ſame Degree of Acceptance as he was in before he committed that Treachery: The Woman, for no other Crime but believing one whom ſhe thought loved her, is treated with Shineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference at the beſt, and commonly with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Scorn. He that is paſt the Power of Beauty, may talk of this Matter with the ſame Unconcern as of any other Subject: Therefore I ſhall take upon me to conſider the Sex, as they live within Rules, and as they tranſgreſs them. The ordinary Claſs of the Good or the Ill have very little Influence upon the Actions of others; but the Eminent in either Kind are thoſe who lead the World below them. The Ill are employed in communicating Scandal, Infamy, and Diſeaſe, like Furies; the Good diſtribute Benevolence, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Health, like Angels. The Ill are damped with Pain and Anguiſh at the Sight of all that is laudable, lovely, or happy. The Virtuous are touched with Commiſeration toward the Guilty, the Diſagreeable, and the Wretched. There are thoſe who betray the Innocent of their own Sex, and ſollicit the Lewd of ours. There are thoſe who have abandoned the very Memory, not only of Innocence, but Shame. There are thoſe who never forgave, nor could ever bear being forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There are alſo who viſit the Beds of the Sick, lull the Cares of the Sorrowful, and double the Joys of the Joyful. Such is the deſtroying Fiend, ſuch the Guardian Angel, Woman.</p>

               <p>Before I withdraw from Buſineſs for the Night, it is my Cuſtom to receive all Addreſſes to me, that others may go to Reſt as well as my ſelf, at leaſt as far as I can contribute to it. When I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to know if any would ſpeak with me, I was informed that Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> the Player, deſired to be admitted. He was ſo, and with much Modeſty acquainted me, as he did other People of Note, that <hi>Hamlet</hi> was to be acted on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next for his Benefit. I had long wanted to ſpeak with this Perſon, becauſe I thought I could admoniſh him of many Things which would tend to his Improvement. In the General I obſerved to him, That though Action was his Buſineſs, the Way to that Action was not to ſtudy Geſture, for the Behaviour would follow the Sentiments of the Mind.</p>
               <p>Action to the Player, is what Speech is to an Orator. If the Matter be well conceived, Words will flow with Eaſe: And if the Actor is well poſſeſſed of the Nature of his Part, a proper Action will neceſſarily follow. He informed me, That <hi>Wilks</hi> was to act <hi>Hamlet,</hi> I deſired him, to requeſt of him in my Name, That he would wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Mr. <hi>Betterton;</hi> for that he failed in no Part of <hi>Othello,</hi> but where he had him in View. An Actor's forming himſelf by the Carriage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is like the Trick among the Widows, who lament their Husbands as their Neighbours did theirs, and not according to their own Sentiments of the Deceaſed.</p>
               <p>There is a Fault alſo in the Audience which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts their Satisfaction very much, that is, the figuring to themſelves the Actor in ſome Part wherein they formerly particularly liked him, and not attending to the Part he is at that Time performing. Thus, whatever <hi>Wilks,</hi> (who is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0397200204:64"/>
the ſtricteſt Follower of Nature) is acting, the vulgar Spectators turn their Thoughts upon Sir <hi>Harry Wildair.</hi> When I had indulged the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity of an old Man for ſome Time in ſuch looſe Hints, I took my Leave of Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> and was told, Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Coffee-houſe would ſpeak with me. His Buſineſs was to deſire I would, as I am an Aſtrologer, let him know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand who were to have the Benefit-Tickets in the enſuing Lottery; which Knowledge he was of Opinion he could turn to great Account, as he was concerned in News.</p>
               <p>I granted his Requeſt, upon an Oath of Secrecy, That he would only make his own Uſe of it, and not let it be publickly known till after they were drawn. I had not done ſpeaking, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to me a Plan which he had formed of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Books, with the Names of all ſuch Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and the Numbers of their Tickets, as ſhould come to him, in order to give an Hourly Account of what Tickets ſhall come up during the whole Time of the Lottery, the Drawing of which is to begin on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next. I liked his Method of diſguiſing the Secret I had told him, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him a thriving Man who could ſo well watch the Motion of Things, and profit by a prevailing Humour and Impatience ſo aptly, as to make his honeſt Induſtry agreeable to his Cuſtomers, as it is to be the Meſſenger of their good Fortune.</p>

               <p>This fantaſtical Deſire of being remembered only by the Two firſt Letters of a Name, led me into the Contemplation of the Vanity and imperfect Attainments of Ambition in general.

The reſtleſs Deſire of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting themſelves above the common Level of Mankind is not to be reſiſted in ſome Tempers; and Minds of this Make may be obſerved in every Condition of Life. Where ſuch Men do not make to themſelves or meet with Employment, the Soil of their Conſtitution runs into Tares and Weeds. An old Friend of mine, who loſt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor's Poſt Forty Years ago, and quitted, has ever ſince ſtudied Maps, Encampments, Retreats, and Countermarches, with no other Deſign but to feed his Spleen and Ill-Humour, and furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Matter for arguing againſt all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Actions of others. He that at his firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in the World was the gayeſt Man in our Regiment, ventured his Life with Alacrity, and enjoyed it with Satisfaction, encouraged Men below him, and was courted by Men above him, has been ever ſince the moſt froward Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture breathing. His warm Complexion ſpends it ſelf now only in a general Spirit of Contradiction; for which he watches all Occaſions, and is in his Converſation ſtill upon Sentry, treats all Men like Enemies, with every other Impertinence of a ſpeculative Warrior.</p>
               <p>He that obſerves in himſelf this natural Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſhould take all imaginable Care to put his Mind in ſome Method of Gratification, or he will ſoon find himſelf grow into the Condition of this diſappointed Major. Inſtead of courting proper Occaſions to riſe above others, he will be ever ſtudious of pulling others down to him: It being the common Refuge of diſappointed Ambition, to eaſe themſelves by Detraction. It would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0397200204:67"/>
be no great Argument againſt Ambition, that there are ſuch mortal Things in the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of it; but it certainly is a forcible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that there can be no ſolid Happineſs in the Succeſs of it. If we value popular Praiſe, it is in the Power of the meaneſt of the People to diſturb us by Calumny. If the Fame of being happy, we cannot look into a Village but we ſee Crowds in actual Poſſeſſion of what we ſeek only the Appearance. To this may be added, that there is I know not what Malignity in the Minds of ordinary Men to oppoſe you in what they ſee you fond of; and it is a certain Exception againſt a Man's receiving Applauſe, that he viſibly courts it. However this is not only the Paſſion of great and undertaking Spirts, but you ſee it in the Lives of ſuch as one would believe were far enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Ways of Ambition. The Rural Squires of this Nation even eat and drink out of Vanity. A vain-glorious Fox-hunter ſhall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain half a County for the Oſtentation of his Beef and Beer, without the leaſt Affection for any of the Crowd about him. He feeds them, becauſe he thinks it a Superiority over them that he does ſo; and they devour him, becauſe they know he treats them out of Inſolence. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Ambition in Groteſque, but may figure to us the Condition of politer Men, whoſe only Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit is Glory. When the Superior acts out of a Principle of Vanity, the Dependant will be ſure to allow it him; becauſe he knows it deſtructive of the very Applauſe which is courted by the Man who favours him, and conſequently makes him nearer himſelf.</p>
               <p>But as every Man living has more or leſs of this Incentive, which makes Men impatient of an unactive Condition, and urges Men to attempt what may tend to their Reputation, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary they ſhould form to themſelves an Ambition which is in every Man's Power to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0397200204:68"/>
gratify. This Ambition would be independent, and would conſiſt only in acting what to a Man's own Mind appears moſt great and laudable. It is a Purſuit in the Power of every Man, and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a regular Proſecution of what he himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. It is what can be interrupted by no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Accidents, for no Man can be robbed of his good Intention. One of our Society of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> therefore ſtarted laſt Night a Notion which I thought had Reaſon in it. It is, methinks, ſaid he, an unreaſonable Thing, that Heroick Virtue ſhould (as it ſeems to be at preſent) be confined to a certain Order of Men, and be attainable by none but thoſe whom Fortune has elevated to the moſt conſpicuous Stations. I would have every Thing to be eſteemed as Heroick which is great and uncommon in the Circumſtances in the Man who performs it. Thus there would be no Virtue in humane Life which every one of the Species would not have a Pretence to arrive at, and an Ardency to exert. Since Fortune is not in our Power, let us be as little as poſſible in hers. Why ſhould it be neceſſary that a Man ſhould be rich, to be generous? If we meaſured by the Quality, and not the Quantity, of Things, the Particulars which accompany an Action, is what ſhould denominate it mean or great. The higheſt Station of humane Life is to be attained by each Man that pretends to it: For every Man can be as valiant, as generous, as wiſe, and as merciful, as the Faculties and Opportunities which he has from Heaven and Fortune will permit. He that can ſay to himſelf, I do as much good, and am as virtuous, as my moſt earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will allow me, whatever is his Station in the World, is to himſelf poſſeſſed of the higheſt Honour. If Ambition is not thus turned, it is no other than a continual Succeſſion of Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vexation. But when it has this Caſt, it invigorates the Mind, and the Conſciouſneſs of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0397200204:69"/>
its own Worth is a Reward which it is not in the Power of Envy, Reproach, or Detraction, to take from it. Thus the Seat of ſolid Honour is in a Man's own Boſom, and no one can want Support who is in Poſſeſſion of an honeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but he who would ſuffer the Reproaches of it for other Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. S.</hi> I was going on in my Philoſophy, when Notice was brought me, that there was a great Crowd in my Antichamber, who expected Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. When they were admitted, I found they all met at my Lodgings (each coming upon the ſame Errand) to know whether they were of the Fortunate in the Lottery which is now ready to be drawn. I was much at a Loſs how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate my ſelf from their Importunity; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Aſſembly made up of both Sexes, I ſignified to them, that in this Caſe it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Fortune is not blind, for all the Lots would fall upon the Wiſeſt and the Faireſt. This gave ſo general a Satisfaction, that the Room was ſoon emptied, and the Company retired with the beſt Air, and the moſt pleaſing Grace, I had any where obſerved. Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe now ſtood alone before me, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me, he had now not only prepared his Books, but had received a very great Subſcription already. His Deſign was, to advertiſe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers at their reſpective Places of Abode, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Hour after their Number is drawn, whether it was a Blank or Benefit, if the Adventurer lives within the Bills of Mortality, if he dwells in the Country, by the next Poſt. I encouraged the Man in his Induſtry, and told him, The ready Path to good Fortune, was to believe there was no ſuch Thing.</p>

               <p>IT is natural for the Imaginations of Men, who lead their Lives in too ſolitary a Manner, to prey upon themſelves, and form from their own Conceptions Beings and Things which have no Place in Nature. This often makes an Adept as much at a Loſs when he comes into the World as a meer Savage. To avoid therefore that Inepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for Society, which is frequently the Fault of us Scholars, and has to Men of Underſtanding and Breeding ſomething much more ſhocking and untractable than Ruſticity it ſelf, I take Care to viſit all publick Solemnities, and go into Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies as often as my Studies will permit. This being therefore the firſt Day of the Drawing of the Lottery, I did not neglect ſpending a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Time in the Crowd: But as much a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher as I pretend to be, I could not but look with a Sort of Veneration upon the Two Boys which received the Tickets from the Wheels, as the impartial and equal Diſpenſers of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which were to be diſtributed among the Crowd, who all ſtood expecting the ſame Chance. It ſeems at firſt Thought very wonderful, that one Paſſion ſhould ſo univerſally have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of another in the Poſſeſſion of Men's Minds as that in this Caſe; all in general have a ſecret Hope of the great Ticket: And yet Fear in another Inſtance, as in going into a Battle ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0397200204:71"/>
have ſo little Influence, as that though each Man believes there will be many Thouſands ſlain, each is conſident he himſelf ſhall eſcape. This Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty proceeds from our Vanity; for every Man ſees abundance in himſelf that deſerves Reward, and nothing which ſhould meet with Mortification. But of all the Adventurers that filled the Hall, there was one who ſtood by me, who I could not but fancy expected the Thouſand Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> as a meer Juſtice to his Parts and Induſtry. He had his Pencil and Table-Book, and was at the drawing of each Lot, counting how much a Man with Seven Tickets was now nearer the great Prize, by the ſtriking out another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Competitor. This Man was of the moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſtitution I had ever obſerved; his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were ſo active, that he worked in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Stretch of Hope and Fear. When one Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val fell before him, you might ſee a ſhort Gleam of Triumph in his Countenance, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vaniſhed at the Approach of another. What added to the Particularity of this Man, was, that he every Moment caſt a Look, either upon the Commiſſioners, the Wheels, or the Boys. I gently whiſpered him, and asked, When he thought the Thouſand Pounds would come up? Pugh! ſays he, Who knows that? And then looks upon a little Liſt of his own Tickets, which were pretty high in their Numbers, and ſaid it would not come this Ten Days. This Fellow will have a good Chance, though not that which he has put his Heart on. The Man is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically turned, and made for getting. The Simplicity and Eagerneſs which he is in, argues an Attention to his Point; though what he is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring at does not in the leaſt contribute to it. Were it not for ſuch honeſt Fellows as theſe, the Men who govern the reſt of their Species would have no Tools to work with: For the outward Show of the World is carried on by ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0397200204:72"/>
find out that they are doing nothing. I left my Man with great Reluctance, ſeeing the Care he took to obſerve the whole Conduct of the Perſons concerned, and compute the Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Chances with his own Hands and Eyes. Dear Sir, ſaid I, they muſt riſe early that cheat you. Ay, ſaid he, there's nothing like a Man's minding his Buſineſs himſelf. 'Tis very true, ſaid I, The Maſter's Eye makes the Horſe fat.</p>
               <p>As it is much the greater Number who are to go without Prizes, it is but very Expedient to turn our Lecture to the forming juſt Sentiments on the Subject of Fortune. One ſaid this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Chief Lot he was conſident would fall upon ſome Puppy; but this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is one of thoſe wrong Tempers who approve only the Unhappy, and have a natural Prejudice to the Fortunate. But as it is certain that there is a great Meanneſs in being attacked to a Man purely for his Fortune, there is no leſs a Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in diſliking him for his Happineſs. It is the ſame Perverſeneſs under different Colours, and both theſe Reſentments ariſe from meer Pride.</p>
               <p>The true Greatneſs of Mind conſiſts in valuing Men apart from their Circumſtances, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Behaviour in them. Wealth is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction only in Traffick; but it muſt not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as a Recommendation in any other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but only juſt as it is applied. It was very prettily ſaid, That we may learn the little Value of Fortune by the Perſons on whom Heaven is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beſtow it. However, there is not a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Part in Humane Life, than becoming Wealth and Greatneſs. He muſt be very well ſtock'd with Merit, who is not willing to draw ſome Superiority over his Friends from his Fortune; For it is not every Man that can entertain with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0397200204:73"/>
the Air of a Gueſt, and do good Offices with the Mien of one that receives them.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I cannot conceive how a Man can place himſelf in a Figure wherein he can ſo much enjoy his own Soul, and that greateſt of Pleaſures, the juſt Approbation of his own Actions, than as an Adventurer on this Occaſion, to ſit and ſee the Lots go off without Hope or Fear, perfectly unconcerned as to himſelf, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Part in the good Fortune of others.</p>
               <p>I will believe there are happy Tempers in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to whom all the Good that arrives to any of their Fellow-Creatures gives a Pleaſure. Theſe live in a Courſe of ſubſtantial and laſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and have the Satisfaction to ſee all Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gratify them. This State of Mind not only lets a Man into certain Enjoyments, but relieves him from as certain Anxieties. If you will not rejoice with happy Men, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at them. <hi>Dick Reptile</hi> alluded to this when he ſaid, He would hate no Man out of pure Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As for my own Part, I look at Fortune quite in another View than the reſt of the World; and, by my Knowledge in Futurity, tremble at the approaching Prize, which I ſee coming to a young Lady for whom I have much Tenderneſs; and have therefore writ her the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be ſent by Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> with the Notice of her Ticket.</p>

               <p>MAny are the Inconveniencies which happen from the improper Manner of Addreſs in common Speech, between Perſons of the ſame or of different Quality. Among theſe Errors, there is none greater than that of the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Uſe of Title, and a paraphraſtical Way of ſaying, You. I had the Curioſity the other Day to follow a Crowd of People near <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> who were conducting a paſſionate Woman who ſold Fiſh to a Magiſtrate, in order to explain ſome Words which were ill taken by one of her own Quality and Profeſſion in the publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. When ſhe came to make her Defence, ſhe was ſo very full of, His Worſhip, and of, If it ſhould pleaſe his Honour, that we could for ſome Time hardly hear any other Apology ſhe made for her ſelf, than that of attoning for the ill Language ſhe had been accuſed of towards her Neighbour by the great Civilities ſhe paid to her Judge. But this Extravagance in her Senſe of doing Honour, was no more to be wondered at, than that her many
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0397200204:76"/>
Rings on each Finger were worn as Inſtances of Finery and Dreſs. The Vulgar may thus heap and huddle Terms of Reſpect, and nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be expected from them; but for People of Rank to repeat Appellatives inſignificantly, is a Folly not to be endured, neither with Regard to our Times or our Underſtanding. It is below the Dignity of Speech to extend it with more Words or Phraſes than are neceſſary to explain our ſelves with Elegance: And it is, methinks, an Inſtance of Ignorance, if not of Servitude, to be redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in ſuch Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>I waited upon a Man of Quality ſome Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ago: He happened to be dreſſing; and his Shoemaker fitting him, told him, That if his Lordſhip would pleaſe to tread hard, or that if his Lordſhip would ſtamp a little, his Lordſhip would find his Lordſhip's Shoe will fit as eaſie as any Piece of Work his Lordſhip ſhould ſee in <hi>England.</hi> As ſoon as my Lord was dreſſed, a Gentleman approached him with a very good Air, and told him, he had an Affair which had long depended in the Lower Courts, which, through the Inadvertency of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors on the one Side, and the ill Arts of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries on the other, could not poſſibly be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled according to the Rules of the Lower Courts: That therefore he deſigned to bring his Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe of Lords next Seſſion, where he ſhould be glad if his Lordſhip ſhould happen to be preſent; for he doubted not but his Cauſe would be approved by all Men of Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. In this Place the Word Lordſhip was gracefully inſerted, becauſe it was applied to him in that Circumſtance wherein his Quality was the Occaſion of the Diſcourſe, and wherein it was moſt uſeful to the one, and moſt honourable to the other.</p>
               <p>This Way is ſo far from being diſreſpectful to the Honour of Nobles, that it is an Expedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0397200204:77"/>
for uſing them with greater Deference. I would not put Lordſhip to a Man's Hat, Gloves, Wig, or Cane; but to deſire his Lordſhip's Favour, his Lordſhip's Judgment, or his Lordſhip's Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, is a Manner of ſpeaking, which expreſſes an Alliance between his Quality and his Merit. It is this Knowledge which diſtinguiſhed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Shoemaker from that of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.

The Man is dead, but his Excellency will never die. It is, methinks, very unjuſt to laugh at a Quaker, becauſe he has taken up a Reſolution to treat you with a Word, the moſt expreſſive of Complaiſance that can be thought of, and with an Air of good Nature and Charity calls you Friend. I ſay, it is very unjuſt to rally him for this Term to a Stranger, when you your ſelves, in all your Phraſes of Diſtinction, confound Phraſes of Honour into no Uſe at all.</p>

               <p>NAture has implanted in us Two very ſtrong Deſires, Hunger for the Preſervation of the Individual, and Luſt for the Support of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; or, to ſpeak more intelligibly, the former to continue our own Perſons, and the latter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce others into the World. According as Men behave themſelves with regard to theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, they are above or below the Beaſts of the Field, which are incited by them without Choice or Reflection. But reaſonable Creatures correct theſe Incentives, and improve them into elegant Motives of Friendſhip and Society. It is chiefly from this homely Foundation, that we are under the Neceſſity of ſeeking for the agreeable Companion, and the honourable Miſtreſs. By this Cultivation of Art and Reaſon, our Wants are made Pleaſures, and the Gratification of our Deſires, under proper Reſtrictions, a Work no Way below our nobleſt Faculties. The wiſeſt Man may maintain his Character, and yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what Manner he ſhall beſt entertain his Friend, or divert his Miſtreſs: Nay, it is ſo far from being a Derogation to him, that he can in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of before I have provided for the numberleſs Crowd of Damſels I have propoſed to take Care of. The Subject therefore of the preſent Paper ſhall be that Part of Society which owes its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the common Neceſſity of Hunger. When this is conſidered as the Support of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may take in under the ſame Head Thirſt alſo; otherwiſe when we are purſuing the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the Drunkard may make his Eſcape. The true Choice of our Diet, and our Companions at it, ſeems to conſiſt in that which contributes moſt to Chearfulneſs and Refreſhment: And theſe certainly are beſt conſulted by Simplicity in the Food, and Sincerity in the Company. By this Rule are in the firſt Place excluded from Pretence to Happineſs all Meals of State and Ceremony, which are performed in dumb Shew, and greedy Sullenneſs. At the Boards of the Great, they ſay, you ſhall have a Number attending with as good Habits and Countenances as the Gueſts, which only Circumſtance muſt deſtroy the whole Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Repaſt: For if ſuch Attendants are introduced for the Dignity of their Appearance, modeſt Minds are ſhocked by conſidering them as Spectators, or elſe look upon them as Equals, for whoſe Servitude they are in a Kind of Suffering. It may be here added, that the ſumptuous Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to an ingenious Eye has often more the Air of an Altar than a Table. The next abſurd Way of enjoying our ſelves at Meals, is, where the Bottle is ply'd without being called for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Way is ſomewhat unaccountable; and placing much Thought either in too great Sumptuouſneſs and Elegance in this Matter, or wallowing in Noiſe and Riot at it, are both, tho' not equally, unaccountable. I have often conſidered theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent People with very great Attention, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeak of them with the Diſtinction of the Eaters, and the Swallowers. The Eaters ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all their Senſes and Underſtanding to this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: The Swallowers hurry themſelves out of both, without pleaſing this or any other Appetite at all. The latter are improved Brutes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer degenerated Men. I have ſometimes thought it would not be improper to add to my Dead and Living Men, Perſons in an intermediate State of Humanity, under the Appellation of Dozers. The Dozers are a Sect, who, inſtead of keeping their Appetites in Subjection, live in Subjection to them; nay, they are ſo truly Slaves to them, that they keep at too great a Diſtance ever to come into their Preſence. Within my own Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I know thoſe that I dare ſay have forgot that they ever were hungry, and are no leſs utter Strangers to Thirſt and Wearineſs, who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to Sauces for their Food, and to their Food for their Wearineſs.</p>
               <p>I have often wondered, confidering the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and choice Spirits that we have among our Divines, that they do not think of putting vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits into a more contemptible and unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Figure than they do at preſent. So many Men of Wit and Spirit as there are in Sacred Orders, have it in their Power to make the Faſhion of their Side. The Leaders in humane Society are more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevailed upon this Way than can eaſily be imagined. I have more than one in my Thoughts at this Time capable of doing this againſt all the Oppoſition of the moſt Witty, as well as the moſt Voluptuous. There may poſſibly be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Subjects, but ſure there are none more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0397200204:82"/>
uſeful. It is viſible, that tho' Mens Fortunes, Circumſtances, and Pleaſures, give them Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions too ſtrong to regard any Mention ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Puniſhments or Rewards, they will liſten to what makes them inconſiderable or mean in the Imaginations of others, and by Degrees in their own.</p>
               <p>It is certain ſuch Topicks are to be touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Light we mean, only by Men of the moſt conſummate Prudence, as well as excellent Wit: For theſe Diſcourſes are to be made, if made to run into Example, before ſuch as have their Thoughts more intent upon the Propriety than the Reaſon of the Diſcourſe. What indeed leads me into this Way of Thinking, is, That the laſt Thing I read was a Sermon of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>South,</hi> upon <hi>the Ways of Pleaſantneſs.</hi> This admirable Diſcourſe was made at Court, where the Preacher was too wiſe a Man not to believe, the greateſt Argument, in that Place, againſt the Pleaſures then in Vogue, muſt be, that they loſt greater Pleaſures by proſecuting the Courſe they were in. The Charming Diſcourſe has in it whatever Wit and Wiſdom can put together. This Gentleman has a Talent of making all his Faculties bear to the great End of his hallowed Profeſſion. Happy Genius! He is the better Man for being a Wit. The beſt Way to praiſe this Author is to quote him; and, I think, I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any Man to ſay a greater Thing of him, or his Ability, than that there are no Paragraphs in the whole Diſcourſe I ſpeak of below theſe which follow.</p>
               <p>After having recommended the Satisfaction of the Mind, and the Pleaſure of Conſcience, he proceeds:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>An ennobling Property of it is, That it is ſuch a Pleaſure as never ſatiates or wearies; for it properly affects the Spirit, and a Spirit feels no Wearineſs, as being privileged from the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0397200204:83"/>
Cauſes of it. But can the Epicure ſay ſo of any of the Pleaſures he ſo much dotes upon? Do they not expire while they ſatisfy, and after a few Minutes Refreſhment determine in Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Unquietneſs? How ſhort is the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between a Pleaſure and a Burthen? How undiſcernable the Tranſition from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Pleaſure dwells no longer upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petie than the Neceſſities of Nature, which are quickly and eaſily provided for; and then all that follows is a Load and an Oppreſſion. Every Morſel to a ſatisfied Hunger, is only a new Labour to a tired Digeſtion. Every Draught to him that has quenched his Thirſt, is but a further quenching of Nature, and a Proviſion for Rheum and Diſeaſes, a Drowning of the Quickneſs and Activity of the Spirits.</p>
                  <p>He that prolongs his Meals, and ſacrifices his Time, as well as his other Conveniencies, to his Luxury, How quickly does he outſit his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? And then, How is all the following Time beſtowed upon Ceremony and Surfeit? Till at length, after a long Fatigue of Eating, and Drinking, and Babbling, he concludes the great Work of dining genteely, and ſo makes a Shift to riſe from Table, that he may lie down upon his Bed; where, after he has ſlept himſelf into ſome Uſe of himſelf, by much ado he ſtaggers to his Table again, and there acts over the ſame brutiſh Scene: So that he paſſes his whole Life in a dozed Condition, between ſleeping and waking, with a Kind of Drowſineſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion upon his Senſes, which, what Pleaſure it can be, is hard to conceive. All that is of it dwells upon the Tip of his Tongue, and within the Compaſs of his Palate. A worthy Prize for a Man to purchaſe with the Loſs of his Time, his Reaſon, and himſelf!</p>

Words and Actions tend to the Advancement of his Reputation and of his Fortune, toward which he makes hourly Progreſs, becauſe he laviſhes no Part of his good Will upon ſuch as do not make ſome Advances to merit it. The Man who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues Affection, ſometimes becomes popular; he who aims at Eſteem, ſeldom falls of growing rich.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have looked at theſe different Men, as Perſons who endeavour to be valued and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved from Deſign, or Ambition; but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in quite another Figure, when you obſerve the Men who are agreeable and venerable from the Force of their natural Inclinations. We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Company of him who has leaſt Regard of himſelf in his Carriage, who throws himſelf into unguarded Gaiety, voluntary Mirth, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good Humour; who has nothing in his Head but the preſent Hour, and ſeems to have all his Intereſts and Paſſions gratified, if every Man elſe in the Room is as unconcerned as himſelf. This Man uſually has no Quality or Character among his Companions, let him be born of whom he will, have what great Qualities he pleaſe, let him be capable of aſſuming for a Moment what Figures he pleaſes, he ſtill dwells in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of all who know him but as <hi>Jack ſuch a One.</hi> This makes <hi>Jack</hi> brighten up the Room wherever he enters, and change the Severity of the Company into that Gaiety and good Humour into which his Converſation generally leads them. It is not unpleaſant to obſerve even this Sort of Creature go out of his Character, to check himſelf ſometimes for his Familiarities, and pretend ſo aukwardly at procuring to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more eſteem than he finds he meets with.

I did not mind his being a little out of Humour, but comforted him, by giving him ſeveral Inſtances of Men of our Acquaintance, who had no one Quality in any Eminence, that were much more eſteemed than he was with very many: But the Thing is, if your Character is to give Pleaſure, Men will conſider you only in that Light, and not in thoſe Acts which turn to Eſteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>

of Humour, and ſays, <q rend="inline">'It would be very well, if ſome People would examine into themſelves as much as they do into others.'</q> Or, <q rend="inline">'Sure there is nothing in the World ſo ridiculous as an amorous old Man.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>As I was ſaying, there is a Claſs which every Man is in by his Poſt in Nature, from which it is impoſſible for him to withdraw to another, and become it. Therefore it is neceſſary that each ſhould be contented with it, and not endeavour at any Progreſs out of that Tract. To follow Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the only agreeable Courſe; which is what I would fain inculcate to thoſe jarring Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <hi>Flavia</hi> and <hi>Lucia.</hi> They are Mother and Daughter. <hi>Flavia,</hi> who is the Mamma, has all the Charms and Deſires of Youth ſtill about her, and not much turned of Thirty: <hi>Lucia</hi> is bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and amorous, and but a little above Fifteen. The Mother looks very much younger than ſhe is, the Girl very much elder. If it were poſſible to fix the Girl to her ſick Bed, and preſerve the Portion (the Uſe of which the Mother partakes) the good Widow <hi>Flavia</hi> would certainly do it. But for fear of <hi>Lucia</hi>'s Eſcape, the Mother is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be conſtantly attended with a Rival, that explains her Age, and draws off the Eyes of her Admirers. The Jeſt is, they can never be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Strangers Company, but <hi>Lucy</hi> is eternally reprimanded for ſomething very particular in her Behaviour; for which ſhe has the Malice to ſay, She hopes ſhe ſhall always obey her Parents. She carried her Paſſion and Jealouſy to that Height the other Day, that coming ſuddenly into the Room, and ſurpriſing Colonel <hi>Lofty</hi> ſpeaking Rapture on one Knee to her Mother, ſhe clapped down by him, and asked her Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether it is ſo proper to tell Family Occurrences of this Nature; but we eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day ſee the ſame Thing happen in the publick Converſation in the World. Men cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0397200204:88"/>
with what is laudable, but they muſt have all that is laudable. This Affectation is what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the familiar Man into Pretences to take State upon him, and the contrary Character to the Folly of aiming at being winning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant. But in theſe Caſes, Men may eaſily lay aſide what they are, but can never arrive at what they are not.</p>
               <p>As to the Purſuits after Affection and Eſteem, the Fair Sex are happy in this Particular, that with them the one is much more nearly related to the other than in Men. The Love of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is inſeparable from ſome Eſteem of her; and as ſhe is naturally the Object of Affection, the Woman who has your Eſteem has alſo ſome Degree of your Love. A Man that dotes on a Woman for her Beauty, will whiſper his Friend, <hi>That Creature has a great deal of Wit when you are well acquainted with her.</hi> And if you examine the Bottom of your Eſteem for a Woman, you will find you have a greater Opinion of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than any Body elſe. As to us Men, I deſign to paſs moſt of my Time with the facetious <hi>Harry Bickerſtaff;</hi> but <hi>William Bickerſtaff,</hi> the moſt prudent Man of our Family, ſhall be my Executor.</p>

               <p>HAving Yeſterday Morning received a Paper of <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes, written with much Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in Honour of theſe my Papers, and being informed at the ſame Time that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a Youth under Age, I read them with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0397200204:89"/>
much Delight, as an Inſtance of his Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is not a greater Pleaſure to old Age, than ſeeing young People entertain themſelves in ſuch a Manner as that we can partake of their Enjoyments. On ſuch Occaſions we flatter our ſelves, that we are not quite laid aſide in the World, but that we are either uſed with Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for what we were, or honoured for what we are. A well inclined young Man, and whoſe good Breeding is founded upon the Principles of Nature and Virtue, muſt needs take Delight in being agreeable to his Elders, as we are truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted when we are not the Jeſt of them. When I ſay this, I muſt confeſs I cannot but think it a very lamentable Thing that there ſhould be a Neceſſity for making that a Rule of Life, which ſhould be, methinks, a meer Inſtinct of Nature. If Reflection upon a Man in Poverty, whom we once knew in Riches, is an Argument of Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration with generous Minds; ſure old Age, which is a Decay from that Vigour which the Young poſſeſs, and muſt certainly (if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented againſt their Will) arrive at, ſhould be more forcibly the Object of that Reverence which honeſt Spirits are inclined to from a Senſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves liable to what they obſerve has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready overtaken others.</p>
               <p>My Three Nephews, whom in <hi>June</hi> laſt was Twelvemonth I diſpoſed of according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Capacities and Inclinations, the firſt to the Univerſity, the Second to a Merchant, and the Third to a Woman of Quality as her Page, by my Invitation dined with me to Day. It is my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom often, when I have a Mind to give my ſelf a more than ordinary Chearfulneſs, to invite a certain young Gentlewoman of our Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to make one of the Company. She did me that Favour this Day. The Preſence of a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woman of Honour, to Minds which are not trivially diſpoſed, diſplays an Alacrity which is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0397200204:90"/>
not to be communicated by any other Object. It was not unpleaſant to me to look into her Thoughts of the Company ſhe was in. She ſmiled at the Party of Pleaſure I had thought of for her, which was compoſed of an old Man and Three Boys. My Scholar, my Citizen, and my ſelf, were very ſoon neglected; and the young Courtier, by the Bow he made to her at her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, engaged her Obſervation without a Rival. I obſerved the <hi>Oxonian</hi> not a little diſcompoſed at this Preference, while the Trader kept his Eye upon his Unkle. My Nephew <hi>Will</hi> had a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſecret Reſolutions to break in upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his younger Brother, who gave my fair Companion a full Account of the Faſhion, and what was reckoned moſt becoming to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and what Sort of Habit appeared beſt upon t'other Shape. He proceeded to acquaint her, who of Quality was well or ſick within the Bills of Mortality, and named very familiarly all his Lady's Acquaintance, not forgetting her very Words when he ſpoke of their Characters. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, he had a Road of Flattery; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her enquiring what Sort of Woman Lady <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> was in her Perſon, Really Madam, ſays the Jackanapes, ſhe is exactly of your Height and Shape; but as you are fair, ſhe is a brown Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. There was no enduring that this Fop ſhould outſhine us all at this unmerciful Rate, therefore I thought fit to talk to my young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concerning his Studies; and becauſe I would throw his Learning into preſent Service, I deſired him to repeat to me the Tranſlation he had made of ſome tender Verſes in <hi>Theocritus.</hi> He did ſo, with an Air of Elegance peculiar to the College to which I ſent him. I made ſome Exceptions to the Turn of the Phraſes, which he defended with much Modeſty, as believing in that Place the Matter was rather to conſult the Softneſs of a Swain's Paſſion, than the Strength of his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0397200204:91"/>
It ſoon appeared, that <hi>Will</hi> had out-ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his Brother in the Opinion of our young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. A little Poetry to one who is bred a Scholar, has the ſame Effect that a good Carriage of his Perſon has on one who is to live in Courts. The Favour of Women is ſo natural a Paſſion, that I envied both the Boys their Succeſs in the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of my Gueſt; and I thought the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon invulnerable was my young Trader. During the whole Meal, I could obſerve in the Children a mutual Contempt and Scorn of each other, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from their different Way of Life and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and took that Occaſion to advertiſe them of ſuch growing Diſtaſts, which might miſlead them in their future Life, and diſappoint their Friends, as well as themſelves, of the Advantages which might be expected from the Diverſity of their Profeſſions and Intereſts.</p>
               <p>The Prejudices which are growing up between theſe Brothers from the different Ways of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are what create the moſt fatal Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in Life. But all Diſtinctions of Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement meerly from our Circumſtances, are ſuch as will not bear the Examination of Reaſon. The Courtier, the Trader, and the Scholar, ſhould all have an equal Pretenſion to the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a Gentleman. That Tradeſman who deals with me in a Commodity which I do not underſtand with Uprightneſs, has much more Right to that Character, than the Courtier who gives me falſe Hopes, or the Scholar who laughs at my Ignorance.</p>
               <p>The Appellation of Gentleman is never to be affixed to a Man's Circumſtances, but to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in them. For this Reaſon I ſhall ever, as far as I am able, give my Nephews ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as ſhall make them value themſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they are uſeful to others, than as they are conſcious of Merit in themſelves. There are no Qualities from which we ought to pretend to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0397200204:92"/>
Eſteem of others, but ſuch as render us ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them; for <hi>Free Men have no Superiors but Benefactors.</hi> I was going on like a true old Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to this Purpoſe to my Gueſts, when I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the following Epiſtle:</p>

               <p>AN old Acquaintanc who met me this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeemed overjoyed to ſee me, and told me, I looked as well as he had known me do theſe Forty Years: But, continued he, not quite the Man you were when we viſited together at Lady <hi>Brightly</hi>'s. Oh! <hi>Iſaac,</hi> thoſe Days are over. Do you think there are any ſuch fine Creatures now living as we then converſed with? He went on with a Thouſand incoherent Circumſtances, which, in his Imagination, muſt needs pleaſe me; but they had the quite contrary Effect. The Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with which he began, in telling me how well I wore, was not diſagreeable; but his indiſcreet Mention of a Set of Acquaintance we had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived, recalled Ten Thouſand Things to my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which made me reflect upon my preſent Condition with Regret. Had he indeed been ſo kind as, after a long Abſence, to felicitate me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an indolent and eaſy old Age, and mentioned how much he and I had to thank for, who at our Time of Day could walk firmly, eat heartily, and converſe chearfully, he had kept up my Pleaſure in my ſelf. But of all Mankind, there are none ſo ſhocking as theſe injudicious civil People. They ordinarily begin upon ſomething that they know muſt be a Satisfaction; but then, for Fear of the Imputation of Flattery, they follow it with the laſt Thing in the World of which you would be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0397200204:94"/>
reminded. It is this that perplexes civil Perſons. The Reaſon that there is ſuch a general Outcry amongſt us againſt Flatterers, is, that there are ſo very few good Ones. It is the niceſt Art in this Life, and is a Part of Eloquence which does not want the Preparation that is neceſſary to all other Parts of it, That your Audience ſhould be your Well-wiſhers: For Praiſe from an Enemy is the moſt pleaſing of all Commendations.</p>
               <p>It is generally to be obſerved, that the Perſon moſt agreeable to a Man for a Conſtancy is he that has no ſhining Qualities, but is a certain Degree above great Imperfections, whom he can live with as his Inferior, and who will either overlook or not obſerve his little Defects. Such an eaſy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion as this, either now and then throws out a little Flattery, or lets a Man ſilently flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Superiority to him. If you take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, there is hardly a rich Man in the World, who has not ſuch a led Friend of ſmall Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is a Darling for his Inſignificancy. It is a great Eaſe to have one in our own Shape a Species below us, and who, without being liſted in our Service, is by Nature of our Retinue. Theſe Dependants are of excellent Uſe on a Rainy Day, or when a Man has not a Mind to dreſs, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Solitude, when one has neither a Mind to that or to Company. There are of this good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Order, who are ſo kind as to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do theſe good Offices to many. Five or Six of them viſit a whole Quarter of the Town, and exclude the Spleen without Fees from the Families they frequent. If they do not preſcribe Phyſick, they can be Company when you take it. Very great Benefactors to the Rich, or thoſe whom they call People at their Eaſe, are your Perſons of no Conſequence. I have known ſome of them, by the Help of a little Cunning, make delicious Flatterers. They know the Courſe of the Town, and the general Characters of Perſons: By this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0397200204:95"/>
Means they will ſometimes tell the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Falſhoods imaginable. They will acquaint you, that ſuch a One of a quite contrary Party ſaid, that tho' you were engaged in different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, yet he had the greateſt Reſpect for your good Senſe and Addreſs. When one of theſe has a little Cunning, he paſſes his Time in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Satisfaction to himſelf and his Friends: For his Poſition is never to report or ſpeak a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Thing to his Friend. As for letting him go on in an Error, he knows Advice againſt them is the Office of Perſons of greater Talents and leſs Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latin</hi> Word for a Flatterer <hi>(Aſſentator)</hi> implies no more than a Perſon that barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; and indeed ſuch a one, if a Man were able to purchaſe or maintain him, cannot be bought too dear. Such a one never contradicts you, but gains upon you, not by a fulſom Way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending you in broad Terms, but liking what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you propoſe or utter; at the ſame Time is ready to beg your Pardon, and gainſay you, if you chance to ſpeak Ill of your ſelf. An old Lady is very ſeldom without ſuch a Companion as this, who can recite the Names of all her Lovers, and the Matches refuſed by her in the Days when ſhe minded ſuch Vanities, (as ſhe is pleaſed to call them, tho' ſhe ſo much approves the Mention of them.) It is to be noted, that a Woman's Flatterer is generally older than her ſelf, her Years ſerving at once to recommend her Patroneſs's Age, and to add Weight to her Complaiſance in all other Particulars.</p>
               <p>We Gentlemen of ſmall Fortunes are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſitous in this Particular. I have indeed one who ſmokes with me often; but his Parts are ſo low, that all the Incenſe he does me is to fill his Pipe with me, and to be out at juſt as many Whiffs as I take. This is all the Praiſe or Aſſent that he is capable of, yet there are more Hours when I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0397200204:96"/>
would rather be in his Company than that of the brighteſt Man I know. It would be an hard Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give an Account of this Inclination to be flattered; but if we go to the Bottom of it, we ſhall find that the Pleaſure in it is ſomething like that of receiving Money which lay out. Every Man thinks he has an Eſtate of Reputation, and is glad to ſee one that will bring any of it Home to him: It is no Matter how dirty a Bag it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to him in, or by how clowniſh a Meſſenger, ſo the Money is good. All that we want to be pleaſed with Flattery, is to believe that the Man is ſincere who gives it us. It is by this one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, that abſurd Creatures often outrun the more Skilful in this Art. Their Want of Ability is here an Advantage, and their Bluntneſs, as it is the ſeeming Effect of Sincerity, is the beſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Artifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terence</hi> introduces a Flatterer talking to a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb whom he cheats out of a Livelihood, and a third Perſon on the Stage makes on him this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Remark, <q rend="inline">"This Fellow has an Art of making Fools Madmen."</q> The Love of Flattery is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes the Weakneſs of a great Mind; but you ſee it alſo in Perſons who otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover no Manner of Reliſh of any Thing above meer Senſuality. Theſe latter it ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, but always debaſes the former. A Fool is in himſelf the Object of Pity till he is flattered. By the Force of that his Stupidity is raiſed into Affectation, and he becomes of Dignity enough to be ridiculous. I remember a Drole, that upon one's ſaying, The Times are ſo tickliſh that there muſt great Care be taken what one ſays in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; anſwered with an Air of Surlineſs and Honeſty, If People will be free, let them be ſo in the Manner that I am, who never abuſe a Man but to his Face. He had no Reputation for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous Truths; therefore when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, You abuſe a Man but to his Face? Yes, ſays he, I flatter him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0397200204:97"/>
It is indeed the greateſt of Injuries to flatter any but the Unhappy, or ſuch as are diſpleaſed with themſelves for ſome Infirmity. In this latter Caſe we have a Member of our Club, that when Sir <hi>Jeffery</hi> falls aſleep, wakens him with Snoring. This makes Sir <hi>Jeffery</hi> hold up for ſome Moments the longer, to ſee there are Men younger than himſelf among us, who are more Lethargick than he is.</p>
               <p>When Flattery is practiſed upon any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, it is the moſt abject Thing in Nature; nay, I cannot think of any Character below the Flatterer, except he that envies him. You meet with Fellows prepared to be as mean as poſſible in their Condeſcentions and Expreſſions; but they want Perſons and Talents to riſe up to ſuch a Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As a Coxcomb is a Fool of Parts, ſo is a Flatterer a Knave of Parts.</p>
               <p>The beſt of this Order that I know, is one who diſguiſes it under a Spirit of Contradiction or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. He told an errant Driveler the other Day, That he did not care for being in Company with him, becauſe he heard he turned his abſent Friends into Ridicule. And upon Lady <hi>Autumn</hi>'s diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him about ſomething that happened at the Revolution, he replied with a very angry Tone, Pray, Madam, give me Leave to know more of a Thing in which I was actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, than you who were then in your Nurſe's Arms.</p>

               <p>ANoble Painter, who has an Ambition to draw an Hiſtory-Piece, has deſired of me to give him a Subject on which he may ſhow the utmoſt Force of his Art and Genius. For this Purpoſe I have pitched upon that remarkable Incident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> and his Phyſician. This Prince, in the Midſt of his Conqueſts in <hi>Perſia,</hi> was ſeized by a violent Fever; and according to the Account we have of his <hi>vaſt</hi> Mind, his Thoughts were more employed about his Recovery as it regarded the War, than as it concerned his own Life. He profeſſed, a ſlow Method was worſe than Death to him, becauſe it was what he more dreaded, an Interruption of his Glory. He deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a dangerous, ſo it might be a ſpeedy Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. During this Impatience of the King, it is well known that <hi>Darius</hi> had offered an immenſe Sum to any who ſhould take away his Life. But <hi>Philippus,</hi> the moſt eſteemed and moſt knowing of his Phyſicians, promiſed, that within Three Days Time he would prepare a Medicine for him which ſhould reſtore him more expeditiouſly than could be imagined. Immediately after this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, <hi>Alexander</hi> receives a Letter from the moſt conſiderable of his Captains, with Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, That <hi>Darius</hi> had bribed <hi>Philippus</hi> to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon him. Every Circumſtance imaginable favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this Suſpicion; but this Monarch, who did nothing but in an extraordinary Manner, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Letter; and while the Medicine was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, ſpent all his Thoughts upon his Behaviour
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0397200204:99"/>
in this important Incident. From his long Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy he came to this Reſolution: <q rend="inline">"<hi>Alexander</hi> muſt not lie here alive to be oppreſſed by his Enemy. I will not believe my Phyſician guilty; or, I will periſh rather by his Guilt, than my own Diffidence.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the appointed Hour, <hi>Philippus</hi> enters with the Potion. One cannot but form to one's ſelf on Occaſion the Encounter of their Eyes, the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe of the Patient, and the Benevolence in the Countenance of the Phyſician. The Hero raiſed himſelf in his Bed, and holding the Letter in one Hand, and the Potion in the other, drank the Medicine. It will exerciſe my Friend's Pencil and Brain to place this Action in its proper Beauty. A Prince obſerving the Features of a ſuſpected Traytor after having drank the Poiſon he offer'd him, is a Circumſtance ſo full of Paſſion, that it will require the higheſt Strength of his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conceive it, much more to expreſs it. But as Painting is Eloquence and Poetry in Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, I ſhall raiſe his Idea's, by reading with him the fineſt Draughts of the Paſſions concerned in this Circumſtance from the moſt excellent Poets and Orators. The Confidence which <hi>Alexander</hi> aſſumes from the Air of <hi>Philippus</hi>'s Face as he is reading his Accuſation, and the generous Diſdain which is to riſe in the Features of a falſly accuſed Man, are principally to be regarded. In this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he muſt heighten his Thoughts, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he is not drawing only an innocent Man traduced, but a Man zealouſly affected to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Safety, full of Reſentment for being thought falſe. How ſhall we contrive to expreſs the higheſt Admiration mingled with Diſdain? How ſhall we in Strokes of a Pencil ſay, what <hi>Philippus</hi> did to his Prince on this Occaſion? <q rend="inline">"Sir, my Life never depended on yours more than it does now. Without knowing this Secret, I prepared the Potion, which you have taken as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0397200204:100"/>
what concerned <hi>Philippus</hi> no leſs than <hi>Alexander;</hi> and there is nothing new in this Adventure, but that it makes me ſtill more admire the Generoſity and Confidence of my Maſter."</q> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> took him by the Hand, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Philippus,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you had rather I had any other Way to have manifeſted the Faith I have in you, than a Caſe which ſo nearly concerns me: And in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I now aſſure you, I am anxious for the Effect of your Medicine, more for your Sake than my own.'</q>

               <p>My Painter is employed by a Man of Senſe and Wealth to furniſh him a Gallery, and I ſhall join with my Friend in the Deſigning Part. It is the great Uſe of Pictures to raiſe in our Minds either agreeable Idea's of our abſent Friends, or high Images of eminent Perſonages. But the latter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is, methinks, carried on in a very improper Way: For to fill a Room full of Battle-Pieces, pompous Hiſtories of Sieges, and a tall Hero a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in a Crowd of inſignificant Figures about him, is of no Conſequence to private Men. But to place before our Eyes great and illuſtrious Men in thoſe Parts and Circumſtances of Life wherein their Behaviour may have an Effect upon our Minds, as being ſuch as we partake with them merely as they were Men: Such as theſe, I ſay, may be juſt and uſeful Ornaments of an elegant Apartment. In this Collection therefore that we are making, we will not have the Battles, but the Sentiments of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The Affair we were juſt now talking of, has Circumſtances of the higheſt Nature, and yet their Grandeur has little to do with his Fortune. If by obſerving ſuch a Piece as that of his taking a Bowl of Poiſon with ſo much Magnanimity, a Man, the next Time he has a Fit of the Spleen, is leſs froward to his Friend or his Servants; thus far is ſome Improvement.</p>

I have frequently thought, that if we had many Draughts which were Hiſtorical of certain Paſſions, and had the true Figure of the great Men we ſee tranſported by them, it would be of the moſt ſolid Advantage imaginable. To conſider this mighty Man on one Occaſion adminiſter to the Wants of a poor Soldier, benummed with Cold, with the greateſt Humanity; at another, barbarouſly ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a faithful Officer: At one Time, ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly chaſt and virtuous as to give his Captive <hi>Statira</hi> her Liberty; at another, burning a Town at the Inſtigation of <hi>Thais.</hi> This Sort of Changes in the ſame Perſon are what would be more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Leſſons of Morality, than the ſeveral Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in a great Man's Fortune. There are but One or Two in an Age to whom the pompous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of his Life can be exemplary; but I or any Man may be as ſick, as good-natur'd, as compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and as angry, as <hi>Alexander the great.</hi> My Purpoſe in all this Chat is, that ſo excellent a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture may not for the future have ſo Romantick a Turn, but allude to Incidents which come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Fortunes of the ordinary Race of Men. I do not know but 'tis by the Force of this ſenſeleſs Cuſtom that People are drawn in Poſtures they would not for half they are worth be ſurpriſed in. The unparallell'd Firceneſs of ſome Rural 'Squires drawn in Red, or in Armour, who never dreamed to deſtroy any Thing above a Fox, is a common and ordinary Offence of this Kind.

               <p>I Did my ſelf the Honour this Day to make a Viſit to a Lady of Quality, who is one of thoſe who are ever railing at the Vices of the Age, but mean only one Vice, becauſe it is the only Vice they are not guilty of. She went ſo far as to fall foul on a young Woman who has had Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but whether they were juſt or not, no one knows but her ſelf. However that is, ſhe is in her preſent Behaviour modeſt, humble, pious, and diſcreet. I thought it became me to bring this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Lady to Reaſon, and let her ſee ſhe was a much more vitious Woman than the Perſon ſhe ſpoke of.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid I, you are very ſevere to this poor young Woman, for a Treſpaſs which I believe Heaven has forgiven her, and for which you ſee ſhe is for ever out of Countenance. Nay, Mr. <hi>Bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſtaff,</hi> ſhe interrupted, If you at this Time of Day contradict People of Virtue, and ſtand up for ill Women—No, no, Madam, ſaid I, not ſo faſt, ſhe is reclaimed, and I fear you never will be. Nay, nay, Madam, do not be in a Paſſion, but let me tell you what you are. You are indeed as good as your Neighbours, but that is being very bad. You are a Woman at the Head of a Family, and lead a perfect Town Lady's Life. You go on your own Way, and conſult nothing but your Glaſs. What Imperfections indeed you ſee there, you immediately mend as faſt as you can. You may do the ſame by the Faults I tell you of, for they are much more in your Power to correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0397200204:103"/>
You are to know then, that you Viſiting Ladies, that carry your Virtue from Houſe to Houſe with ſo much Prattle in each other's Applauſe, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over other People's Faults, I grant you have but the Speculation of Vice in your own Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, but, promote the Practice of it in all others you have to do with.</p>
               <p>As for you, Madam, your Time paſſes away in Dreſſing, Eating, Sleeping, and Praying. When you riſe in Morning, I grant you an Hour ſpent very well; but you come out to dreſs in ſo fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Humour, that the poor Girl who attends you, curſes her very Being in that ſhe is your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for the peeviſh Things you ſay to her. When this poor Creature is put into a Way, that Good or Evil are regarded but as they relieve her from the Hours ſhe has and muſt paſs with you. The next you have to do with, is your Coachman and Footmen. They convey your Ladyſhip to Church. While you are praying there, they are curſing, ſwearing, and drinking in an Ale-houſe. During the Time alſo which your Ladyſhip ſets apart for Heaven, you are to know, that your Cook is ſweating and fretting in Preparation for your Dinner. Soon after your Meal you make Viſits, and the whole World that belongs to you ſpeaks all the Ill of you which you are repeating of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. You ſee, Madam, whatever Way you go, all about you are in a very broad one. The Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of theſe People it is your proper Buſineſs to enquire into; and till you reform them, you had beſt let your Equals alone; otherwiſe, if I allow you you are not vitious, you muſt allow me you are not virtuous.</p>

               <p>I muſt defer my Anſwer to this Lady out of a Point of Chronology. She ſays, ſhe has been Twenty Seven Years a Maid; but I fear, according to a common Error, ſhe dates her Virginity from her Birth, which is a very erroneous Method; for a Woman of Twenty is no more to be thought chaſt ſo many Years, than a Man of that Age can be ſaid to have been ſo long Valiant. We muſt not allow People the Favour of a Virtue till they have been under the Temptation to the contrary. A Woman is not a Maid till her Birth-Day, as we call it, of her Fifteenth Year. My Plaintiff is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired to inform me, whether ſhe is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in her Twenty eighth or Forty third Year, and ſhe ſhall be diſpatched accordingly.</p>

Expedition. The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſoon had Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their Motion, and took a Reſolution to decamp, in order to intercept them, within a Day's March of our Army. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive the Enemy might make ſuch a Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and commanded General <hi>Stanhope</hi> with a Body of Horſe, conſiſting of Fourteen Squadrons, to obſerve their Courſe, and prevent their Paſſage over the Rivers <hi>Segra</hi> and <hi>Noguera</hi> between <hi>Larida</hi> and <hi>Balaguer.</hi> It happened to be the firſt Day that Officer had appeared Abroad after a dangerous and violent Fever; but he received the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on this Occaſion with a Joy which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted his preſent Weakneſs, and on the 27th of laſt Month came up with the Enemy on the Plains of <hi>Balaguer.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Rear-Guard conſiſting of Twenty ſix Squadrons, that General ſent Intelligence of their Poſture to the King, and deſired his Majeſty's Orders to attack them. During the Time which he waited for his Inſtructions, he made his Diſpoſition for the Charge, which was to divide themſelves into Three Bodies; One to be commanded by himſelf in the Center, a Body on the Right by Count <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and the Third on the Left by the Earl of <hi>Rochford.</hi> Upon the Receipt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Direction to attack the Enemy, the General himſelf charged with the utmoſt Vigour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, while the Earl of <hi>Rochford</hi> and Count <hi>Maurice</hi> extended themſelves on his Right and Left, to prevent the Advantage the Enemy might make of the Superiority of their Numbers. What appears to have miſled the Enemy's General in this Affair was, that it was not ſuppoſed practicable that the Confederates would attack him till they had received a Reinforcement. For this Reaſon he purſued his March without facing about, till we were actually coming on to Engagement. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Stanhope</hi>'s Diſpoſition made it impracticable to do it at that Time, Count <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Earl
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0397200204:106"/>
of <hi>Rochford</hi> attacking them in the Inſtant in which they were forming themſelves. The Charge was made with the greateſt Gallantry, and the Enemy very ſoon put into ſo great Diſorder, that their whole Cavalry were commanded to ſupport their Rear-Guard.

               <p>IF there were no other Conſequence of it, but barely that Humane Creatures on this Day aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves before their Creator, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Regard to their uſual Employments, their Minds at Leiſure from the Cares of this Life, and their Bodies adorned with the beſt Attire they can beſtow on them; I ſay, were this meer outward Celebration of a Sabbath all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Men, even that were a laudable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and a Purpoſe worthy the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But when there is added to it the ſublime Pleaſure of Devotion, our Being is exalted above it ſelf; and he who ſpends a Seventh Day in the Contemplation of the next Life, will not eaſily fall into the Corruptions of this in the other Six. They who never admit Thoughts of this Kind into their Imagination, loſe higher and ſweeter Satisfactions than can be raiſed by any other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. The moſt illiterate Man who is touched with Devotion, and uſes frequent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of it, contracts a certain Greatneſs of Mind, mingled with a noble Simplicity, that raiſes him above thoſe of the ſame Condition; and there is an indelible Mark of Goodneſs in thoſe who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely poſſeſs it. It is hardly poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe; for the Fervours of a pious Mind will naturally contract ſuch an Earneſtneſs and Attention towards a better Being, as will make
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0397200204:108"/>
the ordinary Paſſages of Life go off with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Indifference. By this, a Man in the loweſt Condition will not appear mean, or in the moſt ſplendid Fortune, inſolent.</p>
               <p>As to all the Intricacies and Viciſſitudes under which Men are ordinarily intangled with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Sorrow and Paſſion, one who is devoted to Heaven when he falls into ſuch Difficulties is led by a Clue through a Labyrinth. As to this World, he does not pretend to Skill in the Mazes of it, but fixes his Thoughts upon one Certainty, that he ſhall ſoon be out of it. And we may ask very boldly, What can be a more ſure Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than to have an Hope in Death? When Men are arrived at thinking of their very Diſſolution with Pleaſure, how few Things are there that can be terrible to them? Certainly nothing can be dreadful to ſuch Spirits, but what would make Death terrible to them, Falſhood towards Man, or Impiety towards Heaven. To ſuch as theſe, as there are certainly many ſuch, the Gratifications of innocent Pleaſures are doubled, even with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon their Imperfection. The Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments which naturally attend the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes we make our ſelves in expected Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſtrike no Damp upon ſuch Men, but only quicken their Hopes of ſoon knowing Joys, which are too pure to admit of Allay or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety.</p>
               <p>It is thought among the politer Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind an Imperfection to want a Reliſh of any of thoſe Things which refine our Lives. This is the Foundation of the Acceptance which Eloquence, Muſick, and Poetry, make in the World; and I know not why Devotion, conſidered meerly as an Exaltation of our Happineſs, ſhould not at leaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be ſo far regarded as to be conſidered. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſible the very Enquiry would lead Men into ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Acquaintance has been loſt from a general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion in his Disfavour, and a ſevere Aſpect has often hid under it a very agreeable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>There are no diſtinguiſhing Qualities among Men to which there are not falſe Pretenders; but tho' none is more pretended to than that of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, there are, perhaps, fewer ſucceſsful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors in this Kind than any other. There is ſomething ſo natively great and good in a Perſon that is truly devout, that an aukward Man may as well pretend to be genteel, as an Hypocrite to be pious. The Conſtraint in Words and Actions are equally viſible in both Caſes, and any Thing ſet up in their Room does but remove the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavourers the further off their Pretenſions. But however the Senſe of true Piety is abated, there is no other Motive of Action that can carry us through all the Viciſſitudes of Life with Alacrity and Reſolution. But Piety, like Philoſophy, when it is ſuperficial, does but make Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the worſe for it; and a Principle that is but half received, does but diſtract, inſtead of gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Behaviour. When I reflect upon the unequal Conduct of <hi>Lotius,</hi> I ſee many Things that run directly counter to his Intereſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot attribute his Labours for the publick Good to Ambition. When I conſider his Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Fortune, I cannot eſteem him cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. How then can I reconcile his Neglect of himſelf, and his Zeal for others? I have long ſuſpected him to be <hi>a little Pious:</hi> But no Man ever hid his Vice with greater Caution than he does his Virtue. It was the Praiſe of a great <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> That he had rather be, than appear good. But ſuch is the Weakneſs of <hi>Lotius,</hi> that I dare ſay, he had rather be eſteemed irreligious, than devout. By I know not what Impatience of Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

are made uſe of to hide a Time of private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he will allow you any Suſpicion of his being ill employed, ſo you do not tax him with being well. But alas! How mean is ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour? To boaſt of Virtue is a moſt ridiculous Way of diſappointing the Merit of it, but not ſo pitiful as that of being aſhamed of it. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy is the Wretch who makes the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and independent Motive of Action the Cauſe of Perplexity and Inconſtancy? How much ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Figure does <hi>Caelicola</hi> make with all who know him? His great and ſuperior Mind, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exalted by the Raptures of Heavenly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, is to all his Friends of the ſame Uſe as if an Angel were to appear at the Deciſion of their Diſputes. They very well underſtand he is as much diſintereſted and unbiaſs'd as ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He conſiders all Applications made to him, as thoſe Addreſſes will effect his own Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Heaven. All his Determinations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd with a beautiful Humility; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces his Deciſions with the Air of one who is more frequently a Supplicant than a Judge.</p>
               <p>Thus humble, and thus great, is the Man who is moved by Piety, and exalted by Devotion. But behold this recommended by the maſterly Hand of a great Divine I have heretofore made bold with.</p>
               <q>It is ſuch a Pleaſure as can never cloy or overwork the Mind; a Delight that grows and improves under Thought and Reflection; and while it exerciſes, does alſo endear it ſelf to the Mind. All Pleaſure that affect the Body muſt needs weary, becauſe they tranſport; and all Tranſportation is a Violence; and no Violence can be laſting, but determines upon the Falling of the Spirits, which are not able to keep up that Height of Motion that the Plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure of the Senſes raiſes them to. And there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore how inevitably does an immoderate Laugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0397200204:111"/>
end in a Sigh, which is only Nature's reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it ſelf after a Force done to it: But the religious Pleaſure of a well-diſpoſed Mind moves gently, and therefore conſtantly. It does not effect by Rapture and Extaſie, but is like the Pleaſure of Health, greater and ſtronger than thoſe that call up the Senſes with groſſer and more affecting Impreſſions. No Man's Body is as ſtrong as his Appetites; but Heaven has cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Boundleſneſs of his voluptuous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by ſtinting his Strengths, and contracting his Capacities.—The Pleaſure of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Man is an eaſy and a portable Pleaſure, ſuch an one as he carries about in his Boſom, without alarming either the Eye or Envy of the World. A Man putting all his Pleaſure into this one, is like a Traveller putting all his Goods into one Jewel; the Value is the ſame, and the Convenience greater.</q>

               <p>I think the Lady's Brother has given us a very good Idea of that elegant Expreſſion, it being the greateſt Beauty of Speech to be cloſe and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. To this End nothing is to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſulted than Plainneſs. In a Lady's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire this is the ſingle Excellence; for to be what ſome call fine, is the ſame Vice in that Caſe, as to be florid is in Writing or Speaking. I have ſtudied and writ on this important Subject till I almoſt deſpair of making a Reformation in the Females of this Iſland, where we have more Beauty than in any Spot in the Univerſe, if we did not diſguiſe it by falſe Garniture, and detract from it by impertinent Improvements. I have by me a Treatiſe concerning Pinners, which I have ſome Hopes will contribute to the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent Head-dreſſes, to which I have ſolid and unanſwerable Objections. But moſt of the Errors in that and other Particulars of adorning the Head, are crept into the World from the Ignorance of modern Tirewomen; for it is come to that Paſs, that an aukward Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the firſt Year of her Apprenticeſhip, that can hardly ſtick a Pin, ſhall take upon her to dreſs a Woman of the Firſt Quality. However it is certain, that there requires in a good Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman a perfect Skill in Opticks; for all the Force of Ornament is to contribute to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eyes. Thus ſhe who has a Mind to look killing, muſt arm her Face accordingly, and not leave her Eyes and Cheeks undreſſed. Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

will ſee even her own Husband without a Hood on. Can any one living bear to ſee Miſs <hi>Gruel,</hi> lean as ſhe is, with her Hair tied back after the modern Way? But ſuch is the Folly of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that becauſe one who is a Beauty, out of Oſtentation of her being ſuch, takes Care to wear ſomething that ſhe knows cannot be of any Conſequence to her Complexion; I ſay, our Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men run on ſo heedleſly in the Faſhion, that tho' it is the Intereſt of ſome to hide as much of their Faces as poſſible, yet becauſe a leading Toaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with a backward Head-dreſs, the reſt ſhall follow the Mode, without obſerving that the Author of the Faſhion aſſumed it becauſe it could become no one but her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flavia</hi> is ever well dreſſed, and always the gentileſt Woman you meet: But the Make of her Mind very much contributes to the Ornament of her Body. She has the greateſt Simplicity of Manners of any of her Sex. This makes every Thing look native about her, and her Cloaths are ſo exactly fitted, that they appear as it were Part of her Perſon. Every one that ſees her, knows her to be of Quality; but her Diſtinction is owing to her Manner, and not to her Habit. Her Beauty is full of Attraction, but not of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement. There is ſuch a Compoſure in her Looks, and Propriety in her Dreſs, that you would think it impoſſible ſhe ſhould change the Garb you one Day ſee her in for any Thing ſo becoming, till you next Day ſee her in another. There is no other Myſtery in this, but that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe is apparelled, ſhe is her ſelf the ſame: For there is ſo immediate a Relation between our Thoughts and Geſtures, that a Woman muſt think well to look well.</p>
               <p>But this weighty Subject I muſt put off for ſome other Matters in which my Correſpondents are urgent for Anſwers, which I ſhall do where I

               <p>THere has of late crept in among the downright <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a mighty Spirit of Diſſimulation. But before we diſcourſe of this Vice, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that the Learned make a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Simulation and Diſſimulation. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation is a Pretence of what is not, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation a Concealment of what is. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0397200204:116"/>
is our preſent Affair. When you look round you in publick Places in this Iſland, you ſee the Generality of Mankind carry in their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance an Air of Challenge or Defiance: And there is no ſuch Man to be found among us who naturally ſtrives to do greater Honours and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities than he receives. This innate Sullenneſs or Stubborneſs of Complexion is hardly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by any of our Iſlanders. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, however they may pretend to chooſe one another, they make but very aukward Rogues; and their Diſlike to each other is ſeldom ſo well diſſembled, but it is ſuſpected. When once it is ſo, it had as good be profeſſed. A Man who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles well, muſt have none of what we call Stomach, otherwiſe he will be cold in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Good-Will where he hates; an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the laſt ill Conſequence in Buſineſs. This Fierceneſs in our Natures is apparent from the Conduct of our young Fellows, who are not got into the Schemes and Arts of Life which the Children of this World walk by. One would think that of Courſe, when a Man of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for his Figure, his Mien, or his Gravity, paſſes by a Youth, he ſhould certainly have the firſt Advances of Salutation; but he is, you may obſerve, treated in a quite different Manner, it being the very Characteriſtick of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Temper to defy. As I am an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> I find it a very hard Matter to bring my ſelf to pull off the Hat firſt; but it is the only Way to be upon any good Terms with thoſe we meet with: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Advance is of high Moment. Men judge of others by themſelves; and he that will command with us, muſt condeſcend. It moves ones Spleen very agreeably to ſee Fellows pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Diſſemblers without this Leſſon. They are ſo reſervedly complaiſant till they have learn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to reſign their natural Paſſions, that all the Steps they make towards gaining thoſe whom
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0397200204:117"/>
they would be well with, are but ſo many Marks of what they really are, and not of what they would appear.</p>
               <p>The rough <hi>Britains,</hi> when they pretend to be artful towards one another, are ridiculous enough; but when they ſet up for Vices they have not, and diſſemble their Good with an Affectation of Ill, they are inſupportable. I know Two Men in this Town who make as good Figures as any in it, that manage their Credit ſo well as to be thought Atheiſts, and yet ſay their Prayers Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening. <hi>Tom. Springly</hi> t'other Day pretended to go to an Aſſignation with a married Woman at <hi>Roſamond</hi>'s-<hi>Pond,</hi> and was ſeen ſoon after reading the Reſponſes with great Gravity at Six of Clock Prayers.</p>

                     <p>I Have lately read your Paper, wherein you repreſent a Converſation between a young Lady, your Three Nephews, and your ſelf; and am not a little offended at the Figure you give your young Merchant in the Preſence of a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Topick of Love is a Subject on which a Man is more beholden to Nature for his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than to the Inſtruction of the Schools, or my Lady's Woman. From the Two latter, your Scholar and Page muſt have reaped all their Advantage above him—I know by this Time you have pronounced me a Trader. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, but cannot bear the Excluſion from any Pretence of ſpeaking agreeably to a Fine Woman, or from any Degree of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that Way. You have among us Citizens

many Well-wiſhers, but it is for the Juſtice of your Repreſentations, which we, perhaps, are better Judges of than you (by the Account you give of your Nephew) ſeem to allow.</p>
                     <p>To give you an Opportunity of making us ſome Reparation, I deſire you would tell your own Way the following Inſtance of Heroick Love in the City. You are to remember, that ſomewhere in your Writings, for enlarging the Territories of Virtue and Honour, you have multiplied the Opportunities of attaining to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Virtue, and have hinted, that in whatever State of Life a Man is, if he does Things above what is ordinarily performed by Men of his Rank, he is in thoſe Inſtances an Hero.</p>

                        <hi>Tom Trueman,</hi> a young Gentleman of Eighteen Years of Age, fell paſſionately in Love with the beauteous <hi>Almira,</hi> Daughter to his Maſter. Her Regard for him was no leſs tender. <hi>True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was better acquainted with his Maſter's Affairs than his Daughter, and ſecretly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that each Day brought him by many Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages nearer Bankrupcy than the former. This unhappy Poſture of their Affairs the Youth ſuſpected was owing to the ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Factor, in whom his Maſter had an entire Confidence. <hi>Trueman</hi> took a proper Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, when his Maſter was ruminating on his decaying Fortune, to addreſs him for Leave to ſpend the Remainder of his Time with his Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Correſpondent. During Three Years Stay in that Employment, he became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all that concerned his Maſter; and by his great Addreſs in the Management of that Knowledge, ſaved him Ten thouſand Pounds. Soon after this Accident, <hi>Trueman</hi>'s Unkle left him a conſiderable Eſtate. Upon receiving that Advice, he returned to <hi>England,</hi> and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Almira</hi> of her Father. The Father over joy'd at the Match, offer'd him the 10000 <hi>l.</hi> he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0397200204:119"/>
had ſaved him, with the further Propoſal of reſigning to him all his Buſineſs, <hi>Trueman</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed both, and retired into the Country with his Bride, contented with his own Fortune, tho' perfectly skill'd in all the Methods of improving it.</p>
                     <p>It is to be noted, That <hi>Trueman</hi> refuſed Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand Pounds with another young Lady; ſo that reckoning both his Self-Denials, he is to have in your Court the Merit of having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven 30000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Woman he loved.

               <p>IN every Party there are Two Sorts of Men, the <hi>Rigid</hi> and the <hi>Supple.</hi> The <hi>Rigid</hi> are an intractable Race of Mortals, who act upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and will not, forſooth, fall into any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are not conſiſtent with their received
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0397200204:120"/>
Notions of Honour. Theſe are Perſons of a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, unpliant Morality, that ſullenly adhere to their Friends when they are diſgraced, and to their Principles, tho' they are exploded. I ſhall therefore give up this ſtiff-necked Generation to their own Obſtinacy, and turn my Thoughts to the Advantage of the <hi>Supple,</hi> who pay their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to Places, and not Perſons; and without enſlaving themſelves to any particular Scheme of Opinions, are as ready to change their Conduct in Point of Sentiment, as of Faſhion. The well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined Part of a Court are generally ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at their Exerciſe, that you may ſee a whole Aſſembly, from Front to Rear, face about at once to a new Man of Power, tho' at the ſame Time they turn their Backs upon him that brought them thither. The great Hardſhip theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant Members of Society are under, ſeems to be the Want of Warning upon any approaching Change or Revolution; ſo that they are obliged in a Hurry to tack about with every Wind, and ſtop ſhort in the Midſt of a full Career, to the great Surprize and Deriſion of their Beholders.</p>
               <p>When a Man foreſees a decaying Miniſtry, he has Leiſure to grow a Malecontent, reflect upon the preſent Conduct, and by gradual Murmurs fall off from his Friends into a new Party, by juſt Steps and Meaſures. For Want of ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, I have formerly known a very well-bred Perſon refuſe to return a Bow of a Man whom he thought in Diſgrace, that was next Day made Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State; and another, who after a long Neglect of a Miniſter, came to his Levee, and made Profeſſions of Zeal for his Service the very Day before he was turned out.</p>
               <p>This produces alſo unavoidable Confuſions and Miſtakes in the Deſcriptions of great Mens Parts and Merits. That ancient Lyrick, Mr. <hi>D'Urfey,</hi> ſome Years ago writ a Dedication to a certain Lord, in which he celebrated him for the greateſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0397200204:121"/>
Poet and Critick of that Age, upon a Miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Dyer</hi>'s Letter, that his noble Patron was made Lord Chamberlain. In ſhort, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Votes Speeches, and Sermons, have been thrown away, and turned to no Account, meerly for Want of due and timely Intelligence. Nay it has been known, that a Panegyrick has been half printed off, when the Poet, upon the Removal of the Miniſter, has been forced to alter it into a Satyr.</p>
               <p>For the Conduct therefore of ſuch uſeful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are ready to do their Country Service up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions, I have an Engine in my Study, which is a Sort of a Political Barometer, or, to ſpeak more intelligibly, a State <hi>Weather-Glaſs,</hi> that, by the riſing and falling of a certain Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Liquor, preſages all Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Government, as the common Glaſs does thoſe of the Weather. This Weather-Glaſs is ſaid to have been invented by <hi>Cardan,</hi> and given by him as a Preſent to his great Countryman and Contemporary <hi>Machiavel,</hi> which (by the Way) may ſerve to rectify a received Error in Chronology, that places one of theſe ſome Years after the other. How or when it came into my Hands, I ſhall deſire to be excuſed, if I keep to my ſelf; but ſo it is, that I have walked by it for the better Part of a Century, to my Safety at leaſt, if not to my Advantage; and have among my Papers, a Regiſter of all the Changes that have happened in it from the Middle of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign.</p>
               <p>In the Time of that Princeſs, it ſtood long at <hi>ſettled Fair.</hi> At the latter End of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, it fell to <hi>Cloudy.</hi> It held ſeveral Years after at <hi>Stormy;</hi> inſomuch that at laſt deſpairing of ſeeing any <hi>Clear</hi> Weather at Home, I follow'd the Royal Exile, and ſome Time after finding my Glaſs riſe, returned to my native Country with the reſt of the Loyaliſts. I was then in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0397200204:122"/>
Hopes to paſs the Remainder of my Days in <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Fair:</hi> But alas! during the greateſt Part of that Reign, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation lay in a <hi>dead Calm,</hi> which, as it is uſual, was followed by high Winds and Tempeſts till of late Years: In which, with unſpeakable Joy and Satisfaction, I have ſeen our Political Weather returned to <hi>ſettled Fair.</hi> I muſt only obſerve, that for all this laſt Summer my Glaſs has pointed at Changeable. Upon the whole, I often apply to Fortune <hi>Aenaeas</hi>'s Speech to the Sybil:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Non ulla Laborum,</l>

               <p>The Advantages which have accured to thoſe whom I have adviſed in their Affairs, by Vertue of this Sort of Praeſcience, have been very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. A Nephew of mine, who has never put his Money into the Stocks, or taken it out, without my Advice, has in a few Years raiſed Five hundred Pounds to almoſt ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. As for my ſelf, who look upon Riches to conſiſt rather in Content than Poſſeſſions, and meaſure the Greatneſs of the Mind rather by its Tranquility than its Ambition. I have ſeldom uſed my Glaſs to make my Way in the World, but often to retire from it. This is a By-Path to Happineſs, which was firſt diſcovered to me by a moſt pleaſing Apothegm of <hi>Pythagoras: When the Winds,</hi> ſays he, <hi>riſe, worſhip the Eccho.</hi> That great Philoſopher (whether to make his Doctrines the more venerable, or to guild his Precepts with the Beauty of Imagination, or to awaken the Curioſity of his Diſciples; for I will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what is uſually ſaid, that he did it to conceal his Wiſdom from the Vulgar) has couched ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral admirable Precepts in remote Alluſions and myſterious Sentences.

                  <hi>LYſander</hi> has writ to me out of the Country, and tells me, after many other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that he had paſſed a great deal of Time with much Pleaſure and Tranquility, till his Happineſs was interrupted by an indiſcreet Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, who came down into thoſe Parts to viſit a Relation.

He was got to the Bank of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet, covered by a pleaſing Shade, and fanned by a ſoft Breeze, which threw his Mind into that Sort of Compoſure and Attention, in which a Man, though with Indolence, enjoys the utmoſt Livelineſs of his Spirits, and the greateſt Strength of his Mind at the ſame Time. In this State, <hi>Lyſander</hi> repreſents that he was reading <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Georgicks;</hi> when on a ſudden the Gentleman abovementioned ſurpriſed him, and, without any
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0397200204:124"/>
Manner of Preparation, falls upon him at once, <q rend="inline">'What! I have found you out at laſt, after ſearching all over the Wood. We wanted you at Cards after Dinner, but you are much better employed. I have heard indeed that you are an excellent Scholar: But at the ſame Time, is it not a little unkind to rob the Ladies, who like you ſo well, of the Pleaſure of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? But that is indeed the Misfortune of you great Scholars, you are ſeldom ſo fit for the World, as thoſe who never trouble themſelves with Books. Well, I ſee you are taken up with your Learning there, and I'll leave you.'</q> 
                  <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> ſays, he made him no Anſwer, but took a Reſolution to complain to me.</p>
               <p>It is a ſubſtantial Affliction, when Men govern themſelves by the Rules of good Breeding, that by the very Force of them they are ſubjected to the Inſolence of thoſe who either never will, or never can, underſtand them. The ſuperficial Part of Mankind form to themſelves little Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Behaviour from the Outſide of Things. By the Force of theſe narrow Conceptions, they act amongſt themſelves with Applauſe, and do not apprehend they are contemptible to thoſe of higher Underſtanding, who are reſtrained by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies above their Knowledge from ſhowing a Diſlike. Hence it is, that becauſe Complaiſance is a good Quality in Converſation, one Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent takes upon him on all Occaſions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; and becauſe Mirth is agreeable, another thinks fit eternally to jeſt. I have of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many Packets of Letters complaining of theſe ſpreading Evils. A Lady who is lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the <hi>Bath</hi> acquaints me, there was in the Stage-Coach wherein ſhe went down a common Flatterer, and a common Jeſter. Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were (ſhe tells me) Rivals in her Favour and adds, If there ever happened a Caſe wherein of Two Perſons One was not liked more than
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0397200204:125"/>
another, it was in that Journey. They differed only in Proportion to the Degree of Diſlike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Nauſeous and the Inſipid. Both theſe Characters of Men are born out of a Barrenneſs of Imagination. They are never Fools by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but become ſuch out of an impotent Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being what ſhe never intended them, Men of Wit and Converſation. I therefore think fit to declare, That according to the known Laws of this Land, a Man may be a very honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and enjoy himſelf and his Friend, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being a Wit; and I abſolve all Men from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pains to be ſuch for the future. As the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe ſtands, is it not very unhappy that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> muſt be attacked and applauded in a Wood, and <hi>Corinna</hi> jolted and commended in a Stage-Coach; and this for no manner of Reaſon, but becauſe other People have a Mind to ſhow their Parts? I grant indeed, if theſe People (as they have Underſtanding enough for it) would confine their Accompliſhments to thoſe of their own Degree of Talents, it were to be tolerated; but when they are ſo inſolent as to interrupt the Meditations of the Wiſe, the Converſations of the Agreeable, and the whole Behaviour of the Modeſt, it becomes a Grievance naturally in my Juriſdiction. Among themſelves, I cannot only overlook, but approve it. I was preſent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Day at a Converſation, where a Man of this Height of Breeding and Senſe told a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the ſame Form, To be ſure, Madam, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing muſt pleaſe that comes from a Lady. She anſwer'd, I know, Sir, you are ſo much a Gentleman that you think ſo.

               <p>NAture is full of Wonders; every Atom is a ſtanding Miracle, and endowed with ſuch Qualities, as could not be impreſſed on it by a Power and Wiſdom leſs than Infinite. For this Reaſon, I would not diſcourage any Searches that are made into the moſt minute and trivial Parts of the Creation. However, ſince the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in the nobleſt Fields of Speculation, it is, methinks, the Mark of a little Genius to be wholly converſant among Inſects, Reptiles, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcules, and thoſe trifling Rarities that furniſh out the Apartment of a Virtuoſo.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Men whoſe Heads are ſo odly turned this Way, that tho' they are utter Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the common Occurrences of Life, they are able to diſcover the Sex of a Cockle, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Generation of a Mite, in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. They are ſo little verſed in the World, that they ſcarce know a Horſe from an Ox; but at the ſame Time will tell you, with a great deal of Gravity, That a Flea is a Rhinoceros, and a Snail an Hermaphrodite. I have known one of theſe whimſical Philoſophers who has ſet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Value upon a Collection of Spiders than he would upon a Collection of Spiders than he would upon a Flock of Sheep, and has ſold his Coat off his Back to purchaſe a Tarantula.</p>
               <p>I would not have a Scholar wholly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe Secrets and Curioſities of Nature; but certainly the Mind of Man, that is capable of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0397200204:129"/>
ſo much higher Contemplations, ſhould not be altogether fixed upon ſuch mean and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Objects. Obſervations of this Kind are apt to alienate us too much from the Knowledge of the World, and to make us ſerious upon Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, by which Means they expoſe Philoſophy to the Ridicule of the Witty, and Contempt of the Ignorant. In ſhort, Studies of this Nature ſhould be the Diverſions, Relaxations, and Amuſements; not the Care, Buſineſs, and Concern of Life.</p>
               <p>It is indeed wonderful to conſider, that there ſhould be a Sort of learned Men who are wholly employed in gathering together the Refuſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I may call it ſo, and hoarding up in their Cheſts and Cabinets ſuch Creatures as others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly avoid the Sight of. One does not know how to mention ſome of the moſt precious Parts of their Treaſure, without a Kind of an Apology for it. I have been ſhown a Beetle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at Twenty Crowns, and a Toad at an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; But we muſt take this for a general Rule, That whatever appears trivial or obſcene in the common Notions of the World, looks grave and philoſophical in the Eye of a Virtuoſo.</p>

               <p>AS I was paſſing by a Neighbour's Houſe this Morning, I overheard the Wife of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſpeak Things to her Husband which gave me much Diſturbance, and put me in Mind of a Character which I wonder I have ſo long omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that is, an outragious Species of the Fair Sex which is diſtinguiſhed by the Term Scolds. The Generality of Women are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loquacious: Therefore meer Volubility of Speech is not to be imputed to them, but ſhould be conſidered with Pleaſure when it is uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch Paſſions as tend to ſweeten or adorn Converſation: But when, thro' Rage, Females are vehement in their Eloquence, nothing in the World has ſo ill an Effect upon the Features; for by the Force of it, I have ſeen the moſt Amiable become the moſt Deformed; and ſhe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared one of the Graces, immediately turned into one of the Furies. I humbly conceive, the great Cauſe of this Evil may proceed from a falſe Notion the Ladies have of what we call a Modeſt Woman. They have too narrow a Conception of this lovely Character, and believe they have not at all forfeited their Pretenſions to it, provided they have no Imputations on their Chaſtity. But alas! the young Fellows know they pick out bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Women in the Side-Boxes, than many of thoſe who paſs upon the World and themſelves for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt.</p>

The Neighbour I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one of your common modeſt Women, that is to ſay, thoſe as are ordinarily reckoned ſuch. Her Husband knows every Pain in Life with her but Jealouſy. Now becauſe ſhe is clear in this Particular, the Man can't ſay his Soul's his own, but ſhe cries, No modeſt Woman is reſpected now a-days. What adds to the Comedy in this Caſe is, that it is very ordinary with this Sort of Women to talk in the Language of Diſtreſs: They will complain of the forlorn Wretchedneſs of their Condition, and then the poor helpleſs Creatures ſhall throw the next Thing they can lay their Hands on at the Perſon who offends them. Our Neighbour was only ſaying to his Wife, ſhe went a little too fine, when ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately pulled his Periwig off, and ſtamping it under her Feet, wrung her Hands, and ſaid, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver modeſt Woman was ſo uſed: Theſe Ladies of irreſiſtible Modeſty are thoſe who make Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue unamiable; not that they can be ſaid to be virtuous, but as they live without Scandal; and being under the common Denomination of being ſuch, Men fear to meet their Faults in thoſe who are as agreeable as they are innocent.</p>
               <p>I take the Bully among Men, and the Scold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Women, to draw the Foundation of their Actions from the ſame Defect in the Mind A Bully thinks Honour conſiſts wholly in being brave, and therefore has Regard to no one Rule of Life, if he preſerves himſelf from the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cowardize. The froward Woman knows Chaſtity to be the firſt Merit in a Woman; and therefore, ſince no one can call her one ugly Name, ſhe calls all Mankind all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ladies, where their Companions are ſo imprudent as to take their Speeches for any other than Exerciſes of their own Lungs, and their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0397200204:134"/>
Husbands Patience, gain by the Force of being reſiſted, and flame with open Fury, which is no Way to be oppoſed but by being neglected: Tho' at the ſame Time Humane Frailty makes it very hard to reliſh the Philoſophy of contemning even frivolous Reproach. There is a very pretty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Infirmity in the Man of the beſt Senſe that ever was, no leſs a Perſon than <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf. According to <hi>Milton</hi>'s Deſcription of the Firſt Couple, as ſoon as they had fallen, and the turbulent Paſſions of Anger, Hatred, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, firſt enter'd their Breaſts, <hi>Adam</hi> grew moody, and talked to his Wife, as you may find it in the 359th Page, and 9th Book, of <hi>Paradiſe Leſt,</hi> in the <hi>Octave</hi> Edition, which out of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicks, and put into Domeſtick Stile, would run thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Madam, If my Advice had been of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with you when that ſtrange Deſire of Gadding poſſeſſed you this Morning, we had ſtill been happy: But your curſed Vanity and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your own Conduct, which is certainly very wavering when it ſeeks Occaſions of being proved, has ruined both your ſelf, and me who truſted you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eve</hi> had no Fan in her Hand to ruffle, or Tucker to pull down, but with a reproachful Air ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Sir, Do you impute that to my Deſire of Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which might have happened to your ſelf with all your Wiſdom and Gravity?'</q> The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſpoke ſo excellently, and with ſo good a Grace, that—Beſides, <q rend="inline">'What Harm had I ever done him, that he ſhould deſign me any? Was I to have been always at your Side, I might as well have continued there, and been but your Rib ſtill: But if I was ſo weak a Creature as you thought me, Why did you not interpoſe your ſage Authority more abſolutely?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0397200204:135"/>
You denied me going as faintly, as you ſay I reſiſted the Serpent. Had not you been too eaſie, neither you or I had now tranſgreſſed.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> replied, <q rend="inline">'Why, <hi>Eve.</hi> haſt thou the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to upbraid me as the Cauſe of thy Tranſgreſſion for my Indulgence to thee? Thus it will ever be with him who truſts too much to Woman: At the ſame Time that ſhe refuſes to be governed, if ſhe ſuffers by her Oſtinacy, ſhe will accuſe the Man that ſhall leave her to her ſelf.'</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus they in mutual Accuſation ſpent</l>
                  <l>The fruitleſs Hours, but neither ſelf condemning:</l>
                  <l>And of their vain Conteſt appear'd no End.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This to the Modern will appear but a very faint Piece of Conjugal Enmity; but you are to conſider, that they were but juſt begun to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and they wanted new Words for expreſſing their new Paſſions. But her accuſing him of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her go, and telling him how good a Speaker, and how fine a Gentleman the Devil was, we muſt reckon, allowing for the Improvements of Time, that ſhe gave him the ſame Provocation as if ſhe had called him Cuckold. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and familiar Terms with which the ſame Caſe, repeated daily for ſo many Thouſand Years, has furniſhed the preſent Generation, were not then in Uſe; but the Foundation of Debate has ever been the ſame, a Contention about their Merit and Wiſdom. Our general Mother was a Beauty, and hearing there was another now in the World, could not forbear (as <hi>Adam</hi> tells her) ſhowing her ſelf, though to the Devil, by whom the ſame Vanity made her liable to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</p>
               <p>I cannot, with all the Help of Science and, Aſtrology, find any other Remedy for this Evil but what was the Medicine in this firſt Quarrel; which was, as appeared in the next Book, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0397200204:136"/>
they were convinced of their being both weak, but one weaker than the other.</p>
               <p>If it were poſſible that the Beauteous could but rage a little before a Glaſs, and ſee their pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Countenances grow wild, it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but it would have a very good Effect; but that would require Temper: For Lady <hi>Firebrand,</hi> upon obſerving her Features ſwell when her Maid vexed her the other Day, ſtamped her Dreſſing-Glaſs under her Feet. In this Caſe, when one of this Temper is moved, ſhe is like a Witch in an Operation, and makes all Things turn round with her. The very Fabrick is in a Vertigo when ſhe begins to charm. In an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, whatever was the Occaſion that moved her Blood, ſhe has ſuch intolerable Servants, <hi>Betty</hi> is ſo aukward, <hi>Tom</hi> can't carry a Meſſage, and her Husband has ſo little Reſpect for her, that ſhe, poor Woman, is weary of this Life, and was born to be unhappy.</p>

               <p>I Chanced to riſe very early one particular Morning this Summer, and took a Walk into the Country to divert my ſelf among the Fields and Meadows, while the Green was new, and the Flowers in their Bloom. As at this Seaſon of the Year every Lane is a beautiful Walk, and every Hedge full of Noſegays, I loſt my ſelf with a great deal of Pleaſure among ſeveral Thickets and Buſhes that were filled with a great Variety of Birds, and an agreeable Confuſion of Notes, which formed the pleaſanteſt Scene in the World to one who had paſs'd a whole Winter in Noiſe and Smoak. The Freſhneſs of the Dews that lay upon every Thing about me, with the cool Breath of the Morning, which inſpired the Birds with ſo many delightful Inſtincts, created in me the ſame Kind of animal Pleaſure, and made my Heart overflow with ſuch ſecret Emotions of Joy and Satisfaction as are not to be deſcribed or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. On this Occaſion I could not but reflect upon a beautiful Simile in <hi>Milton:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>As one who long in populous City pent,</l>
                     <l>Where Houſes thick, and Sewers, annoy the Air,</l>
                     <l>Forth iſſuing on a Summer's Morn, to breath</l>
                     <l>Among the pleaſant Villages, and Farms</l>
                     <l>Adjoin'd, from each Thing met conceives Delight:</l>
                     <l>The Smell of Grain, or tedded Graſs, or Kine,</l>
                     <l>Or Dairy, each rural Sight, each rural Sound.</l>
                  </q> 
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0397200204:138"/>
Thoſe who are converſant in the Writings of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Authors, receive an additional Entertainment from the Country, as it revives in their Memories thoſe charming Deſcriptions with which ſuch Authors do frequently abound.</p>
               <p>I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile in <hi>Milton,</hi> and applying it to my ſelf, when I obſerved to the Windward of me a black Cloud falling to the Earth in long Trails of Rain, which made me betake my ſelf for Shelter to a Houſe which I ſaw at a little Diſtance from the Place where I was walking. As I ſat in the Porch, I heard the Voices of Two or Three Perſons, who ſeemed very earneſt in Diſcourſe. My Curioſity was raiſed when I heard the Names of <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and as their Talk ſeemed to run on ancient Heroes, I concluded there could not be any Secret in it; for which Reaſon I thought I might very fairly liſten to what they ſaid.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral Parallels between great Men, which appeared to me altogether groundleſs and chimerical, I was ſurprized to hear one ſay, That he valued the <hi>Black Prince</hi> more than the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme.</hi> How the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> ſhould become a Rival of the <hi>Black Prince</hi>'s, I could not conceive: And was more ſtartled when I heard a Second affirm with great Vehemence, That if the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> was not going off, he ſhould like him better than either of them. He added, That tho' the Seaſon was ſo changeable, the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> was in blooming Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I was wondering to my ſelf from whence they had received this odd Intelligence, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when I heard them mention the Names of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other great Generals, as the Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who, they ſaid, were both running away. To which they added, what I entirely agreed with them in, That the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was very weak, but that the Mareſchal
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0397200204:139"/>
                  <hi>Villars</hi> ſtill kept his Colours. At laſt one of them told the Company, If they would go along with him, he would ſhow them a Chimney-Sweeper and a Painted Lady in the ſame Bed, which he was ſure would very much pleaſe them. The Shower which had driven them, as well as my ſelf, into the Houſe, was now over: And as they were paſſing by me into the Garden, I asked them to let me be one of their Company.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman of the Houſe told me, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Flowers, it would be worth my while, for that he believed he could ſhow me ſuch a Blow of Tulips as was not to be matched in the whole Country.</p>
               <p>I accepted the Offer, and immediately found that they had been talking in Terms of Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that the Kings and Generals they had mentioned were only ſo many Tulips, to which the Gardiners, according to their uſual Cuſtom, had given ſuch high Titles and Appellations of Honour.</p>
               <p>I was very much pleaſed and aſtoniſhed at the glorious Show of theſe gay Vegetables, that aroſe in great Profuſion on all the Banks about us. Sometimes I conſidered them with the Eye of an ordinary Spectator as ſo many beautiful Objects, varniſhed over with a natural Gloſs, and ſtained with ſuch a Variety of Colours, as are not to be equalled in any artificial Dyes or Tinctures. Sometimes I conſidered every Leaf as an elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Piece of Tiſſue, in which the Threads and Fibres were woven together into different Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations, which gave a different Colouring to the Light as it glanced on the ſeveral Parts of the Surface. Sometimes I conſidered the whole Bed of Tulips, according to the Notion of the greateſt Mathematician and Philoſopher that ever lived, as a Multitude of Optick Inſtruments, deſigned for the ſeparating Light into all thoſe various Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of which it is compoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0397200204:140"/>
I was awakened out of theſe my Philoſophical Speculations, by obſerving the Company often ſeemed to laugh at me. I accidentally praiſed a Tulip as one of the fineſt that I ever ſaw; upon which they told me, 'twas a common Fool's-Coat. Upon that I praiſed a Second, which it ſeems was but another Kind of Fool's-Coat. I had the ſame Fate with Two or Three more; for which Reaſon I deſired the Owner of the Garden to let me know which were the fineſt of the Flowers, for that I was ſo unskilful in the Art, that I thought the moſt beautiful were the moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that thoſe which had the gayeſt Colours were the moſt beautiful. The Gentleman ſmiled at my Ignorance: He ſeemed a very plain honeſt Man, and a Perſon of good Senſe, had not his Head been touched with that Diſtemper which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tulippomania;</hi> inſomuch that he would talk very rationally on any Subject in the World but a Tulip.</p>
               <p>He told me, That he valued the Bed of Flowers which lay before us, and was not above Twenty Yards in Length, and Two in Breadth, more than he would the beſt Hundred Acres of Land in <hi>England;</hi> and added, That it would have been worth twice the Money it is, if a fooliſh Cook-Maid of his had not almoſt ruined him the laſt Winter, by miſtaking an Handful of Tulip-Roots for an Heap of Onions, and by that Means (ſays he) made me a Diſh of Porridge, that coſt me above 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. He then ſhowed me what he thought the fineſt of his Tulips, which I found received all their Value from their Rarity and Oddneſs, and put me in Mind of your great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which are not always the greateſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>I have often looked upon it as a Piece of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that I have never fallen into any of theſe fantaſtical Taſts, nor eſteemed any Thing the more for its being uncommon and hard to be met
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0397200204:141"/>
with. For this Reaſon, I look upon the whole Country in Spring-time as a ſpacious Garden, and make as many Viſits to a Spot of Daizies, or a Bank of Violets, as a Floriſt does to his Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Parterres. There is not a Buſh in Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom within a Mile of me which I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, nor ſcarce a Daffodil or Cowſlip that withers away in my Neighbourhood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my miſſing it. I walked Home in this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind through ſeveral Fields and Meadows with an unſpeakable Pleaſure, not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the Bounty of Providence, which has made the moſt pleaſing and moſt beautiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the moſt ordinary and moſt common.</p>

               <p>NEver were Men ſo perplexed as a ſelect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of us were this Evening with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of profeſſed Wits, who through our ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and their own Confidence, had thought fit to pin themſelves upon a Gentleman who had owned to them that he was going to meet ſuch and ſuch Perſons, and named us one by one. Theſe pert Puppies immediately reſolved to come with him, and from the Beginning to the End of the Night entertained each other with Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, to which we were perfect Strangers. I am come Home very much tired; for the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0397200204:142"/>
was ſo irkſome to me, that it ſurpaſſes all other I ever knew, inſomuch that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon this Sorrow with Pleaſure, though it is paſt.</p>
               <p>An eaſy Manner of Converſation is the moſt deſirable Quality a Man can have; and for that Reaſon Coxcombs will take upon them to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with People whom they never ſaw before. What adds to the Vexation of it is, that they will act upon the Foot of knowing you by Fame, and rally with you, as they call it, by repeating what your Enemies ſay of you; and court you, as they think, by uttering to your Face at a wrong Time all the kind Things your Friends ſpeak of you in your Abſence.</p>
               <p>Theſe People are the more dreadful, the more they have of what is uſually called Wit: For a lively Imagination, when it is not governed by a good Underſtanding, makes ſuch miſerable Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock both in Converſation and Buſineſs, that it lays you defenceleſs, and fearful to throw the leaſt Word in its Way, that may give it new Matter for its further Errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tom. Mercett</hi> has as quick a Fancy as any one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but there is no reaſonable Man can bear him half an Hour. His Purpoſe is to entertain, and it is of no Conſequence to him what is ſaid, ſo it be what is called well ſaid; as if a Man muſt bear a Wound with Patience, becauſe he that puſhed at you came up with a good Air and Mien. That Part of Life which we ſpend in Company, is the moſt pleaſing of all our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore I think our Behaviour in it ſhould have its Laws as well as the Part of our Being, which is generally eſteemed the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. From hence it is, that from long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I have made it a Maxim. that however we may pretend to take Satisfaction in ſprightly Mirth and high Jollity, there is no great Pleaſure in any Company where the Baſis of the Society
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0397200204:143"/>
is not mutual Good-Will. When this is in the Room, every trifling Circumſtance, the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Accident, the Abſurdity of a Servant, the Repetition of an old Story, the Look of a Man when he is telling it, the moſt indifferent and the moſt ordinary Occurrences, are Matters which produce Mirth and good Humour. I went to ſpend an Hour after this Manner with ſome Friends who enjoy it in Perfection whenever they meet, when thoſe Deſtroyers above-mentioned came in upon us. There is not a Man among them has any Notion of Diſtinction of Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to one another, either in their Fortunes or their Talents, when they are in Company. Or if any Reflexion to the contrary occurs in their Thoughts, it only ſtrikes a Delight upon their Minds, that ſo much Wiſdom and Power is in Poſſeſſion of one whom they love and eſteem.</p>
               <p>In theſe my Lucubrations, I have frequently dwelt upon this one Topick. It would make ſhort Work for us Reformers, for it is only Want of making this a Poſition that renders ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters bad, which would otherwiſe be good. <hi>Tom Mercett</hi> means no Man Ill, but does Ill to every Body. His Ambition is to be witty; and to carry on that Deſign, he breaks through all Things that other People hold Sacred. If he thought Wit was no Way to be uſed but to the Advantage of Society, that Sprightlineſs would have a new Turn, and we ſhould expect what he is going to ſay with Satisfaction inſtead of Fear. It is no Excuſe for being miſchievous, that a Man is miſchievous without Malice; nor will it be thought an Attonement that the Ill was done not to injure the Party concern'd, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Indifferent.</p>
               <p>It is, methinks, a very great Error, that we ſhould not profeſs Honeſty in Converſation as much as in Commerce. If we conſider, that there is no greater Misfortune than to be ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0397200204:144"/>
where we love the turning a Man to Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule among his Friends, we rob him of greater Enjoyments than he could have purchaſed by his Wealth; yet he that laughs at him, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be the laſt Man who would hurt him in this Caſe of leſs Conſequence. It has been ſaid, the Hiſtory of <hi>Don Quixote</hi> utterly deſtroyed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Gallantry in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we may ſay much more truly, that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Ridicule has done as much Injury to the true Reliſh of Company in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Such Satisfactions as ariſe from the ſecret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of our ſelves to others, with relation to their inferior Fortunes or Merit, are mean and unworthy. The true and high State of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is when Men communicate their Thoughts to each other upon ſuch Subjects, and in ſuch a Manner, as would be pleaſant if there were no ſuch Thing as Folly in the World; for it is but a low Condition of Wit in one Man which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Folly in another.</p>

               <p>HAving received many Letters filled with Compliments and Acknowledgments for my late uſeful Diſcovery of the Political Barome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall here communicate to the Publick an Account of my Eccleſiaſtical Thermometer, the latter giving as manifeſt Prognoſtications of the Changes and Revolutions in Church, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer does of thoſe in State, and both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely neceſſary for every prudent Subject who is reſolved to keep what he has, and get what he can.</p>
               <p>The Church Thermometer, which I am now to treat of, is ſuppoſed to have been invented in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, about the Time when that Religious Prince put ſome to Death for owning the Pope's Supremacy, and others for denying Tranſubſtantiation. I do not find, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any great Uſe made of this Inſtrument till it fell into the Hands of a learned and vigilant Prieſt or Miniſter, (for he frequently wrote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both one and the other) who was ſome Time Vicar of <hi>Bray.</hi> This Gentleman lived in his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caridge to a good old Age; and after having ſeen ſeveral Succeſſions of his neighbouring Clergy either burnt or baniſh'd, departed this Life with the Satisfaction of having never deſerted his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0397200204:147"/>
Flock, and died Vicar of <hi>Bray.</hi> As this Glaſs was firſt deſigned to calculate the different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat in Religion, as it raged in Popery, or as it cooled and grew temperate in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it was marked at ſeveral Diſtances, after the Manner our ordinary Thermometer is to this Day, <hi>viz. Extream Hot ſultry Hot, very Hot, Hot, Warm, Temperate, Cold, juſt Freezing, Froſt, hard Froſt, great Froſt, extream Cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is well known, that <hi>Toricellius,</hi> the Inventor of the common Weather-Glaſs, made the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a long Tube which held Thirty two Foot of Water; and that a more modern Virtuoſo finding ſuch a Machine altogether unweildy and uſeleſs, and conſidering that Thirty two Inches of Quickſilver weigh'd as much as ſo many Foot of Water in a Tube of the ſame Circumference, invented that fizeable Inſtrument which is now in Uſe. After this Manner, that I might adapt the Thermometer I am now ſpeaking of to the preſent Conſtitution of our Church, as divided into <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low,</hi> I have made ſome neceſſary Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations both in the Tube and the Fluid it contains. In the firſt Place, I ordered a Tube to be caſt in a Planetary Hour, and took Care to ſeal it Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically, when the Sun was in Conjunction with <hi>Saturn.</hi> I then took the proper Precautions about the Fluid, which is a Compound of Two very different Liquors; one of them a Spirit drawn out of a ſtrong heady Wine; the other a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sort of Rock Water, colder than Ice, and clearer than Chryſtal. The Spirit is of a red fiery Colour, and ſo very apt to ferment, that unleſs it be mingled with a Proportion of the Water, or pent up very cloſe, it will burſt the Veſſel that holds it, and fly up in Fume and Smoak. The Water on the contrary is of ſuch a ſubtle piercing Cold, that unleſs it be mingled with a Proportion of the Spirits, it will ſink through almoſt every Thing that it is put into, and ſeems to be of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0397200204:148"/>
ſame Nature as the Water mentioned by <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> which, ſays the Hiſtorian, could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in nothing but in the Hoof or (as the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Manuſcript has it) in the Skull of an Aſs. The Thermometer is marked according to the following Figure, which I ſet down at length, not only to give my Reader a clear Idea of it, but alſo to fill up my Paper.<list>
                     <item>Ignorance.</item>
                     <item>Perſecution.</item>
                     <item>Wrath.</item>
                     <item>Zeal.</item>
                     <item>CHURCH.</item>
                     <item>Moderation.</item>
                     <item>Lukewarmneſs.</item>
                     <item>Infidelity.</item>
                     <item>Ignorance.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader will obſerve, that the Church is placed in the Middle Point of the Glaſs, between <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> the Situation in which ſhe always flouriſhes, and in which every good <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi> wiſhes her who is a Friend to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his Country. However, when it mounts to <hi>Zeal,</hi> it is not amiſs; and when it ſinks to <hi>Moderation,</hi> is ſtill in a moſt admirable Temper. The worſt of it is, that when once it begins to riſe, it has ſtill an Inclination to aſcend, inſomuch that it is apt to climb from <hi>Zeal</hi> to <hi>Wrath,</hi> and from <hi>Wrath</hi> to <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ends in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and very often proceeds from it. In the ſame Manner it frequently takes its Progreſs through the lower Half of the Glaſs; and when it has a Tendency to fall, will gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcend from <hi>Moderation</hi> to <hi>Lukewarmneſs,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0397200204:149"/>
from <hi>Lukewarmneſs</hi> to <hi>Infidelity,</hi> which very often terminates in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and always proceeds from it.</p>
               <p>It is a common Obſervation, that the ordinary Thermometer will be affected by the breathing of People who are in the Room where it ſtands; and indeed, it is almoſt incredible to conceive how the Glaſs I am now deſcribing will fall by the Breath of a Multitude crying <hi>Popery;</hi> or on the contrary, how it will riſe when the ſame Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (as it ſometimes happens) cry out in the ſame Breath, <hi>The Church is in Danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had finiſhed this my Glaſs, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted it to the above-mentioned Scale of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that I might make proper Experiments with it, I carried it under my Cloak to ſeveral Coffee-houſes, and other Places of Reſort about this great City. At St. <hi>James</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſtood at <hi>Moderation;</hi> but at <hi>Will</hi>'s, to my extream Surprize, it ſubſided to the very loweſt Mark on the Glaſs. At the <hi>Grecian,</hi> it mounted but juſt one Point higher; at the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> it ſtill aſcended Two Decrees: <hi>Child</hi>'s fetched it up to <hi>Zeal,</hi> and other adjacent Coffee-houſes to <hi>Wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It fell into the lower Half of the Glaſs as I went further into the City, till at length it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at <hi>Moderation,</hi> where it continued all the Time I ſtay'd about the <hi>Change,</hi> as alſo whilſt I paſſed by the <hi>Bank.</hi> And here I cannot but take Notice, that through the whole Courſe of my Remarks, I never obſerved my Glaſs to riſe at the ſame Time that the Stocks did.</p>
               <p>To compleat the Experiment, I prevailed upon a Friend of mine, who works under me in the Occult Sciences, to make a Progreſs with my Glaſs through the whole Iſland of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> and after his Return, to preſent me with a Regiſter of his Obſervations. I gueſſed before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand at the Temper of ſeveral Places he paſſed through, by the Characters they have had Time
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0397200204:150"/>
out of Mind. Thus that facetious Divine, Dr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> ſpeaking of the Town of <hi>Banbury</hi> near a Hundred Years ago, tells us, it was a Place fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Cakes and <hi>Zeal,</hi> which I find by my Glaſs is true to this Day as to the latter Part of this Deſcription; though I muſt confeſs, it is not in the ſame Reputation for Cakes that it was in the Time of that learned Author; and thus of other Places. In ſhort, I have now by me, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in an Alphabetical Order, all the Counties, Corporations and Boroughs, in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> with their reſpective Tempers, as they ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to my Thermometer: But this I ſhall keep to my ſelf, becauſe I would by no Means do any Thing that may ſeem to influence any enſuing Elections.</p>
               <p>The Point of Doctrine which I would propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by this my Invention, is the ſame which was long ago advanced by that able Teacher <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> out of whom I have taken my Text for this Diſcourſe: We ſhould be careful not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot our ſelves in the Purſuits even of Virtue. Whether <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>Moderation</hi> be the Point we aim at, let us keep Fire out of the one, and Froſt out of the other. But alas! the World is too Wiſe to want ſuch a Precaution. The Terms <hi>High-Church</hi> and <hi>Low-Church,</hi> as commonly uſed, do not ſo much denote a Principle, as they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a Party. They are like Words of Battle, that have nothing to do with their original Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, but are only given out to keep a Body of Men together, and to let them know Friends from Enemies.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I have conſidered with ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Attention the Influence which the Opinions of theſe great National Sects have upon their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and do look upon it as one of the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Things of our Times, that Multitudes of honeſt Gentlemen, who entirely agree in their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0397200204:151"/>
Lives, ſhould take it in their Heads to differ in their Religion.</p>

               <p>AS I was this Morning going out of my Houſe, a little Boy in a black Coat delivered to me the following Letter.

The Letter ran thus:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <opener>

                        </salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Hope you will not be ſurpriſed to receive a Letter from the Widow <hi>Gimcrack.</hi> You know, Sir, that I have lately loſt a very whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Husband, who I find, by one of your laſt Weeks Papers, was not altogether a Stranger to you. When I married this Gentleman, he had a very handſome Eſtate; but upon buying a Set of Microſcopes, he was choſen a Fellow of the Royal Society; from which Time I do not remember ever to have heard him ſpeak as other People did, or talk in a Manner that any of his Family could underſtand him. He uſed, however, to paſs away his Time very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently in Converſation with ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0397200204:152"/>
of that learned Body; for which Reaſon I never adviſed him againſt their Company for ſeveral Years, till at laſt I found his Brain was quite turned with their Diſcourſes. The firſt Symptom which he diſcovered of his being a Virtuoſo, as you call him, poor Man! was about Fifteen Years ago, when he gave me poſitive Orders to turn off an old Weeding-Woman that had been employed in the Family for ſeveral Years. He told me at the ſame Time, that there was no ſuch Thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a Weed, and that it was his Deſign to let his Garden produce what it pleaſed; ſo that you may be ſure it makes a very pleaſant Show as it now lies. About the ſame Time he took a Humour to ramble up and down the Country, and would often bring Home with him his Pockets full of Moſs and Pebbles. This you may be ſure gave me a heavy Heart; though at the ſame Time I muſt needs ſay, he had the Character of a very honeſt Man, notwithſtanding he was reckon'd a little weak, till he begun to ſell his Eſtate, and buy thoſe ſtrange Baubles that you have taken Notice of. Upon <hi>Midſummer-Day</hi> laſt, as he was walking with me in the Fields, he ſaw a very odd coloured Butterfly juſt before us. I obſerved, that he immediately chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Colour, like a Man that is ſurpriſed with a Piece of good Luck, and telling me that it was what he had looked for above theſe Twelve Years, he threw off his Coat, and followed it. I loſt Sight of them both in leſs than a quarter of an Hour; but my Husband continued the Chace over Hedge and Ditch till about Sun-ſet; at which Time, as I was afterwards told, he caught the Butterfly, as ſhe reſted her ſelf upon a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, near Five Miles from the Place where he firſt put her up. He was here lifted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0397200204:153"/>
from the Ground by ſome Paſſengers in a very fainting Condition, and brought Home to me about Midnight. His violent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe threw him into a Fever, which grew upon him by Degrees, and at laſt carried him off. In one of the Intervals of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, he called to me, and after having excuſed himſelf for running out of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, he told me, That he had always been more induſtrious to improve his Mind than his Fortune; and that his Family muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther value themſelves upon his Memory as he was a wiſe Man, than a rich one. He then told me, That it was a Cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> for a Man to give his Slaves their Liberty when he lay upon his Death-Bed. I could not imagine what this meant, till after having a little compoſed himſelf, he ordered me to bring him a Flea which he had kept for ſeveral Months in a Chain, with a Deſign, as he ſaid, to give it its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſſion. This was done accordingly. He then made the Will, which I have ſince ſeen printed in your Works Word for Word. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I muſt take Notice, that you have omitted the Codicil, in which he left a large <hi>Concha Veneris,</hi> as it is there called, to a Member of the Royal Society, who was often with him in his Sickneſs, and aſſiſted him in his Will. And now, Sir, I come to the chief Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of my Letter, which is, to deſire your Friendſhip and Aſſiſtance in the Diſpoſal of thoſe many Rarities and Curioſities which lie upon my Hands. If you know any one that has an Occaſion for a Parcel of dry'd Spiders, I will ſell them a Pennyworth. I could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let any one have a Bargain of Cockle-Shells. I would alſo deſire your Advice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had beſt ſell my Beetles in a Lump, or by Retail. The Gentleman above-mentioned,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0397200204:154"/>
who was my Husband's Friend, would have me make an Auction of all his Goods, and is now drawing up a Catalogue of every Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for that Purpoſe, with the Two following Words in great Letters over the Head of them, <hi>Auctio Gimcrackiana.</hi> But upon talking with him, I begin to ſuſpect he is as mad as poor Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> was.

               <p>In Anſwer to this moſt unfortunate Lady, I muſt acquaint her, That there is now in Town an ingenious Phyſician of my Acquaintance, who undertakes to cure all the Vices and Defects of the Mind by inward Medicines, or outward Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I ſhall give the World an Account of his Patients and his Cures in other Papers, when I ſhall be more at Leiſure to treat upon this Subject. I ſhall only here inform my Correſpondent, That for the Benefit of ſuch Ladies that are troubled with virulent Tongues, he has prepared a Cold Bath, over which there is faſtened, at the End of a long Pole, a very convenient Chair, curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gilt and carved. When the Patient is ſeated in this Chair, the Doctor lifts up the Pole, and gives her Two or Three total Emerſions in the Cold Bath, till ſuch Time as ſhe has quite loſt the Uſe of Speech. This Operation ſo effectually chills the Tongue, and refrigerates the Blood, that a Woman, who at her Entrance into the Chair is extreamly paſſionate and ſonorous, will come out as ſilent and gentle as a Lamb. The Doctor told me, he would not practiſe this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment upon Women of Faſhion, had not he ſeen it made upon thoſe of meaner Condition with very good Effect.</p>

               <p>WHereas by Letters from <hi>Nottingham</hi> we have Advice, That the young Ladies of that Place complain for Want of Sleep, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of certain riotous Lovers, who for this laſt Summer have very much infeſted the Streets of that eminent City with Violins and Baſs-Viols, between the Hours of Twelve and Four in the Morning, to the great Diſturbance of many of Her Majeſty's peaceable Subjects. And whereas I have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned to publiſh ſome Edict againſt theſe Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night Alarms, which, under the Name of Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades, do greatly annoy many well-diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not only in the Place above-mentioned, but alſo in moſt of the Polite Towns of this Iſland.</p>
               <p>I have taken that Matter into my ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and do find, that this Cuſtom is by no means to be indulged in this Country and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p>It is indeed very unaccountable, that moſt of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Youth ſhould take ſuch great Delight in theſe Nocturnal Expeditions. Your robuſt true-born <hi>Briton,</hi> that has not yet felt the Force of Flames and Darts, has a natural Inclination to break Windows; while th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0397200204:157"/>
them to utter their Complaints: For as the Cuſtom prevails at preſent, there is ſcarce a young Man of any Faſhion in a Corporation who does not make Love with the Town-Muſick. The Waits often help him through his Courtſhip; and my Friend Mr. <hi>Baniſter</hi> has told me, he was proffered Five hundred Pounds by a young Fellow to play, but for one Winter under the Window of a Lady that was a great Fortune, but more cruel than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. One would think they hoped to conquer their Miſtreſſes Hearts as People tame Hawks and Eagles, by keeping them awake, or breaking their Sleep when they are fallen into it.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to ſearch into the Original of this impertinent Way of making Love, which, according to ſome Authors, is of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. If we may believe Monſieur <hi>Dacier and</hi> other Criticks, <hi>Horace</hi>'s Tenth Ode of the Third Book was originally a Serenade. And if I was diſpoſed to ſhow my Learning, I could produce a Line of him in another Place, which ſeems to have been the Burthen of an old Heathen Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade.</p>

               <p>But notwithſtanding the Opinions of many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men upon this Subject, I rather agree with them who look upon this Cuſtom, as now practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to have been introduced by caſtrated Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who found out this Way of applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Miſtreſſes at theſe Hours, when Men of hoarſer Voices expreſs their Paſſions in a more vulgar Method. It muſt be confeſſed, That your <hi>Italian</hi> Eunuchs do practiſe this Manner of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to this Day.</p>
               <p>But whoever were the Perſons that firſt thought of the Serenade, the Authors of all Countries are unanimous in aſcribing the invention to <hi>Italy.</hi>

There are Two Circumſtances which qualified that Country above all other for this Midnight Muſick.</p>
               <p>The firſt I ſhall mention, was the Softneſs of their Climate.</p>
               <p>This gave the Lover Opportunities of being Abroad in the Air, or of lying upon the Earth whole Hours together, without Fear of Damps or Dews; but as for our Tramontain Lovers, when they begin their Midnight Complaint with,
<q>
                     <l>My Lodging it is on the cold Ground,</l>
                  </q> We are not to underſtand them in the Rigour of the Letter, ſince it would be impoſſible for a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Swain to condole himſelf long in that Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without really dying for his Miſtreſs. A Man might as well ſerenade in <hi>Greenland</hi> as in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>Milton</hi> ſeems to have had in his Thoughts the Abſurdity of theſe Northern Serenades in the Cenſure which he paſſes upon them:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Or Midnight Ball,</l>
                  <l>Or Serenede, which the Starv'd Lover ſings</l>
                  <l>To his proud Fair, beſt quitted with Diſdain.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The Truth of it is, I have often pitied, in a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Night, a Vocal Muſician, and have attributed many of his Trills and Quavers to the Coldneſs of the Weather.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Circumſtance which inclined the <hi>Lalians</hi> to this Cuſtom, was that Muſical Genius which is ſo univerſal among them. Nothing is more frequent in that Country, than to hear a Cobler working to an Opera Tune. You can ſcarce ſee a Porter that has not one Nail much longer than the reſt, which you will find, upon Enquiry, is cheriſhed for ſome Inſtrument. In ſhort, there is not a Labourer, or Handicraft Man, that in the Cool of the Evening does not relieve himſelf with Solo's and Sonnata's.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0397200204:159"/>
The <hi>Italian</hi> fooths his Miſtreſs with a plaintivee Voice, and bewails himſelf in ſuch melting Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that the whole Neighbourhood ſympathizes with him in his Sorrow.</p>

               <p>On the contrary, our honeſt Countrymen have ſo little an Inclination to Muſick, that they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom begin to ſing till they are drunk, which alſo is uſually the Time when they are moſt diſpoſed to ſerenade.</p>

               <p>I HAVE been very much ſollicited by <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda, Flavia,</hi> and <hi>Lyſetta,</hi> to reaſſume my Diſcourſe concerning the Methods of diſpoſing honourably the unmarried Part of the World, and taking off thoſe Bars to it, Jointures and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are not only the greateſt Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards entring into that State, but alſo the frequent Cauſes of Diſturſt and Animoſity in it after it is conſummated. I have with very much Attention conſider'd the Caſe; and among all the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0397200204:160"/>
Obſervations that I have made thro' a long Courſe of Years, I have thought the Coldneſs of Wives to their Husbands, as well as Diſreſpect from Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Parents, to ariſe from this one Source. This Trade for Minds and Bodies in the Lump, without Regard to either, but as they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch Sums of Money, and ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceis of Land, cannot but produce a Commerce between the Parties concerned ſuitable to the mean Motives upon which they at firſt came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I have heretofore given an Account, that this Method of making Settlements, was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a griping Lawyer, who made Uſe of the covetous Tempers of the Parents of each Side to force Two young People into theſe vile Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Diffidence, for no other End but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Skins of Parchment, by which they were put into each other's Poſſeſſion out of each other's Power. The Law of our Country has given an ample and generous Proviſion for the Wife, even the Third of the Husband's Eſtate, and left to her good Humour and his Gratitude the Expectation of further Proviſion; but the fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Method of going further, with relation to their Heirs, has a Foundation in nothing but Pride and Folly: For as all Men wiſh their Children as like themſelves, and as much better as they can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, it ſeems monſtrous, that we ſhould give out of our ſelves the Opportunities of rewarding and diſcouraging them according to their Deſerts. This wiſe Inſtitution has no more Senſe in it, than if a Man ſhould begin a Deed with, <q rend="inline">"Whereas no Man living knows how long he ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be a reaſonable Creature, or an honeſt Man: And whereas I <hi>B.</hi> am going to enter in the State of Matrimony with Mrs. <hi>D.</hi> therefore I ſhall from henceforth make it indifferent to me, whether from this Time forward I ſhall be a Fool or a Knave: And therefore in full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0397200204:161"/>
Health of Body, and as ſound Mind, not knowing which of my Children will prove bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe, I give to my Firſt-born, be he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, ungrateful, impious, or cruel, the Lump and Bulk of my Eſtate, and leave one Year's Purchaſe only to each of my younger Children, whether they ſhall be brave or beautiful, modeſt or honourable, from the Time of the Date hereof wherein I reſign my Senſes, and hereby promiſe to employ my Judgment no further in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of my Worldly Goods from the Day of the Date hereof, hereby further confeſſing and covenanting, that I am from henceforth married, and dead in Law.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is no Man that is converſant in modern Settlements, but knows this is an exact Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is inſerted in theſe Inſtruments. Men's Paſſions could only make them ſubmit to ſuch Terms; and therefore all unreaſonable Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains in Marriage ought to be ſet aſide, as well as Deeds extorted from Men under Force or in Priſon, who are altogether as much Maſters of their Actions as he that is poſſeſs'd with a violent Paſſion.</p>
               <p>How ſtrangely Men are ſometimes partial to themſelves, appears by the Rapine of him that has a Daughter's Beauty under his Direction. He will make no Scruple of uſing it to force from her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as much of his Eſtate as is worth 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and at the ſame Time, as a Juſtice on the Bench, will ſpare no Pains to get a Man hanged that has taken but a Horſe from him.</p>
               <p>It is to be hoped, the Legiſlature will in due Time take this Kind of Robbery into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not ſuffer Men to prey upon each other, when they are about making the moſt ſolemn League, and entring into the ſtricteſt Bonds. The only ſure Remedy is to fix a certain Rate on every Woman's Fortune; one Price for that of a Maid,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0397200204:162"/>
and another for a Widow: For it is of infinite Advantage, that there ſhould be no Frauds or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties in the Sale of our Women.</p>
               <p>If any Man ſhould exceed the ſettled Rate, he ought to be at Liberty after Seven Years are over, by which Time his Love may be ſuppoſed to abate a little, if it is not founded upon Reaſon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Bargain, and be freed from the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon reſtoring the Portion; as a Youth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under Fourteen Years old may be off if he pleaſes when he comes to that Age, and as a Man is diſcharged from all Bargains but that of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage made when he is under Twenty one.</p>
               <p>It grives me when I conſider, that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon Matrimony take away the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we ſhould otherwiſe have over other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which are ſunk much by thoſe great Checks upon Propagation, the Convents. It is thought chiefly owing to theſe that <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> want above half their Complement of People. Were the Price of Wives always fixed and ſettled, it would contribute to filling the Nation more than all the Encouragements that can poſſibly be given to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to tranſplant themſelves hither.</p>
               <p>I therefore, as Cenſor of <hi>Britain,</hi> till a Law is made, will lay down Rules which ſhall be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Penalty of degrading all that break them into Pretty Fellows, Smarts, Squibs, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Horns, Drums, and Bagpipes.</p>
               <p>The Females that are guilty of breaking my Orders, I ſhall reſpectively pronounce to be Kits, Hornpipes, Dulcimers, and Kettle-Drums. Such Widows as wear the Spoils of one Husband I will bury, if they attempt to rob another.</p>
               <p>I ordain, That no Woman ever demand one Shilling to be paid after her Husband's Death, more than the very Sum ſhe brings him, or an Equivalent for it in Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0397200204:163"/>
That no Settlement be made, in which the Man ſettles on his Children more than the Reverſion of the Jointure, or the Value of it in Money; ſo that at his Death he may in the Whole be bound to pay his Family but double to what he has receiv'd. I would have the eldeſt, as well as the reſt, have his Proviſion out of this.</p>
               <p>When Men are not able to come up to thoſe Settlements I have propoſed, I would have them receive ſo much of the Portion only as they can come up to, and the reſt to go to the Woman by Way of Pin-Money, or Separate Maintenance. In this, I think, I determined equally between the Two Sexes.</p>
               <p>If any Lawyer varies from theſe Rules, or is above Two Days in drawing a Marriage Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or uſes more Words in it than one Skin of Parchment will contain, or takes above Five Pounds for drawing it, I would have him thrown over the Bar.</p>
               <p>Were theſe Rules obſerved, a Woman with a ſmall Fortune, and a great deal of Worth, would be ſure to marry according to her Deſerts, if the Man's Eſtate were to be leſs incumbered in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as her Fortune is leſs than he might have with others.</p>
               <p>A Man of a great deal of Merit, and not much Eſtate, might be choſen for his Worth; becauſe it would not be difficult for him to make a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Man that loves a Woman beſt, would not loſe her for not being able to bid ſo much as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or for not complying with an extravagant Demand.</p>
               <p>A fine Woman would no more be ſet up to Auction as ſhe is now. When a Man puts in for her, her Friends or her ſelf take Care to publiſh it; and the Man that was the firſt Bidder is made no other Uſe of but to raiſe the Price. He that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0397200204:164"/>
loves her, will continue in Waiting as long as ſhe pleaſes, (if her Fortune be thought equal to his) and under Pretence of ſome Failure in the Rent-Roll, or Difficulties in drawing the Settlement, he is put off till a better Bargain is made with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>All the reſt of the Sex that are not rich or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the higheſt Degree are plainly Gainers, and would be married ſo faſt, that the leaſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them would ſoon grow Beauties to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors.</p>
               <p>Widows might be eaſily married, if they would not, as they do now, ſet up for diſcreet, only by being mercenary.</p>
               <p>The making Matimony cheap and eaſy, would be the greateſt Diſcouragement to Vice: The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the Expence of Children would not make Men ill inclined, or afraid of having them in a regular Way; and the Men of Merit would not live unmarried, as they often do now, becauſe the Goodneſs of a Wife cannot be enſured to them; out the Loſs of an Eſtate is certain, and a Man would never have the Affliction of a worthleſs Heir added to that of a bad Wife.</p>
               <p>I am the more ſerious, large, and particular on this Subject, becauſe my Lucubrations deſigned for the Encouragement of Virtue, cannot have the deſired Succeſs as long as this Incumbrance of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements continues upon Matrimony.</p>

               <p>IT is my Cuſtom, in a Dearth of News, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain my ſelf with thoſe Collections of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements that appear at the End of all our publick Prints. Theſe I conſider as Accounts of News from the little World, in the ſame Manner that the foregoing Parts of the Paper are from the great. If in one we hear that a Sovereign Prince is fled from his Capital City, in the other we hear of a Tradeſman who hath ſhut up his Shop, and run away. If in one we find the Victory of a General, in the other we ſee the Deſertion of a private Soldier. I muſt confeſs, I have a certain Weakneſs in my Temper, that is often very much affected by theſe little Domeſtick Occurrences, and have frequently been caught with Tears in my Eyes over a melancholy Advertiſement.</p>
               <p>But to conſider this Subject in its moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Lights, Advertiſements are of great Uſe to the Vulgar: Firſt of all, as they are Inſtruments of Ambition. A Man that is by no Means big enough for the <hi>Gazette,</hi> may eaſily creep into the Advertiſements; by which Means we often ſee an Apothecary in the ſame Paper of News with a Plenipotentiary, or a Running-Footman with an Ambaſſador. An Advertiſement from <hi>Pickadilly</hi> goes down to Poſterity, with an Article from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid;</hi> and <hi>John Bartlett</hi> of <hi>Goodman's-Fields</hi> is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the ſame Paper with the Emperor of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0397200204:166"/>
                  <hi>Germany.</hi> Thus the Fable tells us, That the Wren mounted as high as the Eagle, by getting upon his Back.</p>
               <p>A Second Uſe which this Sort of Writings have been turned to of late Years, has been the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Controverſy, inſomuch that above half the Advertiſements one meets with now-a-Days are purely Polemical. The Inventors of <hi>Strops for Razors</hi> have written againſt one another this Way for ſeveral Years, and that with great Bitterneſs; as the whole Argument <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> in the Caſe of the <hi>Morning-Gowns</hi> is ſtill carried on after the ſame Manner. I need not mention the ſeveral Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Dr. <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Pills; nor take Notice of the many Satyrical Works of this Nature ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Clark,</hi> who has had the Confidence to advertiſe upon that learned Knight, my very worthy Friend, Sir <hi>William Read:</hi> But I ſhall not interpoſe in their Quarrel; Sir <hi>William</hi> can give him his own in Advertiſements, that, in the Judgment of the Impartial, are as well penn'd as the Doctor's.</p>
               <p>The Third and laſt Uſe of theſe Writings is, to inform the World where they may be furniſhed with almoſt every Thing that is neceſſary for Life. If a Man has Pains in his Head, Cholicks in his Bowels, or Spots in his Clothes, he may here meet with proper Cures and Remedies. If a Man would recover a Wife or a Horſe that is ſtolen or ſtray'd; if he wants new Sermons, Electuaries, Aſſes Milk, or any Thing elſe, either for his Body or his Mind, this is the Place to look for them in.</p>
               <p>The great Art in writing Advertiſements, is the finding out a proper Method to catch the Reader's Eye; without which, a good Thing may paſs over unobſerved, or be loſt among Commiſſions of Bankrupt. Aſterisks and Hands were formerly of great Uſe for this Purpoſe. Of late Years, the <hi>N. B.</hi> has been much in Faſhion; as alſo little Cuts and Figures, the Invention of which we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0397200204:167"/>
to the Author of Spring-Truſſes. I muſt not here omit the blind <hi>Italian</hi> Character, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce legible, always fixes and detains the Eye, and gives the curious Reader ſomething like the Satisfaction of prying into a Secret.</p>
               <p>But the great Skill in an Advertiſer is chiefly ſeen in the Style which he makes uſe of. He is to mention <hi>the univerſal Eſteem, or general Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of Things that were never heard of. If he is a Phyſician or Aſtrologer, he muſt change his Lodgings frequently, and (tho' he never ſaw any Body in them beſides his own Family) give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Notice of it, <hi>For the Information of the Nobility and Gentry.</hi> Since I am thus uſefully employ'd in writing Criticiſms on the Works of theſe diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authors, I muſt not paſs over in Silence an Advertiſement which has lately made its Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and is written altogether in a <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Manner. It was ſent to me, with Five Shillings, to be inſerted among my Advertiſements; but as it is a Pattern of good Writing in this Way, I ſhall give it a Place in the Body of my Paper.</p>
               <q>THE higheſt compounded Spirit of Lavender, the moſt glorious (if the Expreſſion may be uſed) enlivening Scent and Flavour that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, which ſo raptures the Spirits, delights the Guſt, and gives ſuch Airs to the Countenance, as are not to be imagined but by thoſe that have tried it. The meaneſt Sort of the Thing is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by moſt Gentlemen and Ladies; but this far more, as by far it exceeds it, to the gaining among all a more than common Eſteem. It is ſold (in neat Flint Bottles fit for the Pocket) only at the Golden-Key in Warton's-Court near Holborn-Bars, for 3 s. 6 d. with Directions.</q>
               <p>At the ſame Time that I recommend the ſeveral Flowers in which this Spirit of Lavender is wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, (if the Expreſſion may be uſed) I cannot
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0397200204:168"/>
excuſe my Fellow-Labourers for admitting into their Papers ſeveral uncleanly Advertiſements, not at all proper to appear in the Works of polite Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Among theſe I muſt reckon the <hi>Carminitive Wind expelling</hi> Pills. If the Doctor had called them only his Carminitive Pills, he had been as cleanly as one could have wiſhed; but the Second Word entirely deſtroys the Decency of the Firſt. There are other Abſurdities of this Nature ſo very groſs, that I dare not mention them; and ſhall therefore diſmiſs this Subject with a publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to <hi>Michael Parrot,</hi> That he do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume any more to mention a certain Worm he knows of, which, by the Way, has grown Seven Foot in my Memory; for, if I am not much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, it is the ſame that was but Nine Foot long about Six Months ago.</p>
               <p>By the Remarks I have here made, it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that a Collection of Advertiſements is a kind of Miſcellany; the Writers of which, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Authors, except Men of Quality, give Money to the Bookſellers who publiſh their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. The Genius of the Bookſeller is chiefly ſhown in his Method of ranging and digeſting theſe little Tracts. The laſt Paper I took up in my Hands, places them in the following Order:<list>

               <p>THE Hours which we ſpend in Converſation are the moſt pleaſing of any which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; yet, methinks, there is very little Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to improve our ſelves for the frequent Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of them. The common Fault in this Caſe, is that of growing too intimate, and falling into diſpleaſing Familiarities: For it is a very ordinary Thing for Men to make no other Uſe of a cloſe Acquaintance with each other's Affairs, but to teaze one another with unacceptable Alluſions. One would paſs over patiently ſuch as converſe like Animals, and ſalute each other with Bangs on the Shoulder, ſly Raps with Canes, or other robuſt Pleaſantries practiſed by the rural Gentry of this Nation: But even among thoſe who ſhould have more polite Idea's of Things, you ſee a Set of People who invert the Deſign of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make frequent Mention of ungrateful Subjects; nay, mention them becauſe they are ungrateful; as if the Perfection of Society were in knowing how to offend on the one Part, and how to bear an Offence on the other. In all Parts of this populous Town you find the merry World made up of an active and a paſſive Companion; one who has good-nature enough to ſuffer all his Friend ſhall think fit to ſay, and one who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make the moſt of his Good-humour to ſhow his Parts. In the Trading Part of Mankind,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0397200204:170"/>
I have ever obſerved the Jeſt went by the Weight of Purſes, and the Ridicule is made up by the Gains which ariſe from it. Thus the Packer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Clothier to ſay what he pleaſes, and the Broker has his Countenance ready to laugh with the Merchant, tho' the Abuſe is to fall on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he knows that, as a Go-between, he ſhall find his Account in being in the good Graces of a Man of Wealth. Among theſe juſt and punctual People, the richeſt Man is ever the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jeſter; and they know no ſuch Thing as a Perſon who ſhall pretend to a ſuperior Laugh at a Man, who does not make him Amends by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Advantage in another Kind: But among People of a different Way, where the pretended Diſtinction in Company is only what is raiſed from Senſe and Underſtanding, it is very abſurd to carry on a rough Raillery ſo far, as that the whole Diſcourſe ſhould turn upon each others Infirmities, Follies, or Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>I was this Evening with a Set of Wags of this Claſs. They appear generally by Two and Two; and what is moſt extraordinary, is, that thoſe very Perſons who are moſt together, appear leaſt of a Mind when joined by other Company. This Evil proceeds from an indiſcreet Familiarity, whereby a Man is allowed to ſay the moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Thing imaginable to another, and it ſhall be accounted Weakneſs to ſhow an Impatience for the Unkindneſs. But this and all other Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Deſign of pleaſing each other when we meet, are derived from Interlopers in Society, who want Capacity to put in a Stock among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Companions, and therefore ſupply their Wants by ſtale Hiſtories, ſly Obſervations, and rude Hints, which relate to the Conduct of others. All Cohabitants in general run into this unhappy Fault; Men and their Wives break into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which are like ſo much <hi>Arabick</hi> to the reſt of the Company; Siſters and Brothers often
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0397200204:171"/>
make the like Figure from the ſame unjuſt Senſe of the Art of being intimate and familiar. It is often ſaid, ſuch an one cannot ſtand the Mention of ſuch a Circumſtance: If he cannot, I am ſure it is for Want of Diſcourſe, or a worſe Reaſon, that any Companion of his touches upon it.</p>
               <p>Familiarity, among the truly Well-bred, never give Authority to treſpaſs upon one another in the moſt minute Circumſtance, but it allows to be kinder than we ought otherwiſe preſume to be. <hi>Euſebius</hi> has Wit, Humour, and Spirit; but there never was a Man in his Company who wiſhed he had leſs, for he underſtands Familiarity ſo well, that he knows how to make Uſe of it in a Way that neither makes himſelf or his Friend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; but if any one is leſſened by his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it is he himſelf, who always likes the Place, the Diet, and the Reception, when he is in the Company of his Friends. Equality is the Life of Converſation; and he is as much out who aſſumes to himſelf any Part above another, as he who conſiders himſelf below the reſt of the Society. Familiarity in Inferiors is Saucineſs; in Superiors, Condeſcenſion; neither of which are to have Being among Companions, the very Word implying that they are to be equal. When therefore we have abſtracted the Company from all Conſiderations of their Quality or Fortune, it will immediately appear, that to make it happy and polite, there muſt nothing be ſtarted which ſhall diſcover that our Thoughts run upon any ſuch Diſtinctions. Hence it will ariſe, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence muſt become the Rule of Society, and he that is moſt obliging, muſt be moſt diverting.</p>
               <p>This Way of Talking I am fallen into from the Reflection that I am wherever I go entertained with ſome Abſurdity, Miſtake, Weakneſs, or ill Luck of ſome Man or other, whom not only I, but the Perſon who makes me thoſe Relations has a Value for. It would therefore be a great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0397200204:172"/>
to the World, if it could be brought to paſs that no Story ſhould be a taking one, but what was to the Advantage of the Perſon of whom it is related. By this Means, he that is now a Wit in Converſation, would be conſidered as a Sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of falſe News is in Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But above all, to make a Familiar fit for a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Friend, it is abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould always be inclined rather to hide than rally each others Infirmities. To ſuffer for a Fault, is a Sort of Attonement; and no Body is concerned for the Offence for which he has made Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>I Here make bold to trouble you with a ſhort Account of the famous Dr. <hi>Young</hi>'s Life, which you may call (if you pleaſe) a Second Part of the Farce of the <hi>Sham Doctor.</hi> This perhaps will not ſeem ſo ſtrange to you, who (if I am not miſtaken) have ſomewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with Honour your Siſter <hi>Kirleus</hi> as a Practitioner both in Phyſick and Aſtrology: But in the common Opinion of Mankind, a She-Quack is altogether as ſtrange and aſtoniſhing a Creature as the Centaur that practis'd Phyſick in the Days of <hi>Achilles,</hi> or as King <hi>Phys</hi> in the <hi>Rehearſal. Aeſculapius,</hi> the great Founder of your Art, was particularly famous for his Beard, as we may conclude from the Behaviour of a Tyrant, who is branded by Heathen Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians as guilty both of Sacrilege and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, having robbed the Statue of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> of a thick buſhy Golden Beard, and then alledged for his Excuſe, <hi>That it was a Shame the Son ſhould have a Beard when his Father</hi> Apollo <hi>had none.</hi> This latter Inſtance indeed ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to favour a Female Profeſſor, ſince (as I have been told) the ancient Statues of <hi>Apollo</hi> are generally made with the Head and Face of a Woman: Nay, I have been credibly informed by thoſe who have ſeen them both, that the famous <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Belvidera</hi> did very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Dr. <hi>Young.</hi> Let that be as it will, the Doctor was a Kind of <hi>Amazon</hi> in Phyſick, that made as great Devaſtations and Slaughters as any of our chief Heroes in the Art, and was as fatal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in theſe our Days, as the famous <hi>Jean d' Arc</hi> was in thoſe of our Forefathers.</p>
                     <p>I do not find any Thing remarkable in the Life I am about to write till the Year 1695, at
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0397200204:175"/>
which Time the Doctor, being about Twenty three Years old, was brought to Bed of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Child. The Scandal of ſuch a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave ſo great Uneaſineſs to pretty Mrs. <hi>Peg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> (for that was the Name by which the Doctor was then called) that ſhe left her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and followed her Lover to <hi>London,</hi> with a fixed Reſolution ſome Way or other to recover her loſt Reputation: But inſtead of changing her Life, which one would have expected from ſo good a Diſpoſition of Mind, ſhe took it in her Head to change her Sex. This was ſoon done by the Help of a Sword and a Pair of Breeches. I have Reaſon to believe, that her firſt Deſign was to turn Man-Midwife, having her ſelf had ſome Experience in thoſe Affairs: But thinking this too narrow a Foundation for her future Fortune, ſhe at length bought her a Gold Button Coat, and ſet up for a Phyſician. Thus we ſee the ſame fatal Miſcarriage in her Youth made Mrs. <hi>Young</hi> a Doctor, that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made one of the ſame Sex a Pope.</p>
                     <p>The Doctor ſucceeded very well in his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at firſt, but very often met with Accidents that diſquieted him. As he wanted that deep magiſterial Voice which gives Authority to a Preſcription, and is abſolutely neceſſary for the right Pronouncing of thoſe Words, <hi>Take theſe Pills,</hi> he unfortunately got the Nickname of the <hi>Squeaking Doctor.</hi> If this Circumſtance alarmed the Doctor, there was another that gave him no ſmall Diſquiet, and very much diminiſhed his Gains. In ſhort, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf run down as a ſuperficial prating Quack, in all Families that had at the Head of them a cautious Father, or a jealous Husband. Theſe would often complain among one another, that they did not like ſuch a Smock-faced Phyſician; though in Truth had they known how juſtly he deſerved that Name, they would rather have
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0397200204:176"/>
favoured his Practice, than have apprehended any Thing from it.</p>
                     <p>Such were the Motives that determined Mrs. <hi>Young</hi> to change her Condition, and take in Marriage a virtuous young Woman, who lived with her in good Reputation, and made her the Father of a very pretty Girl. But this Part of her Happineſs was ſoon after deſtroyed by a Diſtemper which was too hard for our Phyſician, and carried off his firſt Wife. The Doctor had not been a Widow long, before he married his Second Lady, with whom alſo he lived in very good Underſtanding. It ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the Doctor was with Child at the ſame Time that his Lady was; but the little ones coming both together, they paſſed for Twins. The Doctor having entirely eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reputation of his Manhood, eſpecially by the Birth of the Boy of whom he had been lately delivered, and who very much reſembles him, grew into good Buſineſs, and was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly famous for the Cure of Venereal Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; but would have had much more Practice among his own Sex, had not ſome of them been ſo unreaſonable as to demand certain Proofs of their Cure, which the Doctor was not able to give them. The florid blooming Look, which gave the Doctor ſome Uneaſineſs at firſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of betraying his Perſon, only recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Phyſick. Upon this Occaſion I cannot forbear mentioning what I thought a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Surprize in one of <hi>Moliere</hi>'s Plays, where a young Woman applies her ſelf to a ſick Perſon in the Habit of a Quack, and ſpeaks to her Patient, who was ſomething ſcandalized at the Youth of his Phyſician, to the following Purpoſe—<hi>I begun to practiſe in the Reign of</hi> Francis I. <hi>and am now in the Hundred and fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year of my Age; but, by the Vertue of my Medicaments, have maintained my ſelf in the</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0397200204:177"/>
                        <hi>ſame Beauty and Freſhneſs I had at Fifteen.</hi> For this Reaſon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lays it down as a Rule, That a Student in Phyſick ſhould have a ſound Conſtitution, and a healthy Look; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeem as neceſſary Qualifications for a Phyſician, as a good Life, and virtuous Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for a Divine. But to return to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. About Two Years ago the Doctor was very much afflicted with the Vapours, which grew upon him to ſuch a Degree, that about ſix Weeks ſince they made an End of him. His Death diſcovered the Diſguiſe he had acted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and brought him back again to his former Sex. 'Tis ſaid, that at his Burial the Pall was held up by Six Women of ſome Faſhion. The Doctor left behind him a Widow, and Two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs Children, if they may be called ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the little Boy before-mentioned. In rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom we may ſay of the Doctor, as the good old Ballad about <hi>The Children in the Wood</hi> ſays of the Unnatural Unkle, that he was Father and Mother both in one. Theſe are all the Circumſtances that I could learn of Doctor <hi>Young</hi>'s Life, which might have given Occaſion to many obſcene Fictions: But as I know thoſe would never have gained a Place in your Paper, I have not troubled you with any Impertinence of that Nature; having ſtuck to the Truth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcrupulouſly, as I always do when I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <p>IT is the Buſineſs of Reaſon and Philoſophy to ſooth and allay the Paſſions of the Mind, or turn them to a vigorous Proſecution of what is dictated by the Underſtanding. In order to this good End, I would keep a watchful Eye upon the growing Inclinations of Youth, and be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly careful to prevent their indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch Sentiments as may imbitter their more advanced Age. I have now under Cure a young Gentleman, who lately communicated to me, that he was of all Men living the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably envious. I deſired the Circumſtances of his Diſtemper; upon which, with a Sigh that would have moved the moſt inhumane Breaſt, <q rend="inline">'Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> ſaid he, I am Nephew to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a very great Eſtate, to whoſe Favour I have a Couſin that has equal Pretenſions with my ſelf. This Kinſman of mine is a young Man of the higheſt Merit imaginable, and has a Mind ſo tender, and ſo generous, that I can obſerve he returns my Envy with Pity. He makes me upon all Occaſions the moſt obliging Condeſcenſions: And I cannot but take Notice of the Concern he is in to ſee my Life blaſted with this racking Paſſion, though it is againſt himſelf. In the Preſence of my Unkle, when I am in the Room, he never ſpeaks ſo well as he is capable of, but always lowers his Talents and Accompliſhments out of Regard to me.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0397200204:180"/>
Temper, that renders him unwilling to be pleas'd with any Thing without him that has either Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Perfection in it. I look upon it as a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Mind, (which I know no Moraliſt that has deſcribed in this Light) when a Man cannot diſcern any Thing which another is Maſter of that is agreeable. For which Reaſon, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good-natured Man to be endowed with a certain diſcerning Faculty which the Envious are altogether deprived of. Shallow Wits, ſuperficial Criticks, and conceited Fops, are with me ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blind Men in reſpect of Excellencies. They can behold nothing but Faults and Blemiſhes, and indeed ſee nothing that is worth ſeeing. Show them a Poem, it is Stuff; a Picture, it is Daubing. They find nothing in Architecture that is not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, or in Muſick that is not out of Tune. Theſe Men ſhould conſider, that it is their Envy which deforms every Thing, and that the Ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not in the Object, but in the Eye. And as for nobler Minds, whoſe Merits are either not diſcovered, or are miſrepreſented by the envious Part of Mankind, they ſhould rather conſider their Defamers with Pity than Indignation. A Man cannot have an Idea of Perfection in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he was never ſenſible of in himſelf. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> tells us, That upon asking a blind Man, What he thought Scarlet was? He anſwered, That he believed it was like the Sound of a Trumpet. He was forced to form his Conceptions of Idea's which he had not, by thoſe which he had. In the ſame Manner, ask an envious Man, What he thinks of Virtue? He will call it Deſign: What of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature? And he will term it Dulneſs. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, That as the Perſon before-mentioned was born blind, your envious Men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Diſtemper themſelves, and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Sort of an acquired Blindneſs. Thus the Devil in <hi>Milton,</hi> tho' made an Angel of Light, could ſee nothing to pleaſe him even in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0397200204:181"/>
and hated our Firſt Parents, though in their State of Innocence.</p>

Sir, would you give us in one of your <hi>Tatlers</hi> the Original and Progreſs of Smock-Simony, and ſhew us, that where the Laws are ſilent, Men's Conſciences ought to be ſo too; you could not more oblige our Fraternity of young Divines, and among the reſt,</p>

               <p>I am very proud of having a Gentleman of this Name for my Admirer, and may ſome Time or other write ſuch a Treatiſe as he mentions. In the mean Time I do not ſee why our Clergy, who are very frequently Men of good Families, ſhould be reproached, if any of them chance to eſpouſe a Hand-Maid with a Rectory in <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſince the beſt of our Peers have often join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the Daughters of very ordinary Tradeſmen upon the ſame valuable Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

You know very well, that in our ordinary Almanacks the Wind and Rain, Snow and Hail, Clouds and Sun-ſhine, have their proper Seaſons, and come up as regularly

in their ſeveral Months as the Fruits and Plants of the Earth. As for my own Part, I freely own to you, that I generally ſteal my Weather out of ſome antiquated Almanack, that foretold it ſeveral Years ago. Now, Sir, what I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg of you is, that you would lend me your State Weather-Glaſs, in order to fill up this vacant Column in my Works. This, I know, would ſell my Almanack beyond any other, and make me a richer Man than <hi>Poor Robin.</hi> If you will not grant me this Favour, I muſt have Recourſe to my old Method, and will copy after an Almanack which I have by me, and which I think was made for the Year when the great Storm was. I am,</p>

               <p>This Gentleman does not conſider, what a ſtrange Appearance his Almanack would make to the Ignorant, ſhould he tranſpoſe his Weather, as he muſt do, did he follow the Dictates of my Glaſs.

The Firſt is for a Gentleman, who would willingly marry, if he could find a Wife to his Liking; the Second is for a poor Whig, who is lately turned out of his Poſt; and the Third for a Perſon of a contrary Party, who is willing to get into one.</p>

               <p>THE whole Creation preys upon it ſelf: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very living Creature is inhabited. A Flea has a Thouſand inviſible Inſects that teaze him as he jumps from Place to Place, and revenge our Quarrels upon him. A very ordinary Microſcope ſhows us, that a Louſe is it ſelf a very louſy Creature. A Whale, beſides thoſe Seas and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans in the ſeveral Veſſels of his Body, which are filled with innumerable Shoals of little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, carries about it a whole World of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; inſomuch that, if we believe the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome have made, there are more living Creatures which are too ſmall for the naked Eye to behold about the Leviathan, than there are of viſible Creatures upon the Face of the whole Earth. Thus every nobler Creature is as it were the Baſis and Support of Multitudes that are his Inferiors.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0397200204:191"/>
able to underſtand it? The firſt Thing that ſtrikes your Eye, is the <hi>Breaks</hi> at the End of almoſt every Sentence, of which I know not the Uſe, only that it is a Refinement, and very frequently practiſed. Then you will obſerve the Abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Eliſions, by which Conſonants of moſt obdurate Sound are joined together, without one ſoftening Vowel to intervene; and all this only to make one Syllable of Two, directly contrary to the Example of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Strain, and a natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards relapſing into Barbarity, which delights in Monoſyllables, and uniting of Mute Conſonants, as it is obſervable in all the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Languages. And this is ſtill more viſible in the next Refinement, which conſiſts in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the firſt Syllable in a Word that has many, and diſmiſſing the reſt; ſuch as <hi>Phizz, Hipps, Mobb, Pozz, Rep,</hi> and many more, when we are already overloaded with Monoſyllables, which are the Diſgrace of our Language. Thus we cram one Syllable, and cut off the reſt, as the Owl fattened her Mice after ſhe had bit off their Legs, to prevent them from running away; and if ours be the ſame Reaſon for maiming our Words, it will certainly anſwer the End, for I am ſure no other Nation will deſire to borrow them. Some Words are hitherto but fairly ſplit, and therefore only in their Way to Perfection; as <hi>Incog,</hi> and <hi>Plenipo:</hi> But in a ſhort Time, 'tis to be hoped, they will be further dock'd to <hi>Inc.</hi> and <hi>Plen.</hi> This Reflection has made me of late Years very impatient for a Peace, which I believe would ſave the Lives of many brave Words, as well as Men. The War has introduced abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Polyſyllables, which will never be able to live many more Campaigns. <hi>Speculations, Operations, Preliminaries, Ambaſſadors, Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Communication, Circumvallation, Battalions,</hi> as numerous as they are, if they attack us too
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0397200204:192"/>
frequently in our Coffee-houſes, we ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put them to Flight, and cut off the Rear.</p>
                     <p>The Third Refinement obſervable in the Letter I ſend you, conſiſts in the Choice of certain Words invented by ſome <hi>pretty Fellows,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Banter, Bamboozle, Country Put,</hi> and <hi>Kidney,</hi> as it is there applied, ſome of which are now ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling for the Vogue, and others are in Poſſeſſion of it. I have done my utmoſt for ſome Years paſt to ſtop the Progreſs of <hi>Mobb</hi> and <hi>Banter,</hi> but have been plainly born down by Numbers, and betrayed by thoſe who promiſed to aſſiſt me.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt Place, you are to take Notice of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain choice Phraſes ſcattered through the Letter, ſome of them tolerable enough, till they were worn to Rags by ſervile Imitators. You might eaſily find them, though they were not in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Print, and therefore I need not diſturb them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the falſe Refinements in our Style which you ought to correct: Firſt, by Argument and fair Means; but if thoſe fail, I think you are to make Uſe of your Authority as Cenſor, and by an Annual <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> expunge all Words and Phraſes that are offenſive to good Senſe, and condemn thoſe barbarous Mutilations of Vowels and Syllables. In this laſt Point, the uſual Pretence is, That they ſpell as they ſpeak: A noble Standard for Language! To depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caprice of every Coxcomb, who becauſe Words are the Cloathing of our Thoughts, cuts them out and ſhapes them as he pleaſes, and changes them oftner than his Dreſs. I believe all reaſonable People would be content that ſuch Refiners were more ſparing in their Words, and liberal in their Syllables: And upon this Head, I ſhould be glad you would beſtow ſome Advice upon ſeveral young Readers in our Churches, who coming up from the Univerſity full fraight
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0397200204:193"/>
with Admiration of our Town Politeneſs, will needs correct the Style of their Prayer-Books. In reading the Abſolution, they are very careful to ſay <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Abſolves;</hi> and in the Prayer for the Royal Family, it muſt be <hi>endue'um, enrich'um, proſper'um,</hi> and <hi>bring'um.</hi> Then in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they uſe all the modern Terms of Art, <hi>Sham, Banter, Mob, Bubble, Bully, Cutting, Shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling,</hi> and <hi>Palming;</hi> all which, and many more of the like Stamp, as I have heard them often in the Pulpit from ſuch young Sophiſters, ſo I have read them in ſome of <hi>thoſe Sermons that have made moſt Noiſe of late.</hi> The Deſign, it ſeems, is to avoid the dreadful Imputation of Pedantry; to ſhew us, that they know the Town, underſtand Men and Manners, and have not been poring upon old unfaſhionable Books in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be glad to ſee you the Inſtrument of introducing into our Style that Simplicity which is the beſt and trueſt Ornament of moſt Things in Life, which the politer Ages always aimed at in their Building and Dreſs, <hi>(Simplex Munditiis)</hi> as well as their Productions of Wit. 'Tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that all new affected Modes of Speech, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borrowed from the Court, the Town, or the Theatre, are the firſt periſhing Parts in any Language; and, as I could prove by many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Inſtances, have been ſo in ours. The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Hooker,</hi> who was a Country Clergyman, and of <hi>Parſons</hi> the Jeſuit, both in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> are in a Style that, with very few Allowances, would not offend any preſent Reader; much more clear and intelligible than thoſe of Sir <hi>H. Wootton,</hi> Sir <hi>Rob. Naunton, Osborn, Daniel</hi> the Hiſtorian, and ſeveral others who writ later; but being Men of the Court, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Phraſes then in Faſhion, they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten either not to be underſtood, or appear perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous.</p>

               <p>THere are very many ill Habits that might with much Eaſe have been prevented, which, after we have indulged our ſelves in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incorrigible. We have a ſort of Proverbial Expreſſion, of <hi>taking a Woman down in her Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Shoes,</hi> if you would bring her to Reaſon. An early Behaviour of this Sort, had a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable good Effect in a Family wherein I was ſeveral Years an intimate Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman in <hi>Lincoluſhire</hi> had Four Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Three of which were early married very happily; but the Fourth, though no Way inferior to any of her Siſters, either in Perſon or Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, had from her Infancy diſcovered ſo imperious a Temper, (uſually called a High Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) that it continually made great Uneaſineſs in the Family, became her known Character in the Neighbourhood, and deterred all her Lovers from declaring themſelves. However, in Proceſs of Time, a Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0397200204:195"/>
long Acquaintance, having obſerved that Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit to be her only Fault, made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and obtained her Conſent in due Form. The Lawyers finiſhed the Writings, (in which, by the Way, there was no Pin-Money) and they were married. After a decent Time ſpent in the Father's Houſe, the Bridegroom went to prepare his Seat for her Reception. During the whole Courſe of his Courtſhip, though a Man of the moſt equal Temper, he had artificially lamented to her, that he was the moſt paſſionate Creature breathing. By this one Intimation, he at once made her underſtand Warmth of Temper to be what he ought to pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her againſt that Conſtitution in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. She at the ſame Time thought her ſelf high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged by the compoſed Behaviour which he maintained in her Preſence. Thus far he with great Succeſs ſoothed her from being guilty of Violences, and ſtill reſolved to give her ſuch a terrible Apprehenſion of his fiery Spirit, that ſhe ſhould never dream of giving Way to her own. He returned on the Day appointed for carrying her Home; but inſtead of a Coach and Six Horſes, together with the gay Equipage ſuitable to the Occaſion, he appeared without a Servant, mounted on the Skeleton of a Horſe which his Huntſman had the Day before brought in to feaſt his Dogs on the Arrival of their new Miſtreſs, with a Pillion fixed behind, and a Caſe of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols before him, attended only by a Favourite Hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging (but ſomewhat poſitive) Manner deſired his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſeat her ſelf on the Cuſhion; which done, away they crawled. The Road being obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Gate, the Dog was commanded to open it: The poor Cur looked up and wagged his Tail; but the Maſter, to ſhew the Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of his Temper, drew a Piſtol and ſhot him dead. He had no ſooner done it, but he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0397200204:196"/>
fell into a Thouſand Apologies for his unhappy Raſhneſs, and begged as many Pardons for his Exceſſes before one for whom he had ſo profound a Reſpect. Soon after their Steed ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but with ſome Difficulty recovered: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Bridegroom took Occaſion to ſwear, if he frighted his Wife ſo again, he would run him through: And alas! the poor Animal being now almoſt tired, made a ſecond Trip; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on which the careful Husband alights, and with great Ceremony firſt takes off his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then the Accoutrements, draws his Sword, and ſaves the Huntſman the Trouble of killing him: Then ſays to his Wife, Child, prithee take up the Saddle; which ſhe readily did, and tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it Home, where they found all Things in the greateſt Order, ſuitable to their Fortune and the preſent Occaſion. Some Time after the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lady gave an Entertainment to all his Daughters and their Husbands, where, when the Wives were retired, and the Gentleman paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Toaſt about, our laſt married Man took Occaſion to obſerve to the reſt of his Brethren, how much, to his great Satisfaction, he found the World miſtaken as to the Temper of his Lady, for that ſhe was the moſt meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Woman breathing. The Applauſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a loud Laugh: But as a Tryal which of them would appear the moſt Maſter at Home, he propoſed they ſhould all by Turns ſend for their Wives down to them. A Servant was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, and Anſwer was made by one, Tell him I will come by and by; another, That ſhe would come when the Cards were out of her Hand; and ſo on. But no ſooner was her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Deſire whiſpered in the Ear of our laſt married Lady, but the Cards were clapped on the Table, and down ſhe comes with, My Dear, would you ſpeak with me? He receives her in his Arms, and after repeated Careſſes tells her

                     <p>I Should have waited on you very frequently to have diſcourſed you upon ſome Matters of Moment, but that I love to be well informed in the Subject upon which I conſult my Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter into Debate with them. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the utmoſt Care and Pains applied my ſelf to the reading all the Writings and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets which have come out ſince the Trial, and have ſtudied Night and Day in order to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the whole Controverſy: But the Authors are ſo numerous, and the State of Affairs alters ſo very faſt, that I am now a Fortnight behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in my Reading, and know only how Things ſtood Twelve Days ago. I wiſh you would enter into thoſe uſeful Subjects; for, if I may be allowed to ſay ſo, theſe are not Times to jeſt in. As for my own Part, you know very well, that I am of a publick Spirit, and never regarded my own Intereſt, but looked further; and let me tell you, that while ſome People are minding only themſelves and Families, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are thinking only of their own Country, Thing go on ſtrangely in the <hi>North.</hi> I foreſee very great Evils ariſing from the Neglect of Tranſactions at a Diſtance; for which Reaſon I am now writing a Letter to a Friend in the Country, which I deſign as an Anſwer to the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0397200204:199"/>
Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>'s Letter to the Grand Signior concerning his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden.</hi> I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove, that it is not reaſonable to expect that his <hi>Swediſh</hi> Majeſty ſhould leave <hi>Bender</hi> without Forty Thouſand Men; and I have added to this, an Apology for the <hi>Coſſacks.</hi> But the Matter multiplies upon me, and I grow dim with much Writing; therefore deſire, if you have an old green Pair of Spectacles, ſuch as you uſed about your Fiftieth Year, that you ſend them to me; as alſo, that you would pleaſe to deſire Mr. <hi>Morphew</hi> to ſend me in a Buſhel of Coals on the Credit of my Anſwer to his Cza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Majeſty; for I deſign it ſhall be printed for <hi>Morphew,</hi> and the Weather grows ſharp. I ſhall take it kindly if you would order him alſo to ſend me the Papers as they come out. If there are no freſh Pamphlets publiſhed, I compute that I ſhall know before the End of next Month what has been done in Town to this Day. If it were not for an ill Cuſtom lately introduced by a certain Author, of talking <hi>Latin</hi> at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Papers, Matters would be in a much clearer Light than they are: But to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, there are ſolid Writers who are not guilty of this Pedantry. The <hi>Poſt-Man</hi> writes like an Angel: The <hi>Moderator</hi> is fine Reading! It would do you no Harm to read the <hi>Poſt-Boy</hi> with Attention; he is very deep of late. He is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive; but I confeſs a little Satyrical: A ſharp Pen! He cares not what he ſays. The <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner</hi> is admirable, and is become a grave and ſubſtantial Author. But above all, I am at a Loſs how to govern my ſelf in my Judgment of thoſe whoſe whole Writings conſiſt in Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories: And then the Way of anſwering, by propoſing Queſtions as hard to them, is quite as extraordinary. As for my Part, I tremble at theſe Novelties; we expoſe, in my Opinion, our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs too much by it. You may be ſure the

               <p>This unhappy Correſpondent, whoſe fantaſtical Loyalty to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> has reduced him to this low Condition of Reaſon and Fortune, would appear much more monſtrous in his Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did we not ſee Crowds very little above his Circumſtances from the ſame Cauſe, a Paſſion to Politicks.</p>
               <p>It is no unpleaſant Entertainment to conſider the Commerce even of the Sexes interrupted by Difference in State Affairs. A Wench and her Gallant parted laſt Week upon the Words <hi>Unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> and <hi>Paſſive:</hi> And there is ſuch a Jargon of Terms got into the Mouths of the very ſillieſt of the Women, that you cannot come into a Room even among them, but you find them divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory.</hi> What heightens the Humour is, that all the hard Words they know, they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuppoſe to be Terms uſeful in the Diſputes of the Parties. I came in this Day where Two were in very hot Debate, and one of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to me to explain to them what was the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Circumciſion and Predeſtination. You may be ſure I was at a Loſs; but they were too angry at each other to wait for my Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but proceeded to lay open the whole State of Affairs, inſtead of the uſual Topicks of Dreſs, Gallantry and Scandal.</p>
               <p>I have often wondered how it ſhould be poſſible that this Turn to Politicks ſhould ſo univerſally prevail, to the Excluſion of every other Subject out
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0397200204:201"/>
of Converſation; and upon mature Conſideration, find it is for Want of Diſcourſe. Look round you among all the young Fellows you meet, and you ſee thoſe who have leaſt Reliſh for Books, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or Pleaſure, though they have no Manner of Qualities to make them ſucceed in thoſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, ſhall make very paſſable Politicians. Thus the moſt barren Invention ſhall find enough to ſay to make one appear an able Man in the Top-Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſes. It is but adding a certain Vehemence in uttering your ſelf, let the Thing you ſay be never ſo flat, and you ſhall be thought a very ſenſible Man, if you were not too hot. As Love and Honour are the nobleſt Motives of Life; ſo the Pretenders to them, without being animated by them, are the moſt contemptible of all Sorts of Pretenders. The unjuſt Affectation of any Thing that is laudable, is ignominious in Proportion to the Worth of the Thing we affect: Thus, as Love of one's Country is the moſt glorious of all Paſſions, to ſee the moſt ordinary Tools in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion give themſelves Airs that Way, without any one good Quality in their own Life, has ſomething in it Romantick, yet not ſo ridiculous as odious.</p>

               <p>WHEN the Mind has been perplexed with anxious Cares and Paſſions, the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of bringing it to its uſual State of Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is, as much as we poſſibly can, to turn our Thoughts to the Adverſities of Perſons of higher Conſideration in Virtue and Merit than our ſelves. By this Means all the little Incidents of our own Lives, if they are unfortunate, ſeem to be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Juſtice upon our Faults and Indiſcretions. When thoſe whom we know to be excellent and deſerving of a better Fate are wretched, we cannot but reſign our ſelves, whom moſt of us know to merit a much worſe State than that we are placed in. For ſuch and many other Occaſions, there is one admirable Relation which one might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend for certain Periods of one's Life, to touch, comfort, and improve the Heart of Man. <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, ſomewhere, The Pleaſures of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman are next to thoſe of a Philoſopher. In like Manner one may ſay, (for methinks they bear the ſame Proportion one to another) the Pleaſures of Humanity are next to thoſe of Devotion. In both theſe latter Satisfactions, there is a certain Humiliation which exalts the Soul above its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary State. At the ſame Time that it leſſens our Value of our ſelves, it enlarges our Eſtimation of others. The Hiſtory I am going to ſpeak of, is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0397200204:203"/>
that of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Holy Writ, which is related with ſuch Majeſtick Simplicity, that all the Parts of it ſtrike us with ſtrong Touches of Nature and Compaſſion, and he muſt be a Stranger to both who can read it with Attention, and not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the Viciſſitudes of Joy and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. I hope it will not be a Prophanation to tell it ones own Way here, that they who may be unthinking enough to be more frequently Readers of ſuch Papers as this than of Sacred Writ, may be advertiſed, that the greateſt Pleaſures the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can be entertained with are to be found there, and that even the Style of the Scriptures is more than Humane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a beloved Child of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> became invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to his elder Brethren, for no other Reaſon but his ſuperior Beauty and Excellence of Body and Mind, inſomuch that they could not bear his growing Virtue, and let him live. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſpire his Death; but Nature pleaded ſo ſtrongly for him in the Heart of one of them, that by his Perſwaſion they determined rather to bury him in a Pit, than be his immediate Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners with their own Hands. When thus much was obtained for him, their Minds ſtill ſoftened towards him, and they took the Opportunity of ſome Paſſengers to ſell him into <hi>Egypt. Iſrael</hi> was perſuaded by the Artifice of his Sons, that the Youth was torn to Pieces by Wild Beaſts: But <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold to Slavery, and ſtill expoſed to new Misfortunes, from the ſame Cauſe as before, his Beauty and his Virtue. By a falſe Accuſation he was committed to Priſon, but in Proceſs of Time delivered from it, in Conſideration of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge, and made the Governor of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Houſe. In this Elevation of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, his Brothers were ſent into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life in a Famine. As ſoon as they are brought into his Preſence, he beholds, but he beholds with Compaſſion, the Men who had ſold
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0397200204:204"/>
him to Slavery approaching him with Awe and Reverence. While he was looking over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he takes a Reſolution to indulge himſelf in the Pleaſure of ſtirring their and his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, by keeping himſelf concealed, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining into the Circumſtances of their Family. For this End, with an Air of Severity, as a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he accuſes them as Spies, who are come into <hi>Egypt</hi> with Deſigns againſt the State. This led them into the Account which he wanted of them, the Condition of their ancient Father and little Brother, whom they had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. When he had learned that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was living, he demands the bringing him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a Proof of their Veracity.</p>
               <p>But it would be a vain and empty Endeavour to attempt laying this excellent Repreſentation of the Paſſions of Man in the ſame Colours as they appear in the Sacred Writ in any other Manner, or almoſt any other Words, than thoſe made uſe of in the Page it ſelf. I am obliged therefore to turn my deſigned Narration rather into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the ſeveral Parts of that beautiful and paſſionate Scene. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> expects to ſee <hi>Benjamin,</hi> How natural, and how forcible is the Reflection, <hi>This Affliction is come upon us in that we ſaw the Anguiſh of our Brother's Soul</hi> without Pity? How moving muſt it be to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to hear <hi>Reuben</hi> accuſe the reſt, that they would not hear what he pleaded in Behalf of his Innocence and Diſtreſs? He turns from them and weeps, but commands his Paſſion ſo far as to give Orders for binding one of them in the Preſence of the reſt, while he at Leiſure obſerved their different Sentiments and Concern in their Geſture and Countenance. When <hi>Benjamin</hi> is demanded in Bondage for ſtealing the Cup, With what Force, and what Reſignation does <hi>Judah</hi> addreſs his Brother?</p>
               <p>In what Words ſhall I ſpeak to my Lord; with what Confidence can I ſay any Thing? Our Guilt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0397200204:205"/>
is but too apparent, we ſubmit to our Fate. <hi>We are my Lord's Servants, both we and he alſo with whom the Cup is found.</hi> When that is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, How pathetically does he recapitulate the whole Story? And approaching nearer to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> delivers himſelf as follows; which, if we fix our Thoughts upon the Relation between the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the Judge, it is impoſſible to read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tears.</p>

                     <p>Let me intrude ſo far upon you even in the high Condition in which you are, and the miſerable One in which you ſee me and my Brethren, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of the Circumſtances of us unhappy Men that proſtrate our ſelves before you. When we were firſt examined by you, you enquired, (for what Reaſon my Lord enquired we know not;) but you enquired whether we had not a Father or a Brother? We then acquainted you, that we had a Father, an old Man, who had a Child of his old Age, and had buried another Son whom he had by the ſame Woman. You were pleaſed to command us to bring the Child he had remaining down to you: We did ſo, and he has forfeited his Liberty. But my Father ſaid to us, You know that my Wife bare me Two Sons, one of them was torn in Pieces: If Miſchief befal this alſo, it will bring my Grey Hairs with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the Grave. Accept, therefore, Oh my Lord! me for your Bond-man, and let the Lad return with his Brethren, that I may not ſee the Evil that ſhall come on my Father. Here <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Paſſion grew too great for further Diſguiſe, and he reveals himſelf with Exclamations of Tranſport and Tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>After their Recovery from their firſt Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Brethren were ſeized with Fear for the Injuries they had done him; but how generouſly does he keep them in Countenance, and make an
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0397200204:206"/>
Apology for them: <hi>Be not angry with your ſelves for ſelling me hither;</hi> call it not ſo, but think Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſent me before you to preſerve Life.</p>
                     <p>It would be endleſs to go through all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this ſacred Narrative; but any who ſhall read it, at an Hour when he is diſengaged from all other Regard or Intereſts than what ariſe from it, will feel the alternate Paſſion of a Father, a Brother, and a Son, ſo warm in him, that they will incline him to exert himſelf (in ſuch of thoſe Characters as happen to be his) much above the ordinary Courſe of his Life.</p>

with their Precepts, and find where it was that we came ſhort or went wide.</p>
                     <p>But after all, I found our Caſe required ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than theſe Doctors had directed, and the principal Defect of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſcipline to lie in the <hi>Initiatory</hi> Part, which, altho' it needs the greateſt Care and Skill, is uſually left to the Conduct of thoſe blind Guides, <hi>viz.</hi> Chance and Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall trouble you with but a ſingle Inſtance, purſuant to what your ſagacious Friend has ſaid, That he <hi>could furniſh you with a Catalogue of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Books, that would coſt you a Hundred Pounds at firſt Hand, wherein you could not find Ten Lines together of common</hi> Grammar; which is a neceſſary Conſequence of our Miſmanagement in that Province.</p>
                     <p>For can any Thing be more abſurd than our Way of Proceeding in this Part of Literature? To puſh tender Wits into the intricate Mazes of Grammar, and a <hi>Latin</hi> Grammer? To learn an unknown Art by an unknown Tongue? To carry them a dark Round-about Way to let them in at a Back-Door? Whereas by teaching them firſt the Grammar of their Mother-Tongue, (ſo eaſy to be learned) their Advance to the Grammars of <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> would be gradual and eaſy; but our precipitate Way of hurrying them over ſuch a <hi>Gulph,</hi> before we have built them a <hi>Bridge</hi> to it, is a Shock to their weak Underſtandings, which they ſeldom, or very late, recover. In the mean Time we wrong Nature, and ſlander Infants, who want neither Capacity nor Will to learn, till we put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Service beyond their Strength, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we baulk them.</p>
                     <p>The Liberal Arts and Sciences are all beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the <hi>Graces;</hi> nor has <hi>Grammar</hi> (the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Mother of all) ſo frightful a Face of her <hi>Own;</hi> 'tis the <hi>Vizard</hi> put upon it that ſcares

Children. She is made to ſpeak hard Words, that to them ſound like Conjuring. Let her talk intelligibly, and they will liſten to her.</p>
                     <p>In this, I think, as on other Accounts, we ſhew our ſelves true <hi>Britains,</hi> always overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our natural Advantages. It has been the Practice of wiſeſt Nations to learn their own Language by ſtated Rules, to avoid the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that would follow from leaving it to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Uſe. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue (ſays a learned Man) is the moſt determinate in its Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and reducible to the feweſt Rules What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Language has leſs Grammar in it, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; and whatever has more, all that it has more is ſuperfluous; for which Reaſons he would have it made the Foundation of learning <hi>Latin,</hi> and all other Languages.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak and write without Abſurdity the Language of one's Country, is commendable in Perſons of all Stations, and to ſome indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary; and to this Purpoſe, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend above all Things the having a <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> of our Mother-Tongue firſt taught in our Schools, which would facilitate our Youths learning their <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek Grammars,</hi> with ſpare Time for Arithmetick, Aſtronomy, Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography, Hiſtory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that would make them paſs the Spring of their Life with Profit and Pleaſure, that is now miſerably ſpent in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Perplexities.</p>
                     <p>But here, methinks, I ſee the Reader ſmile, and ready to ask me, (as the Lawyer did Sexton <hi>Diego</hi> on his bequeathing rich Legacies to the Poor of the Pariſh. Where are theſe mighty Sums to be raiſed?) Where is there ſuch a <hi>Grammar</hi> to be had? I will not anſwer, as he did, Even where your Worſhip pleaſes. No, it is our good Fortune to have ſuch a <hi>Grammar,</hi> with Notes, now in the Preſs, and to be publiſhed next Term.</p>

                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0397200204:210"/>
I hear it is a chargeable Work, and wiſh the Publiſher to have Cuſtomers of all that have Need of ſuch a Book; yet fancy that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much a Sufferer, if it is only bought by all that have more Need for it than they think they have.</p>
                     <p>A certain Author brought a Poem to Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> for his Peruſal and Judgment of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which he demanded at the next Viſit with a Poetaſter's Aſſurance; and Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> with his uſual Modeſty, deſired that he would be pleaſed to look a little to the <hi>Grammar</hi> of it. To the <hi>Grammar</hi> of it! What do you mean, Sir? Would you ſend me to School again? Why Mr. <hi>H—,</hi> Would it do you any Harm?</p>
                     <p>This put me on conſidering how this Voyage of Literature may be made with more Safety and Profit, Expedition and Delight; and at laſt, for compleating ſo good a Service, to requeſt your Directions in ſo deplorable a Caſe; hoping that, as you have had Compaſſion on our over-grown Coxcombs in Concerns of leſs Conſequence, you will exert your Charity towards Innocents, and vouchſafe to be Guardian to the Children and Youth of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in this important Affair of <hi>Education,</hi> wherein Miſtakes and wrong Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures have ſo often occaſioned their Averſion to Books, that had otherwiſe proved the chief Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Pleaſure of their Life.

               <p>AMong thoſe Inclinations which are common to all Men, there is none more unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than that unequal Love by which Parents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh their Children from each other. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Vanity and Self-love appear to have a Share towards this Effect; and in other Inſtances I have been apt to attribute it to meer Inſtinct: But however that is, we frequently ſee the Child that has been beholden to neither of theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes in their Parents, in ſpight of being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, ſnubbed, and thwarted at Home, acquire a Behaviour which makes it as agreeable to all the reſt of the World, as that of every one elſe of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0397200204:212"/>
their Family is to each other. I fell into this Way of Thinking from an Intimacy which I have with a very good Houſe in our Neighbourhood, where there are Three Daughters of a very different Character and Genius. The eldeſt has a great deal of Wit and Cunning; the Second has good Senſe, but no Artifice; the Third has much Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, but little Underſtanding. The Firſt is a fine, but ſcornful Woman; the Second is not charming, but very winning; the Third no Way commendable, but very deſirable. The Father of theſe young Creatures was ever a great Pretender to Wit, the Mother a Woman of as much Coquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This Turn in the Parents has biaſſed their Affections towards their Children. The old Man ſuppoſes the eldeſt of his own Genius, and the Mother looks upon the youngeſt as her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. By this Means, all the Lovers that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Houſe are diſcarded by the Father for not obſerving Mrs. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Wit and Beauty, and by the Mother for being blind to the Mien and Air of Mrs. <hi>Biddy.</hi> Come never ſo many Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they are not ſuſpected to have the leaſt Thoughts of Mrs. <hi>Betty,</hi> the middle Daughter. <hi>Betty</hi> therefore is mortified into a Woman of a great deal of Merit, and knows ſhe muſt depend on that only for her Advancement. The middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is thus the Favourite of all her Acquaintance as well as mine, while the other Two carry a certain Inſolence about them in all Converſations, and expect the Partiality which they meet with at Home to attend them wherever they appear. So little do Parents underſtand that they are of all People the leaſt Judges of their Children's Merit, that what they reckon ſuch is ſeldom any Thing elſe but a Repetition of their own Faults and Infirmities.</p>
               <p>There is, methinks, ſome Excuſe for being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, when one of the Offspring has any Defect in Nature. In this Caſe, the Child, if we may ſo
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0397200204:213"/>
ſpeak, is ſo much the longer the Child of its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and calls for the Continuance of their Care and Indulgence from the Slowneſs of its Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the Weakneſs of its Body. But there is no enduring to ſee Men enamoured only at the Sight of their own Impertinencies repeated, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as we may ſometimes, that they have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Diſlike of their Children for a Degeneracy from their very Crimes. Commend me to Lady <hi>Goodly;</hi> ſhe is equal to all her own Children, but prefers them to thoſe of all the World beſide. My Lady is a perfect Hen in the Care of her Brood; ſhe fights and ſquabbles with all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear where they come, but is wholly unbiaſſed in diſpenſing her Favours among them. It is no ſmall Pains ſhe is at to defame all the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in her Neighbourhood by Viſits, Whiſpers, Intimations, and Hearſays; all which ſhe ends with thanking Heaven, that no one living is ſo bleſſed with ſuch obedient and well inclined Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as her ſelf. Perhaps, ſays ſhe, <hi>Betty</hi> cannot dance like Mrs. <hi>Frontinett,</hi> and it is no great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether ſhe does or not; but ſhe comes into a Room with a good Grace; though ſhe ſays it that ſhould not, ſhe looks like a Gentlewoman. Then if Mrs. <hi>Rebecca</hi> is not ſo talkative as the mighty Wit Mrs. <hi>Clapper,</hi> yet ſhe is diſcreet, ſhe knows better what ſhe ſays when ſhe does ſpeak. If her Wit be ſlow, her Tongue never runs before it. This kind Parent lifts up her Eyes and Hands in Congratulation of her own good Fortune, and is maliciouſly thankful that none of her Girls are like any of her Neighbours: But this Preference of her own to all others, is grounded upon an Impulſe of Nature; while thoſe who like one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another of their own, are ſo unpardonably unjuſt, that it could hardly be equalled in the Children, though they preferred all the reſt of the World to ſuch Parents. It is no unpleaſant Entertainment to ſee a Ball at a Dancing-School,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0397200204:214"/>
and obſerve the Joy of Relations when the young Ones, for whom they are concerned, are in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You need not be told whom the Dancers belong to. At their firſt Appearance the Paſſion of their Parents are in their Faces, and there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Nod of Approbation ſtolen at a good Step, or a graceful Turn.</p>
               <p>I remember among all my Acquaintance but one Man whom I have thought to live with his Children with Equanimity and a good Grace. He had Three Sons and One Daughter, whom he bred with all the Care imaginable in a liberal and ingenuous Way. I have often heard him ſay, He had the Weakneſs to love one much better than the other, but that he took as much Pains to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that as any other Criminal Paſſion that could ariſe in his Mind. His Method was, to make it the only Pretenſion in his Children to his Favour to be kind to each other; and he would tell them, That he who was the beſt Brother, he would reckon the beſt Son. This turned their Thoughts into an Emulation for the Superiority in kind and tender Affection towards each other. The Boys behaved themſelves very early with a Manly Friendſhip; and their Siſter, inſtead of the groſs Familiarities and impertinent Freedoms in Behaviour, uſual in other Houſes, was always treated by them with as much Complaiſance as any other young Lady of their Acquaintance. It was an unſpeakable Pleaſure to viſit or ſit at Meal in that Family. I have often ſeen the old Man's Heart flow at his Eyes with Joy upon Occaſions which would appear indifferent to ſuch as were Strangers to the Turn of his Mind; but a very ſlight Accident, wherein he ſaw his Children's Good-Will to one another, created in him the God-like Pleaſure of loving them, becauſe they loved each other. This great Command of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in hiding his firſt Impulſe to Partiality, at laſt improved to a ſteady Juſtice towards them;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0397200204:215"/>
and that which at firſt was but an Expedient to correct his Weakneſs, was afterwards the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Virtue.</p>
               <p>The Truth of it is, thoſe Parents who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Care of one Child more than that of another, no longer deſerve the Name of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but are in Effect as childiſh as their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in having ſuch unreaſonable and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inclinations. A Father of this Sort has degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf into one of his own Offspring; for none but a Child would take Part in the Paſſions of Children.</p>

                     <p>FInding by ſeveral Paſſages of your <hi>Tatlers,</hi> that you are a Perſon curious in Natural Knowledge, I thought it would not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to you to give you the following Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Migration of Frogs into this Country. There is an ancient Tradition among the wild Philoſophers of the Kingdom, That this whole Iſland was once as much infeſted by Frogs, as that wherein <hi>Whittington</hi> made his Fortune was by Mice. Inſomuch that it is ſaid, <hi>Mackdonald</hi> the Firſt could no more ſleep by reaſon of theſe <hi>Dutch</hi> Nightingales, (as they are called at <hi>Paris</hi>) than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could when they croaked in his Bed-Chamber. It was in the Reign of this great Monarch that St. <hi>Patrick</hi> arrived in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being as famous for deſtroying Vermin as any Rat-catcher of our Times. If we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Tradition, he killed more in one Day than a Flock of Storks could have done in a Twelvemonth. From that Time for about Five hundred Years, there was not a Frog to be heard in <hi>Ireland,</hi> notwithſtanding the Bogs ſtill remained, which in former Ages had been ſo plentifully ſtocked with thoſe Inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>When the Arts began to flouriſh in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and that great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had placed himſelf at the Head of the Royal Society, to lead them forward into the Diſcoveries of Nature, it is ſaid, That ſeveral Propoſals were laid before his Majeſty for the importing of Frogs into <hi>Ireland.</hi> In order to it, a Virtuoſo of known Abilities was unanimouſly elected by the Society, and intruſted with the whole Management of that Affair. For this End he took along with him a ſound Able-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Frog, of a ſtrong hale Conſtitution, that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0397200204:217"/>
had given Proofs of his Vigour by ſeveral Leaps which he made before that Learned Body. They took Ship, and ſailed together till they came within Sight of the Hill of <hi>Hoath,</hi> before the Frog diſcovered any Symptoms of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed by his Voyage: But as the Wind chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped about, and began to blow from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſt, he grew Sea-ſick, or rather Land-ſick; for his learned Companion aſcribed it to the Particles of the Soil with which the Wind was impregnated. He was confirmed in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, when, upon the Wind's turning about, his Fellow Traveller ſenſibly recovered, and continued in good Health till his Arrival upon the Shore, where he ſuddenly relapſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired upon a <hi>Ring</hi>'s-<hi>End</hi> Car in his Way to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> The ſame Experiment was repeated ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Times in that Reign, but to no Purpoſe. A Frog was never known to take Three Leaps upon <hi>Iriſh</hi> Turf, before he ſtretched himſelf out and died.</p>

a very ingenious Phyſician, and a very good Proteſtant; for which Reaſon, to ſhow his Zeal againſt Popery, he placed ſome of the moſt promiſing Spawn in the very Fountain that is dedicated to the Saint, and known by the Name of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Well,</hi> where theſe Animals had the Impudence to make their firſt Appearance.

               <p>There is no Study more becoming a rational Creature, than that of Natural Philoſophy; but as ſeveral of our modern Virtuoſo's manage it, their Speculations do not ſo much tend to open and enlarge the Mind, as to contract and fix it upon Trifles.</p>

               <p>COming Home laſt Night before my uſual Hour, I took a Book into my Hand, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to divert my ſelf with it till Bed-time. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> chanced to be my Author, whoſe admirable Poem of <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> ſerves, at once, to fill the Mind with pleaſing Idea's, and with good Thoughts, and was therefore the moſt proper Book for my Purpoſe. I was amuſing my ſelf with that beautiful Paſſage in which the Poet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents <hi>Eve</hi> ſleeping by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Side, with the Devil ſitting at her Ear, and inſpiring evil Thoughts under the Shape of a Toad. <hi>Ithuriel,</hi> one of the Guardian Angels of the Place, walking his Nightly Rounds, ſaw the great Enemy of Mankind hid in this loathſome Animal, which he touched with his Spear. This Spear being of a Celeſtial Temper, had ſuch a ſecret Virtue in it, that whatever it was applied to, immediately flung off all Diſguiſe, and appeared in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Figure. I am afraid the Reader will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I content my ſelf with explaining the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0397200204:220"/>
Paſſage in Proſe, without giving it in the Author's own inimitable Words:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— On he led his radiant Files,</l>
                  <l>Dazzling the Morn: Theſe to the Bower direct,</l>
                  <l>In Search of whom they ſought. Him there they found,</l>

                  <l>Touch'd lightly; for no Falſhood can endure</l>
                  <l>Touch of Celeſtial Temper, but returns</l>
                  <l>Of Force to his own Likeneſs. Up he ſtarts,</l>
                  <l>Diſcover'd and ſurpriz'd. As when a Spark</l>

                  <l>So ſtarted up in his own Shape the Fiend.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I could not forbear thinking how happy a Man would be in the Poſſeſſion of this Spear; or what an Advantage it would be to a Miniſter of State, were he Maſter of ſuch a White Staff. It would let him diſcover his Friends from his Enemies, Men of Abilities from Pretenders: It would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from being impoſed upon by Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Profeſſions, and might be made uſe of as a Kind of State Teſt, which no Artifice could elude.</p>
               <p>Theſe Thoughts made very lively Impreſſions on my Imagination, which were improv'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being defaced by Sleep, and produced in me the following Dream: I was no ſooner fallen
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0397200204:221"/>
aſleep, but, methoughts, the Angel <hi>Ithuriel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, and with a Smile that ſtill added to his Celeſtial Beauty, made me a Preſent of the Spear which he held in his Hand, and diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To make Trial of it, I went into a Place of publick Reſort.</p>
               <p>The firſt Perſon that paſſed by me, was a Lady that had a particular Shyneſs in the Caſt of her Eye, and a more than ordinary Reſervedneſs in all the Parts of her Behaviour. She ſeemed to look upon Man as an obſcene Creature, with a certain Scorn and Fear of him. In the Height of her Airs I touched her gently with my Wand, when, to my unſpeakable Surprize, ſhe fell upon her Back, and kick'd up her Heels in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as made me bluſh in my Sleep. As I was haſting away from this undiſguiſed Prude, I ſaw a Lady in earneſt Diſcourſe with another, and overheard her ſay with ſome Vehemence, Never tell me of him, for I am reſolv'd to die a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin! I had a Curioſity to try her; but as ſoon as I laid my Wand upon her Head, ſhe immediately fell in Labour. My Eyes were diverted from her by a Man and his Wife, who walked near me Hand in Hand after a very loving Manner. I gave each of them a gentle Tap, and the next Inſtant ſaw the Woman in Breeches, and the Man with a Fan in his Hand. It would be tedious to deſcribe the long Series of Metamorphoſes that I entertained my ſelf with in my Night's Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of Whigs diſguiſed in Tories, and Tories in Whigs; Men in Red Coats that denounced Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in their Countenances, trembling at the Touch of my Spear; others in Black with Peace in their Mouths, but Swords in their Hands. I could tell Stories of Noblemen changed into Uſurers, and Magiſtrates into Beadles; of Free-Thinkers into Penitents, and Reformers into Whoremaſters. I muſt not however omit the Mention of a grave Citizen that paſſed by me with an huge Claſped
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0397200204:222"/>
Bible under his Arm, and a Band of a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Breadth; but upon a Touch on the Shoulder, he let drop his Book, and fell a picking my Pocket.</p>
               <p>In the general I obſerved, that thoſe who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared good, often diſappointed my Expectation; but that on the contrary, thoſe who appeared ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad, ſtill grew worſe upon the Experiment; as the Toad in <hi>Milton,</hi> which one would have thought the moſt deformed Part of the Creation, at <hi>Ithuriel</hi>'s Stroke, became more deformed, and ſtarted up into a Devil.</p>
               <p>Among all the Perſons that I touched, there was but one who ſtood the Teſt of my Wand; and after many Repetitions of the Stroke, ſtuck to his Form, and remained ſteady and fixed in his firſt Appearance. This was a young Man who boaſted of foul Diſtempers, wild Debauches, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults upon holy Men, and Affronts to Religion.</p>
               <p>My Heart was extremely troubled at this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The Contemplation of the whole Species, ſo entirely ſunk in Corruption, filled my Mind with a Melancholy that is inexpreſſible, and my Diſcoveries ſtill added to my Affliction.</p>
               <p>In the Midſt of theſe Sorrows which I had in my Heart, methoughts there paſſed by me a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Coaches with Purple Liveries. There ſate in each of them a Perſon with a very venerable Aſpect. At the Appearance of them, the People who were gathered round me in great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes divided into Parties, as they were diſpoſed to favour either of thoſe reverend Perſons: The Enemies of one of them begged me to touch him with my Wand, and aſſured me, I ſhould ſee his Lawn converted into a Cloak. The oppoſite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty told me with as much Aſſurance, That if I laid my Wand upon the other, I ſhould ſee his Garments embroidered with Flower-de-Luces, and his Head covered with a Cardinal's Cap. I made the Experiment, and to my great Joy, ſaw
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0397200204:223"/>
them both, without any Change, diſtributing their Bleſſings to the People, and praying for thoſe who had reviled them. Is it poſſible, thought I, that good Men, who are ſo few in Number, ſhould be divided among themſelves, and give better Quarter to the Vicious that are in their Party, than the moſt ſtrictly Virtuous who are out of it? Are the Ties of Faction above thoſe of Religion?—I was going on in my Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, but ſome ſudden Accident awakened me, when I found my Hand graſped, but my Spear gone. The Reflection on ſo very odd a Dream made me figure to my ſelf, What a ſtrange Face the World would bear, ſhould all Mankind appear in their proper Shapes and Characters, without Hypocriſy and Diſguiſe? I am afraid, the Earth we live upon would appear to other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Beings no better than a Planet peopled with Monſters. This ſhould, methinks, inſpire us with an honeſt Ambition of recommending our ſelves to thoſe inviſible Spies, and of being what we would appear. There was one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in my foregoing Dream which I at firſt intended to conceal; but upon ſecond Thoughts, I cannot look upon my ſelf as a candid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Hiſtorian, if I do not acquaint my Reader, that upon taking <hi>Ithuriel</hi>'s Spear into my Hand, though I was before an old decrepid Fellow, I appeared a very handſome, jolly, black Man. But I know my Enemies will ſay, this is praiſing my own Beauty, for which Reaſon I will ſpeak no more of it.</p>

               <p>STorms at Sea are ſo frequently deſcribed by the ancient Poets, and copied by the Moderns, that whenever I find the Winds begin to riſe in a new Heroick Poem, I generally skip a Leaf or Two till I come into Fair Weather. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Tempeſt</hi> is a Maſter-piece in this Kind, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo naturally drawn, that one who has made a Voyage can ſcarce read it without being Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
               <p>Land Showers are no leſs frequent among the Poets than the former, but I remember none of them which have not fallen in the Country; for which Reaſon they are generally filled with the Lowings of Oxen, and the Bleatings of Sheep, and very often embelliſhed with a Rainbow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Land Shower</hi> is likewiſe the beſt in its Kind: It is indeed a Shower of Conſequence, and contributes to the main Deſign of the Poem, by cutting off a tedious Ceremonial, and bringing Matters to a ſpeedy Concluſion between Two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of different Sexes. My ingenious Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mr. <hi>Humphry Wagſtaff,</hi> who treats of every Subject after a Manner that no other Author has done, and better than any other can do, has ſent me the Deſcription of a City Shower.

               <p>IT is ridiculous for any Man to criticiſe on the Works of another, who has not diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his own Performances. A Judge would make but an indifferent Figure who had never been known at the Bar. <hi>Cicero</hi> was reputed the greateſt Orator of his Age and Country before he wrote a Book <hi>De Oratore;</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Poet before he publiſhed his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi> This Obſervation ariſes naturally in any one who caſts his Eye upon this laſt mentioned Author, where he will find the Criticiſms placed in the latter End of his Book, that is, after the fineſt Odes and Satyrs in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <p>A Modern, whoſe Name I ſhall not mention, becauſe I would not make a ſilly Paper ſell, was born a Critick and an Examiner, and, like one of the Race of the Serpent's Teeth, came into the World with a Sword in his Hand. His Works put me in mind of the Story that is told of a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monk, who was taking a Catalogue of a Friend's Library, and meeting with a <hi>Hebrew</hi> Book in it, entered it under the Title of, <hi>A Book that has the Beginning where the End ſhould be.</hi> This Author, in the laſt of his Crudities, has amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together a Heap of Quotations, to prove that <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> were both of them modeſter Men than my ſelf, and if his Works were to live as long as mine, they might poſſibly give Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity a Notion, that <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff</hi> was a very
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0397200204:228"/>
conceited old Fellow, and as vain a Man as either <hi>Tully</hi> or Sir <hi>Francis Bacon.</hi> Had this ſerious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fallen upon me only, I could have overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; but to ſee <hi>Cicero</hi> abuſed, is, I muſt confeſs, what I cannot bear. The Cenſure he paſſes upon this great Man runs thus; <hi>The Itch of being very Abuſive, is almoſt inſeparable from Vain-Glory.</hi> Tully <hi>has theſe Two Faults in ſo high a Degree, that nothing but his being the beſt Writer in the World can make Amends for them.</hi> The ſcurrilous Wretch goes on to ſay I am as bad as <hi>Tully.</hi> His Words are theſe; <hi>And yet the</hi> Tatler, <hi>in his Paper of</hi> Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 26, <hi>has out-done him in both. He ſpeaks of himſelf with more Arrogance, and with more Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of others.</hi> I am afraid by his Diſcourſe, this Gentleman has no more read <hi>Plutarch</hi> than he has <hi>Tully.</hi> If he had, he would have obſerved a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in that Hiſtorian, wherein he has with great Delicacy diſtinguiſh'd between Two Paſſions which are uſually complicated in Humane Nature, and which an ordinary Writer would not have thought of ſeparating. Not having my <hi>Greek</hi> Spectacles by me, I ſhall quote the Paſſage Word for Word as I find it tranſlated to my Hand. <hi>Nevertheleſs, tho' he was intemperately fond of his own Praiſe, yet he was very free from envying others, and moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally profuſe in commending both the Ancients and his Contemporaries, as is to be underſtood by his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and many of thoſe Sayings are ſtill recorded, as that concerning</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>That he was a River of flowing Gold: Of</hi> Plato<hi>'s Dialogue, That if</hi> Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>were to ſpeak, he would diſcourſe as he did.</hi> Theophraſtus <hi>he was wont to call his peculiar De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and being asked, Which of</hi> Demoſthenes <hi>his Orations he liked beſt? He anſwered, The longeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as for the Eminent Men of his own Time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Eloquence or Philoſophy, there was not one of them which he did not, by writing or ſpeaking fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of, render more illuſtrious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0397200204:229"/>
Thus the Critick tells us, That <hi>Cicero</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively vain-glorious and abuſive; <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that he was vain, but not abuſive. Let the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve which of them he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>After this he complains to the World, that I call him Names; and that in my Paſſion I ſaid, He was <hi>a Flea, a Louſe, an Owl, a Bat, a ſmall Wit, a Scribbler, and a Nibbler.</hi> When he has thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken his Reader's Pity, he falls into that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vein of Mirth, which I ſhall ſet down at length, it being an exquiſite Piece of Raillery, and written in great Gaiety of Heart. <hi>After this Liſt of Names,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Flea, Louſe, Owl, Bat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>I was ſurpriſed to hear him ſay, that he has hitherto kept his Temper pretty well; I wonder how he will write when he has loſt his Temper? I ſuppoſe, as he now is very angry and unmannerly, he will then be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding courteous and good-humoured.</hi> If I can out-live this Raillery, I ſhall be able to bear any Thing.</p>
               <p>There is a Method of Criticiſm made Uſe of by this Author, (for I ſhall take Care how I call him a Scribbler again) which may turn into Ridicule any Work that was ever written, wherein there is a Variety of Thoughts: This the Reader will obſerve in the following Words; <hi>He</hi> (meaning me) <hi>is ſo intent upon being ſomething extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he ſcarce knows what he would be; and is as fruitful in his Similes, as a Brother of his whom I lately took Notice of. In the Compaſs of a few Lines he compares himſelf to a Fox, to</hi> Daniel Burgeſs, <hi>to the Knight of the Red Croſs, to an Oak with Ivy about it, and to a great Man with an Equipage.</hi> I think my ſelf as much honoured by being joined in this Part of his Paper with the Gentleman whom he here calls my Brother, as I am in the Beginning of it, by being mentioned with <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very hard that a Man cannot publiſh Ten Papers without ſtealing from himſelf; but to ſhow you that this is only a Knack of Writing, and that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0397200204:230"/>
the Author is got into a certain Road of Criticiſm, I ſhall ſet down his Remarks on the Works of the Gentleman whom he here glances upon, as they ſtand in his 6th Paper, and deſire the Reader to compare them with the foregoing Paſſage upon mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Thirty Lines his Patron is a River, the</hi> Primum Mobile, <hi>a Pilot, a Victim, the Sun, any Thing, and Nothing. He beſtows Increaſe, conceals his Source, makes the Machine move, teaches to ſteer, expiates our Offences, raiſes Vapours, and looks larger as he ſets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Poem can be ſafe from this Sort of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm? I think I was never in my Life ſo much offended as at a Wag whom I once met with in a Coffee-houſe: He had in his Hand one of the Miſcellanies, and was reading the following ſhort Copy of Verſes, which, without Flattery to the Author, is (I think) as beautiful in its Kind as any one in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Flavia</hi> the leaſt and flight eſt Toy</l>
                  <l>Can with reſiſtleſs Art employ.</l>
                  <l>This Fan in meaner Hands would prove</l>
                  <l>An Engine of ſmall Force in Love;</l>
                  <l>But ſhe with ſuch an Air and Mien,</l>
                  <l>Not to be told, or ſafely ſeen,</l>
                  <l>Directs its wanton Motions ſo,</l>
                  <l>That it wounds more than <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Bow;</l>
                  <l>Gives Coolneſs to the matchleſs Dame,</l>
                  <l>To ev'ry other Breaſt a Flame.</l>
               </q>
               <p>When this Coxcomb had done reading them, Heyday! ſays he, What Inſtrument is this that <hi>Flavia</hi> employs in ſuch a Manner as is not to be told, nor ſafely ſeen? In Ten Lines it is a Toy, a <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Bow, a Fan, and an Engine in Love. It has wanton Motions, it wounds, it cools, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames.</p>
               <p>Such Criticiſms make a Man of Senſe ſick, and a Fool merry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0397200204:231"/>
The next Paragraph of the Paper we are talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, falls upon ſome Body whom I am at a Loſs to gueſs at: But I find the whole Invective turns upon a Man who (it ſeems) has been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for Debt. Whoever he was, I muſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pity him; but at the ſame Time muſt put the Examiner in Mind, that notwithſtanding he is a Critick, he ſtill ought to remember he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Poverty was never thought a proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for Ridicule; and I do not remember that I ever met with a Satyr upon a Beggar.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe little Retortings of my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, of <hi>being dull by Deſign, witty in</hi> October, <hi>ſhining, excelling,</hi> and ſo forth; they are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cavils of every Witlin, who has no other Method of ſhowing his Parts, but by little Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Repetitions of the Man's Words whom he attacks.</p>
               <p>But the Truth of it is, the Paper before me, not only in this Particular, but in its very Eſſence, is like <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Eccho:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Quae nec reticere loquenti,</l>

               </q>
               <p>I ſhould not have deſerved the Character of a Cenſor, had I not animadverted upon the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Author by a gentle Chaſtiſement: But I know my Reader will not pardon me, unleſs I declare, that nothing of this Nature for the future (unleſs it be written with ſome Wit) ſhall divert me from my Care of the Publick.</p>

               <p>I DO not remember that in any of my Lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations I have touched upon that uſeful Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Phyſick, notwithſtanding I have declared my ſelf more than once a Profeſſor of it. I have indeed joined the Study of Aſtrology with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I never knew a Phyſician recommend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Publick who had not a Siſter Art to embelliſh his Knowledge in Medicine. It has been commonly obſerved in Compliment to the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious of our Profeſſion, that <hi>Apollo</hi> was God of Verſe as well as Phyſick; and in all Ages the moſt celebrated Practitioners of our Country were the particular Favourites of the Muſes. Poetry to Phyſick is indeed like the Gilding to a Pill; it makes the Art ſhine, and covers the Severity of the Doctor with the Agreeableneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
               <p>The very Foundation of Poety is good Senſe, if we may allow <hi>Harace</hi> to be a Judge of the Art. <q>

And if ſo, we have Reaſon to believe, that the ſame Man who writes well can preſcribe well, if he has applied himſelf to the Study of both. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when we ſee a Man making Profeſſion of Two different Sciences, it is natural for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is no Pretender in that which we are not Judges of when we find him skilful in that which we underſtand.</p>

Ordinary Quacks and Charlatans are throughly ſenſible how neceſſary it is to ſupport themſelves by theſe collateral Aſſiſtances, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lay their Claim to ſome ſupernumerary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments which are wholly foreign to their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>About 20 Years ago, it was impoſſible to walk the Streets without having an Advertiſement thruſt into your Hand of a Doctor <hi>who was arrived at the Knowledge of the Green and Red Dragon, and had diſcovered the Female Fern Seed.</hi> No Body ever knew what this meant; but the Green and Red Dragon ſo amuſed the People, that the Doctor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very comfortably upon them. About the ſame Time there was paſted a very hard Word upon every Corner of the Streets. This, to the beſt of my Remembrance, was
<q>TETRACHYMAGOGON.</q>
Which drew great Shoals of Spectators about it, who read the Bill that it introduced with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Curioſity; and when they were ſick, would have no Body but this learned Man for their Phyſician.</p>
               <p>I once received an Advertiſement of one <hi>who had ſtudied Thirty Years by Candle-light for the Good of his Countrymen.</hi> He might have ſtudied Twice as long by Day-light, and never have been taken Notice of: But Lucubrations cannot be over-valued. There are ſome who have gained themſelves great Reputation for Phyſick by their Birth, as the <hi>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son;</hi> and others by not being born at all, as the <hi>Unborn Doctor,</hi> who, I hear, is lately gone the Way of his Patients, having died worth Five Hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> though he was not <hi>born</hi> to a Halfpenny.</p>
               <p>My ingenious Friend Doctor <hi>Saffold,</hi> ſucceeded my old Contemporary Doctor <hi>Lilly</hi> in the Studies both of Phyſick and Aſtrology, to which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0397200204:234"/>
that of Poetry, as was to be ſeen both upon the Sign where he lived, and in the Bills which he diſtributed. He was ſucceeded by Doctor <hi>Caſe,</hi> who eraſed the Verſes of his Predeceſſor out of the Sign-Poſt, and ſubſtituted in their Stead Two of his own, which were as follow:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Within this Place</l>
                  <l>Lives Doctor <hi>Caſe.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>He is ſaid to have got more by this Diſtich, than Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> did by all his Works. There would be no End of enumerating the ſeveral imaginary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and unaccountable Artifices by which this Tribe of Men enſnare the Minds of the Vulgar, and gain Crowds of Admirers. I have ſeen the whole Front of a Mountebank's Stage from one End to the other faced with Patents, Certificates, Medals, and Great Seals, by which the ſeveral Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> have teſtified their particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Eſteem for the Doctor. Every great Man with a ſounding Title has been his Patient. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I have ſeen Twenty Mountebanks that have given Phyſick to the Czar of <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> The Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> eſcapes no better. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> was likewiſe a very good Patient.</p>
               <p>This great Condeſcenſion of the Doctor draws upon him much Good-Will from his Audience; and it is Ten to One, but if any of them be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with an aching Tooth, his Ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a Perſon who has had ſo many Princes, Kings, and Emperors, under his Hands.</p>
               <p>I muſt not leave this Subject without obſerving, that as Phyſicians are apt to deal in Poetry, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries endeavour to recommend themſelves by Oratory, and are therefore without Controverſy the moſt eloquent Perſons in the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I would not willingly diſcourage any of the Arts, eſpecially that of which I am an humble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor; but I muſt confeſs, for the Good of my
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0397200204:235"/>
native Country, I could wiſh there might be a Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Phyſick for ſome Years, that our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which has been ſo much exhauſted by the Wars, might have Leave to recruit it ſelf.</p>
               <p>As for my ſelf, the only Phyſick which has brought me ſafe to almoſt the Age of Man, and which I preſcribe to all my Friends, is Abſtinence. This is certainly the beſt Phyſick for Prevention, and very often the moſt effectual againſt a preſent Diſtemper. In ſhort, my <hi>Recipe</hi> is, <hi>Take nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were the Body Politick to be phyſick'd like particular Perſons, I ſhould venture to preſcribe to it after the ſame Manner. I remember when our wholeIſland was ſhaken with an Earthquake ſome Years ago, there was an impudent Mountebank who ſold Pills which (as he told the Country People) were very good againſt an Earthquake. It may perhaps be thought as abſurd to preſcribe a Diet for the allaying Popular Commotions, and National Ferments. But I am verily perſwaded, that if in ſuch a Caſe a whole People were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Courſe of Abſtinence, and eat nothing but Water-gruel for a Fortnight, it would abate the Rage and Animoſity of Parties, and not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle contribute to the Cure of a diſtracted Nation. Such a Faſt would have a natural Tendency to the procuring of thoſe Ends for which a Faſt is uſually proclaimed. If any Man has a Mind to enter on ſuch a voluntary Abſtinence, it might not be improper to give him the Caution of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> in particular:</p>
               <q>Abſtine a Fabis.</q>
               <q>' Abſtain from Beans.</q>
               <p>That is, ſay the Interpreters, Meddle not with Elections, Beans having been made Uſe of by the Voters among the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the Choice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>

               <p>A Method of ſpending one's Time agreeably is a Thing ſo little ſtudied, that the common Amuſement of our young Gentlemen (eſpecially of ſuch as are at a Diſtance from thoſe of the firſt Breeding) is Drinking. This Way of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has Cuſtom of its Side; but as much as it has prevailed, I believe there have been very few Companies that have been guilty of Exceſs this Way, where there have not happened more Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which make againſt, than for the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. It is very common that Events ariſe from a Debauch which are fatal, and always ſuch as are diſagreeable. With all a Man's Reaſon and good Senſe about him, his Tongue is apt to utter Things out of meer Gaiety of Heart which may diſpleaſe his beſt Friends. Who then would truſt himſelf to the Power of Wine, without ſaying more againſt it, than that it raiſes the Imagination, and depreſſes the Judgment. Were there only this ſingle Conſideration, That we are leſs Maſters of our ſelves when we drink in the leaſt Proportion above the Exigencies of Thirſt; I ſay, were this all that could be objected, it were ſufficient to make us abhor this Vice. But we may go on to ſay, that as he who drinks but a little is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of himſelf, ſo he who drinks much is a Slave to himſelf. As for my Part, I ever eſteemed a Drunkard of all vicious Perſons the moſt vicious: For if our Actions are to be weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the Intention of them, what can we think of him who puts himſelf into a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0397200204:237"/>
wherein he can have no Intention at all, but incapacitates himſelf for the Duties and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Life, by a Suſpenſion of all his Faculties. If a Man conſidered, that he cannot under the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Drink be a Friend, a Gentleman, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or a Subject; that he has ſo long baniſhed himſelf from all that is dear, and given up all that is ſacred to him, he would even then think of a Debauch with Horror: But when he looks ſtill further, and acknowledges, that he is not only expelled out of all the Relations of Life, but alſo liable to offend againſt them all, What Words can expreſs the Terror and Deteſtation he would have of ſuch a Condition? And yet he owns all this of himſelf who ſays he was drunk laſt Night.</p>
               <p>As I have all along perſiſted in it, that all the Vicious in general are in a State of Death, ſo I think I may add to the Non-Exiſtence of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, that they died by their own Hands. He is certainly as guilty of Suicide who periſhes by a ſlow, as he that is diſpatched by an immediate, Poiſon. In my laſt Lucubration I propoſed the general Uſe of Water-gruel, and hinted, that it might not be amiſs at this very Seaſon: But as there are ſome, whoſe Caſes, in regard to their Families, will not admit of Delay, I have uſed my Intereſt in ſeveral Wards of the City, that the wholeſome Reſtorative above-mentioned may be given in Tavern Kitchens to all the Mornings Draught Men within the Walls when they call for Wine before Noon. For a further Reſtraint and Mark upon ſuch Perſons, I have given Orders, that in all the Offices where Policies are drawn upon Lives, it ſhall be added to the Article which prohibits that the Nominee ſhould croſs the Sea, the Words, <hi>Provided alſo, That the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> A. B. <hi>ſhall not drink before Dinner during the Term mentioned in this Indenture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not without Hopes but by this Method I ſhall bring ſome unſizeable Friends of mine into
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0397200204:238"/>
Shape and Breath, as well as others who are languid and conſumptive into Health and Vigour. Moſt of the Self-Murderers whom I yet hinted at, are ſuch as preſerve a certain Regularity in taking their Poiſon, and make it mix pretty well with their Food: But the moſt conſpicuous of thoſe who deſtroy themſelves, are ſuch as in their Youth fall into this Sort of Debauchery, and contract a certain Uneaſineſs of Spirit, which is not to be diverted but by Tippling as often as they can fall into Company in the Day, and conclude with downright Drunkenneſs at Night. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen never know the Satisfaction of Youth, but skip the Years of Manhood, and are decrepid ſoon after they are of Age. I was Godfather to one of theſe old Fellows. He is now Three and Thirty, which is the Grand Climacterick of a young Drunkard. I went to viſit the crazy Wretch this Morning, with no other Purpoſe but to rally him under the Pain and Uneaſineſs of being ſober.</p>
               <p>But as out Faults are double when they affect others beſides our ſelves, ſo this Vice is ſtill more odious in a married than a ſingle Man. He that is the Husband of a Woman of Honour, and comes Home overloaded with Wine, is ſtill more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in Proportion to the Regard we have to the unhappy Conſort of his Beſtiality. The Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination cannot ſhape to its ſelf any Thing more monſtrous and unnatural than the Familiarities between Drunkenneſs and Chaſtity. The wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> who is the Perfection of Beauty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, has long been thus condemned for Life. The Romantick Tales of Virgins devoted to the Jaws of the Monſters, have nothing in them ſo terrible as the Gift of <hi>Aſtraea</hi> to that Bacchanal.</p>
               <p>The Reflection of ſuch a Match as ſpotleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence with abandoned Lewdneſs, is what puts this Vice in the worſt Figure it can bear with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to others; but when it is looked upon with Reſpect only to the Drunkard himſelf, it has De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0397200204:239"/>
enough to make it diſagreeable, which may be ſummed up in a Word, by allowing, that he who reſigns his Reaſon, is actually guilty of all that he is liable to from the Want of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. S.</hi> Among many other Enormities, there are Two in the following Letters which I think ſhould be ſuddenly amended; but ſince they are Sins of Omiſſion only, I ſhall not make Remarks upon them till I find the Delinquents perſiſt in their Errors; and the inſerting the Letters themſelves ſhall be all their preſent Admonition.</p>

               <p>IT was with very great Diſpleaſure I heard this Day a Man ſay of a Companion of his with an Air of Approbation, <hi>You know</hi> Tom <hi>never fails of ſaying a ſpightful Thing.</hi> He has a great deal of Wit, but Satyr is his particular Talent. <hi>Did you mind how he put the young Fellow out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that pretended to talk to him?</hi> Such imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Applauſes, which one meets with every Day, put me upon conſidering what true Raillery and Satyr were in themſelves; and this, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, occurred to me from Reflection upon the great and excellent Perſons that were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Talents this Way. When I had ran over ſeveral ſuch in my Thoughts, I concluded, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unaccountable the Aſſertion might appear at firſt Sight) that Good-Nature was an eſſential Quality in a Satyriſt, and that all the Sentiments which are beautiful in this Way of Writing muſt proceed from that Quality in the Author. Good-Nature produces a Diſdain of all Baſeneſs, Vice, and Folly, which prompts them to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Smartneſs againſt the Errors of Men, without Bitterneſs towards their Perſons. This Quality keeps the Mind in Equanimity, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lets an Offence unſeaſonably throw a Man out of his Character. When <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaid, He that did not hate <hi>Bavius</hi> might love <hi>Maevius,</hi> he
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0397200204:242"/>
was in perfect good Humour, and was not ſo much moved at their Abſurdities, as paſſionately to call them Sots or Blockheads in a direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective, but laughed at them with a Delicacy of Scorn, without any Mixture of Anger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The beſt good Man, with the worſt-natured Muſe,</hi> was the Character among us of a Gentleman as famous for his Humanity as his Wit.</p>
               <p>The ordinary Subjects for Satyr are ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the greateſt Indignation in the beſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and conſequently Men of ſuch a Make are the beſt qualified for ſpeaking of the Offences in Humane Life. Theſe Men can behold Vice and Folly when they injure Perſons to whom they are wholly unacquainted, with the ſame Severity as others reſent the Ills they do themſelves. A good-natured Man cannot ſee an over-bearing Fellow put a baſhful Man of Merit out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or outſtrip him in the Purſuit of any Advantage; but he is on Fire to ſuccour the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to produce the Merit of the one, and confront the Impudence of the other.</p>
               <p>The Men of the greateſt Character in this Kind were <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Juvenal.</hi> There is not, that I remember, one ill-natured Expreſſion in all their Writings, not one Sentence of Severity which does not apparently proceed from the contrary Diſpoſition. Whoever reads them, will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, be of this Mind; and if they were read with this View, it may poſſibly perſwade our young Fellows, that they may be very witty Men without ſpeaking ill of any but thoſe who deſerve it: But in the Peruſal of theſe Writers it may not be unneceſſary to conſider, that they lived in very different Times. <hi>Horace</hi> was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with a Prince of the greateſt Goodneſs and Humanity imaginable, and his Court was formed after his Example: Therefore the Faults that Poet falls upon were little Inconſiſtencies in Behaviour, falſe Pretences to Politeneſs, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0397200204:243"/>
Affectations of what Men were not fit for. Vices of a coarſer Sort could not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Conſideration, or enter the Palace of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus. Juvenal</hi> on the other Hand lived under <hi>Domitian,</hi> in whoſe Reign every Thing that was great and noble was baniſhed the Habitations of the Men in Power. Therefore he attacks Vice as it paſſes by in Triumph, not as it breaks into Converſation. The Fall of Empire, Contempt of Glory, and a general Degeneracy of Manners, are before his Eyes in all his Writings. In the Days of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> to have talked like <hi>Juvenal</hi> had been Madneſs, or in thoſe of <hi>Domitian</hi> like <hi>Horace.</hi> Morality and Virtue are every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in <hi>Horace,</hi> as became a Man in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Court, from the Beauty, the Propriety, the Convenience, of purſuing them. Vice and Corruption are attacked by <hi>Juvenal</hi> in a Style which denotes, he fears he ſhall not be heard without he calls to them in their own Language, with a bare-faced Mention of the Villanies and Obſcenities of his Contemporaries.</p>
               <p>This accidental Talk of theſe Two great Men runs me from my Deſign, which was to tell ſome Coxcombs that run about this Town with the Name of Smart Satyrical Fellows, that they are by no Means qualified for the Characters they pretend to, of being ſevere upon other Men, for they want Good-Nature. There is no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them for arriving at what they aim at; and they may as well pretend to flatter, as rail agreeably without being Good-Natured.</p>
               <p>There is a certain Impartiality neceſſary to make what a Man ſays bear any Weight with thoſe he ſpeaks to. This Quality, with Reſpect to Men's Errors and Vices, is never ſeen but in Good-natured Men. They have ever ſuch a Frankneſs of Mind, and Benevolence to all Men, that they cannot receive Impreſſions of Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without mature Deliberation; and writing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0397200204:244"/>
or ſpeaking ill of a Man upon Perſonal Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratious, is ſo irreparable and mean an Injury, that no o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

But the Truth of it is, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſts deſcribe the Age, and Backbiters aſſign their Deſcriptions to private Men.</p>
               <p>In all Terms of Reproof, when the Sentence appears to ariſe from Perſonal Hatred or Paſſion, it is not then made the Cauſe of Mankind, but a Miſunderſtanding between Two Perſons. For this Reaſon, the Repreſentations of a Good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Man bear a Pleaſantry in them, which ſhows there is no Malignity at heart, and by Conſequence are attended to by his Hearers or Readers becauſe they are unprejudiced. This Deference is only what is due to him; for no Man thoroughly nettled can ſay a Thing general enough to paſs off with the Air of an Opinion declared, and not a Paſſion gratified. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a humorous Fellow at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when he heard any one had ſpoken ill of him, uſed to ſay, <hi>I won't take my Revenge on him till I have forgiven him.</hi> What he meant by this, was, that he would not enter upon this Subject till it was grown as indifferent to him as any other; and I have, by this Rule, ſeen him more than once triumph over his Adverſary with an inimitable Spirit and Humour; for he came to the Aſſault againſt a Man full of ſore Places, and he himſelf invulnerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0397200204:245"/>
There is no Poſſibility of ſucceeding in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical Way of Writing or Speaking, except a Man throws himſelf quite out of the Queſtion. It is great Vanity to think any one will attend a Thing becauſe it is your Quarrel. You muſt make your Satyr the Concern of Society in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, if you would have it regarded. When it is ſo, the Good-Nature of a Man of Wit will prompt him to many brisk and diſdainful Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Replies, to which all the Malice in the World will not be able to repartee.</p>

               <p>I Have ſomewhere made Mention of <hi>Gyges</hi>'s Ring, and intimated to my Reader, that it was at preſent in my Poſſeſſion, though I have not ſince made any Uſe of it. The Tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Ring is very Romantick, and taken Notice of both by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> who each of them make an admirable Uſe of it for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Morality. This <hi>Gyges</hi> was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Shepherd to King <hi>Candaules.</hi> As he was wandering over the Plains of <hi>Lydia,</hi> he ſaw a great Chaſm in the Earth, and had the Curioſity to enter it. After having deſcended pretty far into it, he found the Statue of an Horſe in Braſs, with Doors in the Sides of it. Upon opening of them, he found the Body of a dead Man big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than ordinary, with a Ring upon his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0397200204:246"/>
which he took off, and put it upon his own. The Virtues of it were much greater than he at firſt imagined; for upon his going into the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Shepherds, he obſerved, that he was inviſible when he turned the Stone of the Ring within the Palm of his Hand, and viſible when he turned it towards his Company. Had <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicers</hi> been as well verſed in the Occult Sciences as I am, they would have found a great deal of Myſtick Learning in this Tradition; but it is impoſſible for an Adept to be underſtood by one who is not an Adept.</p>
               <p>As for my ſelf, I have with much Study and Application arrived at this great Secret of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my ſelf inviſible, and by that Means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying my ſelf where I pleaſed; or to ſpeak in Roſycrucian Lore, I have entered into the Clefts of the Earth, diſcovered the Brazen Horſe, and robbed the dead Giant of his Ring. The Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſays further of <hi>Gyges,</hi> that by the Means of this Ring he gained Admiſſion into the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Parts of the Court, and made ſuch Uſe of thoſe Opportunities, that he at length became King of <hi>Lydia.</hi> For my own Part, I, who have always rather endeavoured to improve my Mind than my Fortune, have turned this Ring to no other Advantage than to get a thorough Inſight into the Ways of Men, and to make ſuch Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the Errors of others as may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Publick, whatever Effect they may have upon my ſelf.</p>
               <p>About a Week ago, not being able to ſleep, I got up and put on my magical Ring, and with a Thought tranſported my ſelf into a Chamber where I ſaw a Light. I found it inhabited by a celebrated Beauty, though ſhe is of that Species of Women whith we call a Slattern. Her Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and one of her Shoes lay upon a Chair, her Petticoat in one Corner of the Room, and her Girdle that had a Copy of Verſes made upon
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0397200204:247"/>
it but the Day before, with her Thread Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the middle of the Floor. I was ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly officious, that I could not forbear gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her Cloaths together to lay them upon the Chair that ſtood by her Bed-ſide, when, to my great Surpriſe, after a little Muttering, ſhe cried out, <hi>What do you do? Let my Petticoat alone.</hi> I was ſtartled at firſt, but ſoon found that ſhe was in a Dream; being one of thoſe who, to uſe <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Expreſſion, are <hi>ſo looſe of Thought,</hi> that they utter in their Sleep every Thing that paſſes in their Imagination. I left the Apartment of this Female Rake, and went into her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, where there lay a Male-Coquet. He had a Bottle of Salts hanging over his Head, and upon the Table, by his Bed-ſide, <hi>Suckling</hi>'s Poems, with a little Heap of Black Patches on it. His Snuff Box was within Reach on a Chair: But while I was admiring the Diſpoſition which he made of the ſeveral Parts of his Dreſs, his Slumber ſeemed interrupted by a Pang, that was accompanied by a ſudden Oath, as he turned himſelf over haſtily in his Bed. I did not care for ſeeing him in his nocturnal Pains, and left the Room.</p>
               <p>I was no ſooner got into another Bed-Chamber, but I heard very harſh Words uttered in a ſmooth uniform Tone. I was amazed to hear ſo great a Volubility in Reproach, and thought it too cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to be ſpoken by one aſleep; but upon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer, I ſaw the Head dreſs of the Perſon who ſpoke, which ſhewed her to be a Female with a Man lying by her Side broad awake, and as quiet as a Lamb. I could not but admire his exemplary Patience, and diſcovered by his whole Behaviour, that he was then lying under the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of a Curtain-Lecture.</p>
               <p>I was entertained in many other Places with this Kind of Nocturnal Eloquence, but obſerved, that moſt of thoſe whom I found awake, were
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0397200204:248"/>
kept ſo either by Envy or by Love. Some of theſe were ſighing, and others curſing, in Soliloquy; ſome hugged their Pillows, and others gnaſhed their Teeth.</p>
               <p>The Covetous I likewiſe found to be a very wakeful People. I happened to come into a Room where one of them lay ſick. His Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and his Wife were in cloſe Whiſper near his Bed-ſide. I overheard the Doctor ſay to the poor Gentlewoman, he cannot poſſibly live till Five in the Morning. She received it like the Miſtreſs of a Family prepared for all Events. At the ſame Inſtant came in a Servant Maid, who ſaid, <hi>Madam, The Undertaker is below according to your Order.</hi> The Words were ſcarce out of her Mouth, when the ſick Man cried out with a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Voice, Pray, Doctor, how went Bank-Stock to Day at <hi>'Change?</hi> This melancholy Object made me too ſerious for diverting my ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Way: But as I was going Home, I ſaw a Light in a Garret, and entering into it, heard a Voice crying, <hi>And, Hand, Stand, Band, Fann'd, Tann'd.</hi> I concluded him by this and the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Room to be a Lunatick; but upon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening a little longer, perceived it was a Poet, writing an Heroick upon the enſuing Peace.</p>
               <p>It was now towards Morning, an Hour when Spirits, Witches, and Conjurers are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their own Apartments, and feeling the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of it, I was haſtening Home, when I ſaw a Man had got half Way into a Neighbour's Houſe. I immediately called to him, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Ring, appeared in my proper Perſon. There is ſomething Magiſterial in the Aſpect of the <hi>Bickerſtaffs,</hi> which made him run away in Confuſion.</p>
               <p>As I took a Turn or Two in my own Lodging, I was thinking, that, old as I was, I need not go to Bed alone, but that it was in my Power to marry the fineſt Lady in this Kingdom, if I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0397200204:249"/>
would wed her with this Ring. For what a Figure would ſhe that ſhould have it make a Viſit, with ſo perfect a Knowledge as this would give her of all the Scandal in the Town? But inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to diſpoſe of my ſelf and it in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I reſolved to lend it to my loving Friend the Author of the <hi>Atalantis,</hi> to furniſh a new <hi>Secret Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Secret Memoirs.</hi>

               <p>IT is no eaſy Matter when People are advancing in any Thing, to prevent their going too faſt for want of Patience. This happens in nothing more frequently than in the Proſecution of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Hence it is, that we meet Crowds who attempt to be eloquent before they can ſpeak. They affect the Flowers of Rhetorick before they underſtand the Parts of Speech. In the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Converſation of this Town, there are ſo many who can, as they call it, talk well, that there is not One in Twenty that talks to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. This proceeds from an Ambition to excel, or, as the Term is, to ſhine, in Company. The Matter is not to make themſelves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but admired. They come together with a certain Emulation, rather than Benevolence. When you fall among ſuch Companions, the ſafe Way is to give your ſelf up, and let the Orators declaim for your Eſteem, and trouble your ſelf
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0397200204:250"/>
no further. It is ſaid, that a Poet muſt be born ſo; but I think it may be much better ſaid of an Orator, eſpecially when we talk of our Town-Poets and Orators; but the Town-Poets are full of Rules and Laws, the Town-Orators go thro' thick and thin, and are, forſooth. Perſons of ſuch eminent natural Parts and Knowledge of the World, that they deſpiſe all Men as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Scholaſticks who wait for an Occaſion before they ſpeak, or who ſpeak no more than is neceſſary. They had half perſwaded me to go to the Tavern the other Night, but that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whiſpered me, Prithee, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> go with us; there is <hi>Tom Varniſh</hi> will be there, and he is a Fellow that talks as well as any Man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, when a Man expreſſes himſelf well upon any Occaſion, and his falling into an Account of any Subject ariſes from a Deſire to oblige the Company, or from Fulneſs of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance it ſelf, ſo that his ſpeaking of it at large is occaſioned only by the Openneſs of a Companion; I ſay, in ſuch a Caſe as this, it is not only pardonable, but agreeable when a Man takes the Diſcourſe to himſelf; but when you ſee a Fellow watch for Opportunities for being Copious, it is exceſſively troubleſome. A Man that ſtammers, if he has Underſtanding, is to be attended with Patience and good Nature; but he that ſpeaks more than he need, has no Right to ſuch an Indulgence. The Man who has a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his Speech takes Pains to come to you, while a Man of a weak Capacity with Fluency of Speech triumphs in out-running you. The Stammerer ſtrives to be fit for your Company; the loquacious Man endeavours to ſhow you, you are not fit for his.</p>
               <p>With Thoughts of this Kind do I always enter into that Man's Company who is recommended as a Perſon that talks well; but if I were to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0397200204:251"/>
chuſe the People with whom I would ſpend my Hours of Converſation, they ſhould be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as laboured no farther than to make themſelves readily and clearly apprehended, and would have Patience and Curioſity to underſtand me. To have good Senſe, and Ability to expreſs it, are the moſt eſſential and neceſſary Qualities in Companions. When Thoughts riſe in us fit to utter, among familiar Friends there needs but very little Care in cloathing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urbanus</hi> is, I take it, a Man one might live with whole Years, and enjoy all the Freedom and Improvement imaginable, and yet be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of a Contradiction to you in all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes you can be guilty of. His great good Will to his Friends has produced in him ſuch a general Deference in his Diſcourſe, that if he differs from you in his Senſe of any Thing, he introduces his own Thoughts by ſome agreeable Circumlocution, or he has often obſerved ſuch and ſuch a Circumſtance that made him of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion. Again, where another would be apt to ſay, This I am confident of, I may pretend to judge of this Matter as well as any Body; <hi>Urbanus</hi> ſays, I am verily perſwaded, I believe one may conclude. In a Word, there is no Man more clear in his Thoughts and Expreſſions than he is, or ſpeaks with greater Diffidence. You ſhall hardly find one Man of any Conſideration, but you ſhall obſerve one of leſs Conſequence form himſelf after him. This happens to <hi>Urba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> but the Man who ſteals from him almoſt every Sentiment he utters in a whole Week, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes the Theft, by carrying it with quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Air. <hi>Umbratilis</hi> knows <hi>Urbanus</hi>'s doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Way of Speaking proceeds from Good-Nature and Good-Breeding, and not from Uncertainty in his Opinions. <hi>Umbratilis</hi> therefore has no more to do but repeat the Thoughts of <hi>Urbanus</hi> in a poſitive Manner, and appear to the Undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0397200204:252"/>
a wiſer Man than the Perſon from whom he borrows: But thoſe who know him, can ſee the Servant in his Maſter's Habit; and the more he ſtruts, the leſs do his Clothes appear his own.</p>
               <p>In Converſation, the Medium is neither to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Silence or Eloquence; not to value our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and to endeavour to excel us who are of your Company, are equal Inquiries. The great Enemies therefore to good Company, and thoſe who tranſgreſs moſt againſt the Laws of Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which is the Life of it) are, the Clown, the Wit, and the Pedant. A Clown, when he has Senſe, is conſcious of his Want of Education, and with an aukward Bluntneſs hopes to keep himſelf in Countenance, by overthrowing the Uſe of all polite Behaviour. He takes Advantage of the Reſtraint good Breeding lays upon others not to offend him to treſpaſs againſt them, and is under the Man's own Shelter while he intrudes upon him. The Fellows of this Claſs are very frequent in the Repetition of the Words, Rough and Manly. When theſe People happen to be by their Fortunes of the Rank of Gentlemen, they defend their other Abſurdities by an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Courage; and to help out the Defect of their Behaviour, add their being dangerous to their being diſagreeable. This Gentleman (though he diſpleaſes, profeſſes to do ſo, and knowing that, dares ſtill go on to do ſo) is not ſo painful a Companion as he who will pleaſe you againſt your Will, and reſolves to be a Wit.</p>
               <p>This Man upon all Occaſions, and whoever he falls in Company with, talks in the ſame Circle, and in the ſame Round of Chat which he has learned at one of the Tables of this Coffee-houſe. As Poetry is in it ſelf an Elevation above ordinary and common Sentiments, ſo there is no Fop is ſo very near a Mad-man in indifferent Company as a Poetical one. He is not apprehenſive that the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0397200204:253"/>
Generality of the World are intent upon the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their own Fortune and Profeſſion, and have as little Capacity as Curioſity to enter into Matters of Ornament or Speculation. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at a full Table in the City, one of theſe ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitary Wits was entertaining the Company with a Soliloquy (for ſo I call it when a Man talks to thoſe who do not underſtand him) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Wit and Humour. An honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who ſate next to me, and was worth Half a Plumb, ſtared at him, and obſerving there was ſome Senſe as he thought, mixed with his Impertinence, whiſpered me, <hi>Take my Word for it, this Fellow is more Knave than Fool.</hi> This was all my good Friend's Applauſe of the wittieſt Man of Talk that I was ever preſent at, which wanted nothing to make it excellent but that there was no Occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>The Pedant is ſo obvious to Ridicule, that it would be to be one to offer to explain him. He is a Gentleman ſo well known, that there is none but thoſe of his own Claſs who do not laugh at and avoid him. Pedantry proceeds from much Reading and little Underſtanding. A Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant among Men of Learning and Senſe, is like an ignorant Servant giving an Account of a polite Converſation. You may find he has brought with him more than could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his Head without being there, but ſtill that he is not a Bit wiſer than if he had not been there at all.</p>

               <p>WHen one conſiders the Turn which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation takes in almoſt every Set of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, Club or Aſſembly, in this Town or Kingdom, one cannot but obſerve, that in ſpight of what I am every Day ſaying, and all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Writers ſince the Beginning of the World have ſaid, the Subject of Diſcourſe is generally upon one another's Faults. This in a great Meaſure proceeds from Self-Conceit, which were to be endured in one or other individual Perſon; but the Folly has ſpread it ſelf almoſt over all the Species; and one cannot only ſay, <hi>Tom, Jack,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> but in general, <hi>That Man is a Coxcomb.</hi> From this Source it is, that any Excellence is faintly received, any Imperfection unmercifully expoſed. But if Things were put in a true Light, and we would take Time to conſider that Man in his very Nature is an imperfect Being, our Senſe of this Matter would be immediately altered, and the Word <hi>Imperfection</hi> would not carry an unhinder Idea than the Word <hi>Humanity.</hi> It is a pleaſant Story, that we, forſooth, who are the only imperfect Creatures in the Univerſe, are the only Beings that will not allow of Imperfection. Some Body has taken Notice, that we ſtand in the Middle of Exiſtencies, and are by this one Circumſtance the moſt unhappy of all others. The Brutes are guided by Inſtinct, and know no
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0397200204:259"/>
Sorrow; the Angels have Knowledge, and they are happy; but Men are govern'd by Opinion, which is I know not what Mixture of Inſtinct and Knowledge, and are neither indolent nor happy. It is very obſervable, that Criticks are a People between the Learned and the Ignorant, and by that Situation enjoy the Tranquility of neither. As Criticks ſtand among Men, ſo do Men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral between Brutes and Angels. Thus every Man as he is a Critick and a Coxcomb, till im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Reaſon and Speculation, is ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting himſelf, and laying open the Faults of others.</p>
               <p>At the ſame Time that I am talking of the Cruelty of urging People's Faults with Severity, I cannot but bewail ſome which Men are guilty of for want of Admonition. Theſe are ſuch as they can eaſily mend, and no Body tells them of; for which Reaſon I ſhall make Uſe of the Penny-Poſt, (as I have with Succeſs to ſeveral young Ladies about turning their Eyes, and holding up their Heads) to certain Gentlemen whom I remark ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually guilty of what they may reform in a Moment. There is a fat Fellow whom I have long remarked wearing his Breaſt open in the Midſt of Winter, out of an Affectation of Youth. I have therefore ſent him juſt now the following Letter in my Phyſical Capacity.</p>

               <p>Inſtead of this honeſt private Method, or a Friendly one Face to Face, of acquainting People with Things in their Power to explain or amend, the uſual Way among People is to take no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Things you can help, and nevertheleſs expoſs you for thoſe you cannot.</p>

would in a fews Years know the Forms of Orders ſo well, as to direct and dictate with ſo much Eaſe, as to be thought a ſolid, able, and at the ſame Time, a ſure Man of Diſpatch. <hi>Levis,</hi> with a little Reading and coming more into Company, would ſoon be able to write a Song, or lead up a Country-Dance. Inſtead of theſe proper Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, in Obedience to their reſpective Genius's, <hi>Plumbeus</hi> endeavours to be the Man of Pleaſure, and <hi>Levis</hi> the Man of Buſineſs. This appears in their Speech, and in their Dreſs: <hi>Plumbeus</hi> is ever egregiouſly fine, and talking ſomething like Wit; <hi>Levis</hi> is ever extremely grave, and with a ſilly Face repeating Maxims. Theſe Two pardon each other for affecting what each is incapable of, the one to be wiſe, and the other gay; but are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely critical in their Judgments of each other in their Way towards what they pretend to, <hi>Plumbeus</hi> acknowledges <hi>Levis</hi> a Man of a great Reach, becauſe it is what <hi>Plumbeus</hi> never cared for being thought himſelf, and <hi>Levis</hi> allows <hi>Plumbeus</hi> to be an agreeable Rake for the ſame Reaſon. Now were theſe dear Friends to be free with each other as they ought to be, they would change Characters, and be both as commendable, inſtead of being as ridiculous, as their Capacities will admit of.</p>
               <p>Were it not too grave, all that I would urge on this Subject is, that Men are bewildered when they conſider themſelves in any other View than that of Strangers, who are in a Place where it is no great Matter whether they can, or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expect they ſhould, have every Thing about them as well as at their own Home. This Way of Thinking is, perhaps, the only one that can put this Being into a proper Poſture for the Eaſe of Society. It is certain, this would reduce all Faults into thoſe which proceed from Malice or Diſhoneſty: It would quite change our Manner of beholding one another, and nothing that was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0397200204:262"/>
not below a Man's Nature would be below his Character. The Arts of this Life would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Advances towards the next; and a very good Man would be a very fine Gentleman. As it now is, Humane Life is inverted, and we have not learned half the Knowledge of this World before we are dropping into another. Thus, inſtead of the Raptures and Contemplations which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend a well-ſpent Life from the Approach of Eternity, even we old Fellows are afraid of the Ridicule of thoſe who are born ſince us, and aſhamed not to underſtand, as well as peeviſh to reſign, the Mode, the Faſhion, the Ladies, the Fiddles, the Balls, and what not. <hi>Dick Reptile,</hi> who does not want Humour, is very pleaſant at our Club when he ſees an old Fellow touchy at being laughed at for any Thing that is not in the Mode, and bawls in his Ear, <hi>Prithee don't mind him; tell him thou art mortal.</hi>

                     <p>A very agreeable young Gentleman, who is endowed with all the good Quallities that can make a Man compleat, has this long Time maid Love to me in the moſt paſſionat Manner that was poſable. He has left nothing unſaid to make me belive his Affections real; and in his Letters expreſſed himſelf ſo hanſomly, and ſo tenderly, that I had all the Reaſon imaginable to belive him ſinceir. In ſhort, he poſitively has promiſed me he would marry me: But I find all he ſaid nothing; for when the Queſtion was put to him, he wouldn't; but ſtill would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my Humble Servant, and would go on at the ould Rate, repeating the Aſſurences of his Fidelity (and at the ſame Time has none in him). He now writs to me in the ſame endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Style he uſt to do, would have me ſpake to no Man but himſelf. His Eſtate is in his oune Hand, his Father being dead.

Pray, Sir, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinous, and tell me cordially, if you don't think I ſhall do my ſelf an Injurey if I keep Company or a Coroſpondance any longer with this Gentleman. I hope you'le faver an honeſt <hi>North Briton</hi> (as I am) with your Advice in this Amoure; for I am reſolved juſt to folow your Directions.

                     <p>I Have frequently read over your Letter, and am of Opinion, that as lamentable as it is, it is the moſt common of any Evil that attends our Sex. I am very much troubled for the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs you expreſs towards your Lover, but rejoice at the ſame Time that you can ſo far ſurmount your Inclination for him as to reſolve to diſmiſs him when you have my Brother's Opinion for it. His Senſe of the Matter, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to communicate to you. Oh <hi>Almei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra!</hi> The common Failing of our Sex is to value the Merit of our Lovers rather from the Grace of their Addreſs, than the Sincerity of their Hearts. <hi>He has expreſſed himſelf ſo handſomely!</hi> Can you ſay, that after you have Reaſon to doubt his Truth? It is a very melancholy Thing, that in this Circumſtance of Love (which is the moſt important of all others in Female Life) we Women, who are, they ſay, always weak, are ſtill weakeſt. The true Way of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing a Man, is to conſider his Reputation among the Men: For Want of this neceſſary Rule towards her Conduct, when it is too late, we find our ſelves married to the Outcaſts of that Sex; and it is generally from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable among Men, that Fellows endeavour to make themſelves pleaſing to us. The little Accompliſhments of coming into a Room with a good Air, and telling while they are with us what we cannot hear among our ſelves, uſually make up the whole of a Woman's Man's Merit. But if we, when we began to reflect upon our Lover, in the firſt Place conſidered what Figures they make in the Camp, at the Bar, on the <hi>'Change,</hi> in their Country, or at Court, we ſhould
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0397200204:265"/>
behold them in quite another View than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>Were we to behave our ſelves according to this Rule, we ſhould not have the juſt Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of favouring the ſillieſt of Mortals, to the great Scandal of the wiſeſt, who value our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as it advances their Pleaſure, not their Reputation. In a Word, Madam, if you would judge aright in Love, you muſt look upon it as in a Caſe of Friendſhip. Were this Gentleman treating with you for any Thing but your ſelf, when you had conſented to his Offer, if he fell off, you would call him a Cheat and an Impoſtor. There is therefore nothing left for you to do, but to deſpiſe him and your ſelf for doing with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</p>

               <p>I have heard it often argued in Converſation, that this Evil Practice is owing to the perverted Taſt of the Wits in the laſt Generation. A Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine on the Throne could very eaſily make the Language and the Faſhion turn his own Way. Hence it is, that Woman is treated as a Miſtreſs, and not a Wife. It is from the Writings of thoſe Times, and the traditional Accounts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches of their Men of Pleaſure, that the Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs now-a-days take upon them, forſooth, to be falſe Swains and perjured Lovers. Methinks I feel all the Woman riſe in me, when I reflect upon the nauſeous Rogues that pretend to deceive us. Wretches, that can never have it in their Power to over-reach any Thing living but their Miſtreſſes! In the Name of Goodneſs, if we are deſigned by Nature as ſuitable Companions to the other Sex, Why are we not treated accordingly? If we have Merit, as ſome allow, Why is it not as baſe in Men to injure us as one another? If we are the Inſignificants that others call us, Where is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0397200204:266"/>
the Triumph in deceiving us? But when I look at the Bottom of this Diſaſter, and recollect the many of my Acquaintance whom I have known in the ſame Condition with the <hi>Northern Laſs</hi> that occaſions this Diſcourſe, I muſt own I have ever found the Perfidiouſneſs of Men has been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally owing to ourſelves, and we have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to our own Deceit. The Truth is, we do not conduct our ſelves as we are courted, but as we are inclined. When we let our Imaginations take this unbridled Swing, it is not he that acts beſt is moſt lovely, but he that is moſt lovely acts beſt. When our humble Servants make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, we do not keep our ſelves enough diſinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be Judges of their Merit; and we ſeldom give our Judgment of our Lover, till we have loſt our Judgment of him.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Clarinda</hi> was paſſionately attended and addreſſed to by <hi>Strephon,</hi> who is a Man of Senſe and Knowledge in the World; and <hi>Caſſio,</hi> who has a plentiful Fortune and an excellent Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe fell in Love with <hi>Damon</hi> at a Ball: From that Moment ſhe that was before the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature of all my Acquaintance, cannot hear <hi>Strephon</hi> ſpeak, but it is ſomething ſo out <hi>of the Way of Ladies Converſation:</hi> And <hi>Caſſio</hi> has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince opened his Mouth before us, but ſhe whiſpers me, <hi>How ſeldom do Riches and Senſe go together?</hi> The Iſſue of all this is, that for the Love of <hi>Damon,</hi> who has neither Experience, Underſtanding, or Wealth, ſhe deſpiſes thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in the other Two which ſhe finds want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Lover; or elſe thinks he has them for no Reaſon but becauſe he is her Lover. This and many other Inſtances may be given in this Town; but I hope thus much may ſuffice to prevent the Growth of ſuch Evils at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

               <p>IT may perhaps appear ridiculous; but I muſt confeſs, this laſt Summer as I was riding in <hi>Enfield Chaſe,</hi> I met a young Lady whom I could hardly get out of my Head, and for ought I know my Heart, ever ſince. She was mounted on a Pad, with a very well-fancied Furniture. She ſate her Horſe with a very graceful Air; and when I ſaluted her with my Hat, ſhe bowed to me ſo obligingly, that whether it was her Civility or Beauty that touched me ſo much, I know not, but I am ſure I ſhall never forget her. She dwells in my Imagination in a Figure ſo much to her Advantage, that if I were to draw a Picture of Youth, Health, Beauty, or Modeſty, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent any or all of them in the Perſon of that young Woman.</p>
               <p>I do not find that there are any Deſcriptions in the ancient Poets ſo beautiful as thoſe they draw of Nymphs in their Paſtoral Dreſſes and Exerciſes. <hi>Virgil</hi> gives <hi>Venus</hi> the Habit of a <hi>Spartan</hi> Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs when ſhe is to put <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his Way, and relieve his Cares with the moſt agreeable Object imaginable. <hi>Diana</hi> and her Train are always deſcribed as Inhabitants of the Woods, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Chaſe. To be well diverted, is the ſafeſt Guard to Innocence; and, methinks, it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0397200204:268"/>
ſhould be one of the firſt Things to be regarded among People of Condition to find out proper Amuſements for young Ladies. I cannot but think this of Riding might eaſily be revived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, when they conſider how much it muſt contribute to their Beauty. This would lay up the beſt Portion they could bring into a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a good Stock of Health, to tranſmit to their Poſterity. Such a charming Bloom as this gives the Countenance, is very much preferable to the real or affected Feebleneſs or Softneſs, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Faces of our modern Beauties.</p>
               <p>The Comedy, called, <hi>The Ladies Cure,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Affectation of wan Looks and languid Glances to a very entertaining Extravagance. There is, as the Lady in the Play complains, ſomething ſo robuſt in perfect Health, that it is with her a Point of Breeding and Delicacy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick with a ſickly Air. But the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gaiety and Spirit which ſhine in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of ſuch as form to themſelves a Sort of diverting Induſtry by chuſing Recreations that are Exerciſes, ſurpaſs all the falſe Ornaments and Graces that can be put on by applying the whole Diſpenſary of a Toilet. An healthy Body and a chearful Mind give Charms as irreſiſtible as ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable. The Beauteous <hi>Dictynna,</hi> who came to Town laſt Week, has from the conſtant Proſpect in a delicious Country, and the moderate Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Journeys in the Viſits ſhe made round it, contracted a certain Life in her Countenance which will in vain employ both the Painters and Poets to repreſent. The becoming Negligence in her Dreſs, the ſevere Sweetneſs of her Looks, and a certain innocent Boldneſs in all her Behaviour, are the Effect of the active Recreations I am talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of ſuch or any other as innocent and pleaſing Method of paſſing away their Time with Alacrity, we have many in Town who
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0397200204:269"/>
ſpend their Hours in an indolent State of Body and Mind, without either Recreations or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. I am apt to believe, there are ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents imagine their Daughters will be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough, if nothing interrupts their Growth or their Shape. According to this Method of Education, I could name you Twenty Families, where all the Girls hear of in this Life is, That it is Time to riſe and to come to Dinner; as if they were ſo inſignificant as to be wholly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for when they are fed and cloathed.</p>
               <p>It is with great Indignation that I ſee ſuch Crowds of the Female World loſt to humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and condemned to a Lazineſs, which makes Life paſs away with leſs Reliſh than in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Labour. <hi>Paleſtris</hi> in her Drawing-Room, is ſupported by Spirits to keep off the Returns of Spleen and Melancholy, before ſhe can get over half the Day for want of ſomething to do, while the Wench in the Kitchen ſings and ſcowrs from Morning to Night.</p>
               <p>The next diſagreeable Thing to a lazy Lady, is a very buſy one. A Man of Buſineſs in good Company, who gives an Account of his Abilities and Diſpatches, is hardly more inſupportable than her they call a Notable Woman, and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager. Lady <hi>Goodday,</hi> where I viſited the other Day at a very polite Circle, entertained a great Lady with a <hi>Recipe</hi> for a Poultice, and gave us to underſtand, that ſhe had done extraordinary Cures ſince ſhe was laſt in Town. It ſeems a Countryman had wounded himſelf with his Sithe as he was Mowing; and we were obliged to hear of her Charity, her Medicine, and her Humility, in the harſheſt Tone, and courſeſt Language ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
               <p>What I would requeſt in all this Prattle is, that our Females would either let us have their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or their Minds in ſuch Perfection as Nature deſigned them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0397200204:270"/>
The Way to this is, that thoſe who are in the Quality of Gentlewomen ſhould propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome ſuitable Method of paſſing away their Time. This would furniſh them with Reflections and Sentiments proper for the Companions of reaſonable Men, and prevent the unnatural Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages which happen every Day between the moſt accompliſhed Women, and the verieſt Oafs; the worthieſt Men, and the moſt inſignificant Females. Were the general Turn of Womens Education of another Kind than it is at preſent, we ſhould want one another for more Reaſons than we do as the World now goes. The common Deſign of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is to get their Girls off as well as they can, and make no Conſcience of putting into our Hands a Bargain for our whole Life, which will make our Hearts ake every Day of it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore take this Matter into ſerious Conſideration, and will propoſe, for the better Improvement of the Fair Sex, a <hi>Female Library.</hi> This Collection of Books ſhall conſiſt of ſuch Authors as do not corrupt while they divert, but ſhall tend more immediately to improve them, as they are Women. They ſhall be ſuch as ſhall not hurt a Feature by the Auſterity of their Reflections, nor cauſe one impertinent Glance by the Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. They ſhall all tend to advance the Value of their Innocence as Virgins, improve their Underſtanding as Wives, and regulate their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs as Parents. It has been very often ſaid in theſe Lucubrations, that the Ideas which moſt frequently paſs through our Imaginations, leave Traces of themſelves in our Countenances. There ſhall be a ſtrict Regard had to this in my Female Library, which ſhall be furniſhed with nothing that ſhall give Supplies to Oſtentation or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, but the whole ſhall be ſo digeſted for the Uſe of my Students, that they ſhall not go out of Character in their Enquiries, but their Knowledge appear only a cultivated Innocence.</p>

               <p>I Was laſt Night viſited by a Friend of mine who has an inexhauſtible Fund of Diſcourſe, and never fails to entertain his Company with a Variety of Thoughts and Hints that are altogether new and uncommon. Whether it were in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to my Way of Living, or his real Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he advanced the following Paradox, That it required much greater Talents to fill up and become a retired Life, than a Life of Buſineſs. Upon this Occaſion he rallied very agreeably the buſie Men of the Age, who only valued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of being in Motion, and paſſing through a Series of trifling and inſignificant Actions. In the Heat of his Diſcourſe, ſeeing a Piece of Money lying on my Table, I defie (ſays he) any of theſe active Perſons to produce half the Adventures that this Twelvepenny-Piece has been engaged in, were it poſſible for him to give us an Account of his Life.</p>
               <p>My Friend's Talk made ſo odd an Impreſſion upon my Mind, that ſoon after I was a-Bed I fell inſenſibly into a moſt unaccountable <hi>Reſverie,</hi> that had neither Moral nor Deſign in it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo properly called a Dream as a Delirium.</p>
               <p>Methoughts the Shilling that lay upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reared it ſelf upon its Edge, and turning the Face towards me, opened its Mouth, and in a ſoft
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0397200204:272"/>
Silver Sound gave me the following Account of his Life and Adventures:</p>
               <p>I was born, ſays he, on the Side of a Mountain, near a little Village of <hi>Peru,</hi> and made a Voyage to <hi>England</hi> in an Ingot, under the Convoy of Sir <hi>Francis Drake.</hi> I was, ſoon after my Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, taken out of my <hi>Indian</hi> Habit, refined, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized, and put into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mode, with the Face of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on one Side, and the Arms of the Country on the other. Being thus equipped, I found in me a wonderful Inclination to ramble, and viſit all the Parts of the new World into which I was brought. The People very much favoured my natural Diſpoſition, and ſhifted me ſo faſt from Hand to Hand, that before I was Five Years old, I had travelled into almoſt every Corner of the Nation. But in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Sixth Year, to my unſpeakable Grief, I fell into the Hands of a miſerable old Fellow, who clapped me into an Iron Cheſt, where I found Five Hundred more of my own Quality who lay under the ſame Confinement. The only Relief we had, was to be taken out and counted over in the freſh Air every Morning and Evening. After an Impriſonment of ſeveral Years, we heard ſome Body knocking at our Cheſt, and breaking it open with an Hammer. This we found was the old Man's Heir, who, as his Father lay a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſo good as to come to our Releaſe: He ſeparated us that very Day. What was the Fate of my Companions, I know not: As for my ſelf, I was ſent to the Apothecary's Shop for a Pint of Sack. The Apothecary gave me to an Herb-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Herb-Woman to a Butcher, the Butcher to a Brewer, and the Brewer to his Wife, who made a Preſent of me to a Nonconformiſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. After this Manner I made my Way merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the World; for, as I told you before, we Shillings love nothing ſo much as travelling. I ſometimes fetched in a Shoulder of Mutton
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0397200204:273"/>
ſometimes a Play-Book, and often had the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to treat a Templer at a Twelvepenny Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or carry him with Three Friends to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Midſt of this pleaſant Progreſs which I made from Place to Place, I was arreſted by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious old Woman, who ſhut me up in a greazy Purſe, in Purſuance of a fooliſh Saying, That while ſhe kept a Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Shilling about her, ſhe ſhould never be without Money. I continued here a cloſe Priſoner for many Months, till at laſt I was exchanged for Eight and Forty Farthings.</p>
               <p>I thus rambled from Pocket to Pocket till the Beginning of the Civil Wars, when (to my Shame be it ſpoken) I was employed in raiſing Soldiers againſt the King: For being of a very tempting Breadth, a Serjeant made Uſe of me to inveigle Country Fellows, and liſt them in the Service of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had made one Man ſure, his Way was to oblige him to take a Shilling of a more homely Figure, and then practiſe the ſame Trick upon another. Thus I continued doing great Miſchief to the Crown, till my Officer chancing one Morning to walk Abroad earlier than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſacrificed me to his Pleaſures, and made Uſe of me to ſeduce a Milk-Maid. This Wench bent me, and gave me to her Sweetheart, applying more properly than ſhe intended the uſual Form of, <hi>To my Love and from my Love.</hi> This unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Gallant marrying her within few Days after, pawned me for a Dram of Brandy, and drinking me out next Day, I was beaten flat with an Hammer, and again ſet a running.</p>
               <p>After many Adventures, which it would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to relate, I was ſent to a young Spendthrift, in Company with the Will of his deceaſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The young Fellow, who I found was very extravagant, gave great Demonſtrations of Joy at
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0397200204:274"/>
the Receiving the Will; but opening it, he found himſelf diſinherited and cut off from the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a fair Eſtate, by Vertue of my being made a Preſent to him. This put him into ſuch a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that after having taken me in his Hand, and curſed me, he ſquirred me away from him as far as he could fling me. I chanced to light in an unfrequented Place under a dead Wall, where I lay undiſcovered and uſeleſs, during the Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About a Year after the King's Return, a poor Cavalier that was walking there about Dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fortunately caſt his Eye upon me, and, to the great Joy of us both, carried me to a Cook's-Shop, where he dined upon me, and drank the King's Health. When I came again into the World, I found that I had been happier in my Retirement than I thought, having probably by that Means eſcaped wearing a monſtrous Pair of Breeches.</p>
               <p>Being now of great Credit and Antiquity, I was rather looked upon as a Medal than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Coin; for which Reaſon a Gameſter laid hold of me, and converted me into a Counter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got together ſome Dozens of us for that Uſe. We led a melancholy Life in his Poſſeſſion, being buſy at thoſe Hours wherein Current Coin is at reſt, and partaking the Fate of our Maſter, being in a few Moments valued at a Crown, a Pound, or a Sixpence, according to the Situation in which the Fortune of the Cards placed us. I had at length the good Luck to ſee my Maſter break, by which Means I was again ſent Abroad under my primitive Denomination of a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs over many other Accidents of leſs Moment, and haſten to that fatal Cataſtrophe when I fell into the Hands of an Artiſt who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed me under Ground, and with an unmerciful Pair of Sheers cut off my Titles, clipped my
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0397200204:275"/>
Brims, retrenched my Shape, rubbed me to my inmoſt Ring, and, in ſhort, ſo ſpoiled and pillaged me, that he did not leave me worth a Groat. You may think what a Confuſion I was in to ſee my ſelf thus curtailed and disfigured. I ſhould have been aſhamed to have ſhown my Head, had not all my old Acquaintance been reduced to the ſame ſhameful Figure, excepting ſome few that were punched through the Belly. In the midſt of this general Calamity, when every Body thought our Misfortune irretrievable, and our Caſe deſperate, we were thrown into the Furnace together, and (as it often happens with Cities ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of a Fire) appeared with greater Beauty and Luſtre than we could ever boaſt of before. What has happened to me ſince this Change of Sex which you now ſee, I ſhall take ſome other Opportunity to relate. In the mean Time I ſhall only repeat Two Adventures, as being very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and neither of them having ever happened to me above once in my Life. The Firſt was, my being in a Poet's Pocket, who was ſo taken with the Brightneſs and Novelty of my Appearance, that it gave Occaſion to the fineſt Burleſque Poem in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Language, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, <hi>The Splendid Shilling.</hi> The Second Adventure, which I muſt not omit, happened to me in the Year 1703, when I was given away in Charity to a blind Man; but indeed this was by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Laſt Winter erected a Court of Juſtice for the correcting of ſeveral Enormities in Dreſs and Behaviour, which are not cognizable in any other Courts of this Realm. The Vintner's Caſe which I there tryed is ſtill freſh in every Man's Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That of the Petticoat gave alſo a general Satisfaction, not to mention the more important Points of the Cane and Perſpective; in which, if I did not give Judgments and Decrees according to the ſtricteſt Rules of Equity and Juſtice, I can ſafely ſay, I acted according to the beſt of my Underſtanding.

               <p>As I laſt Year preſided over a Court of Juſtice, it is my intention this Year to ſet my ſelf at the Head of a Court of Honour. There is no Court o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I am likewiſe informed, that there is not one of that honourable Board at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent who has not been driven out of the Field by the Duke of <hi>Marlborough:</hi> But whether this be only an accidental or a neceſſary Qualification, I muſt confeſs I am not able to determine.</p>

As for the Court of Honour of which I am here ſpeaking, I intend to ſit my ſelf in it as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, with ſeveral Men of Honour on my Right Hand, and Women of Virtue on my Left, as my Aſſiſtants. The Firſt Place of the Bench I have given to an old <hi>Tangereen</hi> Captain with a Wooden Leg. The Second is a Gentleman of a long twiſted Periwig without a Curl in it, a Muff with very little Hair upon it, and a Thread-bare Coat with new Buttons, being a Perſon of great Worth, and Second Brother to a Man of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Third is a Gentleman-Uſher, extreamly well read in Romances, and Grandſon to one of the greateſt Wits in <hi>Germany,</hi> who was ſome Time Maſter of the Ceremonies to the Duke of <hi>Wolfembuttel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for thoſe who ſit further on my Right Hand, as it is uſual in publick Courts, they are ſuch as will fill up the Number of Faces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bench, and ſerve rather for Ornament than Uſe.</p>
               <p>The chief upon my Left Hand are, an old Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Lady, that preſerves ſome of the beſt Blood of <hi>England</hi> in her Veins.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Welſh</hi> Woman of a little Stature, but high Spirit.</p>
               <p>An old Prude that has cenſured every Marriage for theſe Thirty Years, and is lately wedded to a young Rake.</p>
               <p>Having thus furniſhed my Bench, I ſhall eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Correſpondencies with the Horſe-Guards, and the Veterans of <hi>Chelſea College;</hi> the former to furniſh me with Twelve Men of Honour as often as I ſhall have Occaſion for a Grand Jury, and the latter with as many good Men and true for a Petty Jury.</p>
               <p>As for the Women of Virtue, it will not be difficult for me to find them about Midnight at Crimp and Baſſet.</p>

                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0397200204:278"/>
Having given this publick Notice of my Court, I muſt further add, that I intend to open it on this Day Sevennight, being <hi>Monday</hi> the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Inſtant; and do hereby invite all ſuch as have ſuffered Injuries and Aſtronts, that are not to be redreſſed by the common Laws of this Land, whether they be ſhort Bows, cold Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſupercilious Looks, unreturned Smiles, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Behaviour, or forced Familiarity; as alſo all ſuch as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous Expreſſion, accidental Juſtle, or unkind Repartee; likewiſe all ſuch as have been defrauded of their Right to the Wall, tricked out of the upper End of the Table, or have been ſuffered to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own Wrong on the Back-Seat of the Coach: Theſe, and all of theſe, I do, as I above ſaid, invite to bring in their ſeveral Caſes and Complaints, in which they ſhall be relieved with all imaginable Expedition.</p>
               <p>I am very ſenſible, that the Office I have now taken upon me will engage me in the Diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many weighty Points that daily perplex the Youth of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and therefore I have already diſcuſſed ſeveral of them for my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Uſe; as, How far a Man may brandiſh his Cane in the telling a Story, without inſulting his Hearer? What Degree of Contradiction amounts to the Lye? How a Man ſhould reſent another's ſtaring and cocking a Hat in his Face? If asking Pardon is an Attonement for treading upon ones Toes? Whether a Man may put up a Box on the Ear received from a Stranger in the Dark? Or, Whether a Man of Honour may take a Blow of his Wife? With ſeveral other Subtilties of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>For my Direction in the Duties of my Office, I have furniſhed my ſelf with a certain Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pair of Scales which I have contrived for this Purpoſe. In one of them I lay the Injuries, in the other the Reparations. The firſt are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0397200204:279"/>
by little Weights made of a Metal reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Iron, and the other in Gold. Theſe are not only lighter than the Weights made uſe of in Averdupois, but alſo than ſuch as are uſed in Troy-Weight. The heavieſt of thoſe that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Injuries amount but to a Scruple; and decreaſe by ſo many Sub-diviſions, that there are ſeveral imperceptible Weights which cannot be ſeen without the Help of a very fine Microſcope.

               <p>IT is neceſſary to an eaſy and happy Life, to poſſeſs our Minds in ſuch a Manner as to be always well ſatisfied with our own Reflections.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0397200204:280"/>
The Way to this State, is to meaſure our Actions by our own Opinion, and not by that of the reſt of the World. The Senſe of other Men ought to prevail over us in Things of leſs Conſideration, but not in Concerns where Truth and Honour are engaged. When we look into the Bottom of Things, what at firſt appears a Paradox, is a plain Truth; and thoſe Profeſſions which, for Want of being duly weighed, ſeem to proceed from a Sort of Romantick Philoſophy, and Ignorance of the World, after a little Reflection are ſo reaſonable, that it is direct Madneſs to walk by any other Rules. Thus to contradict our Deſires, and to conquer the Impulſes of our Ambition, if they do not fall in with what we in our inward Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments approve, is ſo much our Intereſt, and ſo abſolutely neceſſary to our real Happineſs, that to contemn all the Wealth and Power in the World, where they ſtand in Competition with a Man's Honour, is rather good Senſe than Greatneſs of Mind.</p>
               <p>Did we conſider that the Mind of a Man is the Man himſelf, we ſhould think it the moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sort of Self-Murther to ſacrifice the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul to gratify the Appetites of the Body. Bleſs us! Is it poſſible, that when the Neceſſities of Life are ſupplied, a Man would flatter to be rich, or circumvent to be powerful? When we meet a poor Wretch urged with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Cold asking an Alms, we are apt to think this a State we could rather ſtarve than ſubmit to: But yet how much more deſpicable is his Condition who is above Neceſſity, and yet ſhall reſign his Reaſon and his Integrity to purchaſe Superfluities? Theſe are both abject and common Beggars; but ſure it is leſs deſpicable to beg a Supply to a Man's Hunger than his Vanity. But Cuſtom and general Prepoſſeſſions have ſo far prevailed over an unthinking World, that thoſe neceſſitous Creatures who cannot reliſh Life
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0397200204:281"/>
without Applauſe, Attendance, and Equipage, are ſo far from making a contemptible Figure, that diſtreſſed Virtue is leſs eſteemed than ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Vice. But if a Man's Appeal in Caſes that regarded his Honour were made to his own Soul, there would be a Bafis and ſtanding Rule for our Conduct, and we ſhould always endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be than appear honourable. Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> in his Eſſay on <hi>Fortitude,</hi> has treated this Subject with great Wit and Magnanimity. <hi>What</hi> (ſays he) <hi>can be more honourable than to have Courage enough to execute the Commands of Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; to maintain the Dignity of our Nature, and the Station aſſigned us? To be Proof againſt Poverty, Pain, and Death it ſelf? I mean ſo far as not to do any Thing that's ſcandalous or ſinful to avoid them? To ſtand Adverſity under all Shapes with Decency and Reſolution? To do this, is to be great above Title and Fortune. This argues the Soul of an Heavenly Extraction, and is worthy the Offspring of the Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a generous Ambition has this Man point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us? When Men have ſettled in themſelves a Conviction by ſuch noble Precepts, that there is nothing honourable that is not accompanied with Innocence; nothing mean but what has Guilt in it; I ſay, when they have attained thus much, though Poverty, Pain, and Death, may ſtill retain their Terrors, yet Riches, Pleaſures, and Honours, will eaſily loſe their Charms, if they ſtand between us and our Integrity.</p>
               <p>What is here ſaid with Alluſion to Fortune and Fame, may as juſtly be applied to Wit and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for theſe latter are as adventitious as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as little concern the Eſſence of the Soul. They are all laudable in the Man who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes them only for the juſt Application of them. A bright Imagination, while it is ſubſervient to an honeſt and noble Soul, is a Faculty which makes a Man juſtly admired by Mankind, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0397200204:282"/>
furniſhes him with Reflections upon his own Actions, which add Delicates to the Feaſt of a good Conſcience: But when Wit deſcends to wait upon ſenſual Pleaſures, or promote the baſe Purpoſes of Ambition, it is then to be contemned in Proportion to its Excellence. If a Man will not reſolve to place the Foundation of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his own Mind, Life is a bewildered and unhappy State, incapable of Reſt or Tranquillity: For to ſuch a one the general Applauſe of Valour, Wit, nay of Honeſty it ſelf, can give him but a very feeble Comfort, ſince it is capable of being interrupted by any one who wants either Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or Good-nature to ſee or acknowledge ſuch Excellencies. This Rule is ſo neceſſary, that one may very ſafely ſay, it is impoſſible to know any true Reliſh of our Being without it. Look about you in common Life among the ordinary Race of Mankind, and you will find Merit in every Kind is allowed only to thoſe who are in particular Diſtricts or Sets of Company: But ſince Men can have little Pleaſure in theſe Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which denominate them Perſons of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, let them give up ſuch an empty Purſuit, and think nothing eſſential to Happineſs but what is in their own Power, the Capacity of reflecting with Pleaſure on their own Actions, however they are interpreted.</p>
               <p>It is ſo evident a Truth, that it is only in our own Boſoms we are to ſearch for any Thing to make us happy, that it is, methinks, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to our Nature to talk of the taking our Meaſures from thence only as a Matter of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. When all is well there, the Viciſſitudes and Diſtinctions of Life are the meer Scenes of a Drama, and he will never act his Part well who has his Thoughts more fixed upon the Applauſe of the Audience than the Deſign of his Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0397200204:283"/>
The Life of a Man who acts with a ſteady Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, without valuing the Interpretation of his Actions, has but one uniform regular Path to move in, where he cannot meet Oppoſition, or fear Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade. On the other Side, the leaſt Deviation from the Rules of Honour introduces a Train of numberleſs Evils, and involves him in inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mazes. He that has entred into Guilt has bid Adieu to Reſt, and every Criminal has his Share of the Miſery expreſſed ſo emphatically in the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedian;</p>

                     <p>YOur Diſcourſe againſt Drinking, in <hi>Tueſday's Tatler,</hi> I like well enough in the main; but in my humble Opinion, you are become too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid where you ſay to this Effect: [Were there only this ſingle Conſideration, that we are the leſs Maſters of our ſelves if we drink the leaſt Proportion beyond the Exigence of Thirſt.] I hope no one drinks Wine to allay this Appetite. This ſeems to be deſigned for a loftier Indulgence of Nature; for it were hard to ſuppoſe, that the Author of Nature, who impoſed upon her her Neceſſities and Pains, does not allow her her Pleaſures, and we may reckon among the latter the moderate Uſe of the Grape: And though I am as much againſt Exceſs, or whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches it, as your ſelf, yet I conceive one may ſafely go farther than the Bounds you there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, not only without forfeiting the Title of being one's own Maſter, but alſo to poſſeſs it in a much greater Degree. If a Man's expreſſing himſelf upon any Subject with more Life and Vivacity, more Variety of Idea's, more copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more fluently, and more to the Purpoſe, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues it he thinks clearer, ſpeaks more ready, and with greater Choice of comprehenſive and ſignificant Terms. I have the good Fortune now to be intimate with a Gentleman remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for this Temper, who has an inexhauſtible Source of Wit to entertain the Curious, the Grave, the Humorous, and the Frolick. He can transform himſelf into different Shapes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt himſelf to every Company; yet in a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe, or in the ordinary Courſe of Affairs, appears rather dull than ſprightly. You can ſeldom get him to the Tavern, but when once he is is arrived to his Pint, and begins to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and like his Company, you admire a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0397200204:285"/>
Things in him, which before lay buried. Then you diſcover the Brightneſs of his Mind, and the Strength of his Judgment, accompanied with the moſt graceful Mirth. In a Word, by this enlivening Aid, he is whatever is polite, inſtructive, and diverting. What makes him ſtill more agreeable is, that he tells a Story, ſerious or comical, with as much Delicacy of Humour as <hi>Cervantes</hi> himſelf. And for all this, at other Times, even after a long Knowledge of him, you ſhall ſcarce diſcern in this incomparable Perſon a whit more than what might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from one of a common Capacity. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, there are Men of great Parts that are guilty of downright Baſhfulneſs, that by a ſtrange He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation and Reluctance to ſpeak, murder the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and moſt elegant Thoughts, and render the moſt lively Conceptions flat and heavy.</p>
                     <p>In this Caſe, a certain Quantity of my White or Red Cordial, which you will, is an eaſie, but an infallible Remedy. It awakens the Judgment, quickens Memory, ripens Underſtanding, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes Melancholy, chears the Heart; in a Word, reſtores the whole Man to himſelf and his Friends without the leaſt Pain or Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Patient.

               <p>Whatever has been ſaid againſt the Uſe of Wine, upon the Suppoſition that it enfeebles the Mind, and renders it unfit for the Duties of Life, bears forcibly to the Advantage of that delicious Juice, in Caſes where it only heightens Converſation, and brings to Light agreeable Talents, which otherwiſe would have lain concealed under the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0397200204:286"/>
Oppreſſion of an unjuſt Modeſty. I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have ſeen many of the Temper mentioned by this Correſpondent, and own, Wine may very allowably be uſed in a Degree above the Supply of meer Neceſſity by ſuch as labour under Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or are Tongue-ty'd by Modeſty. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a very agreeable Change, when we ſee a Glaſs raiſe a lifeleſs Converſation into all the Pleaſures of Wit and good Humour. But when <hi>Caska</hi> adds to his natural Impudence the Fluſter of a Bottle, that which Fools called Fire when he was ſober, all Men abhor as Outrage when he is drunk. Thus he that in the Morning was only ſaucy, is in the Evening tumultuous. It makes one ſick to hear one of theſe Fellows ſay, They love a Friend and a Bottle. Noiſy Mirth has ſomething too ruſtick in it to be conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Terror by Men of Politeneſs: But while the Diſcourſe improves in a well choſen Company, from the Addition of Spirits which flow from moderate Cups, it muſt be acknowledged, that Leiſure Time cannot be more agreeably, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more uſefully employed than at ſuch Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: But there is a certain Prudence in this and all other Circumſtances which makes Right or Wrong in the Conduct of ordinary Life. Sir <hi>Jeof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Wildacre</hi> has nothing ſo much at Heart as that his Son ſhould know the World betimes: For this End he introduces him among the Sots of his own Age, where the Boy learns to laugh at his Father from the Familiarity with which he ſees him treated by his Equals. This the old Fellow calls Living well with his Heir, and teaching him to be too much his Friend to be impatient for his Eſtate. But for the more exact Regulation of Society in this and other Matters, I ſhall publiſh Tables of the Characters and Relations among Men, and by them inſtruct the Town in making Sets and Companies for a Bottle. This Humour
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0397200204:287"/>
of Sir <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> ſhall be taken Notice of in the firſt Place; for there is, methinks, a Sort of Inceſt in Drunkenneſs, and Sons are not to behold Fathers ſtripped of all Reverence.</p>
               <p>It is ſhocking in Nature for the Young, to ſee thoſe whom they ſhould have an Awe for in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Contempt. I ſhall therefore utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid, that thoſe in whom Nature ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh to avoid too groſs Familiarities, ſhall be received in Parties of Pleaſure where there is the leaſt Danger of Exceſs. I ſhould run through the whole Doctrine of Drinking, but that my Thoughts are at preſent too much employed in the Model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>my Court of Honour;</hi> and altering the Seats, Benches, Bar, and Canopy from that of the Court wherein I laſt Winter ſate upon Cauſes of leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By the Way I ſhall take an Opportunity to examine, what Method is to be taken to make Joiners and other Artificers get out of a Houſe they have once entered, not forgetting to tie them under proper Regulations. It is for Want of ſuch Rules, that I have a Day or two longer than I expected been tormented and deafened with Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, inſomuch that I neither can purſue this Diſcourſe, or anſwer the following and many other Letters of the higheſt Importance.</p>

               <p>THE Court being ſat, an Oath prepared by the Cenſor was adminiſtred to the Aſſiſtants on his Right Hand, who were all ſworn upon their Honour.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff,</hi> after having received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments on his Right Hand, caſt his Eye upon the Left, where the whole Female Jury paid their Reſpects by a low Courteſie, and by laying their Hands upon their Mouths.

               <p>There followed a profound Silence, when at length, after ſome Recollection, the Cenſor, who continued hitherto uncovered, put on his Hat with great Dignity; and after having compoſed the Brims of it in a Manner ſuitable to the Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Character, he gave the following Charge, which was received with Silence and Attention, that being the only Applauſe which he admits of, or is ever given in his Preſence.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Nature of my Office, and the Solemnity of this Occaſion, requiring that I ſhould open my Firſt Seſſion with a Speech, I ſhall caſt what I have to ſay under Two principal Heads.</p>
                  <p>Under the Firſt, I ſhall endeavour to ſhow the Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of this new-erected Court; and under the Second, I ſhall give a Word of Advice and Inſtruction to every conſtituent Part of it.</p>
                  <p>As for the Firſt, it is well obſerved by <hi>Phaedrus</hi> an Heathen Poet,
<q>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0397200204:290"/>
                        <l>Niſi utile eſt quod facimus, fruſtra eſt Gloria.</l>
                     </q>
Which is the ſame, Ladies, as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>It would be of no Reputation for me to be Preſident of a Court which is of no Benefit to the Publick.</hi> Now the Advantages that may ariſe to the Weal-Publick from this Inſtitution will more plainly appear, if we conſider what it ſuffers for the Want of it. Are not our Streets daily filled with wild Pieces of Juſtice and random Penalties? Are not Crimes undetermined, and Reparations diſproportioned? How often have we ſeen the Lye puniſhed by Death, and the Lyar himſelf deciding his own Cauſe? nay, not only acting the Judge, but the Excutioner? Have we not known a Box on the Ear more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely accounted for than Manſlaughter? In theſe Extrajudicial Proceedings of Mankind, an unmannerly Jeſt is frequently as Capital as a premeditated Murder.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt pernicious Circumſtance in this Caſe is, that the Man who ſuffers the Injury muſt put himſelf upon the ſame Foot of Danger with him that gave it, before he can have his juſt Revenge; ſo that the Puniſhment is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidental, and may fall as well upon the Innocent as the Guilty.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only mention a Caſe which happens frequently among the more polite Nations of the World, and which I the rather mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both Sexes are concerned in it, and which therefore you Gentlemen and you Ladies of the Jury will the rather take Notice of; I mean that great and known Caſe of Cuckoldom. Suppoſing the Perſon who has ſuffered Inſults in his dearer and better-Half; ſuppoſing, I ſay, this Perſon ſhould reſent the Injuries done to his tender Wife, What is the Reparation he may expect? Why, to be uſed worſe than his poor Lady, run through the Body, and left
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0397200204:291"/>
Breathleſs upon the Bed of Honour. What then will you on my Right Hand ſay muſt the Man do that is affronted? Muſt our Sides be elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Shins broken? Muſt the Wall, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our Miſtreſs, be taken from us? May a Man knit his Forhead into a Frown, toſs up his Arm, on piſh at what we ſay, and muſt the Villain live after it? Is there no Redreſs for injured Honour? Yes, Gentlemen, that is the Deſign of the Judicature we have here eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
                  <p>A Court of Conſcience, we very well know, was firſt inſtituted for the determining of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points of Property that were too little and trivial for the Cognizance of higher Courts of Juſtice. In the ſame Manner, our Court of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is appointed for the Examination of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Niceties and Punctilio's that do not paſs for Wrongs in the Eye of our common Laws. But notwithſtanding no Legiſlators of any Nation have taken into Conſideration theſe little Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they are ſuch as often lead to Crimes big enough for their Inſpection, though they come before them too late for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I appeal to you, Ladies, <hi>[Here Mr.</hi> Bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſtaff <hi>turned to his Left Hand]</hi> if theſe are not the little Stings and Thorns in Life that make it more uneaſy than its moſt ſubſtantial Evils? Confeſs ingenuouſly, Did you never loſe a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning's Devotions becauſe you could not offer them up from the higheſt Place of the Pew? Have you not been in Pain, even at a Ball, becauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has been taken out to dance before you? Do you love any of your Friends ſo much as thoſe that are below you? Or have you any Favourites that walk on your Right Hand? You have anſwered me in your Looks, I ask no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0397200204:292"/>
I come now to the Second Part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which obliges me to addreſs my ſelf in particular to the reſpective Members of the Court, in which I ſhall be very brief.</p>
                  <p>As for you, Gentlemen and Ladies my Aſſiſtants and Grand Juries, I have made Choice of you on my Right Hand, becauſe I know you very jealous of your Honour; and you on my Left, becauſe I know you very much concerned for the Reputation of others; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I expect great Exactneſs and Impartiality in your Verdicts and Judgments.</p>
                  <p>I muſt in the next Place addreſs my ſelf to you, Gentlemen of the Council: You all know, that I have not choſen you for your Knowledge in the litigious Parts of the Law, but becauſe you have all of you formerly fought Duels, of which I have Reaſon to think you have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being now ſettled in the peaceable State of Benchers. My Advice to you is, only that in your Pleadings you are ſhort and expreſſive: To which End you are to baniſh out of your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes all ſynonymous Terms, and unneceſſary Multiplications of Verbs and Nouns. I do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over forbid you the Uſe of the Words <hi>alſo</hi> and <hi>likewiſe;</hi> and muſt further declare, That if I catch any one among you, upon any Pretence whatſoever, uſing the Particle <hi>or,</hi> I ſhall inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly order him to be ſtripped of his Gown, and thrown over the Bar.</p>

               <p>THere are no Books which I more delight in than in Travels, eſpecially thoſe that deſcribe remote Countries, and give the Writer an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhowing his Parts without incurring any Danger of being examined or contradicted. Among all the Authors of this Kind, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Countryman Sir <hi>John Mandeville</hi> has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed himſelf, by the Copiouſneſs of his Invention, and Greatneſs of his Genius. The Second to Sir <hi>John</hi> I take to have been <hi>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,</hi> a Perſon of infinite Adventure, and unbounded Imagination. One reads the Voyages of theſe Two great Wits with as much Aſtoniſhment as the Travels of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> or of the <hi>Red Croſs</hi> Knight in <hi>Spencer.</hi> All is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Ground, and Fairy Land.</p>
               <p>I have got into my Hands by great Chance ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Manuſcripts of theſe Two eminent Authors, which are filled with greater Wonders than any of thoſe they have communicated to the Publick; and indeed, were they not ſo well atteſted, would appear altogether improbable. I am apt to think, the ingenious Authors did not publiſh them with the reſt of their Works, leſt they ſhould paſs for Fictions and Fables: A Caution not unneceſſary, when the Reputation of their Veracity was not yet eſtabliſhed in the World. But as this Reaſon has now no further Weight.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0397200204:294"/>
I ſhall make the Publick a Preſent of theſe curious Pieces at ſuch Times as I ſhall find my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided with other Subjects.</p>
               <p>The preſent Paper I intend to fill with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Journal, in which that learned and worthy Knight gives an Account of the Freezing and Thawing of ſeveral ſhort Speeches which he made in the Territories of <hi>Nova Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla.</hi> I need not inform my Reader, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Hudibras</hi> alludes to this ſtrange Quality in that cold Climate, when, ſpeaking of abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Notions cloathed in a viſible Shape, he adds that apt Simile,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Like Words congeal'd in Northern Air.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Not to keep my Reader any longer in Suſpence, the Relation put into modern Language is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <p>We were ſeparated by a Storm in the Latitude of 73, inſomuch that only the Ship which I was in, with a <hi>Dutch</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, got ſafe into a Creek of <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi> We landed, in order to reſit our Veſſels, and ſtore our ſelves with Proviſions. The Crew of each Veſſel made themſelves a Cabbin of Turf and Wood, at ſome Diſtance from each other, to fence themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Inclemencies of the Weather, which was ſevere beyond Imagination. We ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in talking to one another we loſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our Words, and could not hear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at above Two Yards Diſtance, and that too when we ſat very near the Fire. After much Perplexity, I found that our Words froze in the Air before they could reach the Ears of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom they were ſpoken. I was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this Conjecture, when, upon the Increaſe of the Cold, the whole Company grew dumb, or rather deaf; for every Man was ſenſible, as we afterwards found, that he ſpoke as well as ever; but the Sounds no ſooner took Air, than
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0397200204:295"/>
they were condenſed and loſt. It was now a miſerable Spectacle to ſee us nodding and gaping at one another, every Man talking, and no Man heard. One might obſerve a Seaman, that could hail a Ship at a League diſtance, beckoning with his Hands, ſtraining his Lungs, and tearing his Throat, but all in vain.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Nec vox, nec Verba, ſequuntur.</l>
               </q>
               <p>We continued here Three Weeks in this diſmal Plight. At length, upon a Turn of Wind, the Air about us began to thaw. Our Cabbin was immediately filled with a dry clattering Sound, which I afterwards found to be the Crackling of Conſonants that broke above our Heads, and were often mixed with a gentle Hiſſing, which I imputed to the Letter <hi>S,</hi> that occurs ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue. I ſoon after felt a Breeze of Whiſpers ruſhing by my Ear; for thoſe being of a ſoft and gentle Subſtance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately liquefied in the warm Wind that blew acroſs our Cabbin. Theſe were ſoon followed by Syllables and ſhort Words, and at length by entire Sentences, that melted ſooner or later, as they were more or leſs congealed; ſo that we now heard every Thing that had been <hi>ſpoken</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Three Weeks that we had been <hi>ſilent,</hi> if I may uſe that Expreſſion. It was now very early in the Morning, and yet, to my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, I heard ſome Body ſay, <hi>Sir</hi> John, <hi>it is Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and Time for the Ship's Crew to go to Bed.</hi> This I knew to be the Pilot's Voice, and upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting my ſelf, I concluded that he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe Words to me ſome Days before, though I could not hear them before the preſent Thaw. My Reader will eaſily imagine how the whole Crew was amazed, to hear every Man talking, and ſee no Man opening his Mouth. In the Midſt of this great Surprize we were all in, we heard a Volley of Oaths and Curſes, laſting for
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0397200204:296"/>
a long while, and uttered in a very hoarſe Voice, which I knew belonged to the Boatſwain, who was a very cholerick Fellow, and had taken his Opportunity of Curſing and Swearing at me when he thought I could not hear him; for I had ſeveral Times given him the Strappado on that Account, as I did not fail to repeat it for theſe his pious Soliloquies when I got him on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit the Names of ſeveral Beauties in <hi>Wapping,</hi> which were heard every now and then, in the Midſt of a long Sigh that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them; as, Dear <hi>Kate!</hi> Pretty Mrs. <hi>Peggy!</hi> When ſhall I ſee my <hi>Sue</hi> again? This betray'd ſeveral Amours which had been concealed till that Time, and furniſhed us with a great deal of Mirth in our Return to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this Confuſion of Voices was pretty well over, though I was afraid to offer at Speaking, as fearing I ſhould not be heard, I propoſed a Viſit to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cabbin, which lay about a Mile further up into the Country. My Crew were extreamly rejoiced to find they had again recovered their Hearing, though every Man ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Voice with the ſame Apprehenſions that I had done!</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Et timide Verba intermiſſa retentat.</l>
               </q>
               <p>At about half a Mile's Diſtance from our Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, we heard the Groanings of a Bear, which at firſt ſtartled us; but upon Enquiry we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome of our Company, that he was dead, and now lay in Salt, having been killed upon that very Spot about a Fortnight before, in the Time of the Froſt. Not far from the ſame Place we were likewiſe entertained with ſome poſthumous Snarls and Barkings of a Fox.</p>
               <p>We at length arrived at the little <hi>Dutch</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and upon entering the Room, found it filled
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0397200204:297"/>
with Sighs that ſmelt of Brandy, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſavourly Sounds that were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate. My Valet, who was an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> fell into ſo great a Rage at what he heard, that he drew his Sword; but not knowing where to lay the Blame, he put it up again. We were ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with theſe confuſed Noiſes, but did not hear a ſingle Word till about half an Hour after; which I aſcribed to the harſh and obdurate Sounds of that Language, which wanted more Time than ours to melt and become audible.</p>
               <p>After having here met with a very hearty Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, we went to the <hi>French</hi> Cabbin, who, to make Amends for their Three Weeks Silence, were Talking and Diſputing with greater Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Confuſion than ever I heard in an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly even of that Nation. Their Language as I found, upon the firſt Giving of the Weather, ſell aſunder and diſſolved. I was here convinced of an Error into which I had before fallen; for I fancied, that for the Freezing of the Sound, it was neceſſary for it to be wrapped up, and, as it were, preſerved in Breath; but I found my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, when I heard the Sound of a Kit playing a Minuet over our Heads. I asked the Occaſion of it; upon which one of the Company told me, that it would play there above a Week longer if the Thaw continued; for, ſays he, finding our ſelves bereft of Speech, we prevailed upon one of the Company, who had this Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about him, to play to us from Morning to Night; all which Time we employed in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, in order to diſſipate our Chagrin, &amp; <hi>tuer le Temps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>John</hi> gives very good Philoſophical Reaſons why the Kit could be heard during the Froſt; but as they are ſomething Prolix, I paſs them over in Silence, and ſhall only obſerve, that the honourable Author ſeems, by his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to have been well verſed in the ancient

               <p>The Caſe of this Gentleman deſerves Pity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he loves Sweetmeats, to which, if I may gueſs by his Letter, he is no Enemy. In the mean Time, I have often wondered at the Indecency of diſcarding the holieſt Man from the Table as ſoon as the moſt delicious Parts of the Entertainment are ſerved up, and could never conceive a Reaſon for ſo abſurd a Cuſtom. Is it becauſe a liquoriſh Palate, or a ſweet Tooth (as they call it) is not conſiſtent with the Sanctity of his Character? This is but a trifling Pretence. No Man of the moſt rigid Virtue gives Offence by any Exceſſes in Plumb-Pudding or Plumb-Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, and that, becauſe they are the firſt Parts of the Dinner. Is there any Thing that tends to Incitation in Sweetmeats more than in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſhes? Certainly not. Sugar-Plumbs are a very innocent Diet, and Conſerves of a much colder Nature than your common Pickles. I have ſometimes thought, that the Ceremony of the Chaplain's flying away from the Deſſert was Typical and Figurative, to mark out to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany how they ought to retire from all the luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Baits of Temptation, and deny their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites the Gratifications that are moſt pleaſing to them; or at leaſt to ſignify, that we ought to ſtint our ſelves in our moſt lawful Satisfactions, and not make our Pleaſure, but our Support, the End of Eating: But moſt certainly, if ſuch a Leſſon of Temperance had been neceſſary at a Table, our Clergy would have recommended it to all the Lay-Maſters of Families, and not have diſturbed other Men's Tables with ſuch unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Examples of Abſtinence.

Strange! that a Sirloin of Beef, whether boiled or roaſted, when entire, is expoſed to his utmoſt Depredations and Inciſions; but if minced into ſmall Pieces, and toſſed up with Plumbs and Sugar, changes its Property, and, forſooth, is Meat for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>

                  <hi>PEter Plumb,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Merchant, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Thomas Gules,</hi> of <hi>Gule-Hall</hi> in the Country of <hi>Salop,</hi> for that the ſaid <hi>Peter Plumb</hi> did in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet, London,</hi> between the Hours of Two and Three in the Afternoon, meet the ſaid Mr. <hi>Thomas Gules,</hi> and after a ſhort Salutation, put on his Hat, Value Five-Pence, while the Honourable Mr. <hi>Gules</hi> ſtood bare-headed for the Space of Two Seconds. It was further urged againſt the Criminal, That during his Diſcourſe with the Proſecutor, he fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniouſly ſtole the Wall of him, having clapped his Back againſt it in ſuch a Manner that it was impoſſible for Mr. <hi>Gules</hi> to recover it again at his taking Leave of him. The Proſecutor alledged, That he was the Cadet of a very ancient Family; and that according to the Principles of all the younger Brothers of the ſaid Family, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſullied himſelf with Buſineſs, but had choſen rather to ſtarve like a Man of Honour, than do any Thing beneath his Quality. He produced ſeveral Witneſſes, that he had never employed himſelf beyond the Twiſting of a Whip, or the Making of a Pair of Nut-Crackers, in which he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0397200204:304"/>
only worked for his Diverſion, in order to mae a Preſent now and then to his Friends. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner being asked what he could ſay for himſelf, caſt ſeveral Reflections upon the Honourable Mr. <hi>Gules;</hi> as, That he was not worth a Groat; That no Body in the City would truſt him for a Halſpenny; That he owed him Money, which he had promiſed to pay him ſeveral Times, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kept his Word: And in ſhort, That he was an idle, beggarly Fellow, and of no Uſe to the Publick. This Sort of Language was very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reprimanded by the Cenſor, who told the Criminal, That he ſpoke in Contempt of the Court, and that he ſhould be proceeded againſt for Contumacy, if he did not change his Style. The Priſoner therefore deſired to be heard by his Council, who urged in his Defence, That he put on his Hat through Ignorance, and took the Wall by Accident. They likewiſe produced ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Witneſſes, That he made ſeveral Motions with his Hat in his Hand, which are generally underſtood as an Invitation to the Perſon we talk with to be covered; and that the Gentleman not taking the Hint, he was forced to put on his Hat, as being troubled with a Cold. There was likewiſe an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Man who depoſed, That he had heard him cough Three and twenty times that Morning. And as for the Wall, it was alledged That he had taken it inadvertently, to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a Shower of Rain which was then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The Cenſor having conſulted the Men of Honour who ſat at his Right Hand on the Bench, found they were all of Opinion, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence made by the Priſoner's Council did rather aggravate than extenuate his Crime; That the Motions and Intimations of the Hat were a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Superiority in Converſation, and therefore not to be uſed by the Criminal to a Man of the Proſecutor's Quality, who was likewiſe veſted with a double Title to the Wall at the Time of

The Jury therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and being willing to comply with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Cenſor, after an Hour's Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declared their Opinion as follows:</p>
               <p>That in Conſideration this was <hi>Peter Plumb</hi>'s firſt Offence, and that there did not appear any <hi>Malice prepenſe</hi> in it, as alſo that he lived in good Reputation among his Neighbours, and that his taking the Wall was only <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor ſhould let him eſcape with Life, and content himſelf with the Slitting of his Noſe, and the Cutting off both his Ears. Mr. <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff</hi> ſmiling upon the Court, told them, That he thought the Puniſhment, even under its preſent Mitigation, too ſevere; and that ſuch Penalties might be of ill Conſequence in a Trading Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He therefore pronounced Sentence againſt the Criminal in the following Manner: That his Hat, which was the Inſtrument of Offence, ſhould be forfeited to the Court; That the Criminal ſhould go to the Warehouſe from whence he came, and thence, as Occaſion ſhould require, proceed to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or <hi>Garraway</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, in what Manner he pleaſed; but that neither he nor any of the Family of the

After ſome Time they returned, and gave their Verdict, That it appearing the Perſons at the Bar did neither of them wear a Sword, and that conſequently they had no Right to quarrel upon a Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; to prevent ſuch frivolous Appeals for the future, they ſhould both of them be toſſed in the ſame Blanket, and there adjuſt the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Newman</hi> was indicted by Major <hi>Punto,</hi> for having uſed the Words, <hi>Perhaps it may be ſo,</hi> in a Diſpute with the ſaid Major. The Major urged, That the Word, <hi>Perhaps,</hi> was queſtioning his Veracity, and that it was an indirect Manner of giving him the Lye. <hi>Richard Newman</hi> had nothing more to ſay for himſelf, than that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no ſuch Thing, and threw himſelf upon the Mercy of the Court.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> ſtood up, and after having caſt his Eyes over the whole Aſſembly, hem'd thrice. He then acquainted them, That he had laid down a Rule to himſelf, which he was reſolved never to depart from, and which, as he conceived, would very much conduce to the ſhortening the Buſineſs of the Court; I mean, ſays he, never to allow of the Lye being given by Conſtruction, Implication, or Induction, but by the ſole Uſe of the Word it ſelf. He then proceeded to ſhow the great Miſchiefs that had ariſen to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation from that pernicious Monoſyllable; That it had bred the moſt fatal Quarrels between the deareſt Friends; That it had frequently thin'd the Guards, and made great Havock in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; That it had ſometimes weaken'd the City Trained Bands; and, in a Word, had deſtroved many of the braveſt Men in the Iſle of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> For the Prevention of which Evils for the future, he inſtructed the Jury to <hi>preſent</hi> the Word it ſelf as a Nuſance in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and further promiſed them, That he would, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch their Preſentment, publiſh an Edict of the Court for the entire Baniſhment and Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it out of the Diſcourſes and Converſation of all civil Societies.</p>

               <p>EVery Nation is diſtinguiſhed by Productions that are peculiar to it. <hi>Great Britain</hi> is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly fruitful in Religions, that ſhoot up and flouriſh in this Climate more than in any other. We are ſo famous Abroad for our great Variety of Sects and Opinions, that an ingenious Friend of mine, who is lately returned from his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, aſſures me, there is a Show at this Time <hi>carried</hi> up and down in <hi>Germany,</hi> which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents all the Religions of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. Notwithſtanding that the Pliancy of the Matter in which the Images are wrought makes it capable of being moulded into all Shapes and Figures, my Friend tells me, that he did not think it poſſible for it to be twiſted and tortured into ſo many skrew'd Faces and wry Features as appeared in ſeveral of the Figures that compoſed the Show. I was indeed ſo pleaſed with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>German</hi> Artiſt, that I begged my Friend to give me an Account of it in all its Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which he did after the following Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0397200204:309"/>
I have often, ſays he, been preſent at a Show of Elephants, Camels, Dromedaries, and other ſtrange Creatures, but I never ſaw ſo great an Aſſembly of Spectators as were met together at the Opening of this great Piece of Wax-work. We were all placed in a large Hall, according to the Price that we had paid for our Seats: The Curtain that hung before the Show was made by a Maſter of Tapeſtry, who had woven it in the Figure of a monſtrous <hi>Hydra</hi> that had ſeveral Heads, which brandiſhed out their Tongues, and ſeemed to hiſs at each other. Some of theſe Heads were large and entire; and where any of them had been lopped away, there ſprouted up ſeveral in the Room of them; inſomuch that for one Head cut off, a Man might ſee Ten, Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or an Hundred, of a ſmaller Size, creeping through the Wound. In ſhort, the whole Picture was nothing but Confuſion and Bloodſhed. On a ſudden, ſays my Friend, I was ſtartled with a Flouriſh of many Muſical Inſtruments that I had never heard before, which was followed by a ſhort Tune, (if it might be ſo called) wholly made up of Jars and Diſcords. Among the reſt, there was an Organ, a Bagpipe, a Groaning-Board, a Stentorophonick-Trumpet, with ſeveral Wind Inſtruments of a moſt diſagreeable Sound, which I do not ſo much as know the Name of. After a ſhort Flouriſh, the Curtain was drawn up, and we were preſented with the moſt extraordinary Aſſembly of Figures that ever entered into a Man's Imagination. The Deſign of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſo well expreſſed in the dumb Show before us, that it was not hard for an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to comprehend the Meaning of it.</p>
               <p>The principal Figures were placed in a Row, conſiſting of Seven Perſons. The middle Figure, which immediately attracted the Eyes of the whole Company, and was much bigger than the reſt, was formed like a Matron, dreſſed in the Habit
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0397200204:310"/>
of an elderly Woman of Quality in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s Days. The moſt remarkable Parts of her Dreſs, was the Beaver with the Steeple Crown, the Scarf that was darker than Sable, and the Lawn Apron that was whiter than Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. Her Gown was of the richeſt black Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, and juſt upon her Heart ſtudded with large Diamonds of an ineſtimable Value, diſpoſed in the Form of a Croſs. She bore an inexpreſſible Chearfulneſs and Dignity in her Aſpect; and though ſhe ſeemed in Years, appeared with ſo much Spirit and Vivacity, as gave her at the ſame Time an Air of old Age and Immortality. I found my Heart touched with ſo much Love and Reverence at the Sight of her, that the Tears ran down my Face as I looked upon her; and ſtill the more I looked upon her, the more my Heart was melted with the Sentiments of Filial Tenderneſs and Duty. I diſcovered every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſomething ſo charming in this Figure, that I could ſcarce take my Eyes off it. On its Right Hand there ſat the Figure of a Woman ſo covered with Ornaments, that her Face, her Body, and her Hands, were almoſt entirely hid under them. The little you could ſee of her Face was painted; and what I thought very odd, had ſomething in it like artificial Wrinkles; but I was the leſs ſurpriſed at it, when I ſaw upon her Forehead an old-faſhioned Tower of grey Hairs. Her Head-Dreſs roſe very high by Three ſeveral Stories or Degrees; her Garments had a Thouſand Colours in them, and were embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Croſſes in Gold, Silver and Silk: She had nothing on, ſo much as a Glove or a Slipper, which was not marked with this Figure; nay, ſo ſuperſtitiouſly fond did ſhe appear of it, that ſhe ſat croſs-legged. I was quickly ſick of this tawdry Compoſition of Ribands, Silks and Jewels, and therefore caſt my Eye on a Dame which was juſt the Reverſe of it. I need not tell
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0397200204:311"/>
my Reader, that the Lady before deſcribed was <hi>Popery,</hi> or that ſhe I am now going to deſcribe is <hi>Presbytery.</hi> She ſat on the Left Hand of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Matron, and ſo much reſembled her in the Features of her Countenance, that ſhe ſeemed her Siſter; but at the ſame Time that one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Likneſs in her Beauty, one could not but take Notice, that there was ſomething in it ſickly and ſplenatick. Her Face had enough to diſcover the Relation, but it was drawn up into a peeviſh Figure, ſowred with Diſcontent, and overcaſt with Melancholy. She ſeemed offended at the Matron for the Shape of her Hat, as too much reſembling the triple Coronet of the Perſon who ſat by her. One might ſee likewiſe, that ſhe diſſented from the white Apron and the Croſs; for which Reaſons ſhe had made her ſelf a plain, homely Dowdy, and turned her Face towards the Sectaries that ſat on her Left Hand, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of looking upon the Matron, leſt ſhe ſhould ſee the Harlot by her.</p>
               <p>On the Right Hand of <hi>Popery</hi> ſat <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by an old Man embroidered with Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries, and diſtinguiſhed by many Typical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which I had not Skill enough to unriddle. He was placed among the Rubbiſh of a Temple; but inſtead of weeping over it, (which I ſhould have expected from him) he was counting out a Bag of Money upon the Ruins of it.</p>
               <p>On his Right Hand was <hi>Deiſm,</hi> or <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> This was a Figure of an half-naked auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Country Wench, who with proper Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Education would have made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and beautiful Appearance; but for Want of thoſe Advantages, was ſuch a Spectacle, as a Man would bluſh to look upon.</p>
               <p>I have now, continued my Friend, given you an Account of thoſe who were placed on the Right Hand of the Matron, and who, according to the Order in which they ſat, were <hi>Deiſm, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0397200204:312"/>
and <hi>Popery.</hi> On the Left Hand, as I told you, appeared <hi>Presbytery.</hi> The next to her was a Figure which ſomewhat puzzled me: It was that of a Man looking, with Horror in his Eyes, upon a Silver Baſon filled with Water. Obſerving ſomething in his Countenance that looked like Lunacy, I fancied at firſt that he was to expreſs that kind of Diſtraction which the Phyſicians call the <hi>Hydro-Phobia;</hi> but conſidering what the Intention of the Show was, I immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected my ſelf, and concluded it to be <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Figure was a Man that ſat under a moſt profound Compoſure of Mind: He wore an Hat whoſe Brims were exactly parallel with the Horizon: His Garment had neither Sleeve nor Skirt, nor ſo much as a ſuperfluous Button. What they called his Cravat, was a little Piece of white Linen quilled with great Exactneſs, and hanging below his Chin about two Inches. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Book in his Hand, I asked our Artiſt what it was, who told me it was the <hi>Quakers</hi> Religion; upon which I deſired a Sight of it. Upon Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, I found it to be nothing but a new-faſhioned Grammar, or an Art of abridging ordinary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The Nouns were reduced to a very ſmall Number, as the <hi>Light, Friend, Babylon.</hi> The principal of his Pronouns was <hi>Thou;</hi> and as for You, Ye, and Yours, I found they were not looked upon as Parts of Speech in this Grammar. All the Verbs wanted the Second Perſon Plural; the Participles ended all in <hi>ing</hi> or <hi>ed,</hi> which were marked with a particular Accent. There were no Adverbs beſides <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay.</hi> The ſame Thrift was obſerved in the Prepoſitions. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions were only <hi>Hem!</hi> and <hi>Ha!</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjections brought under the Three Heads of Sighing, Sobbing, and Groaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0397200204:313"/>
There was at the End of the Grammar a little Nomenclature, call'd, <hi>The Chriſtian Man's Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulary,</hi> which gave new Appellations, or (if you will) Chriſtian Names to almoſt every Thing in Life. I replaced the Book in the Hand of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, not without admiring the Simplicity of its Garb, Speech, and Behaviour.</p>
               <p>Juſt oppoſite to this Row of Religions, there was a Statue dreſſed in a Fool's Coat, with a Cap of Bells upon his Head, laughing and pointing at the Figures that ſtood before him. This Ideot is ſuppoſed to ſay in his Heart what <hi>David</hi>'s Fool did ſome Thouſands of Years ago, and was therefore deſigned as a proper Repreſentative of thoſe among us who are called Atheiſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels by others, and Free-Thinkers by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>There were many other Groupes of Figures which I did not know the Meaning of; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Collection of both Sexes turning their Backs upon the Company, and laying their Heads very cloſe together, I enquired after their Religion, and found that they called themſelves the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians,</hi> or the Family of Love.</p>
               <p>In the oppoſite Corner there ſat another little Congregation of ſtrange Figures, opening their Mouths as wide as they could gape, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Title of the <hi>Sweet Singers of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt not omit, that in this Aſſembly of Wax there were ſeveral Pieces that moved by Clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and gave great Satisfaction to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Behind the Matron there ſtood one of theſe Figures, and behind <hi>Popery</hi> another, which, as the Artiſt told us, were each of them the Genius of the Perſon they attended. That behind <hi>Popery</hi> repreſented <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and the other <hi>Moderation.</hi> The firſt of theſe moved by ſecret Springs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a great Heap of dead Bodies that lay piled upon one another at a conſiderable Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the principal Figures. There were written

This was followed by great Claſhings and Noiſe, when, in the Midſt of the Tumult, the Figure of <hi>Moderation</hi> moved gently towards this new Army, which upon her holding up a Paper in her Hand, inſcribed, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience,</hi> immediately fell into a Heap of Carcaſſes, remaining in the ſame quiet Poſture that they lay at firſt.</p>

                     <p>GRatitude obliges me to make this publick Acknowledgment of the eminent Service you have done my ſelf in particular, and the whole Body of Chaplains (I hope) in general. Coming Home on <hi>Sunday</hi> about Dinner-time, I found Things ſtrangely altered for the better; the Porter ſmiled in my Face when he let me in, the Footman bowed to me as I paſſed him, the Steward ſhook me by the Hand, and Mrs. <hi>Beatrice</hi> drop'd me a Courteſie as ſhe went along. I was ſurprized at all this Civility, and knew not to what I might aſcribe it, except to my bright Beaver and ſhining Scarf that were new that Day. But I was ſtill more aſtoniſhed to find ſuch an agreeable Change at the Table: My Lord helped me to a fat Slice of Veniſon with his own Hand, and my Lady did me the Honour to drink to me. I offered to riſe at my uſual Time, but was deſired to fit ſtill, with this kind Expreſſion: Come Doctor, a Gelly or a Conſerve will do you no Harm; don't be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Deſſert. I was ſo confounded with the Favour, that I returned my Thanks in a moſt aukward Manner, wondering what was the Meaning of this total Transformation: But

The
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0397200204:320"/>
Priſoner pleaded Inadvertency; and the Jury were going to bring it in Chance-medley, had not ſeveral Witneſſes been produced againſt the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth Makebate,</hi> that ſhe was an old Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and a Woman of a bad Reputation. It appeared in particular, That on the <hi>Sunday</hi> before ſhe had detracted from a new Petticoat of Mrs. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doelittle,</hi> having ſaid in the Hearing of ſeveral credible Witneſſes, that the ſaid Petticoat was ſcowred, to the great Grief and Detriment of the ſaid <hi>Mary Doelittle.</hi> There were likewiſe many Evidences produced againſt the Criminal, that though ſhe never failed to come to Church on <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſhe was a moſt notorious Sabbath-Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and that ſhe ſpent her whole Time, during Divine Service, in diſparaging other People's Clothes, and whiſpering to thoſe who ſat next her. Upon the whole, ſhe was found guilty of the Indictment, and received Sentence to ask Pardon of the Proſecutor upon her bare Knees, without either Cuſhion or Haſſock under her, in the Face of the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> As ſoon as the Sentence was executed on the Criminal, which was done in open Court with the utmoſt Severity, the firſt Lady of the Bench on Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi>'s Right Hand ſtood up, and made a Motion to the Court, That whereas it was impoſſible for Women of Faſhion to dreſs themſelves before the Church was half done, and whereas many Confuſions and Inconveniencies did ariſe thereupon, it might be lawful for them to ſend a Footman, in order to keep their Places, as was uſual in other polite and well regulated Aſſemblies. The Motion was ordered to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Books, and conſidered at a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles Cambrick,</hi> Linendraper, in the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> was indicted for ſpeaking obſcenely to the Lady <hi>Penolope Youthwood.</hi> It appeared, That the Proſecutor and her Woman going in a
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0397200204:321"/>
Stage-Coach from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Brentford,</hi> where they were to be met by the Lady's own Chariot, the Criminal and another of his Acquaintance travelled with them in the ſame Coach, at which Time the Priſoner talked Bawdy for the Space of Three Miles and a half. The Proſecutor alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That over againſt the <hi>Old Fox</hi> at <hi>Knightſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> he mentioned the Word Linen; That at the further End of <hi>Kenſington</hi> he made Uſe of the Term Smock; and that before he came to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſmith,</hi> he talked almoſt a Quarter of an Hour upon Wedding-Shifts. The Proſecutor's Woman confirmed what her Lady had ſaid, and added further, That ſhe had never ſeen her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in ſo great a Confuſion, and in ſuch a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as ſhe was during the whole Diſcourſe of the Criminal. The Priſoner had little to ſay for himſelf, but that he talked only in his own Trade, and meant no Hurt by what he ſaid. The Jury however found him guilty, and repreſented by their Forewoman, That ſuch Diſcourſes were apt to ſully the Imagination, and that by a Concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Idea's, the Word Linen implied many Things that were not proper to be ſtirred up in the Mind of a Woman who was of the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Quality, and therefore gave it as their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, That the Linendraper ſhould loſe his Tongue. Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> ſaid, he thought the Proſecutor's Ears were as much to blame as the Priſoner's Tongue, and therefore gave Sentence as follows: That they ſhould both be placed over-againſt one another in the Midſt of the Court, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for the Space of one Quarter of an Hour, during which Time, the Linendraper was to be gagged, and the Lady to hold her Hands cloſe upon both her Ears, which was executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Callicoat</hi> was indicted as an Accomplice to <hi>Charles Cambrick,</hi> for that he the ſaid <hi>Edward Callicoat</hi> did, by his Silence and his Smiles, ſeem
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0397200204:322"/>
to approve and abet the ſaid <hi>Charles Cambrick</hi> in every Thing he ſaid. It appeared, That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was Foreman of the Shop to the aforeſaid <hi>Charles Cambrick,</hi> and by his Poſt obliged to ſmile at every Thing that the other ſhould be pleaſed to ſay: Upon which he was acquitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſias Shallow</hi> was indicted in the Name of Dame <hi>Winifred,</hi> ſole Relict of <hi>Richard Dainty</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for having ſaid ſeveral Times in Company, and in the Hearing of ſeveral Perſons there preſent, That he was extremely obliged to the Widow <hi>Dainty,</hi> and that he ſhould never be able ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to expreſs his Gratitude. The Proſecutor urged, That this might blaft her Reputation, and that it was in Effect a boaſting of Favours which he had never received. The Priſoner ſeemed to be much aſtoniſhed at the Conſtruction which was put upon his Words, and ſaid, That he meant nothing by them, but that the Widow had befriended him in a Leaſe, and was very kind to his younger Siſter. The Jury finding him a little weak in his Underſtanding, without going out of the Court, brought in their Verdict <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urſula Goodenough</hi> was accuſed by the Lady <hi>Betty Wou'dbe,</hi> for having ſaid, That ſhe the Lady <hi>Betty Wou'dbe</hi> was painted. The Priſoner brought ſeveral Perſons of good Credit to witneſs to her Reputation, and proved by undeniable Evidences, that ſhe was never at the Place where the Words were ſaid to have been uttered. The Cenſor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Behaviour of the Proſecutor, found Reaſon to believe that ſhe had indicted the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for no other Reaſon but to make her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion be taken Notice of, which indeed was very freſh and beautiful: He therefore asked the Offender with a very ſtern Voice, How ſhe could preſume to ſpread ſo groundleſs a Report? And whether ſhe ſaw any Colours in the Lady <hi>Wou'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi>'s Face that could procure Credit to ſuch a
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0397200204:323"/>
Falſhood? Do you ſee (ſays he) any Lillies or Roſes in her Cheeks, any Bloom, any Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?—The Proſecutor, not able to bear ſuch Language any longer, told him, That he talked like a blind old Fool, and that ſhe was aſham'd to have entertain'd any Opinion of his Wiſdom: But ſhe was ſoon put to Silence, and ſentenced to wear her Mask for Five Months, and not to preſume to ſhow her Face till the Town ſhould be empty.</p>

                  <hi>Benjamin Buzzard</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was indicted for having told the Lady <hi>Everbloom</hi> at a publick Ball, That ſhe looked very well for a Woman of her Years.

               <p>Notwithſtanding that there is nothing obſcene in Natural Knowledge, and that I intend to give as little Offence as may be to Readers of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Imagination, I muſt, for my own Quiet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Criticks (who in all Times have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for good Noſes) to refrain from the Lecture of this curious Tract. Theſe Gentlemen were formerly marked out and diſtinguiſhed by the little Rhinocerical Noſe, which was always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as an Inſtrument of Deriſion, and which they were uſed to cock, toſs, or draw up in a contemptuous Manner, upon reading the Works of their ingenious Contemporaries. It is not therefore for this Generation of Men that I write the preſent Tranſaction,<q>

               <p>Many are the Opinions of learned Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Riſe of that fatal Diſtemper which has always taken a particular Pleaſure in venting its Spight upon the Noſe.

Poem ſays, ſhe came to him in the Diſguiſe of a Suttling Wench, with a Bottle of Brandy under her Arm. Let that be as it will, he managed Matters ſo well, that ſhe went away big-bellied, and was at length brought to Bed of a little <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.</hi> This Boy, whether it were by Reaſon of any bad Food that his Father had eaten during the Siege, or of any particular Malignity in the Stars that reigned at his Nativity, came into the World with a very ſickly Look, and crazy Conſtitution. As ſoon as he was able to handle his Bow, he made Diſcoveries of a moſt perverſe Diſpoſition. He dipped all his Arrows in Poiſon, that rotted every Thing they touched; and what was more particular, aimed all his Shafts at the Noſe, quite contrary to the Practice of his elder Brothers, who had made a humane Heart their Burt in all Countries and Ages. To break him of this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Trick, his Parents put him to School to <hi>Mercury,</hi> who did all he could to hinder him from demoliſhing the Noſes of Mankind; but in Spight of Education, the Boy continued very unlucky; and tho' his Malice was a little ſoftened by good Inſtructions, he would very frequently let fly an invenomed Arrow, and wound his Votaries oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Noſe than in the Heart. Thus far the Fable.</p>
               <p>I need not tell my learned Reader, that <hi>Correg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> has drawn a <hi>Cupid</hi> taking his Leſſon from <hi>Mercury,</hi> conformable to this Poem; nor that the Poem it ſelf was deſigned as a Burleſque upon <hi>Fracaſtorius.</hi>

                  </hi> and in ſhort, do all the Functions of a Genuine and Natural Noſe. There was however one Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in this Experiment: The <hi>Portugueſe's</hi> Complexion was a little upon the Subfusk, with very black Eyes and dark Eyebrows; and the Noſe being taken from a Porter that had a white <hi>German</hi> Skin, and cut out of thoſe Parts that are not expoſed to the Sun, it was very viſible that the Features of his Face were not Fellows. In a Word, the <hi>Comdé</hi> reſembled one of thoſe maimed antique Statues that has often a modern Noſe of freſh Marble glewed to a Face of ſuch a yellow Ivory Complexion as nothing can give but Age. To remedy this Particular for the future, the Doctor got together a great Collection of Porters, Men of all Complexions, black, brown, fair, dark, ſallow, pale, and ruddy; ſo that it was impoſſible for a Patient of the moſt out-of-the-way Colour not to find a Noſe to match it.</p>
               <p>The Doctor's Houſe was now very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and become a Kind of College, or rather Hoſpital, for the faſhionable Cripples of both Sexes that reſorted to him from all Parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> Over his Door was faſtened a large Golden Snout, not unlike that which is placed over the great Gates at <hi>Brazen-Noſe</hi> College in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and as it is uſual for the Learned in Foreign Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities to diſtinguiſh their Houſes by a <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence, the Doctor writ underneath this great Golden Proboſcis Two Verſes out of <hi>Ovid:</hi>

                  <l>Pontice, crede mihi, militat omnis Amans.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It is reported, That <hi>Talicotius</hi> had at one Time in his Houſe Twelve <hi>German</hi> Counts, Nineteen <hi>French</hi> Marquiſſes, and a Hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, beſides One ſolitary <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſquire, of whom more hereafter. Tho' the Doctor had the Monopoly of Noſes in his own Hands, he is ſaid not to have been unreaſonable. Indeed if a Man had Occaſion for a high <hi>Roman</hi> Noſe, he muſt go to the Price of it. A Carbuncle Noſe likewiſe bore an exceſſive Rate: But for your ordinary ſhort turned-up Noſes, of which there was the greateſt Conſumption, they coſt little or nothing; at leaſt the Purchaſers thought ſo, who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them, rather than to have gone without them.</p>
               <p>The Sympathy betwixt the Noſe and its Parent was very extraordinary. <hi>Hudibras</hi> has told us, that when the Porter died, the Noſe dropped of Courſe, in which Caſe it was always uſual to return the Noſe, in order to have it interred with its firſt Owner. The Noſe was likewiſe affected by the Pain as well as Death of the Original Proprietor. An eminent Inſtance of this Nature happen'd to Three <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe Noſes were all made out of the ſame Piece of Brawn. They found them one Day ſhoot and ſwell extremely; upon which they ſent to know how the Porter did, and heard upon Enquiry, that the Parent of the Noſes had been ſeverely kicked the Day before, and that the Porter kept his Bed on Account of the Bruiſes it had received. This was highly reſented by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who found out the Perſon that had uſed the Porter ſo unmercifully, and treated him in the ſame Manner as if the Indignity had been done to their own Noſes. In this and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes it might be ſaid, That the Porters led the Gentlemen by the Noſe.</p>

               <p>IT is the Duty of all who make Philoſophy the Entertainment of their Lives, to turn their Thoughts to practical Schemes for the Good of Society, and not paſs away their Time in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Searches, which tend rather to the Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Knowledge than the Service of Life. For this Reaſon I cannot for bear reading even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bills that are daily put into People's Hands as they paſs the Streets, which give us Notice of the preſent Reſidence, the paſt Travels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Medicines of Doctors uſeful in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, though much below the Character of the renowned <hi>Talicotius:</hi> But upon a nice Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Succeſſes of ſuch Adepts, I find their Labours tend moſtly to the enriching only one Sort of Men, that is to ſay, the Society of Upholders.

The Cenſors of <hi>Rome</hi> had Power veſted in them to lay Taxes on the unmarried; and I think I cannot ſhow my Impartiality better than in enquiring into the extravagant Privileges my Brother Batchelors enjoy, and fine them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. I ſhall not allow a ſingle Life in one Set to be reproached, and held in Eſteem in the other. It would not, methinks, be amiſs, if an old Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor, who lives in Contempt of Matrimony, were obliged to give a Portion to an old Maid who is willing to enter into it.

                  <hi>TImothy Treatall</hi> Gent. was indicated by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ladies of his Siſters Acquaintance for a very rude Affront offered to them at an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which he had invited them on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 7th of <hi>November</hi> laſt paſt, between the Hours of Eight and Nine in the Evening. The Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſet forth, That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Treatall,</hi> upon the Serving up of the Supper, deſired the Ladies to take their Places according to their different Age and Seniority, for that it was the Way always at his Table to pay Reſpect to Years. The ind ct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment added, That this produced an unſpeakable
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0397200204:334"/>
Confuſion in the Company; for that the Ladies who before had preſſed together for a Placo at the upper End of the Table, immediately crowded with the ſame Diſorder towards the End that was quite oppoſite; That Mrs. <hi>Frontly</hi> had the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuce to clap her ſelf down at the very loweſt Place of the Table; That the Widow <hi>Partlett</hi> ſeated her ſelf on the Right Hand of Mrs. <hi>Frontly,</hi> alledging for her Excuſe, that no Ceremony was to be uſed at a Round Table; That Mrs. <hi>Fidges</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Feſcue</hi> diſputed above half an Hour for the ſame Chair, and that the latter would not give up the Cauſe till it was decided by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Regiſter, which happened to be kept hard by. The Indictment further ſaid. That the reſt of the Company who ſat down, did it with a Reſerve to their Right, which they were at Liberty to aſſert on another Occaſion; and that Mrs. <hi>Mary Pippe,</hi> an old Maid, was placed by the unanimous Vote of the whole Company at the upper End of the Table, from whence ſhe had the Confuſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſeveral Mothers of Families among her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors. The Criminal alledged in his Defence, That what he had done, was to raiſe Mirth, and avoid Ceremony, and that the Ladies did not complain of his Rudeneſs till the next Morning, having eaten up what he had provided for them with great Readineſs and Alacrity. The Cenſor frowning upon him, told him, That he ought not to diſcover ſo much Levity in Matters of a ſerious Nature, and (upon the Jury's bringing him in guilty) ſentenced him to treat the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Ladies over again, and to take Care that he did it with the Decorum which was due to Perſons of their Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rebecoa Shapely,</hi> Spinſter, was indicted by Mrs. <hi>Sarah Smack,</hi> for ſpeaking many Words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiecting upon her Reputation, and the Heels of her Silk Slippers, which the Priſoner had mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſiy ſuggeſted to be two Inches higher than
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0397200204:335"/>
they really were. The Proſecutor urged, as an Aggravation of her Guilt, That the Priſoner was her ſelf guilty of the ſame Kind of Forgery which ſhe had laid to the Proſecutor's Charge, for that ſhe the ſaid <hi>Rebecca Shapely</hi> did always wear a Pair of Steel Bodice, and a falſe Rump. The Cenſor ordered the Slippers to be produced in open Court, where the Heels were adjudged to be of the Statutable Size. He then ordered the Grand Jury to ſearch the Criminal, who, after ſome Time ſpent therein, acquitted her of the Bodice, but found her guilty of the Rump; upon which ſhe received Sentence as is uſual in ſuch Caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Trippit</hi> Eſquire, of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> brought his Action againſt the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Prudely,</hi> for having refuſed him her Hand as he offered to lead her to her Coach from the Opera. The Plaintiff ſet forth, That he had entred himſelf into the Liſt of thoſe Volunteers who officiate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Night behind the Boxes as Gentlemen-Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Play-houſe; That he had been at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Charge in white Gloves, Periwigs, and Snuff-Boxes, in order to qualify himſelf for that Employment, and in Hopes of making his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by it. The Council for the Defendant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That the Plaintiff had given out that he was within a Month of wedding their Client, and that ſhe had refuſed her Hand to him in Ceremony, leſt he ſhould interpret it as a Promiſe that ſhe would give it him in Marriage. As ſoon as their Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on both Sides were finiſhed, the Cenſor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Plaintiff to be caſhier'd from his Office of Gentleman-Uſher to the Play-houſe, ſince it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill Deſign; and at the ſame Time ordered the Defendant either to marry the ſaid Plaintiff, or to pay him Half a Crown for the new Pair of Gloves and Coach-hire that he was at the Expence of in her Service.</p>

                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0397200204:336"/>
The Lady <hi>Townly</hi> brought an Action of Debt a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt Mrs. <hi>Flambeau,</hi> for that the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beau</hi> had not been to ſee the ſaid Lady <hi>Townly,</hi> and wiſh her Joy, ſince her Marriage with Sir <hi>Ralph,</hi> notwithſtanding ſhe the ſaid Lady <hi>Townly</hi> had paid Mrs. <hi>Flambeau</hi> a Viſit upon her firſt coming to Town. It was urged in the Behalf of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, That the Plaintiff had never given her any regular Notice of her being in Town; That the Viſit ſhe alledged had been made on a <hi>Monday,</hi> which ſhe knew was a Day on which Mrs. <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau</hi> was always abroad, having ſet aſide that only Day in the Week to mind the Affairs of her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That the Servant who enquired whether ſhe was at Home, did not give the Viſiting-Knock; That it was not between the Hours of Five and Eight in the Evening; That there was no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles lighted up; That it was not on Mrs. <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau</hi>'s Day; and in ſhort, That there was not one of the eſſential Points obſerved that conſtitute a Viſit. She further proved by her Porter's Book, which was produced in Court, that ſhe had paid the Lady <hi>Townly</hi> a Viſit on the Twenty fourth Day of <hi>March,</hi> juſt before her leaving the Town, in the Year 1709-10, for which ſhe was ſtill Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to the ſaid Lady <hi>Townly.</hi> To this the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff only replied, That ſhe was now under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and not liable to any Debts contracted when ſhe was a ſingle Woman. Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> finding the Cauſe to be very intricate, and that ſeveral Points of Honour were likely to ariſe in it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred giving Judgment upon it till the next Seſſion Day, at which Time he ordered the Ladies on his Left Hand to preſent to the Court a Table of all the Laws relating to Viſits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winifred Lear</hi> brought her Action againſt <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Sly,</hi> for having broken a Marriage Contract, and wedded another Woman, after he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to marry the ſaid <hi>Winifred Lear.</hi> She alledged, That he had ogled her twice ar an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0397200204:337"/>
thrice in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church, and once at <hi>Powel</hi>'s Puppet-Show, at which Time he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Marriage by a Side-Glance, as her Friend could teſtify that ſat by her. Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Defendant had made no further Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Love or Marriage, but by Looks, and Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Engagement; yet at the ſame Time conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how very apt ſuch impudent Seducers are to lead the Ladies Hearts aſtray, ordered the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to ſtand upon the Stage in the <hi>Haymarket,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each Act of the next Opera, there to be expoſed to publick View as a falſe <hi>Ogler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Riſing of the Court, Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> having taken one of theſe Counterfeits in the very Fact as he was ogling a Lady of the Grand Jury, ordered him to be ſeized, and proſecuted upon the Statute of Ogling. He likewiſe directed the Clerk of the Court to draw up an Edict againſt theſe common Cheats, that make Women believe they are diſtracted for them by ſtaring them out of Countenance, and often blaſt a Lady's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom they never ſpoke to, by ſaucy Looks and diſtant Familiarities.</p>

               <p>AN old Friend of mine being lately come to Town, I went to ſee him on <hi>Tuſday</hi> laſt about Eight a Clock in the Evening, with a Deſign to ſit with him an Hour or two, and talk over old Stories; but upon enquiring after him, his Servant told me he was juſt gone to Bed. The next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſoon as I was up and dreſſed, and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0397200204:338"/>
a little Buſineſs, I came again to my Friend's Houſe about Eleven a Clock, with a Deſign to renew my Viſit; but upon asking for him, his Servant told me he was juſt ſat down to Dinner. In ſhort, I found that my old faſhioned Friend religiouſly adhered to the Example of his Fore-fathers, and obſerved the ſame Hours that had been kept in the Family ever ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p>It is very plain, that the Night was much longer formerly in this Iſland than it is at preſent. By the Night, I mean that Portion of Time which Nature has thrown into Darkneſs, and which the Wiſdom of Mankind had formerly dedicated to Reſt and Silence. This uſed to begin at Eight a Clock in the Evening, and conclude at Six in the Morning. The Corfeu, or Eight a Clock Bell, was the Signal throughout the Nation for putting out their Candles and going to Bed.</p>
               <p>Our Grandmothers, tho' they were wont to ſit up the laſt in the Family, were all of them faſt aſleep at the ſame Hours that their Daughters are buſy at Crimp and Baſſet. Modern Stateſmen are concerting Schemes, and engaged in the Depth of Politicks, at the Time when their Fore-fathers were laid down quietly to Reſt, and had nothing in their Heads but Dreams. As we have thus thrown Buſineſs and Pleaſure into the Hours of Reſt, and by that Means made the natural Night but half as long as it ſhould be, we are forced to piece it out with a great Part of the Morning; ſo that near Two thirds of the Nation lie faſt aſleep for ſeveral Hours in broad Day-light. This Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity is grown ſo very faſhionable at preſent, that there is ſcarce a Lady of Quality in <hi>Great Britain</hi> that ever ſaw the Sun riſe. And if the Humour encreaſes in Proportion to what it has done of late Years, it is not impoſſible but our Children may hear the Bell-Man going about the Streets at Nine a Clock in the Morning, and the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0397200204:339"/>
Watch making their Rounds till Eleven. This unaccountable Diſpoſition in Mankind to continue awake in the Night, and ſleep in Sunſhine, has made me enquire, Whether the ſame Change of Inclination has happened to any other Animals? For this Reaſon I deſired a Friend of mine in the Country to let me know, Whether the Lark riſes as early as he did formerly? And whether the Cock begins to crow at his uſual Hour? My Friend has anſwered me, That his Poultry are as regular as ever, and that all the Birds and the Beaſts of his Neighbourhood keep the ſame Hours that they have obſerved in the Memory of Man; and the ſame which, in all Probability, they have kept for theſe Five Thouſand Years.</p>
               <p>If you would ſee the Innovations that have been made among us in this Particular, you may only look into the Hours of Colleges, where they ſtill dine at Eleven, and ſup at Six, which were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Hours of the whole Nation at the Time when thoſe Places were founded. But at preſent the Courts of Juſtice are ſcarce opened in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall</hi> at the Time when <hi>William Rufus</hi> uſed to go to Dinner in it. All Buſineſs is driven forward: The Land Marks of our Fathers (if I may ſo call them) are removed, and planted fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up into the Day; inſomuch that I am afraid our Clergy will be obliged (if they expect full Congregations) not to look any more upon Ten a Clock in the Morning as a Canonical Hour. In my own Memory the Dinner has crept by Degrees from Twelve a Clock to Three, and where it will fix no Body knows.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes thought to draw up a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in the Behalf of Supper againſt Dinner, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth, That the ſaid Dinner has made ſeveral Encroachments upon the ſaid Supper, and entered very far upon his Frontiers; That he has baniſhed him out of ſeveral Families, and in all has driven him from his Head Quarters, and forced him to

ſuch new Supplies of Animal Spirits, that ſhe finds her ſelf in a State of Youth, eſpecially when ſhe is entertained with the Breath of Flowers, the Melody of Birds, the Dews that hang upon the Plants, and all thoſe other Sweets of Nature that are peculiar to the Morning.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for a Man to have this Reliſh of Being, this exquiſite Taſt of Life, who does not come into the World before it is in all its Noiſe and Hurry; who loſes the Riſing of the Sun, the ſtill Hours of the Day, and immediately upon his firſt getting up plunges himſelf into the ordinary Cares or Follies of the World.</p>

What makes this Evil the much greater in Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſation is, that theſe Humdrum Companion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

They look upon Matter of Fact to be a ſufficient Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a Story, and give us a long Account of Things, not becauſe they are entertaining or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, but becauſe they are true.</p>
               <p>My ingenious Kinſman, Mr. <hi>Humphrey Wagſtaff</hi> uſes to ſay, The Life of Man is too ſhort for a Story-Teller.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Methuſalem</hi> might be half an Hour in telling what a Clock it was; but as for us Poſtdiluvians, we ought to do every Thing in Haſt; and in our Speeches, as well as Actions, remember that our Time is ſhort. A Man that talks for a Quarter of an Hour together in Company, if I meet him frequently, takes up a great Part of my Span. A Quarter of an Hour may be reckoned the Eight and fortieth Part of a Day, a Day the Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixtieth Part of a Year, and a Year the Threeſcore and tenth Part of Life. By this moral Arithmetick, ſuppoſing a Man to be in the Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World one third Part of the Day, whoever gives another a Quarter of an Hour's Hearing, makes him a Sacrifice of more than the Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſandth Part of his Converſable Life.</p>
               <p>I would eſtabliſh but one great general Rule to be obſerved in all Converſation, which is this, <hi>That Men ſhould not talk to pleaſe themſelves, but thoſe that hear them.</hi> This would make them conſider, Whether what they ſpeak be worth Hearing? Whether there be either Wit or Senſe in what they are about to ſay? And, Whether it be adapted to the Time when, the Place where, and the Perſon to whom, it is ſpoken?</p>

I have often argued, as I am a profeſſed Lover of Women, that our Sex grows old with a much worſe Grace than the other does; and have ever been of Opinion, that there are more well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed old Women than old Men. I thought it a good Reaſon for this, that the Ambition of the Fair Sex being confined to advantagious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, or ſhining in the Eyes of Men, their Parts were over ſooner, and conſequently the Errors in the Performance of them. The Converſation of this Evening has not convinced me of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for one or two Fop Women ſhall not make a Ballance for the Crowds of Coxcombs among our ſelves, diverſified according to the different Purſuits of Pleaſure and Buſineſs.</p>

Returning Home this Evening a little before my uſual Hour, I ſcarce had ſeated my ſelf in my Eaſy Chair, ſtirred the Fire, and ſtroaked my Cat, but I heard ſome Body come rumbling up Stairs. I ſaw my Door opened, and a Humane Figure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards me, ſo fantaſtically put together, 'twas ſome Minutes before I diſcovered it to be my old and intimate Friend <hi>Sam. Truſty.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately I roſe up, and placed him in my own Seat, a Compliment I pay to few. The firſt Thing he utter'd was, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Fetch me a Cup of your Cherry-Brandy before you offer to ask me any Queſtion. He drunk a luſty Draught, ſat ſilent for ſome Time, and at laſt broke out; I am come (quoth he) to inſult Thee for an old fantaſtick Dotard as thou art in ever defending the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I have this Evening viſited Two Widows, who are now in that State I have often heard you call an After-Life: I ſuppoſe you mean by it, an Exiſtence which grows out of paſt Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and is an untimely Delight in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions which they once ſet their Hearts upon too much to be ever able to relinquiſh. Have but Patience, (continued he) till I give you a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct Account of my Ladies, and of this Night's Adventure. They are much of an Age, but very different in their Characters: The one of them, with all the Advances which Years have made upon her, goes on in a certain Romantick Road of Love and Friendſhip which ſhe fell into in her Teens; the other has transferred the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Paſſions of her firſt Years to the Love of Cronies, Petts and Favourites, with which ſhe is always ſurrounded; but the Genius of each of them will beſt appear by the Account of what happened to me at their Houſes. About Five this Afternoon, being tired with Study, the Weather inviting, and Time lying a little upon my Hands, I reſolved, at the Inſtigation of my Evil Genius, to viſit them, their Husbands having been our

                  </gap> Street. I went firſt to my Lady <hi>Camomile,</hi> and the Butler, who had lived long in the Family, and ſeen me often in his Maſter's Time, uſhered me very civilly into the Parlour, and told me, Though my Lady had given ſtrict Orders to be denied, he was ſure I might be admitted, and bid the Black-Boy acquaint his Lady, that I was to wait upon her. In the Window lay Two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, one broke open, the other freſh ſealed with a Wafer: The firſt directed to the Divine <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia,</hi> the ſecond to the Charming <hi>Lucinda;</hi> but both, by the indented Characters, appeared to have been writ by very unſteady Hands. Such uncommon Addreſſes increaſed my Curioſity, and put me upon asking my old Friend the Butler, If he knew who thoſe Perſons were? Very well, ſays he: This is from Mrs. <hi>Furbiſh</hi> to my Lady, an old School-Fellow and great Crony of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip's, and this the Anſwer. I enquired in what Country ſhe lived. Oh dear! ſays he, but juſt by in the Neighbourhood. Why, ſhe was here all this Morning, and that Letter came and was anſwered within theſe Two Hours. They have taken an odd Fancy, you muſt know, to call one another hard Names, but for all that they love one another hugely. By this Time the Boy returned with his Lady's humble Service to me, deſiring I would excuſe her, for ſhe could not poſſibly ſee me, nor any Body elſe, for it was Opera Night.</p>
               <p>Methinks, (ſays I) ſuch innocent Folly as Two old Women's Courtſhip to each other ſhould rather make you merry, than put you out of Humour. Peace, good <hi>Iſaac,</hi> (ſays he) no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption I beſeech you. I got ſoon to Mrs. <hi>Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>'s, ſhe that was formerly <hi>Betty Frisk;</hi> you muſt needs remember het, <hi>Tom. Feeble</hi> of <hi>Brazen-Noſe</hi> fell in Love with her for her fine Dancing.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0397200204:353"/>
Well, Mrs. <hi>Urſula,</hi> without further Ceremony, carries me directly up to her Miſtreſs's Chamber, where I found her environ'd by Four of the moſt miſchievous Animals that can ever infeſt a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: An old Shock Dog with one Eye, a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key chaned to one Side of the Chimney, a great grey Squirrel to the other, and a Parrat wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in the middle of the Room. However, for a while, all was in a profound Tranquillity. Upon the Mantle-Tree, for I am a pretty curious Obſerver, ſtood a Pot of Lambetive Electuary, with a Stick of Liquoriſh, and near it a Phyal of Roſe-Water and Powder of Tutty. Upon the Table lay a Pipe filled with Bettony and Colts-Foot, a Roll of Wax-Candle, a Silver Spitting-Pot, and a <hi>Seville</hi> Orange. The Lady was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a large Wicker Chair, and her Feet wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in Flannel, ſupported by Cuſhions; and in this Attitude (would you believe it <hi>Iſaac</hi>) was ſhe reading a Romance with Spectacles on. The firſt Compliments over, as ſhe was induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly endeavouring to enter upon Converſation, a violent Fit of Coughing ſeized her. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened Shock, and in a Trice the whole Room was in an Uproar; for the Dog barked, the Squirrel ſquealed, the Monkey chattered, the Parrat ſcreamed, and <hi>Urſula,</hi> to appeaſe them, was more clamorous than all the reſt. You <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who know how any harſh Noiſe affects my Head, may gueſs what I ſuffered from the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Din of theſe diſcordant Sounds. At length all was appeaſed, and Quiet reſtored: A Chair was drawn for me, where I was no ſooner ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Parrat fixed his Horny Beak, as ſharp as a Pair of Sheers, in one of my Heels, juſt above the Shoe. I ſprung from the Place with an unuſual Agility, and ſo being within the Monkey's Reach, he ſnatches off my n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0397200204:354"/>
nimble enough to ſave it from any further Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage than ſingeing the Foretop. I put it on, and compoſing my ſelf as well as I could, I drew my Chair towards the other Side of the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The good Lady, as ſoon as ſhe had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Breath, employed it in making a Thouſand Apologies, and with great Eloquence, and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train of Words, lamented my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. In the middle of her Harangue, I felt ſomething ſcratching near my Knee, and feeling what it ſhould be, found the Squirrel had got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Coat-Pocket. As I endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from his Burrow, he made his Teeth meet through the Fleſhy Part of my Fore-Finger. This gave me an unexpreſſible Pain. The <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> Water was immediately brought to bath it, and Gold-beaters Skin applied to ſtop the Blood. The Lady renewed her Excuſes; but being now out of all Patience, I abruptly took my Leave, and hobbling down Stairs with heedleſs Haſt, I ſet my Foot full in a Pail of Water, and down we came to the Bottom together. Here my Friend concluded his Narrative, and, with a compoſed Countenance, I began to make him Compliments of Condoleance; but he ſtarted from his Chair, and ſaid, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> you may ſpare your Speeches, I expect no Reply: When I told you this, I knew you would laugh at me; but the next Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that makes me ridiculous ſhall be a young one.</p>

               <p>I Have heard, that it is a Rule among the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventuals of ſeveral Orders in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to ſhut themſelves up at a certain Time of the Year, not only from the World in general, but from the Members of their own Fraternity, and to paſs away ſeveral Days by themſelves in ſettling Accounts between their Maker and their own Souls, in cancelling unrepented Crimes, and renewing their Contracts of Obedience for the future. Such ſtated Times for particular Acts of Devotion, or the Exerciſe of certain religious Duties, have been enjoined in all civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whatever Deity they worſhipped, or whatever Religion they profeſſed. That which may be done at all Times, is often totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and forgotten, unleſs fixed and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome Time more than another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though ſeveral Duties may be ſuitable to every Day of our Lives, they are moſt likely to be performed if ſome Days are more particularly ſet apart for the Practice of them. Our Church has accordingly inſtituted ſeveral Seaſons of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, when Time, Cuſtom, Preſcription, and (if I may ſo ſay) the Faſhion it ſelf, call upon a Man to be ſerious and attentive to the great End of his Being.</p>

I have hinted in ſome former Papers, that the greateſt and wiſeſt of Men in all Ages and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, particularly in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their Piety and Virtue. It is now my Intention to ſhow how thoſe in our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that have been unqueſtionably the moſt eminent for Learning and Knowledge, were likewiſe the moſt eminent for their Adherence to the Religion of their Country.</p>
               <p>I might produce very ſhining Examples from among the Clergy; but becauſe Prieſtcraft is the common Cry of every cavelling empty Scribbler, I ſhall ſhow, that all the Laymen who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted a more than ordinary Genius in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and were the Glory of their Times, were Men whoſe Hopes were filled with Immortality, and the Proſpect of future Rewards, and Men who lived in a dutiful Submiſſion to all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Revealed Religion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in this Paper only inſtance Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> a Man who for the Greatneſs of Genius, and Compaſs of Knowledge, did Honour to his Age and Country; I could almoſt ſay to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature it ſelf. He poſſeſſed at once all thoſe extraordinary Talents which were divided amongſt the greateſt Authors of Antiquity. He had the ſound, diſtinct, comprehenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> with all the beautiful Lights, Graces and Embelliſhments, of <hi>Cicero.</hi> One does not know which to admire moſt in his Writings, the Strength of Reaſon, Force of Style, or Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Imagination.</p>
               <p>This Author has remarked in ſeveral Parts of his Works, that a thorough Infight into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy makes a good Believer, and that a Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in it naturally produces ſuch a Race of deſpicable Infidels as the little profligate Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the preſent Age, whom (I muſt confeſs) I have always accuſed to my ſelf, not ſo much for their Want of Faith as their Want of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

I was infinitely pleaſed to find among the Works of this extraordinary Man a Prayer of his own compoſing, which, for the Elevation of Thought, and Greatneſs of Expreſſion, ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devotion of an Angel than a Man. His principal Fault ſeems to have been the Exceſs of that Virtue which covers a Multitude of Faults. This betrayed him to ſo great an Indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Servants, who made a corrupt Uſe of it, that it ſtrip'd him of all thoſe Riches and Honours which a long Series of Merits had heaped upon him. But in this Prayer, at the ſame Time that we find him proſtrating himſelf before the great Mercy-Seat, and humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Afflictions which at that Time lay heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, we ſee him ſupported by the Senſe of his Integrity, his Zeal, his Devotion, and his Love to Mankind, which give him a much higher Figure in the Minds of Thinking Men, than that Greatneſs had done from which he was fallen. I ſhall beg Leave to write down the Prayer it ſelf, with the Title to it, as it was found among his Lordſhip's Papers, written in his own Hand; not being able to furniſh my Reader with an Entertainment more ſuitable to this ſolemn Time.</p>

<p>MOST gracious Lord God, my merciful Father; from my Youth up my Creator, my Redeemer, my Comforter. Thou, O Lord, ſoundeſt and ſearcheſt the Depths and Secrets of all Hearts; Thou acknowledgeſt the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of Heart; Thou judgeſt the Hypocrite; Thou pondereſt Men's Thoughts and Doings as in a Ballance; Thou meaſureſt their Intentions as with a Line; Vanity and crooked Ways cannot be hid from Thee.</p>

Remember, O Lord! how thy Servant hath walked before thee; remember what I have firſt ſought, and what hath been principal in my Intentions. I have loved thy Aſſemblies, I have mourned for the Diviſions of thy Church, I have delighted in the Brightneſs of thy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. This Vine which thy Right Hand hath planted in this Nation, I have ever pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Thee that it might have the firſt and the latter Rain, and that it might ſtretch her Branches to the Seas, and to the Floods. The State and Bread of the Poor and Oppreſſed have been precious in mine Eyes; I have hated all Cruelty and Hardneſs of Heart; I have (though in a deſpiſed Weed) procured the Good of all Men. If any have been my Enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath the Sun almoſt ſet upon my Diſpleaſure; but I have been as a Dove, free from Superfluity of Maliciouſneſs. Thy Creatures have been my Books, but thy Scriptures much more. I have ſought Thee in the Courts, Fields and Gardens, but I have found Thee in thy Temples.</p>
                  <p>Thouſands have been my Sins, and Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands my Tranſgreſſions, but thy Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have remained with me, and my Heart (through thy Grace) hath been an unquenched Coal upon thine Altar.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, my Strength! I have ſince my Youth met with Thee in all my Ways, by thy Fatherly Compaſſions, by thy comfortable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, and by thy moſt viſible Providence. As thy Favours have increaſed upon me, ſo have thy Corrections; ſo as Thou haſt been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near me, O Lord! And ever as my Worldly Bleſſings were exalted, ſo ſecret Darts from Thee have pierced me; and when I have aſcended before Men, I have deſcended in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation before Thee. And now when I thought moſt of Peace and Honour, thy Hand
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0397200204:359"/>
is heavy upon me, and hath humbled me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy former loving Kindneſs, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſtill in thy Fatherly School, not as a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, but as a Child. Juſt are thy Judgments upon me for my Sins, which are more in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the Sands of the Sea, but have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thy Mercies; for what are the Sands of the Sea? Earth, Heavens, and all theſe, are nothing to thy Mercies. Beſides my innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Sins, I confeſs before Thee, that I am Debtor to Thee for the gracious Talent of thy Gifts and Graces, which I have neither put into a Napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, where it might have made beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but miſpent it in Things for which I was leaſt fit: So I may truly ſay, my Soul hath been a Stranger in the Courſe of my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Saviour's Sake, and receive me unto thy Boſom, or guide me in thy Ways.</p>

overthrow what the other has ſaid before him, and may in the ſame Manner be ſucceeded by any other Politician, who ſhall with the ſame Liberty confirm or impugn his Reaſons, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or invalidate his Conjectures, enlarge upon his Schemes, or erect new ones of his own. We do likewiſe further propoſe, That if any Perſon, of what Age or Rank ſoever, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to cavil at any Paper that has been read, or to hold forth upon it longer than the Space of one Minute, that he be immediately ordered up into the Pulpit, there to make good any Thing that he has ſuggeſted upon the Floor.

                  <hi>Epictetus,</hi> in his little Syſtem of Morality, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the following Rule with that beautiful Simplicity which ſhines through all his Precepts. <hi>Beware that thou never tell thy Dreams in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for notwithſtanding thou may'ſt take a Pleaſure in Telling thy Dreams, the Company will take no Pleaſure in Hearing them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Rule is conformable to a Maxim which I have laid down in a late Paper, and muſt always inculcate into thoſe of my Readers who find in themſelves an Inclination to be very talkative and impertinent, That they ſhould not ſpeak to pleaſe themſelves, but thoſe that hear them.</p>
               <p>It has been often obſerved by witty Eſſay-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, That the deepeſt Waters are always the moſt ſilent; That empty Veſſels make the greateſt Sound, and tinckling Cymbals the worſt Muſick.

                     <p>'TIS my Misfortune to be enamoured of a Lady that is neither very beautiful, very witty, nor at all well-natured; but has the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to think ſhe excels in all theſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore is cruel, inſolent, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. When I ſtudy to pleaſe her, ſhe treats me with the utmoſt Rudeneſs and ill Manners: If I approach her Perſon, ſhe fights, ſhe ſcratches me: If I offer a civil Salute, ſhe bites me; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that very lately, before a whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Ladies and Gentlemen, ſhe rip'd out a conſiderable Part of my Left Cheek. This is no ſooner done, but ſhe begs my Pardon in the moſt handſome and becoming Terms imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gives her ſelf worſe Language than I could

find in my Heart to do, lets me embrace her to pacify her while ſhe is railing at her ſelf, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts ſhe deſerves the Eſteem of no one living, ſays I am too good to contradict her when ſhe thus accuſes her ſelf. This attones for all, tempts me to renew my Addreſſes, which are ever returned in the ſame obliging Manner. Thus, without ſome ſpeedy Relief, I am in Danger of loſing my whole Face. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, I doat upon her, and am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied ſhe loves me, becauſe ſhe takes me for a Man of Senſe, which I have generally thought, except in this one Inſtance.

'Tis an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of jeſting on diſagreeable Subjects, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on the Jeſt, the more it creates Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and this ſome Men think they have a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to do as Friends. Is the Deſign of Jeſting to provoke? Or does Friendſhip give a Privilege to ſay Things with a Deſign to ſhock? How can that be call'd a Jeſt, which has nothing in it but Bitterneſs? 'Tis generally allow'd neceſſary,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0397200204:367"/>
for the Peace of Company, that Men ſhould a little ſtudy the Tempers of each others; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that muſt be in order to ſhun what's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, not to make it a conſtant Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The frequent Repetition of what appears harſh, will unavoidably leave a Rancour that's fatal to Friendſhip; and I doubt much, whether it would be an Argument of a Man's good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, if he ſhould be rouzed by perpetual Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, to treat thoſe that do it as his Enemies. In a Word, whereas 'tis a common Practice to let a Story die, meerly becauſe it does not touch, I think ſuch as mention one they find does, are as troubleſome to Society, and as unfit for it, as <hi>Wags, Men of Fire, good Talkers,</hi> or any other Apes in Converſation; and therefore, for the publick Benefit, I hope you'll cauſe them to be branded with ſuch a Name as they deſerve.

                     <p>IT has been the peculiar Bleſſing of our Family to be always above the Smiles or Frowns of Fortune, and by a certain Greatneſs of Mind to reſtrain all irregular Fondneſſes or Paſſions. From hence it is, that though a long Decay, and a numerous Deſcent, have obliged many of our Houſe to fall into the Arts of Trade and Buſineſs, no one Perſon of us has ever made an Appearance that betrayed our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſatisfied with our own Station of Life,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0397200204:370"/>
or has ever affected a Mien or Geſture unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it.</p>
                     <p>You have up and down in your Writings very juſtly remarked, That it is not this or the other Profeſſion or Quality among Men that gives us Honour and Eſteem, but the well or ill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves in thoſe Characters. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with no ſmall Concern, that I behold in Coffee-houſes and publick Places my Brethren, the Tradeſmen of this City, put off the ſmooth, even and ancient Decorum of thriving Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, for a fantaſtical Dreſs and Figure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for their Perſons and Characters, to the utter Deſtruction of that Order and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which of Right ought to be between St. <hi>James</hi>'s and <hi>Milkſtreet,</hi> the Camp and <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have given my ſelf ſome Time to find out, how diſtinguiſhing the Frays in a Lot of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, or drawing up a Regiment of Thread Laces, or making a Panegyrick on Pieces of Sagathy or <hi>Scotch</hi>-Plod, ſhould entitle a Man to a Laced Hat or Sword, a Wig tied up with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or an embroidered Coat. The College ſay, this Enormity proceeds from a Sort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium in the Brain, which makes it break out firſt about the Head, and, for Want of timely Remedies, fall upon the Left Thigh, and from thence in little Mazes and Windings run over the whole Body, as appears by pretty Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Buttons, Button-holes, Garter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Sides of the Breeches, and the like.

For this Reaſon I am more provoked at the Allegations relating to the Clergyman, than any other hinted at in theſe Complaints. I have indeed a long Time with much Concern obſerved abundance of <hi>Pretty Fellows</hi> in Sacred
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0397200204:373"/>
Orders, and ſhall in due Time let them know, that I pretend to give <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as well as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Cenſures. A Man well bred and well dreſſed in that Habit, adds to the Sacredneſs of his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Agreeableneſs not to be met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Laity. I own I have ſpent ſome Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among the Men of Wit of that Profeſſion with an inexpreſſible Delight. Their habitual Care of their Character gives ſuch a Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Fancy, that all which they utter in Company is as much above what you meet with in other Converſations, as the Charms of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt are ſuperior to thoſe of a light Woman. I therefore earneſtly deſire our young Miſſionaries from the Univerſities to conſider where they are, and not dreſs, and look, and move like young Officers. It is no Diſadvantage to have a very handſome white Hand; but were I to preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to a Gallery of Ladies, I would, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, keep my Gloves on. I have an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Affection to the Claſs of Mankind appointed to ſerve at the Altar, therefore am in Danger of running out of my Way, and growing too ſerious on this Occaſion; for which Reaſon I ſhall end with the following Epiſtle, which, by my Intereſt in <hi>Tom.

               <p>THE Printer having informed me, That there are as many of theſe Papers printed as will make Four Volumes, I am now come to the End of my Ambition in this Matter, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to ſay to the World, under the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Iſaac Bickerſtaff.</hi> This Work has indeed for ſome Time been diſagreeable to me, and the Purpoſe of it wholly loſt by my being ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as the Author. I never deſigned in it to give any Man any ſecret Wound by my Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſpoke in the Character of an old Man, a Philoſopher, an Humoriſt, an Aſtrologer, and a Cenſor, to allure my Reader with the Variety of my Subjects, and inſinuate, if I could, the Weight of Reaſon with the Agreeableneſs of Wit. The general Purpoſe of the whole has been to recommend Truth, Innocence, Honour, and Virtue, as the chief Ornaments of Life; but I conſidered, that Severity of Manners was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to him who would cenſure others, and for that Reaſon, and that only, choſe to talk in a Mask. I ſhall not carry my Humility ſo far as to call my ſelf a vicious Man; but at the ſame Time muſt confeſs, my Life is at beſt but pardonable. And with no greater Character
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0397200204:375"/>
than this, a Man would make but an indifferent Progreſs in attacking prevailing and faſhionable Vices, which Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> has done with a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Spirit that would have loſt both its Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Efficacy, had it been pretended to by Mr. <hi>Steele.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Work it ſelf, the Acceptance it has met with is the beſt Proof of its Value; but I ſhould err againſt that Candour which an honeſt Man ſhould always carry about him, if I did not own, that the moſt approved Pieces in it were written by others, and thoſe which have been moſt excepted againſt by my ſelf. The Hand that has aſſiſted me in thoſe noble Diſcourſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Immortality of the Soul, the glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of another Life, and the moſt ſublime Idea's of Religion and Virtue, is a Perſon who is too fondly my Friend ever to own them; but I ſhould little deſerve to be his, if I uſurped the Glory of them. I muſt acknowledge at the ſame Time, that I think the fineſt Strokes of Wit and Humour in all Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi>'s Lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are thoſe for which he is alſo beholden to him.</p>
               <p>As for the Satyrical Parts of theſe Writings, thoſe againſt the Gentlemen who profeſs Gaming are the moſt licentious; but the main of them I take to come from loſing Gameſters, as Invectives againſt the Fortunate; for in very many of them, I was very little elſe but the Tranſcriber. If any have been more particularly marked at, ſuch Perſons may impute it to their own Behaviour, (before they were touched upon) in publickly ſpeaking their Reſentment againſt the Author, and profeſſing they would ſupport any Man who ſhould inſult him. When I mention this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I hope Major-General <hi>Davenport,</hi> Brigadier <hi>Biſſet,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> will accept of my Thanks for their frequent good Offices, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their Readineſs to partake any Danger
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0397200204:376"/>
that ſhould befal me in ſo juſt an Undertaking as the Endeavour to baniſh Fraud and Couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage from the Preſence and Converſation of Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>But what I find is the leaſt excuſable Part of all this Work is, That I have, in ſome Places in it, touched upon Matters which concern both the Church and State. All I ſhall ſay for this is, That the Points I alluded to are ſuch as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Chriſtian and Freeholder in <hi>England;</hi> and I could not be cold enough to conceal my Opinion on Subjects which related to either of thoſe Characters. But Politicks apart. I muſt confeſs, it has been a moſt exquiſite Pleaſure to me to frame Characters of Domeſtick Life, and put thoſe Parts of it which are leaſt obſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an agreeable View; to enquire into the Seeds of Vanity and Affectation, to lay before my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Emptineſs of Ambition: In a Word, to trace Humane Life through all its Mazes and Receſſes, and ſhow much ſhorter Methods than Men ordinarily practiſe, to be happy, agreeable, and great.</p>
               <p>But to enquire into Men's Faults and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes has ſomething in it ſo unwelcome, that I have often ſeen People in Pain to act before me, whoſe Modeſty only make them think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liable to Cenſure. This, and a Thouſand other nameleſs Things, have made it an irkſome Task to me to perſonate Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and I believe it does not often happen, that the Reader is delighted where the Author is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.</p>
               <p>All I can now do for the further Gratification of the Town, is to give them a faithful Index and Explication of Paſſages and Alluſions, and ſometimes of Perſons intended in the ſeveral ſcattered Parts of the Work. At the ſame Time, the ſucceeding Volumes ſhall diſcover which of the whole have been written by me, and which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0397200204:377"/>
by others, and by whom, as far as I am able, or permitted.</p>
               <p>Thus I have voluntarily done what I think all Authors ſhould do when call'd upon. I have publiſhed my Name to my Writings, and given my ſelf up to the Mercy of the Town (as <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi> expreſſes it) with all my Imperfections on my Head.
